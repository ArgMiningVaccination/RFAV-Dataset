In preparation for this, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) and the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board (DC PCSB) asked LEAs to develop Continuous Education and School Recovery Plans for the 2020-21 school year. OSSE required all LEAs in the District of Columbia that serve students in grades K-12 to submit continuous education plans in order to waive the requirement that a school year include a minimum of 180 instructional days at 6 hours per day as prescribed in 5-A DCMR \u00a72100.3. DC PCSB required all public charter school LEAs to submit continuous education plans to capture school academic and operational changes during the 2020-21 school year in response to COVID-19. These plans must meet certain baseline requirements\u2014namely, completion, clarity, alignment with applicable laws and policies delineated throughout this application, and for public charter schools, alignment with their approved charters. In addition, all plans must align with public health guidelines. The plan below has been approved for these purposes. This plan is intended to provide the public with information on how the LEA has prepared for the 2020-21 school year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. LEAs have the flexibility to design continuous education and school recovery plans to best fit their individual or specific needs. LEAs may periodically update plans based on the evolving nature of the District's response to the pandemic. Additional questions pertaining to the implementation of these plans should be directed to the school and LEA. 1Term used to describe situations in which students access instruction from a location outside of the physical school building, whether delivered synchronously or asynchronously; distance learning is synonymous with remote learning. 2These policies are intended to capture school academic and operational changes during the 2020-21 school year in response to COVID-19. If a charter LEA intends to make any major academic or operational shifts for future school years (2021-22 or beyond), please reach out to DC PCSB staff to discuss memorializing those changes in a charter amendment. 3Refer to health guidance for child care and schools, available here: https://coronavirus.dc.gov/healthguidance . Note that this guidance is subject to change due to the need to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic. LEAs are responsible for incorporating additional public health guidance into their policies as such guidance is released. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 1 Application Questions School Recovery Operations Plan The Mundo Verde c leaning, disinfecting, sanitizing protocols and schedules outlined below provide a description of our plan to keep building clean and articulate what takes place weekly, daily, and multiple times per day. We provide a list of what is normally provided (\"regular\" cleaning) as well as what has been modified/enhanced due to the COVID-19 health emergency. Finally, as Mundo Verde is opening the school year in fully remote learning, a distinction is made between deep cleaning that will take place during fully remote learning, versus deep cleaning that will take place when students are back on site. The final section provides an overview of the specific protocols implement in the event that an individual in a school community tests positive for COVID-19. Overview of Cleaning Schedules Regular Schedule for Cleaning, Disinfecting and Sanitizing The school will regularly clean, disinfect, and sanitize surfaces, toys, and materials per District guidance on cleaning and disinfecting and the CDC's Reopening Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfecting Public Spaces, Workplaces, Businesses, Schools, and Homes . Note that these guidelines may change over time. The school will adhere to the following: Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched. This includes cleaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, door pushes, stairwell handles, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops, desk tops) For all cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products, follow the manufacturer's instructions for concentration, application method, contact time, and drying time before use by a child. See CDC's guidance for safe and correct application of disinfectants . Place signage in every classroom, office space, and common space reminding staff of cleaning protocols. Develop and implement a schedule for increased routine cleaning, disinfection and sanitization. Use of shared objects (e.g., gym or physical education equipment, art supplies, toys, games) will be limited and cleaned between cohorts. In most instances, materials will not be shared. Toys, including those used indoors and outdoors, will be frequently cleaned and sanitized throughout the day if used by students. Machine washable items should be used by only one child and laundered in between uses. Mats/cots and bedding are to be individually labeled and stored in the classrooms. Mats/cots will be placed at least six feet apart and arranged from head to toe while in use and cleaned and sanitized between uses. Bedding will be washable and returned to families to launder weekly. Mats/cots may be stacked between uses if they are cleaned and sanitized appropriately before stacking. Playground structures will be included as part of routine cleaning (as defined in District guidance on cleaning and disinfecting ), especially high-touch surfaces (e.g., handlebars), but do not need to be disinfected. 1.Describe the LEA's plan to keep buildings clean, including: What is the cleaning schedule? For example, what happens weekly, daily, and multiple times per day?; and How you will ensure buildings are clean if/when an individual in a school community tests positive for COVID-19 (e.g., work with an outside vendor specializing in deep cleaning or train in-house janitorial staff to ensure cleaning standards are met)? Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 2 Shared bathrooms will be assigned to specific clusters of students and staff. Each cluster may have specific times during the daily schedule to use their assigned bathroom. Bathrooms will be cleaned and disinfected frequently. Mundo Verde is not operating our shuttle buses at this time but if we decide to start shuttle buses again, drivers will practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff (e.g., CLEANING, DISINFECTION, SANITATION; HYGIENE; NON-MEDICAL (CLOTH) FACE COVERINGS). Mundo Verde will continue to implement safe and correct storage for cleaning and disinfection products. Staff will ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products. COVID-19 Modifications There are three primary adjustments to the regular schedule to adapt to COVID-19. See below in summary. Additional detail is provided in the Specifications and Frequencies section below. Wednesday Deep Clean Schedule : This will be the off day during hybrid learning - with no students in the building. Carpets will be deep cleaned and shampooed as needed. Restrooms will be buffed and prepared for the second student cohort. 1.

Electro-Hygiene Atomizers are different from Electrostatic in that they do not electrically charge the solution. Electro-Hygiene technology utilizes ULV (Ultra Low Volume) cold atomizing which attains the same end result but with a more high production and high capacity units. Both processes are designed to kill 99.99% of any pathogen including SARS-CV-2. 2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Cleaning Personnel : The majority of Mundo Verde's cleaning personnel are contracted through vendors. All PPE for Contractor's employees will be provided by Contractor for the performance of the Scope of Work. PPE is defined as: masks, gloves, protective eyewear, face shield, protective gowning.

Machine scrub restroom floors COVID-19 Specific Cleaning Specifications and Frequencies During fully remote learning, the regular cleaning schedule itemized above will be followed or modified as needed to meet the needs of the campus. There will be a weekly disinfecting spray treatment and daily HTS disinfecting. Special projects and focused deep cleaning will occur as needed. Once students are back in the building, deeper cleans will take place twice a week in between hybrid cohort switches (Wednesdays and Fridays). Legend: C= Clean D = Disinfect S = Sanitize In the event a space in the school is used for an aerosol-generating procedure (e.g., tracheostomy suctioning), that room should be only occupied by the student or staff member engaged in the treatment. If tracheostomy suctioning is needed multiple times a day, a well ventilated room is dedicated for this Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 7 purpose The room must be closed for 24 hours after the treatment to allow respiratory droplets to settle, then cleaned and disinfected prior to use by another individual. MV will encourage families and the school nurse to identify opportunities to transition the schedule for tracheostomy suctioning to before or after school, if medically appropriate. Spaces in which oral or nebulized medication has been administered should undergo routine cleaning and disinfection. Students who receive nebulized treatments should be strongly encouraged to replace the nebulizer with oral inhalers whenever possible. If students cannot use or do not have access to an inhaler, treatment will be provided outside, if feasible and weather permitting. MV strongly encourages families and the school nurse to identify opportunities to transition the schedule for nebulized medication administration to before or after school, if medically appropriate. Positive COVID-19 Case Cleaning Schedule In the event of a positive COVID-19 case in the school community, the school will control spread by disinfecting all exposed materials, and limit personnel from entering the contaminated area(s). No individual(s) will be allowed in the potentially contaminated area(s) directly following identification of a known positive case without gloves and masks and other PPE, as deemed necessary. The school cleaning vendor will be notified and asked to conduct thorough cleaning and disinfecting. In addition to these routine cleaning requirements, the following protocols apply in circumstances in which a student or staff member becomes ill. Student or staff member develops symptoms of COVID-19 throughout the school day but is not confirmed to have COVID-19: Immediately rope off or close, clean and disinfect areas and equipment in which the ill individual has been in contact. Once the room is vacated at the end of the day, perform deep cleaning and disinfection of full classroom, and any other spaces or equipment in which the ill individual was in contact. This includes the isolation room after use by an ill student or staff member. 14 Staff supporting, accompanying or cleaning up after a sick student or staff member must adhere to PPE requirements In the event of a confirmed COVID-19 case in a student or staff member, the school will follow all steps outlined by DC Health as well as the cleaning, disinfection and sanitization guidance from the CDC, linked here: If seven days or fewer have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, we will follow these steps: Close off areas used by the person who is sick. Note: If it is during the day when the COVID-19 case is confirmed AND the COVID-19 positive individual was appropriately excluded from in-person activities while awaiting test results, it is acceptable to close, clean, and disinfect spaces used by the COVID-19 positive individual after the students and staff in those spaces leave for the day. 1. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the areas.2. Wait up to 24 hours or as long as possible before cleaning or disinfecting to allow respiratory droplets 3. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 8 to settle. Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as classrooms, bathrooms, and common areas.4. If more than seven days have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Routine cleaning and disinfection will continue. In addition, the deep cleaning normally scheduled for twice a week between learning cohorts will be activated for designated areas. Mundo Verde is implement the following p hysical changes to our school environment to promote social distancing. We are calling this \"Spatial Distancing\" to emphasize the focus on space and distance over social and the emotional connection that is still needed between people even in spatially distanced environments. Physical Changes to the Environment to Promote Spatial (Social) Distancing Use of Space Mundo Verde will take the following measures in its use of space: Maximize spacing of occupants in each space with a minimum of six feet distance between desks. Limit occupants in any space based on the \"Phase\" per the DC Health requirement or the square footage available, whichever is less. Current allowance is 12 individuals plus one additional staff (13 total individuals) briefly added to the class as necessary to support individual student needs Students will have assigned seats throughout the day. They will face the same direction when possible given furniture restrictions to reduce transmission from virus-containing droplets (e.g., from talking, coughing, sneezing). Physical barriers will be provided for close up individual student/teacher work Individual desks will all be turned to face the same direction and students will be staggered to maintain six feet distance. Individual carpet squares that will be cleaned daily will be used during floor time or classroom carpets will be removed and replaced with yoga mats. Each student will be assigned a single square or yoga mat. The squares/mats will be six feet apart and disinfected between cohorts. No more than 3 students will be assigned a table designed for 6, and no more than 2 at tables designed for 4. If sitting across from one-another, students will maintain a 6-foot distance. 6 feet of distance will be maintained in each scenario. Communal-use spaces will be closed except for scheduled access if needed. Communal-use spaces not closed will stagger use providing time for cleaning and disinfecting between use and maintain six feet of distancing at all times. Photocopier, cutting boards, book rooms, etc. Playground, balls and recess equipment Refrigerator, microwaves, etc. for staff Physical education classes will be held outside, weather permitting and students will maintain proper distancing using visual cues (e.g., mark the ground where students should stand). No interactive activities will be permitted (e.g. basketball, football, soccer)2.Describe physical changes to the environment to ensure or promote social distancing. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 9 Physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, will be installed at the front desks. A designated area, with its own ventilation if possible, will be available for any student or staff who exhibit symptoms, such as a fever or a cough, until the individual can be safely removed from the facility. This area will be separate from the area used for routine healthcare. During in-person learning, outdoor spaces will be used for recess and classroom instruction. Outdoor areas will be divided into designated sections and scheduled to allow only one class in a section at one time. Students and staff will be clustered in the building to limit the amount of cross contamination. This means each cluster will only use certain restrooms, hallways, and doors during the day. Isolation Room Mundo Verde will identify a well-ventilated space to the extent possible to isolate sick individuals until they are able to leave the school grounds. The space will be in an area that is not frequently passed or used by other students or staff, not behind a barrier, and that is not the health suite. If safe and nice weather, we will isolate sick individuals outdoors. When in the isolation area, the sick individual must always wear a non- medical (cloth) face covering or surgical mask, be within sight of the supervising staff member, and be physically separated from other individuals by at least 6 feet. To the extent feasible, MV will isolate only one sick individual in the isolation suite at a time. The isolation area must be immediately cleaned and disinfected after the sick individual departs. Use of Hallway Hallways will include occupant traffic flow direction marking on the floor, maintaining one-way traffic where possible and two-way traffic separated by six feet or maximum possible where space is not sufficient. Additional signage including floor markers and wall signage will be used as needed to provide direction and instruction for movement. Extra time will be allowed between classes to foster careful transition between spaces. Students will be escorted by teachers/staff at all times. Mundo Verde is implement the following changes to our building systems to ensure adequacy of ventilation in our buidlings and to ensure the highest quality fresh water. Maintenance of and Improvements to Ventilation and Water Systems While Mundo Verde buildings were never fully closed, after a prolonged shutdown, we will ensure building systems, such as ventilation and water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, decorative fountains), are safe to use. Prior to reopening after any prolonged shutdown, the school will engage with our vendor responsible for maintaining our heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC) at each building to ensure the systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible. Windows and doors will be opened where possible to maximize air quality for occupants while considering safety and health risks such as risk of falling, outdoor air quality triggering asthma symptoms, building fire safety, and security. Adequacy of Ventilation3.What have you done to ensure adequacy of ventilation at the school? Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 10 Refer to health guidance for childcare and schools, available here: https://coronavirus.dc.gov/healthguidance .Mundo Verde worked with Interface Engineering to assess both campus HVAC Systems for adequate ventilation to mitigate risk of exposure and contagion to COVID-19. The following recommendations for upgrades to the systems will be implemented at each campus: Cook Campus: Testing and balancing Point of use humidification Daily pre-occupancy flush Maximize ventilation airflow Airstream neutralization with Bi-polar Ionization at RTU supply ducts Merv-13 filters in classroom units where available Routine maintenance and filter changes Calle Ocho Campus: Testing and balancing Point of use humidification Daily pre-occupancy flush Maximize ventilation airflow Airstream neutralization with Bi-polar Ionization at RTU supply ducts Routine maintenance and filter changes Opening windows and doors will only occur if doing so does not pose a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to students and staff using the facility. Under no circumstances may fire-rated doors be propped or otherwise left open. Plumbing Systems and Quality of Water Prior to reopening after any prolonged shutdown, the school will flush all water systems to clear out stagnant water and replace it with fresh water. This process will remove any metals (e.g., lead) that may have leached into the water and minimize risk of Legionnaires' disease and other diseases associated with water following CDC guidance and as described below: Flush hot and cold water through all points of use such as sinks, drinking fountains, toilets, urinals, and showers. Water heater will be set to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and hot water will be flushed at each fixture using hot water until its maximum temperature is reached. Additional water using devices, such as ice machines and drinking water dispensers, will be flushed in accordance with manufacturers' instructions. Drinking fountains will be closed on reopening, only refilling of water bottles will be allowed. WIth respect to sanitiation in bathrooms, Mundo Verde will also be doing routine maintenance and adding toilet seat covers to all seats. Mundo Verde is implement the following procedures with respect to school operations to ensure safe access to 4.Outline the LEA's plan for 2020-21 school year school operations to ensure all students have safe access to instruction, either in person or at home. Describe, in detail,student and staff schedules, arrival/dismissal procedures,plan for distributing educational materials, plan to oversee before/after care and extracurricular activities, plan to providemeals, and plan to provide personal protective equipment (PPE). Be sure to follow the public health guidance. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 11 instruction at home. Below you will find details on student and staff schedules, arrival/dismissal procedures, plan for distributing educational materials, plan to oversee before/after care and extracurricular activities, plan to provide meals, and plan to provide personal protective equipment (PPE). Plan for Safe School Operations Reopening SY2020- 21 Spatial (Social) Distancing The safety of our teachers, staff, students, and their families is our number one priority when offering on-site learning. Individuals in the facility will maintain a distance of six feet of separation between each other and have not more than the maximum number of individuals in a single room or engaging in an outdoor activity as prescribed by the Phase Guidance provided by DC Health and the Mayor's office. During all phases, the school will limit non-essential visitors. The corresponding School Instruction Plan is created to support the Operations Plan. The school created a schedule that supports the maximum number of allowed students able to attend in-person. Traveling to and from School Students, families, and staff will be instructed to be aware of safety considerations during their travel to and from school, including using public transportation, individual cars, shared cars, and school-provided transportation services. Mundo Verde will not run our shuttle buses at this time and will evaluate restarting the program as the public health crisis improves Students, families, and staff who walk to school will be instructed to wear masks and practice measures for minimizing exposure on their commute with the following tactics where possible: Maintain six feet of distance between others on the sidewalk as much as possible avoiding most congested routes if an alternative route is reasonable and safe. Stand back from gathering points such as intersections, where reasonable and safe, to avoid congregating in large groups. Avoid touching unnecessary surfaces and objects. When surfaces and objects are touched, such as crosswalk buttons, use hand sanitizer with at least the recommended percent alcohol. Students, families, and staff who rely on public transportation to get to school will be instructed to wear masks and take proactive measures for minimizing exposure on their commute as described above. Students, families, and staff who are dropped off at school or who drive will be instructed to wear masks upon exiting the vehicle and to take proactive measures for minimizing exposure on their commute as described above. If families carpool with other families, masks should be worn in the car. Entering and Exiting School Building All students, families, and staff, will be provided instructions for entering and exiting the school. These are subject to change based on the status of the public health emergency and follow the overarching guidelines: Consult and train students, families, and staff on the details of the plan. Only students and staff will be allowed in the building during arrival and dismissals. External vendors will be extremely limited. Staggered arrival and dismissal times to reduce peak student traffic in and out. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 12 Multiple entry/exit points to avoid long lines and to keep students in assigned clusters. Provide health screening at each entry point. Provide fast track lanes for those who prescreen. Use multiple doors, each with a screening station, for entry and exit. Ensuring safety and security of all entry and exit points used. Mark direction lines and six foot separation standing spots on the exterior and post procedures for health screening check-point ahead. Correlate with the health screening section. Provide shelter accommodations to protect students during arrival and dismissals. Create safe outdoor lines related to safety and security threats. All arrivals and dismissals will occur outdoors regardless of weather conditions. Daily Health Screening Mundo Verde will require daily health screenings for students and staff or anyone entering the building. Students, families, and staff are advised and strongly encouraged to self-fill out the health screening prior to arrival to decrease wait times during arrival. Temperature checks will be required at this time. Knowing that all families may not have access to sterile thermometers, daily health screenings will ensure that no person entering the building has a fever. In the event a staff member must take a student's temperature, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends several procedures to do so safely. During temperature checks, Mundo Verde will use protective equipment (PPE) and non-contact thermometers. Mundo Verde will develop questions based on CDC and DC Public Health Guidelines. In the event anyone answers YES to experiencing systems listed on the screening, they should not report to the building that day. If a student arrives at the building and fails the health screening, there will be designated outside areas for them to stand if they need to speak to the school nurse or cool down from walking to retake the temperature check. They will not be permitted into the building again unless they are cleared by a medical professional, follow the re-entry guidelines listed later or can retake and pass the temperature check. PPE will be used during the health screenings. Prior to reporting to their post for health screenings, Mundo Verde will follow the CDC recommended sequences for PPE to the best of our ability. All PPE equipment for health screenings will be provided: Wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Put on PPE. This includes a face mask, eye protection (goggles or face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown may be considered if extensive contact with the individual being screened is anticipated. Ask and record health screening questions. Take the individual's temperature with non-touch thermometers. PPE and thermometers do not need to be sanitized or changed between usage if it is all non-contact. Upon finishing health screenings, wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Clean or discard PPE. OPTION 1: Barrier/partition controls Use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Put on disposable gloves. Stand behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition that can serve to protect the staff member's eyes, nose, and mouth from respiratory droplets if the person being screened sneezes, coughs, or talks. Make a visual inspection of the individual for signs of illness, which include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness. Check the temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window using no-touch Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 13 thermometers Always make sure your face stays behind the barrier during the temperature check. Changing gloves is not needed with our no-touch thermometers Use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol OPTION 2: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) PPE can be used if a temperature check cannot be performed by a parent/guardian (for a child), or an older student or staff member for him/herself or barrier/partition controls cannot be implemented. Use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Put on PPE. This includes a face mask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown may be considered if extensive contact with the individual being screened is anticipated. Changing gloves is not needed with our no-touch thermometers Remove and discard PPE. Use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Grouping (Clustering) Mundo Verde will take measures in its scheduling and planning to achieve the following grouping practices: We will group students and staff together each day (as opposed to mixing groups of teachers and students, where possible). We will not host any group activities or large gatherings of students, staff or community members, such as assemblies and indoor physical education classes when six feet of distance is not possible. For specials (music, art, P.E.) where students traditionally transition between classes, we will rotate teachers between classrooms, rather than students. We will correlate classroom groups with entry and exit points as well as coordinate use of hallways, restrooms, play spaces/outdoor space, and other shared spaces to avoid mixing groups. Groups of students will be determined using a combination of factors including grade level, success during distance learning, student IEPs or 504 plans, immunocompromised students, at-risk/FARM families, etc. In School Meals For our Cook Campus, we will continue to have our self-prep kitchen. Meals will be served individually plated. Calle Ocho Campus will have vended meals. These will be delivered in bulk and individually plated before service. There is also the option for pre-packaged lunches. Both our self-prep kitchen and vended meals will have safe meal preparation, service and cleaning plans. Students will continue to eat meals in the classroom. Meal distribution, eating, and waste collection will occur with six feet separation coordinated with one-way traffic arrows and queue lines marked on the floor of the classroom where possible. Additionally, Students will wash hands before and after eating, and may not share food, utensils, cups, or plates. Staff will wash hands before and after preparing food, and after helping children to eat. Tables and chairs will be cleaned and sanitized before and after the meal by the classroom teacher. At Calle Ocho, all meals and snacks will be delivered to classrooms. At Cook, all snacks will be delivered to classrooms. For lunches, PreK, K and 1st grade meals will be delivered to classrooms. 2nd-5th will come to the Zocalo on staggered schedules to pick up individually packaged meals, allow for spatial distancing, one-way traffic and sanitizing. In the event our Cook Campus kitchen staff need to quarantine due to a positive COVID-19 case, Cook campus in-person instruction may need to close for 24 hours depending on the time of notification for Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 14 quarantine. During the quarantine period, the Calle Ocho vendor will provide meals for Cook campus students. Foodservice staff must follow all PPE requirements in Appendix B, and as required per food safety regulation or requirements, including wearing gloves whenever handling food products and changing gloves and washing hands when changing activities. Routinely clean, sanitize, and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched such as kitchen countertops, cafeteria and service tables, door handles, carts, and trays. There are no food preparation booths or sampling of food and limited student contact. Grab and go meals that are not shelf stable must be placed in a refrigerator within two hours and stored under 41 degrees Fahrenheit. Foods should be reheated to 165 degrees Fahrenheit before consumption. Foods that are known as \"shelf-stable\" can be stored at room temperature for an extended period of time (e.g., cereal, graham crackers, raisins). All non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items. No food will be offered at events Students may bring lunches from home. Student's belongings such as lunches will be separated from others' and in individually labeled containers, cubbies, or areas. Students' 504 plans and Anaphylaxis Action Plans, including ensuring that students are not exposed to foods to which they are allergic, remains unchanged. Recess/Breaks The school will continue to hold recess and/or outside playtime, and will maintain physical distance between students outside, including staggering groups and dividing space outside as needed. There will not be more than one grouping of students in a designated outside area at one time. Cancelling, Eliminating Activities Mundo Verde will follow the guidance per DC Health depending on the phase that DC is in at the time. At this time, we will cancel, eliminate, or modify the program to adhere to the following: Cancel activities and events such as field trips, student assemblies, special performances, back to school nights and school-wide parent meetings. Suspend the service of Mundo Verde provided shuttles until the public health crisis has improved or it is financially feasible given the required procedures and reduced riderdership to maintain spatial distancing Eliminate non-essential travel for staff and teachers (e.g., conferences). Restrict the process for receiving mail and packages; only have necessary delivered and combine orders so fewer deliveries are made. Limit non-essential visitors (e.g., prohibit outside visitors from entering the school unless their presence was requested or if they received permission to enter the school). Preventing a Vaccine-Avoidable Outbreak Preventing the spread of COVID-19 is top of mind and has led to a decrease in vaccinations of students across the country, according to the CDC and DC Health officials. As a part of the student enrollment process, the enrollment team/registrar will confirm that all student vaccinations are up to date prior to fully enrolling a student. If it is determined that a student has been unable to get vaccines, the enrollment team will coordinate with the student support team and school nurse (if assigned) to support the student in getting an up-to-date screening. Students will not be allowed to start in-person learning without the proper vaccinations. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 15 Non-Medical Cloth Face-Coverings Non-medical cloth face-coverings will be considered part of the school uniform for staff and students. All school staff will wear cloth face coverings at all times when in the building, and when outside of the building when in close proximity to students and families. If an adult has a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a face covering, they must have documentation on file from a medical provider that they are not able to do so. We will work with all staff during onboarding to ensure that accommodations are met. Otherwise that individual should not participate in in-person school activities. All students and families will be required to wear cloth face coverings during arrival, dismissal, and at all times while moving around the school building and in the classrooms. PreK students will not need to wear a mask while sleeping during nap time. Face masks will not be required during outdoor physical activities when 6 feet of physical distancing can be maintained. If 6 feet of physical distance cannot be maintained outside, masks are required. Mundo Verde will provide staff with enough masks to cover the amount of days per week they are involved with in-person instruction. Staff may supplement or use their own masks as well. In certain cases, face shields or clear masks may be provided depending on the student needs. Disposable masks will be available in the event staff forget their reusable mask but will not be the default solution. Students will be provided with initial masks to cover the amount of days per week they are involved in in-person instruction. Additional masks will be made available for purchase or families may provide their own masks. Disposable or reusable masks will be available in the event students forget their reusable mask but will not be the default solution and families may be charged for additional reusable masks, similar to our existing uniform policy. While visitors to the school will be limited should a visitor or vendor need to enter they will wear a face covering on the school grounds and inside the school buildings at all times. Ensuring the safe use of clean cloth face coverings: Students and staff will bring multiple cloth face coverings with them. In the event that a student, staff, or guest does not have a face covering, one will be provided by the school. Staff and students will exercise caution when removing the covering, always storing it out of reach of other students, and wash hands immediately after removing it. If a student or staff member tampers with the face covering of another student or staff member, it should be removed immediately and replaced with a clean one. Staff, students and families will be trained on how to properly wear a mask. All staff and visitors (including contractors) must wear non-medical face coverings or face masks at all times while in the school building. If a staff member or visitor has a contraindication to wearing a face covering, either medical or otherwise, they should not participate in in-person school activities Students must also wear non-medical face coverings while in the school building, except in the event of a medical or developmental contraindication. If a student is unable to wear a mask throughout the day, mask breaks are acceptable at times in which physical (social) distance can be maintained (e.g., during snacks or meals). Families and educators should work with students to practice wearing a mask safely and consistently. Instances when face coverings do not need to or should not be worn: By children younger than 2 years of age; By anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone unconscious or unable to remove the mask without assistance; By children during naptime; When engaged in activities in which there is a risk of burn or injury from the use of a face covering\u2014such as chemistry labs with open flame; When participating in vigorous physical activity (e.g., recess) outdoors if social distancing of at least 6 feet is feasible. When outdoors but not participating in physical activity, face coverings must continue Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 16 to be worn; When actively drinking or eating a meal; Staff may wear face coverings with clear plastic windows, or briefly remove their face coverings, when interacting with students with disabilities identified as having hearing or vision impairments, who require clear speech or lip-reading to access instruction. Note: Face coverings or masks with exhalation valves or vents must NOT be worn in schools. This type of mask does not prevent the person wearing the mask from transmitting COVID-19 to others (source control). Hygiene Mundo Verde will prioritize personal (hand) and school-wide hygiene practices that prevent and contain the spread of disease, including COVID-19. We will work with our janitorial/custodial services provider and all onsite staff to ensure that the following environment will occur to maintain a healthy environment. A Health Screen occurs for all people entering the school. Health Screen materials are properly cleaned. Adequate supplies (e.g., soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer, tissue) are readily available in every bathroom and classroom throughout the day. All students will be provided with their own materials in designated and labeled bags or bins. All student belongings will be separated and stored in designated areas (e.g. locker, cubby, bin). Electronic devices (e.g. computers, smartphones, Chromebook) will be assigned to an individual. In the event that a student may need to borrow one (e.g. IT issue, forgot), the school will provide recently sanitized equipment. Increase air circulation only where safe and possible and ensure ventilation systems are operating properly. Encourage staff and students to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer. Install no-touch fixtures where possible (e.g., automatic faucets and toilets, touchless foot door openers, touchless trash cans, touchless hand sanitizer dispensers). Drinking fountains will not be used other than to refill individual bottles. Regular hand sanitizing will be enforced: Ensure handwashing strategies include washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, use an alcohol- based hand sanitizer that contains at least the recommended percent alcohol. (NOT METHANOL) Make hand cleaning supplies readily available in classrooms, bathrooms, and offices when possible. Set up sanitizing stations outside of large common spaces including the gymnasium, cafeteria, playgrounds or outdoor spaces, and entrances/exits. Students will wash or sanitize their hands when both entering and exiting a classroom or between activities. Enforce a \"you touch it, you take it\" policy in classrooms. High-Risk Individuals Students and staff at high-risk for contracting or experiencing severe illness due to COVID-19 will be cleared by their medical provider before participating in on-site activities. Consideration will also be made for live-in family members of students or staff at high-risk. Risk factors may include and are subject to change: Chronic Lung Disease Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 17 Moderate to Severe Asthma (see here for more information) Serious heart conditions Immunocompromised conditions Severe obesity (>40 Body Mass Index) Diabetes Chronic kidney disease, and/or Liver Disease People 65 years and older Any child, parent, or staff member who has a severe medical condition not on this list, but is still concerned about their safety. Medical documentation describing the risk from their medical provider must be shown to indicate their medical exclusion from participating in person Schools must notify all families and staff that DC Health recommends that any individual at increased risk for experiencing severe illness due to COVID-19 should consult with their medical provider before attending in- person activities at school. This includes, but is not limited to, people with: Cancer COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Serious heart conditions Immunocompromised state from a solid organ transplant Obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher) Sickle cell disease Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Chronic kidney disease Any student or staff member who has a medical condition not listed but who is concerned about their safety is recommended to consult with their healthcare provider before attending in-person activities. Schools are not required to secure written clearance from high-risk individuals prior to participating in in-person activities at school. Exclusion or Dismissal from On-Site Learning Exclusion Criteria: Mundo Verde will adhere to the exclusion and dismissal criteria. Students and staff must stay home, or not be admitted if: The student or staff member has had a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher any of the symptoms listed in the \"Daily Health Screening\", Any member of their household is confirmed to have COVID-19, or Any member of their household is awaiting COVID-19 test results.

Students or staff with pre-existing health conditions that present with specific COVID-19 - like symptoms may not be excluded from entering the school building on the basis of those specific symptoms, if previously evaluated by a health care provider and those specific symptoms determined to not be due to COVID-19. If excluded, students/parents/guardians and staff should call their healthcare provider for further directions. If a student or staff member reports any of the above symptoms or exposure during the daily health screening or otherwise, or is confirmed to have COVID-19, the student or staff member must not return to school until: 72 hours after the fever has resolved without the use of fever-reducing medication (e.g. Motrin, Tylenol) and respiratory symptoms have improved; AND at least 10 days after symptoms first appeared, whichever is later; OR per their healthcare provider following DC health instructions ; AND A note is provided to the school nurse and campus administration. Close Contact with a Person Who is Positive for Covid-19: If any student or staff member has been in close contact with a person who is positive for COVID-19, then the student or staff member must not enter the facility until cleared by their healthcare provider or have completed their quarantine period of 14 days from the last date of close contact with the COVID-19 positive individual without becoming symptomatic or diagnosed with COVID-19. Awaiting a COVID-19 Test Result If any student or staff member is awaiting a COVID-19 test result, then the student or staff member must not enter the facility until they test negative and meet standard criteria to return to school after an illness. If the student or staff member tests positive, then they should immediately begin a selfquarantine and seek further guidance from their healthcare provider or DC Health. Dismissal Criteria: If a student or staff member develops a fever or other signs of illness, the school must follow the above exclusion criteria regarding the exclusion and dismissal of students and staff. For students, the school is to immediately isolate the student from other students, the student must immediately put on a cloth (non-medical) or surgical face covering, if not wearing already, notify the student's parent/guardian of the symptoms and that the student needs to be picked up within 30 minutes, and immediately follow cleaning and disinfecting procedures for any area and materials with which the student was in contact. MV will identify a staff member to accompany the isolated student to the isolation area and supervise the student while awaiting pickup from the parent/guardian. The staff members briefly responding to the sick student in the classroom, accompanying the student to the isolation area and supervising the student in the isolation area must comply with PPE requirements For staff, the school is to send the staff member home immediately or isolate until it is safe to go home, seek healthcare provider guidance, and follow cleaning and disinfecting procedures for any area, materials, and equipment with which the staff member was in contact. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 19 Each classroom will be equipped with a no-contact thermometer for additional fever screenings through the day to limit the amount of students sent to the nurse. Students should only be sent to the nurse in extreme cases. Leave Policies Leave policies account for the following: Employees who report COVID-19 symptoms, Employees who were tested for COVID-19 and test results are pending, Employees who tested positive for COVID-19, Employees who are a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19, Employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members Exposure Reporting, Notification, and Disinfecting To ensure a clear and efficient process for communication, the school has identified Elle Carne as the primary point of contact (POC) and Robyn Pretlow as the internal COVID-19 POC. These persons are responsible for ensuring the below steps are followed in the event of a confirmed case of COVID-19. Failure of Health Screening, Absence Due To Sickness, Waiting on COVID-19 Test without Known Exposure Staff: Staff members who fail a health screening or report an absence due to sickness with symptoms aligning to COVID-19 must report this to their supervisor and Robyn Pretlow in HR, as well as submitting the sick leave into Purely HR. Staff may not return to work in-person until 72 hours after the fever has resolved without the use of fever-reducing medication (e.g. Motrin, Tylenol) and respiratory symptoms have improved; AND at least 10 days after symptoms first appeared, whichever is later; OR per their healthcare provider following DC health instructions AND note is provided to the school nurse and HR. If staff are waiting for the result of a COVID-19 test, they cannot return to in-person work until HR has received a note from their health care provider approving their return to work. They can continue job duties remotely if able. Staff members who are out sick or waiting for a COVID-19 test result will not require notification to the school community or quarantining of other staff members until a positive COVID-19 test result is known or if advised by the DC Department of Health. Staff privacy will be maintained at all times. Students: Students who fail a health screening or report an absence due to sickness with symptoms aligning to COVID-19, will follow the school's regular policy of being absent of a fever for 72 hours after the fever has resolved without the use of fever-reducing medication (e.g. Motrin, Tylenol) and respiratory symptoms have improved; AND at least 10 days after symptoms first appeared, whichever is later; OR per their healthcare provider following DC health instructions AND note is provided to the school nurse and school administration. Students may continue remote learning if able. Positive COVID-19 Test Result Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 20 Families must report a positive COVID-19 test result to Elle Carne at ecarne@mundoverdepcs.org as soon as the result is known. This will activate the school's COVID-19 response team that includes: Robyn Pretlow, HR Diana Rayas, Communications Campus Operations Manager Campus Principal Campus Nurse Step 1: Report to DC Health Department In the event a school identifies a student or staff member who has tested COVID-19 positive, Mundo Verde will notify DC Health by emailing coronavirus@dc.gov with the following information: \"COVID-19 Consult\" in the email subject line Name and direct phone number of the best point of contact for DC Health to return the call Short summary of incident/situation Mundo Verde expects per guidelines received that an investigator from DC Health will follow-up within 24 hours to all appropriately submitted email notifications. Decisions on the timeline of exclusion and any other responses to a COVID-19 exposure will be determined by DC Health. Step 2: Communication to Families and Staff Mundo Verde will have communication protocols in place that protect the privacy of individuals and alert their families and staff to a COVID-19 case. Communication will be completed, per DC Health directive and will include: Notification to those staff and families of students in close contact with the individual, including the requirement to quarantine for 14 days; Notification to the entire school that there was a COVID-19 positive case, those impacted have been told to quarantine, steps that will be taken (e.g., cleaning and disinfection); Education about COVID-19, including the signs and symptoms at coronavirus.dc.gov; Referral to the Guidance for Contacts of a Person Confirmed to have COVID-19, available at coronavirus.dc.gov; and Information on options for COVID-19 testing in the District of Columbia, available at coronavirus.dc.gov/testing. Mundo Verde will await further DC Health instructions on dismissals and other safety precautions in the event a known COVID19 individual came in close contact with others at school. Step 3: Cleaning, Sanitization, and Disinfection of Affected Spaces In the event of a confirmed COVID-19 case in a student or staff member, the school must follow all steps outlined by DC Health as well as the cleaning, disinfection and sanitization guidance from the CDC below: If seven days or fewer have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, Mundo Verde will follow these steps: 1) Close off areas used by the person who is sick. 2) Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the areas. 3) Wait up to 24 hours or as long as possible before cleaning or disinfecting to allow respiratory droplets to settle. 4) Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as classrooms, bathrooms, and common areas. If more than seven days have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, Mundo Verde understands that additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. We will continue routine cleaning and disinfection. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 21 Instructional Delivery Plan[NOTE - NEW CHARTS BELOW] 5.Describe how the LEA will deliver instruction in order to achievecontinuous learning during the 2020-21 school year. Identify the instructional methods(e.g., 100 percent synchronous instruction, student-guided instruction, etc.),and platforms (e.g., the product name if using a learning management system (LMS)),and materials Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 22 Student and Staff Schedule A detailed model schedule for students and staff is included in the Instruction Delivery Plan. Distributing Education Materials and Supplies If required by a student's IEP or 504 plan, all materials will be sanitized prior to assigning to a student for the duration of its use. For students learning remotely, the materials will be available to the student during designated times for pick up at the school. In special cases for families who are unable to travel to school, the materials will be dropped off or mailed to the student's resident. The student and family will sign an Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 23 agreement to take care of the materials and follow school behavior policy. School materials that will be used by others will be returned by the student following completion of the unit-of-study. The same process will be repeated for checking in materials. Instructional teams will lead specific groups, limiting the need to share materials. In the event that materials are shared between multiple groups or individuals, a thorough sanitation process will take place between users. Mundo Verde's distance learning model does not require mass distribution of paper packets. However, there may be some students that require packets for their personalized plan. Paper packets will follow the below process: Supply pick up and paper packet pick up will happen once in August, once in September and once in October. This will be adjusted as needed during remote learning. Lesson plans and printed materials will be made available for pick up at the student's campus either on the last day of in-person instruction for the week or on Wednesdays if the student is in full remote learning. Teachers will provide the printed packet for at least 4 weeks of lessons if the student is in full remote learning to minimize the frequency of pick ups. Front desk staff will assist with printing as needed and manage pick up of Wednesday materials as needed. The need for distribution of school supplies outside of paper packets for full remote learning will be evaluated by instruction staff and coordinated with chromebook pick-ups at each campus. Below is a list of items assigned to each student for in-person learning. This list will be refined by instructional and operations staff depending on the grade: All classes: Chromebook, hotspot, pack of 10 no.2 pencils, a box of crayons, colored pencils, etc. Reading books for independent, group, or class reading, notebook, etc. Distribution will happen outside when possible, otherwise all building entry protocols must be followed including health screenings. Before and After School Programming (Extended Day) Before and after school programming is provided by Mundo Verde staff. Any such programming when offered will follow all the same procedures outlined in this document. We will attempt to reduce the amount of overlap as much as possible. In accordance with OSSE guidelines, groupings for before and after care students may vary slightly from day-time in-person student groupings. Meals During Remote Learning Mundo Verde will offer breakfast and lunch through the NSLP program during remote learning. Families will pre-order meals and fill out FARM forms through our SIS, Infinite Campus. Meal pickups are 3-6 pm on Tuesdays & Fridays at each campus and will take place outdoors with social distancing in place. Dates and times will be adjusted as needed. If families are unable to come to school, we will provide touchless delivery options to their homes. Per updated USDA guidelines, families also have the option to visit open meal sites throughout the city. (e.g., textbooks, teacher-generated resources, computer software, etc.) your schools will use during the Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 24 PPE Requirements for Staff School staff must adhere to the guidance below at a minimum. These guidelines do not replace professional judgment, which must always be used to ensure the safest environment for staff and students. Note: Staff and children must practice good hand hygiene throughout all of the scenarios and maintain physical distance of six feet to the maximum extent feasible. Wearing gloves is not a substitute for good hand hygiene. Gloves must be changed between children and care activities, and hand hygiene must be performed between glove changes. If skin comes into contact with any secretions or bodily fluids, it must be immediately washed. Contaminated clothing must be immediately removed and changed. WORKING WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT KNOWN OR NOT SUSPECTED TO HAVE COVID-19 Lower Risk*: 6 feet of physical distance cannot always be maintained. Close contact with secretions or bodily fluids is not anticipated. Non-medical (cloth) face covering Medium Risk**: Staff are in close/direct contact with less than 6 feet of physical distance. Close contact with secretions or bodily fluids is possible or anticipated. Non-medical (cloth) face covering If potential for bodily fluids to be splashed or sprayed (e.g., student who is spitting, coughing; while providing a nebulized medication), instead use surgical mask and eye protection (face shield or goggles) Coverall Gloves must be used per existing procedures (e.g., when diapering, administering medication) Higher Risk***: School nurses who are engaged in aerosol-generating procedures**** must follow additional guidance for Healthcare Providers per DC Health and provide their own PPE. *Scenarios that would be classified as \"lower risk\" include situations where school staff may be within six feet of students who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 and in which the students are not consistently wearing their face coverings. This includes services by related service providers in which close contact with secretions is not anticipated. This also includes scenarios in which staff administering the Daily Health Screening are wearing a face covering, maintain 6 feet of physical distance and are not performing a physical temperature check. **Scenarios that would be classified as \"medium risk\" include close contact between a student and a related service provider, paraprofessional and/or dedicated aide in which close contact with secretions or bodily fluids is possible or anticipated. This also includes personal care (e.g., diapering) and oral medication administration. For nebulized medication administration, must wear surgical mask and eye protection, as per criteria for \"if potential for bodily fluids to be splashed or sprayed.\" ***Scenarios that would be classified as \"higher risk\" include when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, aerosol-generating procedures include open suctioning of airways, sputum induction, CPAP), bronchoscopy, and manual ventilation. 2020-21 school year to ensure rigor across settings; Explain the total instructional hours per day for the typical student participating in your distance learning program. Provide a breakdown of anticipated hours spent in a synchronous learning environment (learning that happens in real time with the student and teacher together) and asynchronous learningenvironment (independent learning that takes place without real-time input from the teacher); Describe the training and professional development for school staff to support the effective implementation of this instructional plan; and Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 25 Below you will find a summary of how Mundo Verde will deliver instruction in order to achieve continuous learning during SY 2020-21. After much deliberation and with significant feedback from our families and staff, Mundo Verde PCS will launch the 2020-2021 school year on Monday, August 31, 2020 with a remote-only instructional model for all students. School leadership has made the difficult decision to launch the year in remote learning in order to prioritize the health and safety of students, families and staff; deeply focusing school resources on supporting the learning and work needs of students, families and staff; and ensuring that we are prepared to open later this fall with tested COVID-19 protocols for safety and learning in place. In developing this plan, school leaders placed particular importance on the feedback received from families and staff and have worked to align the approach with the plans emerging from our city. With lessons learned from the spring, Mundo Verde is redesigning our instructional program and developing strategies specifically to reach those students who struggled to participate in remote learning this past spring, as well as to address the particular challenge when implementing remote bilingual and inquiry-based early childhood education in a remote setting. Below you will find a summary of the i nstructional m ethods, platforms and materials Mundo Verde will use to ensure rigor across learning settings. In this plan, Mundo Verde will follow the guidance from the Deputy Mayor for Education and the Department of Health regarding scheduling and options for students: We will implement to the best of our ability an A/B schedule to facilitate coordination between Mundo Verde and other schools and sectors. Mundo Verde schedule once we are transitioned back to onsite learning will include a group of students attending school in-person on Mondays and Tuesdays and another group attending school in-person on Thursdays and Fridays. For in-person learning, we will following the following Pre-Opening G uidance for the maximum occupants per classroom: Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 School staff/students will comply with DC Health Guidance (including processing confirmed cases in the school). We understand and will be prepared to support the learning of students in multiple settings, once we have shifted from full remote learning to having some students onsite students learning physically on-site (daily or a few days/week, depending on factors) Students unable to learn on-site (e.g., immunocompromised students). Certain students will choose not to come to school due to health/safety concerns. Instructional Delivery Model and Methods Below you will find a decription of how Mundo Verde PCS will meet its mission, goals, and student academic achievement expectations as set forth in its charter agreement as well as provide optimal learning opportunities in a virtual learning setting through synchronous and asynchronous remote and on-site learning opportunities to achieve continuous learning during SY2020-21. Our plan centers on equity, ensuring that all students, including students who are at risk, per the city's definition, English learners, and/or with disabilities, are able to access all learning opportunities without further compromising their health and social-emotional well-being. The plan may change throughout the school year based on factors, such as family and staff responses to surveys and DC's reopening guidance, dictating how decisions to move from remote to on-site should be included. The following options are available to families enrolling in Mundo Verde PCS for school year 2020-21, until the District of Columbia is determined to be in Phase 4. Phase 4 will mean that the CDC and DC government Describe the manner in which the LEA will ensure the plan is routinely monitored and adjusted, as needed, to address the needs of every student in the LEA across learning environments. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 26 Assessment and Promotion Policy A. Assessmenthas determined that a credible vaccine or cure is available, at which point we will be delighted to open school to all students! Quarter 1: Fully Virtual Learning: Combination Synchronous & Asynchronous (All Groups) Mundo Verde Bilingual Public Charter School has determined that all students will begin the first nine weeks with synchronous and asynchronous learning options. Students will experience learning from home four days a week via synchronous learning and one day a week with asynchronous learning. Families will have the option of at least three synchronous sessions daily, four days a week. Live main lessons will be recorded to offer asynchronous learning options to meet our families scheduling needs. Corresponding lesson materials will be available for synchronous and asynchronous lessons. Additional opportunities for engagement will be offered through virtual inquiry-based learning experiences. Quarter 2: Hybrid Rotating On-Site / Virtual Learning Settings At the beginning of the second quarter, we plan to transition students back to school in a hybrid model with a rotating schedule - in which some students will learn physically onsite on some days and other days will learn in remote settings. Students will be strategically placed in groups based on data, instructional needs, family circumstances, and in accordance to safety guidelines. We are aiming to prioritize in person learning for our youngest students, students with disabilities, and students that have not been successful in the remote learning model. The image below shows the schedule. Group A/B and C/D/E/F: For in-person learning, in-school A/B represents early childhood or students who need more time onsite. and C-F represents students in grades 2-5. Families may choose to change their schedule on an as-needed basis through direct communication with the school. The school will accommodate all families at the start of each quarter and adjust as best as possible throughout each quarter. Families will be given the opportunity to tell us their preference in advance of quarter 2 [do we want to describe what tool families will use to inform us of their preferences. Preferences for quarter 2 will affect capacity. Younger and at risk students will be prioritized. Families will have the opportunity to alter preferences on a quarterly basis. Virtual Synchronous (Group V): This option is for students who are immune compromised or who have a family member who is immune compromised or whose family would prefer that the child not attend school in-person. In this option, the students may experience learning from home four days a week via synchronous learning and one day a week with asynchronous learning. The learning may not require the student to be logged onto the computer but rather engaging in activities at the same time as their peers on-site. Virtual Asynchronous (Group V): For students who are unable to attend synchronous learning when remote. This type of learning allows for weekend learning, when families may be more able to support students. Students will be able to access content teachers for pre-determined and communicated office hours throughout the school week.

Youngest learners will be prioritized for touch screen chromebooks, simulating easy access features of a tablet. All students will have access to Firefly, Mundo Verde's newly launched centralized LMS. The platform provides several benefits to families and teachers especially in the way of increased access in the coming year. It ensures that: Families can access the learning of all their children attending Mundo Verde in one place Students of all ages, including very young children can access and navigate the platform with ease Controls over media links are maintained and recommendation settings prevent distractions and/ or introduction to undesired media Students or families can access the platform in E nglish or Spanish with a reader for either language. Firefly integrates several tools teachers used in the Spring successfully which they will continue to us ( See Technology Policy for a comprehensive list of platforms ). Firefly also allows teachers to better organize project based and inquiry based learning in two languages- a foundational priority for our EL school focused on dual immersion and sustainability. Firefly houses units of instruction as well as personalized pathways for learning for every student, allowing for greater rigor in the quality of both teacher and student products to this end. In this way, teachers can take expeditionary learning online in a fluid and meaningful way. Total Daily Instructional Hours With the exception of prekindergarten, students participating in Mundo Verde's distance learning program will have 6 hours of synchronous and asynchronous programming each day/ four days a week, with release time for teachers on Wednesday when students have independent instructional activities. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 28 Students are expected to participate fully in synchronous programming. If the family's schedule does not afford the opportunity for synchronous learning, all lessons will be recorded for asynchronous use. Instructional methods at Mundo Verde Bilingual Public Charter School will be planned to meet the needs of family and staff regardless of whether the student is experiencing instruction virtually or in-person. This will allow for uninterrupted learning for students when health and safety guidance changes (such as moving from Phase II to Phase III) or when the school facility is closed to staff and students due to an acute outbreak or citywide declaration. See Virtual Learning Schedule Mundo Verde will be able to implement this robust schedule for students, along with sufficient planning for teachers by leveraging the role that specials teachers play in a modified schedule from pre-COVID. Across the Mundo Verde Bilingual Public Charter School, we have 11 specialists assigned to 44 classrooms (945 students). Each specialist provides their specific special class - art, music, movement, physical education, cooking, gardening - on a rotating basis during a specific block of time during the day. This approach to the schedule provides lead teachers and fellows teachers a lunch break and planning time while maintaining sychronous progrmming for students. During virtual learning, the specialist will collaborate with teachers and administration to support the students showing severe or persistent signs of disengagement, help trouble-shoot engagement issues (IT, wrap around services, content), and triage support for the student as needed. Training and Professional Development for School Staff To support the effective implementation of this instructional plan, Mundo Verde will build on and adapt its already robust approach to staff development. Professional Development at Mundo Verde Bilingual Public Charter School is a strong driver towards the accomplishment of our vision. Through a systematic structure of engagement opportunities (including external PD, ILT, Curriculum and Data Meetings, Wednesdays PD, coaching), PD builds a shared understanding and capacity around our mission to impact equitable outcomes for children. Through the following structures of professional development and support, staff gain access to brand-new or recurring implementation priorities and content that drives our innovation and work plan goals for the year, while deepening our school-wide culture: New Staff In-Service Training August 3-7: During this time, new hires and staff new to their role, will onboard through the Mundo Verde New Staff Professional Development Institute. In this 5 day institute, new staff members will gain insights of the culture, instruction and organizational tenets of Mundo Verde, building background 101 knowledge for new staff on content that any other returning staff member can speak about at length. This institute emphasizes our approach to curriculum and instruction for instructional and non-instructional staff members. All Staff In-Service Training August 10-28: During this time, all staff will receive training on core platforms for implementation of virtual learning (including Firefly, Zoom, Google suite), student information systems (Infinite Campus), structures for family engagement, professional responsibilities, criteria and expectations for teaching and learning, monitoring and communicating student progress, social emotional learning, and other key areas of work. Facilitation of summer professional development is shared by instructional leaders, facilitators from partner organizations, and appropriate staff (Operations, HR, Data, etc.) in order to ensure all staff are able to be successful throughout SY20-21. Much of the summer professional development will be targeted at instructional staff with a focus on content delivery, personalized learning, community and relationship building, and meeting the needs of all learners. Throughout August professional development, we aim to develop a robust understanding of where we've been and where we are headed as an organization: implementation priorities, work plan goals for the year and individual goals for staff. Wednesdays Year Round: In addition, all staff will receive professional development on Wednesdays throughout the year. The professional development will focus on assessing student learning, troubleshooting IT issues, engagement, and building community when remote. Staff will also receive extensive training on health guidelines and safety protocols prior to entering the buildings. Healthy and Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 29 safety procedures, as well as required training, such as mandated reporting, are covered during ongoing professional development. The scope and sequence of the Wednesday professional development calendar directly aligns with our instructional vision and model and is flexible to be responsive to data and feedback. Teachers will also support one another and actively collaborate on Wednesdays around curriculum content, and lesson planning. On Wednesdays, both teacher and community leaders facilitate and participate in professional development and are given time to collaborate and develop intervention support plans for students who show signs of disengagement. Every day, the lead teacher will have time built into the instructional day for collaborative planning - to work with intervention and special education providers/coordinators. Coaching Year Round: Additionally, instructional coaching at Mundo Verde Bilingual Public Charter School increases the achievement and engagement of every student by bringing out the best performance of every teacher. Using both student-centered and teacher-centered methods, coaches help teachers improve the decisions they make about their instruction. Instructional coaching is aligned to each teacher's individual goal derived from the teacher performance areas of growth. Instructional coaching is a professional responsibility for lead teachers and takes place at least once a year. Each coaching cycle lasts for approximately 6 weeks. Coaching cycles may be individualized or facilitated in grade level or cohort teams. Additional Support: Each day, teachers and community leaders will have access to the IT department, behavioral support specialist, support staff, department, data department, and grade leads, and other instructional staff to troubleshoot issues that occur both on-site and remote. Teachers will have access to individualized office hours as needed to help meet their professional needs and capacity to deliver on the intended outcomes of our program. During PD sessions, our staff accomplishes the following: Continue building school-wide relational trust; experience joy through celebrations and community initiatives Engage in cycles of professional learning (data review, new learning, planning, implementation and debrief) that result in the accomplishment of our Work Plan goals and implementation priorities Collaborate across departments/ teams to improve equitable student outcomes Develop background knowledge, strategies and actions to improve approaches to equity, anti-racism, and trauma informed practices Plan for big instructional events throughout the year (conferences, Grading, Expedition launch, Celebrations of Learning, etc.) Participate in school-wide feedback protocols to support Work Plan goals and priorities (data analysis, Implementation Review, High-quality work protocols, etc.) Fulfill compliance towards mandated trainings (professional responsibilities, emergency procedures, mandated reporting) Monitoring and Adjustments Mundo Verde will ensure the plan is routinely monitored and adjusted, as needed, to address the needs of every student in the LEA across learning environments. School leaders will monitor the success of the program as follows: Principals conduct a cycle of mini-walkthrough observations conducted for every teacher monthly resulting in at least 8 min observations for each teacher during the school year. Feedback is shared immediately with teachers via Bullseye aligned to Danielson's Rubric for Teaching. While the approach will be modified in terms of techniques to support the observation of teachers in remote settings, the level of supervision of instruction in remote settings will be the same as that required during a regular school year in which teachers are instructing onsite at school. Grade/ Class Based Data Analysis Meetings are conducted weekly/ biweekly (depending on the size of the team) in order to view student outcome data as evidence of success and to make adjustments to programming, intervention and student/ family support as needed. Principals will conduct weekly (PK/ K/ 5) and biweekly Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 30 data meetings with grade level teams on formative and summative assessment data. Future professional development will be planned based on the results of the analysis. If it is determined that some instructional strategies are more (or less) effective than others, these will be replicated, replacing the less effective strategies. Once a month, students, who have shown the least engagement whether by attendance or work product, will be evaluated through grade level team meetings. The team will determine the potential cause of disengagement, from equipment or Wifi issues, to mental health to difficulties with content. Depending on the results, the student may be provided resources to increase access or asked to change their schedule for engagement. All students will take DESSA, a social emotional learning assessment three times per year. Based on the results, modifications will be made to the learning plan for cohorts or individual students. Weekly meetings with the Instructional Leadership Team (ILT), a team of teacher leaders and school leaders who regularly meet to analyze school-wide qualitative and quantitative outcome data in order to make adjustments to programming, professional development and teacher support as needed. Weekly meetings of the Network Leadership Team representing the supervisors of all school departments focused on ensuring the efficient and timely implementation of the school's plan. Weekly meetings of the Senior Leadership Team, also functioning as the COVID Response Team, which includes the Executive Director, the Chief Schools Officer, the Director of Operations, and the Network Coordinator to progress monitor the impact of the school especially as it relates to high level compliance and performance. Overview of Assessments The language in this section describes the formative assessments that Mundo Verde will use to assess student learning during the 2020-2021 school year, along with the how will will administer them. Results of all assessments will be shared with the student and parent/guardian and used to inform interventions and student grades. In the section, we describe Mundo Verde's commitment to assessing and learning. The language provided in this submission policy supports Mundo Verde's charter and does not replace the commitments set forth in the charter goals or business rules for measuring goal attainment. The policy describes the formative assessments the school is considering administering for all students by grade bands, and for students who participate exclusively in remote learning, when each assessment will be administered, and the manner in which the LEA will provide academic intervention and support across both learning environments - in person and distance. Commitment to Assessment Integrity: In order to ensure to the best of our ability that our assessments are valid, reliable and measuring student learning, all families will sign testing integrity agreements that include the parameters in which families, classmates, and others may help students on assessments and how the Internet and other resources may be used during assessments. Formative Assessments: Adaptations, Implementation, and Timing BOY=Beginning of Year MOY = Mid YearHow the LEA will plan to assess students who either do not attend school regularly in person, or who participate exclusively in distance learning. Describe the specific modalities you plan to use to ensure every student is assessed (e.g., at-home diagnostic assessments, online proctoring, physically in the building). Describe if modalities differ by grade bands; and When the LEA intends to administer these assessments during the school year, specifying for each assessment.

Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 32 B. Promotion and Graduationhybrid model Grading Policy Mundo Verde is maintaining its current grading policy with some flexibility for the context of distance learning. Mundo Verde currently uses summative assessments to grade students on the standards covered during a unit of study. In the context of distance learning, our instructional staff will have the flexibility to use other sources of grading such as exit tickets, specific tasks, and other work produced by students independently in order to report on the standards covered in the unit of study. Students are scored on a scale of 1-4 applied to each specific standard. Promotion Policy Mundo Verde's current policy is to promote students who have mastered grade level expectations and are equipped with the skills necessary to make meaningful progress as he/she advances to the next grade. In light of the public health emergency and transition to distance learning, no student, regardless of their status related to meeting grade level standards for learning at the time of our closure will be retained. Per existing policy, Mundo Verde will not accept family recommendations for promotion or retention, and we will not use retention as a way of remediating or accelerating academic achievement. Special consideration may be given to students who would have qualified for retention under the school's attendance policy prior to our Public Health Response closure will be recommended for retention next school year. NA - Mundo Verde is not a high school. Option A: The LEA is using a learning management system (LMS) for distance learning. How is the student's presence authenticated daily using the LMS? What constitutes sufficient engagement in the LMS for the student to be marked present? Following OSSE's guidance on the collection of student attendance for SY 2020-21 Mundo Verde Bilingual 7.Describe if/how student grading and promotion policies will be altered in light of distance learning. If the LEA is not changing its grading and promotion policy to accommodate distance learning, the LEA may provide a link to the policy or describe the existing policy. 8.Public Charter High Schools Only: If a high school in your charter LEA has any school specific graduation requirements (i.e., courses, projects, or presentations) that exceed the requirements in 5-A DCMR \u00a72203 and are outlined in your school's charter that you plan to waive for SY 2020-21, describe those waived requirements. 9.OSSE has issued guidance on the collection of student attendance for SY 2020-21. Describe the LEA's policy for student attendance through distance learning. In your response, be sure to identify whether the LEA is using Option A and/or Option B. The LEA should respond to the questions associated with each response. In crafting your response, note the following: Schools are expected to implement their normal, in-person attendance policies and procedures when students are on school grounds LEAs that serve students that are not compulsory age (pre-K 3, pre-K 4, and Adult) are not required to abide by the above attendance policy. However, they should describe their attendance expectations and policies for students. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 33 PCS will take specific steps to track, record and report student attendance. Mundo Verde will be using BOTH Option A and B to authenticate participation in learning. Although Mundo Verde is using an LMS for distance learning, we are reserving the right to use personal contact and other evidence as supplemental means for collecting proof of attendance. This is particularly important for very young children and other children who may face obstacles in accessing the LMS on a daily basis. Therefore, Mundo Verde is checking both option A and B - we will be using an LMS to monitor student participation and attendance, as well as other means including 1-1, small group, and whole group live sessions. Teachers are responsible for documenting daily student attendance/participation in remote learning with the protocol outlined before. During Virtual Learning the following steps will allow for the application of Option A and/ or B as necessary given the nature of a student's participation in distance learning. Mundo Verde will implement its normal, in-person attendance policies and procedures when students are on school grounds. Attendance-Taking Protocol At the end of each day, the teacher will take attendance based on the participation of students in live sessions and work in the LMS. If a student is marked absent in the previous step, the teacher will perform a weekly check for the engagement submitted through the LMS. Based on the degree of engagement, the teacher will modify the attendance records for the student. 1) Virtual / Live Touchpoints: The teacher will mark the student present if the student participates in any of the virtual/ live touchpoints below Crew Session Live Instruction/Literacy Workshop Live Instruction/Math Workshop Small group sessions Personalized Learning Sessions Read Aloud sessions Specials sessions Spanish Club 2) LMS Engagement: Student shows engagement with the day's material located in the LMS. All students who are learning remotely will receive a notification through the LMS with a list of the day's assignments and expectations. Any of the following cases can be considered sufficient \"engagement\" for a present mark: The student submits most/all of the work for the instructional day in a way that the teacher considers to be thoughtful engagement. The student does not submit most/all of the work for the instructional day, but the teacher has sufficient evidence of thoughtful engagement with the content through questions posted by the student, thoughtful engagement witnessed by the teacher in a live session, or clear evidence in the student LMS account of significant revision/editing/drafting of responses. The reporting of attendance will take place through the Student Information System as a two part process. Absence Protocol Mundo Verde Bilingual PCS will take the following actions to address absences: Teachers will contact absent students and families by email and/or phone to determine reason for absence and determine what's needed to ensure future attendance. The registrar trackz students with multiple absense and flagz them for additional follow up from administrators including the student support team. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 34 Mundo Verde PCS will follow all procedures concerning chronic attendance in accordance with the law. Families of students who are learning remotely will receive the following: An email and text every morning if the attendance record for the previous day was \"absent\". Follow-up from student services when 5 unexcused absences have been reached to prepare an attendance improvement plan. Protocols for Students of Non-Compulsory Age Although Mundo Verde serves students that are not in compulsory age (Pre-K 3, Pre-K 4) the school policy will be reinforced in terms of tracking and supports with all families given our school's commitment to data and research that shows a strong correlation between consistent attendance and strong academic and performance outcomes in future schooling. However, for students in this age group, the school will not file referrals to CFSA for academic negligence or conduct meetings after the 5th unexcused absence. Option B: The LEA is not using a learning management system (LMS) for distance learning. What is the complete listing of acceptable methods for making one-on-one contact with the student authenticate a student's presence? What is the procedure the LEA will use to make one-on-one contact with the student to authenticate a student's presence? What constitutes evidence of education engagement daily for the student to be marked present? Although Mundo Verde is using an LMS for distance learning, we are reserving the right to use personal contact and other evidence as supplemental means for collecting proof of attendance.

However, for students in this age group, the school will not file referrals to CFSA for academic negligence or conduct meetings after the 5th unexcused absence. All LEA attendance records will be maintained in the student information system. School administrators will schedule periodic checks with teachers on attendance recording to ensure school policy is being followed. All student work will be stored in the LMS organized by date of instruction. In the event of an attendance audit, Mundo Verde will be able to provide student work corresponding to each school day to serve as support for the student attendance record. This will include exit tickets, class activities, and long term projects housed in the LMS. 10.How will the LEA collect, verify, enter, and store supporting data (based on its selection[s] above) to ensure that the official attendance records of students are accurate? What student-level data specifically would be furnished to OSSE in the event of an audit of attendance records? Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 36 Whole Student Support A. Student Support Mundo Verde's approach to supporting students' social-emotional and mental health needs during continuous learning and school recovery include an integrated focus on social emotional standards alongside academic standards and the identification of students requiring additional supports through personalized learning and Response to Intervention (RTI). In this way, the LEA will identify and provide academic intervention to students who have lost the most learning due to COVID-19. According to the American Academy of Pediatricians, \"Remote learning is likely to result in severe learning loss and increased social isolation. Social isolation, in turn, can breed serious social, emotional and health issues: child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, these impacts will be visited more severely on Black and brown children, as well as low-income children and those with learning disabilities.\" Below are several interventions Mundo Verde will implement to support students' social-emotional and mental health needs during continuous learning and school recovery. Teachers will embed social-emotional and wellness checks within daily asynchronous and synchronous classroom lessons. Teachers and community leaders will conference with families and if necessary, refer students to the mental health team for students displaying needs for support. The mental health team will provide weekly, optional, asynchronous videos and lessons for students available through the LMS. School administration will model social-emotional and wellness checks during teacher professional learning time that can be used in the classroom and to support the social-emotional and wellness needs of classroom teachers. The mental health team will create tele-health options for students to call and schedule sessions with school counselors. The mental health team will make referrals to neighborhood Family and Support Collaboratives for families in need of additional social-emotional and mental health support. Timely Intervention: Personalized Learning and Response to Intervention Personalized Learning Mundo Verde will ensure timely intervention by developing and implementing personalized learning plans for all students. Personalized learning plans will be updated formally three-times based on data analysis from essential assessments and self reflection sessions with students and families as needed. The Process Personalized learning plans will be initiated at the beginning of the year for all students after universal assessment data are analyzed and used to develop these plans. Plans will continue throughout the year with continuous progress monitoring, periodic evaluations, and BOY, MOY, EOY check-ins. Criteria for Success11.Describe the LEA's plan for supporting students' social-emotional and mental health needs during continuous learning and school recovery. Also describe how, during your planning, the LEA will identify and provide academic intervention to students who have lost the most learning due to COVID-19. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 37 Students It guides students in setting achievable goals Is based on their self-recognized strengths, growth areas, interests, and career aspirations. Includes a place for students to list their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and career aspirations Includes a place for them to list their short- and long-term academic goals Includes a place for the student and teacher to list the action steps needed to reach those goals Teachers It includes teacher identification of strengths, growth areas, and strategies the student can use to achieve goals. It includes qualitative and quantitative data and evidence to inform strengths, and growth areas. Purpose Allows students to think through and have a say in their educational process Motivates students to take responsibility for their learning Motivates students to invest their time and energy in the process Removes the burden of having one definition of success for all students Bases success upon the individually met goals of each student. Personalization involves a teacher's Relationships with students and their families, Use of multiple instructional modes to scaffold each student's learning, Enhancement of the student's personal competencies, Variation of the time, place, and pace of learning for each student, Enlistment of the student in the creation of learning pathways, and Use of technology to manage and document the learning process and access rich sources of information Response to Intervention (RTI) RTI is used by Mundo Verde as an effective process for accelerating learning for all students. RTI is a multi- tier approach to the early identification and support of students with learning and/or behavioral challenges. The Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA 2004) supports schools in their implementation of this approach to prevent and address such challenges that affect students' overall educational performance. The IDEA also allows RTI to be used as an alternative to the traditional discrepancy model in identifying that a student has a specific learning disability. RTI is the method by which Mundo Verde ensures early identification and intervention of educational disabilities and improves educational outcomes for students struggling with academics and/or behavior. A model is used which incorporates the following principles into RTI process and practices: Universal screening Implementation of core curriculum content Universal Design of Instruction Differentiation of Instruction Use of research/evidence-based interventions Continuous monitoring of student performance and progress Use of data to measure levels of student achievement; target students' specific skill deficits; ascertain the effectiveness of interventions; and drive future decision making Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 38 B. BehaviorUse of collaborative problem solving to analyze data and to appropriately support students' academic and/or behavioral needs Although students are traditionally referred to RTI after the first six weeks of the school year, given the impact of COVID on a majority of students, both academically as well as in terms of mental health and wellness, Mundo Verde will take an inverted approach to RTI, prioritizing the individualized needs of students at the top of the year (Tier 2/3) in order to inform Tier 1 teaching in the fall and spring. Students and families will attend reentry meetings at the beginning of the school year during which academic and SEL data and evidence will be shared in order to formulate a personalized education plan for each student. Plans will be monitored and as additional data and evidence of progress become available, student plans will be revised and updated to reflect new goals and expectations. Mundo Verde will, however, use the determinations of the Student Support Team made at the final meetings of the 2019-20 school year, for every student that participated in the RTI process. Any student who was not dismissed from RTI at the end of the school year will continue with their RTI plan at the beginning of SY20-21. Additionally, under Mundo Verde's existing protocol, students referred for evaluation for special education and related services will continue to receive RTI services and supports until such time as eligibility under the IDEA is determined, an IEP is developed, and parents give informed written consent for implementation of an initial IEP. These are students who experienced academic and/or social/emotional/behavioral challenges prior to school closure resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. After 1st quarter, Student Services will begin accepting RTI referrals and will evaluate each referral on a case-by-case basis. Factors under consideration will include: student levels prior to March 13, 2020 COVID- 19 closure, student performance data and participation during distance learning March-June 2020, data from the implementation of the Personalized Learning Plans, and student performance data and participation during Virtual Learning from August-November 2020. This will have given parents sufficient time to get feedback from their child and their child's teachers following COVID closures, and it will give teachers sufficient time to get to know their students' strengths and needs in a virtual context; establish, teach, and practice classroom norms and procedures; assess students using Mundo Verde's universal screening instruments; and implement the principles of Universal Design for Learning and Differentiated Instruction. Teachers should present potential RTI referrals to Grade Level Teams (GLTs) for review of pre-referral strategies, supports, and interventions, and corresponding data. After vetting and further implementation of collaborative problem solving, as appropriate, RTI referrals can be submitted to the Inclusion Manager using the referral form. Referrals to RTI will be documented in the school database and on a spreadsheet maintained annually by the Inclusion Manager. Referrals will be accepted until February 1st, in order to ensure students can move through the tiers of support before the school year ends. Determinations arising from participation in the RTI process that relate to referral for retention in grade, referral for evaluation for special education and related services, and consideration of continued monitoring status during the first six weeks of the following school year shall be made by the Student Support Team (SST) before the end of the 2020-21 school year (by no later than May 31st). This Whole Student Support policy is intended to supplement existing family and student policies. This policy will provide guidance for students engaged in continuous education while in a remote setting and ensure that all students have access to high quality, equitable instruction. 12.Describe the LEA's policy for monitoring student behavior during distance learning. All parts of the distance learning discipline policy must be compliant with applicable local and federal law (e.g., limits on total days excluded, restrictions on reasons a student may be excluded). Your policy must include: A list of behaviors that could result in a student being excluded from distance learning (e.g., inappropriate conduct on virtual platforms); The manner in which the LEA will communicate with families of students who are excluded from distance learning; and The manner in which you will ensure that students who are excluded from distance learning have access to missed work. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 39 Schools are expected to implement their normal, in-person discipline policies and procedures when students are on school grounds. Per the Student Fair Access to School Amendment Act of 2018 , a suspension is defined as a student not being permitted on school grounds. An exclusion is defined as excluding the student from the school's educational program. Students who are not permitted to participate in synchronous learning must still be allowed to complete all assignments and access all educational materials. Overall Expectations for Behavior Mundo Verde is committed to educating the whole child and instructing with the social-emotional well-being of children in mind, as well as incorporating explicit instruction of emotional wellness at an age appropriate level. During synchronous and asynchronous learning, students are expected to exhibit our habits of ESPICA Empathy Speak your truth Perseverance Investigation Collaboration Appreciation Expected behavior for students who are learning remotely are similar to those for the physical school community. Students are expected to treat their teachers, classmates, staff, and physical and virtual environment with the same habits of community stewardship (ESPICA) expected during in person learning. The virtual learning environment requires additional expectations to ensure that students have a safe, high quality learning experience while outside of the school building. Students also need to exhibit additional behaviors given the new format of learning. Be present/attentive - sitting up and not doing other things like playing games or watching tv/videos on other devices, with cameras on during live meetings, small group instructions and one-on-one check-ins. Address classmates and teachers with respect - speaking to people in calm tones and using words that are affirming and humanizing, refraining from sarcasm and microaggressions, both verbally and in writing Use technology respectfully - gently and without overtly trying to break or cause the object to quit functioning, not placing it on an surface with force and intentionally Ask questions for additional understanding Attend classes with necessary materials and in a learning posture (e.g. sitting up, in a space for learning) Behavior Policy for Remote/ Distance Learning Teachers will communicate, teach and reinforce the expectations that follow: Students communicate respectfully with their classmates and their teacher while in class meetings, breakout rooms and private/public chat windows and discussion boards. Students follow all classroom and school expectations for using audio and video during classroom meeting times. Students mute their microphones when they are not speaking and while others are speaking. Students refrain from sharing inappropriate pictures or images during classroom meetings or on discussion boards. Students follow the same rules for whole group class meetings while in breakout rooms. Communication and Student Engagement Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 40 Students immediately return to whole group meetings once breakout rooms are over unless otherwise directed by the teacher. Students report to classroom meetings on time and remain in classroom meetings until being dismissed by the teacher. Students do not post any private information for themselves or others such as addresses, phone numbers or passwords on public chat or discussion boards. Students refrain from any forms of cyberbullying - harassing, threatening or abusing others within the school community while online. Students report all instances of cyberbullying to school staff immediately. Logging into the LMSStudents keep their username and passwords in a safe place and must not share them with other students. Students log into the LMS using their own log-in information. Students log into the LMS daily for classroom meetings, announcements or to submit assignments. Student WorkStudents complete work on time following the guidelines requested by the teacher for submission. Students should contact their teacher if they need additional time to complete assignments. Students submit their own work and provide citations for work created by others. Students communicate immediately with their teachers via email, phone or text if they have questions or require any technical support. Taking Care of Physical EquipmentStudents treat all school and personal electronic devices with care. Students keep food and drinks away from the equipment. Students keep devices out of extremely cold or hot areas. Students hold and carry computers properly. Students report any damage to school equipment as soon as possible. Teaching, intervention and supports for students who are experiencing difficulty with the skills will follow the school's tiered behavior system (aligned to RTI). Tier/ Behavior Possible Responses Tier 1: Teacher Managed Behaviors managed by the teacher, establishing positive classroom climate Refusing directions: Saying no, ignoring directions Seeking attention: Calling out, purposefully and intentionally making noises that call attention away from the teacher to side track the learning of others, side talking, distracting conversations in chat Minor temper tantrum: Shouting, whining/crying; disruptions Place student on mute Use teacher language to remind and redirect Use other positive examples Give choices Check in with child 1:1 to build therapeutic rapport, give students 5 - 10 minute check in on a consistent basis which is not denied based on previous behavior - non-contingent time Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 41 during live meetings or during recording response videos that are not related to the learning or topic of discussion Using inappropriate language: Outburst during live meetings, messages in chat room that are not related to the learning or topic of discussion, during response videosAssume positive intentions from student behavior - e.g. answer questions when asked, see interruptions as an excitement about learning taking place and desire to actively participate Make sure work is appropriate to the child Go back and revisit norms Inform a parent Tier 2: Teacher Managed with Support Behaviors that require intervention by teacher or crisis restoration personnel staff, to prevent or stop unsafe or harmful behavior Repeated and escalating Incidents in Tier 1 Temper tantrum; defiance - not following the directions given by a teacher, fellow, or associate that causes disruption Shouting, threatening teacher, loss of physical controlStop displaying student video and contact parent immediately (email, text, phone call, etc) Give student a break (use timer, placing on mute/stopping video) - raise hand virtually to return Offer choices Contact R&R associate for support for check-in with student Family conference (discretionary) Tier 3: Administrative Intervention Required Behaviors requiring administrator contact with family Repeated and escalating Incidents in Tier 2 Hate speech - words that are said or written to belittle a person's identity - race, gender, religion/belief system, or other aspect of one's identity. Reports of cyber-bullying Sexual activity/harassment Inappropriate use of technology Conference with family Mental health services referral Increase supervision by administrator during live zoom meetings Independent Reflection Long-term suspension / Expulsion** Monitoring of Student Behavior Administration/teachers will regularly review student discussion boards to make sure comments are appropriate. Administrators will pop-in frequently to observe classroom meetings. Teachers will provide ongoing reminders for students about classroom expectations within a virtual setting. School staff will regularly remind students of expectations for taking care of personal/school-issued equipment. Staff members will be responsible for supporting students and families with navigating the LMS and be available to provide students with technical support. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 42 Special PopulationsSchool staff will continue to track student participation and engagement with the LMS according to the policies outlined in the student handbook. Grades/attendance will be reported to families as per the school handbook Teachers will communicate concerns with families by phone, email, text or using the LMS. Communication with Families Regarding Expectations for Students School staff will share a copy of the Whole Student Support with families for their review prior to the beginning of the school year. Teachers will communicate with families on a weekly basis about student progress and/or student engagement by email, phone, text or via the LMS. School staff will immediately communicate with students and families when students are not meeting expectations for distance learning. Modifications to Distance Learning School staff may limit or restrict students' access to synchronous learning opportunities if they repeatedly fail to meet expectations for distance learning. Parents/guardians will be immediately notified about any changes to students' access to the LMS by email, phone, text or through the LMS. If students do not follow expectations for communicating respectfully with school staff or other students: School staff will remind students of expectations for distance learning. School staff will conference with families about school expectations not being met. Teachers will implement a behavior contract outlining expectations, strategies and benchmark celebrations to solicit the desired learning behaviors. Teachers may temporarily adjust students audio, video or chat privileges during synchronous meetings. Teachers may temporarily limit students' ability to post content on LMS chat or discussion boards. If students use the LMS inappropriately, such as share their username/passwords, intentionally misuse the LMS or log in as another user: School staff will remind students of expectations for distance learning. School staff will conference with families about school expectations not being met. If students engage in cyberbullying or display/share inappropriate images on the LMS: School staff will conference with families about school expectations not being met. These modifications to distance learning are designed to ensure that students will not be excluded from the virtual learning platform. 13.Describe the LEA's plan to serve students with disabilities, including: A description of how the LEA is maintaining IDEA timelines in collaboration with families and documenting delivered services; The steps the LEA is taking to ensure that family members with disabilities (e.g., a guardian with visual impairment) can access content to support their students' learning; and The manner in which LEA deliver related services for students in distance learning; Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 43 LEAs' obligations to serve the District's English Learners (ELs) are outlined in U.S. Department of Education Fact Sheet , District Municipal Regulations 5-E3101 , OSSE's state EL policies and procedures , and DC PCSB EL Services Assurance Letter , and OSSE's Serving English Learners During Distance Learning FAQ. This submission demonstrate show Mundo Verde BilingualPublic Charter School will meet the educational and social-emotional needs of students with disabilities in accordance with OSSE issued guidance in March and subsequent FAQ documents. Description of how LEA is maintaining IDEA timelines in collaboration with families and documenting delivered services Mundo Verde has identified all applicable timelines to include those associated with actions related to new referrals for evaluation for special education and related services, eligibility meetings, annual IEP review meetings, and reevaluation meetings. Those meetings, in accordance with internal policy and procedure, are scheduled with 10 days written notice to parents and all other members of the IEP team. Those evaluations that were interrupted by school closures and quarantines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic were initially discussed with families and it was agreed that the evaluation process would resume once school year 2020-21 began. Now that Mundo Verde has determined that the building will remain closed to students and non-essential staff for the entire first quarter, evaluators have been contacted, as have parents, to discuss in person evaluations. In cases where parents are comfortable with one-to-one evaluations, by appointment in the school building, with appropriate safety precautions in place, the evaluations will be scheduled and performed. In cases where parents are not comfortable, it will be documented that the evaluation will be performed once phase IV of recovery is in place. Every effort will be made to expedite the evaluations, eligibility determinations, IEP development, and IEP implementation. The steps the LEA is taking to ensure that family members with disabilities (e.g. a guardian with visual impairment) can access content to support their students' learning Mundo Verde has several deaf families, and has expanded our existing Memorandum of Understanding with a sign language interpreting service to include interpretation with the online platforms being used for instruction. No other families have identified as having disabling conditions that impede access to content in supporting their children's learning. Although not a disabling condition, some families identified unfamiliarity with technology skills needed to support their children's learning through online platforms being utilized as schools remain closed. Mundo Verde contracted with an assistive technology specialist, who works with identified families to build their technology skills to more effectively support the learning of their children. The manner in which LEA deliver related services for students in distance learning Mundo Verde uses teletherapy to deliver related services for students in distance learning. Distance learning has highlighted the need for Related Service Providersto work not only with the students that require these services, but also with the parents. Most notably,occupational therapists, speech/language pathologists, assistive technology consultants for augmentative and alternative communication, and Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapists have devoted time apart from the prescribed related services for students to work with parents. Mundo Verde has contracted for parent training in the area of the Principles of ABA, for its The manner in which the LEA will support parent training for students receiving related services through distance learning; The manner in which LEAs will deliver recovery services to students with disabilities during the 2020-21 school year and how LEAs will communicate those services to families; The steps LEAs will take to ensure that students with disabilities are assessed upon return to school to determine the nature and severity of the impact of learning loss on their receipt of educational benefit; and The steps LEAs will take to support the delivery of recovery services to students in the care of the District of Columbia and students experiencing homelessness. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 44 students with autism spectrum disorders. The manner in which the LEA will support parent training for students receiving related services through distance learning Mundo Verde will continue to contract for parent training with related service providers to include parent training on the principles of applied behavior analysis for students with autism spectrum disorders, tips for keeping students engaged with online learning platforms, skill building on the assistive technology used to support learning, and counseling services for families being most negatively impacted by the effects of isolation, social distancing, and trauma related to the COVID-19 crisis. The manner in which LEAs will deliver recovery services to students with disabilities during the 2020-21 school year and how LEAs will communicate those services to families Mundo Verde's IEP case managers will contact every family on their caseload to discuss the results of progress reporting just prior to the COVID-19 school closure, progress reporting from April 2020 - June 2020 before Summer Break, progress reporting from Extended School Year (ESY) services, and results of universal assessment that will be performed at the start of the 2020-21 school year. These data, in the context of each child's IEP will be considered. Although Mundo Verde will follow recent OSSE guidance to NOT revise IEPs, but rather to agree to services, supports, and hours that might need to be adapted, given the current circumstance of continued school closure. All agreements will be documented through a Prior Written Notice (PWN), and all communications between school staff and parents will be documented in the Communication Log of SEDS. Mundo Verde has a cadre of Intervention/Special Education Teachers trained in research-based reading, written language, and mathematics interventions, who will be delivering recovery services to those students with disabilities who have suffered learning loss. Mundo Verde will be expanding that cadre of Intervention/Special Education Teachers through training of additional personnel to meet the increased needs for recovery services. At students' annual IEP review meetings or by no later than April 1, 2021, the IEP team will determine any significant regression without recoupment of IEP critical life skills; as appropriate, the nature and amount of compensatory educational services will be determined, a Compensatory Educational Services Plan will be developed and implemented outside the traditional school day. The steps LEAs will take to ensure that students with disabilities are assessed upon return to school to determine the nature and severity of the impact of learning loss on their receipt of educational benefit Students with disabilities will be assessed along with every other Mundo Verde student, upon the start of the 2020-21 school year. Results of this universal assessment will be communicated by IEP case managers to families and documented. The Student Services Leadership Team will review all service trackers to determine the nature and severity of learning loss, and to make recommendations for prompt and sufficient intervention. Intervention/Special Education Teachers will be required to complete and submit weekly to the Student Services Leadership Team, service trackers documenting: Date of service Time of service Type of service IEP goal(s) addressed Progress toward IEP goal(s) addressed Evidence of progress toward IEP goal(s) addressed Student attendance/participation in service session Related Service Providers will continue to be required to submit monthly service trackers in SEDS. These will be due by the 5th day of each month to document the services rendered in the previous month. Mundo Verde will continue administer the Ages & Stages Questionnaire to all newly enrolled students aged 3- Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 45 5, but additionally, will re-administer the Ages & Stages Questionnaire to students aged 3-5 who were being monitored as a result of last year's scores, and/or, where students in this age range are suspected of having experienced learning loss that is negatively impacting on developmental milestones and progress. As appropriate, these students will be referred to the RTI process or for evaluation for special education and related services. The Student Services Team, which includes a Leadership group, Intervention/Special Education Teachers, Related Service Providers, and Dedicated Aides, will meet bi-monthly to discuss assessment results, progress monitoring, and learning loss related to COVID-19 school closures and corresponding interventions and supports needed for recovery. Special Education Instructional Coaches and General Education Instructional Coaches will meet regularly to ensure learning loss is being appropriately addressed. Student Services Leadership will have weekly check-ins with Student Services Team members to discuss learning loss experienced by specific students and measures implemented to facilitate recovery. The steps LEAs will take to support the delivery of recovery services to students in the care of the District of Columbia and students experiencing homelessness Mundo Verde's data team keeps the Student Services Team apprised of students that are experiencing homelessness or housing instability. The Student Services Leadership Team personally reaches out to each of these families to ascertain what type of support and assistance is needed. As appropriate, these families are connected to D.C. agencies and organizations to help meet their needs. As necessary, Mundo Verde will get paper work packets to these families, call with reminders of learning session start times, and ensure they have schedules with corresponding online links for sessions. All conversations are documented and regular follow- up will occur. Mundo Verde will follow all guidelines from OSSE on how to conduct identification and screening of ELs during virtual learning in accordance with guidance outlined in U.S. Department of Education Fact Sheet , District Municipal Regulations 5-E3101 , OSSE's state EL policies and procedures , and DC PCSB EL Services Assurance Letter , and OSSE's Serving English Learners During Distance Learning FAQ. As a dual immersion school, all teachers are considered teachers of language. Teachers have received training and coaching for teachers in strategies to support English Learners (Educators & Families for English Learners - EFs4ELs Project). In this way most supports and interventions for language learners are provided via core class instruction (Tier 1 learning). Language learning goals are identified in personalized learning plans and indicate how students receive more customized tools and supports for language development (Tier 1 with differentiation) and as needed academic mentors can make recommendations for students who need additional learning opportunities that are additive (Tier 2). In order to bridge the divide from live to digital learning we have employed tools that are adaptive to student needs in addition to other structures in our schedule to accommodate all students in a way that benefits English Learners.14.Describe the LEA's plan to serve ELs, including: A description of the EL program model and how it will maintain fidelity across in-person, distance learning and hybrid learning environments; The manner in which the LEA will set language goals across the four language domains of reading, writing, listening, and speaking to advance your EL students' English proficiency; The manner in which the LEA will provide language instruction in reading, writing, listening, and speaking to EL students during distance learning/hybrid learning environments by grade and by proficiency level; and The manner in which the LEA will provide EL students access to academic content by grade and proficiency level. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 46 Technology PolicyThe school has adopted Firefly an LMS available in both target languages. In the LMS recorded lessons will be available for students review and differentiated pacing. Learners are provided leveled text and other options for differentiation in addition to the daily schedule of lessons (e.g., videos instead of text). Teachers are conducting small group instruction targeted on helping students access the distance learning platforms, instructional resources. and academic content. Small groups are differentiated based on previous performance data, building upon previously mastered skills. Case managers are working closely with general education teachers to recommend appropriate scaffolds and accommodations. Instructional coaches are providing coaching to teachers on distance learning grounded in tenets of language acquisition, providing feedback on planning and implementation of lessons to ensure language access. Mundo Verde will use BOY language data to set language goals across the four language domains of reading, writing, listening, and speaking to advance EL students' English proficiency. Goals will be represented in each student's personalized learning plan alongside English Language Arts, Spanish Language Art, Social Emotional Skills, and math goals. Mundo Verde will provide language instruction in reading, writing, listening, and speaking to EL students during distance learning/hybrid learning environments by grade and by proficiency level through Tier 1 inquiry-based, integrated instruction with differentiation and through personalized instruction aligned to personalized learning plans for each and every student in the school. Mundo Verde will provide EL students access to academic content by grade and proficiency level through Tier 1 inquiry-based, integrated instruction with differentiation and through personalized instruction aligned to personalized learning plans for each and every student in the school. Mundo Verde is committed to the effective use of technology to both enhance the quality of student learning and the efficiency of school operations.

Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 47 If/how the school's technology policy differs by grade level. Pre-COVID-19 students' use of the school owned and operated technology resources was a privilege, not a right. During and post-COVID-19 student use of, and access to, school-owned-and-operated technology is a necessary part of the learning process for all students. Mundo Verde is committed to equitable access to technology resources necessary for learning for all students. Students (and where applicable, their families) must sign and submit a Student Technology Acceptable Use and Safety form. Beyond defining Mundo Verde's general policy on providing equitable access to technology and ensuring its safe use, this policy provides a series of steps to ensure a Return to School Technology Plan is in place. It will include training and support for teachers to adapt virtual learning skills for the classroom. Additionally, it will provide training in data and cyber security to assist staff in understanding the risks and responsibilities associated with the new learning environment. Equipment, Software, and Training Expectation and Supports for Students and Staff Per DC PCSB requirement, Mundo Verde will provide all students and staff with the necessary technology equipment, software, and training to fully participate in remote learning as indicated in the tables below.

Assessing Student/Family Technology Needs Equipment: We will review the inventory of what equipment that was previously assigned to returning students and staff and ensure that they are in working order. For new families and staff joining the school community, we will provide chromebooks. We will keep extra equipment on site at both campuses for students and staff to borrow for each expected type of equipment for use. We will do continuous assessment Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 49 of: Internet availability and speed, and number of household members expected to be using the Internet during the school day The numbers, types, and conditions of devices used in their homes to support virtual learning, including, but not limited to: computer, smartphone, chromebook, and tablet Security features on the technology (for younger children, especially) Software: Based on the instructional plan, we will determine what software best supports remote learning. We are in the process of completing a software inventory to determine what software was purchased or is in a trial period. We will inventory school technology staff strengths and needs. Inventory communication resources and protocols and continuously evaluate performance and needs. Training: We will survey families and staff on their training needs for equipment use and software use and build a schedule based on need once distance learning begins and initial training is provided. All training will be provided remotely. If family or staff need help setting up equipment, accommodations will be made to offer on-site training, following CDC social distancing guidance. Support for Students without Access Based on the needs assessment, students without internet access and/or devices will be provided access via a mobile hotspot and a chromebook. Where possible, students will be expected to retrieve hotspots and devices at the school, where they will also receive training and expectations for proper use and care of equipment. For students and families not able to retrieve equipment from the school, arrangements will be made for delivering the equipment directly to the student. Training, expectations and care of equipment will be provided virtually or in person in such cases. Replacing/Repairing Equipment Equipment: Mundo Verde will have loaner equipment available for families and staff on an as-needed basis. We will continue to provide families with the option to bring in damaged equipment to the school. In special circumstances, we will continue to provide personal delivery of the equipment on an as needed basis. Families will be assigned technology equipment and sign the use agreement for that equipment. In signing that agreement, families assume responsibility for damages based on mis-use. Those will be reviewed on a case by case basis by the school's technology liability committee. This committee will include a parent representative. Equipment malfunction versus user error or misunderstanding will be determined during scheduled appointments or helpdesk office hours. Software: Software malfunctions will be determined by monitoring the platforms email, calls to the helpdesk or during helpdesk office hours. We will also perform routine maintenance and updates network wide as needed. If students are locked out of software or forget their passwords, they can ask their teacher or reach out to helpdesk for support. Passwords are only shared with relevant staff. Training: In cases where certain families have repeat or severe issues with equipment or software, we will provide individualized training. To resolve issues, Mundo Verde will use internal staff across both campuses as well as support from our IT vendor, Dynamic Network Solutions on an as needed basis. DNS is also providing free trainings to DC families on basic technology usage that is available to Mundo Verde families. Student Safety and Limitations on School-Provided Devices Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 50 Devices issued to students by the school are limited to sites and downloads by our GSuite permissions. We will also use Zoom screen share and other tools to allow school personnel to remotely login to the device, update its software or disable the device entirely. Remote Learning Limitations on School-Provided Devices Equipment: Devices issued to students by the school should be used for only school purposes as signed and agreed to in the Acceptable Use Policy. Mundo Verde will not monitor usage outside of school hours however the family assumes full responsibility for appropriate use and financial responsibility when issued the equipment, including if the equipment goes missing. The Acceptable Use Agreement states that the device will only be used by the student however, we recognize that a Mundo Verde issued chromebook may be the only device in the household and may be used by other family members.

To the extent that the Company has access to \"education records\" under this Agreement, it is deemed a \"school official,\" as each of these terms are defined under FERPA. Company agrees that it shall not use education records for any purpose other than in the performance of this Agreement. Except as required by law or court order, Company shall not disclose or share education records with any third party unless: a) permitted by the terms of this Agreement, b) directed to do so, in writing, by Licensee, or c) to subcontractors who have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of the education records to the same extent required of Company under this Agreement.
