Every week around \u00a31 billion worth of retailgoods are sold in the United Kingdom on the basis of the measurement of theirquantity 1. Consumers need to be confident that they receive the quantity of goods they have paid for. And businesses need to be confident that they aretrading in a fair marketplace 2. 2 To provide consumer protection and a fair marketplace the Government has established a system for regulating units of measurement; the design and useof weighing and measuring equipment, and the sale of goods by quantity (seeexamples at Figure 1 ). The legislation, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales, is made under the Weights and Measures Act 1985 and toimplement European Community Directives. Regulating weights andmeasures for use in trade also ensures that competitive advantage is notgained purely through measurement systems in use; and improves overseascompetitiveness by ensuring companies conform to internationalmeasurement and calibration standards. Examples of short weight sales 1 Gainsborough Coal Merchant The coal merchant was found by Lincolnshire County Council Trading StandardsOfficers to be using a 25 kilogram weight to weigh coal bags which actuallyweighed only 23.5 kilograms. The weight had been drilled in the bottom andfilled with expanding foam. For this, and for having a large number of shortweight bags of coal and two incorrect weighing machines, the merchant wasprosecuted and ordered to pay \u00a32,320 in fines and costs. Building Supplies Company: Short Weight Sand A customer complained to Northamptonshire County Council Trading StandardsDepartment about having paid for five tonnes of sand but only receiving anamount which was 16 per cent underweight. Two test purchases by TradingStandards Officers of four tonnes were found to be 8.5 per cent and 11 per centunderweight. The company was also using equipment not suitable for measuringfor the purposes of trade. It was prosecuted and ordered to pay \u00a38,166 in finesand costs. The company director was fined \u00a31,800.

The legislation is intended to ensure that definedstandards apply to weights and measures used for trade across the country.Enforcement of the legislation falls to the Laboratory in matters relating to thedesign of weighing and measuring equipment and to over 200 local authorityTrading Standards Departments in matters relating to all other aspects. Thisreport examines the extent to which: !the Department has been able to identify the significant risks faced byconsumers or businesses with regard to weights or measures used for trade; !the legislation addresses those risks; and !the Department can monitor how effectively weights and measureslegislation is enforced. Identifying and assessing the significant risks to consumers and businesses 4 Inaccurate weighing and measuring equipment or the consequent sale of goods sold under weight may have only a small effect at the level of individualtransactions, but the overall effect across the economy can be considerable. Forexample, not providing full liquid measures of draught beer and cider allowslicensees to sell an estimated 200 million more 'pints' a year than they buy in, atan estimated value of about \u00a3130 million at wholesale prices. And, in 2000-01,an estimated 94,700 (five per cent) of the over two million items of equipmentinspected in service by Trading Standards Officers were found to be inaccurate.The Department's assessment of risks to fair trading is split between two unitswith responsibilities for overseeing different aspects of the legislation.Legislation on transactions in goods by weight or measure are overseen by theDepartment's Consumer and Competition Policy Directorate (the Directorate). 2executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES3executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Those relating to weighing and measuring equipment for use for trade fall within the remit of the Laboratory. Although no documented overview of risksacross the range of weights and measures legislation has been maintained, theDirectorate and the Laboratory maintain formal and informal links betweenthemselves and local authorities to exchange information on relevant issues. 5 The Directorate maintains contact with consumer and commercial interests through formal and informal means, including consulting on specific issuessuch as protecting the consumer against being served draught beer and cider inshort measure. Weights and measures research can be funded from theDirectorate's overall research budget. Although such funding has to competewith other research needs, which raises the possibility that not all weights andmeasures research may be done in a timely fashion, there has, to date, beensufficient funding available to meet identified research needs in the weights andmeasures area over the last five years. This research has often taken account ofissues raised by interested parties outside the Department, such as consumercomplaints and local authorities, or by developments at the EuropeanCommunity level. To date, three studies into testing net drained weight offoodstuffs and five studies into the use consumers make of quantity informationhave been carried out. 6 The Laboratory has a well-established programme of research with which to address issues relevant to the regulation of equipment, which allows it toidentify and assess new and changing risks arising from technical aspects ofweights and measures. The Legal Metrology 3Programme is run as part of the Department's National Measurement System. The current Programme, for theperiod 2002-05, has a budget of \u00a37.4 million, of which about \u00a32 million ismost directly relevant to the identification and assessment of risks. Progress ismeasured with reference to task milestones although, before 2002-03, theseonly covered a third of the Programme's value. The extent to which theoutcomes and achievements meet the Programme's objectives are not formallyassessed in a way which allows success to be rated for each three-yearprogramme and comparisons to be made between successive programmes.Achievement of task milestones will not, in itself, guarantee achievement of theProgramme's objectives. 7 Trading Standards Departments are required to provide the Department with statutory annual returns containing information on weights and measuresenforcement activity; the results of that activity; and the nature of anyinfringements identified. Information such as this is useful for identifyingchanges in the level and nature of enforcement and non-compliance, and anyrisks to consumer protection and fair trading these may represent. For the years1990-91 to 1993-94, the Department undertook annual exercises to identifythe level of weights and measures inspections carried out by Trading StandardsDepartments. In 2000, the Laboratory used available returns to try and establisha clearer picture of the state of local weights and measures work, but dataquality problems led to no conclusions being drawn. And for the years 2000-01 and 2001-02, inspection levels were again analysed as part of workdone to draft the Regulatory Reform Order on weights and measures due tocome into force in 2004 (see paragraph 9). But no regular analysis of trends inthe level of local weights and measures activity, or the results of that activity,has been carried out by the Department. Nor has it provided routine feedbackto Trading Standards Departments on the information collected. In recent years,few authorities have provided this information on a regular basis. For the threeyears 1998-99 to 2000-01, only 61 (31 per cent) of the 198 Trading StandardsDepartments provided the Department with a return each year. 3 'Legal metrology' focuses on the need for confidence and equity in measurements which directly concern the public, especially those measurements relating to efficiency in trade, public health andsafety, and environmental monitoring. The National Audit Office report focuses on those aspectsrelevant to trade.4executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 8 The legislation largely covers longstanding risks to achieving accurate, fair and legal weights and measures, and address blatant attempts to deliver shortweight. They have been updated to a degree to reflect the impact of technologyon the accuracy and reliability of weights and measures, for example, theinherent errors in automated packing systems. But the main body of legislationhas become increasingly out of date, with much of the Weights and MeasuresAct 1985 being a consolidation of the Weights and Measures Acts of 1963,1976 and 1979. The legislation has also become an increasingly complexcombination of European obligations and domestic legislation. For example,goods which were only sold wholesale in the past, and not covered by thelegislation, can now be bought retail in the same quantities (for example, Do-It-Yourself products) but remain outside the legislation. And the thresholdsbelow which quantity information is not required to be provided differsdepending on the product. The 1999 Consumer White Paper recognised thatthe age and complexity of the legislation 'confuses businesses and...consumers who have little, if any, idea of what they should see' 4. This is particularly the case for new businesses who can find understanding theamount of legislation especially burdensome. 9 The Laboratory has carried out a programme of updating the technical aspects of the legislation since 1985 through work carried out as part of the LegalMetrology Programme. More generally, the Department has recognised theneed to update and simplify the legislation, but progress has been slow.Consultations which started in 1999 on the general principles for simplifyingand clarifying the law on the sale of goods by quantity had, at the time of theNational Audit Office examination, not led to changes in the legislation. Thiswas initially due to the lack of Parliamentary time for primary legislation. Andconsultations begun in late 2000 on a specific aspect of weights and measureslegislation to improve consumer protection against draught beer and ciderbeing served in short measure have made slow progress because theDepartment has not been able to achieve a consensus between trade andconsumer groups and Trading Standards Departments on the best way forward.Alongside this exercise, the Department was engaged in a broader programmeto overhaul the consumer provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973 through theEnterprise Act 2002. This and the work underway on consumer credit tookpriority for legislative resources in this area. On broader weights and measuresreform, the main changes needed, as they relate to packaged goods, will bemade by a Regulatory Reform Order under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001and a consolidated food order under the Weights and Measures Act 1985. Bothare expected to come into force in 2004, following public consultation laterthis year. Consultations on improving the law relating to weighing andmeasuring equipment have been delayed awaiting the implementation ofrelated European legislation, which is itself not expected to come into forceuntil 2005 at the earliest. 10 S ome aspects of weights and measures law have been deregulated to reduce cost burdens on industry. Since 19805, manufacturers of non-automatic weighing machines (for example, shop counter scales) have been able toobtain a single design approval which is valid throughout the EuropeanCommunity instead of the separate approvals previously needed in eachMember State. And from 1999 6, manufacturers, installers and repairers of weighing and measuring equipment covered by Section 11 of the Weights andMeasures Act 1985 have been allowed to 'self-verify' that equipment installedfor use conforms with the approved design, rather than such checks beingmade by a Trading Standards Officer. 4 Department of Trade and Industry (1999), Modern Markets: Confident Consumers, paragraph 6.11. 5 The Measuring Instruments (EEC Requirements) (Amendment No.3) Regulations 1979 (SI1979/1459).6 The Deregulation (Weights and Measures) Order 1999, SI 1999/503.5executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Monitoring the enforcement of weights and measures legislation 11 New types of weighing and measuring equipment must receive 'type approval', normally from the Laboratory, before manufacturers can put them on themarket. The Laboratory carries out most such work in the United Kingdom. TheLaboratory does not collate information on instances of equipment found in usefor which a type approval certificate does not exist, although it told theNational Audit Office that such breaches were rare. The Laboratory has carriedout limited investigations into the degree of conformity of installed equipmentwith the approved designs for such equipment but, again, does not collateregularly instances of non-conformity. Such information would be useful inidentifying the extent to which installed equipment was bypassing theregulatory framework. 12 The Department is responsible for ensuring that the legislation is enforceable, but relies on local authority Trading Standards Departments to actually enforcethe legislation governing the installation and use of weighing and measuringequipment and of the use of quantity information for the sale of goods, forwhich they have certain legal duties. This is one of a wide range ofresponsibilities Trading Standards Departments have who, typically, can beresponsible for enforcing the requirements of over 80 Acts of Parliament, plusmany more pieces of subordinate legislation. The Office of the Deputy PrimeMinister in England, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh AssemblyGovernment have the lead within Government for developing a consistentapproach to the improvement of local services generally. Within thisframework, the Department oversees the weights and measures regulatoryregime and relies on local enforcement to ensure that the regime contributes toachieving defined standards of consumer protection and fair trading, whilstrecognising that variations in the level and nature of enforcement will existbetween Trading Standards Departments to reflect local priorities. 13 The National Audit Office examined whether there were significant variations in the scale and results of enforcement work between Trading StandardsDepartments. The National Audit Office found that voluntary guidelines,applicable at the time, set by local government on the frequency with whichbusiness premises should be inspected, based on different levels of risk 7, were not being fully applied. Under the guidance, high risk businesses shouldreceive an annual visit, subject to local discretion to reflect other enforcementactions such as education and awareness campaigns. In 2000-01, on average,only 56 per cent of high risk businesses 8were visited by Trading Standards Departments. The lack of legal powers available to the Department to enable itto set minimum levels of inspection has meant it has not considered itappropriate to check that inspections have been carried out to therecommended frequencies. 7 The Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services guidance recommends that high risk businesses should be inspected annually, medium risk businesses once every two years, and low riskbusinesses once every five years. 8 These are premises assessed as high risk for all purposes not just in relation to weights and measures. The risk rating does not always reflect the metrological risk. For example, a landfill site may have a low overall risk from a consumers point of view, but represent a high metrological risk because the weighbridge used to weigh incoming fill materials (as a basis for tax collection) could be subject to adverse environmental conditions.\"Every review of weights and measures has identified a lack ofdata and information on the national picture as a substantial problem when it comes to planning and securing resources.\" DTI Legal Metrology Programme 2002-056executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 14 Wide variations also exist in the average error rates found by different types of local authority (Figure 2) . The Department is unable to say whether such differences are legitimate or not, in part because of a lack of regular analysis ofthe annual statutory returns from Trading Standards Departments (see paragraph7 above) and the growing incompleteness of its database. The Department doesnot know whether the differences in the proportion of products inspectedwhich were found to be inaccurate was due to greater vigilance on the part ofsome Trading Standards Departments; or due to more effective prevention andeducation programmes. 15 The Department has powers to inspect local authorities for the purpose of gathering information about arrangements for enforcing weights and measureslegislation, but these powers were last used in 1964. This may be because therewas no cause to use them. But recent studies by the Audit Commission 9and Accounts Commission10have highlighted major variations in the levels and types of service provided by Trading Standards Departments, that suggest therewould have been grounds for inspecting local arrangements in the interests ofmaintaining consistency nationally. However, these powers do not allow theDepartment to intervene to address cases of poor performance. Since 1999,local authority trading standards work, including weights and measuresenforcement, has been covered by the Best Value inspection regime whichincludes powers to allow the appropriate Secretary of State to intervene wherelocal authorities fail to provide best value. Any decision to intervene, however,must be based on an authority's performance against one or more Best Valueperformance indicators. Trading Standards work is covered by a single indicatorwhich is now recognised as being inadequate for the purposes of identifying 9 Audit Commission (1999), Measure for Measure: the best value agenda for trading standards services, London. 10 Accounts Commission (2002), Made to measure?

In the absence of an appropriate indicator, regular Departmental analysis of the statutory returns itreceives from local authorities could have helped to identify authorities wherethe level and effects of weights and measures enforcement work were widelydifferent from the majority. This could have provided prima facie evidence ofthe need for further investigation by the Audit Commission to establish whetherthose variations were legitimate or represented a failure to achieve best value.However, the Commission would not be obliged, and sometimes not able, toconduct a Best Value inspection. So there has been no ready way for theDepartment to secure change in any case of weak local enforcement of weightsand measures legislation. 16 The Department currently does not have sufficient information with which to set defined standards for trading standards work generally or weights andmeasures enforcement in particular. Lack of use of local enforcement datareflects concerns about the consistency of local data and therefore thereliability of the national picture. The Laboratory is carrying out work to gain amore reliable national picture as part of the 2002-05 Legal MetrologyProgramme. In addition, the Department and the Laboratory have taken thelead in developing, along with local authority Trading Standards Departments,a new National Performance Framework for Trading Standards Services . The Framework, which was introduced in April 2002, and requires local authoritiesto provide annual Service Delivery Plans and performance information returns,is intended to improve the consistency, performance and capability of TradingStandards Departments. By October 2002, 87 per cent of local authorities hadprovided their Service Delivery Plans. The Framework will be supported by asystem of peer review, currently under development, designed to encourageimproved planning and performance. Alongside the Framework, theDepartment is also seeking to raise the capabilities of Trading StandardsDepartments through supporting the training and skills development of TradingStandards Officers. In time the Framework should improve the quality ofinformation available on local authority weights and measures enforcement. Atthe time of the National Audit Office review, the Department was consulting onthe level and type of information local authorities would be required toprovide. The information obtained will be fed back to local authorities,consumers and business by the publication of an annual report. 17 The Department currently has no means of measuring the effectiveness of Trading Standards Departments and the levels of compliance they achieveeither across the full range of the legislation they have to enforce or in relationto weights and measures legislation in particular. The National PerformanceFramework will increase the quality and quantity of information availableabout trading standards performance generally, and the Department hasproposed a number of performance measures, including one intended tomeasure compliance and the effectiveness of enforcement activity. This is acomposite measure, relating to the full range of trading standards activity,which will not by itself help the Department to identify effectiveness andcompliance levels with regard to weights and measures. At the time of theNational Audit Office review, the Department had decided that it will collectinformation specifically on weights and measures enforcement as well, but wasstill consulting local authorities on the exact information to be included.8executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 18 In order to ensure that the legislation is applied consistently, so that weights and measures used in trade are accurate, reliable and fair acrossthe country, the Department should: i) develop a coherent and comprehensive overview of the risks to accurate, fair and legal weights and measures in order to ensure that identificationand assessment cover the full range of potential risks and anyinterdependencies between them; ii) urgently pursue the modernisation and simplification of weights and measures legislation which it has identified as being out of date and over-complex so as to provide a clear basis for effective enforcement by theLaboratory and Trading Standards Departments;Recommendations9executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES iii) develop the National Performance Framework in order to: a) establish baseline information on local weights and measures enforcement work which is accurate, timely and comprehensive; b) establish how weights and measures enforcement work can contribute to achieving defined standards of consumer protectionand fair trading, taking account of different local business profilesand the risks to accurate, fair and legal weights and measures theypresent; and c) introduce appropriate performance measures for local authority weights and measures enforcement work with which to monitorand help improve the performance of Trading StandardsDepartments, and to reduce variations in performance betweenthem; and iv) use the Framework to ensure that effective monitoring and inspection of weights and measures enforcement work is fully integrated withinbroader performance regimes for local authorities.
