Like any health care opon, an H S A has advantages and disadva ntages. As you weigh your opons, think about your budget and what health care you are likely to need in the next year. If you are generally healthy and want to save for future health care expenses, an H S A may be an aracve choice. Or if you are near rerement, an H S A may make sense because t he money in the H S A can be used to oset costs of medica l care aer rerement. Or if you think you might need e xpensive medical care in the ne xt year and are able to meet the higher deducble, an H S A account can help maximize your tax s avings. Contribuons made to the H S A are not available to those membe rs who are enrolled in any part of Medicare, or other disqualifying coverage. If you are covered on the High D educble Health Plan (HDHP), bu t you are also covered on another group health plan (such as your spouse's group plan) that is no t an HDHP, you would also be ineligi- ble to accept or make contribuons to an H S A. An H S A is not available to emp loyees who are enrolled in a sp ouse's medical spending account (FSA), unless the spouse's medic al FSA is a limited medical FSA . How much can you put in the health savings accounts? Maximum contribuons are $3,550 fo r single coverage and $7,100 for family coverage for 2020 (employer and employee contri buons combined). If the employee is age 55+ they can contribute an addional $1,000 into their H S A account. The amounts contribu ted by Lake Forest College ($500 for individual, $750 for employee plus one, and $1000 for family) a re included in these annual totals. Lake Forest College employer con tribuon will be provided in tw o equal installments in January and June. Your Health Savings Account will be administered by Optum. HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT ADVANTAGES Page 6 OPEN ENROLLMENT 2020 Tax Saving & Earned Interest \u2014Contribuons are tax-deducble and earn tax-free interest.

Long Term Savings \u2014Contribuons to your HSA accumul ate and roll over year-to-year with no limit, which allows the account to grow tax-deferred. Rerement Bonus \u2014 Aer age 65, funds may be withdrawn for any reason with no pe nales. (If used for non-medical purposes, however, taxes will be imposed.)
