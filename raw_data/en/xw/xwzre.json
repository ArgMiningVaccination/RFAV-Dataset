Are You Happy? During my first year of fellow - ship, I was attempting to engage a 14-year-old girl in therapy. Three months earlier, she had been admitted to our psychiatric hospital after posting a suicide note on a social media website. Her family had been totally caught off-guard by the possibility that the straight-A, straight-laced, eighth grader was severely depressed. I came to understand the surprise: she hid it well. How are you? \"Good\" she said while smiling. How's school going? \"Fine.\" Smile. How are things at home? \"Good.\" Smile. All smiles, no problems. I knew she was hiding things that desperately needed to come to the surface. The social media post was more revealing than the first month of therapy sessions. I kept trying to imagine her reading it out loud during an appointment, that lengthy, furious rant about her family, friends and teachers misunderstand - ing her, feeling that her efforts weren't good enough, nobody was ever happy with her, and she was never happy with herself. There was no point, and she might as well just \"end it all.\" It felt like every ounce of genuine emotion she ever had was poured out in that social media post. Then there was nothing left, which was probably the point of it; a monumental one-time only purge of negative affect, thereby eliminating the need to ever express any again in the future. My working assumption was that this girl was using typical defenses such as isolation of affect or reaction formation to hide her true feelings She needed to cry, or scream, or punch a pillow, or say she hated something. Anything to Michael A. Shapiro, MDprevent the eventual re-accumulation of negative feelings, which she would repress until it was no longer humanly possible until she exploded again. After a few weeks, she finally started opening up. Although I would like to give myself credit as a therapist, I think what wore her down was boredom. Maybe initially she had been trying to convince me that she didn't need therapy, the transference serving as an example of her feeling of being misunderstood because she never was willing to let me understand her. Inevitably, she must have realized that I wasn't giving up that easy. I perceived her as being less defensive as she would share stories with me, but still did not verbalize any emotions. How's school? \"Well, we had a pop quiz in geometry that I didn't know about.\" Smile. How's home? \"My new jacket is missing, and I think my sister took it. That's nice.\" Smile. It wasn't really nice, that was not the honest feeling she had. But I didn't know if she knew that, or if she knew that I knew. So I asked her: was it really nice? \"Well, no.\" Smile. So that was sarcasm? \"Uh, yah .\" Smile. So what to make of her sarcasm? Normally I find sarcasm a perfectly acceptable language for communication from teens. In fact, the use of humor in therapy with adolescents has many advocates (Drell 2015; Prerost 1984). Adolescents often use \"hostile aggres - sive humor\" in initial psychotherapy encounters as a way to release negative emotions, and in fact doing so \"allows for the release of impulses\" and \"can provide the inhibited youth with the atmosphere for personal growth. But I ignored all that, or more likely did not know it. I considered her sarcasm a defense, and I was determined to pierce it and get this girl to more directly emote. The first months of therapy felt like teaching her the alphabet. \"This girl in my class is spreading rumors about me, so that's awesome .\" Is it really awe- some? How does it actually feel? \"What do you mean?\" Did it make you feel sad? Angry? \"I don't know ... angry, I 'I felt angry'? \" Uggghh ... I felt angry.\" Smile. \"I thought I aced my Spanish mid-term, but I got a C. Yay!\" Smile. So you're happy about your C? \"No!\" Well, you said 'yay' and you are smiling, that usually means somebody is happy. \" Ugh .... My grade made me ... upset.\" Like you have an upset stomach? \"No, not that.\" Were you angry? Could it be ... sad? \"Yeah, I guess, just a little. No, not sad ... just ... disappointed.\" Can we just call it sad? \"Sure.\" Smile. Could she do any of this without smiling? \"No, I always smile.\" Ugggghh (that was mine). The passive aggressive expression of her anger and self-doubt was getting to me. I wanted to make this girl cry (there's that countertransference again). Genuine negative emotion that she could both experience and correctly name would be awesome . And then one day she came into my office. Instead of plopping down in the chair with a burst of energy, she slowly slumped down. She did not make eye contact, she looked at her shoes. I could see that she was genuinely sad. She never looked like this before, and my initial reaction was genuine concern. What happened? She started to tell me, in between sniffles. \"This morning ... my sister took the car to school. My cat was in the driveway ... she ran over my cat. It died.\" I'm so sorry, I said instinc - tively. And then, very faintly, I could see continued on page 246 COLUMNS246 AACAP NEWSI'm Sad! Are You Happy? continued from page 245 that she was crying. There was a box of tissues on my desk that was easily within her reach, but they went unused. It was probably for about two seconds, although it felt longer. And then I had a thought. The thought occurred to me that this is a real-time moment of negative affect. Could she now identify it? I shifted in my seat, finally prepared to speak. She must have known what was coming; we had been practicing her emotional alphabet for weeks. I was going to ask her how she was feeling. I started to say, \"So, how are you feel- \" when she finally looked up at me, stared me dead in the eyes, and angrily shouted, \"I'M SAD THAT MY CAT DIED! OK?!\" Then her gaze returned to her shoes. And there it was. I messed up. I knew immediately that I did something \"wrong,\" but I wasn't quite sure what I did that was wrong. Isn't she sup - posed to talk about her feelings? Metaphorically speaking, I felt the bump we just hit on our therapeutic car ride, time to look in the rearview mirror. Things were going smoothly, save for the dead cat. The patient was genuinely sad, I was genuinely empathic, and then ... oh. That's what happened. I stopped doing what a genuine human being would do and starting doing what I thought a therapist should do. In reviewing common mistakes by begin - ning therapists (Alshuler 1989), I would categorize my transgression as a \"pre - mature over interpretation.\" The reasons for making such an error are usually either the therapist being uncomfortable with the patient's issue or emotion, the patient being emotionally uninvolved, or the therapist needing reassurance about his theory and clinical work. Then it suddenly hit me - how effec - tively do non-patients, adolescents no less, express how they feel anyway? Do people come home from work and tell their spouse, \"My boss yelled at me and that made me sad\"? Or \"This kid at school made me angry today\"? I don't think people do that; they tell a story while they make facial expressions, use their tone of voice, or grunt or cry or yell - things that therapists are not supposed to do (I learned later that they can). Therapists are supposed to use their words to communicate about feel - ings, but my patient did not have to learn to be a therapist, and I did not have to teach her how to be a therapist. She just needed to be a 14-year-old girl, and I had forgotten that. I suddenly realized that words were not always the best, most efficient way of emotional commu - nication, and the genuine emotion and crying this patient displayed was worth more than any words she could have chosen to say. So I messed up, what to do about it? Research has noted that patients have better perception than their therapists at identifying countertransference (Delgado et al. 2015), and to acknowledge the real relationship with the patient, and to take responsibility, would be the most helpful. At the next appointment, I apologized to the girl for my actions the previous session, and that I realized it could have come across as insensitive. She sarcastically said, \"Yah!\" She still seemed upset, but then she moved on to telling me her next story. She continued to see me for the next four years through her high school graduation. I was fortu - nate that I had not blown it, but I also felt fortunate that this girl continued to trust me with her feelings, passions, and desires, and for finally allowing some - one to understand her. I learned a very valuable lesson from her: sometimes a genuine human being is just what the doctor should have ordered. m References Altshuler KZ (1989).

COLUMNS NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2017 247 continued on page 248Assessing Parental Awareness of Child Mental Health in China and Egypt: A Novel Approach to International Integrated Care The World Health Organization attributes thirty percent of the non-fatal disease burden to mental disorder and estimates twenty percent of children and adolescents suffer from some mental health (MH) disorder worldwide. About half of the world's population lives in countries with a psy - chiatrist to population ratio of less than 1 to 100,000 people and the number of experts in child MH are even less than that (Moonkin, World Bank Group and W.H.O., 2016). These figures indicate the necessity of integrating MH in primary care to reduce stigma, improve service delivery, and decrease MH global burden in the long term (Vigo et al., Lancet, 2016). In 2009, we created the University of Chicago Behavioral Health Questionnaire (UCBHQ) for a pilot study in an immigrant population of a Chicago-suburb. The UCBHQ consist of 12 demographic questions and 24 behavioral health questions for parents/ caregivers that focus on assessing the following: a) understanding of common MH terms such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, autism, etc.; b) beliefs about the etiology of MH problems; c) perceived barriers to receiving MH care for their children, such as, culture, religion, spiri - tual beliefs or the influence of media; d) the availability/access to MH care; and e) previous experience with MH, e.g., seeking MH services for self or family members or attending a MH workshop. Native speakers translated and back-translated the questionnaire in Arabic for accuracy and both English and Arabic versions were used in the study. We found factors such as gender, education level, time in the U.S. and experience with MH problems in the family led to distinct differences in the understand - ing of MH problems, their etiology and comfort level in seeking care (Afzal et al., Transcult Psychiatr, 2017). Some of the sample questions from UCBHQ can be viewed in Table 1. Concurrently, The University of Chicago opened a Center in Beijing which led to new opportunities for research and collaboration in Asia. The Wuhan University Medical Education Reform (WUMER) project was a university-wide initiative for comprehensive reform of their medical education, curriculum and methodology. In 2012, we part - nered with Department of Pediatrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University to complete a similar project as the one in Chicago. For cultural accuracy, two native Mandarin speakers translated and back-translated the UCBHQ in Mandarin-Chinese. We collected around 250 questionnaires from parents/care - givers attending pediatric clinics. This study was the first of its kind in China and was able to identify various barriers to pediatric MH in China, including differences in gender and education level of the participants (manuscript in preparation). Khalid I. Afzal, MD, and Karam Radwan, MD Inspired by our studies in Illinois and China, our colleagues (see acknowl - edgments)* in Egypt expressed interest in pursuing a similar project there. Egypt is a country with a population of over 90 million in which children and adolescents constitute 38% of the total population. To accommodate the regional Arabic language differences, UCBHQ required minor modifications that were completed by native Egyptian Arabic language experts. So far, we have collected more than 1900 ques - tionnaires from parents visiting Primary Healthcare Clinics for non-MH needs in Beni Suef Governate, located about 80 miles south of Cairo. These clinics are funded by the Ministry of Health, Egypt. The preliminary results are invaluable to providing an understanding of paren - tal awareness around pediatric mental health needs, recognizing barriers and identifying areas for immediate and long-term interventions. In China, we provided educational materials for parents in Mandarin after they participated in the aforementioned study. Subsequently, we presented on pediatric MH topics such as pediatric depression, anxiety, ADHD and catato - nia for physicians including psychiatrists. We led the interdisciplinary case confer - ence to review complex med-psych cases. The discussion allowed us to create new channels for advancement of integrative care. Last year, we sponsored a 2-day MH workshop at the University of Chicago Center in Beijing. Our focus was to promote interdisciplinary dialogue about raising MH awareness. We were very pleased with the level of participa - tion and across different specialties of our Chinese counterparts on a vari - ety of topics being presented by our faculty members.COLUMNS248 AACAP NEWSInternational Integrated Care continued from page 247 Kolko and Perrin identified familiarity and access to primary healthcare provid - ers and lack of perceived MH stigma as desirable factors for integrated care, and we hypothesize that the high partici - pation rate in our samples was likely linked to the surveys being offered in primary care settings (Kolko and Perrin, J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol, 2014). As opposed to the existing emphasis on prevalent related and intervention focused studies in pediatric primary care (Asarnow et al., JAMA Pediatr 2015; Kolko et al., Pediatrics, 2014), our approach was novel in assessing parents/caregivers awareness of their children's and adolescents' MH needs. Identifying barriers and strengths in families can facilitate highly individualized care with a potential impact on long-term treatment adherence. Furthermore, such an approach is both time and resource efficient especially in low and middle-income countries, and likely to empower, encourage and motivate primary care providers to strengthen their role in MH delivery and enhance integrated care. Current demographic trends speak to the implications and significance of this questionnaire and our study here in the U.S. Pew Research Center estimates that this country will not have a single racial or ethnic majority by the year 2055 (Cohn and Caumont, Pew Research Center, 2016). This increasingly diverse population will pose unique challenges to MH providers in keeping themselves culturally informed about distinct psychi - atric presentations, attitudes towards MH care, and service delivery. Partnering with primary care providers in parent/ caregiver-focused projects similar to ours may offer to: a) Assess parental awareness of pediatric MH in cultural and ethnic cohorts b) Identify barriers to receiving MH care c) Recognize areas of strength and resil - iency; and,Table 1 University of Chicago Behavioral Health Questionnaire (UCBHQ) Sample Questions Behavioral or mental health conditions are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain: Strongly agree 5 4 3 2 1 Strongly disagree Behavioral or mental health conditions are caused by nutritional deficiencies: Strongly agree 5 4 3 2 1 Strongly disagree If yes, which nutritional deficiencies? ________________________________________________________ Behavioral or mental health conditions are present only in Western cultures and not in Eastern cultures: Strongly agree 5 4 3 2 1 Strongly disagree Behavioral issues in children are part of mental health: Strongly agree 5 4 3 2 1 Strongly disagree Behavioral issues in teenagers are part of mental health: Strongly agree 5 4 3 2 1 Strongly disagree Problems in mathematics, reading or writing are considered to be a part of behavior or mental health in children: Strongly agree 5 4 3 2 1 Strongly disagree I am comfortable in seeking help for behavioral or mental health needs of children: Yes No My SPIRITUAL/RELIGIOUS beliefs allow me to seek help for behavioral or mental health needs of my child: Yes No My CULTURAL beliefs allow me to seek help for behavioral or mental health needs of my child: Yes NoCOLUMNS NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2017 249d) Develop individualized MH interven - tions in primary healthcare settings. m Acknowledgements We are thankful to our colleagues Nina Liu, MD , Northshore University, IL and Maha Emadeldin, MD ,* Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Beni Suef University, Egypt who have been instru - mental in conducting this project in China and Egypt respectively.

Apply for AACAP's Advocacy and Collaboration Grant. If approved, you can use the funds to start something that may well grow into something inspirational. In 2008, the California Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry received it's AACAP Advocacy and Collaboration Grant. We used the grant to offset costs of a two-part joint advocacy program with Cal NAMI. We began having advocacy collaboration conferences in the fall where physicians met with patients, families, and advocacy groups to discuss what was working and what wasn't working in mental health delivery in California. Although we had different backgrounds, we discovered that we shared a lot of the same concerns and hopes for the future. For many, it was the first time for psychiatrists to meet patients or family members outside of a treatment setting. This turned out to be empowering for individuals of both organizations, and this opportunity gave both organizations a stronger, unified voice when we met the following spring to advocate together at our state capitol for bills we supported. The success of that event led us to invite another organization to join us the following year. United Advocates for Children and Families became our new allied collaborator. The second year was inspiring and uplifting as well. We're now in our ninth year of advocacy and collaboration with other groups. Some, Robert Holloway, MD & Advocacy Committeelike Cal NAMI, have remained with us every year, while others have not been able to continue with us. We were fortunate enough to receive the grant for three years in a row. It was a lifeline to the early stages of our program, as charging a fee to attendees would have discouraged attendance, and spend - ing members' money on an unproven activity would have been risky. Now we have not only a set of annual events, but we have friends and allies across the state who frequently join us in support - ing or opposing measures that impact mental health. The recipients of AACAP's 2017 Advocacy and Collaboration grants have some great ideas. Tampa Bay Council of Child Psychiatry is working with the University of South Florida's Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry to educate Hillsborough County Schools about emergency assessments and after - care programs to better utilize services and reduce involuntary assessments. Tennessee Academy of Child Psychiatry is tackling stigma associated with mental illness with a film. Washington State Council of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry is planning a spring listen - ing event with legislators followed by a fall forum to continue engaging with legislators to find ways to improve the state's mental health treatment system. Louisiana Council of Child Psychiatry is establishing an Autistic Spectrum Disorder program at the Children's Hospital of New Orleans. The funds will help them educate the community about services offered. The Michigan Council of Child Psychiatry is planning a joint meeting with the Michigan Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics to discuss topics of interest to both pediatri - cians and child psychiatrists. There are many ways to advocate, many ways to collaborate, and many ways to create strong partnerships for a better future. Be creative and let your passion drive you. Who knows, you may just start something big. Look at AACAP's website ( http://www.aacap.org/ App_Themes/AACAP/Docs/Advocacy/ how_to_be_an_advocate/2018-Appli - cation-and-Guidelines.pdf ) as soon as possible for instructions to apply for a grant by the deadline of January 5, 2018, and start your plans. m NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2017 251 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYApproximately one percent of the world's population, are currently uprooted, with 22.5 million refugees seeking safety in another country and 65.6 million people forcibly displaced worldwide (UNHCR, 2017). A refugee is a person who lives outside his/her country of nationality and unable to return due to persecu - tion of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Over half of the world's displaced population are children. The stresses to which most refugees are exposed can be thought of in different stages of their lives - (1) from their home country of origin, then (2) during the migration flight to safety, and (3) to the resettlement period in a host country. In their home countries, many youth have been forced to flee their homes due to war exposure or armed conflict and have therefore witnessed violence, torture, traumatic loss of loved ones, and separation from friends and school. Parental distress is com - mon, along with general feelings of insecurity. Migration can also pose dangers with separation from family, unstable sources of food or housing, and potential for trafficking or sexual violence. The post-migration phase of resettlement can often be referred as a period of \"secondary trauma,\" as youth struggle to adapt to a new culture, language, peer group, as well as acculturative stress and genera - tional stress with their parents or caregivers. With globalization and the recent wars in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, as well as the conflicts in central America's northern triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras), we have more refugees and unaccompanied minors landing in our backyards. The role of the child/ado - lescent psychiatrist becomes more prominent, as many will be asked to help the increasing number of war-affected youth locally and globally. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (2017). Available at: http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html . The war in Syria has reached intolerable levels of human suf-fering and despair. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed, hundreds of thousands have been trapped in besieged areas, and tens of thousands have been tortured. UNICEF estimates that some 8.4 million Syrian children, more than 80% of the Syrian child population, have now been affected by the conflict in Syria. The numbers of wounded survivors, many with amputations, severe burns, or paralysis, cannot yet be assessed; and at least 13 million Syrians have been force - fully displaced within Syria and into its neighboring countries. Children living through wars and conflict suffer many consequences includ - ing post-traumatic stress symptoms, psychosomatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, disturbed play, and behavioral, emotional, and sleep problems, suicide risk, substance use and physical health risks. Gross violations of international law, such as chemical attacks on civil - ians, targeting of health facilities and INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE Saving the Lost Generation of Syria continued on page 252 Yassar Kanawati, MD, and Suzan Song, MD, MPH, PhD health personnel, widespread breach of medical neutrality, and blocking access of whole communities to food, water, medicine, and health care, have been used as methods war. The global health community cannot stand by. It is our responsibility to save the lost genera - tion in Syria, the survivors of multiple and severe traumas and losses. This article sheds light on best practices for trauma recovery, including psycho - logical treatments to Syrian refugees carried on by SAMS (Syrian American Medical Society). Many studies have examined the effects of exposure to war, conflict, and ter - rorism on young children. They have all revealed a wide array of conse - quences including post-traumatic stress symptoms, psychosomatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, disturbed play, and behavioral, emotional, and sleep problems, substance use, suicide risk, and physical disease risk. These mental health and physical risks following exposure to war and conflict are also seen among displaced populations and among refugees. War can have devas - tating effects due to effects on parents, survival needs, and harm to fundamental systems that nurture and protect child development. The greatest effects on 252 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYchildren occur when parents are killed, harmed, terrified, or unable to function, and when the child experiences violent harm to themselves or loved ones, threats of such violence, or engages in harming others. I have found that the best practices for trauma recovery include: (1) Deep understanding of the Local Culture and Practices (Religion, Family structure), (2) Rebuild Social Networks (friends, school, neighbors, play, sport) that pro - mote Support, Healing, Reconstruction, Self-worth, and Trust, (3) Re-establish a Sense of Normalcy, including Daily Routine of Family, Community, and Life (School, meals, Sport), and (4) Education and School: where schooling represent a state of normalcy, a chance to be with friends, and enjoy their support and encouragement, where they can develop new coping and survival knowledge that builds child's personality, talents, physical and mental abilities to their fullest potential. SAMS has established programs to provide treatment and care to the Syrian communities in Jordan, Lebanon, and inside Syria. Each program consists of Social Workers, Psychotherapists and Psychiatrists. Services Provided are: Social Support: To facilitate Resilience, children need to be provided with a Stable environment, and a loving and nurturing community. SAMS outreach workers would make visits to the Syrian Families to: (1) Provide some families with food, especially in the besieged areas to prevent sexual exploitation of the children as price for their food, (2) Assess the family members for PTSD/ Depression, (3) Evaluate the need for any Medical Assistance and referring them to Medical professionals in the com - munity, (4) Assist the children to pursue Education: we rent schools to provide the children with basic Education needs, and (5) Assist with Vocational Training for the Widows. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. (Chinese Proverb) Therapy/Treatment: (1) Individual Supportive and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, (2) Family Therapy (Supportive, Psychoeducational): for the parents whose children with symptoms of Depression, PTSD, behavioral trou - bles, bedwetting, and refusal to go to school, (3) Group Therapy (Cognitive, Behavioral, Supportive): for Mothers and Teenagers survivors of multiple losses and traumas, (4) Play/Art Therapy for young children, and (5) Medications: It is extremely difficult to provide medications to the inside of Syria due to Border's Closure, especially in South Syria, close to Jordan. SAMS members have been trying to provide best treatment practices to the Syrian refugees, despite our limited budget and resources. m Dr. Yassar Kanawati is a board-certified child/adolescent and adult psychiatrist, with a focus on addiction psychiatry. She finished her psychiatry residency and fel - lowship at Wayne State University and is currently an Assistant Professor at Emory Medical School and Morehouse School of Medicine. Among her areas of exper - tise are depression and mood disorders, ADHD and disruptive disorders, and PTSD and the effects of trauma and war on family members. In November 2012, Dr. Kanawati visited Amman, Jordan, where she assessed the psychiatric needs of Syrian refugees with the support for the Syrian American Medical Society Psychosocial Support Team.

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2017 253 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYWOMEN'S COMMITTEE Reflections on Pregnancy During Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Training and Practice \"You should name him Indiana Jones!\" This was arguably the best suggestion for a baby name from one of my play therapy patients while I was pregnant during my child and adolescent psychiatry fellow - ship. My patient and I both had a love of the film adventurer and it was also clear that this child, whom I would end up seeing for nearly my entire fellowship, was genuinely excited by the news of my pregnancy. Nonetheless, I had fears that my pregnancy, and the artificial termina - tion of our therapy due to my maternity leave, would lead to increased anxiety for my patient, who had already expe - rienced abandonment by other parent figures earlier in life. Although my husband and I ultimately chose not to use Indiana Jones as a name for our first son, I always remember my patient's enthusiastic and cheerful suggestion as one of the most positive responses to my pregnancy, whether it was during my first pregnancy while in child and adolescent psychiatry fellow - ship or during my second pregnancy while working as a staff psychiatrist in a children's mental health center. The most common reaction of the child patients in my practice, after initial surprise and interest in the details of the baby (e.g., gender, due date), was to then move on and ignore it (the pregnancy/baby) until the subject naturally came up in the final sessions prior to maternity leave. Women child and adolescent psychia - trists can face particular challenges when we become pregnant in the course of our careers. Not only are we going to navigate the reactions of our child and adolescent patients to the pregnancy, but we must also experience the reactions of their parents/caregivers and of col - leagues, supervisors, and others. Some patients or their families can be quite solicitous toward pregnant psy - chiatrists, including bringing gifts for the baby. I received baby gifts from more affluent patients and also from patients whose families struggle to make ends meet each month. Do the gifts change the dynamic of the patient-physician relationship? What about when the child or parents ask if the new baby enjoys the stuffed animal or the hand knit baby blanket? Again, without flexible culture-based guidelines, my own general policy was to keep the smaller, handmade gifts and donate some of the gifts that were still in boxes, thus continuing the spirit of generosity toward another family that has greater need than my own family. Elizabeth McGuire, MD, with Diane K. Shrier, MD While I was fortunate to have mostly positive responses to both of my pregnancies, I also experienced more challenging reactions. There was the child with autism, intellectual disability, and aggressive behaviors, who became inordinately focused on my growing abdomen, to the point that he would attempt to touch it during each appoint - ment, and more than once tried to push me on my abdomen. One mother of a patient of mine suddenly became quite caring and maternal towards me, even while she continued to demonstrate abusive behavior toward her teenaged daughter. There was the young teen who herself became pregnant not long after I started showing for my second pregnancy. Despite the potential for a parallel process for us both, she ended up distancing herself over the ensu - ing weeks and months, to the point of making rude and dismissive statements to me at our last appointment before my maternity leave. During both pregnancies, I found myself increasingly aware of potential safety concerns and wanting to limit intakes for children or adolescents who had a history of significant aggression. Even an increase in emotional hostility increased my anxiety about my own safety and that of my unborn child. Psychiatry as a career path can expose us to unpredict - able individuals, and pregnancy itself can make the woman more of a target than she would be otherwise. Certainly, a practice's particular patient population may also determine the typical range of responses to a pregnant psychiatrist. How differently would child patients respond if those children come from intact families and a position of privilege versus children who have experienced trauma, poverty, immigration, hous - ing instability, and/or loss of one or both parents? Not only do we have to consider the reactions of our child patients and their \"Psychiatry as a career path can expose us to unpredictable individuals, and pregnancy itself can make the woman more of a target than she would be otherwise.\" continued on page 254254 AACAP NEWSCOMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY families to a pregnancy, but for those of us in a group practice or in a train - ing program, we also have to consider how our colleagues may respond to a pregnancy. Will our colleagues resent us for needing to take time off for maternity leave? Will colleagues be supportive and helpful as we wind down practice in anticipation of leave, or will they con - tinue to interact with us as if in denial, virtually ignoring the third person in the room - the baby? Just as pregnancy opens us up for questions from patients, it also may invite unwanted statements from other professionals regarding any aspect of our physical state, such as the size or shape of our abdomen, the weight we have gained, our energy level, or even touching our growing bellies without permission. Assumptions may be made about career-ending, post-partum plans and that the woman would be staying home and leaving the profession rather than making other child-care options. A recent informal poll in a social media post for a women psychiatrist group resulted in dozens of similar responses detailing unhelpful, critical, and incredibly personal remarks from colleagues or other staff toward women psychiatrists while they were pregnant. There remains a remarkable paucity of large-scale research that might lead to more profession-wide recommendations based on data, rather than assumptions. Since a majority of child and adoles - cent psychiatrists are women, and most women complete training and early career during their childbearing years, more research is indicated in this impor - tant area to inform policy for residency training programs and beyond. m Honor Your Mentor in the March/April issue of AACAP News In the March/April issue of AACAP News , you have the opportunity to honor your mentor(s).

Reflections on Pregnancy continued from page 251 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2017 255 2018 will mark the 20th anniversary of the AACAP Physician Scientist Program in Substance Abuse, supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Supported with funds through NIDA Career Development Award (K12) first granted to AACAP in 1998, this longstanding and successful award provides up to five years of salary sup - port, research support, and mentored addiction research training for quali - fied child and adolescent psychiatrists. Eighteen scholars completed this NIDA-AACAP program between 1998 through 2014, under the leadership of Program Directors, Bennett Leventhal, MD , of the University of California San Francisco (1998-2003) and Paula Riggs, MD , of the University of Colorado, Denver (2004-2020). Advisory Committee Chairs, Catherine Martin, MD , of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine (2004- 2014), and Kevin Gray, MD , of the Medical University of South Carolina (2015-2020) assist in the administration of the K12 program. The partnership between AACAP and NIDA is complimentary to each organi - zation as both have a shared mission to: Increase the number of child and adolescent psychiatrist investiga - tors conducting both addiction and mental health research; and Disseminate pediatric addiction research to increase scientific knowl - edge and improve clinical practice. The K12 scholars have significantly contributed to the advancement of the field of child and adolescent addiction research and clinical practice. Together, K12 scholars have contributed more than 500 publications to the scientific and clinical literature. And, subsequent to their training, this productive group has obtained more than 35 new research grants to support their research. In May 2015, AACAP received the fourth 5-year competing renewal (2015-2020) of the NIDA-AACAP K12. Six new schol - ars were selected and received their awards in 2016.Alongside Drs. Riggs and Gray, Carmen J. Head, MPH, CHES, AACAP's Director of Research, Grants & Workforce serves as the Program Administrator. Current K12 Advisory Committee members include leading researchers in substance use disorders and/or child and adoles - cent psychiatry: Dr. Leventhal, Frances 2018: The 20th Anniversary of the K12 From top to bottom, left to right: Kevin Gray, MD, David Farabee, PhD; Neal Ryan, MD, Rob Philibert, MD, PhD, Tim Wilens, MD; Catherine Martin, MD, Frances Levin, MD; Paula Riggs, MD, Program Director, Lillian Gelberg, MD, MSPH, Carmen Head, CPH;Chris Hammond, MD, PhD, Roya Ijadi-Maghsoodi, MD, Eraka Bath, MD;Allan Andersen, MD, Kara Bagot, MD, Amy Yule, MD continued on page 256 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY20th Anniversary of the K12 continued from page 255 256 AACAP NEWSCOMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY Levin, MD, Dr. Martin, and Neal Ryan, MD. Scholars' primary home institution research mentors provide year-round mentorship and participate as K12 pro - gram ;faculty during K12 annual retreats. The K12 annual retreats are held in June just prior to the College of Problems on Drug Dependence (CPDD) Annual Meeting. Retreats allow program partici - pants to come together as a community of scholars and have, over time, fostered the development of a national network of research mentors. The Annual K12 retreat took place in Montreal, Quebec, June 15-17, 2017. NIDA/AACAP scholars convened with their mentors, Dr. Riggs, and K12 Advisory Committee Members. Carmen J. Head, and AACAP's Assistant Director of Research, Training, and Education, Sarah Hellwege, MEd, also attended and were instrumental to the plan - ning and success of the retreat. The retreat program is specifically designed to develop core competencies and skills necessary to scholars' successful academic career development. Scholars received feedback and guidance on their research presentations and posters from faculty mentors, fellow scholars, and the K12 Advisory Committee. Dr. Riggs presented strategies for recruiting ado - lescent research participants and Jane B. Acri, PhD, Chief, NIDA Medication Discovery and Toxicology Branch, presented on NIDA/NIH research funding priorities, highlighting specific resources and funding opportunities for early career investigators. The scholars led and facilitated two discussion forums addressing specific challenges faced by physician investigators, such as balanc - ing clinical duties and research time. NIDA has been justly proud of AACAP's Physician Scientist Program in Substance Abuse. AACAP would like to con - gratulate AACAP's K12 scholars and looks forward to their contributions to the field. mThe six current NIDA-AACAP scholars, listed below, have demonstrated remark - able progress and academic achievement at this early stage of their career, which predicts that they will soon join their predecessors as scientific leaders in the field.

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2017 269 FOR YOUR INFORMATION 270 AACAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATION2018 Association Membership As you look to renew your dues for 2018, please join our 501(c)(6) Association , by not checking the box to opt-out on your dues invoice. As you may know, in 2013 the American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry was formed as a closely affili - ated organization of the Academy to house our advocacy efforts. Regardless of whether you opt-out of the 501(c)(6) Association, your dues will remain the same. The 501(c)(6) Association expands AACAP's government affairs and advocacy efforts by helping child and adolescent psychiatrists engage in health policy and advocacy activities that promote mentally healthy chil - dren, adolescents, families as well as the profession of child and adolescent psychiatry. The Association houses AACAP's advocacy programs. These include federal lobbying through activities like the Legislative Conference, grassroots advocacy through AACAP's Advocacy Liaison program, and AACAP-PAC. Please note that under federal law your dues dollars can never be used by AACAP-PAC to support political candidates , and membership in the Association is not the same as becoming a voluntary member of AACAP-PAC. If you check the opt-out box in the 501(c)(6) special notice, you will be prohibited from receiving the free benefits of the Association. You will not be eligible to receive the Association's resources for federal and state advocacy. Regardless of whether you opt-in or opt-out of the Association, your dues will be the same. Throughout the year, the Association holds special events and provides infor - mative updates on regulatory and policy proposals that may impact your practice, research, and patients. The Association, in tandem with the Academy, is here to provide our members with the best pos - sible service. We look forward to having your continued membership in both the Academy and the Association in 2018! mGOVERNMENT AFFAIRS & CLINICAL PRACTICE ADVOCACY IN ACTION AACAP DIRECT AND GRASSROOTS LOBBYING HELPS TO DEFEAT ACA \"REPEAL AND REPLACE\" FOUR TIMES: AACAP rallied its members this su mmer to speak out in defeating Senate Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Association also le ft its mark with timely public statements, signaling our stance to members, Congress, and the public. All told, GOP leaders tried four different legislative approaches to ACA \"repeal and repl ace.\" As AACAP continually urged, each one was rejected by over half of the Senate, as sev eral leading Republicans joined all Democrats. Our AACAP efforts, along with mos t major players in the medical and hospital community, preserved access to Essential Health Benefits cover age, including mental health and substance use disorders, as well as continued coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. AACAP TEAMS UP WITH THE OREGON COUNCIL TO D EFEAT PSYCHOLOGIST PRESCRIBING: Reversing a troubling trend in s everal other states this year, AACAP worked with the Oregon Council this summer to keep Oregon from becoming yet another state to allow ill-advise d and dangerous psycholog ist prescribing. In a thoughtful veto message by the Oregon Governor, as urged by the presidents of AACAP and the Oregon Council, child and adolescent psychiatry' s message carried the day. As a result, children, families, a nd the citizens of Oregon were protected from the enactm ent of ill-advised legislation that would have allowed other mental health professionals from being permitted to prescribe powerful psychopharmacologic medications without medical and psychiatric training.

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2017 271 FOR YOUR INFORMATIONAACAP Policy Statement Marijuana Legalization Revised Approved by Council May 2017 The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) advocates for careful consideration of potential immediate and downstream effects of marijuana policy changes on children and adolescents. Marijuana legalization, even if restricted to adults, may be associated with (a) decreased adolescent perception of marijuana's harmful effects, (b) increased marijuana use among parents and caretakers, and (c) increased adolescent access to marijuana, all of which reliably predict increased rates of adolescent marijuana use and associated problems. 1-3 Marijuana use during pregnancy, occurring at increasing rates, raises additional concerns regarding future infant, child, and adolescent development. 4-6 AACAP is aware that, among hundreds of chemical constituents, marijuana contains select individual compounds that, if safely administered in reliable doses, may potentially convey therapeutic effects for specific conditions in specific populations. 7 Advocacy regarding potential cannabinoid therapeutics, alongside social justice, public policy, and economic concerns, have contributed to marijuana policy changes. Amid these factors, AACAP remains focused on concerns regarding adolescent marijuana use. Adolescents are especially vulnerable to marijuana's many known adverse effects. 8,9 One in six adolescent marijuana users develops cannabis use disorder, a well characterized syndrome involving tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use despite significant associated impairments.10,11 Selective breeding has increased marijuana's addictive potency and potential harm to adolescents.12 Heavy use during adolescence is associated with increased incidence and worsened course of psychotic, mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders.13,14 Furthermore, marijuana's deleterious effects on adolescent cognition, behavior, and brain development may have immediate and long-term implications, including increased risk of motor vehicle accidents, sexual victimization, academic failure, lasting decline in intelligence measures, psychopathology, addiction, and psychosocial and occupational impairment. 8,13-16 Marijuana-related policy changes, including legalization, may have significant unintended consequences for children and adolescents. AACAP supports (a) initiatives to increase awareness of marijuana's harmful effects on adolescents, (b) improved access to evidence-based treatment for adolescents with marijuana-related problems, and (c) careful monitoring of the effects of marijuana-related policy changes on child and adolescent mental health. Finally, AACAP strongly advocates for the involvement of the medical and research community in these critical and highly impactful policy-related discussions. 1.

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2017 273 FOR YOUR INFORMATION POLICY STATEMENTS Policy Statement Procedures \u00bbOnce a final draft policy statement is submitted by an individual author(s) or body (e.g., component or Assembly) to the Policy Statement Advisory Group (PSAG) via the National Office, the Policy Statement Advisory Group Chair directs that: the author(s) is told what major revisions or minor edits are necessary. After the author(s) has revised the statement, they may resubmit to the PSAG; OR The author(s) is informed that the statement does not meet the criteria for a policy statement. \u00bbIf the PSAG recommends it, the Executive Committee reviews the statement to decide whether it should be e-mailed to Council or placed on Council's meeting agenda. If the Executive Committee decides not to advance the statement, the author(s) may be contacted to resolve the issue(s). \u00bbIf emailed, Council members have a two-week discussion period in which to convey concerns and ask questions. After this period, a one-week voting period begins. \u00bbIf Council approves the statement, the author(s) is notified. The statement is printed in AACAP News and distributed to the recommended sources then placed on the AACAP website. \u00bbIf Council does not approve the statement, the author(s) may be requested to rewrite and resubmit to the PSAG with an explanation of what changed. \u00bbEvery two years, the PSAG reviews all policy statements for necessary revisions or updates. Revisions are made by the original author(s), if available, or by known specialists in that area of expertise. The revising author(s) is given a 3-month period to make changes and resubmit to the PSAG for final approval. \u00bbAnnually, committee chairs are asked to review policy statements online and update if necessary. AACAP Policy Statement Requirements Policies should: 1) be a statement regarding an important policy issue, 2) be a well-written statement, as brief as possible, 3) identify the target audience, 4) have the potential of having some specific impact, and 5) include ideas for distribution. Platitudinous statements supporting \"Apple Pie and Motherhood\" or condemning the multitude of actions, behaviors, social events, or cultural patterns which may have some negative effect on children and families are not likely to serve the AACAP well and may, ultimately, undermine the credibility of AACAP efforts in other areas. The final draft policy statement should be submitted by the author(s) or body (e.g., component or Assembly) to the Policy Statement Advisory Committee via the National Office . In formulating the policy statement, the authors should keep in mind the criteria as stated above. Statement must include ideas for distribution. If the author(s) wishes to have the statement reviewed by the next Executive Committee or Council, they must have the draft statement to the National Office eight weeks in advance.e f *revised 10/2012274 AACAP NEWS 274 AACAP NEWSThank You for Supporting AACAP!
