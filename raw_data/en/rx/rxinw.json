Wear ear protectors and protect yourself from heat exhaustion in the laundry room. - Be alert for hidden sharps. - Never shake out laundry. Hold soiled laundry away from your body to avoid contaminating your clothing.

Don't put it down on any surface. Place wet laundry in leak proof bags. Bag contaminated laundry at the location of use.
