These may include homeopathy, nutritional medicine, herbal medicine, massage therapy and lifestyle and dietary advice. Inherent to naturopathy is the principle that the body has an intrinsic ability to heal itself. Using the healing power of nature and gentle therapeutic techniques, the mind, body and emotions are supported during this healing process. The word \"naturopathy\" comes from the Latin word for birth\u2014natura\u2014and the Greek root word for suffering\u2014pathos. They combine to create \"natural healing\", which is the basis for naturopathy. The Greek physician Hippocrates is believed to be the very first person to practice naturopathy, with the modern version being traced back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Back then, they included hydrotherapy which was practised in Germany, and \"nature cure\" which used elements of air, light, foods, herbs, and water to treat illnesses, and was developed in Austria. The practice was first introduced in the USA in 1901 by Benedict Lust. It promoted an alternative to conventional medicine through the use of herbal medicine, homeopathy, and dietary recommendations, as a way to promote natural healing. Its emphasis on freedom of choice and individual responsibility helped it to become popular throughout the world, including a steady following in Australia. Today, naturopaths are licensed primary care providers who provide a variety of health-promoting treatments. Naturopathy is a broad practice that encompasses a number of other natural therapies, including: These therapies involve a large variety of methods and techniques that may be used by a naturopath, including: Naturopathy has proven to help with a number of health concerns, including: There can be some degree of crossover with certain natural therapies, which can be confusing at times. Because naturopathy encompasses a number of other natural therapies like homeopathy, nutrition, and herbal medicine, it can be considered a much broader practice where the naturopath can help with a larger number of issues. By contrast, a herbalist can only help with herbal medicines, and a nutritionist with nutrition. ANTA is committed to the delivery of public safety, quality health care and promoting informed choices. This is reflected in our [Scope and Standards of Practice](https://www.australiannaturaltherapistsassociation.com.au/resources/business-information/standards-of-practice/).

If you would like to find a naturopath yourself, these are the main things to look out for: Often, a naturopath will start the appointment by getting a holistic understanding of your health. This may include talking about your medical history, stress, diet, lifestyle, bowel habits, and any health issues you're currently having. They might also chat to you about your emotional well being, how much sleep you get each night, and your general energy levels each day. Finally, they may complete a physical assessment. All of this information gives them a good understanding of your general health, which allows them to create a custom treatment plan for you, which allows your body to naturally heal. The plan may include recommendations such as detoxifying your body, making changes to your diet, taking nutritional supplements, and more. Naturopaths aim to teach you about how to stay in good health, so they will provide you with plenty of good information to do so. They may also suggest follow-up appointments, although this depends on your specific treatment plan. Our naturopaths are well-trained at integrating conventional medicines with natural medicines in terms of your specific health concerns. However, if you are currently taking medications administered by a GP, you should let them know you are also using alternative medicine, and continue taking those medications unless they advise otherwise. It may also be possible for us to work alongside your GP to ensure the proper monitoring and assessment of our natural medicines takes place during your treatment plan. ANTA represents naturopaths with a broad range of skills, including helping you to have a baby. When you find a naturopath through our directory, be sure to enquire about their experience with fertility. A change in your symptoms all depends on your age, your overall vitality, the severity of your symptoms and how long you have had your health condition. Some clients start to feel results within a couple of days, for others, it will take a few weeks or even longer. It's also important to note that, unlike pharmaceutical medications, natural remedies aren't a quick-fix solution. They work on healing the body over time and involve working towards a long-term solution to your health problems. Naturopaths will work with you to create a plan that involves \"real-life\" recommendations to help you lose weight at a consistent and steady pace. This will involve making nutritional recommendations and teaching you the principles of healthy eating so you can develop a healthy relationship with food and a happier, healthier body.
