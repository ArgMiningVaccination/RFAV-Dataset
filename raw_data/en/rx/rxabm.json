Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ) is dedicated to building a legacy of safe, high-quality patient care and it's our employees who play the most sizable role in shaping the way we deliver care. We greatly value their feedback and regularly ask for it, then use this information to learn where we might have opportunities to make improvements and understand how we can further empower them by providing the necessary tools to perform their jobs. It is because of this type of collaborative work environment between leadership and staff that we were selected as one of 100 organizations nationwide to make Modern Healthcare's \"Best Places to Work in Healthcare for 2015\" list. RWJ was also the only hospital in New Jersey to be recognized. What makes this honor especially meaningful is that the recognition is driven greatly by feedback and input from our staff. Our efforts in employee engagement have been purposeful. Knowing this is a key area of focus for RWJ as we transition from volume to value-based care, means we will strive to maintain our current level of engagement and look to identify new ways to gain more of it. RWJ was also selected by Becker's Hospital Review as one of the \"100 Hospitals and Health Systems with Great Oncology Programs.\" It's important to point out that this honor is the result of our great partnerships in cancer care with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and our physicians in the community. Examples of this collaborative care are highlighted throughout the stories we share with you in this magazine. I now invite you to enjoy another exciting issue of Breakthroughs. Sincerely, Stephen K.

Shown: Michelle Jones (right), 23, of Spotswood, has epilepsy and was unable to live a normal life, constantly worrying about when her next seizure might strike. She relied heavily on friends and family every day, most notably her Mom Nancy (left). Today, they are thankful for the team of experts from the neurosciences program at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at RWJ who performed a groundbreaking procedure to stop Ms. Jones' seizures. 1NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSETThe 23-year-old Spotswood resident and Rutgers University student constantly lived in fear of seizures which could place her in harm's way while participating in the most basic activities. Living with epilepsy meant that she couldn't do many things alone or go on trips with friends. She couldn't drive and she had to notify her professors about her condition so she could receive help if she had a seizure in class. \"Not being able to drive was a real struggle for me. I was robbed of my independence and couldn't live a full life,\" she said. \"I felt I would never experience the freedom to go about my own routine.\" Despite her diagnosis, Ms. Jones tried to lead a normal life. \"I had my first job at age 14 and I tried my best to not let it interfere with what I wanted to do,\" Ms. Jones said. Now, thanks to the expert care she received from Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ) and Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School's Clinical Neurophysiology and Epilepsy Center and Neurosurgery teams, Ms. Jones is driving, attending classes and pursuing a degree in communications. She is among the hundreds of individuals who have benefitted from laser ablation technology. Laser ablation is a new minimally-invasive technology that uses light energy to target the area of the brain that causes epileptic seizures. Laser energy is delivered to the target area through a probe that is directed through a three-millimeter hole in the base of the skull. As light is delivered through the probe, temperatures in the target area rise, destroying unwanted tissue and leaving healthy tissue unharmed. The National Association of Epilepsy Centers has designated RWJ as a Level IV Epilepsy Center. The hospital is a national leader in laser ablation, having performed more procedures than any other institution to treat a broad range of conditions such as brain tumors, chronic pain and epilepsy. RWJ has trained nearly 100 surgeons in the technology's use. Signs of Ms. Jones' epilepsy surfaced at age 11. \"For the first two years I felt auras or what I called 'moments', (preludes to epileptic seizures),\" she recalled. Her diagnosis wasn't confirmed until she experienced a full-blown seizure while on vacation in Florida with her mother and sisters. \"While in bed, her legs began to move and the movement went up her body to her arms. She began to make strange noises,\" her mother, Nancy Jones, said. \"Blood was coming out of her mouth.\" After returning home, she was eventually referred to Syed Hosain, MD, Clinical Professor of Pediatric Neurology and Section Chief, Clinical Neurophysiology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at RWJ. Dr. Hosain managed Ms. Jones' condition with medication for many years, but cautioned she would need surgery in the future. \"Michelle was apprehensive about having surgery, but her seizures grew more severe,\" said Shabbar Danish, MD, Chief of Neurosurgical Oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and Director of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, who performed Ms. Jones' surgery. \"Laser ablation is minimally-invasive surgery. We have done more than 200 procedures, so we have a good sense of our safety profile.\" There were no complications following the procedure and Ms. Jones returned home within 24 hours. She has been seizure-free for more than a year. \"One year is a significant milestone and two years is major,\" Dr. Hosain noted. \"Patients remaining seizure-free two years out have a 90-95 percent chance of remaining seizure-free for the rest of their lives.\" Laser ablation technology wasn't available when Ms. Jones was first diagnosed. Delaying surgery may have paid off. \"Everything I have done after surgery feels like a first-time experience,\" Ms. Jones said. \"I am finally able to experience a greater quality of life. It's an amazing feeling.\" 2Shown: Syed Hosain, MD, (left) Clinical Professor of Pediatric Neurology and Section Chief, Clinical Neurophysiology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at RWJ, has cared for and medically managed Ms. Jones' epilepsy for 10 years.

Mrs. Alden was one of the first patients to have a 3D mammogram at the Steeplechase Cancer Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset. The new, state-of-the-art, advanced imaging system enables doctors to diagnose tumors more clearly and accurately. 3BREAST CANCER Digital Mammograms Diagnosed with breast cancer in June, Mary Alden says she feels \"lucky.\" NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSETsteeplechase cancer center support programs: ___________________ Look Good, Feel Better Monday, February 15 10 a.m. to 12 noon In Partnership with American Cancer Society ___________________ Wigs and Accessories T uesdays, January 19 and March 15 1 to 3 p.m. In Partnership with American Cancer Society ___________________ Call 1-888-MD-RWJUH 4\"Lucky\" because she was one of the first patients at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset (RWJ Somerset) to have a 3D mammogram, part of the comprehensive care provided at the Sanofi US Breast Care Program at the Steeplechase Cancer Center. This new, state-of-the-art technology helped radiologists diagnose the lump - which was only 1centimeter in size and was too small to feel - as stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma. Because it was found in its earliest stage, it had not spread to the lymph nodes. Mrs. Alden, 61, of Ringoes, was able to have a breast-conserving lumpectomy to remove the cancer, rather than a mastectomy to remove the entire breast. \"When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer, it was a time of high anxiety and fear,\" Mrs. Alden said. \"After learning that the type of breast cancer I had was able to be treated and cured, I felt very lucky that my breast cancer was detected in early stage 1. My mother underwent a double mastectomy for breast cancer.\" She is now undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment at the Steeplechase Cancer Center as well as hormone therapy to prevent the cancer from coming back. Her radiologist Myra Wedmid, MD, Co-Director of the Sanofi US Breast Care Program, said Mrs. Alden's lesion didn't look suspicious on a 2D image, but on the 3D mammography it was \"very obvious\" that the mass was abnormal. \"It's possible by the time it showed up on a standard mammography, it would have been a larger lesion,\" she said. \"3D mammography detects more invasive breast cancers than standard mammography because it provides clearer images and more accurately shows the size and shape of abnormalities. It gives me more confidence as a radiologist in determining whether something looks cancerous or benign.\" 3D mammogram, also known as a digital breast tomosynthesis exam, moves in an arc over the breasts to capture multiple images of the breast from various angles that create a clear, 3D reconstruction of the breast, which allows radiologists to examine the patient's breast tissue in far greater detail. By picking up invasive tumors and abnormalities more easily, it helps increase accuracy and avoids false alarms. \"3D mammography is much more accurate and finds more cancers,\" said Mrs. Alden's oncologist Kathleen Toomey, MD, who is the Medical Director of the Steeplechase Cancer Center. \"Because it is better at finding cancer, it helps avoid unnecessary tests and biopsies that women don't need which can lead to unnecessary fear and anxiety.\" \"The 3D mammography was definitely beneficial for me,\" said Mrs. Alden. \"I would never get a mammogram without 3D.\" As part of her recovery, she has participated in support and education programs at the Steeplechase Cancer Center, including \"Look Good, Feel Better\" and \"Wigs and Accessories\" classes. She plans to return to work as a network technician for Verizon, where she has worked for 28 years. She and her husband, James, also enjoy going on cruises and spending time with their two grandchildren. \"I am so grateful to Dr. Wedmid and her staff who were able to detect my cancer in the earliest stages when it was curable,\" she said. \"Now I am looking forward to getting on with life.\" Visit www.rwjmammo.com or call 1-888-MD-RWJUH .

Shown: Triplets Kieran Allen Eng, Grayson Logan Eng and Colton Banner Eng were delivered safely at 25 weeks and spent three months in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ). The advanced care and multi-specialty support available only at a Regional Perinatal Center like RWJ is what has the nearly one-year-olds thriving today. 5NEONATOLOGY Three's Company Last January, Susan Yu-Eng delivered 25-week-old triplets at the Regional Perinatal Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ). 6As they prepared for delivery, Mrs. Yu-Eng and her husband David Eng were mindful of the odds against the babies they had struggled to conceive and fought to bring close to term. With strong support from the medical team - including the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Group, the hospital's Labor & Delivery and Maternity Services, and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital (BMSCH) at RWJ - the couple maintained faith that the family's journey wouldn't end that day. \"I was panicked. At 25 weeks, the babies' chance of survival still wasn't great and babies that do survive could have a chronic illness,\" Mrs. Yu-Eng remembered. \"RWJ saved our kids.\" Looking at Colton Banner, Grayson Logan and Kieran Allen Eng nearly a year later, it's hard to believe that each infant weighed less than two pounds and measured just 12 inches at birth. The Engs' \"superhero\" babies spent three months in the NICU before going home. Their youngest, Kieran, additionally spent several weeks in rehabilitation at Children's Specialized Hospital before being sent home in July. Their journey was never easy. The Engs married in 2010 and soon tried to expand their family. They experienced a couple of miscarriages and two failed in vitro fertilization (IVF) attempts. With expert medical care from Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey, they gave IVF one last try. They were successful; in fact, one of two embryos implanted split and Mrs. Yu-Eng was pregnant with triplets. Todd Rosen, MD, Chief of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, provided care throughout Mrs. Yu-Eng's pregnancy. It was uneventful, until 23 weeks. During a routine ultrasound, the technician noticed Mrs. Eng was having contractions. She didn't feel them and had no idea she had started to dilate. As a result, Mrs. Yu-Eng was admitted to RWJ and delivery seemed imminent. Fortunately, her contractions were stopped. She stayed at RWJ for a week then was discharged to spend New Year's Day at home. She continued to rest at home until January 7th, when once again, contractions started and sent her back to RWJ. Then, at 25 weeks, her boys were delivered via emergency caesarean section. The couple was impressed by the choreographed response in the delivery room, where each baby had a dedicated team consisting of a physician, nurses, and a respiratory therapist ready at his cart. Colton arrived first and Grayson was next. Kieran joined them three minutes later. All three immediately went to the NICU. \"At first you're just happy that they're breath - ing and moving, but then there's 'What now?'\" Mr. Eng recalled. \"All we could do then was put our trust in the doctors, the nurses and everyone who'd care for them. It was very apparent that they love and care for these babies like they would their own kids.\" Thomas Hegyi, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, said the boys were born with issues common in premature babies, including respiratory distress syndrome and feeding intolerance, and they were at risk for chronic heart and brain conditions. \"The beauty of our field is that time is on our side. As babies grow and mature, the diseases, although they may take a while to resolve, will resolve,\" he said. The Eng are grateful to the entire NICU team, especially their nurses, who explained the medical jargon and provided hands-on instruction on how to properly use and monitor equipment to continue care at home. David Sorrentino, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and Chief of the Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Medical Director of the NICU at BMSCH commends the team's family- centered approach. \"NICU stays can be incredibly traumatic for parents. We recognize that stress, and while we get even better at infant care, we're also expanding the scope of care to improving communication with parents. They're an essential part of the equation,\" he said. The triplets continue to see specialists - a gastroenterologist, an ophthalmologist, a cardiologist and a urologist, to name a few - Shown: David Sorrentino, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and Chief of the Division of Neonatal- Perinatal Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Medical Director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital (BMSCH) at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, led the comprehensive team of physicians, nurses and staff who took part in caring for Colton, Grayson and Kieran Eng when they arrived at just 25 weeks old. but Mrs. Yu-Eng feels like the biggest hurdles are over. \"It can be tough, but we couldn't imagine not having them here,\" she said. \"We thank RWJ for that.\" Visit www.bmsch.org/nicu or call 1-888-MD-RWJUH.

Ms. Kelly chose to come to RWJ Somerset for her surgery after hearing about its Joint Surgery Center from her sister who lives in Whitehouse Station. The program has received the Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval for total knee and total hip replacement surgery. Its comprehensive approach to care includes a nurse who serves as a joint care coordina - tor, pre-surgery education and physical and occupational therapy services that begin the day of your surgery. Most patients are able to go directly home from the hospital after a two-day stay. \"Every aspect of my quick recovery depended on everyone working as a team to meet my needs,\" Ms. Kelly said. From the registrar and anesthesiologist to the nurses, phlebotomist and housekeeper, everyone was compassionate and caring, she said. \"They don't treat you like a patient. You're a person to them,\" she said. \"They don't treat you like a number.\" She was especially touched by the little things such as the flower that was put on her breakfast tray each morning and the ability to wear her own clothes - not a hospital gown- while she recovered. As she walked the halls each day as part of her therapy, staff smiled and cheered her on. Kyala Pascual, RN, joint care coordinator, came to check on her every morning to see how she was doing. \"We are very patient-centered,\" Ms. Pascual said. \"We adjust everything to meet the patient's needs and abilities. We know that no two patients are exactly alike.\" While most patients have only one joint replaced at a time, Ms. Kelly was an ideal candidate for bilateral hip replacement, said her orthopedic surgeon Thomas Nordstrom, MD. \"Both of her hips were in terrible shape,\" Dr. Nordstrom said. \"If we fixed one, but she couldn't walk on the other, it would still have been tough for her to get around. I felt she would do better and have a faster recovery doing both hips the same day rather than do one and wait three months to do the other.\" Patients undergoing bilateral joint surgery face risks associated with increased blood loss and longer time under anesthesia. They are also at increased risk for infections and blood clots. However, because Ms. Kelly was only 58, thin and in good health with no other chronic health issues, Dr. Nordstrom felt the benefits outweighed the risks of operating on both hips at once. \"This has opened up a new chapter for me,\" Ms. Kelly said. \"My hips are wonderful. I am able to go down stairs without even thinking about it and I am no longer dependent on others for help.\" Months after her surgery, she still couldn't stop talking about her gratitude for the team Shown above: Thomas Nordstrom, MD, orthopedic surgeon at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, performed Ms. Kelly's bilateral double hip replacement. at the Joint Surgery Center at RWJ Somerset. \"I am so thankful to everyone.

JOINT SURGERY CENTER JOINT SURGERY CENTER Shown: Allen Ross is living a healthier, more active life, thanks to the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Program at The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. After a rigorous screening process that includes family and psychological evaluations, Mr. Ross underwent bariatric surgery and to date has lost 135 pounds. He also noticed improvements in other conditions sometimes caused by obesity, like asthma. 13BARIATRIC SURGERY Guiding Adolescents T o Healthier Lives Allen Ross of North Plainfield was 365 pounds and borderline diabetic - at the age of 17. He was running out of options. 14\"I've had weight problems as far back as I can remember,\" Mr. Ross said. \"Physical activity was tough because I had really bad asthma. Some asthma medication has steroids, and that packs on the pounds, too.\" Mr. Ross had tried different diets and exercise programs to lose weight and was told that he may have to be admitted to a hospital where he could be monitored if a solution couldn't be found. However, his problems weren't just physical. \"My social life was non-existent,\" Mr. Ross said. \"The only time I ever socialized was at school. I always kept to myself and became an introvert.\" Because Mr. Ross had a body mass index of 50 and had tried to lose weight over an extended period, he became a candidate for adolescent bariatric surgery at The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital (BMSCH) at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ). This program is the world's first designated Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence for Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery as designated by the international Surgical Review Corporation. Adolescents must meet specific criteria and follow a structured program to be considered for surgery. Mr. Ross entered the program and was evaluated by a team of specialists, including a pediatrician, nutritionist, dietitian, cardiologist, pulmonologist, gastroenterologist and psychologist. He began working with Kimberly Brennan, RN, CBN, and a certified bariatric nurse and Bariatric Program Manager at RWJ and BMSCH. A bariatric surgery patient herself, Ms. Brennan screens candidates, coordinates pre-operative educa - tion, and leads support group meetings. \"People who have the best outcomes have a specific lifestyle plan in mind,\" Ms. Brennan said. \"Allen was great about following our program, researching the lifestyle changes he would need to make, and discussing everything with his family.\" Ragui Sadek, MD, FACS, and Medical Director of the Bariatric Surgery Program at RWJ and BMSCH, performed a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on Mr. Ross. Unlike other weight loss surgeries, this procedure doesn't create malabsorption or significant vitamin deficiency, and it feels more natural to patients. More than a year after his surgery, Mr. Ross has lost 135 pounds and continues to closely follow his nutritional and exercise program. But the changes Mr. Ross sees extend far beyond the scale and mirror. \"My life has done a complete 180,\" Mr. Ross said. \"I'm more social, more talkative. There's no more bullying or people talking behind my back. I can run around with my nieces and nephews. I can't remember the last time I used my inhaler, and my blood levels are in the normal range.\" A key component of the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Program at BMSCH is teaching patients to become leaders. This gives kids more confidence and allows them to focus on something besides weight. Leadership is a role that Mr. Ross has embraced. \"We've found that leaders have the most success in our program,\" Ms. Brennan said. \"Our patients help me teach other adolescents about what to expect before and after surgery. When Mr. Ross speaks to our support group, the kids are entranced and ask a lot of questions.\" Now 18, Mr. Ross's desire to help others won't stop there. The 2015 graduate of North Plainfield High School has bigger plans. \"I'm going to college to become a nurse,\" Mr. Ross said. \"I've always been in hospitals, and my mom was a nurse, so nurses have been a big influence in my life. I appreciate all of the support I've received, so it's important to me to become a nurse.\" Dr. Sadek had the global medical community buzzing when he delivered a presentation about the RWJ and BMSCH programs at the recent International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders event in Vienna, Austria. He believes more organizations will follow the RWJ model, and hopes the program's success will lead to a larger conversation about a serious issue. \"We need to talk openly about how to treat morbidly obese teenagers who have serious psychological, social and physical health issues,\" Dr. Sadek said. \"Many children have suicidal tendencies because of bullying and discrimination. We have to expose what these kids go through and offer a comprehensive program to help them. Bariatric surgery is a viable option that should be considered.\" Visit www.rwjuh.edu/bariatrics or call 1-888-MD-RWJUH Shown: Ragui Sadek, MD (left), Medical Director, runs the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence at The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, the only certified program of its kind in the country. INNOVATIONS BARIATRIC SURGERY WITHOUT THE SURGERY Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital is a certified Center of Excellence in Bariatric Surgery and strives to provide the safest, most advanced and efficient quality care for all our patients. This Managed Weight Loss System is now offered in RWJ New Brunswick for adults with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 to 40 who have attempted more conservative weight reduction alternatives. What is it? ORBERA is a soft, yet durable Intragastric, silicone balloon How does it work? In a non-surgical procedure typically done under a mild sedative, the thin and deflated balloon is placed into the stomach. It is then filled with saline until it's about the size of a grapefruit. The procedure normally takes about 20-30 minutes and people can generally go home the same day. o Once the balloon is in place, the 12-month coaching program begins. o At six months, the balloon is removed in the same way it was placed. Through a non-surgical procedure done under a mild sedative, it is deflated and then removed. How is it doing? Data collected in the U.S. clinical trial has shown the average person lost 3.1 times the weight as compared with diet and exercise alone within six months. Shown: Karl Schumacher, 40, of Manville, is the perfect example of how important timely response and treatment is when it comes to cardiovascular care. Thanks to the quick thinking and reactions of all Mr. Schumacher's providers, from EMTs to the Cath Lab at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, he is healthy and home spending time with his boys, Jonathan (left) and Damian (right). 15CARDIAC CARE Timing is Everything Karl Schumacher's 40th birthday party in September was more than just a celebration of an important milestone but a celebration of life.NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET16Thirteen nieces and nephews ran around the backyard of his Manville home on a warm Saturday afternoon, eating candy and a Star-Trek themed birthday cake. \"I'm thrilled I turned 40. I'm healthy,\" said Mr. Schumacher, a stay-at-home father of two boys. In April, Mr. Schumacher suffered a seizure and a heart attack while at the Fullerton Ford Dealership in Somerville with his wife, Kristina. The Bridgewater Police Department and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital's Mobile Health Services responded to a 9-1-1 call from a dealership employee. Paramedics began CPR and used an automatic defibrillator to restart his heart. He was transported to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset's (RWJ Somerset) Emergency Department where he was evaluated by Robert Van Vokenburgh, MD, an emergency medicine physician. Tests showed a blockage in Mr. Schumacher's artery and he was immediately sent to the hospital's Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where cardiologist Saleem Husain, MD, inserted a small mesh wire, called a stent, to open his blocked artery. The goal is to perform an emergency angioplasty within 60 minutes of a heart attack patient arriving at the hospital to minimize damage to the heart, Dr. Husain said. After the procedure, Mr. Schumacher's body temperature was lowered and he was given sedatives as part of a process called therapeutic hypothermia. \"This procedure has been shown to increase survival rates and minimize brain damage in patients resuscitated after a cardiac arrest,\" explained Dr. Husain. \"The patient is kept in a moderately cooled state for 24 hours before the body is gradually rewarmed and sedatives are reduced to assess the patient's neurological function.\" Mr. Schumacher's care in the Critical Care Unit was overseen by a team of intensivists, who are specialists in critical care medicine. Neurologist M. Farrukh Nizam, MD, also consulted on the case because Mr. Schumacher had sustained neurological injuries from a previous accident. After a week in the hospital, Mr. Schumacher returned home. \"His successful recovery is a testament to the quick response of the entire team,\" said Dr. Husain. \"It is important to get everybody involved as quickly as possible to get the best outcomes.\" Although he had not had any previous heart problems, Mr. Schumacher was at risk for a heart attack due to smoking and stress. But his sudden heart attack at age 39 was a shock. \"Nobody could have predicted it,\" said Mrs. Schumacher. \"It was out of the blue. It was like a storm out of nowhere.\" She credits the RWJ Somerset team of paramedics, physicians and nurses with saving her husband's life. \"RWJ Somerset made it possible for him to get back to his family,\" she said. Mr. Schumacher returned home with limited use of his left arm and hand. He had sustained nerve damage in his arm from a previous accident and his lack of mobility in the hospital caused further damage. He has been undergoing physical therapy at RWJ Somerset for his arm, which has helped him resume normal activities such as dressing himself, tying his shoes and writing. He has also been undergoing cardiac rehabilitation at the hospital to regain his strength and has quit smoking. \"It was a life-changing event for me,\" Mr. Schumacher said. He is happy to be able to pick up his 5 and 7-year-old sons from school each day, take them to parks, play in the backyard and watch New York Giants football games together. In January, he will resume studies to complete his master's degree in business administration from the Keller Graduate School of Management at DeVry University and plans to take his CPA exam next year. \"It really was a miracle that God and RWJ said Mr. Shumacher's mother-in-law Edie Sylvester,Shown: Cardiologist Saleem Husain, MD, knew the importance of performing an emergency angioplasty within 60 minutes of Mr. Schumacher's arrival to the hospital to minimize any further damage to his heart. a registered nurse at the hospital. \"He is walking and talking and able to be a husband and a father to his two children.\" Visit www.rwjheart.com or call 1-888-MD-RWJUH Shown: Efrain Ortiz, 52, of Edison, was able to take advantage of a recently launched program at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital that is designed to improve the quality of care provided to medically underserved and uninsured populations with the goal of reducing frequent and costly hospital readmissions. 17AFTER HOSPITAL CARE A World of Difference Even though he served as a field medic in the United States Army, Efrain Ortiz admits that he didn't like to take medicine or go to the doctor for check-ups. NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSETIt was this resistance combined with a poor diet and long hours at work that landed the 52-year-old Edison resident in the hospital following a heart attack. \"I am from a Puerto Rican family and we fry everything,\" Mr. Ortiz explained. \"I was working long hours, so I would eat a big, heavy meal when I came home at night and then go to bed. It wasn't good for me.\" When Mr. Ortiz experienced the classic signs of a heart attack: chest pressure, nausea and dizziness, he was rushed to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ) where doctors inserted three stents to open his blocked arteries. He needed two cholesterol-lowering medications to reduce the risk of a second heart attack when he returned home from RWJ. However, there was one problem: the medicines cost more than $400 for a monthly supply. Mr. Ortiz's health insurance didn't cover the cost and he couldn't afford them. Thankfully for Mr. Ortiz, RWJ had launched a Care Transitions Program in November 2014 as part of the New Jersey Department of Health's Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program (DSRIP) initiative to address problems exactly like his. The program is designed to improve the quality of care provided to medically underserved and uninsured populations with the goal of reducing frequent and costly hospital readmissions. RWJ's program addresses the needs of low-income Medicaid and charity care patients. It has expanded to include uninsured patients, all of whom have a diagnosis that may place them at high risk for readmission. Each day, the team, which includes a director of care transitions, social worker, performance improvement coordinator and administrative assistant with support from pharmacy, nursing, information systems and finance, receives a report generated by the hospital's patient electronic information management system about patients who recently arrived and who may be good candidates for enrollment. Candidates are evaluated based on the LACE scoring system, which factors in past and potential length-of-stay associated with the patient's condition, severity of their illness upon admission, co-morbidities and number of emergency department visits the patient has made during the past 6 months. Other issues such as lack of a primary care p rovider, inability to afford medications, homelessness and lack of transportation to keep appointments are also noted. According to Andrew Thomas, APN, Director of Care Transitions at RWJ, the DSRIP serves as a bridge for underserved or uninsured patients between the time they are discharged and the point when they access a primary care physician for a follow-up visit. During the \"bridge\" period, staff coordinates follow-up appointments for patients, links them to programs or funds that help pay for their essential life-sustaining medications, and begins the process of enrolling the patient in Medicaid (if eligible). In Mr. Ortiz's case, Mr. Thomas and his team sought an alternative to his costly prescription. \"We had the doctors change his prescription to what was essentially the same drug, but much cheaper,\" Mr. Thomas explained. \"We also enrolled him in a prescription discount program and connected him with a primary care physician and cardiologist for follow-up care.\" Shown above: Andrew Thomas, APN, Director of Care Transitions at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, assisted Mr. Ortiz through DSRIP, which serves as a bridge for underserved or uninsured patients between the time they are discharged and the point when they access a primary care physician for a follow-up visit. 18 Mr. Ortiz credits Mr. Thomas and the doctors at RWJ with saving his life. Not only did they get him the medications he needed, they counseled him on making lifestyle changes. At the time of his heart attack, he weighed 268 pounds. Today, Mr. Ortiz is down to 190 pounds thanks to a daily exercise routine and healthy diet. \"Andrew has always been there for me,\" Mr. Ortiz said. \"If it wasn't for him, I would be six feet under.\" The health care model as providers once knew it is changing, with care extending into individuals' homes. \"I truly believe this may be the only way we can move the needle to provide safe, effective and efficient care while reducing health care costs,\" Mr. Thomas said.

The screenings were co-sponsored by the hospital and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey.
