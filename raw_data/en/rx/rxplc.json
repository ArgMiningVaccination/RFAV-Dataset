Our practices respectfully reference Japanese Acupuncture, Indian Ayurveda, Scandinavian Bathing Culture, and Traditional Chinese Medicine. We are pleased to provide more information about those for your knowledge below. Methodologies & Traditions Holistic Care Holistic Care takes direct cues from your whole self- body, mind, and spirit. Holistic treatments can remedy areas of concern long before serious ailments manifest. Acupuncture Acupuncture stimulates the nervous system to elicit a healing response from the brain, helping to reduce inflammation and pain, reduce stress and promoting physical and mental well-being. Kiiko Style Acupuncture This Japanese lineage of acupuncture that is traditionally taught from master to student, uses hands on palpation of the abdomen, neck and feet for deep assessment of the energetic imbalances in the body. Gentle acupuncture is then used in specific areas to direct healing within the body for lasting results that are felt immediately. Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) understands that disease states are due to obstructed energy that distracts the body from healing itself. TCM practices remove obstructions in order to restore the body's vital energy. TCM uses acupuncture to balance \"yin\" and \"yang\" so that \"qi\" (body energy) can flow freely. The body system is built on energy pathways called meridians. Each body system utilizes its own meridian, providing points of access for your acupuncturist to guide your body to health. Think of meridians as your body's highways for its energy, and the points as pit stops. Ayurveda Ayurveda is a whole-body healing system developed in India more than 3,000 years ago. According to Ayurveda, each individual is composed of the five fundamental elements: Space, Air, Fire, Water and Earth. These elements uniquely combine within each one of us, creating a distinct and unique blueprint also known as our Dosha. There are 3 main Doshas: Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Knowing your Dosha will help you determine the best lifestyle choices that will offer optimal wellness for your mind, body and spirit. Ayurvedic rituals involve warm herbal oils that seep into the skin, restoring balance and harmony to the body and mind. Functional Phytotherapy The body has the knowledge, our practitioners are trained to listen. This therapy works directly with a biofeedback from your body's nervous system to identify specific areas of body imbalance and dis-ease. A full body scan is used to assess where stress is held in the body. Once we isolate areas-in-need, we are able to formulate the exact nutritional and herbal protocols and dosages that your body craves in real time with muscle reflex tests. You leave with custom-tailored botanical formulas designed to restore your system to its most natural, healthy state. The Den Method Our bodies know how to heal themselves, when provided with the essential building blocks of nutrition and when sources of external stressors are removed. Our bodies are constantly striving to regenerate and detoxify, our role is to help to clear the way for that internal wisdom to unfold. Our unique methodology combines the two biofeedback therapies of Kiiko Style Acupuncture and Functional Phytotherapy for a natural approach that helps to remove stress from the body and improve your capacity to heal. Recommended follow-up appointments keep a watchful eye on your progress. Bathing Rituals From Nordic hot spring soaks to Russian banyas and Japanese onsens, bathing culture has strong roots around the world. Bathing aids in muscle and mental relaxation and deepens healing. We integrate the healing powers of water with dosha specific healing remedies that include coconut milk, botanicals, flowers and essential oils that absorb into the skin to help you to regain balance within the body, mind and spirit. Reflexology Reflexology has strong historical roots in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This ancient practice focuses on treating specific points in the feet to address other parts of the body. Our bodies' energy pathways are an extensive map that connect through the entire nervous system. Opening the pathways with small, massage-like movements can alleviate pain, stimulate the immune system, and aid the lymphatic system.The use of these organ points can also be used as a tool to target any stressed out or impaired systems that need support. Using reflexology points can be a therapeutic relief of ailments (think headaches, stress and anxiety) while simultaneously feeling incredibly relaxing. Foot Soaking The practice of foot soaking allows energy to move through vital channels that flow from the foot through the entire body. If you have ever rubbed garlic on your feet, you will know that within 20 minutes you will taste that garlic in your mouth. Depending on which imalances you present with, Den Mother will custom formulate botanical blends that when absorbed into your body will have targeted therapeutic effects. The use of reflexology and massage in tandem with a ritual foot soak can open these channels even further. Cold Water Therapy Regular cold therapy like use of the cold plunge pool at the Den has shown to help in reducing anxiety and depression by decreasing cortisol levels, lowering the sympathetic stress response, and balancing serotonin levels. Strengthening your body and mind's ability to cope with cold conditions can activate our bodies' natural healing powers and build nervous system resilience to better cope with the stressors of our lives. Our Cold Plunge pool uses powerful cooling, filtration, and sanitation that provides cold, clean water throughout the day making it far superior to an ice bath or chest freezer. Our plunge has a robust filtration system that includes uv, ozone, and a 5 micron filter, assuring crystal clear water that self-cleans after every use. Sauna Sessions Den Mother's traditional steam Tea Sauna experience is inspired by the Nordic tradition. Our sauna provides heat with humidity that is regulated by sprinkling tea on hot stones (\"l\u00f6yly\" in Finish) to create steam. The natural infrared benefits from the heat coming off of the rocks and stones make this experiential style of sauna bathing as enjoyable as it is therapeutic. Infrared rays penetrate deep into the skin providing soft heat that helps drive stored toxins out of the fat cells and into the sweat glands and bloodstream where the body is able to excrete it via sweat \u2014 one of the most effective ways to assist the body in removing toxins. Contrast Therapy Alternating extreme temperatures of hot and cold between our cold plunge pool and sauna reveals a host of benefits: It stirs the lymphatic system, reduces inflammation, increases red blood cell count, increases growth hormone levels, improves endurance and recovery, keeps veins and arteries supple, detoxes metals and toxins, improves sleep, relieves anxiety, reduces stress, and aids in weight loss.
