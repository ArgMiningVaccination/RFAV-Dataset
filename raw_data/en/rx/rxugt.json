However, this kind of energy is often robbed by entities, energetic vampires, and negative people. Learn how to recharge it efficiently. 5 Your Wonderful Body Your body consists of some paths for the energy which flows and feeds all the cells. In the case when one or more of these paths are blocked, you can feel tiredness, weakness, and irritation. The adverse effects of blocked energy paths may cumulate so that your body and mind's health deteriorate. You become more sensitive to pain, the influence of society or any bad strange energies. Your life vigour will also disappear. Your Physical Body Every day your body starts a massive number of processes to keep it alive and fit. You, as well as other people, have the gift of inner self-healing. Your body repairs itself after an illness or injury. When you are sad or cry, your mind and heart are trying to soothe you. Our body is an excellent artwork. However, this incredible machine requires a balanced diet, hydration, care and often protection, not only from external injuries. Exercise, fresh air or sleep helps you maintain physical health and excellent fitness. Your Spiritual Body But you have also got the immaterial part of yourself and it cannot be ignored. This part of yourself also needs feeding and care which helps you to maintain your etheric body in perfect condition. What to write more, you need to take care of your spiritual health because otherwise, whole health is impossible. We often neglect or even ignore, the immaterial, spiritual care, not appreciating the abilities and energy of our body and soul. The spiritual energy controls your intuition and helps with connecting to something bigger than you. It is our internal compass that guides the decisions made throughout our life. This compass will indicate to you when your energy level is insufficient. Be careful and watch them as in this way you will be able to fix the problem instantly. Otherwise, they will become more serious and lead to significant disorders.

Here they are: lack of enthusiasm and joy, even after your goal achievement, the feeling of alienation, the bigger urge to stay alone, sudden cases of tiredness, sickness without a reason, lack of motivation for any activity, a feeling of constant anxiety, and [fear,](https://awakenhappylife.ie/how-to-handle-emotions-in-a-holistic-way/)without the real source. If you, despite sound sleep, a balanced diet and rest, still feel some of the symptoms listed above it means that it is not your body, but your soul that needs rest. 6 Simple Steps to Recharge Your Spiritual Energy When you feel spiritually exhausted, try a simple, but powerful method which does not require any skills or tools. Using such a \"healing procedure\" is an efficient way to recharge your spiritual energy. Step One. Find a Quiet Place and Breathe Deeply Finding a quiet, undisturbed place is the first step. No roommates, family members, or noise are supposed to disturb you. They usually carry a mix of energy, not necessarily positive and can infect you with this cocktail, especially when you yourself are weak. It should also be a place where you like spending time. Next, sit straight on the chair or lie down comfortably on a flat surface. Then, cleanse your mind and cut it from all the daily worries, problems, and chores. Next, close your eyes and take five deep breaths. Be sure that your inhalations are deep, and felt in the abdomen, not only in your chest. Step Two. Praying Position to Boost Your Spiritual Energy While breathing deeply, set your palms for the praying position. Next, gently press your palms to each other, with a stronger pressing of your fingertips. Raise your joined hands up and touch the middle of your forehead or the third eye. Then, leave your connected hands down near your heart chakra area. This trick will stimulate both chakras. Step Three. Rubbing And Heating After having done the deeds described in Step Two, rub one hand into the other so that it will generate some warmth. Next, place your heated right hand on your heart and the left on your navel. In this way, you will charge the heart and sacral chakras. Step Four. [Visualise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(graphics)) While lying with your eyes closed, start visualising the healing white light coming out from your palms, flowing to the exhausted body and soul. Next, visualise the light moving upwards from your toes through your body to the tip of your head. This light is going through each part of your body, each cell and piece of tissue, while healing all the cells, organs and your soul, repairing and strengthening your weak aura, and charging all the chakras. You can even visualise the precious light radiating from your body, creating a protective coat around you. Explore More on Awaken Happy Life Step Five. Remain To Charge Your Spiritual Energy Remain in this position (lying with your eyes closed) until the moment when you feel enough light and energy. The length of the session will depend on how much your body and soul are exhausted. When you are ready, please open your eyes, take your palms from your body and shake them gently forward. Next, get up slowly, shake all your limbs, and stretch so that your circulation will kick out, moving blood to each cell of your body. Step Six. Drink Water After your energising session, drink a big glass of water in order to hydrate your body. You need to be vigilant to dehydration throughout the day after recharging your energy. A short walk is also advisable. In order to achieve satisfactory results, while totally exhausted, repeat the session daily for seven consecutive days. Your palms will instantly charge you with spiritual energy. It is also a quick remedy for healing and rebuilding your body. Remember that healing power is within each being, also you.
