Here at Top Doctors, we'd like to highlight the importance of a good night's sleep during this global health crisis. Sleep, stress and our immune system Good sleep is crucial in maintaining a [ healthy immune system](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/how-sleep-better). A decline in the quality and the quantity of sleep can affect our immunity leaving us more susceptible to illnesses, including viruses. [A 2015 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26118561) study found a direct link between [ shorter sleep times and an increased risk of getting a cold ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/style/self-care/waking-up-at-4-am.html) for healthy adults aged 18 to 55; specifically, those sleeping less than five hours or between five and six hours had a greater chance of catching a virus than those sleeping for seven hours a night. Whilst there are still many studies to be made about coronavirus in general, the science is simple: a good night's sleep supports the release of a protein that helps the immune system respond quickly to antigens, foreign substances which cause the body's immune response to kick in. According to the director of the [ Northumbria Centre for Sleep Research](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/e/jason-ellis/), during sleep, our immune system releases proteins that are called cytokines, more specifically T cells. He highlighted that \"T cells identify and attach themselves to any infected cells in the body and destroy them - and the infection, too\" and help in our response to stress. If our sleep is disrupted, our bodies produce fewer of the cytokines that are important in fighting infections. The stress \"shield\" Lack of sleep also causes a biological stress response, increasing levels of stress hormones such as [ cortisol ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsmc.2014.11.007) in our bodies the next day. Prolonged lack of sleep can make us less resilient when managing daily stressors and can make us more vulnerable to experiencing stress. We should think of sleep as our \"shield\" against stress. A lack of sleep can damage the shield. If we don't get enough sleep, the shield cracks and you are more susceptible to stress. When you get enough, the shield is restored. Credit: Alicia C. Allan, from the Institute for Social Science Research at the University of Queensland Conversely, mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, can affect our sleep. According to one of our [l](http://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/sue-peacock) [eading psychologists](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/sue-peacock), [ Dr Sue Peacock](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/sue-peacock), [ anxiety ](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/anxiety) is also one of the biggest causes of [ insomnia](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/insomnia). Short-term insomnia is usually the [ result of stress ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167) or a traumatic event, so a combined approach to tackle both mental health issues and poor sleep is often the most effective method of treatment. Ultimately, applying methods to promote good mental health and to reduce anxiety will improve the quality of your sleep, and good quality sleep improves resilience to stress and the way we react to it. Being resilient to stressors is crucial during these unprecedented times. Tips for improving sleep during the COVID-19 crisis One of our top psychologists, [Dr Peacock](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/sue-peacock), advises writing thoughts racing in your head in [ \"let go\" ](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-articles/5-tips-for-better-sleep) of things that are causing worry and distress\", helping to improve your sleep. Staying informed about the coronavirus situation is important, but you should also limit the amount of news you look at. A neurologist and former president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, recently recommended to limit reading news on coronavirus to \"only once a day and preferably not near bedtime\" as reading them can cause a spike in anxiety levels. Similarly, one of our top specialists [ Dr Nikki Scheiner](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/nikki-scheiner), highlighted the importance of avoiding 'alarmist sources of information' as they will 'absolutely increase anxiety'. Dr Scheiner also highlighted the importance of mindfulness in her' [ top tips for good mental health ](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-b1un4DMFQ/) during the coronavirus pandemic' video, which can be viewed on the [ Top Doctors UK Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-b1un4DMFQ/) Meditating and mindfulness can help reduce symptoms of stress and anxiety, which will ultimately result in better sleep. Dr Scheiner offers [e-Consultations](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/e-consultation/) for further advice but also recommends the use of apps such as 'Calm' and 'Headspace' to soothe anxiety and to practice mindfulness. [Studies ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sleep-daylight/morning-daylight-exposure-tied-to-a-good-nights-sleep-idUSKCN18E23E) also suggest that getting natural light during the day allows us to feel less depressed, stressed and helps our bodies to stick to a consistent sleep schedule as it helps to 'calibrate the body's internal \"circadian clock\". So, ensure you get as much natural light as possible during confinement, pull back the curtains and lets those rays shine through. Nutrition and sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic During the lockdown, we'll be heading to the fridge perhaps a little more than we usually would. You may want to opt for certain foods such as dairy products, rice and [ oats ](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/how-to-get-good-nights-sleep-food-before-bed-what-to-eat-a7559961.html) that can produce chemicals which [ help increase our desire to sleep. ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/eat_for_good_sleep) Caffeine can interfere with the process of falling asleep and prevent deep sleep due to it being a stimulant (that increases anxiety levels and alertness) so drinking less coffee may help you to sleep better. [Dr Scheiner ](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/nikki-scheiner) recently highlighted that \"when we're isolating at home, there's a temptation to drink more tea or coffee, whilst this may be an absolute pleasure, it also puts more caffeine into our systems and that means if we're anxious to start with, it will elevate our anxiety levels.\" [A recent study ](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/12/the-alarming-truth-about-how-sugar-ruins-your-sleep) suggests that a diet that is high in sugar is bad news when it comes to sleep so you may like to cut down your sugar intake also. If you're regularly unable to fall asleep, it can have a very negative impact on your mood, concentration, energy levels and your interaction with others. You may also find it affects your ability to complete simple daily tasks.
