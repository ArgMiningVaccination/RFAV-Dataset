We are all exposed to viruses and bacteria every day, however, we fall ill sometimes, and some of us more often than others. The reason for this susceptibility is to do with how strong and effective your immune system is. If your immune system is robust, then even if you are in a crowd of sick people, you won't develop symptoms of an infection. On the other hand, if your immune system is struggling, then you will get sick more often and take longer to recover. Essentially, your immune system is your body's 'department of defence'. Your immune system protects you from potentially harmful invaders by recognising and responding to them as a threat. When the immune system is functioning well, it acts like a powerful, well-regulated army. It consists of several highly specialised types of white blood cells, much the same way an army is made up of many different specialty divisions. Factors That Can Contribute To The Weakening Of The Immune System Include: - Physiological, psychological and emotional stress. - Lack of exercise ( or too much exercise if you are overtraining ). - Lack of sleep, rest and relaxation. - Diet low in fresh fruit, vegetables and lean protein sources. - Exposure to pollution, cigarette smoke and/or extremely cold weather. Boosting Your Immune System Naturally The secret to getting sick less often is to build a strong, healthy immune system. Linda can assist you with advice on diet, exercise, natural supplements and lifestyle changes that are specifically designed to boost immune resistance and reduce the incidence of infection. If you already have an infection, there are Natural Medicines that Linda can prescribe to reduce the length of time that you are sick and help to prevent the infection recurring.
