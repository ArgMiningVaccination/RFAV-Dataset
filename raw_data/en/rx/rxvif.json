The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship of in utero and childhood exposure to these purported EDCs and reproductive hormones in adolescent boys who participated in CHAMACOS, an ongoing birth cohort in California's Salinas Valley. We measured o,p'- and p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, PBDEs and PCBs in serum collected from mothers during pregnancy or at delivery and from their sons at 9 years. We measured concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and total testosterone (T) from 234 of their sons at 12 years. In adjusted models, we found that a 10-fold increase in maternal prenatal serum concentrations of BDE-153 was associated with a 22.2% increase 20.9, 206.2) increase in T. Similarly, BDE-100 concentrations were associated with increases in boys' LH levels. A 10-fold increase in total prenatal PCBs was associated with a 64.5% increase (95% CI: 8.6, non- dioxin-like congeners. Boys' hormone levels were only marginally associated with prenatal DDT or DDE in primary models, but when boys' Tanner stage at age 12 was added to models, prenatal maternal DDT levels were associated with decreases in LH (adjusted percent change per 10-fold increase=-18.5%, in the children's serum at 9 years also showed associations between BDE-153 and PCBs. However, there is evidence that these associations appear to be mediated by child BMI. This study suggests associations on male hormones of 12year old boys related to exposure to certain EDC exposure prenatally. The implications on future reproductive function in puberty and adulthood should be determined. "}
