The varieties of non-biomedical practices were used in attempt to ensure a risk-free delivery and the birth of a healthy baby, although the collected data shows that some of them are harmful. To understand why the rural women hold on to these traditions, and possible implications, a qualitative grounded theory approach was used; and a constructed grounded theory termed 'Motherhood during a transitional period' was gener ated. The practical aim was to give health professionals an understanding of the rural women\u00b4s worldview for creating effective culturally sensitive approaches, such as ethno-nurs ing methods, so the rural women\u00b4s cultural needs are taken into consideration and harmful prac tices are avoided. Thirty-seven individual and four focus group interviews, in six rural villa ges and two small towns in rural areas of Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, Southern India, were carr ied out. This study showed that rural women are straddling between two systems of diverge nt meaning in regard to their bodies in general, but also their conceptualizations and expe riences of childbearing and birth. Traditions and cultures are inter-linked and therefore it take s time to modernize a society.

All cultures recognize pregnancy as a special transition period, and many have particular customs and beliefs that dictate activity and behaviour during pregnancy, (Andrews, 2008). Beliefs and customs surrounding the expertise of labour are inf luenced by the fact that it is a biological event and is basically the same in all cultures, bu t the birth experience is also socially constructed. \"ItOtakesOplaceOwithinOaOculturalOcontextOandOisOsh apedObyOtheOperceptionsOandO practicesOofOthatOculture\" , (Liamputtong, 2005b, p. 140).Methods of dealing w ith the pain of labour, recommended position during delivery and th e role of the father and the family vary according to the degree of acculturation to western childbirth customs, religious beliefs and individual preference, (Andrews, 2008). The title o f the paper was inspired by the Tamil women\u00b4s strong wish to give birth to a baby with li ght skin. ' AddOaObitOofOsaffronOtoOmilkOforOaO fairObaby'O and 'TeaOandOcoffeeOwillOmakeOyourObabyOdark' ,Owas the common beliefs, and if the childbearing woman ate saffron during her last mont hs of pregnancy, and avoided black food items the baby should be born with fair skin. A wid e variety of non-biomedical practices were used in Kancheepuram to ensure a risk-free delivery and the birth of a healthy baby of a healthy mother. Later on I will come back to this i n my chapter on findings and analysis. The practical aim of this thesis is to form a basis for health professionals providing an understanding of the rural women\u00b4s existing traditi ons and practices as well as their present worldview. In Tamil Nadu, traditional birth systems are undergoing large-scale changes under the influence of Western medicine. It is fundamenta l for health personnel to understand the traditions and thus design effective culturally sen sitive approaches, such as the ethno-nursing methods, so that the Tamil rural women\u00b4s cultural n eeds are taken into consideration and also that dangerous beliefs are avoided. My interest in this topic can be found in my 20 yea rs experience as a professional midwife in Sweden. I wanted to explore other women's supposed beliefs and traditional practices regarding childbearing in their culture. This thesi s is based upon data collected during eight weeks in autumn 2008, in Kancheepuram Tamil Nadu, S outhern India. 2 Postpartum period is the period beginning immediat ely after the birth of a child and extended about s ix weeks. The woman's body goes through numerous chang es and recover from pregnancy and birth. 2 1.1 AIM OF RESEARCH AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS This thesis focuses on traditional beliefs and prac tices regarding pregnancy, birth and postpartum period in Kancheepuram district, Tamil N adu. First of all, it is important to gain knowledge of various existing traditions and belief s in regard to childbirth that exist and are being used in the society of the Tamil rural women, and thus finding out which cultural traditions that are harmful and could put the woman and her baby at a risk during pregnancy, birth and postpartum. In order to effectively being able to change these harmful beliefs it is important to be knowledgeable as to why the rural women maintain th ese old cultural traditions, this so that awareness could be raised of problems associated wi th the tradition, and work could begin to eliminate the harmful practices. Thus, this study s eeks to investigate and explain why the rural women keep to old cultural traditions in spite of t he modernisation of obstetrics. A grounded theory is constructed termed 'Motherhood during a t ransitional period'. To fulfil the study\u00b4s objective, the following rese arch questions are posed; What kind of explanations are behind these traditio nal beliefs and practice regarding childbearing and postpartum period? What possible implications will these traditional beliefs and practices have for th e rural Tamil women and their babies? 1.2 STRUCTURE OF THESIS The structure of the thesis is as follows; ChapterO2 provides a background to the thesis research problem and will touch upon the Indian soc iety with focus on family and motherhood. Chapter 3 starts with presenting the research design and i s followed by the methodology used to collect the field data. The sam ple and the data collection methods are described next, before some thoughts about 'rigour' . How the data was analysed is the next heading, before the chapter ends up with ethical co nsiderations. Chapter 4 moves on to the empirical findings. The chapter includes the findin gs of the collected data. It commences with findings during pregnancy, followed by labour pract ices, and postpartum before ending up with the findings from a gypsy community. In ChapterO5 the theoretical framework will be outlined. Starting with a presentation of the const ructed grounded theory termed `Motherhood 3 during a transitional period\u00b4, followed by an exist ing theory, of Abrams,(1982), and the chapter closes with a research frontier review. Cha pter 6 includes my conclusions and a discussion regarding why change of worldviews takes time. FinallyOChapterO 7 finally closes the thesis with a discussion on possible recommenda tions, such as culture sensitive care. 2 BACKGROUND In this chapter I will present Indian society focus ing on family and motherhood. It's important to understand how the Indian society is constructed regarding values and norms to get a complete picture why the rural Tamil women still ad here to their traditional practices and beliefs. The chapter will also include basic facts of India, the state of Tamil Nadu and Kancheepuram district, since I conducted my researc h there. 2.1 INDIAN SOCIETY ; FAMILY AND MOTHERHOOD In India no institution is more important than the family, (Purnell, 2005), and motherhood is very much wanted since it is recognized as a social ly powerful role,(Choudhry, 1997). Motherhood may also be due to the fact that being a mother is privileged and valued, often even compulsory in the Indian family context. In ad dition to this to be a childless woman is to actualize the fear of the loss of heredity (Chawla, 2006). In India becoming a mother of a son is a blessing because the sons carries the family n ame and takes care of the parents in their old age. Daughters are cause for worries because of the traditions associated with her parents burden of her dowry, and they move away from their parents at marriage, (Van Hollen, 2003). In this study, Bakul, one twin mother of wife belong to the same class 3 since the husband and wife have been united in the marriage, (Dandekar, 1958). The head of the fam ily is normally a man, based on the principle of the men's superiority over women, (Bas ham, 1967, pr. 1979; Government of Tamil Nadu, 2003; Purnell, 2005). Pregnancy in Indi a is viewed as a normal physiologic phenomenon, and the childbearing mother is supervis ed and guided by the older women in the family and/or the community. To visit a doctor requ ired the event of a problem, (Choudhry, 1997). The shift from home births, attended by fema le relatives and dais 4, to hospitalized births overseen by biomedical professionals influen ced the lives of the people. For many Indian women, childbearing and birth is no longer s een as a natural event, instead it seen as an phenomenon to be managed by using technological int erventions and supervised by health personnel. (Liamputtong, 2005a). While medical care is free for all citizens, persons in rural areas often have little access to it. Purity is an important value in the Hindu culture, and is very much concerned with childbearing and the first time after delivery. Many Hindus consider that the most impure substances are the di scharges of one\u00b4s body, and women are seen as impure because of their menstruation,(Cowar d, 2000). The conception of a child is very impure, since it involves the discharges of bo dy fluids, and makes the mother impure; consequently the baby is also seen impure. I will r eturn to these traditions in my findings chapter further ahead. 2.2 INDIA I have included a section regarding Indian economic status since it is important to understand how poverty and illiteracy affect the rural women's lives, and also maintain cultural traditions and high rates of maternal mortality. India has one of the ten fastest growing economies in the world (NFHS-3, 2006). While economic policies in the 1990s have been able to re move the constraints on economic growth, the policies regarding social development and healt h have not been able to remove impediments to allow any significant development (U NICEF, 2008b). The most important challenge for India today is poverty. Although the incidence of poverty has declined by 3 Castes in India have to do with class structure; a nd accordingly to Hindu religious text, the caste s ystem is a group membership that has a specific rank in societ y. 4 Traditional birth attendant in India. 5 almost 50 percent from 1978 to 2000, (WHO, 2007), s till 34.7 percent of India's population are living on less than 1 US$ /day, (WorldBank, 200 5). Education is one of the most powerful instruments f or reducing poverty and inequality, (UNICEF, 2008a). Every child in India is entitled to primary school education. School is free and compulsory for children ages six to fourteen. T he Indian government has expressed a strong commitment towards education for all; howeve r, India still has one of the lowest female literacy rates in Asia, (WorldBank). This lo w level of literacy not only has a negative impact on women's lives but also on their families' lives. Numerous studies show that illiterate women have high levels of fertility and mortality, poor nutritional status, low earning potential, and little autonomy within the household , (ibid). Accordingly to UNICEFs, (2008a), maternal mortality is reduced by women\u00b4s education and they point out that two maternal deaths will be prevented for each additional year o f education achieved by 1,000 women. They also highlight that girl\u00b4s education about hea lth-care practices increased the utilization of health services during pregnancy and birth and b y this also reduce the maternal mortality, (ibid). 2.3 THE STATE OF TAMIL NADU Since the state of Tamil Nadu differs from many oth er states in India in regard to the wealth and literacy of the population, and also in regard to obstetric care, I have included a section regarding Tamil Nadu. I wanted to give some context in regard to my field research, and therefore I have included a short section about the district of Kancheepuram in the end of this section. Tamil Nadu is located in the South of India, (see f igure 1) and the state's population was approximately 62 million as per census 2001, (Gover nment of Tamil Nadu, 2003). The main city is Chennai and is a historic centre of the tra ditional Tamil medical system known as Shidda 5, and has remained a setting with multiple forms of medical systems, (Van Sickle, 2008).( I will expand the concept of Shidda in chap ter four).

One of the most important challenges for India toda y is poverty. However the diversity both within India and between different social classes i s large. The state of Tamil Nadu is well off with a healthier and more educated population than the country as a whole. The state has made an effort into expanding maternal care, and th e state is often considered one of India\u00b4s model states with respect to the provision and use of antenatal care and births in institutions. In spite of this, in many rural areas in Tamil Nadu , women still adhere to traditional practices that sometimes are harmful. Becoming a mother is ve ry desirable, and the childbearing mother is supervised and guided by the older women in the family and/or the community. The shift from home births attended by female relatives and dais, to hospitalized births overseen by biomedical professionals was influenced the live s of the people. These two discrepancies, introduction of maternal c are and adherence to traditional practices, is why the Tamil women are in a transition period a t the moment, and have one foot in each camp. This discrepancy formed the basis of my thesi s. I will return to this issue and discuss this more specifically later on in the findings and theory chapter. 3 METHODOLOGY In this section, the study\u00b4s methodological approac h is presented; the methodologies used to collect the field data are accounted, the sample is described and the problems that occurred in the field data collection are reviewed. 3.1 RESEARCH DESIGN This thesis is based upon primary material collecte d during field work that was carried out during eight weeks in August and September 2008. In this thesis I have used the grounded theory as an overall approach, and I emphasize with Charmaz,(2006), constructivist grounded theory approach, since she advocates that grounded theory must move on from its positivist origins. A constructivist grounded theory approach emphasizes the studied phenomenon of study, and sees both data and analysis as created f rom shared experiences and relationships with participants and other sources of data. Her ap proach differs from the classic grounded 8 theory, in the sense of how the theory will be disc overed. Glaser and Strauss, (1967) have a discussion about discovering theory as emerging fro m data separate from the scientific observer. Unlike their position Charmaz, (2006) arg ues that neither data nor theories are discovered, she claims that researchers can't claim scientific neutrality, since qualitative research of all sort relies on those who conduct it \"WeOareOnotOpassiveOreceptaclesOintoOwhichO dataOisOpoured\"O (p. 15). She advocates that we construct our grounded theori es; nevertheless researchers are required to be reflexive about what they see, and how they s ee it. Finally the Charmaz approach offers an interpretive portrayal of the world studied and not an exact picture of it. This is a statement that is in line with my own belief of research. Grounded theory researchers can use either quantita tive or qualitative data, but it is almost exclusively adopted in qualitative research, (Schre iber, 2001). I found that a qualitative methodology suited my interest very well, since my research seeks answers to questions that stress how social experience is created and givs me aning, (Denzin, 2008). By using qualitative methods, I hoped to be able to go benea th the surface and analyse the women's subjective experience of childbearing, and obtain a deeper understanding of the existing beliefs and practices regarding pregnancy and child birth in Kancheepuram district, Tamil Nadu, India. I also wanted to explore, what kind of possible implications these traditional beliefs and practice had for the rural Tamil women. In grounded theory, data collection and analysis, a nd eventual theory stand in close relationship to one another, (Strauss, 1998). Glase r and Strauss, (1967) call attention to the significance that the researcher starts the study w ith as few preconceived ideas as possible, and that the research question/s should be broad an d flexible enough to search into a phenomenon in depth. Also Charmaz (2006, p. 17), po ints out; \"weOneedOtoOremainOasOopenOasO possibleOtoOwhateverOweOseeOandOsenseOinOtheOearlyO stagesOofOtheOresearch\" . This approach suited me well and with that knowledge I entered th e field. 9 3.2 ENTERING AND GAINING ACCESS TO THE FIELD During internship 8 at my organisation 9 I had the opportunity to follow a medical team aro und in the different parts of Kancheepuram district. My intention during these visits was just to introduce myself, become familiar with the people a nd the villages and come back later on for my interviews. When it was time to start collecting the data I got help from the organisation where I did my internship. A member of the staff wh o was willing to serve as a gatekeeper 10 and he also helped me initially to select the first villages. To gain access to the hospital and to patients, a medical officer helped me with necessar y approvals. 3.3 THE SAMPLE The study was conducted in rural areas of Kancheepu ram District, Tamil Nadu, South India, and the majority of the participants were located i n outlying rural agricultural areas of Kancheepuram district, which included six villages and two small towns. A small number of participants were located in Chennai, the capital o f the state of Tamil Nadu, and were interviewed at the postnatal care unit at Meenaski Medical Hospital in Kancheepuram, (see appendix 9.5 for information regarding the differen t villages). Most of the interviews took place, in the respondents' home; but for the conven ience of the participants sometimes the interviews were carried out in a room provided by a school or other organization. Five interviews were carried out at Meenaski Medical Hos pital in Kancheepuram. The participants represented in the beginning of th is study were found by chance after I together with the interpreter had walked around in the villages and asked for volunteers. Later on when I had gained more insight and realized that I needed to fill in gaps in my data, I selected my research sites and informants bearing t his in mind. Criteria such as the different castes were then taken into consideration. Since I wanted to explore traditional beliefs and 8 Lund University Master of International Developme nt and Management, (LUMID), is a two-year programme with one semester based in the field. The students are attached to an organisation and it\u00b4s is require d that the students carry out their field work and data collec tion during this time, as the foundation for the fi nal master thesis. The organisation in this case was Hand in Hand India , a local NGO with head office in Kancheepuram. 9 Hand in Hand, Kancheepuram. 10 Someone who can provide access to the field and p articipants or whoever else is needed for a study 10 practices regarding childbearing and birth, then it was mostly Tamil women who were interviewed and I used the selection criteria below to find my respondents; Women Aged 15-49 year Women who had given birth in the past 5 years Had given birth to at least one child Residing in the study area Despite my selection criteria I have five interview s with women who were pregnant for the first time, since sometimes during field research y ou have to go off the cuff. My interpreter helped me to find my respondents, since I did not s peak Tamil, and in these cases he forgot the selection criteria. I decided however to conclu de the interviews. To gain a deeper understanding of the topic, I also included men, in focus group interviews. Also three field nurses and one traditional birth a ttendant, dai, were interviewed. A total of thirty-seven (37) individual interviews, and four focus group interviews were carried out. This gave a total of fifty-six (56) re spondents, since the group interviews had totally nineteen (19) respondents. (See appendix 9. 3 for details). In this study, the sample was restricted to forty-one (41) interviews, since satu ration was reached at the 41 st interview. How I determined saturation will be discussed further i n this chapter, (see section 3.6 Data Analysis). 3.4 DATA COLLECTION METHODS According to Charmaz (2006, p. 15), \" methodsOareOmerelyOtools \", but some are more useful than others. And they have consequences for your re search. My research problem shaped the method I used therefore four data collection method s were combined namely; Semi-structured individual interviews Focus groups interviews Informal and unstructured interviews Literature review 11 The primary source for collection of data in this s tudy was interviews. According to Charmaz, (2006), interviewing is a useful data-gathering met hod using various types of qualitative research. She states that it is a functional method for the interpretive inquiry, since interviewing permits an in-depth exploration of a p articular topic or practice, (ibid). I recorded almost all the interviews 11 , for the purpose of documentation, detailed transc ription and analysis. The tape-recorder was never used with out a participant\u00b4s explicit permission. Probing was done according to each respondent\u00b4s ans wer, which is why the interviews did not follow an exact route of questioning. Each intervie w lasted between 20-50 minutes, entirely dependent on the participants' children's willingne ss to participate. Since it sometimes was a very noisy environment, such as babies crying or ne eded to be breast fed, I sometimes forgot to ask the participants my socioeconomic questions such as age or education. This explains why I do not have full background facts of all my r espondents, or why the interviews sometimes were short in time. Another issue was the Indian caste system 12 . For the rural people this was a very sensitive matter, and I was advised from my organisation not to ask directly regarding their caste. Instead I should as k where they resided, since the most forward caste resides closest to the temple and the schedul e caste and tribes live more remotely. It ended up with a drawing where the respondents showe d where they lived, see appendix 9.3 for further details. I also got help from a staff m ember to find out where the respondents lived and their caste, in spite of this, I ended up with ten unknown. The transcriptions of the audio taped interviews we re carried out by me. Complementary to this, handwritten notes were taken during the inter view, and after each session I also wrote down the main aspects of the interview, such as obs ervations of behaviour etc. Because language is a principal instrument in research, (Ha hn, 2008), the ideal would be that I could have spoken and used the local language Tamil, in m y research. Since that was not the case, an interpreter was used for the interviews. I had t he privilege to employ the same interpreter for almost all interviews, apart from the two first . The interpreter was familiar with the local context and also trusted by the communities. Howeve r, in the end the translator made his own 11 Sometimes the situation did not make it possible t o use the voice-recorder, such as noisy environment . 12 Castes have to do with class structure and castes divide the Indian society of those in the lowest an d outside positions, calling the untouchables/polluted, to th e superior and most `pure\u00b4 part of Indian people, f orward castes. 12 judgements about how and what he translated, and so metimes I got a feeling that he perhaps found difficult to betray his own 'people' in the p resence of a foreigner. 3.4.1 SEMI -STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS According to Hahn, (2008), structured interviews ar e particularly useful for determining patterns of knowledge and belief, because the same questions are asked of multiple participants. In this study a semi-structured interview guide was used, containing a list of questions I wanted to be addressed. Kvale,(2008), points out th at no standard procedures or rules exist for conducting a research interview, but he recommended planning and thematizing the interview study, in order to attain a better quality of colle cted data. According to this advice I developed an interview guide, which contained different theme s regarding my subject, (see appendix 9.5). The interview schedule contained open-ended q uestions. According to Kvale, (2008) and Charmaz, (2006), the use of this kind of open-ended , non-judgemental questions encourages spontaneous statements and stories to emerge. Since I was undertaking sensitive research, I began each interview with \"small talk\" on matters t hat were not necessarily relevant for the interview i.e. icebreakers to make the respondents more relaxed, since according to Kvale, (2008), the first minutes of an interview are cruci al to gain their confidence, so they can talk about their experience and feelings unreservedly. I also reflected upon how many respondents I would need for my research, since I did not have unlimited time and resources. But since I had decided to have a grounded theory approach I ha d to accept that this matter should solve itself by saturation 13 , and I had to \"go with the flow\". 3.4.2 FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS Focus group interviews are ideal for exploring peop le\u00b4s opinion, and experiences related to a topic, and for generating discussion about issues o f important concern to the community, (Hahn, 2008). In this study four focus group interv iews were carried out. Two groups consisted of only men, one group consisted of three elderly women, and one individual 13 Saturation occurs in qualitative research when an researcher believes that s/he cannot longer learn n ew things by studying additional instances of a partic ular empirical category (Ragin, 1994) 13 interview ended up into a group interview in a gyps y community, even though the whole village attended the interview there were four acti ve respondents. Later on I will come back to the gypsy community in the finding and analysing ch apter. The number of participants in the groups' differed. In question of the ideal number o f focus groups participants, some argue that it is between 8 and 12, but researchers who perform sociological studies usually prefer to work with smaller groups of five to six, or even as few as three participants, (Pettersson Odberg, 2004). I regarded focus groups as an appropriate method to explore men\u00b4s views on traditional practices and beliefs regarding childbearing. The t opic dealt with women\u00b4s reproductive bodies, and in the case of sensitive taboo topics, focus group interviews may open a perception that is usually not accessible (Kvale, 2 008). The men were chosen by visiting the villages early in the mornings before the males wen t to work. In this manner the group members were men who happened to be around at the t ime of the interview. It was a mere chance that there were different ages, occupations and marital status in the group members. I also realized that I wanted to gain knowledge fro m the elderly generation of Tamil women; therefore I also selected one group with elderly wo men, since this was a rapid way to deepen my knowledge about the topic. In the gypsy community, the group interview came up spontaneously. My intention was to carry out an individual interview, but the intervie w ended up as a group interview, consisting of four active respondents, (one woman, and three m en). Almost all of the members of the village were around us at the time of the interview . This involvement of the extended family, friends, and even neighbours is described by Choudh ry (1997) and Coward (2000), as a part of the Indian social order, since this provides emo tional and social support. 3.4.3 INFORMAL AND UNSTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS According to Hahn, (2008), informal interviews are hardly interviews at all, since the researcher participates in a normal conversation an d records comments of interest on the research topic. My first informal interview started spontaneously during a conversation early in my study. The second one occurred further on, an d as a part of my theoretical sampling. According to Corbin (2008, p. 143) theoretical I did not use any interv iew guide; handwritten notes were taken during the conversation, since both occasions came up spontaneously. I did not have my voice-recorder nor my interview guide around, but I could not let this restrain this opportunity to gain data. 3.4.4 LITERATURE REVIEWS Accordingly to Charmaz,(2006), the reading of relat ed literature should be postponed until a later stage of research. The purpose of delaying th e literature review is to avoid preconceived ideas that could possibly influence the work, i.e. create an independent analysis, (ibid). I was aware of these instructions regarding the literatur e review in grounded theory. However since this thesis is a student research project, the teac hers required that I should submit both a literature review and a theoretical framework and t his lead me to the library months before I conducted my study. I solved this by gaining a very brief overview of the subject in an attempt to identify gaps in my knowledge. During th e research when I entered new areas of knowledge I did the same kind of search to fill in gaps by theoretical sampling as I mentioned earlier. I constructed an independent theory named, 'Motherhood during a transitional period', and then I searched for existing theories for a com parison. This is in according to grounded theory. I have also made a literature review for co mparison with my findings from the field. 3.5 REACHING FOR QUALITY In most qualitative research the researcher herself is the main tool for data collection, and Bryman (2004), states that in qualitative research the researcher herself is the key instrument for data gathering. What is observed and heard and also what the researcher decides to concentrate upon is very much a product of her pred ilections, (ibid). Also Charmaz, (2006), supports this opinion, as I earlier discussed in th e methodology chapter. I am aware of this 15 matter, also that my profession and work experience will affect my research and my interpretation of my data. Qualitative researchers have to be aware that research is ideologically driven; there is no value-free or bia s-free design, (ibid). However I have to strive for quality and that analysis of my data is of a high quality and trustworthy. I am more interested in authenticity than a single version of truth. With authenticity I mean to get the women's sincere perception of their worldview. Liam puttong, (2005c), uses the term 'rigour' when she refers to the issues that are raised by th e terms validity and reliability, since she thinks these terms, (validity and reliability), der ive from quantitative research methodologies, and are used to assess statistical and experimental studies, and are hard to apply to qualitative research. However qualitative researcher cannot aba ndon this issue, but they need to be conceptualised differently such as rigorously. To e nsure rigour in my research I have striven to use an appropriate method to my research problem , and tried my best to clearly document my methodological and analytic decisions. Ethnical aspects are also taken into consideration as reflexivity. Reflexive research acknowledges acc ording to Liamputtong,(2005c, p. 43), \"/.../OthatOtheOresearcherOisOpartOandOparcelOofOth eOsetting,Ocontext,OandOcultureOtheyOareOtryingO toOunderstandOandOanalyse\"O that is to say, the researcher is the instrument of the research, and by this I am back where I started this discussion. 3.6 DATA ANALYSIS The classic grounded theory texts of Glaser and Str auss (1967) and Glaser (1978) provide an explicit method for analyzing processes. The main s teps in classical grounded theory consist of open, axial, selective coding and to finding a c ore category. The approach is iterative, meaning that data collection and analysis proceed p arallel, repeatedly referring back to each other i.e. constant comparison. Charmaz, (2006), do es not use exactly the same steps as Glaser and Strauss, instead she carries out her cod ing in three phases initial, focused and theoretical coding. This study is a snapshot of the current situation i n Kancheepuram during eight weeks in August and September 2008, and will only reflect th e current situation in the selected villages and towns, and will not generate any general knowle dge about the topic. 16 3.6.1 INITIAL CODING In this study I went through the collected data at the end of each interview day, and compared my data with data, and a short summary with methodo logical notes. I started with no concepts, and initial coding is the first step of t heoretical analysis that pertains to the early finding of categories and their properties. Initial coding can be compared to brainstorming for opening up the data to all potentials and possibili ties within them. I stopped and asked analytical questions regarding the data I have gath ered, and by this I tried to see actions in the segments of data. For example the questions were su ch; \"what is the data about?\", and \"what can I see in the data?\" I went through it fast, sin ce speed and spontaneity is required during initial coding, and created codes that best fit the data. This is an advantage with grounded theory since initial coding is provisional and you can always come back and change if necessary. All my codes arise out of the collected data. I began to study the data word for word and line-by -line 14 , since the data consisted of very detailed information and this gave me a close look at what the participants said, and struggled with. In the beginning the codes were very short su ch as; normal delivery, blessing, food, mother\u00b4s house, breast milk, donkey milk etc. For e xample when I asked a woman if the pregnancy had changed her daily routines somehow sh e answered; \"MyOparentsOtoldOmeOnotOtoO sleepOtheOwholeOtime,OdoOnotOeatOpapaya,OandOdoOnot OliftOheavyOweights\". From this answer my original codes were tiredness, food restriction and miscarriage. I then coded with gerunds 15 since Glaser (1978) advocates coding with gerunds. Gerunds help the researcher to detect processes and gain a strong sense of action, (Charm az, 2006). By using inOvivoOcodes I tried to check up if I had grasped the importance of the da ta, if my interpretation and the participant's meanings and actions have been preserved, since, in -vivo codes is concepts that use the actual words of research participants rather than being na med by myself. For example; 'red flower', 'mother\u00b4s house', and 'sweet words', were commonly used by the respondents in my data. I then moved on and tried to find as many codes as po ssible; and to compare the codes with new ones. These initial codes helped me to separate data into categories and to see processes according to Charmaz, (ibid). I asked myself questi ons about the data continuously. Such questions included; 'what processes are at issue he re?' and 'how can I define it?' or 'what are 14 Line-by-line coding means naming each line of your written data, (B. G. Glaser, 1978). 15 The nouns turn the actions into topics, by using g erunds. With gerunds you gain a strong sense of act ion and sequence in your coding. 17 the consequences of the process?' From the beginnin g of the coding of data, I wrote memos 16 . This memo-writing continued throughout the whole co ding and helped me to clarify and identify which codes to treat as analytical categor ies early in the research process. 3.6.2 FOCUSED AND THEORETICAL CODING Focused coding means \"usingOtheOmostOsignificantOand/orOfrequentOearlier OcodesOtoOsiftO throughOlargeOamountsOofOdata\"O (Charmaz, 2006, p. 57), and requires decisions abou t which initial codes make the most analytical sense to cat egorize your data. Focused coding helps the researcher to check the preconceptions about the to pic, (ibid). After this I continued to select and create larger segments of data. The most signif icant and/or frequent earlier codes such as hot and cold beliefs, wish for a light skinned baby , social cultural traditions, safe delivery, evil spirits, mother in law were put into broader catego ries. For example the codes food restrictions and food taboos, were now lifted highe r levels such as woman\u00b4s diet. By this time I had a large amount of categories that needed to b e compared for discovering possible relationships and patterns between them. My memos h elped me during my \"zigzag\" route through the data. If I realized that some category was weak or incomplete i.e. I had some gap, I sought more data by theoretical sampling, since t he main purpose of theoretical sampling is to direct you where to go, and seek events or cases that clarify your categories, (ibid). Through the use of theoretical sampling I moved for ward. When new data did not give me more insights, nor gave me more categories, I decid ed that I had reached saturation. Then I continued to study my categories and memos and I as ked myself questions such as; \"are the definitions of major categories complete?\", and \"ha ve I established strong theoretical links between categories and their properties in addition to the data?\" I started to see which ones to treat as the major concept and in the end identifie d and selected the core category. This means that the categories were organized around a central explanatory concept that explained what my research was about; safeguardOtheOlifeOandOwellMbeingOofOtheObabyOdurin gOpregnancy,ObirthO andOpostpartum , since this concept could be related to all the ot her categories in the analysis. 16 Preliminary analytic notes about the codes compari sons and other ideas about the data that occur to t he researcher. 18 3.7 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethical questions require special attention in the study of a culture in which the researcher is an outsider(Sobo, 2009). During the data collection I had permission from the administrations of Meenaski Medical Hospital, and also approvals fr om the Panchayat17 , and village leaders. However, data cannot generally be collected from or about human beings whiteout their consent, (ibid). When finding the participants, I k ept in mind that the villagers had the right to decide whether they wanted to participate and share their personal privacy for research purpose. Since it was not practical or feasible to use a written agreement, the researcher used a verbal personal approval of all the respondents i n the study, and of all research participants taking part on a voluntary basis. The interview was introduced by a briefing, in which I briefly told the respondents the purpose and goals of my research, further information or questions waited until the interview was over. I wa s very careful not to create any false expectations that I was not able to fulfil in the f uture, but perhaps I did not pay enough attention to discussing the returns of attending th e research. Sometimes I felt that I was left in the dark in regard to what was actually presented t o the respondents, if they understood the purpose of the research, since I did not speak Tami l. I have earlier mentioned this matter concerning interpretation, when I discussed data co llecting methods (section 3.4). The respondents were also informed that they had the ri ght to withdraw at any stage of the interview without any consequences In this study, w here the respondent's statements from a private interview situation may appear in a public report, safety measures such as coding of the respondent\u00b4s name and place were needed to be t aken to protect the participants\u00b4 privacy. All respondents will remain anonymous; since the pa rticipants chose that their identities not would be revealed. Therefore in all quotations I ha ve used pseudonyms. 4 FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS In this chapter I will present and discuss the find ings of the empirical data collected during my field research. This will be presented in four m ain sections: pregnancy, delivery, postpartum practices, and finally the findings from a gypsy community. 17 A Panchayat is a cluster of 2-3 villages. 19 Traditions can be both beneficial and harmful or ne utral. Harmful traditions must be those that affect the mother and or child negatively and benef icial affect them positively. I will carry this concept forward when I present and discuss my findi ngs in this chapter. The category 'traditions' emerged from the data, and was one of the categories linked to the core category. (See chapter 3, methodology for further details, an d appendix 9.2 Table 2 for an overview). WHO, (2001, p. antenatal care 18 has been an essential part in the extension of pri mary health care. In this study 100% of the women, who have bee n pregnant in the last five years, stated that they had monthly received some basic antenatal care. This is consistent with India's latest National Family Health Survey, (NFHS-3, 2006), whic h shows that 99% of the women who gave birth in the last three years received antenat al care. However the knowledge regarding why they attended antenatal care was often vague. V ery few women mentioned the relation between antenatal care and to ensure a safe deliver y. Most answers related to the growth of the baby i.e. they did not see the benefits for the mselves. 4.1.1 BEHAVIOURAL PRECAUTIONS During the whole childbearing period the elderly wo man in the family such as mother-in-law, or other elderly woman in the community provided gu idance and assistance to the expectant mothers, since childbearing was seen as a very vuln erable condition. The pregnant women\u00b4s activities were restricted in many ways. The pregna nt woman is considered responsible for 18 The aim of antenatal care is to monitor the progre ss of pregnancy in order to support maternal health and normal development of the unborn child. Antenatal c are in Kancheepuram is primarily provided through v illage health nurse, or by a multipurpose health worker. 20 her baby\u00b4s protection, i.e. her behaviour influence s her pregnancy, and thereby the outcome of the birth. To avoid miscarriage or stillbirth 19 , childbearing women are warned to avoid rigorous activities such as hard work, and also avo id lifting heavy weights such as rice bags, and water buckets. Most women were aware of this an d tried to adjust their work, but for some poor women this was impossible advice to follo w. Aishani a rural poor woman told; \"IO haveOheardOtheOadvice,O\u00b4doOnotOdoOtheOhardOwork\u00b4,Ob utOIOhaveOtoOgoOoutOandOwork,ObecauseOofO theOmoney,OIOhaveOtoOdoOit....\" . Otherwise normal household work and walking were encouraged activities since it was believed to prep are for an easy delivery. A couple of women mentioned that they shared the hard household work with the mother in law during pregnancy to protect the baby. Travelling by bus during childbearing was another r estricted activity. Many pregnant women state that they avoid travel by bus up to the fifth month of pregnancy 20 , and some pregnant women also mentioned that they avoided busses durin g the whole pregnancy. The reason behind this was 'jam-packed' buses and they feared that this could harm the baby, and even cause miscarriage. Sleeping on the left side was no t recommended either to pregnant women since the common belief was that this would harm th e child. Some women also asserted that this would lead to the baby getting in to the wrong position, (breech presentation), and cause a difficult delivery and even caesarean. Water in different ways was avoided by pregnant wom en. They feared coldness and to bring sickness not only to themselves but also to their u nborn babies. Washing clothes and other household work connected with water were therefore avoided. One nurse explained for me; \"/...andOIOdoOnotOwantOtoOwashOanyOclothes,OnoOneed OforOwashing...O/OSglyphYz5otOatOanyOtimesOIOwillOputO myOhandsOinOtheOwater,OIOwillOgetOsick\"OOOOOOO The reason behind this was the hot and cold theory 21 , and I will come back and describe this theory, in more detail in the section regarding `di etary precautions\u00b4 in this chapter. One 19 Stillbirth; a child which has issued forth from it s mother after twenty-fourth week of pregnancy, and which did not at any time after being completely expelled breathe or show any other signs of life. 20 Tamil women are often said to be pregnant for ten months, in Europe and western countries, women are said to be pregnant for ninth calendar month. This distinction is due to different solar calendar. In Tamil Nadu some still use the ancient Tamil calendar based on lunar cycles, and some rural women have only knowle dge of this calendar(Van Hollen, 2003). 21 In India the theory of \"hot and cold\" play a centr al role, it\u00b4s a construction of the body as fluctua ting between states of \"hot and cold\" and health as a balance be tween these two states. 21 woman also feared miscarriage and mentioned that sh e couldn't visit her mother since she needed to cross a waterway and there was no bridge. Another strong cultural conviction was that expecta nt mothers should not get together; especially during the last months of pregnancy 22 . It was associated with extreme bad luck, sickness and even the death of both babies. For sam e reason expectant mothers were particularly advised not to meet women with previou s miscarriages, nor the husband\u00b4s sister. The avoidance to the husband\u00b4s sister was complicat ed and was somehow linked to the family relations. The problem arose when they lived in dif ferent villages, if they lived together in a joint family there were no problems. Deepa, from a rural village tried to explain for me; O \"BothOsidesOdoOnotOwantOtoOseeOeachOother ; theOrelationshipOwillObeOthere,OsoOtheyOdon\u00b4tOwantO toO meetOeachOother\" . Several women also mentioned that a childbearing woman should avoid newborn babies since it was believed to cause exces sive crying of the newborn. The rural women also told me that they were recomme nded to stay calm and avoid strong emotions such as anger and fear during pregnancy. I ndignation was believed to result in sickness or death for the unborn baby, and also for the mother. For the same reason some pregnant women have been recommended not to attend any funerals nor be around any sort of death since sighting a dead body and smoke of a fun eral pyre, could cause breathing problems for the child. As Vahini a rural women to me; \" IfOsomeOpeopleOhaveOdied,OIOdoOnotOwantOtoOgoO toOtheOhouse,Oit\u00b4sOnotOgoodOforOtheObaby,ObecauseOt heyOgetOaOshock,OnotOgoodOforOthem,OtheyOwillO beOsick \" As a midwife who has her whole working experience f rom Swedish obstetrics, I was surprised that several of the respondents had experienced the death of one or more children. The women often mentioned it through an oversight, and it see med to be something that they thought to be natural and they accepted it. To deal with this rea lity the Tamil people have created different kinds of beliefs and practices, and this study show s that in most cases with premature dead babies, the participants blamed evil for having att acked and killed their unborn babies. 22 Some women mention that it was dependent upon the sex of the unborn babies. Same sex was harmless, bu t if the babies have different sex it would bring sic kness and death. And because they did not know the sex, they avoid each other. 22 4.1.2 EVIL SPIRITS In India a pregnant woman is attractive to evil spi rits, (Jeffery, 1989), since pregnant women are believed to send out a special smell which attr acts evil spirits. This study established that evil spirits are seen as particularly obstinate and lethal. Almost all respondents told me about the strong belief in evil spirits and the evil eye. Very few women stated that they did believe in the evil spirits, but during my probing question s most of them acknowledged that they took measures for protection against evil spirits, and o nly a few maintained that they did not believe in evil spirits at all. Especially dangerou s periods of time for pregnant women were dusk and dawn, because of the amount of evil spirit s, who could occupy them and cause harm. Also going outside after darkness, was thought to b e very dangerous and not recommended. If it was unavoidable to leave the house, the women ex pressed great fear, and protection against evil spirits was important. Most common was to put herbal leaves in their hands, wear leather shoes, and more rarely they had also brought a stic k. Kalavati, who was a 24 year old rural woman, and had the experience that her first child died intra-uterine when she was seven months hour the women also avoid any kind of household work. Cutting vegetables, was believed to harm the child, resulting in a hand icapped child, and thereby caused a difficult delivery. The same caution was also valid during midday, at 12.30. Almost all interviewed women stated that they stayed inside th eir houses during this time, since the evil was around, and the women preferred to take a rest after lunch. Not even relaxing activities such as stitching clothes, or binding flowers were recommended. The poorest rural women said that they were forced to continue their work b urden even during midday, and they expressed great fear and worry for that reason. Some rural women who have had a previous premature dead baby also said that they did not take any unnecessary risk in the next pregnancy. Th ey preferred to stay inside their houses 23 during almost the whole pregnancy, so they avoided attacks from evil. The only exceptions to this were if they needed to go to the hospital for antenatal check-ups, or for a quick bath. 4.1.3 DIETARY PRECAUTIONS ; TRADITIONAL MEDICINE AND HOT AND COLD THEORY Medical beliefs in India are a blend of modern and traditional theories and practices, and include multiple forms of biomedicine, traditional systems of medicine, homeopathy, and a wide variety of medical knowledge tied to religious practices and astrology, (Van Hollen, 2003). The traditional systems of medicine in India are based on the Tridosa theory 23 , and Indian healers, use Ayurvedic 24 , Shidda, and Unani medical systems. In Southern In dia and in Tamil Nadu most local health traditions spring from Sidda, which is an indigenous system of medicine, and is largely based on an understanding of food as medicine. (Purnell, 2005; Van Hollen, 2003). The theory of \"hot and cold\" play a central role and it\u00b4s a construction of the body as fluctuating between states of \"hot and cold \", and health as a balance between these two states. For example too much heat in the body i s believed to cause hot diseases 25 . Generally women are considered to be hotter than me n, and pregnancy is considered to be a very hot state, since, during pregnancy the woman\u00b4s heat in her body will increase substantially. This study points out that the hot and cold theory is still very important in Kancheepuram. Avoidance of hot food was particularly important fo r Tamil women in early pregnancy, since heat was believed to stimulate uterine contractions and result in a miscarriage. Papaya 26 was one of the most widespread and feared food items du ring childbearing, and was considered taboo. In chapter five under research frontier, I w ill go into more details regarding papaya and present what Adebiyi, (2002), and Ferro-Luzzi, (198 0), have found regarding this. 23 The body is made up of modifications of the five e lements; air, space, fire, water and earth. These modifications are formed from food and must be main tained within proper proportions for health. 24 Ayurveda; traditional, Hindu system of medical dia gnosis and practice, based on ancient Hindu texts. 25 The symptoms are external visible and include redn ess of the skin, rashes, boils, swelling and other skin maladies. Also liquid flowing out of the body such as vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding and abortion are s een as hot diseases, (Pool, 1987). 26 Papaya is supposed to cause diarrhoea with pain in lower abdomen, and hence cause abortion of the foe tus. 24 Mango, pineapple pumpkin, sesame, black seed, curry , and spices in general, were other items to be avoided for the same reason. Many women also restricted non-vegetarian food such as pork; mutton and chicken since these foods were als o seen as very hot. Banhi, a young rural women told me; \"DuringOchildbearingOIOdoOnotOeatOpapayaOandOpineap pleOduringOtheOwholeO pregnancyOpapaya,OsinceOtheyOareOrestricted.OBlackO grapesOareOalsoOrestricted\". Restrictions on water intake were also mentioned by some rural women, leading back to the fear of the growth of the baby into a large baby, a nd thereby cause a difficult delivery. Water intake was also believed to lead to swollen legs, a s explained by nurse Kamalkali; \" /... thisOisO aOproblem.OTheOvillageOpeopleObelieveOthatOtheyOdoO notOneedOtoOdrinkOmoreOwaterOduringO pregnancy,OtheyObelieveOifOtheyOdrinkOwater,OtheOle gOwillObeOswollen...soOtheyOavoidOwater\"O Restrictions regarding coffee and tea were mentione d by a few women. The reasons behind this differed. Fear for a hairless child, miscarria ge and darkOskinOofOtheObaby were the most the women in this study had a strong desire that the baby will be born light skinned 27 . That's how I chose my title for this thesis as I mentioned earlier in my introduction chapter. Most of the rural childbearin g women ate saffron 28 and avoided all sorts of black food items, such as black grapes, seeds, f ruits, dates, in their anxiety not to pass on the blackness to the baby. Even oral iron supplemen tation 29 was avoided. The intake of saffron started from the sixth month of pregnancy a nd onwards until delivery. Salvi one of the pregnant rural women mentioned that she had tried s affron but was advised to end it by her doctor; 27 According to Das Gupta, (2007), the ideology of \"f airer is better\" was promoted by colonialism, but it goes back even further to the caste system, which existe d 2000 years before India was colonized. The system equates light skin with a more revered caste. Membe rs of the highest caste are supposed to be lighter then the poorer labourers, they are comparatively darker. 28 Commonly mentioned as the 'red` flower'. 29 Iron tablets are black coloured, and iron tablets causes black stool of medicine was very common during late pregnancy. The elderly women in the household such as the mother in law usually pre pared it for the mother to be. Kashayam 30 O mixed together with coffee was believed to cause an d strengthen labour pains. Strong labour pains, were desirable for a quick and easy (normal) delivery. Other traditional home remedies mentioned as mellgu,Ocira,Orassam were also used for the same reason. A few women al so believed that garlic and bananas would give an easy birth. 4.1.4 `S EEMANTHAM \u00b4 AND LEAVING HUSBAND \u00b4S HOUSE In Tamil Nadu the people celebrated a traditional p regnancy ritual called ` Seemantham\u00b4 . It was a ritual for honouring and celebrating a woman' s first pregnancy, since in Tamil Nadu; the sanctity of motherhood is a concept. Every woma n in Kancheepuram, irrespective of caste or religion, celebrated `Seemantham\u00b431 , and the ceremony was held in the ninth month of pregnancy. Sometimes it was a whole series of cerem onies if the women\u00b4s family was very caring about her 32 . The reason given to celebrate was to satisfy the pregnant woman\u00b4s desire, 'aka\u00ed', and bless her so that she would feel happy mentall y, since this would take away unnecessary fears about the pains of delivery and m ake the women relaxed, and by this; ensure a normal delivery and thereby a healthy chil d. The day after the woman has celebrated \u00b4 Seemantham\u00b4, the woman leaves her husband\u00b4s house in order to stay at her parent's 33 house, often in another village. The women general ly stayed at their parent\u00b4s house between one to two m onths prior to delivery, and most commonly three to six months afterwards. It was sai d to be an old socio cultural tradition, and 30 Kashayam is a herbal decoction usually of cumin. 31 With the exception of the couple that have \"marria ge by love\", e.g. not arranged marriage. 32 Seemantham were then celebrated in the 5 th , 7 th , and 9 th month of pregnancy. Different relatives then share and arrange it for the pregnant mother. 33 Named `mother\u00b4s house\u00b4 by the participants 26 the official function behind was that the pregnant woman could relax and rest from household work, and as well be nourished by the parents 34 i.e. prepare for the birth of a healthy baby. The male respondent also pointed out that it became less tense between the couple, and all men interviewed in this study were said to be pleas ed how it was organized, and they visited their wives regularly. In my theory chapter I will develop and discuss the different functions more detailed. Summary Pregnancy is a critical period with increased vulne rability for women, but it\u00b4s also a process of maturity and increased possibilities for women. The elderly women in her family and society guide her about what kind of demands the ne w role will put on her, and what kind of danger there are during this period of time, and ho w to protect against these threats. The stated purposes behind the advice were to avoid abo rtion, stillbirth and a difficult delivery. The pregnant woman\u00b4s state of mind made her also ve ry subjected to supernatural forces. Today almost all rural Tamil women also attend ante natal check-ups monthly at the village health nurse or by hospital, in spite of this; the pregnant women are restricted in their activities and diet by the traditional practices an d beliefs. Beneficial traditions, for both the pregnant mother and her child, were founded such as shared or avoided hard household work, take a rest during midday, wearing leather shoes during evening time and ` Seemantham\u00b4 . Traditions such as dietary precautions and restri ctions of the pregnant woman's intake of water, and meat and frui t, are most likely harmful, since they can result in dehydration and iron and vitamin insuffic iency, especially if the woman is malnourished before the occurrence of her pregnancy . Avoidances of 'jam-packed' buses, as the consumption of saffron for a light skin, and th e different precautions regarding the evil spirits are more complicated to be clear about. If the women are dependent on travelling by bus to i.e. the hospital for some reason, then this practice could be seen as harmful, otherwise it\u00b4s neutral. Saffron itself is not harmful for the woman nor for the baby, but if it preserves biases about peoples\u00b4 values then it can be underst and as a harmful tradition. The fear of evil spirits restricted the woman physically, and someti mes the data showed that it caused feelings of guilt, if she has earlier experienced a miscarri age or stillbirth. It could also restrict the women to their homes, and preserve power relations within the family and the society. This 34 If the pregnant women\u00b4s parents are dead, she stay s in her husband\u00b4s house until delivery time. 27 could also be valid to the practices that the pregn ant women moved back to her parent\u00b4s house during the last month of pregnancy. At a first glan ce this is beneficial for the pregnant women and her child, on the other hand it perhaps maintai ns the power over the young woman. 4.2 DELIVERY Institutional births under supervision by skilled h ealth personnel are today the prevalent norm in the state of Tamil Nadu. The majority, (90.4%), of children in rural Tamil Nadu are today born in a hospital or clinic 35 , (NFHS-3, 2006). In the past the the Tamil childre n were born at home, often under the supervision of a dai, (Mulder , 1995; Van Hollen, 2003). This study indicates that the few deliveries that still occur at home in Kancheepuram are really due to early and unexpected delivery, or non availability of timely transport to the institution. As Chardrika, 28 years old rural women explained; TheOfirstOchild,OtheOboy,OIOdeliveredOonOtheOwayOto OtheOhospital.OTheOsecondO childOwasOaOhomeOdeliveryObecauseOofOtheOfastOcours eOofOeventsOandOitOwasO anOeasyObirth.OTheOthirdOchildOwasOdeliveredOatOthe OhospitalO Only one woman answered that she has planned to giv e birth at home in her mother\u00b4s house, assisted by her sister who is a nurse, because she did not want to deliver at the hospital. One woman mentioned that she delivered her first child at home assisted by a dai, the rest of the respondents stated that they had delivered at a hos pital or Public Health Care centre, (PHC). The exception was the gypsy community, all of whom had delivered at home assisted by the village dai, and I will come back later on to these findings in section, 4:4, regarding the gypsy community. Men were usually not present during the birth. Instead the female relatives supported the pregnant women at the hospital or PHC . The study did not find any taboo against the father being in the delivery room, but by cultural traditions, the men waited outside the delivery room, if he did not stay at ho me. 35 Based on the last 2 births in the 3 years before th e survey, (NFHS-3, 2006). 28 4.3 POSTPARTUM PRACTICES There were many traditions directly after delivery, some harmful and some beneficial. One harmful tradition, that was however diminishing, wa s the practice of three days of initial fast. A small number of women in this study mentioned the practice to avoiding foods or drinks during the first three days after delivery. The giv en reason behind this initial food taboo was to keep the female body dry36 , and by this healing internal wounds, as Daya a ru ral women told; \"AfterObirth,OIOdidOnotOeatOupOtoOthreeOdays,OIOonl yOateOsomeObread,OsoOIOdidOnotObreastOfeedO myObabyOduringOtheseOdays\". This must be seen as harmful since women in genera lly are in need of both food and beverage after a delivery. On e woman had had a drip at the hospital during the initial first three days of fast, since this was a recommendation by the doctor. 4.3.1 VULNERABILITY After delivery the woman and her newborn are seen a s particularly weak and vulnerable 37 . They have to be protected against diseases and evil spirits. Before entering the parent\u00b4s house the first time after delivery, ceremonies against e vil spirits was performed. The first eleven days, the new mother and her baby were recommended to stay indoors, and the majority of the women stated that they stayed inside the house with the baby for at least three months. Exceptions were only made for the baby's bathing, a nd to catch some sunshine since sunshine was believed for good growth of the baby\u00b4s hair. St aying inside at the parent's house provides rest for the new mother, and also a release from ho usehold responsibilities. It can also be seen as an important time for bonding with her baby, as well as protection from transmissible diseases. By viewing it in this way it must seen as beneficiary for the new mother and her baby. But if the practice isolated them and possibl y delayed health care for mother and child, it can be harmful. Protection against evil spirits were very important , since they were seen as even more dangerous than during the pregnancy. Iron items in combination with coral and herbal leaves 36 Postpartum women are believed to be cold and wet, s ince the babies bring the heat from the womb, when leaving the woman. This is referred to the hot and cold theory again. 37 The woman has lost blood (which is seen as warm), and the baby is vulnerable after have left the warm th in the mother\u00b4s womb. 29 were the most commonly used 38 . The baby was believed to be in danger for the evi l eye, `SglyphYz5azar '. The evil eye was thought to enter the house thro ugh jealousy among celebrating visitors, and rituals were performed to prevent the evil eye to enter the house. In spite of all these security measures, the babies got sick from t ime to time. The evil eye was blamed for causing sickness especially high fever in the baby. But other illnesses such as excessive crying, digestive problems were believed to be caus ed by the evil eye. General protection consisted of blessings, twisted black and red strin gs placed around the baby\u00b4s ankle and wrist, and also black dots, (done by a kohl pencil), in th e baby\u00b4s forehead and under the baby\u00b4s foot. Green herbal leaves, ` Veppali\u00b4, and white flowers were placed in the baby's hand s 39 . To cure sick newborn, homemade remedies and temple blessing , were the initial cures provided by the elderly women. As Oma a rural women told me; IOknowOaboutOit.OWhatOkindOofOdiagnosisOofOtheOchil dren.OIfOtheObabyOisO cryingOIOknow.OSometimesOitOisOcold,OandOsometimesO isOfever.OIfOtheObabyOisO cryingOandOhasOfever,OweOgoOtoOtheOhospital,O'ifOit OnotOisOtheOcoldOitemsO a pro cedure called \u00b4 uram \u00b4 relief using the technique of rolling the baby in a long cloth, and turned the baby upside down, and finally shaking it. Most Tamil women were familiar with thi s practice, but few used it. Aanu a rural woman explained the custom with unskilled practice; \"/...sometimesOtheyOdidOnotOknowOhowOtoO do.OThat\u00b4sOwhyOtheyOdoOthis....\" If the baby continued to be sick in spite of this treatment, the women state that they seek care at a hospital or PH C. However some mothers said that they seek healthcare providers' advice in case of any pr oblem with the baby. 4.3.2 IMPURITY AND CLEANSING As I mentioned in the background chapter, childbirt h is linked with pollution, as the women are seen as be in a state of impurity during the po stpartum period,(Lauderdale, 2008).There are therefore several concerns and strict rules reg arding this unclean period, (Jeffery, 1989). 38 The belief in iron and steel was earlier also comm on in the Nordic countries hundred years ago,(H\u00f6jeb erg, 2000). For example in Sweden they put a knife of st eel in the newborn babies cradle, and also nails of steel were fastened in the threshold, so no troll could l ay hands on the baby. 39 They use these protective items until the child is around one year\u00b4s old. 30 Bathing of mother and baby is a general practice, s ince it helped them to shift into cleanliness. The bathing of the child can also be seen as an ind icator of its separation as a part of the mother. The bathing for the new mother can be harmful if it leads to lower abdomen infections by unclean water; on the other hand clea nness keeps diseases away if the water is clean. The same must be valid for bathing the newbo rn, unless it will not lead to cooling and hypothermia 40 as an effect, then it is harmful. The baby was not considered as an individual and no t a member of society, until a certain ceremony, ` tiddukkarittal \u00b4 was carried out. Prior to this day, the baby rema ins unnamed and was dressed in second-hand clothes. Eleven days aft er delivery, the baby was given a purifying bath, new clothes, and was given its name , and then the baby became a member of society with its own identity. 4.3.3 MOTHER \u00b4S AND BABY \u00b4S DIET In Tamil Nadu it's believed that a great deal of th e woman's body heat is thought to be lost during the birth, and therefore women have to avoid all kinds of coldness, (Lauderdale, 2008; Van Hollen, 2003). The avoidance of cold foods mwas widespread and mentioned by all those interviewed in the study. The new mother's diet and behaviour was also believed to influence the quality of her milk, and for this reason, when breast-fed babies suffered from respiratory infections the mother's milk was often blamed for b eing \"too cold\". All household work that included water was also avoided for this reason. Eq ually if the babies got red rashes on the skin, it was believed that the breast feeding woman had eaten hot food items. Due to traditional practices breastfeeding had not started until the fourth day following delivery. Colostrums feeding 41 had been withheld, since the first milk have been associated with impurity, and believed to cause sickness to th e baby, (Van Hollen, 2003). This harmful tradition is something that has been given high pri ority in different health programs in Kancheepuram. Almost all interviewed mothers stated that they had started to breast feed within three hours after delivery, that is to say; they colostrum feed their babies. However 40 A condition in which body temperature drops below that required for normal and body functions. 41 The mother\u00b4s first milk, raw milk, contains a lot of antibodies and vitamins from the mother; it's pr oduced during pregnancy and comes before the established m ilk production. 31 sometimes I got a feeling that the respondents gave me a 'correct answer' on this matter and I often reflected on the degree of truthfulness, in r egard to this question. Prelacteal42 feeding to newborn with honey and donkey milk was commonly used by the grandmother's whom have seen generations of people who have undergone these procedures and they stated that they were all fine. Donkey mil k was given to prevent sickness such as throat problems and ` chevappu \u00b443 . All men in the focus groups interviews stated tha t they had had donkey milk as a child, and since they were hea lthy, they repeated it with their own newborns. \"WeOgiveOsomeOdonkeyOmilkOtoOtheObabyOforOprotectio nOagainstOsickness.OEverybodyO hereOhasOhadOdonkeyOmilkOwhenOtheyOwereObabies,OsoO theObabyOwillObeOhealthyOandOactOinO response\".(Vardhaman).O Honey was given to infants for cleansing purposes 44 , and contributed to some kind of circulation in the mout h, resulting in freely speaking, \" sweetO words \". These practices can be harmful, since newborns n eed the mother\u00b4s breast milk, and to give anything else then breast milk or baby formula disrupt further breast feeding. Summarym In Kancheepuram the woman and her newborn are seen as particularly weak and vulnerable 45 , after delivery. They have to be protected against d iseases and evil spirits. Explanations of causes of illness and death demonstrated the worldv iew of the Tamils, .i.e. holistic and magico-religious, as earlier mentioned in the theor y chapter. The newly delivered woman was also seen as polluted after delivery, and during th e postpartum period traditional practices and rituals such as purification rituals incorporating the woman, into another phase of her life, motherhood. The baby was not considering as an indi vidual and not a member of the society, until eleven days then the baby became a member of the society with its own identity. Since the women breast feed their children, food taboos s trengthening its position during this time period. Prelacteal46 feeding to newborn with honey and donkey milk was commonly used. 42 To give newborn babies feeds like honey, water, gl ucose water or cow/buffalo milk, before the mother' s milk comes in. 43 Skin problems, red colour in baby\u00b4s skin 44 To get rid of meconium, that is the earliest stool s of an infant. 45 The woman has lost blood (which is seen as warm), and the baby is vulnerable after have left the warm th in the mother\u00b4s womb. 46 Traditionally a new born is given prelactal feeds like honey, water, glucose water or top milk, befor e the mother's milk comes in. 32 This section showed that some traditions were harmf ul for both the mother and her child. It also showed that if information and education is gi ven to the mother\u00b4s, such as the given information regarding colostrums feeding could dimi nish harmful traditions, since almost all interviewed women state that they had colostrums fe d their babies. 4.4 GYPSY COMMUNITY A section of India\u00b4s population is classified as \"t ribal\", and these are groups which traditionally have not been integrated into the cas te hierarchy, and have much the same status as `untouchables\u00b4. Tribal people are seen by others Indians as simple forest dwellers who are the descendants of the original population of India , (Shurmer-Smith, 2000).There are different clans of gypsies in India, such as Sapera, (snake c harmers)-live mainly in Rajastan- and the Narikravar in the South,(Kenrick, 2004). During my stay in Kancheepuram I occasionally ran into these gypsy communities. Some groups are still nomads or have been so until the relatively recent past. I choose to present my find ings from this gypsy village since they have been set aside in the modernisation of obstetrics i n Kancheepuram district. They represent an exception from the rest of my respondents, and I wa nted to show that even Tamil Nadu as a whole can show very good statistics, there are large disparities in the society, as I mentione d earlier in the background chapter. The gypsy community which I visit and where I carri ed out my interviews consisted of 40 households, and their main occupation was pearl wor k alongside catching birds. They have slowly started to adapt to being settled. Their chi ldren attended school, and their pregnant women received antenatal care provided by a nearby village health nurse. Because of their earlier lifestyle of travelling the women haven\u00b4t a ttended any antenatal check-ups during their pregnancies. Guiding during pregnancy was still pre dominantly provided by the elderly women in the village. Home deliveries were still th e common procedure in the village, assisted by the dai. The village leader also claime d that he had assisted ten births, but I am doubtful about the degree of truth in that statemen t. The dai in the gypsy community has inherited the oc cupation from her mother who has performed the same task, and she had obtained her t raditional knowledge by practical 33 experience 47 . As Komela the dai told; \"IOhaveOlearnedOitObyOpracticalOlifeOproblems...one ObyO one...oneObyOone....stepObyOstep...IOhaveOlearned,O IOhaveOlearnedOfromOallOexperience\" It was very uncommon that the people in the village went t o hospital for any minor illnesses, for that reason; it was claimed a life threatening situation . To solve obstetric problems during labour, traditio nal practices were first tried. To correct mal presentations 48 , the dai used her hands to get the baby in to the right position. If this did not succeed, she told me, that she recommended hospital isation. On the question if she had delivered any breech and/or footling presentations, she told me that living babies always come in head presentation, footling presentation represe nted dead babies. Komala the dai explained; \"/...ifOtheyOdieOinOtheOstomach,OtheyOalwaysOcomeOo utOwithOtheOfeetOfirst,OotherwiseOtheyOcomeO withOtheOheadOfirst\".O This part was very touching for me, since these pre sentations are trickier to deliver then head presentations, but in Sweden a ll babies in this position are supposed to survive. After delivery the gypsy women also stayed inside t heir homes. Two-three days was most commonly, and after that time period, they could le ave the house. Also in this gypsy village there was a strong belief in evil spirits, and meas ures were also taken for protection. The gypsies tackle the problem as the rest of the inter viewed respondents 49 in my study. 5 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK In the previous chapter my findings and analysis we re presented and discussed. In this chapter I will start with a presentation of my constructed \u00b4'Motherhood during a transitional period' theory, and continue with a presentation of Abrams, (1982) Historical Sociology Theory to which my constructed theory is compared to. Since t his thesis has a grounded theory 47 Being a dai was and still are a part of a family t radition in India. Young women were introduced into the lore by their elders, however many of them have gain exp erience by watching deliveries, and have no educati onal training, (Mulder, 1995). Most dais are from poor b ackgrounds and from a low caste, (Jeffery, 1989). 48 The head is the most common and preferred presenta tion of the baby during delivery.. Mal position and mal presentations of the foetus are complications durin g delivery and present the midwife with a challenge during labour. Recognition and diagnosis should be detecte d before delivery by antenatal check-ups since some of them demand caesareans. 49 Hindu blessings and choral dots in the forehead, an d black and rep twisted ropes around waist, wrists and ankles. 34 approach, and the theory is grounded from data, the theoretical framework is presented after the chapter regarding findings and analysis. 5.1 MOTHERHOOD DURING A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD The title of the theory was inspired by the Tamil w omen\u00b4s span between two worldviews, i.e. shift in systems of knowledge about the body in gen eral and women\u00b4s conceptualizations and experiences of childbearing and giving birth. As I presented in the previous chapter concerning findings and analyses, several tradition al beliefs and practices still exist in Kancheepuram, and many of the rural Tamil women sti ll adhere to them and take several of them seriously. These practices and beliefs run in parallel with the modernisation and transformation of obstetrics. The theory of 'Mother hood during a transitional period' will explain why the rural women keep to their old emoti onal cultural beliefs and practices in spite of the modernisation of obstetrics, that are ration al with a target focus, they today are a part of. Although several of the traditions are harmful, I have found, two different explanations to this phenomenon and will discuss and develop these ideas; The Tamil women are in a transition phase between t wo worldviews. Modernization of a society and its inhabitants take time and at varying speed. Below I will elaborate on my two propositions. Proposition: The Tamil women are in a transition phase between two worldviews. From the collected data it emerged that all those i nterviewed have found it necessary to explain the phenomena of nature and to offer soluti ons to life\u00b4s mysteries .i.e. they have their own old worldview of childbearing and giving birth. The women, their families and society have their own historical experiences, and these hi storical experiences are crucial to have, so they can use them and compare with the new `modern\u00b4 obstetrics they are offered. If they do not have this historical experience what then to co mpare with? The women cannot change their worldviews if they are not convinced/assured that the new worldview is superior and can offer something better than their old worldview. Th ey need to experience that the stillbirth and/or infant's mortality will decline, or that the y feel healthier, as a result of modern obstetrics care. This will only happened when the e xplanatory power has been exhausted from the old beliefs. Once this has happen they will acc ept and change their worldview, Abrams, 35 (1982) theory 'Historical Sociology' supports this. The women are so to say in a transition period between two paradigms. Proposition:m Modernization of a society and its inhabitants take time and at varying speed. m But these paradigms are slow to change, since old e xisting traditions are deeply rooted in the culture. On many occasions old traditions prevent n ew experiences from being made, for instance, if the head of the household decides that it is not necessary to visit hospital then the benefits of modern obstetrics will not be discovere d. Traditions could moreover have more than one functi on. For example the widespread practice that the pregnant woman leaves her husband\u00b4s house and return to her parent\u00b4s house. The manifest function is to provide the pregnant woman with rest and to be nourished. But there can also be a latent function behind this tradition , such as preserve power for the elderly rural women, and fit the pregnant women into a system of values and norms. And this latent function slows down the speed of the transformation s. Change also depends on factors involved such as; pe oples understanding of health, diseases or illness, i.e. people's health belief systems. In Ka ncheepuram the causes of illness were categorized as natural illnesses, or illnesses sent by supernatural forces, such as evil spirits. Natural illness reflects the symbiosis and balance between the human being and her physical environment. (Andrews, 2008). Tamil people\u00b4s explan ations of the causes of illness demonstrated the prevailing holistic worldview 50 . When all elements are in balance and in harmony; then the system is healthy, but if one ele ment is unbalanced, all other parts are affected. This implies that many parts must be reap praised before the transition of a new society has taken place. Since all parts are interl inked you cannot just change one part of the paradigm, in this case the modernisation of the obs tetrics. In general, to change only one part of a society without putting that change in a wider cultural context will make the change of that society's worldview slow. To put this into the Tamil context, to change the obstetric care without considering that society needs to absorb th e change in the society's culture will make the transition period significantly longer. 50 In the holistic paradigm the forces of nature itse lf must be kept in natural balance or harmony. Huma n life is only one aspect of the nature and a part of the gen eral order of cosmos, and everything in the univers e has a place and a role and together they make the univers e complete. (Andrews, 2008) 36 5.2 ABRAMS HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY THEORY I will continue my theoretical discussion and also bring forward Abrams Historical Sociology Theory with the intention to find support for my 'M otherhood during a transitional period' theory. Abrams (1982, p. 3), Historical Sociology T heory, was developed to understand how societies, sociologically, are formed as a process historically by individuals that in turn are formed historically by society. WeOcanOconstructOnewOworldsObutOonOtheObasisOandOwi thinOtheOframeworkOofO whatOourOpredecessorsOhaveOconstructedOforOus.OOnOt hatObasisOandOwithinO thatOframeworkOtheOcontentOofOourOactivityOmayOreMm akeOorOunMmakeOtheO institutionsOthatOsurroundOus.O Abrams theory explains why societies still hold on to their old traditions and beliefs although they are in transition. Abrams theory compares a so ciety\u00b4s development with a child's development to an adult. He is pointing out the nec essity of an individual's adolescence; that is to say the transitional phase. The period during the adolescence gives the individual time for reflection and comparison of its history as a c hild, also what lays ahead, i.e. the life as an adult, since the adolescence is a time of searching . \" CreativityOfeedsOonOexperienceOnotOwill \" (Abrams, 1982, p. 255). His theory also discusses why of necessity it takes generations to adopt and incorporate new concepts into a society's worldview. Abrams differs between biological and sociological generations, with this he means familial and cultur al generations. A familial generation is based on age. A sociological cultural generation is the time between significant changes in worldviews. Abrams claims that the driving force be hind the development of a society is connected to the aging of the individual. The world view that parents pass on to their children is the worldview they received from their parents, together with the changes in values and norms that life experience has provided. This suppo rts my own theory above when I claim that change takes time. Adams leading idea is that society goes through con stant alteration and this is the same as the individuals searching for their own identity. The p rocess towards finding his or her identity is the same as the change in society. This idea also s tipulates that the changes of the individuals affect society. The changes in society then in turn affect the individuals. This interaction is a 37 process that takes time. Individuals need to experi ence changes before they can reshape their values and norms. Cultural change to society relies in turn on new values and norms. Abrams theory,(1982), explains why harmful traditio ns and beliefs can emerge. He claims that individuals form their worldview from personal experiences gained through life. However Abrams Theory does not give any suggestion how to avoid these harmful traditions emerging. This could be seen as a shortcoming of hi s theory. If gained experiences are misinterpreted, and traditions or behaviours are fo rmed from such misunderstandings, this may lead to harmful traditions and beliefs. One exa mple could be the withholding of colostrums for newborn babies since the women feare d that colostrums caused diarrhoea and nausea for the baby. This belief could, for instanc e, have its origin from breast feeding a newborn, in combination with sickness, and then bee n misinterpreted as colostrums causing the problem. 5.3 RESEARCH FRONTIER REVIEW Now when the theory has been presented the literatu re review follows. Since this study is inductive, and has a grounded theory approach, the literary review is presented in the chapter following findings, analysis, and theory, this in u nderstanding of the nature of the grounded theory. Indian women`s particular beliefs, traditions, and taboos during pregnancy and postpartum are well documented, (Choudhry, 1997; Nielsen Bruun, Hollen, 2003). Especially the research about fo od habits in relationship to childbearing and postpartum period in India are well documented, as well as the concept of \u00b4hot and cold\u00b4, (Ferro-Luzzi, 1980; Pool, 1987; Zeitlyn, 1997). The se beliefs have also been widely reported from other parts of Southeast Asian countries (Wils on, 1980), Latin America (Messer, 1987) and Iran, (Ahlqvist, 2000). m Among the food avoidances of pregnant women in Indi a and Tamil Nadu, papaya is the most feared food item, (Choudhry, 1997; Ferro-Luzzi, 198 0). Ferro-Luzzi, found in his study, of 1200 women from all districts in Tamil Nadu, that 8 2% of the women excluded papaya during childbearing, since papaya is \"accused of\" causing abortion, as it's classified as very `hot\u00b4. He also found that even men declared that they felt ho t after eating papaya. Adebiyi, (2002), 38 tested rats to ascertain rats if papaya consumption was unsafe in pregnancy, since his theory was that papaya could provoke uterine stimulation, and miscarriage. The findings showed that consumption of ripe papaya during pregnancy may not be dangerous; however unripe or semi- ripe papaya produced uterine contractions, and shou ld therefore be avoided in pregnancy (ibid). Theilgaard-Andersen, (2003), on the other h and found that very few women excluded papaya during pregnancy due to its `heating\u00b4 effect on the mother and her unborn baby, the reason behind excluding papaya was vomiting and \u00b4ga s producing\u00b4. Due to rapid social and economic transformations in many parts of the world, and the `export of Western obstetrics\u00b4, the focus has changed more into the topic of the shift from home births and traditional birth attendants versus the moderni zation of obstetrics, (Liamputtong, 2005b; Nielsen Bruun, 1998a; Ram, 1994; Van Hollen, 2003). Van Hollen, (2003) ,discusses how this shift from o ne institutional site (i.e. the family and the midwife), to another institutional site (i.e. the p ublic hospitals as site of both the state and biomedicine 51 ) affect the poor women's lives. The central theme for her discussions is how poor women in Tamil Nadu made decisions about what kind of care to seek during childbirth, and the issue of what kind of `choice\u00b4 they have. S he also highlights the shift in systems of knowledge about the body in general, and also how n ew concepts of maternity emerged in the context of the modernisation of childbirth in a com munity in transition. Her observations are in accordance with my own observations during my re search period in Kancheepuram. The influence of western medicine was very perceptible when I talked with the rural Tamil women, and traditional medicine was often portrayed as `backwards, old-fashioned, unhealthy and uncivilized\u00b4. Several rural women were uncomfor table about the question regarding the elderly women's advice to them during childbearing and postpartum period, and laughed embarrassedly when they admitted that they in reali ty followed their guidance. I interpreted that traditional medicine was something that the ru ral women adhere to but were ashamed of. These rural women live in a passage/threshold betwe en old cultural traditions and new western medicine, and the woman may be torn between traditional ways and the western medicine. Also Ram, (1994) discusses the women\u00b4s responses to modern medical `management\u00b4 of pregnancy and birth in Tamil Nadu. He argues that w omen\u00b4s decisions, whether or not to seek 51 Bio-medicine; medical system of Western civilizati on /medicine, \"modern medicine\". 39 medical care during pregnancy and where to give bir th, are based in their earlier experiences of how they had been treated by higher class and ca ste power. Ram,(1994) ,also pointed out the enormous tensions that are created for the wome n since they are required to mediate between world views. Poor and low caste women are t argets for new medical reforms because they are \u00b4traditional\u00b4 in their modes of childbirth , childcare and hygiene, and they still derive their basic ideas of femininity and maternity from archaic religious and cultural currents. Older forms of hierarchy are mapped into new versio ns, with high caste intolerance of impurity, pollution and medical science. The beliefs and practices of Tamil pregnant women h ave also been documented, (Nielsen Bruun, 1998a). She studied different aspects of ant enatal care in rural Tamil Nadu, with regard to background and risk factors for maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality 52 . Her findings were similar to mine, i.e. that the wo men were very much concerned about their pregnancies, and have many strategies to ensure a s afe delivery and a healthy child. Bruun- Nielsen,(ibid), found nevertheless that some of tho se strategies were conflicting, and the Tamil women had to choose to prioritize between a s afe delivery or a healthy child. Many women then gave priority to their own health, since they believed that they could always improve the health of the child after birth. My ana lysis did not indicate this conflict. 6 CONCLUSION Despite rapid health transition and the extension o f obstetric care in Tamil Nadu, the rural women still adhere to several traditional beliefs a nd practices in regard to childbearing and the first period after delivery. In order to understand the underlying causes behind these traditions and beliefs, the study therefore began with an inve stigation of rural women in Kancheepuram. The second stage analysed what possible implication s the adherence to these traditions could have for the rural Tamil women and their children. First of all the analysis showed that the old tradi tions claimed to safeguard the life and well- being of the baby. Although the data collected show ed that some of the beliefs and practices them were harmful others were harmless or beneficia l for the women and their babies. 52 Maternal mortality; the death of a woman while pre gnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy , irrespective of the cause of the death 40 To answer the second research question why the rura l women in Tamil Nadu hold on to these sometimes harmful traditions in spite of the modern isation of obstetrics, a grounded theory termed, 'Motherhood during a transitional period' w as constructed. The theory explains that the Tamil women are in a transition period between two worldviews, and also that modernization of a society and its inhabitants take s time and is at a varying speed. The Tamil woman, their families and their society h ave their own old view of childbearing and giving birth. At the same time these women are under pressure to be `modern\u00b4, and are told to attend maternal care and come to the hospit al and deliver, to attend the `new\u00b4 worldview. This is equivalent with Abrams Historica l Sociology theory that compares a society\u00b4s development with a child's development to an adult. He points out the necessity of an individual's adolescence; that is to say the tra nsitional phase, a time to reflect and compare. This is the same for the Tamil women, therefore the y need varying time to compare the old and new, and experience the new maternal care they are offered. The presence of the deeply rooted traditions in com bination with the modern 'top-down' maternity care put the women in a very difficult po sition; therefore these women are torn between traditional ways and the western medicine. By providing cultural sensitive care, we can respond to the Tamil women\u00b4s cultural needs, an d also enhancing quality humanistic and holistic care to the Tamil people in their own cult ure. You may consider that this is something that the leaders of the society may have overlooked , in their ambition to show the world declining numbers of maternal and infant mortality. You may argue that, the leaders have not been capable of integrating the culture into the mo dernisation of obstetrics, and therefore not been able to effectively change these harmful tradi tions and beliefs. C ulture has always been central to development and must be integrated into development policy and programs since culture is of such a fundamental part of people's lives. At a national level, the Indian government need to raise the status of women and gi rls and work against women\u00b4s low status in the society. The government also need to offer e ducation for women and girls, since an educated mother is less likely to die during childb irth. And with education perhaps we also will see a change in the deep-rooted cultural belie f that \"Saffron will give a fair baby\"! 7 RECOMMENDATIONS The Tamil rural women of today live their lives in a passage/threshold between old traditions and Western obstetrics. They also live between an o ld and new worldview regarding their 41 bodies, childbearing and giving birth. I therefore suggest one way of how to provide cultural sensitive health care to the rural Tamil women by a n ethno nursing method, derived from Leininger\u00b4s Culture Care Theory, (Leininger, 2006). It was developed in the mid-1950s and early 1960s to find ways to give care to people who have different values and life styles. Among several nursing theories and methods I choose Leininger since this is one of few that include cultural competence 53 , that is to say, explore the relationship of cultu re and care, and the focus also includes care for families, groups, communities, culture and institutions. Cultural Care is a holistic worldview, as I ear lier described in the theoretical chapter, and this fits well with Leningers\u00b4 theory, (2006), therefore she points out that careOalwaysO occursOinOaOculturalOcontext , and information on culture is essential for holis tic assessment of an individual, family, or community. The method wil l provide culturally congruent care, therefore many more ethical and moral issues will b e identified related to culture, and that will lead to a request and need for dramatic new po licies and ways to serve culture. Leningers\u00b4 theory, (ibid), demands the health pract ioners to individualize their care practices and standards, to be able to work against harmful t raditions such as food taboos for pregnant and postpartum women. Practical examples at grass-r ote level could be: education of health care workers to provide knowledge and understanding of the traditions, awareness-raising in societies of problems associated with harmful tradi tion, and mobilization of people to work against these harmful practices and beliefs. The na tional leaders must start to draw attention to gender inequality and power relations that are wide spread and deep-rooted in many cultures. Gender equality is a human right, and women's empow erment is critical for promoting human development. The leaders in the global association must also keep in mind not to overlook the 53 Cultural competence is a set of behaviours that tr anscend mere good intentions such as accepting that cultural differences exist, and willingness to expl ore the client\u00b4s own strengths and adaptive capabil ities (De Chesnay, 2008) 42 culture, since people and culture are interlinked a nd a part of each other and you may argue that it is complex to 'import' western health care as a blue print to developing countries. 43 8 REFERENCES Abrams, P.

Have yo u `S ELVI \u00b4 A RURAL HINDU WOMEN Below is a short novel that describes in general te rms the women I meet during my stay in Kancheepuram. I have used my findings to invent the story, and I know it is risky to generalize, but I will take the chance. O Look whom is coming down the dust track! It\u00b4s Selvi a 20 year rural Hindu woman who lives here in Tamil Nadu. She looks very exhausted in her advanced pregnancy. She is expecting her second child within a month, and she probably y earns that the pregnancy will soon end. She is married two years, and lives together with h er husband in the nearby rural village. The extended family also consists of her husbands elder ly parent\u00b4s and his brother with his wife and their children, a total number of eight persons . The village consists of fifty households', and the main source of income among the men is agri culture. Selvi herself is `just a housewife\u00b4, and has finished school after six years , at an age of twelve years. Today she is on her way to the village health nurse for an antenatal check up. She tries to go every month as the health personnel recommended, bu t sometimes her mother in law thinks it\u00b4s unnecessary, and then she continues with house hold work instead. She really does not know why she has to go to for these check-ups, but she has heard it has something to do with the growth of her baby. Sometimes she even gets an injection, she does not remember why, but that doesn't matter, it\u00b4s western medicine, so it must be good. On the other hand she does not like the black tablets they want her to take. T he elderly women in the village have told her they are too `hot\u00b4, so she will definitely avoid th em. She is hot enough! Don\u00b4t the skilled health personnel know that she is in a hot state du ring her pregnancy, and if she takes even more \u00b4hot\u00b4 tablets she will risk losing her baby? T hat undesirable experience she already has had. Last year she gave birth to a stillborn baby b oy, just before she was going to celebrate `Seemantham\u00b4. What a sad memory. She had followed all the advice from her mother in law and the rest of the elderly women in the village. She had avoided hard household work, a nd also avoided of water, since she didn\u00b4t want to get sick or bring coldness to the baby. Som etimes even her mother in law shared her heavy household duties with her. She slept on the l eft side, she is sure about that. Avoided travel by bus, solar eclipses, and the hardest of a ll, to remember all food restrictions. In the beginning it was no problem since she had had morni ng sickness and vomiting, but later on! 60 She couldn\u00b4t eat fruits such as papaya, mango, guav a, jackfruit or pineapple since they cause abortion. She also kept to strict vegetarian food e ven if she yearned for chicken or mutton. Her wish for a fair skinned baby made it easy to av oid all black items such as black grapes and coffee. Her neighbours even recommended saffronOforOaOfairObaby , that's why she started to eat `the read flower\u00b4 in the sixth month of her pregnancy, and she would continue until delivery time. Selvi was convinced that the evils have caught her baby! Also the elders in her village were of the same conviction. Everybody knows that evils are very attracted to pregnant women since the women send out a special smell. She had avoided going outside during the evenings and night time, and she had protected herself with herb al leaves and coral, but anyway! It must have happened during midday, at 12.30. She was told to stay inside and rest after lunch, and avoid all kinds of households work, but one day she just has to leave the house since a big snake had entered her house. The more that she thin ks about it, it must have happened that day! Shortly after she started get labour pains, an d delivered a son at home with assistance of the dai in the village. No, she does not want to th ink more about it! Soon it\u00b4s time for her traditional pregnancy ritual called `Seemantham\u00b4 in Tamil. Every pregnant woman is celebrated in her ninth month of pregnancy. All peo ple in the village will celebrate and honour her with food and gifts. The day after she will leave her husband\u00b4s house an d return to her relatives and her parent\u00b4s house to stay there until delivery and the first mo nths afterwards. She aches already! At her parent\u00b4s house she is allowed to rest and she will have some more food. Her mother and her sisters will follow her to the hospital to deliver this time. She feels a little bit afraid of this, t o be alone at the hospital, and nobody that cares abo ut her, but anyway, she will manage. Then she will become a mother, and the other women will respect her a little bit more! The first time she is restricted to stay inside her parent's house, since she and the baby are very polluted and unclean. They are also very vulnerable and attractive for evils, so her mother has promised to perform all kinds of different rituals to protect her and her baby. Of course they will perform `vately\u00b4, and also put black and red s tring around the baby\u00b4s waist, wrist\u00b4s and neck, and of course put a black kohl dot in the bab y's forehead. The worst problem is the celebrating relatives. Think if they bring the evil eye with them when they enter the house, God help us! But it will certainly help if we perfo rm some blessings for the baby. 61 An elderly woman is already asked to come and help her with the daily herbal baths and another woman will give massage to herself and her baby. After eleven days they will also give the baby it\u00b4s name and she is already looking forward to this. She will of course breast feed her baby. The elderly women have told her not to give the first milk, but the health personnel told her to do so, and she thinks she wil l follow this advice. Her mother in law will of course give the newborn baby some honey for `swe et voice\u00b4, and donkey milk as protection against sickness. She will agree to this since she also has had this as a child, and she is strong and healthy, and has a nice voice. She is a little bit worried about giving a cold to the baby and just has to remember to dress herself in warm c lothes and avoid all kinds of cold items. Oh dear, we cannot delay her, she is already late a nd her mother in law is probably already annoyed. She moves away from us, but she will alway s stay in my "}
