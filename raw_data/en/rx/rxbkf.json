Don't let this stop you \u2014 there are other routes to reach us. Please review these [alternate route driving directions](https://www.esalen.org/visit/planning-your-visit#alternate-route-south) and allow for a little extra travel time while on your transformational and healing journey. We look forward to welcoming you to Esalen. We offer [massage](#massage) as well as a variety of [alternative healing sessions](#alt-services) both to workshop guests and Day Pass Visitors. Our approach is one of working with each other as human beings, meeting in the present moment, listening, loving, and responding to what emerges naturally. Our practitioners strive to empower you to regain a sense of harmony and to awaken inner resources for healing. Because all of our sessions tend to sell out, we recommend booking your reservations at least three weeks in advance. Co-created in the late 1960s by Peggy Horan, Deborah Medow, Brita Ostrom, and Vicki Topp, Esalen massage as \"an inspired and ever-evolving integration of sensory awareness, healing arts, yoga, tai chi, meditation, body-mind integration, and mindfulness.\" Learn more about the history and legacy of Esalen massage in [this one-hour film](https://www.esalen.org/videos/esalens-massage-legacy). Offered in limited numbers to visitors who are not already on campus for a workshop or overnight experience, the pass gives you access to the Esalen grounds including the hot springs from 8:30 am - 8:00 pm. Please be sure to check out at the gate when you depart to avoid a late fee. Enjoy your massage or alternative session, a full buffet-style lunch, and complimentary access to any open classes taking place during the hours of your visit. Prices vary depending on the service you select. $230* for workshop guests / $357* for Day Pass Visitors An Esalen Massage is an inward journey rather than purely a therapeutic treatment. Through long strokes, a slow pace, and pauses, you are invited to return to your natural state of balance and alignment. Transformation occurs not through deep-tissue work but rather through an active participation between giver and receiver. As your practitioner's hands direct your attention, this awareness evokes relaxation and change. Then your practitioner can apply deeper, more specific work as needed. The massage developed here at the hot springs recognizes that the body releases into pleasurable sensation. The body and mind are one. Sessions are 75-minutes long and take place in semi-private rooms at the baths, or weather permitting, outside on the massage deck. We recommend arriving to the baths at least 10 minutes prior to your massage reservation time to shower and soak, keeping in mind it may take 5-10 minutes to walk down the hill from your guest room or parking spot. Please note: the baths are clothing optional and gender-inclusive, including changing areas and restrooms. Leave valuables locked safely in your room or your car, as there are no lockers in the changing areas. We recommend removing silver jewelry before soaking, as the minerals in the water will cause it to tarnish. Following your session, please feel free to enjoy a post-massage soak after showering off the massage oil. Starting at $260* for workshop guests / Staring at $354* for Day Pass Visitors For guests staying at Esalen and Day Pass Visitors, we offer a variety of alternative services to deepen your experience, enhance self-awareness, and facilitate healing for your body, mind, and spirit. Options include: Please view the menu for more detailed information about the sessions, practitioners, and pricing. You must book an Alternative Service as a Day Pass Visitor unless you already have a reservation for a workshop or overnight stay. *Price includes 18% gratuity for the service.
