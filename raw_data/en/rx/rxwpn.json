Meditation doesn't only have a spiritual benefit, but a worldly benefit as well. Meditation is one of the more important aspects of a successful lifestyle. Meditation has been around for thousands of years and just recently have scientists started to see the benefits for so many aspects of life that affect both body and mind. Multiple studies have shown that meditation can help reduce levels of depression and anxiety, if and when exposed to external influences. Anxiety and depression can place an individual in a state where physicians and psychologists could get involved if not treated early on. Islam has a history of meditation as well. It is known that the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), used to spend hours on Mt. Noor away from society contemplating the situation Makkah was in at that time, this was his form of meditation. Here are some reasons why meditation should be incorporated into our lives: Meditation calms the mind Stress reduction is the key to meditation's beneficial effect on the health of your brain. It's not only a healthy diet full of vitamins that keeps the brain running smoothly, it's external as well. We are very busy people and our lives are filled with distractions and stressors, we tend to get carried away by negative external influences but if and when you learn how to meditate a few minutes a day, the brain unwinds and pushes away stressors. With a clear mind, it can find positive solutions to distractions and problems that arise as an example. Lowers high blood pressure According to the American Heart Association, stress is the body's natural alarm system releasing adrenaline that causes acceleration in your breathing, quickening of the heart rate and rise of blood pressure. A study in 2012 showed African-Americans with heart disease who practiced Transcendental Meditation regularly were 48 percent less likely to have a heart attack or stroke compared to African-Americans who attended a health education class for over five years. Relaxation and rejuvenation of the mind and body Not all medication is sitting down and listening to your breathing or calm music of nature. There's Tai Chi for example, a type of meditation using your body to move in slow and gentle movements reaching certain positions that require balance and concentration. Praying in Islam is a form of meditation with certain movements that also help the body positively, better posture, straightening of the back and easing of tense muscles on legs and feet as well. Balances the body system There is scientific evidence resulting from MRI scans of people who are meditating at the time, there was a significant increase in activity areas that control metabolism and heart rate. Meditation also reduces both the experience of pain and manages stress resulting from having pain. Helps individuals with chronic pain Acute pain is easily explained as getting an injury or surgery, time passes and it is healed, chronic is when the pain doesn't go away. With chronic pain, the mental processes can alter sensory phenomena, leading to depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and a heightened awareness of the body. How? With meditation it's possible that the pain intensity is lowered, the cycles of pain escalation can be moderated and the pain can be less intrusive on one's life. It's taking control of the pain and emotions that is vital. How do you know if meditation is working? It is when you get feelings of a calm and steady heaviness, while feeling warm and light at the same time, sounds are lowered and the body is falling into pre-sleep phase of clarity. There are many types of meditation such as yoga, zen meditation, transcendental meditation, repetitive prayer, mindfulness meditation, guided meditations and so on. Many physicians recommend to their patients the importance of not over stressing and trying to relax. Meditation and its types can help in more ways than we can ever know. Check out your nearest fitness center and ask about the types of classes available that include meditation. The power to change is in you alone, meditation is only a means to help you do that. \u2014 [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b1fdd8d7d49fc2c5c8ddd4f1d0c3d0d3dfd4c6c29fd2dedc) Why meditation is good for you Why meditation is good for you You may have heard by now how meditation is finding its way into the lives of people in search of tranquility, peace of mind and a life with less stress in it.

Recipes for Success: Chef Gaurav Kakkar offers Michelin-starred Mayfair hotspot Gymkhana opened its first overseas outpost in Riyadh earlier this year and has already found itself a loyal following in the Kingdom. The restaurant's Indian-born executive chef Gaurav Kakkar \u2014 who was instrumental in the pre-opening of M\u00f6venpick Hotel Riyadh, followed by the pre-opening and rebranding of the 5-star voco Riyadh \u2014 is especially excited about the response it has received in Riyadh so far. \"We are blessed in a way that the locals and expats in Riyadh are no strangers to Indian cuisine. The response has been phenomenal. I'm enjoying it,\" Kakkar tells Arab News. Kakkar credits his mother as one of the main inspirations behind his passion for cooking. But not in the way you might expect. \"Honestly, I got into cooking because my mother was a very bad cook,\" he says. \"So, whenever my mom would cook, I'd eventually end up in the kitchen cooking something for myself. And then my father kind of encouraged me to experiment with a few things. And eventually I developed a knack for it.\" Here, Kakkar talks about learning to cook with meat as a vegetarian, his working style and his love for Thai cuisine. When you started out, what was the most common mistake you made? I come from a vegetarian family. So the challenge used to be handling different kinds of meat. Also, back in the day, we didn't have access to classic European vegetables like asparagus or artichokes, so learning how to work with them was also a challenge; there's a big difference between knowing it in theory and doing it in the kitchen. What's your top tip for amateurs? First of all, if you're cooking, don't just do it to feed yourself. Cook because you're passionate about it, because you enjoy eating. I also tell people not to be scared of experimenting; there's no right or wrong. What one ingredient can instantly approve any dish? I don't think there's any one magic ingredient. It's about the freshness and the quality. That's the most important detail, whether it's a particular vegetable or a particular type of meat. Also, getting the right amount of seasoning, whatever that seasoning is, makes or breaks a dish. When you go out to eat, do you find yourself critiquing the food? Or can you switch off and just eat? Honestly, I can eat anything and everything. Anything that's nice and flavorful works for me; simple or complex doesn't matter. So I try not to get into critiquing, unless the it's extremely bad. But if it's fully prepared decently I'm not someone who goes out and kind of picks on people's food. What's your favorite cuisine? I actually love Thai food and Thai flavors. In particular, I love the flavors of lemongrass, coconut and galangal. Because I lived in South India, I have an inclination towards South Indian cuisine and South Asian cuisines in general. What's your go-to dish if you have to cook something quickly at home? When I need to make something quick, I love a simple khichdi (a dish of rice and lentils) with some nice Indian homemade pickle. My mom used to make khichdi, but it's not the typical runny one that's common in Indian households; it's cooked for a longer period of time and has this soft, deeply-cooked consistency. We like to keep it very simple and only add cumin, salt and turmeric. As a head chef, what are you like? Are you a disciplinarian? Do you shout a lot? Or are you more laid back? I'm not one particular category when it comes to work. When I bring someone into my team, I tell them very clearly what is expected, what is allowed and what is forbidden. So every team member knows all that. I've set the ground rules and I also make it very clear that communication is really, really important. So, they should not hide anything and they should be open about everything. Chef Gaurav's murgh malai tikka the second marinade: 40g full fat labneh; 40ml full chaat masala; 10g ghee INSTRUCTIONS: 1.

Diriyah Biennale Foundation organizes workshops on culture, politics of food - Begum and Rahman are due to bring their open-air kitchen to the Saudi capital, where they will share their recipes and interact with people from different nationalities Riyadh: The Diriyah Biennale Foundation recently organized a workshop in Riyadh on the culture and politics of food as part of the Biennale Encounters year-long event series. Artists Tayeba Begum and Mahbubur Rahman from the Britto Arts Trust in Dhaka, Bangladesh, gave a talk at the foundation auditorium. The pair are running an artistic cooking project called Pakghor, the social kitchen. Last year, they set up an open-air kitchen at the Documenta fifteen, a contemporary art exhibition held in Kassel, Germany. They had a Bengali domestic vegetable garden and cooked foods from 100 recipes representing 100 nations during the 100 days of Documenta fifteen. During the workshop in Riyadh, Begum and Rahman shared stories and recipes from their social kitchen. And they are due to bring their open-air kitchen to the Saudi capital, where they will share their recipes and interact with people from different nationalities. Rahman said: \"The most important part is interaction. The interaction of the family or the neighborhood. \"So, with this project, our target is to bring people together into a place to share their knowledge and their happiness.\" Rahman noted that replicating the same concept in another place, especially Riyadh, would be challenging due to the geographical and cultural differences. \"Saudi Arabia is a very dry country. And that is the challenge. But we hope we can do it because we are collaborating with a local farmer in Riyadh. We had a conversation with him, and he gave us a very good direction,\" Rahman added. The second workshop of the Biennale Encounters series, Njokobok, is slated to be held on Sept. 9 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., at the Diriyah Biennale Foundation auditorium. The foundation has invited residents and members of different communities in Diriyah and Riyadh to cook one dish for the session. Tunisia's bad economy hits coeliac sufferers with rice shortage - The government has denied that shortages are due to the crisis in public finances, with talks for a foreign bailout stalled and credit ratings agencies warning that Tunisia may default on sovereign debt TUNIS: For Siwar Derbeli a national rice shortage is not just another inconvenient symptom of Tunisia's stretched national finances but a source of hunger because the coeliac disease she suffers from means it is one of the few staples she can comfortably eat. Shortages of imported goods sold at subsidised rates have been increasing in Tunisia since last year, with wheat, sugar, cooking oil and dairy products periodically disappearing from supermarket shelves along with some medicines. Although rice is not the most common staple in Tunisia, where bread, pasta and couscous are more frequently eaten, its lack of gluten makes it indispensable for the country's estimated 100,000 people with coeliac disease \u2014 an autoimmune condition that prompts a dangerous response to gluten. \"You come home and can't find the basic food you need to eat. It's a very unfortunate situation,\" said Derbeli, 18. Her mother, Hasna Arfaoui, was cooking Derbeli's evening meal with expensive gluten-free pasta that is hard to afford for Arfaoui, an unemployed widow with three children who used to work as a cleaner. \"We have been facing difficulties with her diet, and it has been very tiring for us. The specialized food she needs is expensive and we often struggle to afford it. Basic ingredients like rice are missing,\" she said. The government has denied that shortages are due to the crisis in public finances, with talks for a foreign bailout stalled and credit ratings agencies warning that Tunisia may default on sovereign debt. However, economists, political analysts and Tunisia's influential labor union have all said the government is delaying or stopping imports of subsidised goods to help cope with a $5 billion budget deficit despite public hardship. Monji ben Hriz, president of the Tunisian Association for Coeliac Disease, said no ship was due to offload rice until December and that state-held stocks had already run out. Some privately imported rice is available, but at a much higher cost that is prohibitive for many Tunisians. \"People are now enduring real difficulties sourcing rice and there are those who have changed their diet for this reason, jeopardizing their health,\" he said. Saudi doctor develops herbal feminine hygiene products - Al-Badr said switching from being a doctor to an entrepreneur posed challenges, including a lack of business knowledge and finding a laboratory to develop and produce the formula JEDDAH: Gynecologist Dr. Ahmed Al-Badr says he is revolutionizing women's health in the Kingdom with his Saudi Food and Drug Authority-approved line of feminine products called Bylsan. Driven by Al-Badr's dedication to enhancing women's health and meeting their unique needs, he says these offer innovative herbal solutions that could transform the industry. The former King Fahad Medical City researcher and executive director for research, who is also an expert in urogynecology (also known as female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery), Al-Badr has a passion for herbal medications. He created Bylsan after noticing the need for properly formulated and hygienic herbal products for women. FASTFACT The founder of Byslan is a former King Fahd Medical City researcher and executive director for research and an expert in urogynecology. \"While working as a researcher, I saw the potential of herbal medications for women's health, but they were not available in the market,\" Al-Badr said. \"After retiring, I finally had the opportunity to create products that could make a difference in women's lives.\" Al-Badr said switching from being a doctor to an entrepreneur posed challenges, including a lack of business knowledge and finding a laboratory to develop and produce the formula. \"I had to find a lab, work on samples, make content changes and handle registrations,\" he added. \"It was a steep learning curve, but I was determined to bring my vision to life.\" Despite being diagnosed with cancer, his passion for creating his products remained unwavering. Although he had to slow down during his treatment, he continued to develop them. Al-Badr used social media extensively to spread the word about Bylsan, providing videos and engaging with his followers on women's health issues. \"When introducing Bylsan, I emphasized its purpose and potential benefits beyond commercial gain,\" he said. \"Building trust and credibility was crucial in showing people the true usefulness and purpose behind what I'm doing.\" The first Bylsan product is a vaginal wash with myrrh and lavender extracts. Al-Badr said it improves healing, provides post-surgery or delivery pain relief, and reduces infection risk. He is developing four other women's health products. \"This is just the beginning,\" Al-Badr said. \"I have 15 products ready for manufacturing, but financial limitations are currently hindering production. However, I'm committed to expanding the Bylsan range for comprehensive women's health solutions.\" Dr. Samir Ghazi Hamada, a consultant obstetrician and gynecologist at the National Guard Hospital in Dammam, hailed the benefits of the Bylsan wash. He said it is especially beneficial for women experiencing fungal infections, odorous discharge or recurrent infections. Dr. Ghadeer Al-Shaikh, a professor and consultant in urogynecology, said the Bylsan wash could be used as an antiseptic agent after gynecological surgery. She added that Bylsan reduces the risk of infection by killing or inhibiting the growth of microorganisms in the intimate area. \"Patients have reported fewer symptoms of discharge and irritation postoperatively, expressing high satisfaction with the product,\" Al-Shaikh said. Customers have also praised the products. Alia from Riyadh said: \"I have used it for two months and the results are great. For the first time, I used a wash that suits me and does not cause me allergies.\" Tagreed from Jeddah described Bylsan as a safe wash that helped her overcome inflammation. Print Edition "}
