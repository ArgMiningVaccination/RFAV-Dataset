There, gripping his apparently real magic wand, was Sooty. After some minor disappointment over his limited powers\u2014not only couldn't he make my brother disappear, but to make even a coin van - ish, he would have to palm it\u2014Sooty began charming my mother and father with his silent antics, and I was happy. If only my friend Stephen could see. In our vigilant age, it's hard to envision a parent letting a small child cross the street alone, dressed only in pajamas and a plaid flannel dressing gown, at six-thirty or seven on a chill Christmas morning. bu t my parents did. Stephen mcmu rray's was the gray stone house opposite ours. It was set well back from the road, approached by a long gravel driveway, at the foot of which stood a pair of stone gateposts. Sooty and I hid behind one of the gateposts (the left one, because I am right-handed) and prepared to put on a puppet show for Stephen's family. mr . mcmu rray would be the first to notice. He would be having his coffee as Steven opened presents. When he glanced out the window and down the hundred-foot drive - way, he would glimpse a tiny yellow bear peeking out from behind a pillar, waving a magic wand. \"Good heavens!\" he would say. \"Stephen, see who's come to visit!\" Stephen would put down whatever new toy he was playing with, and the mcmu rrays would gather at the window, staring open-mouthed as Sooty, come miraculously to life, bobbed and darted and then revealed himself to be me. With the first tentative flip of his wand, Sooty and I felt shivers of anticipation. I peered around the post. The house was quiet. A minute later Sooty sprang up like a jack-in-the-box, and I reconnoitered again. Still nothing. He grew more insistent, bouncing up and down the post, his wand flapping frantically. Could there ever , I thought, have been a family more oblivious than the mcmu rrays? The bear and I trudged home. In the movie version, the camera zooms out and the ground recedes until you see the curvature of the earth and then the earth shrinks to a point before disappearing in a whoosh of stars. It was a hard lesson, but a valuable one. I've often felt there is a Sootiness about many human endeavors: our certainty that we will be seen, heard, read, noticed, or discovered, when in fact we have mistimed our efforts, misread our audience, and overestimated our reach. No amount of oofle dust can fix that.

What the public is dubious about is the practicality of stopping said practice and whether it would make a difference, were it even possible. Regarding fluoridated water and vaccines, individuals are perfectly free to receive both for themselves and their fami - lies. an d regarding evolu - tion, you have much more to fear from your neighbors if, through public indoctrina - tion, you convince them that they are soulless omnivores in an amoral world than you would if they spent their lives seeking to conform to the te n com mandments. st ick to data, ye scientist.

But when i c hecked the si erra cl ub's website, i found that its position is backed up by a 2006 report by the na tional Research co uncil. With science denialism, it's simply not true that we lefties are the problem.

Granted, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and it is increasing in the atmosphere. st ill, a thor- ough reading of the leaked \"climategate\" emails should give pause to anyone who respects science. i n addition, predictions based on climate computer models have been consistently wrong. ou r models will no doubt improve, but climate is an incredibly complex system, and we must remind our - selves that computer models should not be mistaken for reality. tE RRY FR a nKl in, a7 5 aMh ERst, Ma ssach UsEt ts A PROFESSOR TO CHERISH it w as with great sadness that i read of the death of Professor George Marcopoulos in the \" in M emoriam\" section ( su mmer 2012).

He likens nurturing a young player to planting a seed, watering it, and clearing away the weeds. \"And then when it grows,\" he says, \"you sell it.\" That is how the business of baseball works on this island nation, where an estimated 100,000 young men train full time for the chance to become profes - sional ball players in the United States. Trevor Martin, A08, who co-directed the film, spent a year there documenting the lives of two young prospects. He says the system helps explain why twenty percent of professional players in the United States are Dominican. \"It's like a classical co - lonialism approach,\" says Martin, who majored in international relations at Tufts. \"It's like these kids are raw materi - als to be exported en masse, refined in the Major League system, and then sold to the American public.\" All the players dream of making it planet tufts people, projects, passions 6 tufts magazine fall 2012Foul Ball The price Dominicans pay a for a shot at the majors by ju lie Flaherty IDavid or tiz, the re d so x' \"bi g pa pi,\" signed with the se attle Mariners at age sixteen. photo: jim rogash, getty imagesbig; most never will. The same could be said of kids in most American inner cit - ies. Yet the Dominican players typically come from the poorest neighborhoods, and often drop out of school at twelve or thirteen and leave their families to train at the baseball camps. \"They dangle this big payday, which encourages them to treat it as a real career option,\" Martin says. Martin was recruited to Pelotero by two other young directors, Jon Paley from Washington University in St. Louis and Ross Finkel from the University of Colorado, who wanted to make a movie about what makes Dominican players so good. They liked that Martin already had experience in Latin America from his two student films\u2014financed in part by Tufts' Institute for Global Leadership\u2014which dealt with the growing violence against human rights defenders in Bogota and alli - ances between right-wing drug-trafficking paramilitary death squads and Colombian politicians. Plus, they needed someone who spoke Spanish. Martin, in turn, re - cruited Casey Beck, A07, who would be instrumental in filming and interviewing. They landed on the island in 2009. \"We looked ridiculous,\" Martin admits: four white college kids in a beat-up 'ninety-four Camry, with their broken Spanish and their camera equipment, trying to maneu - ver their way through the training camps and the slums where many of the players' families live. He says the clown factor may actually have helped them at first. And then the players got used to having them around. \"We didn't leave,\" he says. \"We just kept coming back every day.\" Soon after shooting started, Martin knew the film would not just be about chil - dren swinging broomsticks at rolled-up socks in the dusty streets. The Dominican recruitment business is its own game, with its own peculiar rules, one of which has to do with age. Major League Baseball puts a hefty premium on players who are sixteen, the youngest age they can sign a contract. MLB reasons that it needs to sign Dominican players younger, to allow time for training them and teaching them English. \"It provides a rationale behind devaluing older players in the market,\" Martin says. Teams may offer millions to a handful of sixteen-year-olds, while hun - dreds of players who are older, so-called old men\" may settle for tens of thousands. Families will alter birth records, or buy the identity of a younger neighbor, just to shave a year off their son's age. In the film, we meet the tall and powerful Miguel Sano, the top prospect in the 2009 season, who is kept in limbo as MLB in - vestigators put him through a battery of DNA tests and bone scans to verify his age and identity. One of Sano's relatives accuses the Pittsburgh Pirates' scout, who has been courting Sano, of creating sus - picion to keep other teams from making an offer. Each day the investigation drags on, the player's market value drops, until, Sano says, an MLB investigator offers to stop the investigation if Sano admits he is nineteen and signs with the Pirates. Alan Klein, a professor of sociology-an - thropology at Northeastern University and the author of several books about baseball in the Dominican Republic, including the upcoming Dominican Baseball: New Pride, Old Prejudice , says other filmmakers have tried to document the system. \"What distinguishes these filmmakers was they actually spent time on the ground. You could tell, because they were able to get deeper into the system.\" Deep enough to have a camera rolling when Sano's fam-ily appeals for help from the Dominican f all 2012 tufts magazine 7 aD Va nce Gu arD .

After a year of desperate pitches to investors, a friend introduced them to the former professional ballplayer Bobby Valentine (he would become manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2011). Valentine had formed a small media company to produce sports documentaries. He liked what he saw, and signed on as producer. The film has been a rock in the cleat of MLB. A spokesman said that the film, shot in 2009, has \"inaccura - cies and misrepresentations that don't reflect the current status of operations in the Dominican Republic.\" Klein says MLB has tried to address prob - lems\u2014such as alleged skimming of signing bonuses by scouts\u2014that have been pointed out to them. But he adds: \"These filmmakers got it right, and the fact of the matter is that those kinds of things happen and will continue to happen as long as the Dominican Republic is a third-world country.\" Martin concedes that baseball adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the country's economy. \"That's what makes it such a complex issue,\" he says. \"You can't just look at Major League Baseball and condemn them outright.\" For his part, he still loves the game, which he played in high school. And he still plans to go to Major League games.

Seven expert-level puzzles later, it placed one hundred forty-first. Dr. Fill's less than stellar per - formance highlights the complexity of the processes that go on in a human brain as it is solving a crossword. For someone like Raymond Nickerson, G65, who is both an avid crossword puzzle solver and a research professor of psychology at Tufts, those processes provide a glimpse into how the mind works. Nickerson examined the subject in an essay published last year in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin and Review . \"It oc - curred to he says, \"that crosswords intersect with a great number of things that I'm interested in, particularly reason - ing and memory.\" For example, he says, \"in problem solving, we tend to assume that we have found the solution, and once we do, that it's the only solution to be Clued In to the Brain What crosswords tell us about reasoning and memory by he lene raGoVi n Wfound. Typically, we don't think further about the problem and discover that there may be other solutions.\" The same happens in puzzle solving. If we're looking for a noun, we don't think to look for a verb. And if we find a noun that fits, we don't explore other possibili - ties. \"That's somewhat characteristic of the way we solve problems in general,\" Nickerson says. As much as science has uncovered about the mind, mysteries abound. Little is known, for example, about how we search our memories. In a crossword puzzle, there are a variety of clues for each word: definitions (some more subtle or tricky than others), the length of the word, and perhaps some letters filled in by intersecting clues. Seasoned solv - ers also look for hints contained within the clues\u2014question marks or abbrevia - tions\u2014and they know that a clue and its answer are usually expressed in the same part of speech. And yet, Nickerson says, we have no idea how each brain goes about the process of combing its database of knowledge to find an answer. Quick, think of a four-letter word ending in bt . Most people can produce the word debt almost instantly. \"How did you do that search?\" Nickerson asks. We can look for words by meaning, by partial length, by observing letters in certain positions, by visual cues, by auditory cues, or by some combination of those. But, he says, \"it seems unlikely that a search of my entire lexicon, or anything close to that, is required.\" For that matter, do we even search for words at all? It might be easier to search our memory on the basis of letters, syl - lables, phonemes (units of sound that distinguish one word from another) or morphemes (meaningful linguistic units of a word). Sometimes the answer is stuck on the tip of your tongue. Often, Nickerson writes in his journal essay, \"I am not immediately able to call the target to mind, but I have a strong sense that I will be able to do so with the help of additional clues or, per - haps, just with the passage of time.

Years from now, when he looks back on Budapest to Bamako 2012, Byrne will remember the floods, he says\u2014his team had to ford rivers, using a snorkel tube to make sure their motor didn't drown. And he'll never forget what it was like to forage for food. \"In the first world, we have un - limited choices,\" he notes, \"but in Africa there were virtually no supermarkets. We had to go from shop to shop and didn't even understand what was being sold. The labels were in Arabic. Surviving on figs and nuts got old pretty fast.\" Then there was the recurring need to offer bribes, or \" petits cadeaux ,\" to guards at border crossings. Flashlights, tea, ban-dages, and team hats usually did the trick, and \"anything with 'Obama' was superb,\" he says. Even the occasional flat tire pre - sented memorable challenges to the for - mer mechanic: in the western Sahara, Byrne had to jack up a vehicle that was buried in sand up to its axles. That didn't stop the team from finishing in the top twenty-five. Byrne sums it up this way: \"It was amazing. It was grueling.\" But if the hard-ships of the journey were out of the ordi - nary, the connections Byrne made with people were more exceptional still: \"The woman who runs the orphanage. A kid I have come to consider almost as a son. The man who made us a fabulous meal and said, 'Welcome to Morocco.'

Both involve using a needle to remove cells from either the placenta or amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus. By analyzing genetic material from those cells, you can tell for sure whether the fetus has a disorder like Down syndrome. un fortunately, these procedures come with a risk of miscarriage, so for many years, my lab has been interested in noninvasive ways to get the same genetic information. on e thing we've worked on is using free- floating DN a\u2014 from the placenta\u2014that is released into the mother's blood. We have helped to develop a simple blood test to ex - tract that DN a without causing any harm to the fetus. Within the past year, this test has already been incorporated into clinical care. it 's incredibly useful, but it still doesn't solve the problem of what to do after diag - nosis. fo r me and my laboratory group, the challenge is how to treat genetic conditions while the fetus is in the womb.ri ght now, we're working with mice that have a genetic equivalent of human Down syndrome, and we're using them to identify drugs that can help improve learning and memory in their newborns. We're years away from clinical trials, but i think it could eventually make a big difference for the lives of children with genetic disorders. in a w ay, the work we do is sort of the final fron - tier. in m edicine, we put a lot of emphasis on the end of life, but we don't have nearly as many resources to prevent problems at the very beginning of life. \" \u2014Diana bia nchi, executive director, mo ther-inf ant re search in stitute, tu fts me dical ce nter st opping ly me Disease at the s ource th ere's no magic bullet against Lyme disease, but we may be able to target its source. th e bacterium that causes the disease, Borrelia burgdorferi , is carried by small animals like mice. as t iny larval ticks feed on the mice, they pick up the infection, which they spread to other animals when they feed again later in life. ri ght now, there's no human vaccine, but there is one that works on mice. if w e can vaccinate them against Lyme, we may be able to reduce the number of infected ticks. pr ofessor Linden hu a t tu fts me dical ce nter and i are testing this idea right now, using special bait containing the vaccine. as mice eat the bait, they become immunized to Lyme, so they won't infect ticks.

They were young and ambitious and wanted to have an impact on the world. So they decided to tackle the biggest technological challenge they could hope to solve in their lifetime: natural-language speech recognition. They pioneered a radical new approach and started Dragon Systems in 1982 to commercialize it. The company took off. People everywhere started using Dragon products for dictation or for communicating with devices. But before the Bakers could reap the full profit of their technology (which today is said to power the iPhone's Siri), they entered into a business deal so disastrous it left them sPeechless.ja net Mac iv er Baker, cofounder of dr agon sy stems, speech recognition pioneer18 tufts magazine fall 2012Worse yet, they lost control of the pat - ents to their own ideas, and were now sud - denly barred from developing the technol- ogy they'd pioneered. Baker has a word for that, too: \"Devastating,\" she says. Sitting at her dining table in an ornate Victorian home in the Boston suburb of Newton, Baker clearly didn't lose everything with the dissolution of her company. But even after more than a decade\u2014and continuing lawsuits against those they deem respon - sible\u2014she can't talk about the debacle without emotion. She plucks artifacts of Dragon Systems from a large plastic bin filled with magazine clippings, articles from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal , and other mementos. Both of the Bakers have since landed on their feet. Jim is a Distinguished Career Professor at Carnegie Mellon, and helped found the Defense Department-funded Human Language Technology Center at Johns Hopkins University. Janet is a visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab and a lecturer at Harvard Medical School, where she is researching how the brain understands language. And although their company disap - peared, the technology that Baker helped invent lives on. In February 2010, the com-pany that acquired Dragon's patents and software, Nuance Communications, col - laborated with Siri Inc., a spinoff of SRI International (formerly Stanford Research Institute), to unveil a new smartphone app, an intelligent assistant called Siri. Two months later, Apple acquired Siri Inc. for an undisclosed sum and made the app the most hyped aspect of its iPhone 4S, released last fall (Siri is also a big part of the new iPhone 5). Nuance itself produces a suite of dictation programs based on Dragon NaturallySpeaking, licenses Dragon-brand software to control everything from car navigation systems to coffee makers to TVs, and just announced its own competitor to Siri called Nina. None of this would be pos - sible if it weren't for a promise that Baker and her husband made to each other more than forty years ago. Now in her sixties, Janet Baker flashes a warm smile as she lays out muffins and coffee on a sun-splashed dining table. Her long gray hair is tied back in a no-non - sense ponytail, and she wears dangly ear - rings, gold-rimmed glasses, and a vaguely Asian-looking purple blouse. Dragons are all around the house\u2014with statuettes lin - ing the mantle in the living room and a two-hundred-pound sculpture guarding the front hall. \"In the Chinese world the dragon is the spirit of creativity, but every culture has some powerful, untamed force,\" she says. \"We thought that speech and language was also a very powerful force.\" The Bakers first vowed to tame that force soon after they married, during Columbus Day weekend of 1971. The two were doctoral students at Rockefeller University, in New York City, later trans - ferring to Carnegie Mellon University\u2014he a mathematician and she a biophysi - cist. Young and ambitious, they sought an area in which they could pool their expertise to make a significant impact on the world. \"We wanted to do some - thing that would be practical and useful and more than a paper on a library shelf,\" Baker says. \"And we decided the goal had to be satisfied in our lifetime.\" Making some rough estimates of the computing power necessary to solve the problem (and taking into account Moore's law, which predicts that microchips dou - ble in power about every two years), they settled on speech recognition as a worth - while and attainable goal for their life's work. \"Our long-term goal was always to achieve a system to transcribe what you are saying in close to real time, with a practi - cal degree of accuracy and a high degree of performance,\" Baker says. \"We figured it would take us twenty-five to forty years to get there.\" At the time they made that choice, speech recognition was already a staple of science fiction adventures like Star Trek , Star Wars , and 2001: A Space Odyssey , where robots and computers effortlessly responded to human speech\u2014for good or for bad (\"Just what do you think you are doing, Dave?\"). In reality, however, the problem was not so easy to solve. Computers might be good at arithmetic, but they have only a fraction of the com-putational power of the human brain. So while humans can easily recognize the same word spoken in different tones and accents, computers exhibit a notorious tin ear for language. \"There is huge variability in the way we speak,\" explains Baker. \"I can say the same word, word, wooord, wooooord?\"\u2014she alters the intonation half a dozen times\u2014\"and I can drastically change the way it sounds. You recognize it as 'word' every time, even when there is a jackhammer or a lawnmower in the background. That's not easy.\" Studies show that we humans often recognize words even when we don't hear large parts of them\u2014our brains fill in the gaps automatically. How we do it, though, is an almost total mystery, depen - dent on a complex interplay of sensory and cognitive brain functions. But Baker had been trained in look - ing at problems from multiple direc - tions at once. Growing up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she had already decided by the age of five that she was going to be a doctor. She remembers coming across a hulking edition of Gray's Anatomy in her hallway bookshelf. Taught to read at an early age, she pulled it out and read the foreword and was immediately dis - couraged. \"The message was that you can't understand any system of the body without understanding all of the other systems, because they are all intercon - nected,\" she says. \"I didn't see how anyone could break into that loop.\" The lesson stuck with her, however, as her interests took her from clinical medicine to medi - cal research by high school. A friend was the son of a well-known neuroscientist at MIT, Jerome Lettvin, who let her sit in on janet maciver baker, j69, simply calls it \"the debacle.\" it's as good a word as any to describe the cascade of events that led to the sud - den demise of Dragon Systems, the company she and her husband Jim had grown for decades, then lost virtually overnight. Living up to its namesake's reputation for power and creativity, Dragon cracked one of the most intractable problems in computing\u2014speech recognition technology. Then, just as their successful business had merged with a larger company and was poised to grow worldwide, the Bakers watched as the company went bust, taking all of their technology, employees, and money with it. f all 2012 tufts magazine 19classes and even gave her lab space for her own experiments\u2014a heady experience for a fifteen-year-old. When it came time for her to pick a college, she chose Tufts, thanks in large part to a new Experimental College pro - gram, an intensive math and science cur - riculum funded by the National Science Foundation. The idea was for students to approach a problem\u2014say, snake loco - motion\u2014simultaneously from different disciplines, including math, chemis - try, physics, and biology. Baker's roving mind ate it up. \"I've always been inter - ested in looking to see what one area of science can give to another,\" she says. She applied that multidisciplinary approach as she began focusing on how animals process information, studying the neu - rophysiology of moth ears at Tufts, the visual receptors of horseshoe crabs at Rockefeller University, and the acoustics of speech processing at Carnegie Mellon. Now turning her attention to the prob - lem of speech recognition, it was almost like opening up Gray's Anatomy all over again. When humans take in speech, they process an incredible amount of informa - tion\u2014not only the unique characteristics of a person's voice, but also the language being spoken, the topic of conversation, the speaker's emotional state, and the background noise. Like the systems of the body, it's hard to make sense of any one of those without understanding the others. At the time the Bakers began their quest, however, most researchers in speech rec - ognition approached the task as a rule-based process, combining one or more of those sources of information and applying certain rules to determine the word that had been spoken. Jim pioneered a method to combine all of these knowledge sources into a common mathematical model. He col - lected statistics on the different sources of information, using probabilities to predict the words being spoken. As more speech becomes available, the system learns to make better predictions. \"That was radical at the time, and even considered heretical by some,\" says Janet Baker. \"People were saying you can't model this, you can't model that, but it turns out you can model almost anything in this framework.\" The approach quickly proved workable, though the computer industry did not adopt it for more than a decade. After completing their doctorates at Carnegie Mellon, the couple worked on speech recognition at IBM and Verbex (a division of Exxon Enterprises). But after a few years, they grew frustrated with the slow pace of development of the technol-ogy for commercial use. They decided to go it alone, opting to form a startup dedicated to advancing state-of-the-art speech recognition in practical, afford - able products and applications. With just $35,000 of personal savings\u2014and a big mortgage and two preschoolers to tend to\u2014they founded Dragon Systems in May 1982. They were a close-knit team, sharing the work on both technical and business fronts. They couldn't afford large mainframes or other custom hardware. Instead, they worked on small personal computers such as the Apple IIe, streamlining and adapt - ing mathematical equations that were typ - ically run on machines with much greater computing power. By 1984 they had cre - ated a prototype of a dictation system that could transcribe words\u2014Providing. The. Speaker. Paused. Between. Each. One. At first, it took twenty-two seconds for the computer to understand a single word. Over the next six years, however, as computing power increased and they made further advances, the response time shrunk to a fraction of a second. The company released the world's first general-purpose dictation system, DragonDictate-30K, in March 1990. While the program was well received by the technical community and the press, it didn't break through with general con - sumers, who balked at the idea of pausing between words. Despite that drawback, there were major beneficiaries. People who couldn't type, especially disabled people, suddenly found that they could get jobs, go to school, produce email and reports, and otherwise benefit from computers, all because of the Dragon software. Despite the modest success of Dragon - Dictate, the Bakers still hadn't achieved the goal they set for themselves in 1971: Mementos of dr agon sy stems, including photos of the Bakers demonstrating speech recognition, fill a tub in the couple's home.20 tufts magazine fall 2012to create a system that could transcribe continuous speech. This proved a tough nut to crack. To recognize words without pauses, the computer had to be able to identify the beginning and end of words anywhere in the vocal stream\u2014the dif - ference, say, between I love you and all of you or isle view . \"That doesn't sound like a big change,\" says Baker, \"but it turns out it takes from a hundred to a thousand times as much computational power.\" After a few years, they developed a prototype. Already, however, they were conscious of other companies\u2014heavy-hitters like IBM and Microsoft\u2014working on their own speech recognition programs. Now within sight of their goal, the Bakers sought an infusion of cash to pull them over the finish line first. Up to that point, the company had been completely self-funded and debt free, growing entirely through revenues from products, soft - ware licenses, and some U.S. govern - ment research contracts. But competition changed the game. In 1994, Dragon accepted $20 mil - lion from the disk drive maker Seagate Technology for a twenty-five percent stake in the company. The money went to translating research code into marketable form, as well as hiring a phalanx of sales and marketing staff to launch the prod - uct with a splash within three years. (An additional investment boosted Seagate's stake to about thirty-five percent.) The result was Dragon NaturallySpeaking, the first general-purpose continuous dictation system. All users had to do was train the program to the sound of their voice, and they could dictate notes and letters into word processing files, as well as control their computer with simple voice commands. On April 2, 1997, the product was released into the world. Dragon NaturallySpeaking was an instant success. It swept the awards for the software industry, won acco - lades from both the technology and the business community, and made the \"edi - tors' choice\" and \"best of\" lists in the major computer magazines. Doctors, lawyers, and average computer users could now just talk to create text and data. Now, twenty-six years after the Bakers had first predicted success within twenty-five to forty years, they had reached their goal. As with many accomplishments, how - ever, the Bakers realized that this was only the beginning of a new journey. Mainstream newspapers such as USA Today and the New York Times , while enthusiastic about the prospects of the new technology, noted that it was not without its kinks\u2014requiring substantial time to train the computer properly and still mak - ing mistakes. \"We had achieved our initial goal, but we didn't think we had achieved our pinnacle,\" acknowledges Baker. Now that they had cracked the nut of how to transcribe speech, the Bakers redoubled their efforts to make the product better. In addition to improving the accuracy rate of the software, they set out to exploit new applications. In short order, the company grew to four hundred employees, with six different lines of research, including mul - tilingual dictation and transcription; tele - phone systems; embedded technologies for cell phones, mobile devices, and auto navi - gation; voice-enabled Internet, which was just then becoming widespread; and audio mining for searching recorded speech for specific words, topics, and speakers. Such an ambitious program would require more cash. With revenues of nearly $70 million, Dragon Systems had a head start on all of these technologies, but the Bakers feared they wouldn't keep it for long with the big boys on their heels. Other companies had periodically offered to buy Dragon Systems\u2014now the Bakers seriously considered two such overtures, one from Visteon, an $18 billion division of Ford Motor Company, and the other from Lernout & Hauspie, a $10 billion Belgian speech software company.Then came \"the debacle.\"In addition to hiring top lawyers and accountants, the Bakers paid $5 million to the Wall Street firm of Goldman Sachs to perform due diligence. Before consider - ing the offers, they wanted to make sure the companies were on sound financial footing and would come through on what they promised. Looking back on the deci - sion now, Baker still insists they did the right thing. \"We spent millions of dollars trying to do it the best way possible with the best partners we could find,\" she says. \"We always had a policy of trying to find the best possible people to do what could be done, but\u2014\" she continues, her voice lowering, \"we lost big time.\" After merger arrangements with Visteon fell through, the Bakers decided to go with L&H, signing a deal for $580 million. Initially, the deal was supposed to be half in cash and half in stock. But just before signing, L&H spent a sub - stantial amount to acquire another com - pany, Dictaphone. The company asked the Bakers for an all-stock deal instead, and they agreed. The deal went through in June 2000. The champagne had hardly been drunk, however, before a Wall Street Journal reporter released a series of scath - ing articles, starting in August, suggesting that L&H had cooked its books\u2014that it had created fictitious orders to customers in Asia and blatantly fabricated revenues. By the end of November, L&H had gone bankrupt, taking the Bakers' company, and most of their money, with it. A dozen years later, Baker still seems incredulous about the sudden reversal of fortune. \"We kept on trying to get it back,\" she says. \"We tried to raise money to buy back a piece of it, and kept trying and trying until it became clear we were not going to get any of it back.\" In the fire sale that followed the bankruptcy, a company called ScanSoft bought most of L&H's assets\u2014including the invaluable Dragon computer code\u2014on the cheap. a dozen years later, Baker still seems incredulous about the sudden reversal of fortune. \"We kept on trying to get it back,\" she says. \"We tried to raise money to buy back a piece of it.\" f all 2012 tufts magazine 21Engaging in a speech company shopping spree, ScanSoft acquired Nuance in 2005, and took its name to become Nuance Communications. It wasn't until 2010 that the executives from L&H were held accountable for their crimes. Nearly a decade after the company collapsed, its founders, Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, were convicted in a Belgian court of accounting fraud and sentenced along with two other executives to three- to five-year terms. Because of overcrowd - ing in the Belgian prisons, though, their sentences were all commuted and they served little actual time. The Bakers have filed suit against Goldman Sachs in U.S. District Court in Boston for a bil - lion dollars in damages, alleging that the company failed to vet L&H's finances\u2014a case that could go to trial as early as this fall. Under advice from her lawyers, Baker won't talk about the lawsuit, but a long feature story in the New York Times this summer detailed a string of mis - steps by Goldman, in which the company entrusted the deal to four unsupervised junior executives, who failed to ade - quately check L&H's customers. For its part, Goldman Sachs has argued in court papers that checking L&H's finan - cials was not Goldman's responsibility, but was properly the role of its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. Besides, Goldman has argued, since the deal was made by the board of Dragon Systems\u2014a business that no longer exists\u2014the Bakers have no right to sue them. The financial services com - pany has further demanded the Bakers pay all its legal fees. The case is scheduled to go to trial in November. Meanwhile, the Bakers have been left to pick up the pieces, watching helplessly while Nuance's stock value has skyrock - eted in recent years, now exceeding $7 billion. (The company made an estimated $60 to $120 million on the Apple deal alone). \"We lost big time,\" Baker repeats quietly. \"But life goes on.\" This year in Kyoto, Jim and Janet Baker were honored \"for fundamental contributions to the the - ory and practice of automatic speech rec - ognition\" with what amounts to a lifetime achievement award by the international engineering trade association IEEE, which declared in an award ceremony that the pair has \"reshaped the field of automatic speech recognition.\" Apple won't talk about how much Dragon's software undergirds the infra-structure of Siri, and Baker won't talk about Siri, either. It's public knowledge, though, that during the development of the software, Nuance contributed the por - tion that transcribes a user's speech\u2014both for transcribing voice to text messages, notes, and emails, and for asking Siri ques - tions like \"Where can I find a hamburger joint?\" It was Siri Inc. that developed the app's natural-language-understanding \"back end,\" the part that figures out appropriate responses to those questions. So Baker probably escapes blame from Siri's critics, who fault the virtual assis - tant for her sometimes frustrating and less than helpful responses. Baker is bullish about the current boom in speech recognition applications, even if she isn't at the heart of its proliferation. She compares it to the excitement over networks a decade ago, when connecting computers was a complicated feat. \"Now people don't think of networks, because they are integrated into everything we are doing,\" she says. She envisions a world, not too far in the future, where speech tech - nology is considered equally mundane. \"Speech recognition will be most suc - cessful when it's invisible, just incorpo - rated into things as another way of inter - acting,\" she says, \"and you don't have to jump through hoops or go through a lot of preparation to do it.\" Besides lecturing on entrepreneurship at business schools and consulting on speech technology at the MIT Media Lab, Baker has returned to her roots in biol - ogy. As a researcher at Harvard Medical School, she studies the most complex computer there is: the human brain. Even as Siri and other programs have begun to mimic the brain's potential, the way humans understand language is still a black box to neuroscience. Using tools like magnetoencephalography that didn't exist decades ago, Baker has gone back to square one, trying to understand how the brain distinguishes between different words and concepts. \"We started speech recognition with only ten or twenty words,\" says Baker, referring to the early days of Dragon, when calculating how to transcribe even that many words was an accomplishment. Now, with the brain, she says, \"we are back to ten-word recognition. We can do pretty well figuring out when and where it's hap - pening, but exactly how it's doing it is still a mystery.\" If the dragon is the symbol of power and creativity, then the brain might be the most formidable beast of all.

Lately, they have been a mainstay of the PBS series Downton Abbey , a sudsy cocktail of love and war with the deeper narrative of the British ruling class: the struggle of Lord Grantham and his family to maintain their equilibrium in the face of dramatic shifts in their social landscape. Downton \u2014 like the works of Evelyn Waugh and Jane Austen\u2014offers a glimpse of an ordered world now faded. So, too, do the historic house museums the aristocracy has left behind: great mansions like Uppark, set in immense parklands and home to priceless canvases and objets d'art. In 2011, I spent my summer vacation in Lord Grantham's world. I was one of four dozen fellows of Britain's Attingham Summer School, which, each year since 1952, has filled a coach bus with an inter - national coterie of curators, architects, college professors, archivists, conserva - tors, and other devotees for a private tour of English country estates. The stops are mostly to houses operated as museums, but sometimes they include homes rarely, if ever, open to the hoi polloi. Our group was on the road every morning and afternoon, visiting more than three dozen country houses over the course of three weeks. In the evenings, we listened to lectures on ecclesiastical archi - tecture, Baroque (that is, \"Baa-ROCK\") furniture, and a dozen other specialties, accumulating stores of knowledge about such matters as the tapestries at Hardwick Hall and the famous Holbein portrait of Henry VIII at Belvoir (pronounced \"Beaver\") Castle. The food historian Peter Brears delivered one of the best presenta - tions. This bearded bear of a man\u2014he's a serious cook, with a belly to match\u2014explained the houses' array of food prepa - ration areas, which might consist of more than a dozen discrete spaces, among them a salting room, brush room, bakehouse, brewery, still room, and buttery, in addi-tion to larders, and pastry, vegetable, and main sculleries, and, finally, the kitchen. Such talks left me, even after twelve hours of touring and highbrow discussion, bound for the pub to compare notes with other Attingham Fellows. As I took in the world of the English aristocracy, the hierarchy of the peerage assumed a new significance (in descend - ing order, it's duke to marquis, earl, vis - count, baron, and baronet). I learned that the country house, which depended upon income from the estate, was truly home, even though one might go to London for \"the season.\" That home was linked through a matrix of socioeconomic fac - tors to its surrounding community\u2014vil - lagers, local business, and even factories and extraction industries. More than a few aristocratic families in earlier cen - turies secured their position with the profits from coal dug from their acres. At one estate, Erdigg on the Welsh border, the colliery extended beneath the house itself, which, as a result, began to subside into the earth. By my second week as an Attingham Fellow, I felt empowered to step over the velvet ropes into territory normally for - bidden to visitors. The conservators in the group liked nothing better than to invert a chair and investigate its webbing, glue blocks, and secondary woods. At one house, a Dutch decorative arts curator removed a pair of stools from the foot of the bed in a state bedroom. \"It is wrong,\" he observed dryly, his English as impec - cable as his suit. \"They were never there.\" Watching him carefully reset the pieces, I recognized my good fortune to be in the company of such well-versed fel - low travelers to the past. My colleagues possessed expertise in ceramics, silver, and the Red Books (volumes of \"before\" and \"after\" views) of the landscape designer Humphry Repton. The painting curators talked of attribution, varnishes, and impasto; the architectural historians sought clues to how and why structures had changed over the centuries. From the first day, however, the most vital moments for me concerned the people for whom these extravagant mansions were home. People like Evelyn Forbes James, who a century ago was the lady of the house at West Dean in West Sussex, and was said to be the ille - gitimate daughter of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). One Sunday morning Lady James called up the great winding stair to the nursery. \"Nanny,\" she ordered, \"I need a child to go to church with.\" Wanting to please her mistress, the servant replied, \"Which one, ma'am?\" Evelyn James's answer: \"The one that goes best with my blue dress.\" The baby of the family was Edward. Whether or not his mother's detached approach to nurturance had anything to do with it, Edward became a poet, a patron of the arts, and an eccentric with a consuming passion for the surrealists. Thanks to him, the James estate eventu - ally became West Dean College, where students today learn conservation and restoration, as well as tapestry weaving and other crafts. he lilting voice that floated across his grand garden proved to be nothing less than a siren song for Sir Harry Fetherstonaugh, the seventy-year-old bachelor squire of the fine country house known as Uppark, in West Sussex. In younger days, Fetherstonaugh (1754-1846) had been a boon companion of the profligate Prince of Wales, since enthroned as King George IV. But retired to Uppark, the aging baronet was belatedly to discover domestic bliss in a most unlikely place, namely the farmyard of his estate. Just months after first hearing her sweet voice, he married his twenty-year-old junior dairy maid, the rather plain Mary Ann Bullock. It was, of course, an act of social suicide\u2014Mary Ann, even after a trip to Paris to acquire the social graces, spoke with all the polish of the flower seller Eliza Doolittle.t f all 2012 tufts magazine 25to walk from room to room in some of the grand houses is to view the ancestral past of a given family and to sur - vey the evolution of British painting\u2014in family portraits by Kneller, Van Dyck, Reynolds, West, Gainsborough, Romney, Lawrence, Sargent, and even Lucian Freud. At Chatsworth, a palace that some call \"National Gallery North,\" all of those artists are represented, along with Da Vinci, Raphael, and Rembrandt. And, mind you, this a collection from which the last generation sold a good many of the finest paintings to pay off death duties assessed at eighty percent of the estate's value. Chatsworth is currently occupied by the twelfth Duke of Devonshire, Peregrine Cavendish, and the Duchess, Amanda Carmen Heywood-Lonsdale Cavendish. When our group visited, the couple served lunch in one of the event rooms, where women from the village waited on us. Perhaps because of my sta - tus as an elder amongst the scholars, I was designated to join the duke at table. A one-percenter for the ages (the Cavendish who built Chatsworth was a courtier to Henry VIII), he opened our conversation disarmingly. \"I am embarrassed to say I've not read any of your books,\" he offered, his eyes hooded, his gaze direct. Why would he have? I asked myself, but before I could respond, he added, \"But I think you know something of Mr. Jefferson?\" If he hadn't read any of my prose, he certainly had gone to the trouble of reviewing my bio\u2014which mentions my two books on Thomas Jefferson\u2014and we were soon swapping stories about American presidents. No doubt he has a rooting interest, as his uncle was mar - ried to John F. Kennedy's sister Kathleen before their premature deaths (his in World War II, hers in a car crash in 1948). But soon enough the conversation came around to Chatsworth. His family home is quite evidently the duke's passion, and every detail engages him. The house is now operated by the Chatsworth Trust (the family pays rent for their quarters), but since he suc - ceeded to the dukedom on the death of his father in 2004, there is no doubt who is in charge at the 126-room dwelling. A new master plan he commissioned is in place. Many rooms and objects have been reinstalled. A man in his late sixties with a mobile face that always seems to convey his interest in the topic under discussion, he offered forthright opinions. We talked of an ongoing exterior restoration, and I asked about the regilding of the windows, a touch that would give the palace the look of an immense jewel box. \"Oh, you mean the bling?\" he offered with a sly smile. After a pause, his face suddenly serious, he added, \"It will be wonderful to see the house as my ances - tors saw it.\" When asked about the absence of labels on the pictures, he gave me an immediate answer. \"It's a house ,\" he said firmly but kindly. \" Not a museum.\" Here, I believe, he was conveying more than a simple insistence on the domes - tic. Country houses are big business in the United Kingdom; Chatsworth and its surrounding parkland alone welcome some seven hundred thousand visitors a \"Lady James called up to the nursery, 'Nanny, I need a child to go to church with.' \"26 tufts magazine fall 2012 \"I drifted into Flintham's library and found a number of my colleagues flopped on sofas.\" f all 2012 tufts magazine 27year. And as the duke's words implied, he is keenly aware that while the properties afford countless lessons about England's cultural, economic, military, and royal history, the paying public often comes to see how the aristocracy really lived\u2014and continues to live. Visitors to the estates are inevitably awed by the sheer scale of the archi - tecture. As an Americanist, I under - stood that our greatest early villas were descended from the English country house. But on the Attingham tour, there was no mistaking the vastly larger scale of the English antecedent even in compari - son to a vaunted national monument such as George Washington's Mount Vernon. At Kedleston, a domed masterwork by the architect Robert Adam, my first impres - sion on entering the central hall was that another domed house, Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, could be put on display\u2014in its entirety\u2014within the cavernous vol - ume of that one room. The weeks amounted to a short course on British architecture. Our travels took us to several buildings by Joseph Paxton, whose 1851 glass-and-iron Crystal Palace was a monument to both the Industrial Revolution and England's might, and by John Nash, one of the architects of Buckingham Palace. I was amused to learn that, like our countryman Frank Lloyd Wright, Nash repeatedly designed sophisticated buildings with leaky roofs. The most remarkable architectural features we encountered were not always the work of acknowledged masters. At Welbeck, the intensely shy \"Burrowing Duke\" constructed two-and-a-half miles of underground tunnels, some of them large enough for a horse and carriage. And at Erddig, an immense house on the Welsh border packed with generations of objects, everything is inverted. Visitors arrive\u2014it's been a National Trust site since 1973\u2014as if they were tradesmen or servants. The farm and stable yards are on the approach, as is the slaughterhouse, sawmill, and a dozen other trade build - ings. The kitchen and laundry wing are next, and one enters the house at the ser - vant level, the lower ground floor. There the basement passage amounts to a kind of long gallery, but one featur - ing portraits quite unlike Chatsworth's parade of dukes and duchesses. The paintings in this case are by lim - ners, uneducated itinerant artists who worked before and after the turn of the nineteenth century. These crudely executed pictures are accompanied by photographs taken a hundred or more years later. And every likeness is that of a servant\u2014a carpenter, housemaid, gardener, gamekeeper, housekeeper, or butcher\u2014many of them with the tools of their trade in hand. If Lord Grantham's kindness to his servants at Downton Abbey seems to some ahistorical, the Yorkes at Erddig amount to a notable precedent. And their example debunks the notion that Britain's upstairs-downstairs narratives were always confined to the realm of scandal and romance. Indeed, our group learned that a Victorian-era housekeeper at Uppark, the same estate where Sir Harry Fetherstonaugh succumbed to the charms of his young dairymaid, later gave birth to another low-class individual who improved his social standing in a very different manner. The housekeeper's son grew up to be a writer named H.G. Wells. For the record, our itiner - ary did not include Highclere Castle, home to the Earl and Countess Carnavon, the grand Gothic wedding cake of a house that mil - lions have come to know on PBS. Having toured many similar houses, however, I can now both appreciate the drama of Downton Abbey and recognize that its evocation of the past often depends on the mere sketched-in outline of a single imag - ined moment. We Attingham scholars had one such vignette of our own, though no film crew was at hand. It occurred at Flintham Hall in Nottinghamshire. Like Downton (I mean, Highclere), Flintham is a mansion of mid-nine - teenth-century character that remains in family hands. We had explored the house, visited the garden, and chatted with the owner, a London barrister, and were about to walk to the bus when a sudden hard rain delayed matters. I drifted into Flintham's library, an expansive space with book-lined balco - nies reached by a spiral stone stair, and found a number of my colleagues flopped on sofas, idly writing in their notebooks or reading. As the time passed (the shower proved persistent), others wandered in from elsewhere in the large house, where they had been examining furniture and good pictures. Some took photographs of the scene, and the big room seemed happy to absorb us all. The interlude was accompanied by the sound of water run - ning off the forty-foot-tall vaulted glass roof of the adjacent conservatory. For an instant, the sensation came over me that we were truly inhabiting a country house, not just inspecting it, jot - ting notes about it, or listening to wise people instruct us. This extraordinary group of trained observers\u2014all of whom I had come to like and admire\u2014had become more than tourists. We were, however briefly, accidental guests. I might suggest we were lost in time. One could imagine that the fox hunt - ers would be back from the fields at any moment, drenched but exhilarated. Or that tea was to be served or whiskey and sherry offered round. And that the mon - arch was Edward rather than Elizabeth. None of that was true, of course. But I do think it was why we had come.

Some are quite sick; others are recovering nicely from injury or illness. Some are in a nasty mood. Others raise their heads as the man in khakis, a stethoscope dangling from his neck, draws near. He treats them all the same, with a deft, compassionate touch punctuated by a medley of soft, soothing sounds. As he makes his rounds at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans, Jim Grillo, V05, is a man in his element. The zoo, which has about fifteen hundred animals living on fifty-eight acres, is known for its tropical species, naturally suited to the zoo's parklike terrain, with its stands of live oak and dangling Spanish moss. The sixty-four-year-old Grillo is one of three full-time vets working here. He radiates an easy, unassuming manner that must have served him well during the twenty-five years when his patients were human and he was a head and neck surgeon in New York City\u2014before he made his dramatic midlife shift into veterinary medicine. He's not the typical big-city surgeon who powers his way forward by sheer force of personality. Rather, this doctor steals up on you without fanfare. \"Uh, hello,\" he says quietly, glancing down.

ANIMALS By Bruce M OrG AN Ph OtOG rA Ph s By AlO NsO Ni ch Ol s30 tufts magazine fall 2012Two powerfully coiled Bengal tigers await us at the first stop on his rounds. Grillo clucks to them through the bars. \"Who's my boy? Who's my big boy?\" he says to the nearest cat. The tiger responds with a low, throaty exhalation known as chuffing, indicating contentment, Grillo says. Neither tiger needs medical atten - tion today. Next door, an Indonesian pig called a babirusa, with small, tightly curved tusks on either side of the snout, instinc - tively flops down to have her back stroked as Grillo approaches. \"She's kind of shy,\" he notes as he caresses the pig through the bars while murmuring, again and again, \"Who's my girl, who's my girl, who's my good girl?\" Droppings the size of grapefruit dot the floor of the giant shed leading to the next consultation. Two elephants stand side by side in the open air, tended by a young woman. One is forty-eight years old, the other thirty-nine. They have been together for more than three decades. Grillo leans on the enclosure fence, beaming at the pair before entering to examine them. As one elephant lifts a giant foot for inspection, it occurs to me\u2014strangely, but also obviously\u2014that these patients can't talk. If they have been hurt, they can't say how. If they feel pain, they can't say where. This makes treatment some - thing of a guessing game, but there's also a positive side to the animals' muteness. \"They can't lie to you,\" says the doctor archly. The animals have to be observed closely for changes in behavior\u2014a slack - ening of appetite, a hitch in the stride. \"That's why I like to be out with the ani-mals as much as I can,\" Grillo says. Some animals give up their medical history more easily than others. A male rhinoceros, for example, is unfazed by the concerted clapping and calling of Grillo and a staffer, who are determined to get the huge, armor-clad animal to swing toward them for a quick exami - nation. Eventually, the beast gazes at them, or somewhat toward them. This rhino appears to be doing fine. A second rhino, a female, recently had one of her two horns knocked off\u2014no one knows how\u2014and Grillo has treated the site of the injury. \"She's recovering nicely,\" he says, after examining the spot and pat - ting her lightly on the head.

She is twenty-five years old, somewhat arthritic in her late middle age, and recover - ing from a toe infection that required daily treatment for about a year. Grillo approaches her with a wide grin. \"Been awhile, Daphne, been awhile,\" he mur - murs before dropping to his knees beside her and hugging her around the neck. \"Hey, my sweetie,\" he says. Daphne's eyes get squinty and her head rears back as he strokes her belly\u2014signs of tapir bliss, according to a young staffer standing nearby. Animals with chronic conditions are the ones Grillo forms the strongest attachments to. \"You get to love them,\" the doc explains. \"Daphne had us all worried for a while.\" grillo has enjoyed being near ani - mals throughout his life. They embody for him a quality he describes as \"mysti - cal.\" It was entirely in keeping with his character that on his first day in New York City\u2014after completing medical school at Dartmouth and entering sur - gical residency at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan\u2014he should venture over to the Bronx Zoo. He thought he might offer his services, both as a physician to the staff and as a consultant on surgical procedures. There he met Emil Dolensek, the zoo's legendary chief veterinarian. \"He was the best person I ever knew, and the most profound influence in my life,\" Grillo says. During his residency, the young surgeon spent two days a week at the zoo, and remained in touch with Dolensek after launching his surgical practice, right up until his mentor's death in 1990. Then, in 1999, Grillo hit one of those turning points in life, after he was diag - nosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Long days spent lying in the hospital and, later, rounds of chemotherapy gave him ample time to think about his path, and in par - ticular the road not traveled, the road lined with animals, which he still had time left to explore. In 2001 Grillo shut down his practice and entered veterinary school at Tufts. He was fifty-three, older by far than any other student. The transition had its challenges. Grillo worried he had forgotten much of the science he once knew cold. The approach of his first chemistry quiz filled him with dread. He was too modest to tell his colleagues about his career as a surgeon. And yet, one of his professors, Larry Engelking, recalls, \"he proceeded to jump right up to the top of the class.\" Determined to work at a zoo when he graduated, he applied for jobs around the country and was hired at Audubon in the fall of 2006. Out among the animals, the applause is slight. One of Grillo's favorite patients\u2014though he's reluctant to say \"favorite\" aloud for fear of offending oth - ers in his care\u2014is a ruffed lemur named Stella, age twenty-nine, whose problems include a cardiac murmur and a chronic infection in one foot. Grillo has already performed several surgeries on her. \"Once they're in their late twenties, sometimes there may not be much you can do,\" he says, and you can hear the comforting tone that he must have employed with patients and their families during his sur - gical days back in Manhattan. A lemur is a monkey-like creature, but the kindness translates well. Alone, Grillo enters an area that con - tains a moat and some small trees and a rounded hut, like something out of The Flintstones . There he drops down on one knee to examine Stella. First, he strokes her tenderly to calm her. Then he says, \"Let's listen,\" applying his stethoscope to her skinny chest. He continues talking quietly to her for a while, unobserved except by a photog - rapher and me. We are twenty yards dis - tant, standing on an arched bridge over a culvert, unable to hear most of what he's saying. It's a cloudy Monday morn - ing in New Orleans. There's a rush from a waterfall behind us and the sound of tropical birds squawking and pealing high in the wind.

Lehrer has been trying to improve the channelized culvert in various ways since the late 1990s, when she and her kids would join volunteer cleanup crews to haul out trash. But in recent years, her work on the L.A. River has become more transfor - mational. A renowned landscape architect specializing in large environmental and infrastructure projects, Lehrer designed the City of Los Angeles' master plan for the river, which looks to completely remake it. The master plan is a $3 billion public- works project that will take decades to bring to fruition, funded by a complex web of city, state, and federal sources, includ - ing a White House initiative, America's Great Outdoors. Ultimately, the plan will restore thirty-two miles of the river and transform the areas around it with green open space and smart development. Creating an oasis of parkland within a sprawling metropolis has irresistible appeal. And yet even the architect remak - ing it has some fondness for the current concrete behemoth. \"No matter what you think of it, it's a beautifully engineered piece of infrastructure,\" Lehrer says. \"A lot of it is pretty exquisite.\" To the world at large, the L.A. River is as recognizable a feature of the city as the big HOLLYWOOD sign up in the hills. The channel has served as a movie set for countless films, including Grease , Chinatown , The Italian Job , and 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day , in which California's future governor raced through it on a motorcycle with a cyborg-driven semi in hot pursuit. At public talks she gives about the master plan, Lehrer includes such scenes in a video tribute to the river's pop-culture status.The Army Corps of Engineers built the river's concrete culverts in the 1930s for flood control\u2014which became neces - sary when freeways, neighborhoods, and commercial development encroached on the flood plains. While the project served its purpose, it also carved up the city, isolating communities from each other. Over time, a movement to remake the river took hold among the public and within local government. Enter Lehrer, who came to Tufts from a worldly background in her native El Salvador (her father was the Salvadoran ambassador to Israel for ten years, and Mia was one of five siblings who all went to college abroad). Lehrer began study - ing architecture at a time when the field was becoming more multidisciplinary, integrating elements of city planning, geology, and hydrology. She pursued a self-designed major at Tufts called envi - ronmental design, then earned a master's in landscape architecture at Harvard. f all 2012 tufts magazine 37Drawn to water early on, she wrote her Tufts thesis on the destruction wrought by the damming of a Salvadoran river. \"We've since learned a lot how not to treat rivers,\" she says. \"But rivers can be very daunting, complex projects.\" When she set up her practice in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, she found that her multidisciplinary training lent itself well to waterfront projects. In addition to many inland transformations\u2014the rede - velopment of Hollywood Park, for exam - ple, and the conversion of a Marine base into Orange County Great Park\u2014she continually returns to coastal areas and riverfronts. One such project is the rede - velopment of a river in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, a long-term undertaking she describes as difficult because of the region's rudimen - tary sewer systems. The L.A. River is more complex still. \"It's easy to look at most rivers and see that that's what they are,\" Lehrer says. \"There's a lot of water, green edges. But in L.A., the river has concrete edges, nobody goes there, and it's something that sepa - rates rather than unites the city.\" With the arid climate, the river fills up only in periods of heavy rain. \"Most of the time,\" Lehrer says, \"it's a gash through the city.\" But a gash can be healed. Lehrer's architectural firm entered a competition sponsored by the Los Angeles City Council to design the master plan for revitalizing the river, and won it in 2009. Parts of the plan\u2014bikeways, small parks, and such\u2014are being built as demonstration projects to give people a feel for the more ambitious components still in the works. In all, there are three hundred projects to implement: parks, greenways, bridges (pedestrian and automotive alike), and mixed-use com - mercial/residential development with clean technology. Some of the old river - side buildings will be preserved and repur - posed. There's talk, Lehrer says, of turning an erstwhile minimum-security jail into a museum about the river's history. To control flooding, the river will be deepened. During times of heavy rain, a network of temporary inflatable dams will control water flow. Removing the steep concrete banks will also create a more natural environment for animals. Done right, the river's metamorpho - sis could turn what was once a boundary into a greenway network that unifies the city\u2014turning barriers into bridges. \"My vision is to create a new kind of place that brings communities together socially, economically, and environmentally,\" Lehrer says. \"This is an opportunity to bring all that together and create a sense of place along the river\u2014from grey to green, from concrete and asphalt to a better-functioning place.\" T DAviD M e nconi is the music critic at the News & Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina, the author of a biography of the musician Ryan Adams, and a frequent contributor to this magazine.Left: The L.A.

As a man of means, he combined these passions with a hope to both develop technical skills and provide a service to society. Using the best technol - ogy of the day, and a captive and thus patient subject pool, Galton set out to reveal the essential criminal face. This was a tall order, and one made no easier given the state of photography in the late 1800s. Galton\u2014a versatile scientist and inventor\u2014designed his own equipment and perfected a method of combining the likenesses of different subjects into a single blended image. The logic, like the eventual images, was flawless: superimposing images would allow for meaningless variation to drift into the background, while pulling essential similarities to the foreground. Surely what shone through should be the pure criminal essence. With the prototypical criminal face thus identified, trials could be sped up, and individuals might even be sequestered before they fulfilled their criminal destiny. But that isn't what happened. When Galton completed his task, he was surprised to find that the prototypi - cal criminal face was . . . beautiful. He had become the accidental father of a new approach to understanding which features humans find attractive. When the images were combined, each individual's small imperfec - tions\u2014wrinkles, scars, or blemishes\u2014disappeared from the final photo. The resulting composite faces appeared youthful and healthy. Humans find these characteristics especially attrac - tive, as they indicate fertility. And it isn't surprising that we are attracted to traits indicating fertil - ity. From an evolutionary perspective, choosing a partner is particularly important. Not only should we be attracted to fertile individuals, but we should also be attracted to individuals with the best genes. But how do you infer someone's genetic quality just by looking at the person? Again, Galton's prototypical criminal face suggests an answer. One variation that faded to the background in the composite images was the slight deviation we all have from bilateral symmetry. The resulting image was of a highly symmetrical face. Many biologists today think that symmetry is a reliable external indicator of good genes. Research has shown that we rate highly symmetrical faces more attrac - tive, that we are more committed to highly symmetrical partners, and even that sex with a symmetrical partner is more fulfilling. Some provocative data even suggest that the willingness to cheat on a partner is influenced by that person's degree of symmetry relative to the prospective lover's. Our choice of mate, of course, is based on a suite of characteristics, not just facial attractiveness. Moreover, our choices differ according to our gender, our age, our experiences, and our current and long-term goals. But to the extent that faces matter, Galton's accidental uncovering of traits that we commonly associate with attractiveness remains significant. As a means of identifying criminal facial types, his photographic technique became as irrelevant as another one of his ideas: eugenics, a field with its own well-earned social stigma. But in fair - ness to Galton, I should point out that he also invented twin studies, devel - oped statistical techniques, showed how fingerprints could be classified for forensics, produced the first weather map, and much more. But for a biologist like myself who both adores and is fascinated by the human animal, his lasting message is especially satisfying. Galton was the first to use science to show that when you look at enough of us, and allow the variation to fade to the background, what emerges is undeniable: as a collec - tive, humans are inherently beautiful. Philip Starks , an associate professor of biology at Tufts, studies the social behavior of animals, with an emphasis on insects. the human animal Inherently Beautiful A Victorian experiment revealed much about faces by Phili P Stark S illus Tr a Ti ons: dan pageThe willingness to cheat on a partner may be influenced by that person's symmetry relative to the prospective lover's. f all 2012 tufts magazine 39 in the aftermath of the penn State scandal, I am sometimes asked if my view of college sports has changed. The answer is no. I believe what I have long believed: that the Division III approach to college sports\u2014the approach embraced by Tufts\u2014is the right one. This is not to say that all the athletic programs at the large, sports-oriented Division I schools have lost their way. Certainly there are dedicated coaches working at that level who care deeply about the young men and women they coach. But it is also true that the influence of money\u2014 big money\u2014has seriously distorted the role of competitive sports at many Division I institutions. What distinguishes Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association from Division I is this: Division III schools do not offer athletic scholarships, and must follow rules that seek to manage the time that players devote to sports\u2014say, by limiting the number of contests, weeks of practice, and even hours of practice. These rules support an environ - ment where players take great pride in their sports commitment, but not at the expense of their academic experience. They are true student-athletes. At a uni - versity like Tufts, sports should be in syn - ergy with academics, not in competition with it. While the academic experience is clearly the lifeblood of the institution, experiences outside of the classroom, such as varsity sports, complement that education in significant ways. Division III is about balance and commitment to excellence in all phases of life. In the athletics arena one learns about working hard, bouncing back, and, above all, teamwork. A few years ago, a Cornell College baseball player summed up Division III this way: It's a bigger part of us than our friends and family can understand. Sometimes we play for two thousand fans; some - times twenty-five. But we still play hard. You cheer for us because you know us. You know more than just our names. Like all of you, we are students first. We don't sign autographs. But we do sign graduate school applications, MCAT exams, and student body peti - tions. . . . We train hard, lift, throw, run, kick, tackle, shoot, dribble, and lift some more, and in the morning we go to class. Tufts athletes reflect the values of that quote. They are dedicated, hard - working, and talented. They strive to win, and hurt when they lose. But in the morning, they go to class. Just as important, our coaches are in the business for the right reason: to teach through the vehicle of sport. When we hire new coaches, we look first for passion\u2014passion for the sport, pas - sion for working with young people. We then look for communication skills and an understanding of teambuilding. Sport knowledge and track record are also important, but not at the expense of these personal qualities. We look for leaders who understand why Tufts invests in sports: for its educational value. Coaches like this can be wonderful influences in the lives of young people. We also understand that sports can strengthen a community. Last year, we started an initiative called Fan the Fire: Spirit, Sports, and Service (you can learn about it at bit.ly/fanthefire ). At first, our goal was to draw more support for our teams by creating events that highlighted both sports competition and charities that our teams support. The women's soccer team, for example, is affiliated with Team Impact, an organization that brings student athletes together in service of children with life-threatening illnesses. But we quickly saw the poten-tial for extending the reach of Fan the Fire beyond sports. As students began to attend games and meets for the first time\u2014attracted by the connection to public service\u2014they began to form rela - tionships with the athletes. The athletes, in turn, began attending these students' activities. As a member of our baseball team put it: \"This is really about more than drawing fans to games. It's about building one Tufts.\" And that's it in a nutshell. At Tufts, our athletes are students like everyone else. They sleep in the same dorms, eat the same food, take the same exams, and strive to make the most of their academic experience. They're also pas - sionate about sports\u2014and thankfully, in Division III, they can aspire to excel - lence in both. bill Gehling, director of athletics, has been at Tufts for more than forty years as a student, a soccer coach, and an administrator. guest thinker Sports Versus Academics Division III strikes the right balance by William Gehlin G, a7 4, G7940 tufts magazine fall 2012 think tank to mourn his uncle, and was honored above all the hundreds of royalty by his place at the very front of the funeral cortege, mounted next to the dead king's only surviving brother. The next day, the Times of London acknowledged that to Wilhelm \"belongs the first place among all the foreign mourners.\" A year later, most of the kings reappeared for the splendid inauguration of King George V. Many of them had played as children together when visiting their English grandmother, Victoria. The czar of Russia called his first cousin, the German Kaiser, \"Willy\"; Wilhelm addressed his intimate Kremlin letters to \"Nicky.\" On the other side of the Atlantic, the Democratic Party convention held in Baltimore from June 25 to July 2 was deadlocked, and on the forty-sixth ballot nominated the governor of New Jersey, a former Princeton professor, son of an evangelical Presbyterian minister, as a compromise candidate: Woodrow Wilson. Foreign policy was on few people's minds. Wilson's mandate was to reform national politics and to insti - tute progressive reform at home. He felt deeply that God would help him make the right decisions. Wilson would soon need the help. Contrary to the social scientists' assurances, blood relations could not prevent bloodshed. Nationalism and eth - nic hatred in the Balkans would eventu - ally defy all reason. The assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne in late June 1914 led within six weeks to a war that involved all of Europe and soon spread around the world. Looking back, we can only marvel at how invisible the signs of impending cataclysm can be, and at how easily we embrace the comforting notion that our civilization has finally moved beyond its propensity for war.

Many were indeed home by Christmas, especially officers in cof - fins, those elder sons who led the initial charges, only to be greeted by thirty-caliber water-cooled machine guns, courtesy of Krupp. The life expectancy of a British officer arriving at the front in the first year of the war was less than an hour. Although poison gas contributed to only four percent of the casualties, it was enough for many Europeans to call World War I the Chemists' War. Fritz Haber, the German professor who led the military research team in the cre - ation of lethal gases, won a 1918 Nobel Prize. By Armistice Day, November 11, 1918, there were nine million dead sol - diers, and with ghastly symmetry, nine million dead four-legged pack animals. It was only the beginning. Progress in the invention of killing machines has been one of the hallmarks of the past century: from simple poison gas to the sophisticated nuclear, biologi - cal, and chemical weapons of today, from primitive wooden biplanes to the enor - mous air forces of World War II, then the jet, the invisible stealth planes, now the drone. In air and on sea, the advance in weaponry in the past hundred years has been breathtaking. Without it, the 200 million casualties of war would not have been possible. No doubt we will still be counting beyond 2014. A century ago, the Great War was just two years away. Did anyone real - ize in 1912 that the world soon would plunge into an abyss? There was vague talk of war, and there were a few skir - mishes in the Balkans, but these caused little concern to the major powers. Social scientists the world over declared war to be impossible, considering how interwoven were the economies\u2014and the ruling houses\u2014of the potential combatants. At Edward VII's funeral in May 1910, nine European kings, all related to each other, rode in the funeral procession to Westminster Abbey. Kaiser Wilhelm II, the emperor of Germany, was dressed in the uniform of a British field marshall the british and americans cannot wait for the actual centenary to commemorate the Great War of 1914-1918 and the peace treaty that followed. Public television's Downton Abbey and Steven Spielberg's War Horse signaled the beginning of this historical reexamination, and there's more to come. The BBC has produced a five-part adaptation by Tom Stoppard of Ford Madox Ford's monu-mental series of war novels, Parade's End. The Library of America is publish - ing in a single edition the two remark - able World War I histories of Barbara Tuchman, The Guns of August and The Proud Tower, edited by the historian Margaret MacMillan, whose Paris, 1919 is arguably the best analysis of the peace treaty that ended one world war and set the stage for the next one. We don't seem to be able to get enough of a war that proved horrific beyond all imagination, the first truly technological triumph in the name of mass death. Few anticipated what was to come. Just before the guns of August began firing in 1914, the last order given to the British officer corps was to sharpen sabers for the charge. \"Home by Christmas!\" cheered the crowds at Piccadilly as they watched their boys march off to glorious battle against an enemy called the Hun by enthusiastic scholar at large The Sleep of Innocence The world on the eve of the Great War by SOl Gi ttleman f all 2012 tufts magazine 41 combatants came together for seminars on negotiation and peace building. Establishing good communication is paramount. Too often, negotiators assume that communication between the two sides will happen naturally once they begin working together. Instead, they should set up a schedule of regular meetings to review progress. And in international arrangements, it is crucial to minimize any language barrier. In one joint venture between an American and a French company, the two sides, which had some knowledge of the oth - er's language, nevertheless agreed that they would use interpreters. Meetings were twice as long as normal, but better communication paid off. Above all, the parties working to build a relationship must show respect for one another. Each side must recog - nize that the other brings something valuable to their common enterprise. They need to treat one another as equals. To say\u2014as one U.S. executive did to a partner from a developing country\u2014\"Let me do the thinking for both of us\" only undermines relations. Consider involving a third party. Third parties can help resolve conflicts, provide needed resources, and verify that both sides are holding up their end of the bargain. For example, the United States, which helped broker a treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1979, has been vital to maintaining peace between the two countries ever since. So think about involving an appropriate outsider in the next tough deal you negotiate. Jeswald W. Salacuse is the Henry J. Braker professor of law and former dean of the Fletcher sc hool at Tufts. His most recent book is The Law of Investment Treaties ( ox ford u niversity p ress).parts. Once a team had signed a deal, it would move on to the next negotiation, leaving to other executives the difficult task of figuring out how to carry out the new joint venture. Some managers called the practice \"throwing the deal over the wall.\" GM's reliance on special negotia- tion teams slowed and complicated the execution of the joint ventures. First, it gave negotiators, whose bonuses hinged on the number of deals they closed, every reason to downplay potential imple - mentation problems, such as a partner's questionable manufacturing experience. Second, the GM executives charged with carrying out the deals were effectively denied access to the knowledge the negotiating teams gained and the rela - tionships they forged. GM's experience provides a lesson for us all: when agents or employees negotiate on your behalf, make sure they have strong incentives to plan for implementing the deal. bu ild relationships. A relationship is a kind of connection that usually implies a degree of trust between the parties. Such trust is vital in making a deal work since, as the Oslo Accords experience has shown, implementa- tion always involves risks for some - body. Trust in the other side, based on a sound relationship, helps reduce perceived risks. One essential step in relationship building is to ensure that the parties are well acquainted. For companies plan - ning a joint venture or a merger, a retreat in a relaxed setting might allow the two sides' executives to discuss their respec - tive organizational visions and cultures. Joint training can also be effective. When the African National Congress and the white South African government sought d\u00e9tente, the leaders of the former negotiating liFe The Endgame, Part II Putting the deal into practice by J e S W a ld W. Sala CuSe the toughest challenge in any negotiation is not closing the deal (the subject of my Winter 2012 column) but making the deal work. The annals of negotiation are littered with deals that somehow were never car - ried out. The world is still waiting for the permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinians promised by the 1993 Oslo Accords, for example. Closer to home, you may still be waiting for repayment of the thousand dollars you lent to your cousin five years ago. Here are three guidelines to help increase the chances that your next negotiation will produce the outcome you want. Plan methodically. Develop a list of questions about how the deal will work, and prepare a tentative plan for implementation, specifying who does what, when, and how. Negotiators fail to push hard on implementation for sev - eral reasons. Some just haven't thought about it carefully. Others fear that too great a focus on such concerns will slow the process or stop it dead in its tracks. Still others work for organizations that inadvertently encourage them not to think about implementation. General Motors, for example, created special teams for negotiating foreign joint ventures to manufacture vehicles and To say\u2014as one U.S. executive did to a partner\u2014\"Let me do the thinking for both of us\" only undermines relations.42 tufts magazine fall 2012 creations your ventures in the arts and media by kara peters Photo: james gladerBerlin, so I wanted to showcase the food that was synonymous with Germany for me\u2014dishes like quarkauflauf (a souffl\u00e9 made with quark, a fresh, sour cheese), really good, super vinegary potato salad, and elderflower syrup.

We hear you have a soft spot for Carmichael. I lived in Carmichael for four years. In my freshman year, there was a group of us on the first floor who became really good friends, so we decided to stay together sophomore year.

They were so out of the box.\" She opens a file on her laptop and reads aloud her response to an application question: \"Tell us, briefly, what is Tufts?\" Tufts, she wrote, is home to \"Jumbo maximus , a rare species of stu - dents and professors\" who thrive in an environment \"where diversity and open-mindedness are treasured.\" Tufts offered everything Reyes was looking for. The students were \"very fo-cused, very driven,\" and the faculty were not only among the best in their field but also approachable. The chance to study international relations, one of Tufts' most popular majors, exerted a power - ful pull: she dreamed of a career working ad van Ce ment giving. g Ro wth. g Ra titude. s part of a drive to boost financial aid for undergraduates in Arts, Sciences, and Engineering, Tufts is offering to match any newly established endowed scholarship greater than $100,000, thereby doubling the scholarship. It's called the Financial Aid Initiative, and it's part of an effort to raise $25 million in endowed scholarships for undergrads in AS&E. Even after the university's most ambitious fundraising campaign ever, demand for financial aid remains pressing. That's because, in tough economic times like these, more families require more aid. Scholarship dollars are critical to closing the college affordability gap. Hence the Financial Aid Initiative. Such aid can make all the difference in putting a Tufts education within a student's reach. Endowed scholarships open a world of opportunity. Take it from these students who have received them.A f all 2012 tufts magazine 65 financial aid is helping louie zong, A13, pursue not just one dream but three. He is majoring in civil engi - neering, minoring in studio art, and playing jazz piano. \"It's been a terrific experience,\" he says in his soft-spoken manner. \"Tufts and the financial aid I've received have enabled me to expe - rience all the facets of the things I en - joy. It's a great place and in a great city. It's got it all.\" Zong was drawn to the School of Engineering because of a lifelong fascination with transit systems. He says his Tufts experience has taught him to think about engineering in a different way. He says his instructor in a class on computer-aided design, Lee Monardi, \"is as much interested in teaching engineering as he is art.\" That's a natural juncture for Zong. Since arriving at Tufts from the Utica, New York, area, he has also developed his natural artistic gifts (see samples of his work at louiezong.daportfolio.com). \"I never took an art class before on global issues, particularly fair trade. \"International relations is close to my heart,\" says Reyes. \"It embraces my heritage and culture, and gives me purpose.\" Reyes grew up in Wilmington, Delaware, the daughter of Colombian immigrants\u2014her father a physician and her mother the manager of his practice. She says they both gave her the confidence to take a stand on time - ly and complex issues. In high school, she spearheaded a model UN and competed on the mock trial team. Now she brings that high energy to her Tufts studies and activi - ties. Fluent in Spanish, she is learning Portuguese. She juggles coursework with service on the executive board for the sorority Chi Omega and a work-study job at the Tower Caf\u00e9 in Tisch Library. She has been active in the Tufts Dance Coalition and has traveled to the Andes for a summer internship with Threads of Peru, a nonprofit that helps Quechua women market their woven goods. It was an experience, she says, that awakened her to the challenges and rewards of fair market practices that aim to help remote Andean com - munities. \"It takes a lot of time, energy, and money to provide the resources for these women to be able to weave and sell their products,\" she says. Looking ahead, she expects to travel more, and perhaps pursue graduate studies at the Fletcher School. For now, though, she is making the most of her undergraduate expe - rience\u2014which might not have been possible without the Gregory G. and Christine D. Randolph Scholarship. With her younger sister approaching college age, financial aid is a significant support for her family. \"I am grateful for the kind donations of alumni and friends of the university, such as the Randolphs, for giving me the opportu - nity to study at Tufts,\" Reyes says. \"It's a place where I have been able to ex - plore my interests and push my limits, and that has become my home.\" Louie Zong ro bert l.

Pho to: corbiss an athlete, peter dolan, a78, a08p, has run marathons, com - peted in triathlons, and completed the grueling Hawaii Ironman challenge. As a philanthropist, he is tackling an even bigger challenge: childhood obesity. A Tufts University trustee and former CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dolan and his wife, Katie, have donated $1 million to a national initiative known as ChildObesity180, which he is chairing at the Friedman School. ChildObesity180 ( www.childobesity180.org ) seeks to become a major catalyst for prioritizing and driving the necessary systemic changes to reverse the trend of child - hood obesity within a generation. Founded in 2009, ChildObesity180 draws on the expertise and reach of senior decision-makers from the highest levels of government, academia, public health advocacy, community organizations, the food industry, and the media to drive an integrated national strategy to prevent childhood obesity. With this new donation, Peter and Katie Dolan have added to their previous gifts and pledges to Tufts University in support of financial aid, the Summer Scholars undergraduate research program, the Tufts Marathon Challenge, the School of Medicine, and athletics. tu rning ar ound an Epidemic Philanthropy fuels a strategy to prevent childhood obesity Tufts,\" he says. Now, through the uni - versity's affiliation with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, he has studied animation, children's book illustration, and comic book art. Skilled at merging images and type, he digitally illustrated a children's book written by fellow students. For a project for a civil engineering class, Zong illustrated an alphabet book about concepts in geotechnical engineering. \"On occasion I see art as a release from engineering,\" he says. \"But just as often, I believe art and engineering are connected: I am a visual thinker, and art allows me to convey what's in my mind more easily.\" He is particularly fond of car - tooning. One project is an animated online cartoon series called The Sun Also Rises . In addition, the Tufts Daily regularly runs his editorial cartoons and a comic strip that he describes as a slice of life, \"like Calvin and Hobbes but a bit less philosophical.\" With an internship at Fablevision Studios, a Boston-based animation company, his art portfolio continues to expand. Then there is piano. He has played with the Tufts Jazz Orchestra and per - formed in small jazz groups. Recently he got together with friends to form a trio to play Sinatra-style music in local clubs. Does he see some overlap between engineering and jazz? \"They use the same kind of mindset,\" he says. \"You're thinking on your feet to solve a problem.\" Zong has kept a close eye on ex - penses while attending college. He has held part-time and summer jobs as a house painter and as an arts-and-crafts coordinator at a day care center in Arlington, Massachusetts. With both parents working in aca - demia and with a younger brother, Zong was in need of a generous fi - nancial aid package. He is profoundly grateful for his scholarship: \"It's com - pletely accurate to say that I would not be here without this generous gift,\" he says. A f all 2012 tufts magazine 67 The Dolans' latest gift supports the fundraising campaign under way for this large-scale campaign to make our kids healthier. ChildObesity180 was publicly launched last fall with a $6.9 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and $14.6 mil - lion in total funding has been raised so far. \"This epidemic is too important to wait another moment,\" says Christina Economos, N96, the Friedman School's New Balance Chair in Childhood Nutrition, who is vice chair and direc - tor of ChildObesity180. \"Childhood obesity is the preemi - nent public health issue of our time,\" she says. \"Today, one-third of children in America are overweight or obese and on track to experience catastrophic health conditions, swamp health-care budgets, and create unprecedented challenges across society.\" The Dolan gift will provide core sup - port for ChildObesity180 and serve as an engine to advance the group's work, says the project's codirector, Miriam Nelson, N85, N87, professor and director of the John Hancock Research Center on Physical Activity, Nutrition, and Obesity Prevention at the Friedman School. \"Peter is an amazing champion and leader for ChildObesity180,\" she adds. Robin Kanarek, interim dean of the Friedman School, notes: \"Without Peter's vision and leadership, ChildObesity180 would not be possible. We are proud to be working with him to reverse the obesity epidemic in this country.\" ChildObesity180 takes a high-level view of all activities in the childhood obesity field and analyzes them to de - termine the best, most actionable and impactful opportunities. Through its unique decision-making matrix, the leadership of ChildObesity180 has reviewed a comprehensive set of evi - dence-based obesity prevention recom - mendations and identified four priority areas on which to focus: children's ac - cess to healthier foods, physical activity, marketing to children, and eating out in restaurants.To address these strategic areas and promote a collective impact, ChildObesity180 is developing and exe - cuting a portfolio of initiatives designed to affect numerous aspects of a child's daily environment. This past February, with help from First Lady Michelle Obama, ChildObesity180 launched a nationwide competition for innova - tion in school-based physical activity as part of its Active Schools Acceleration Project. \"We know there's so much good work going on all across this country to get our kids up and moving every single day,\" Obama said in a video announcing the Active Schools Acceleration Project Competition, which ran through April. \"So we want to find the best school programs and technology ideas that in - crease physical activity for kids\u2014and then help them reach even more chil - dren throughout America.\" In the spring, the innovation com - petition\u2014supported by more than $1.2 million from 13 of the nation's lead - ing health-insurance companies and foundations\u2014awarded $500,000 in prizes, with individual awards of up to $100,000, for the most creative, impact - ful, and scalable programs and techno - logical innovations that promote quality physical activity for children during the school day. The next step will be for the Active Schools Acceleration Project to replicate the winning models on a larger scale, with the goal of achieving sustain - able quality physical activity in schools. The Active Schools Acceleration Project was the second initiative launched by ChildObesity180. The first, Healthy Kids Out of School, is a col - laboration among nine of the nation's largest after-school, sports, and extra - curricular organizations. Convened by ChildObesity180, the leaders of these groups developed and adopted universal nutrition and physical activity principles from a broad list of evidence-based rec - ommendations for combating child - hood obesity. Detailed implementation plans are under way, and a three-year, $1.5 million grant from the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Foundation will help catalyze these efforts. Through its portfolio of high-im - pact, evidence-based initiatives and its commitment to research and evalua - tion, ChildObesity180 will continue to bring partners to the table to work to - gether in pursuit of a common mission: reversing the trend of childhood obesity within a generation, says Economos.

Be mindful of the moment you are together, remaining present and en - gaged. Don't worry about what you are going to say next. Settle into silences. Illness, the effects of medication, or a topic's emotional weight may slow mental processes. Silences give your loved one time to think, so don't ramble on to fill in the blanks. Show acceptance and respect. Refrain from judgment or unsolicited advice. And avoid saying \"I know how you feel.\" A common response is \"You have no idea.\" Allow the person to define his or her own feelings. Be comfortable talking about death. Shying away when your loved one tries to speak about death and dying can make him or her feel more isolated.
