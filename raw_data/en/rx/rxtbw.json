pneumonia to ARDS Complications Typically associated with the phenomenon of Cytokine storm Lung injury leads to reduced surfactant & reduced gas exchange in the alveoli Leads to massive vascular inflammation, shock, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation & multi-organ dysfunction Vaccination holds the key to tackle his epidemic Outline Planning & development Current scenario Vaccine types & mechanisms Efficacy & action against variants Chief vaccines & trial results Other approved vaccines & vaccines pending authorization Distribution & inequality concerns India's vaccine development & distribution General prevention strategies Hospital preparedness Early days Vaccine for an infectious disease never been produced in less than several years No vaccine existed for preventing a corona virus infection in humans Established body of knowledge about the structure and function of corona-viruses causing diseases like SARS CoV-1 & MERS Enabled accelerated development of various vaccine technologies during early 2020 On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data shared By 19 March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID-19 Initiation Since January 2020, vaccine development expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments Basic steps Safety Targeting vulnerable populations Need for vaccine efficacy breakthroughs Duration of vaccination protection Special delivery systems (such as oral or nasal, rather than by injection) Dose regimen Stability and storage characteristics Dissemination of the licensed vaccine Challenges Urgency compressed schedules that shortened the standard vaccine development timeline Compromising safety assurance Research at universities obstructed by physical distancing and closing Virus proved to be a \"moving target\" of changing transmission rates across and within countries Compete for trial participants Planning & development Current scenario Vaccine types & mechanisms Efficacy & action against variants Chief vaccines & trial results Other approved vaccines & vaccines pending authorization Distribution & inequality concerns India's vaccine development & distribution General prevention strategies Hospital preparedness Authorization 17 vaccines authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use RNA vaccines Pfizer-BioNTech Viral Vector Vaccines Oxford-AstraZeneca Moderna Sputnik Light Others in pipeline 308 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development With 73 in clinical research 24 in Phase I trials 33 in Phase I-II trials 16 in Phase III development First approval On 2/12/20 UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) gave temporary regulatory approval for the Pfizer- BioNTech vaccine On 1/01/21, (DCGI) approved emergency use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield) in India Planning & development Current scenario Vaccine types & mechanisms Efficacy & action against variants Chief vaccines & trial results Other approved vaccines & vaccines pending authorization Distribution & inequality concerns India's vaccine development & distribution General prevention strategies Hospital preparedness Platform & target Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials focused on the spike protein and its variants as the primary antigen Platform Being developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses Next generation strategies Precise targeting of COVID-19 infection mechanisms Use a 2P mutation to lock the spike protein into its prefusion configuration, stimulating an immune response to the virus before it attaches to a human cell RNA vaccine When introduced into a tissue, acts as mRNA to cause the cells to build the foreign protein and stimulate an adaptive immune response Delivery of mRNA is achieved by a co- formulation of the molecule into lipid nano- particles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells Approval status First to be approved in US, UK, EU In January 2021, Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna got approval In February 2021, the CVnCoV RNA vaccine from CureVac got authorization in EU Allergic reactions rare Inactivated virus vaccines Consist of virus particles that have been grown in culture and then are killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde to lose disease producing capacity, while still stimulating an immune response Adenovirus vector vaccines Non-replicating viral vector vaccines, using an adenovirus shell containing DNA that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 protein Convidecia and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine are both one-shot vaccines which offer less complicated logistics and can be stored under ordinary refrigeration for several months Subunit vaccines Present one or more antigens without introducing whole pathogen particles Antigens involved are often protein subunits, but can be any molecule that is a fragment of the pathogen Other types In clinical trials include Virus-like particle vaccines Multiple DNA plasmid vaccines Lentivirus vector vaccines Conjugate vaccine Vesicular stomatitis virus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Formulation To enhance immunogenicity Particularly effective for technologies using the inactivated virus and recombinant protein- based or vector-based vaccines Aluminum salts, the first adjuvant used for licensed vaccines, the adjuvant of choice in some 80% vaccines Outline Planning & development Current scenario Vaccine types & mechanisms Efficacy & action against
