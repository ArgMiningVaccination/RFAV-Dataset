Clinicians ed- ucate personnel and family mem- bers on evidence-based diagnosis, In October 2006, the American Acad-emy of Pediatrics (AAP) published the clinical practice guideline \"Diagnosis and Management of Bronchiolitis. \" 1 The guideline offered recommendations ranked according to level of evidence and the bene t-harm relationship. Since completion of the original evidence re- view in July 2004, a signi cant body of literature on bronchiolitis has beenpublished. This update of the 2006 AAP bronchiolitis guideline evaluates pub- lished evidence, including that used in the 2006 guideline as well as evidence published since 2004. Key action state- ments (KASs) based on that evidence are provided. The goal of this guideline is to provide an evidence-based approach to the di- agnosis, management, and prevention of bronchiolitis in children from 1 month through 23 months of age. The guidelineis intended for pediatricians, family physicians, emergency medicine spe- cialists, hospitalists, nurse practitioners, PEDIATRICS Volume 134, Number 5, November 2014 e1475FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS at Stony Brook University on October 29, 2014 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from and physician assistants who care for these children. The guideline does not apply to children with immunode cien- cies, including those with HIV infection or recipients of solid organ or hema- topoietic stem cell transplants. Childrenwith underlying respiratory illnesses,such as recurrent wheezing, chronic neonatal lung disease (also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia), neuro-muscular disease, cystic brosis and signi cant congenital heart disease are excludedfrom the sections on management un- less otherwise noted but are included in the discussion of prevention. This guide-line will not address long-term sequelaeof bronchiolitis, such as recurrent wheezing or risk of asthma, which is aeld with a large and distinct lit- erature. Bronchiolitis is a disorder commonly caused by viral lower respiratory tract infection in infants. Bronchiolitis is characterized by acute in flammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells lining small airways, and increased mucus production. Signs and symp- toms typically begin with rhinitis andcough, which may progress to tachy-pnea, wheezing, rales, use of accessory muscles, and/or nasal flaring. 2 Many viruses that infect the respiratory system cause a similar constellation of signs and symptoms. The most com- mon etiology of bronchiolitis is re-spiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with the highest incidence of infection occurring between December and March in NorthAmerica; however, regional variations occur 3(Fig 1).4Ninety percent of chil- dren are infected with RSV in the rst 2 years of life,5a n du pt o4 0 %w i l l experience lower respiratory tract in-fection during the initial infection. 6,7 Infection with RSV does not grant per- manent or long-term immunity, with reinfections common throughout life.8 Other viruses that cause bronchiolitis include human rhinovirus, human in fluenza, adenovirus, coronavirus, human, and parainfl u- enza viruses. In a study of inpatients and outpatients with 76% of 1% had para- influenza viruses (some patients had coinfections, so the total is greater than 100%). Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization among infants during therst 12 months of life. Approximately 100 000 bronchiolitis admissions occurannually in the United States at an estimated cost of $1.73 billion. 10One prospective, population-based studysponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported theaverage RSV hospitalization rate was 5.2 per 1000 children younger than 24 months of age during the 5-year pe- riod between 2000 and 2005. 11The highest age-speci c rate of RSV hos- pitalization occurred among infantsbetween 30 days and 60 days of age(25.9 per 1000 children). For preterm infants ( <37 weeks 'gestation), the RSV hospitalization rate was 4.6 per 1000 children, a number similar tothe RSV hospitalization rate for term infants of 5.2 per 1000. Infants born at<30 weeks 'gestation had the highest hospitalization rate at 18.7 children per 1000, although the small number of infants born before 30weeks 'gestation make this number unreliable. Other studies indicate theRSV hospitalization rate in extremely FIGURE 1 RSV season by US regions. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The sub- committee included primary care physi- cians, including general pediatricians, a family physician, and pediatric sub- specialists, including hospitalists, pul- monologists, emergency physicians, a neonatologist, and pediatric infectiousdisease physicians. The subcommit- tee also included an epidemiologist trained in systematic reviews, a guide- line methodologist/informatician, and a parent representative. All panel mem- bers reviewed the AAP Policy on Con flict of Interest and Voluntary Disclosure andwere given an opportunity to declare any potential con flicts. Any con flicts can be found in the author listing at the end ofthis guideline. All funding was providedby the AAP , with travel assistance from the American Academy of Family Phy- sicians, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Thoracic Society, and the American College of Emergency Physicians for their liaisons. The evidence search and review included electronic database searches in The Cochrane Library , Medline via Ovid, and CINAHL via EBSCO. The search strategy is shown in the Appendix. Re- lated article searches were conducted in PubMed. The bibliographies of arti-cles identi ed by database searches were also reviewed by 1 of 4 membersof the committee, and references iden- tied in this manner were added to the review. Articles included in the2003 evidence report on bronchiolitis in preparation of the AAP 2006 guide- line2 also were reviewed. In addition, the committee reviewed articles pub-lished after completion of the sys- tematic review for these updated guidelines. The current literature re-view encompasses the period from 2004 through May 2014. The evidence-based approach to guide- line development requires that the evi- dence in support of a policy be identi ed, appraised, and summarized and that anexplicit link between evidence and rec- ommendations be de ned. Evidence- based recommendations re flect the quality of evidence and the balance ofbene t and harm that is anticipated when the recommendation is followed.The AAP policy statement \"Classify- ing Recommendations for ClinicalPractice \" 14was followed in designat- ing levels of recommendation (Fig 2;Table 1). A draft version of this clinical practice guideline underwent extensive peer review by committees, councils, and sections within AAP; the American Thoracic Society, American College ofChest Physicians, American Academyof Family Physicians, and American College of Emergency Physicians; other outside organizations; and other in-dividuals identi ed by the subcom- mittee as experts in the eld. The resulting comments were reviewed by the subcommittee and, when ap- propriate, incorporated into the guide- line. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with bronchiolitis. Rather, it is intended to assist clinicians in decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with bronchi- olitis. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approachto the management of children with bronchiolitis. All AAP guidelines are reviewed every 5 years.

Most clinicians recognize bronchiolitis as a constellation of clin- ical signs and symptoms occurring in children younger than 2 years, includ-ing a viral upper respiratory tractprodrome followed by increased re- spiratory effort and wheezing. Clinical signs and symptoms of bronchiolitisconsist of rhinorrhea, cough, tachypnea,wheezing, rales, and increased and intercostal and/or subcostal retractions. The course of bronchiolitis is variable and dynamic, ranging from transient e v e n t s ,s u c ha sa p n e a ,t op r o g r e s s i v erespiratory distress from lower airwayobstruction. Important issues to assess in the history include the effects of re- spiratory symptoms on mental status,feeding, and hydration. The clinicianshould assess the ability of the family to care for the child and to return for further evaluation if needed. Historyof underlying conditions, such as pre-maturity, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease, immunode ciency, or episodes of previous wheezing, should be identi ed. Underlying conditions that may be associated with an increasedrisk of progression to severe disease or mortality include hemodynamically signi cant congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonarydysplasia), congenital anomalies, 15-17 in utero smoke exposure,18and the an immunocompromisingstate. 19,20 In addition, genetic abnormal- ities have been associated with more severe presentation with bronchiolitis.21 Assessment of a child with bronchiolitis, including the physical examination, can be complicated by variability in the dis- ease state and may require serialobservations over time to fully assess thechild's status. Upper airway obstruction contributes to work of breathing. Suc- tioning and positioning may decrease t h ew o r ko fb r e a t h i n ga n di m p r o v et h equality of the examination. Respiratoryrate in otherwise healthy childrenchanges considerably over the rst year of life. 22-25In hospitalized children, the 50th percentile for respiratory ratedecreased from 41 at 0 to 3 months ofage to 31 at 12 to 18 months of age. 26 Counting respiratory rate over thecourse of 1 minute is more accuratethan shorter observations. 27The pres- ence of a normal respiratory rate suggests that risk of signi cant viral or bacterial lower respiratory tract infection or pneumonia in an infant islow (negative likelihood ratio approxi- mately 0.5), 27-29but the presence of tachypnea does not distinguish be- tween viral and bacterial disease.30,31 The evidence relating the presence of speci cndings in the assessment of bronchiolitis to clinical outcomes is limited. Most studies addressing thisissue have enrolled children when presenting to hospital settings, in- cluding a large, prospective, multicen-ter study that assessed a variety ofoutcomes from the emergency de- partment (ED) and varied inpatient settings. 18,32,33 Severe adverse events, such as ICU admission and need formechanical ventilation, are uncommonamong children with bronchiolitis and limit the power of these studies to detect clinically important risk fac-tors associated with disease pro-gression. 16,34,35 Tachypnea, de ned as a respiratory rate 70 per minute, has been associated with increased risk ofsevere disease in some studies 35-37but not others.38Many scoring systems have been developed in an attempt toobjectively quantify respiratory dis-tress, although none has achievedwidespread acceptance and few have demonstrated any predictive validity, likely because of the substantial tem-poral variability in physical ndings in infants with bronchiolitis. 39 Pulse oximetry has been rapidly adopted into clinical assessment of children with bronchiolitis on the basis of datasuggesting that it reliably detects hyp-oxemia not suspected on physical examination 36,40; however, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of pulse oximetry to predict clinical out- comes. Among inpatients, perceived need for supplemental oxygen on thebasis of pulse oximetry has been as- sociated with prolonged hospitaliza- tion, ICU admission, and mechanicalventilation. 16,34,41 Among outpatients, available evidence differs on whether mild reductions in pulse oximetry (< 95% on room air) predict progression of disease or need for a return obser- vational visit.38 Apnea has been reported to occur with a wide range of prevalence estimates and viral etiologies.42,43 Retrospective, hospital-based studies have included a high proportion of infants with risk factors, such as prematurity or neuro- muscular disease, that may have biasedthe prevalence estimates. One largestudy found no apnea events for infants assessed as low risk by using several risk factors: age >1 month for full-term infants or 48 weeks 'postconceptional age for preterm infants, and absenceof any previous apneic event at pre-sentation to the hospital. 44Another large multicenter study found no asso-ciation between the speci c viral agent and risk of apnea in bronchiolitis. 42 The literature on viral testing for bron- chiolitis has expanded in recent years with the availability of sensitive poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Large studies of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis have consistently foundthat 60% to 75% have positive test results for RSV, and have noted coinfections in up to one-third of infants. 32,33,45 In the event an infant receiving monthly prophylaxis is hospitalized with bronchiolitis, testing should be performed to determine if RSV is the etiologic agent. If a breakthrough RSV infection is determined to be presentbased on antigen detection or other PEDIATRICS Volume 134, Number 5, November 2014 e1479FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS at Stony Brook University on October 29, 2014 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from assay, monthly palivizumab prophylaxis should be discontinued because of thevery low likelihood of a second RSVinfection in the same year. Apart fromthis setting, routine virologic testing isnot recommended. Infants with non-RSV bronchiolitis, in particular human rhinovirus, appear to have a shorter courses and may rep-resent a different phenotype associatedwith repeated wheezing. 32PCR assay results should be interpreted cautiously,given that the assay may detect pro-longed viral shedding from an unrelatedprevious illness, particularly with rhi- novirus. In contrast, RSV detected by PCR assay almost always is associatedwith disease. At the individual patientlevel, the value of identifying a spe-cic viral etiology causing bronchi- olitis has not been demonstrated. 33 Current evidence does not support routine chest radiography in children with bronchiolitis. Although manyinfants on radiography correlates withdisease severity. Atelectasis on chestradiography was associated with in-creased risk of severe disease in 1outpatient study. 16Further studies, in- cluding 1 randomized trial, suggestchildren with suspected lower respi-ratory tract infection who had radiog-raphy performed were more likely toreceive antibiotics without any differ-ence in outcomes. 46,47Initial radiography should be reserved for cases in whichrespiratory effort is severe enough towarrant ICU admission or where signs of an airway complication (such as pneumothorax) are present. TREATMENT ALBUTEROL Key Action Statement 2 Clinicians should not administer albuterol (or salbutamol) to infantsand children with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis (Evidence Quality: B; Recommendation Strength: StrongRecommendation). Action Statement Pro le KAS 2 Although several studies and reviews have evaluated the use of bronchodi- lator medications for viral bronchiolitis, most randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent ben- etf r o m -o r -adrenergic agents. Several meta-analyses and systematicreviews 48-53have shown that broncho- dilators may improve clinical symptomscores, but they do not affect disease resolution, need for hospitalization, orlength of stay (LOS). Because clinical scores may vary from one observer to the next 39,54 and do not correlate with more objective measures, such as pul-monary function tests, 55clinical scores are not validated measures of the ef - cacy of bronchodilators. Although tran- sient improvements in clinical score have been observed, most infantstreated with bronchodilators will not bene t from their use.A recently updated Cochrane system-atic review assessing the impact of bronchodilators on oxygen saturation,the primary outcome measure, reported 30 randomized controlled trials in- volving 1992 infants in 12 countries. 56 Some studies included in this reviewevaluated agents other than albuterol/salbutamol (eg, ipratropium and meta- proterenol) but did not include epi- nephrine. Small sample sizes, lack of standardized methods for outcome evaluation (eg, timing of assessments), and lack of standardized intervention (various bronchodilators, drug dosages,routes of administration, and nebuliza- tion delivery systems) limit the in- terpretation of these studies. Because of variable study designs as well as the inclusion of infants who had a history ofprevious wheezing in some studies, there was considerable heterogeneity in the studies. Sensitivity analysis (ie, including only studies at low risk of bias) signi cantly reduced heterogene- ity measures for oximetry while having little effect on the overall effect size ofoximetry (mean difference [MD] -0.38, 95% con showing bene t 57-59 are methodologically weaker than other studies and include older children withrecurrent wheezing. Results of the Cochrane review indicated no bene ti n t h ec l i n i c a lc o u r s eo fi n f a n t sw i t hbronchiolitis who received bronchodi- lators. The potential adverse effects (tachycardia and tremors) and cost of these agents outweigh any potentialbenets. In the previous iteration of this guideline, a trial of -agonists was included as an option. However, given the greater strength of the evidence demonstrat- ing no bene t, and that there is no well-established way to determine an \"objective method of response\" to bronchodilators in bronchiolitis, this option has been removed.

Ifa clinical trial of bronchodilators isundertaken, clinicians should note that thevariability of the disease process, the host 's airway, and the clinical assessments, par-ticularly scoring, would limit the clinician' s ability to observe a clinically relevant re-sponse to bronchodilators. Chavasse et al 60reviewed the available literature on use of -agonists for chil- dren younger than 2 years with re- current wheezing. At the time of thatreview, there were 3 studies in theoutpatient setting, 2 in the ED, and 3in the pulmonary function laboratorysetting. This review concluded therewere no clear bene ts from the use of-agonists in this population. The authors noted some con flicting evi- dence, but further study was recom-mended only if the population could beclearly de ned and meaningful out- come measures could be identi ed. The population of children with bron- chiolitis studied in most trials of bronchodilators limits the ability tomake recommendations for all clinicalscenarios. Children with severe diseaseor with respiratory failure were gen-erally excluded from these trials, andthis evidence cannot be generalized tothese situations. Studies using pulmo-nary function tests show no effect ofalbuterol among infants hospitalizedwith bronchiolitis. 56,61 One study in a critical care setting showed a smalldecrease in inspiratory resistance af-ter albuterol in one group and leval-buterol in another group, but therapywas accompanied by clinically signi - cant tachycardia. 62This small clinical change occurring with signi cant ad- verse effects does not justify recom- mending albuterol for routine care.EPINEPHRINE Key Action Statement 3 Clinicians should not administer epinephrine to infants and children with a diagnosis of Quality: B; Recommenda- tion Strength: KAS 3 Epinephrine is an adrenergic agent with both -a n d -receptor agonist activity that has been used to treatupper and lower respiratory tract ill- nesses both as a systemic agent and directly into the respiratory tract, where it is typically administered as a nebulized solution. Nebulized epi- nephrine has been administered in the racemic form and as the puri ed L-enantiomer, which is commercially available in the United States for in- travenous use. Studies in other dis- eases, such as croup, have found no difference in ef cacy on the basis of preparation, 63although the compari- son has not been speci cally studied for bronchiolitis. Most studies havecompared L-epinephrine or albuterol. Cochrane meta-analysis by Hartling et al 64systemati- cally evaluated the evidence on thistopic and found no evidence for utilityin the inpatient setting. Two large, multicenter to pla- cebo albuterol66in the hospital setting found no improvement in LOSor other inpatient outcomes. A recent, large multicenter trial found a similar lack of ef cacy compared with pla- cebo and further demonstrated lon-ger LOS when epinephrine was used on a xed schedule compared with an as-needed schedule. 67This evidence suggests epinephrine should not beused in children hospitalized for bron- chiolitis, except potentially as a rescue agent in severe disease, although for- mal study is needed before a recom- mendation for the use of epinephrine in this setting. The role of epinephrine in the out- patient setting remains controver- sial. A major addition to the evidence base came from the Canadian Bron- chiolitis Epinephrine Steroid Trial. 68 This multicenter randomized trial enrolled 800 patients with bron- chiolitis from 8 EDs and compared hospitalization rates over a 7-day period. This study had 4 and neb- ulized placebo plus oral placebo.

HYPERTONIC SALINE Key Action Statement 4a Nebulized hypertonic saline should not be administered to infants with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis in the emergency department (EvidenceQuality: B; Recommendation Strength: Moderate Recommendation).

There were 6 studies involving 500 inpatients providing datafor the analysis of LOS with an aggregate 1-day decrease reported, a result largely driven by the inclusion of 3 studies withrelatively long mean length of stay of 5 to 6 days. The analysis of effect on clinical scores included 7 studies involving 640 patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings and demonstrated incremental positive effect with each day posttreat- ment from day 1 to day 3 ( -0.88 MD on day 1, -1.32 MD on day 2, and -1.51 MD on day 3). Finally, Zhang et al 73found no effect on hospitalization rates in thepooled analysis of 1 outpatient and 3 EDstudies including 380 total patients. Several randomized trials published after the Cochrane review period further in- formed the current guideline recommen-dation. Four trials evaluated admissionrates from the ED, 3 ratesfrom the ED favoring hypertonic saline,although the other 4 studies were con-cordant with the studies included in theCochrane review. However, contrary to the studies included in the Cochrane review, none of the more recent trials reportedimprovement in LOS and, when added tothe older studies for an updated meta-analysis, they signi cantly attenuate the summary estimate of the effect on LOS. 76,77 Most of the trials included in the Cochranereview occurred in settings with typicalLOS of more than 3 days in their usualcare arms. Hence, the signi cant decrease in LOS noted by Zhang et al 73may not be generalizable to the United States wherethe average LOS is 2.4 days. 10One other ongoing clinical trial performed in theUnited States, unpublished except in ab-stract form, further supports the obser-vation that hypertonic saline does not decrease LOS in settings where expected stays are less than 3 days. 78 The preponderance of the evidence sug- gests that 3% saline is safe and effective atimproving symptoms of mild to moderate bronchiolitis after 24 hours of use and reducing hospital LOS in settings in whichAggregate evidence qualityB Bene ts Avoiding adverse effects, such as wheezing and excesssecretions, cost Risk, harm, cost None Bene t-harm assessmentBene ts outweigh harms Value judgments NoneIntentional vaguenessNone Role of patient preferencesNone Exclusions NoneStrength Moderate recommendation Differences of opinionNoneAggregate evidence qualityB Bene ts May shorten hospital stay if LOS is>72 h Risk, harm, cost Adverse effects such as wheezing and excess secretions; cost Bene t-harm assessmentBene ts outweigh harms for longer hospital stays Value judgments Anticipating an individual child 's LOS is dif cult.

It has not been studied in intensive care settings, and most trials have included only patients with mild to moderate dis- ease. Most studies have used a 3% saline concentration, and most have combined it with bronchodilators with each dose; however, there is retrospective evidence that the rate of adverse events is similar withoutbronchodilators, 79as well as pro- spective evidence extrapolated from2 trials without bronchodilators. 79,80 A single study was performed in theambulatory outpatient setting 81; how- ever, future studies in the United Statesshould focus on sustained usage on the basis of pattern of effects dis- cerned in the available literature. CORTICOSTEROIDS Key Action Statement 5 Clinicians should not administer systemic corticosteroids to infants with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis in any setting (Evidence Quality: A; Recommendation Strength: Strong Recommendation). Action Statement Pro le KAS 5 Although there is good evidence of benet from corticosteroids in otherrespiratory diseases, such as asthma and croup,82-84the evidence on corti- costeroid use in bronchiolitis is nega- tive. The most recent Cochranesystematic review shows that cortico- steroids do not signi cantly reduce outpatient admissions when compared with placebo (pooled risk ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.08; and risk ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.06, respectively) anddo not reduce LOS for inpatients (MD -0.18 days; 95% CI -0.39 to 0.04). 85No other comparisons showed relevant differences for either primary or sec- ondary outcomes. This review con- tained 17 trials with 2596 participantsand included 2 large ED-based ran- domized trials, neither of which showed reductions in hospital admissions withtreatment with corticosteroids as com- pared with placebo. 69,86 One of these large trials, the Canadian Bronchiolitis Epinephrine Steroid Trial, however, did show a reduction in hos- pitalizations 7 days after treatment withcombined nebulized epinephrine and oral dexamethasone as compared with placebo. 69Although an unadjusted ana- lysis showed a relative risk for hospi- talization of 0.65 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.95; P= .02) for combination therapy as compared with placebo, adjustment for multiple comparison rendered the result insigni cant ( P= .07). These results have generated considerable controversy.87Although there is no standard recognized rationale for why combination epinephrine and dexa- methasone would be synergistic in infants with bronchiolitis, evidence inadults and children older than 6 years with asthma shows that adding inhaled long-acting agonists to moderate/high doses of inhaled cor- ticosteroids allows reduction of the corticosteroid dose by, on average,60%. 88Basic science studies focused on understanding the interaction be-tween agonists and corticosteroids have shown potential mechanisms forwhy simultaneous administration of these drugs could be synergistic. 89-92 However, other bronchiolitis trials ofcorticosteroids administered by bronchodila- tor regimens have not consistentlyshown bene t 93-97;h e n c e ,ar e c o m m e n - dation regarding the bene to fc o m - bined dexamethasone and epinephrinetherapy is premature. The systematic review of cortico- steroids in children with bronchiolitis cited previously did not nd any dif- ferences in short-term adverse eventsas compared with placebo. 86However, corticosteroid therapy may prolong viral shedding in patients with bron- chiolitis.17 In summary, a comprehensive sys-tematic review and large multicenter randomized trials provide clear evi- dence that corticosteroids alone do not provide signi cant bene tt o children with bronchiolitis. Evidencefor potential bene t of combined corticosteroid and agents with both -a n d -agonist activity is at best tentative, and additional large trialsare needed to clarify whether this therapy is effective. Further, although there is no evidence of short-term adverse effects fromcorticosteroid therapy, other than prolonged viral shedding, in infants and children with bronchiolitis, there is inadequate evidence to be certain of safety. OXYGEN Key Action Statement 6a Clinicians may choose not to ad- minister supplemental oxygen if the oxyhemoglobin saturation exceeds 90% in infants and children with adiagnosis bronchiolitis (Evidence Quality: D; Recommendation Strength: Weak Recommendation [based on reasoning from rst principles]).Aggregate evidence qualityA Bene ts No clinical bene t, avoiding effects Risk, harm, cost None Bene t-harm assessmentBene ts outweigh harms Value judgments patient preferencesNone Exclusions NoneStrength Strong recommendationDifferences of opinionNone PEDIATRICS Volume 134, Number 5, November 2014 e1483FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS at Stony Brook University on October 29, 2014 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from Action Statement Pro le KAS 6a Key Action Statement 6b Clinicians may choose not to use continuous pulse oximetry for in- fants and children with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis (Evidence Quality: C; Recommendation Strength: WeakRecommendation [based on lower- level evidence]). Action Statement Pro le KAS 6b Although oxygen saturation is a poor predictor of respiratory distress, it isassociated closely with a perceived need for hospitalization in infants with bronchiolitis. 98,99 Additionally, oxygen saturation has been implicated as a primary determinant of LOS in bronchiolitis.40,100,101 Physiologic data based on the oxyhe- moglobin dissociation curve (Fig 3) demonstrate that small increases in arterial partial pressure of oxygen areassociated with marked improvementin pulse oxygen saturation when the latter is less than 90%; with pulse oxy- gen saturation readings greater than90% it takes very large elevations in arterial partial pressure of oxygen to affect further increases. In infants andchildren with bronchiolitis, no data existto suggest such increases result in any clinically signi cant difference in physi- ologic function, patient symptoms, or clinical outcomes. Although it is well understood that acidosis, temperature, and 2,3-diphosphoglutarate in fluence the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, there has never been research to demonstrate how those in fluences practically affect infants with hypox- emia. The risk of hypoxemia must be weighed against the risk of hospitali- zation when making any decisionsabout site of care. One study of hospi- talized children with bronchiolitis, for example, noted a 10% adverse error ornear-miss rate for harm-causing inter-ventions. 103There are no studies on the effect of short-term, brief periods of hypoxemia such as may be seen inbronchiolitis. Transient hypoxemia is common in healthy infants. 104Travel of healthy children even to moderate alti- tudes of 1300 m results in transient sleep desaturation to an average of 84% with no known adverse con-sequences. 105Although children with chronic hypoxemia do incur devel- opmental and behavioral problems, children who suffer intermittent hyp-oxemia from diseases such as asthmado not have impaired intellectual abil- ities or behavioral disturbance. 106-108 Supplemental oxygen provided for in-fants not requiring additional re-spiratory support is best initiated withnasal prongs, although exact mea-surement of fraction of inspired oxy- gen is unreliable with this method. 109 Pulse oximetry is a convenient methodto assess the percentage of hemo- globin bound by oxygen in children.Pulse oximetry has been erroneouslyused in bronchiolitis as a proxy forrespiratory distress. Accuracy of pulseoximetry is poor, especially in the 76%to 90% range. 110Further, it has been well demonstrated that oxygen satu-ration has much less impact on re-spiratory drive than carbon dioxideconcentrations in the blood. 111There is very poor correlation between re- spiratory distress and oxygen satu- rations among infants with lowerrespiratory tract infections. 112Other than cyanosis, no published clinicalsign, model, or score accurately iden-ties hypoxemic children. 113 Among children admitted for bronchi-olitis, continuous pulse oximetry mea- surement is not well studied andpotentially problematic for children whodo not require oxygen. Transient desa-turation is a normal phenomenon inhealthy infants. In 1 study of 64 healthy infants between 2 weeks and 6 months of age, 60% of these infants exhibiteda transient oxygen desaturation below90%, to values as low as 83%. 105Ar e t - rospective study of the role of continu-ous measurement of oxygenation ininfants hospitalized with bronchiolitisfound that 1 in 4 patients incur unnec-essarily prolonged hospitalization asa result of a perceived need for oxygenoutside of other symptoms 40and no evidence of bene t was found.

Alarm fa- tigue is recognized by The JointCommission as a contributor toward in-hospital morbidity and mortality. 114 One adult study demonstrated verypoor documentation of hypoxemia al- erts by pulse oximetry, an indicator of alarm fatigue. 115Pulse oximetry probes can fall off easily, leading toinaccurate measurements and alarms. 116 False reliance on pulse oximetry may lead to less careful monitoring of re- spiratory status. In one study, contin- uous pulse oximetry was associated with increased risk of minor adverse events in infants admitted to a gen- eral ward.117 The pulse oximetry - monitored patients were found tohave less-effective surveillance of their severity of illness when controlling for other variables. There are a number of new approaches to oxygen delivery in bronchiolitis, 2 of which are home oxygen and high- frequency nasal cannula. There isemerging evidence for the role of home oxygen in reducing LOS or admission rate for infants with bronchiolitis, in-cluding 2 randomized trials. 118,119 Most of the studies have been performed inareas of higher altitude, where pro- longed hypoxemia is a prime deter- minant of LOS in the hospital. 120,121 Readmission rates may be moderatelyhigher in patients discharged with home oxygen; however, overall hospital use may be reduced, 122although not in all settings.123Concerns have been raised that home pulse oximetry maycomplicate care or confuse families. 124 Communication with follow-up physi-cians is important, because primary care physicians may have dif culty de- termining safe pulse oximetry levelsfor tionally, there may be an increaseddemand for follow-up outpatient visits associated with home oxygen use. 124 Use of humidi ed, heated, high- flow nasal cannula to deliver air-oxygenmixtures provides assistance to in- fants with bronchiolitis through mul- tiple proposed mechanisms. 126There flow nasal can- nula improves physiologic measuresof respiratory effort and can generatecontinuous positive airway pressure in bronchiolitis. 127-130Clinical evidence suggests it reduces work of breath- ing131,132 and may decrease need for intubation,133-136although studies are generally retrospective and small. The therapy has been studied in the ED136,137 and the general inpatient setting,134,138 as well as the ICU. The largest and most rigorous retrospective study to date was from Australia,138which showed a decline in intubation rate in the sub-group of infants with bronchiolitis ( 330) from 37% duction of high- flow nasal cannula, while the national registry intubationrate remained at 28%. A single pilot for a randomized trial has been pub- lished to date. 139Although promising, the absence of any completed ran-domized trial of the ef cacy of high- flow nasal cannula in bronchiolitis precludesspeci c recommendations on it use at present. Pneumothorax is a reported complication.

Although lobar at- electasis is not characteristic of this disease, chest radiographs may show evidence of subsegmental atelectasis, prompting clinicians to consider or- dering chest physiotherapy to promote airway clearance. A Cochrane Review140 found 9 randomized controlled trialsthat evaluated chest physiotherapy inhospitalized patients with bronchiolitis. No clinical bene t was found by using vibration or percussion (5 trials) 141-144 or passive expiratory techniques (4 tri- als).145-148Since that review, a study149 of the passive expiratory techniquefound a small, but signi cant reduction in duration of oxygen therapy, but noother bene ts. Suctioning of the nasopharynx to re- move secretions is a frequent practice in infants with bronchiolitis. Although suctioning the nares may provide temporary relief of nasal congestionor upper airway obstruction, a retro- spective study reported that deep suctioning 150 was associated with longer LOS in hospitalized infants 2to 12 months of age. The same study also noted that lapses of greater than 4 hours in noninvasive, external nasal suctioning were also associ- ated with longer LOS. Currently, there are insuf cient data to make a rec- ommendation about suctioning, but it appears that routine use of \"deep \" suctioning 151,153 may not be bene cial. ANTIBACTERIALS Key Action Statement 8 Clinicians should not administer antibacterial medications to infants and children with a diagnosis ofbronchiolitis unless there is a con- comitant bacterial infection, or a strong suspicion of one. (EvidenceQuality: B; Recommendation Strength: Strong Recommendation). Action Statement Pro le KAS 8 Infants with bronchiolitis frequently re- ceive antibacterial therapy because of fever, 152young age,153and concern for secondary bacterial infection.154Early randomized controlled trials155,156 showed no bene t from routine anti- bacterial therapy for children with bronchiolitis. Nonetheless, antibiotictherapy continues to be overused in young infants with bronchiolitis because of concern for an undetected bacterial infection. Studies have shown that febrile infants without an identi able source of fever have a risk of bacteremia that maybe as high as 7%. However, a child with a distinct viral syndrome, such as bronchiolitis, has a lower risk (muchless than 1%) of bacterial infection of the cerebrospinal fluid or blood. 157 Ralston et al158conducted a systematic review of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) occurring in hospitalized febrileinfants between 30 and 90 days of age with bronchiolitis. Instances of bacter- emia or meningitis were extremely rare.Enteritis was not evaluated. Urinary tract infection occurred at a rate of approxi- mately 1%, but asymptomatic bacteri-uria may have explained this nding. The authors concluded routine screening forSBI among hospitalized febrile infantswith bronchiolitis between 30 and 90days of age is not justi ed. Limited data suggest the risk of bacterial infection inhospitalized infants with bronchiolitisyounger than 30 days of age is similar to the risk in older infants. An abnormal white blood cell count is not useful forpredicting a concurrent SBI in infants and young children hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infection. 159Sev- eral retrospective studies support thisconclusion. 160-166Four prospective stud- ies SBI in patients infections also demonstratedlow rates of SBI. 167-171 of hospitalized in- fants with bronchiolitis have radio- graphic evidence of atelectasis, and it may be dif cult to distinguish between atelectasis and bacterial in ltrate or consolidation.169Bacterial pneumonia in infants with bronchiolitis without consolidation is unusual.170Antibiotic therapy may be justi ed in some chil- dren with bronchiolitis who require intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.172,173 Although acute otitis media (AOM) in infants with bronchiolitis may be at- tributable to viruses, clinical featuresgenerally do not permit differentiation of viral AOM from those with a bacterial component. 174Two studies address the frequency of AOM in patients with bronchiolitis. Andrade et al175 pro- spectively identi ed AOM 42 patients who presented with bronchi- olitis. AOM was present in 50% on entry to the study and developed in an addi- tional 12% within 10 days.

AOM did not in fluence the clinical course or laboratory ndings of bronchiolitis. The current AAP guideline on AOM177rec- ommends that a diagnosis of AOM should include bulging of the tympanic membrane. This is based on bulging being the best indicator for the pres- ence of bacteria in multiple tympano- centesis studies and on 2 articles comparing antibiotic to placebo ther- apy that used a bulging tympanic membrane as a necessary part of the diagnosis.178,179 New studies are needed to determine the incidence of AOM in bronchiolitis by using the new criterion of bulging of the tympanic membrane. Refer to the AOM guideline180for rec- ommendations regarding the manage-ment of AOM. NUTRITION AND HYDRATION Key Action Statement 9 Clinicians should administer naso- gastric or intravenous fluids for infants with a diagnosis of bron-chiolitis who cannot maintain hy- dration orally (Evidence Quality: X; Recommendation Strength: Strong Recommendation). Action Statement Pro le KAS 9 The level of respiratory distress attributable to bronchiolitis guides the indications for fluid replacement. Conversely, food intake in the previous 24 hours may be a predictor of oxygen saturation among infants with bron-chiolitis. One study found that food in- take at less than 50% of normal for the previous 24 hours is associated witha pulse oximetry value of <95%. 180 Infants with mild respiratory distressmay require only observation, particu- larly if feeding remains unaffected. When the respiratory rate exceeds 60 to 70 breaths per minute, feeding may be compromised, particularly if nasal secretions are copious. There is limited evidence to suggest coordination of breathing with swallowing may be impaired among infants with bron-chiolitis. 181These infants may develop increased nasal flaring, retractions, and prolonged expiratory wheezing when fed and may be at increased risk of aspiration.182 One study estimated that one-third of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis require fluid replacement.183 One case series184 examined the tive the in- travenous and nasogastric routes forfluid replacement. A pilot trial in Israel that included 51 infants younger than 6 months demon- strated no signi cant differences in the duration of oxygen needed ortime to full oral feeds between infants receiving intravenous 5% dextrose in normal saline solution or nasogastric breast milk or for-mula. 187Infants in the intravenous group had a shorter LOS (100 vs 120hours) but it was not statisticallysigni cant. In a larger open ran- domized trial including infants be-tween 2 and 12 months of age andconducted in Australia and New Zealand, there were no signi cant differences in rates of admission toICUs, need for ventilatory support, and adverse events between 381 infants assigned to nasogastric hy- dration and 378 infants assigned to intravenous hydration. 188There was a difference of 4 hours in mean LOSbetween the intravenous group (82.2 hours) and the nasogastric group(86.2 hours) that was not statisti- cally signi cant. The nasogastric route had a higher success rate ofinsertion than the intravenous route. Parental satisfaction scores did not differ between the in- travenous and nasogastric groups. These studies suggest that infants who have dif culty feeding safely because of respiratory distress can receive either intravenous or naso- gastric fluid replacement; however, more evidence is needed to increasethe strength of this recommendation. The possibility of fluid retention re- lated to production of antidiuretic hormone has been raised in patients with bronchiolitis. 187-189 Therefore, receipt of hypotonic fluid replace- ment and maintenance fluids may increase the risk of iatrogenic hypo-natremia in these infants. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that among hospitalized children requiring main- tenance fluids, the use of hypotonic fluids was associated with signi cant hyponatremia compared with iso-tonic fluids in older children. 190Use of isotonic fluids, in general, appears to be safer.

If a child meets these cri- teria and is in the rst 24 months of life and continues to require sup-plemental oxygen, diuretic therapy, or chronic corticosteroid therapy within 6 months of the start of the RSV season, monthly prophylaxis should be administered for the remainder ofthe season. NUMBER OF DOSES Community outbreaks of RSV diseaseusually begin in November or December, peak in January or February, and end by late March or, at times, in April. 4Figure 1 shows the 2011 -2012 bronchiolitis sea- son, which is typical of most years.Because 5 monthly doses will provide more than 24 weeks of protective se- rum palivizumab concentration, admin- istration of more than 5 monthly doses is not recommended within the conti- nental United States. For infants who qualify for 5 monthly doses, initiation of prophylaxis in November and continua-tion for a total of 5 doses will provideprotection into April. 201If prophylaxis is initiated in October, the fth and nal dose should be administered in Febru-ary, and protection will last into March for most children. SECOND YEAR OF LIFE Because of the low risk of RSV hospi- talization in the second year of life, palivizumab prophylaxis is not recom- mended for children in the second year of life with the following exception. Children who satisfy the de nition of chronic lung disease of infancy and continue to require supplemental oxy- gen, chronic corticosteroid therapy, or diuretic therapy within 6 months of the onset of the second RSV sea- son may be considered for a second season of prophylaxis. OTHER CONDITIONS Insuf cient data are available to rec- ommend routine use of prophylaxis in children with Down syndrome, cystic brosis, pulmonary abnormality, neu- romuscular disease, or immune com- promise. Down Syndrome Routine use of prophylaxis for children in the rst year of life with Down syndrome is not recommended unlessthe child quali es because of cardiac disease or prematurity. 202 Cystic Fibrosis Routine use of palivizumab prophylaxis in patients with cystic brosis is not recommended.203,204 Available studies indicate the incidence of RSV hospital- i z a t i o ni nc h i l d r e nw i t hc y s t i c brosis is low and unlikely to be different fromchildren without cystic brosis. No patients withcystic brosis. A randomized clinical trial involving 186 children with cysticbrosis from 40 centers reported 1 subject in each group was hospitalized because of RSV infection. Although thisstudy was not powered for ef cacy, no clinically meaningful differences inoutcome were reported. 205As u r v e yo f cystic brosis center directors pub- lished in 2009 noted that palivizumab prophylaxis is not the standard of care for patients with cystic brosis.206If a neonate is diagnosed with cystic - brosis newborn screening, RSV prophylaxis should not be adminis- tered if no other indications are pres-ent. A patient with cystic brosis with clinical evidence of chronic lung dis-ease in the rst year of life may be considered for prophylaxis. Neuromuscular Disease and Pulmonary Abnormality The risk of RSV hospitalization is not well de n e di nc h i l d r e nw i t hp u l m o n a r y abnormalities or neuromuscular dis- ease that impairs ability to clear secretions from the lower airway be- cause of ineffective cough, recurrent gastroesophageal tract re flux, pulmo- nary malformations, tracheoesophagealstula, upper airway conditions, or conditions requiring tracheostomy. Nodata on the relative risk of RSV hospi- talization are available for this cohort. Selected infants with disease or con-genital anomaly that impairs their ability to clear secretions from the lower airway because of ineffective cough may be considered for pro- phylaxis during the rst year of life. Immunocompromised Children Population-based data are not avail- able on the incidence or severity of RSV hospitalization in children who un- dergo solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, receive chemotherapy, or are immunocom-promised because of other conditions. Prophylaxis may be considered for hematopoietic stem cell transplant PEDIATRICS Volume 134, Number 5, November 2014 e1489FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS at Stony Brook University on October 29, 2014 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from patients who undergo transplantation and are profoundly immunosup- pressed during the RSV season.207 MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Prophylaxis is not recommended for prevention of nosocomial RSV disease in the NICU or hospital setting.208,209 No evidence suggests palivizumab is a cost-effective measure to prevent recurrent wheezing in children. Pro- phylaxis should not be administered to reduce recurrent wheezing in later years.210,211 Monthly prophylaxis in Alaska Native children who qualify should be de- termined by locally generated data regarding season onset and end. Continuation of monthly prophylaxis for an infant or young child who ex- periences breakthrough RSV hospital- ization is not recommended. HAND HYGIENE Key Action Statement 11a All people should disinfect hands before and after direct contact with patients, after contact with inanimate objects in the direct vi- cinity of the patient, and after re- moving gloves (Evidence Quality: B; Recommendation Strength: Strong Recommendation). Action Statement Pro le KAS 11aKey Action Statement 11b All people should use alcohol-based rubs for hand decontamination when caring for children with bronchioli- tis. When alcohol-based rubs are not available, individuals should wash their hands with soap and water (Evidence Quality: B; Recom- mendation Strength: Strong Rec-ommendation). Action Statement Pro le KAS 11b Efforts should be made to decrease the spread of RSV and other causative agents of bronchiolitis in medical settings, especially in the hospital. Secretions from infected patients can be found on beds, crib railings, ta- bletops, and toys. 12RSV, as well as many other viruses, can survive better on hard surfaces than on porous surfaces or hands. It can remain in- fectious on counter tops for 6 hours, on gowns or paper tissues for 20 to 30 minutes, and on skin for up to 20 minutes.212 It has been shown that RSV can be carried and spread to others on the hands ofcaregivers.213Studies have shown that health care workers have acquired in-fection by performing activities such asfeeding, diaper change, and playing with the RSV-infected infant. Caregivers who had contact only with surfaces contaminated with the infants' secre- tions or touched inanimate objects in patients 'r o o m sa l s oa c q u i r e dR S V .I n these studies, health care workers contaminated their hands (or gloves) with RSV and inoculated their oral or conjunctival mucosa. 214Frequent hand washing by health care workers has been shown to reduce the spread of RSV in the health care setting.215 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an extensive re- view of the hand-hygiene literature and made recommendations as to indica-tions for hand washing and hand antisepsis. 216 Among the recom- mendations are that hands should be disinfected before and after direct contact with every patient, after con- tact with inanimate objects in the di-rect vicinity of the patient, and before putting on and after removing gloves. If hands are not visibly soiled, analcohol-based rub is preferred. In guidelines published in 2009, the World Health Organization also rec-ommended alcohol-based hand-rubs as the standard for hand hygiene in health care. 217Speci cally, systematic reviews show them to remove organ- isms more effectively, require less time, and irritate skin less often thanhand washing with soap or other anti- septic agents and water. The availability of bedside alcohol-based solutions in-creased compliance with hand hygiene among health care workers. 214 When caring for hospitalized children with clinically diagnosed bronchioli- tis, strict adherence to hand de- contamination and use of personal protective equipment (ie, gloves andgowns) can reduce the risk of cross- infection in the health care setting. 215Aggregate evidence quality B Bene ts Decreased transmission of disease Risk, harm, cost Possible hand irritation Bene t-harm assessment Bene ts outweigh harms Value judgments None Intentional vagueness None Role of patient preferences NoneExclusions None Strength Strong recommendation Differences of opinion NoneAggregate evidence quality B Bene ts Less hand irritation Risk, harm, cost If there is visible dirt on the hands, hand washing isnecessary; alcohol-based rubs are noteffective forClostridium difcile, present are hazard, and have a slight increased cost Bene t-harm assessment Bene ts outweigh harms Value judgments None Intentional vagueness None Role of patient preferences NoneExclusions NoneStrength Strong recommendation Differences of opinion None e1490 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS at Stony Brook University on October 29, 2014 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from Other methods of infection control in viral bronchiolitis include education of personnel and family members, surveil-lance for the onset of RSV season, and wearing masks when anticipating expo- sure to aerosolized secretions while performing patient care activities. Pro- grams that implement the aforemen- tioned principles, in conjunction with effective hand decontamination and cohorting of patients, have been shown to reduce the spread of RSV in the health care setting by 39% to 50%. 218,219 TOBACCO SMOKE Key Action Statement 12a Clinicians should inquire about the exposure of the infant or child to tobacco smoke when assessing infants and children for bron- chiolitis (Evidence Quality: C; Rec- ommendation Strength: Moderate Recommendation). Statement Pro le KAS 12a Key Action Statement 12b Clinicians should counsel care- givers about exposing the infant orchild to environmental tobaccosmoke and smoking cessation when assessing a child for bron-chiolitis (Evidence Quality: B; Rec- ommendation Strength: Strong Recommendation). Action Statement Pro le KAS 12b Tobacco smoke exposure increases the risk and severity of bronchiolitis. Stra- chan and Cook 220rst delineated the effects of environmental tobacco smoke on rates of lower respiratory tract dis- ease in infants in a meta-analysis in- cluding 40 studies. In a more recent systematic review, Jones et al221found a pooled odds ratio of 2.51 (95% CI 1.96to 3.21) for tobacco smoke exposure and bronchiolitis hospitalization among the 7 studies speci c to the condition. Other investigators have consistently reported tobacco smoke exposure increases both severity of illness and risk of hospitalization for bronchioli-tis. 222- 225The AAP issued a technical report on the risks of secondhandsmoke in 2009. The report makes rec-ommendations regarding effective ways to eliminate or reduce secondhand smoke exposure, including education of parents. 226 Despite our knowledge of this impor- tant risk factor, there is evidence to suggest health care providers identify fewer than half of children exposed to tobacco smoke in the outpatient, in- patient, or ED settings.227-229Further- more, there is evidence thatcounseling parents in these settings is well received and has a measurable impact. Rosen et al 230performed a meta-analysis of the effects of inter-ventions in pediatric settings on pa-rental cessation and found a pooled risk ratio of 1.3 for cessation among the 18 studies reviewed. In contrast to many of the other recommendations, protecting chil- dren from tobacco exposure is a recommendation that is primarily implemented outside of the clinical setting. As such, it is critical that parents are fully educated about the importance of not allowing smoking in the home and that smoke lingers on clothes and in the environment for prolonged periods. 231It should be provided in plain language and in a respectful, culturally effective manner that is family centered, en- gages parents as partners in their child 's health, and factors in their literacy, health literacy, and primarylanguage needs. BREASTFEEDING Key Action Statement 13 Clinicians should encourage exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months to decrease the morbidity of respi- ratory infections (Evidence Quality: Grade B; Recommendation Strength: Moderate Recommendation).Aggregate evidence quality C Bene ts Can identify infants and children atrisk whose family may benet from counseling, predicting risk of severe disease Risk, harm, cost Time to inquireBene t-harm assessment Bene ts outweigh harms Value judgments NoneIntentional vagueness NoneRole of patient preferences Parent may choose to deny tobaccouse even thoughthey are, in fact, users Exclusions None Strength Moderate recommendation Differences of opinion NoneAggregate evidence quality BBene ts Reinforces the detrimentaleffects of smoking, potential todecrease smoking Risk, harm, cost Time to counsel Bene t-harm assessment Bene ts outweigh harms Value judgments NoneIntentional vagueness NoneRole of patient preferences Parents may choose to ignore counseling Exclusions None Strength Moderate recommendation Differences of opinion NoneNotes Counseling for tobacco smoke prevention should begin inthe prenatalperiod and continue in family-centeredcare and at all well-infant visits PEDIATRICS Volume 134, Number 5, November 2014 e1491FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS at Stony Brook University on October 29, 2014 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from Action Statement Pro le KAS 13 In 2012, the AAP presented a general policy on breastfeeding.232The policy statement was based on the provenbenets of breastfeeding for at least 6 months. Respiratory infections wereshown to be signi cantly less common in breastfed children. A primary re-source was a meta-analysis from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that showed an overall 72%reduction in the risk of hospitalization secondary to respiratory diseases in infants who were exclusively breastfed for 4 or more months compared with those who were formula fed. 233 The clinical evidence also supports decreased incidence and severity of illness in breastfed infants with bron- chiolitis. Dornelles et al234concluded that the duration of exclusive breast-feeding was inversely related to the length of oxygen use and the length of hospital stay in previously healthy infants with acute bronchiolitis. Ina large prospective study in Australia, Oddy et al 235showed that breastfeeding for less than 6 months was associatedwith an increased risk for 2 or moremedical visits and hospital admission for wheezing lower respiratory illness.In Japan, Nishimura et al 236looked at 3 groups of RSV-positive infantsdened as full, partial, or token breast- feeding. There were no signi cant differences in the hospitalization rate among the 3 groups; however, there were signi cant differences in the duration of hospitalization and therate of requiring oxygen therapy, both favoring breastfeeding. FAMILY EDUCATION Key Action Statement 14 Clinicians and nurses should edu- cate personnel and family mem- bers on evidence-based diagnosis, studies; Recommen-dation Pro le KAS 14Shared decision-making with parents about diagnosis and treatment of bronchiolitis is a key tenet of patient-centered care. Despite the absence of effective therapies for viral bronchi- olitis, caregiver education by clinicians may have a signi cant impact on care patterns in the disease. Children withbronchiolitis typically suffer from symptoms for 2 to 3 weeks, and parents often seek care in multiple settings during that time period. 237 Given that children with RSV gener-ally shed virus for 1 to 2 weeks andfrom 30% to 70% of family members may become ill, 238,239 education about prevention of transmission of diseaseis key. Restriction of visitors to new- borns during the respiratory virus season should be considered. Con- sistent evidence suggests that pa- rental education is helpful in the promotion of judicious use of anti-biotics and that clinicians may mis- interpret parental expectations about therapy unless the subject is openly discussed. 240- 242 FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS /C15Better algorithms for predicting the course of illness /C15Impact of clinical score on patient outcomes /C15Evaluating different ethnic groups and varying response to treat- ments /C15Does epinephrine alone reduce ad- mission in outpatient /C15Additional studies on epinephrine in combination with other corticosteroids /C15Hypertonic saline studies in theoutpatient setting and in in with shorter LOS /C15More studies on B Bene ts of bronchiolitisand other illnesses; multiple bene ts of breastfeeding cost ts outweigh risks Value judgments NoneIntentional vagueness NoneRole of patient preferences Parents may choose to feed formularather thanbreastfeed Exclusions NoneStrength Moderate recommendation Notes Education on breastfeedingshould begin inthe prenatalperiod Aggregate evidence quality C Bene ts Decreased transmission of disease, bene ts of breastfeeding, promotion of judicious use ofantibiotics, risksof infant lung damage attributable totobacco smoke Risk, harm, cost Time to educate properly Bene t-harm assessment Bene ts outweigh harms speci cally dened but should includeall people whoenter a patient 's room Role of patient preferences NoneExclusions NoneStrength Moderate recommendation Differences of opinion None e1492 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS at Stony Brook University on October 29, 2014 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from /C15Incidence of true AOM in bron- chiolitis by using 2013 guideline denition /C15More studies on deep suction-ing and nasopharyngeal suction- ing /C15Strategies for monitoring oxygen saturation /C15Use of home oxygen /C15Appropriate cutoff for use of oxy- gen in high altitude /C15Oxygen delivered by high- flow na- sal cannula /C15RSV vaccine and antiviral agents /C15Use of palivizumab in special populations, such as cystic b- rosis, neuromuscular diseases,Down syndrome, immune de - ciency /C15Emphasis on parent satisfaction/patient-centered outcomes in all research (ie, not LOS as the only measure)SUBCOMMITTEE ON BRONCHIOLITIS (OVERSIGHT BY THE COUNCIL ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND PATIENT SAFETY, 2013 -2014) Shawn L.
