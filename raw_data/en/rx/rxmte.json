Corresponding author: Dr Marie Yap Address: Bld 17, 18 Innovation Walk, 1 of 49 Abstract Purpose of the research: Burgeoning evidence that modifiable parental factors can influence children's and adolescents' risk for depression and anxiety indicates that parents can play a crucial role in prevention of these disorders in their children. However, it remains unclear whether preventive interventions that are directed primarily at the parent (i.e. where the parent receives more than half of the intervention) are effective in reducing child internalizing (including both depression and anxiety) problems in the longer term. Principal results: Compared to a range of comparison conditions, parenting interventions reduced child internalizing problems, at a minimum of six months after the intervention was delivered. Mean effects were very small for measures of internalizing and depressive symptoms, and small for measures of anxiety symptoms. Pooled effects for anxiety diagnoses were significant and indicated a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. Pooled effects for depression diagnoses approached significance but suggested a NNT of 11. These results were based on effects reported at the longest follow -up interval for each included study, which ranged from six months up to 15 years for internalizing measures, 5.5 years for depressive measures, and 11 years for anxiety measures. Major conclusions: Our findings underscore the likely benefits of increasing parental involvement in preventing internalizing problems, particularly anxiety problems, in young people. Keywords: Mental disorders; emotional problems; family; systematic review; young people Page 2 of 49 Introduction Mental disorders are the largest contributors to disability in young people, with one in four youths affected during their lifetime (Patel, Flisher, Hetrick, & McGorry, 2007). Anxiety and mood disorders are amongst the most common disorders, with lifetime prevalence rates of 38% and 18% respectively amongst young people aged 13-17 years (Kessler, Petukhova, Sampson, Zaslavsky, & Wittchen, 2012). Given the deleterious long- term sequelae resulting from early onset disorders (Last et al., 1997; Rao et al., 1995), there is a strong impetus for an effective, integrated approach to prevent these disorders in young people. There is substantial overlap between depression and anxiety symptoms especially in childhood (Hankin, Fraley , Lahey, & Waldman, 2005; Lahey, Hulle, D'Onofrio, Rodgers, & Waldman, 2008), and increasing evidence indicates that anxiety and depression comprise an 'internalizing cluster' (Schleider & Weisz, 2016; Weersing, Rozenman, Campo, 2012). In addition to their phenomenological and diagnostic similarities, depression and anxiety disorders share some risk factors, including parental factors (Dozois, Seeds, & Collins, 2009; Schleider & Weisz, 2016; Wilamowska et al., 2010). Of note, extant evidence indicates that many parental factors examined in depression and anxiety research are not specific to either disorder (e.g., B\u00f6gels & Brechman increasing number of researchers have called for transdiagnostic approaches to prevention of these disorders (Dozois et 2015; Yap et al., 2014), because of their potential to enhance the efficacy, generalizability, and cost-effectiveness of such interventions, as well as to facilitate their implementation. Moreover, studies examining internalizing outcomes across childhood and adolescence tend to use a range of measures assessing anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, or a combination of both, otherwise termed 'internalizing' symptoms. Hence, this review takes a transdiagnostic approach by including both depression and anxiety as outcomes of interest, along with measures of internalizing symptoms. Henceforth, the Page 3 of 49 broad term 'internalizing cluster or problems' will be used to refer to measures of internalizing, anxiety or depressive symptoms or disorders. Parental influence in the etiology of child internalizing problems Within the developmental psychopathological framework, interpersonal theories posit that psychopathology both results from, and contributes to, disruptions in developmentally -salient interpersonal processes (starting with early parent -infant attachment), which in turn interfere with young people's need for relatedness (Rudolph, Lansford, & Rodkin, 2016). From an etiological perspective, parents clearly have an important influence on young people's risk for internalizing disorders, in terms of both nature and nurture. Evidence from genetic studies suggests that the heritability of liability to internalizing disorders ranges from Boomsma, Van Beijsterveldt, al., 2003). In contrast, meta -analytic reviews have found that single parenting behaviors account for only small amounts of variance in child internalizing problems (between 1% to 18%; McLeod, & Yap & Jorm, 2015; Yap et al., 2014). Nonetheless, based on a large twin study in the Netherlands, Boomsma and colleagues (2005) concluded that as children grow up, the variation in internalizing problems is due in equal parts to genetic and environmental (namely the shared family environment) influences, and may partly account for the findings that some family -based approaches for child internalizing problems are effective. Furthermore, from a prevention and intervention perspective (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994; O'Connell, Boat, & Warner, 2009), the focus needs to be on modifiable factors that can be targeted in intervention. Involving parents in prevention Given the burgeoning evidence underscoring a range of modifiable parental factors that can increase or decrease the risk for depression and anxiety in children (Yap & Jorm, 2015) and adolescents (Yap et al., 2014), it is clear that parents play a crucial role in prevention of these disorders in their children. To that end, in the past several decades, parenting programs have been developed to capitalise on parents' influence on their child's development and mental health, based on the Page 4 of 49 underlying assumption that changing parenting (mediators) will in turn change a child's risk for depression and anxiety (Sandler, Schoenfelder, Wolchik, & MacKinnon, 2011). Specifically, one of the theoretical pathways proposed by Sandler and colleagues (2011) posits that parenting programs can have long- term benefits for child outcomes through their effects on parenting skills, perceptions of parental efficacy, and reduction in barriers to effective parenting (e.g. parental psychopathology). These parental changes in turn lead to changes in their child (e.g. emotion regulation), and the transactions that their child has with their environment (e.g. peer relations). How long do preventive effects last? Inherent in the evaluation of preventive parenting programs for child internalizing problems, is whether they have long- term effects. That is: does the program prevent child internalizing problems in the long term, well after the intervention is over? The absence of evidence for long -term effects is one of the key limitations bemoaned in previous reviews of preventive programs (Barlow, Smailagic, Ferriter, Bennett, & Jones, 2010; Fisak, Richard, & Mann, 2011; Greenberg, Domitrovich, & Bumbarger, 2001; Merry et al., 2011), which have mostly observed effects lasting less than 2 years. Based on developmental theories, some researchers have argued that preventive parenting interventions could have long -lasting effects, and that in fact there might be sleeper effects that increase over time (Greenberg et al., 2001; Rapee, 2013). In particular, following Bell's (1968) seminal writings and Sameroff and Chandler's (1975) transactional model of development, developmental research ers have long recognised that children are not passive recipients of parenting, but actively evoke and respond to parental behaviours based on their early temperamental dispositions (Dwyer, Nicholson, & Battistutta, 2006), giving rise to dynamic interactiv e processes between parent and child over the course of the child's development (Sameroff, 2009). These bidirectional processes are likely to influence and build on one another to shape subsequent interactions and experiences, altering the child's developmental trajectory and their risk of internalizing problems (Yap, Allen, & Sheeber, 2007). Hence, it is possible that by intervening in these processes (e.g. by modifying parental risk or protective factors; Yap & Jorm, Page 5 of 49 2015; Yap et al., 2014), parenting interventions may also result in magnified effects on child internalizing outcomes over time; or at least produce effects that are sustained even after the intervention has ended. Investigation of the long -term effects of parenting programs tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is required to address the question of whether such interventions have lasting effects, and whether these effects vary with the duration of the follow -up interval (post -intervention). Factor s that may influence preventive effects Various program -level factors can influence the effects of preventive parenting programs, including: (1) at which stage of child development is the program delivered; (2) who the target population of parents is; (3) the focus of intervention in the program; and (4) whether the child receives direct intervention (in addition to what the parent receives). Does the timing of preventive intervention matter? When considering the effects of preventive programs, one question is whether there is an 'optimal time' to intervene with parents. Within the developmental psychopathology framework, different aspects of parenting are salient at different stages of the child's development (Rudolph et al., 2016). The emergence of internalizing symptoms and rates of onset of disorders also vary across childhood (Kessler et al., 2012), and inform the need for preventive intervention at different developmental stages. Consistent with this, existing parenting interventions vary widely in their timing of delivery, from pre -birth programs for expectant parents to programs for parents of adolescents. Classic attachment theory (Bowlby, 1971) underscores the importance of early caregiver- infant attachment for optimal child development. Base d on this, various programs target the very early days of 'parenthood', beginning during pregnancy, recognizing the challenges of parenting for first-time parents, especially parents with existing risk factors (e.g. age, poverty, trauma status; Ordway et al., 2014),. For instance, perinatal programs have been designed to equip couples with communication and co-parenting skills (Feinberg, Jones, Kan, & Goslin, 2010; Feinberg & Kan, 2008), promotion of maternal feelings of competence in infant caretaking as well as improvement of maternal sensitivity Page 6 of 49 and the quality of mother -infant interactions (Cheng et al., 2007) and attachment (Ordway et al., 2014). Similar programs target parents in the first few months post -birth, specifically to address the risks associated with prematurity/low birth weight (e.g. parental distress; Singer et al., 1999), which in turn predict poorer child outcomes including internalizing problems (Spittle et al., 2010). Given that internalizing prob lems have their modal onset in middle to late childhood (Kessler et al., 2012), programs that target the early -childhood, preschool years attempt to address the risk and protective factors for internalizing problems, including behavioural inhibition and overprotective parenting (Dadds & Roth, 2008; Rapee, Kennedy, Ingram, Edwards, & Sweeney, 2005), before these factors become entrenched or start to impact on the child's functioning. Programs that are delivered during the mid-late childhood phase (primary school age) target parents of children at increased risk for internalizing problems, for example, due to parental psychopathology (Lam, Kelley, 2008; Solantaus, Paavonen, 2009) or parental separation (Wolchik et al., 1993). Others target parents whose child has existing difficulties such as sleep problems (Quach, Hiscock, & Wake, 2010) or childhood phobias (Santacruz, Mendez, & Sanchez- Meca, 2006); or aim to prepare parents for the challenges of the ad olescent years (Mason et al., 2007). Parenting interventions targeted at parents of adolescents are rare, but the few notable ones include a program targeting parents with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, given the increased risk it imposes on their adolescents (e.g. prematurely assuming more responsibility, threat of loss of parent; Rotheram -Borus, Lee, Gwadz, & Draimin, 2001); and another aims to increase parents' emotion socialization skills (Kehoe, Havighurst, & Harley, 2014) in the face of increased negative emotionality in parent -child interactions during adolescence (Yap, Schwartz, Byrne, Simmons, & Allen, 2010). In this review, we will examine whether preventive effects differ as a function of the developmental stage during which the intervention is delivered. Who is the target population of parents? Related to the question of timing, is one about the target population: do preventive effects vary depending on the target population of parents the interventions were designed for? Within the Page 7 of 49 original Institute of Medicine's proposed classification system delineating the mental health intervention spectrum (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994), preventive parenting programs can be universal , i.e. delivered to all parents regardless of their child's risk (e.g. Cheng et al., 2007; Dadds & Roth, 2008; Mason et al., 2007); selective , focussing on parents of children with known risk factors (e.g. Ginsburg, 2009; Rapee et al., 2005; Spittle et al., 2010); or indicated, focussing on parents whose child has signs or symptoms of incipient disorder (e.g. Ruffolo, Kuhn, & Evans, 2005; Simon, Bogels, & Voncken, 2011). Other parenting interventions have been designed to treat early childhood problems (e.g. childhood trauma, J. A. Cohen & Mannarino, 1998; darkness phobia, Santacruz et al., 2006) with the aim to prevent subsequent internalizing problems (i.e. secondary prevention). Given our whole -of-childhood focus in this review, we adopted a broader definition of prevention which includes such treatment or secondary prevention interventions (O'Connell et al., 2009). Universal preventive parenting programs are advantageous because they can reduce the stigma parents fear would be attached to them as 'bad parents' or their child as having problems that require intervention, if they participate in parenting programs (Yap, Fowler, Reavley, & Jorm, 2015). Universal interventions can be cost-effective if they are effective and acceptable to individuals, incur a low cost per person, and c arry a low risk of harm (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994). In line with the classic, empirically -supported Health Belief Model (Becker, 1974), when parents are aware of their child's increased risk or otherwise concerned about their child, they are more likely to engage in preventive parenting programs. Consequently, parents tend to self- select into prevention programs based on their child's increased risk (Dadds & Roth, 2008), which seems to suggest that selective and indicated programs may have better uptake. Another potential advantage of selective and indicated programs is that they may yield larger effect sizes relative to universal programs (Teubert & Pinquart, 2011), although meta -analyses of preventive programs for internalizing problems (targeting the individual directly) have not consistently demonstrated this difference (e.g. Fisak et al., 2011; Merry et al., 2011; van Zoonen et al., 2014). This review of preventive parenting Page 8 of 49 interventions will examine whether the type of prevention or target population moderates the preventive effects. Does the focus of the parenting program matter? As a reflection of the multifaceted nature of a parent's role in prevention of child internalizing problems, preventive parenting programs have incorporated various sets of intervention foci, including parenting skills, parent -child interaction/relationship, parents' own mental health, and training parents to be a co-therapist or coach for the child. Most parenting interventions have been designed to modify specific familial or parental factors that are theoretically and empirically believed to influence risk for child anxiety or depression. For example, many focus on building specific parenting skills, such as minimizing family conflict (e .g. Ginsburg, 2009; Wolchik et al., 2000), given its impact on the child's emotional security and subsequent risk for internalizing problems (Cummings & Davies, 2002). Parental over -involvement has also been a target of parenting programs (e.g. Ginsburg, 2009; Rapee et al., 2005), given its well-established link especially with child anxiety, through reinforcement of the child's perceptions of the world as a dangerous place (Rapee, 1991). Notably, these parenting skills have been identified in recent meta -analyses as having sound evidence for their association with depression, anxiety, and/or internalizing symptoms in children (Yap & Jorm, 2015) and adolescents (Yap et al., 2014). Fundamentally influenced by classic attachment theory (Bowlby, 1971) highlighting the importance of the parent -child bond throughout development, other programs have targeted the parent -child relationship. These focus on developing healthy parent -child communication and supportive parenting (e.g. Beardslee, Gladstone, Wright, & Cooper, 2003), which comprise the general positive parenting construct of warmth or acceptance, another modifiable parental factor identified as having sound evidence for its association with internalizing symptoms in children (Yap & Jorm, 2015), and reduced depression and anxiety in adolescents (Yap et al., 2014). In a similar vein, programs for parents of pre-term infants (e.g. Spittle et al., 2010) or first-time parents (Cheng et al., Page 9 of 49 2007) focus on improving parent responsiveness and sensitivity in their interactions with their infants. Given that children of parents with mood or anxiety disorders are at higher risk for developing such problems themselves, due to both genetic heritability (Boomsma et al., 2005) and environmental factors including the impact of parental psychopathology on parenting, parent -child attachment, and interparental conflict (Siegenthaler, Munder, & Egger, 2012); various programs also specifically focus on improving parental mental health (e.g. Solantaus et al., 2009). Finally, some programs, especially those targeting anxiety in younger children within a cognitive behavior therapy framework, are designed to train parents to be their child's therapist or coach in overcoming the child's fears and anxieties (e.g. Rapee et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2006). While parenting programs may include more than one intervention focus, this review will examine whether preventive effects vary depending on whether any of the above -mentioned foci is included in the intervention. Does additional direct intervention with the child make a difference? Extant evidence indicates that internalizing problems in young people can be prevented. Some recent reviews and meta -analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that preventive interventions primarily directed at young people themselves have the potential to reduce depressive symptoms and disorder (Merry et al., 2011; van Zoonen et al., 2014), and anxiety symptoms and disorder (Fisa k et al., 2011; Teubert & Pinquart, 2011). Other reviews have included RCTs of interventions that focused on the family, parent, couple, child or various combinations (Siegenthaler et al., 2012; Stathakos & Roehrle, 2003) or group parenting programs only (Barlow et al., 2010) and have also found small but significant mean effects on child internalizing symptoms. However, it is unclear whether interventions that are directed primarily at the parent (i.e where the parent receives most of the intervention), r egardless of whether the child receives any direct intervention, or whether the program is individual - or group -based, are effective in reducing child internalizing problems. In order to address the question of whether it is fruitful to primarily target parents in preventive efforts for child internalizing problems, a review of preventive parenting Page 10 of 49 programs where the parent receives most of the intervention is required. In addition, within such a review, moderator analyses can examine whether adding direct intervention with the child can enhance the preventive effects. Aim of this review The main aim of this review was to examine the long -term effects of preventive parenting interventions for child internalizing problems. We also sought to examine whether the size of preventive effects changes over time. In addition, we examined whether the type of prevention (target population), the focus of the parenting intervention, the timing of the intervention, and whether the child receives any direct intervention modifies the effects of parenting interventions. Method Literature search and study selection PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception up until 2 July 2015 using controlled vocabulary and free text words. The search terms used for PubMed were: (depressive disorder[mh] OR depressi*[tw] OR anxiety[tw] OR trial[pt] OR controlled clinical trial[pt]) AND parent*[tw]. The search terms used for the other databases are presented in Appendix A. Titles and abstracts were screened by a single author, and the full-text of any potentially eligible papers was then examined independently by two authors. Disagreements about eligibility were settled by consensus or by a third author. References in included studies and relevant reviews were also examined for potential inclusion. See Figure 1 for the flow of selection of eligible papers, and Appendix B for the list of excluded papers, along with the reason(s) for exclusion. Studies were included in the current review if they: Page 11 of 49 a) were reported as randomized controlled trials with a no-treatment control group, an attention control group (including minimal interventions not intended to be active), or treatment as usual or normal service provision; b) targeted parents or caregivers of children from birth to 18 years; c) involved interventions that aimed to improve child outcomes indirectly through parents as a mediator (e.g., modification of parenting practices, improvin g parent/child relationships, improving parental functioning, coaching parents to provide an intervention for their children's own difficulties); d) aimed to improve child internalizing problems through universal, selective or indicated prevention, or secondary prevention (e.g., treatment of darkness phobia in early childhood to prevent later internalizing problems). Whilst the inclusion of secondary prevention programs deviates from the more conventional purist definition of prevention (Mrazek & Hagge rty, 1994), it is aligned with the more recent and broader definition (O'Connell et al., 2009). Secondary prevention studies included participants with diagnosable difficulties identified through rigorous assessment (e.g. structured clinical interviews), and thus could be considered a form of treatment. However, most other studies fail to use similarly rigorous assessment to ascertain that their participants did not in fact have current or previous clinically diagnosable disorders; hence making it less logical to exclude secondary prevention studies. Moreover, intervening with early difficulties such as specific phobia has the potential benefit of preventing more generalised anxiety and depression outcomes later in life (Kessler et al., 2005; Mathew, Pettit, Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Roberts, 2011); e) evaluated interventions that focused on improving internalizing problems, including internalising measures, anxiety measures, and depression measures, as a major goal and not merely as a by-product. Interventions that were designed to prevent other outcomes (e.g. substance use or externalising disorders) were excluded, even if they retrospectively Page 12 of 49 examined the effects of their interventions on internalizing problems (e.g. Trudeau, Spoth, Randall, & Azevedo, 2007); f) spent the majority of the intervention time with the parents (i.e., more than 50%), although children could have received some intervention directly from the interventionist. Therefore studies were excluded if they evaluated a dual -component intervention delivered equally to parents and children (e.g. Compas, 2009; Sandler et al., 2003), or the parenting component was a small add -on to a child -focused intervention (e.g. Lowry -Webster, Barrett, & Lock, 2003); g) used validated internalising measures, anxiety measures and depression measures at least 6 months after the intervention ended1. A follow -up point of at least 6 months post - intervention was chosen as this was thought to be the minimum length of time required for any true preventive effects to be demonstrated (whilst being sufficiently distant to differentiate these from any immediate effects post -intervention), and is a typical follow -up point in the literature (e.g. Cairns, Yap, Pilkington, & Jorm, 2014; Ryan, Jorm, & Lubman, 2010); h) were reported in English. Studies that evaluated interventions in children with developmental disorders, physical disabilities, medical conditions, or distress about facing medical interventions were excluded. Data extraction Two authors independently extracted key study characteristics and outcomes using a data extraction form that was piloted on three studies. Study characteristics included: the target prevention population, inclusion and exclusion criteria, inter vention/recruitment setting, country, age and gender of children, sample size and dropouts, description of the intervention and comparison 1 Only two studies offered booster sessions after the intervention had ended (Etter, 2014; Ginsburg, 2009); but neither reported the uptake of these sessions. These booster sessions were not considered as part of the intervention when calculating the follow -up interval. Page 13 of 49 condition (program name, focus of intervention, content outline, delivery format, number/length of sessions scheduled and delivered, length of intervention, whether child received direct intervention), risk of bias (see below), and assessment time points and measures used. The focus of the intervention was coded as parenting skills (e.g. modelling, child management strategies), parent - child relationship (e.g. reducing family conflict, improving interactions), parental mental health (e.g. managing cancer- related emotions), parent as coach of child's problem (e.g. app lying anxiety exposure hierarchies with their child), or other, with multiple foci possible. Comparison conditions were coded as usual care (defined by the study), no treatment, minimal intervention (minimal versions of the intervention not expected to be as effective, e.g., fact sheets, parenting lecture), attention control, or extended waitlist (where the intervention was offered to the control group once the long- term follow -up assessments were completed). In studies that included more than one eligible intervention arm, data were extracted from the condition that was the main focus of the study, or was randomly selected by a coin toss (for 2 eligible arms) or a web -based randomizer (www.randomizer.org ; for more than 2 eligible arms) if this was unclear. Where studies reported analyses that combined multiple eligible intervention arms and data for the intervention arm of interest could not be obtained from study authors, the combined data was extracted if it was meaningful to include the combined data. This decision was reached by consensus amongst the authors and was based on whether the intervention arms were considered similar enough to each other in terms of intervention foci (e.g. the same intervention but in segregated gender groups), and to other included studies in general. Information needed to compute effect sizes (e.g., means and standard deviations) was extracted from measures of internalizing symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms for each informant, where available, and at each follow -up time -point 6 months or more after the end of the intervention. Where means and standard deviations were not available, we extracted the effect size as reported (e.g., means and sample size of each group, and the p value) if it was accepted by Comprehensive Meta -Analysis (CMA) Version 3 (Comprehensive Meta Analysis, 2013). When Page 14 of 49 adjusted and unadjusted data were reported, unadjusted data were extracted unless the adjusted data controlled for baseline differences in the dependent variable or variables that were closely associated with the dependent variable (e.g., externalizing symptoms). CMA then converted all extracted continuous effect size measures into Cohen's standardized difference in means, d (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009). For anxiety and depressive disorder diagnoses, we extracted the number of participants meeting criteria for clinically significant disorder on standardised instruments yielding diagnoses, such as the Schedule for Affective Disorders for Children (K-SADS). Following Merry and colleagues' Cochrane review (Merry et al., 2011), these data were pooled using a Risk Difference (RD). Data from studies which used a pre-determined cut-off to identify participants who were likely to have, or did have clinically significant depressive or anxiety symptoms, were included in the meta -analysis of continuous measures (to derive Cohen's d) only. Disagreements were settled by consensus or by a third author. Attempts were made to contact study authors to provide missing information. Risk of bias Risk of bias of each study was independently assessed by two authors using a descriptive approach. Information about potential sources of bias was extracted for each of the following criteria according to the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting of internalizing problems (Higgins & Green, 2011). These criteria were judged as high -risk, low-risk, or unclear, with supporting justification. Data synthesis A meta -analysis was conducted separately for internalizing symptoms, depressive symptoms, depressive diagnoses, anxiety symptoms, and anxiety diagnoses using CMA. To examine intervention effects for internalizing problems as a broad construct, a meta- analysis was also conducted that included data from all included studies regardless of the type of outcome measure they used Page 15 of 49 (measures of internalizing, anxiety, or depressive symptoms). Where studies used more than one of these outcome measures , we applied the following hierarchy for selecting which outcome from that study to include in the meta -analysis: (1) internalizing measure, given that the majority of studies used this type of measure; (2) anxiety measure, given that anxiety symptoms are more prevalent than depressive symptoms across childhood, and are believed to be a precursor of subsequent depression (Kessler et al., 2005; Mathew et al., 2011); and (3) depression measure. A random effects model was used in all meta -analyses because we expected considerable heterogeneity. We calculated the Q and I2 statistics as indicators of heterogeneity. An I2 value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity and larger values indicate greater heterogeneity (25%=low, 50%=moderate, 75%=high; Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003). When the meta -analysis involved at least 3 studies, we tested for publication bias by inspecting the funnel plot of the meta -analysis and by using Egger's test (Egger, Smith, & Phillips, 1997). To obtain an estimate of the effect size after publication bias, we used the Duval & Tweedie (2000) 'trim -and-fill' procedure, which allows the imputation of potentially missing studies. A guideline of four or more studies imputed is taken as indicative of publication bias (Borenstein et al., 2009). For each outcome of in terest, we conducted one overall meta -analysis which included one effect size from each eligible study. When studies reported data from more than one follow -up, we used the effect size from the longest follow -up interval. When a study reported an effect size from more than one informant (e.g., child -report and mother -report), we applied the following hierarchy, which was adapted from a recent meta- analytic review (Yap & Jorm, 2015), in order of preference for data extraction: (1) composite of parent and child computed through models which take into account the correlation between measures, based on the argument that this reduces the risk of bias associated with reliance on a sole informant (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003); (2) child -report, given that in most studies the child did not receive direct intervention and is hence less subject to outcome assessment bias compared to parents; (3) parent -report, which is less preferred compared to child -report because parents are more subject to bias than are children; but preferable to Page 16 of 49 teacher -report because parent -child agreement on child internalizing symptoms has been found to be higher than teacher -child agreement (Phares, Compas, & Howell, 1989; Stanger & Lewis, 1993). If both mother -report and father- report were obtained, mother -report data was selected over father- report, because most other included studies with parent -reported outcomes involved a mother informant; and (4) teacher. However, since the mean effect coul d differ at varying follow -up periods and depending on the informant, we conducted a series of supplementary analyses for each of these factors. Firstly, we examined Cohen's d for each follow -up period separately (6-10 months, >10-12 months, >12-24 months, >24-48 months, and >48 months). Secondly, where subsets of studies with data from each informant (e.g., father, mother, child, teacher, combinations) had more than two comparisons each, we also examined Cohen's d for each subset. Given that some studies had data at more than one follow -up interval or from more than one informant (e.g., one study with 7-month, 13-month, and 36-month follow -up data would be included in three analyses), the subsets of studies were not mutually exclusive and hence differences between subsets were not examined. If a study reported an effect size for more than one independent subgroup in their sample (e.g., older versus younger mothers, single - versus dual -family, female versus male adolescents), we included each subgroup as a separate 'study'. Where there were more than two comparisons in each meta -analysis and heterogeneity was not zero, we conducted subgroup analyses for dichotomous moderators and meta -regression analyses for continuous variables, according to the procedures implemented in CMA. These analyses were conducted using mixed -effects analyses that pooled studies within subgroups with the random effects model, but tested for significant differences between subgroups with the fixed effects model. We examined whether the mean effect size (Cohen's d) was modified by type of prevention (universal, selective, indicated, secondary); whether the intervention included a focus on parent - child relationship, parenting skills, parental mental health, or training parents to coach their child (e.g., using exposure techniques); timing of intervention (birth: 0-2.99 months, preschool : 3 months - Page 17 of 49 4 years, primary -school: >5 -12 years, adolescence: 12+ years); type of comparison (no treatment, attention control, extended waitlist, minimal intervention, usual care); and whether there was direct intervention with the child. We also conducted meta -regression analyses in which we used only the longest follow -up period reported in each study, to explore whether the effect size varied depending on the duration of the follow -up period. When interpreting mean effect sizes, we followed Cohen's (1992) guidelines whereby d of at least 0.2=small, 0.5=medium, and 0.8=large. Results Study characteristics A total of 66 reports of 51 studies were eligible for inclusion. Of these, six studies were excluded from meta- analyses because they did not provide sufficient data to compute effect sizes. Key characteristics are summarised in Table 1 and characteristics of each study are available in Appendix C (Tables C1 and C2). Most studies were classed as selective prevention, based on a variety of risk factors including pre-term infants, children of a parent with a mental disorder, children at risk of maltreatment, and children of divorced parents. Interventions were usually conducted with parents of children from birth to primary school age, with very few studies targeting parents of adolescents. The majority of studies (k=34) had multiple foci of intervention. A dual focus on improving both parenting skills and the parent -child relationship was the most common combination (k=18). Interventions were delivered in a variety of formats, including parent groups, individual sessions, and home visits, and in most studies the child had no direct involvement in the intervention. When reported, the scheduled intervention dose varied greatly from 1 to 114 hours, but about half lasted 10 hours or less. Most were delivered in 3 months or less, but a few lasted more than one year, with one intervention lasting 4 years on average (Fergusson, Boden, & Horwood, 2013). The level of adherence to the scheduled intervention length (i.e., number of sessions delivered) was poorly reported and is available in Appendix Table C2. Most parenting interventions were compared to a Page 18 of 49 'usual care' or no treatment condition, with few studies using an attention control condition. About a third of studies followed up participants more than once, with the longest follow -up occurring 15 years after the end of the intervention. However, half followed participants for 12 months or less after the end of the intervention. Risk of bias in included studies (see Appendix C3) Selection bias Of the 51 included studies reports, the majority (k=33) described an adequate method to generate the allocation sequence (e.g., computer -generated random number sequence), and were judged as low risk of bias on the random sequence generation criterion. One study was judged as high -risk (Dadds & Roth, 2008), and the remaining did not report sufficient detail to be confident that the allocation sequence was genuinely randomized. In many studies (k=28), it was unclear what techniques (if any) had been used to conceal the allocation sequence from participants and those involved in the enrolment and assignment of participants. Two studies were judged to be at high risk of bias, and 20 studies were judged to have a low risk of bias from allocation concealment. Detection bias The risk of bias associated with blinding of outcome assessment varied within studies depending on the outcome measure used. Measures that were completed by parents were usually judged to be at high risk of bias, as parents were usually aware of which condition they had been allocated to. These were typically more common than instruments completed by others, such as clinicians or teachers, which were more likely to be judged as low risk of bias. Child self- report measures were assumed to be low risk unless the child was directly involved in the intervention, in which case they were judged to be at high risk of bias. Page 19 of 49 There were 57 reports (from 44 studies) that used internalizing measures, and only nine of these included a measure rated low -risk of detection bias due to adequate blinding of outcome assessment. Five reports measured depression diagnoses, and two of these reported adequate blinding of outcome assessors, with the remaining rated high risk of bias (k=2) or unclear (k=1). Eleven reports assessed depression symptoms, and six of these relied on an informant who was adequately blinded and at low risk of bias. For anxiety diagnoses, 8 of 11 reports were judged as low risk of bias due to adequate blinding of outcome assessment. Sixteen studies measured anxiety symptoms, with seven of these judged as low risk of bias due to adequate blinding of assessment. Attrition bias Given the lengthy follow -up periods involved in included studies, it is unsurprising that many reports (k=34) were judged to be at high risk of bias from incomplete outcome data. Most of these had dropout rates greater than 15% and analysed data from complete cases only. Thirty reports were judged to have a low risk of bias due to low levels of incomplete outcome data and/or the use of adequate statistical methods to account for missing data (e.g. multiple imputation, maximum - likelihood based methods; Salim & et al., 2008), and two reports did not provide enough information from which to make a valid judgement. Reporting bias The risk of bias from selective reporting of outcome measures was unclear in 44 reports (33 studies) due to the unavailability of a study protocol. Seven reports were judged as low risk of bias due to the reporting of all relevant outcomes included in their study protocol, and 15 reports were judged as high -risk. High- risk selective reporting was typically because outcomes were reported incompletely and couldn't be used in the meta -analyses (e.g. reporting 'no significant differences' and providing no data), or results from a key outcome of interest were not reported. Overall, for the meta -analysis involving measures of internalizing symptoms, there were only 2 out of 35 studies that did not have a potential high risk of bias in any category. This was mainly due to a Page 20 of 49 high risk of detection bias from the use of parent self- report outcome measures (k = 31) or incomplete outcome data (k = 16). Similarly, most studies in the meta -analyses involving measures of anxiety symptoms (10 out of 13) and depression symptoms (6 out of 9) were at high risk of bias from parents completing outcome assessments and/or incomplete outcome data. For the meta - analysis involving measures of anxiety diagnoses, 3 of 5 studies were at high risk of bias, mainly due to incomplete outcome data, and 2 of the 3 studies in the meta -analysis involving measures of depression diagnoses were judged to have a high risk of bias in at least one category. Overall standardized difference in means and risk difference Measures of internalizing symptoms As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, the mean Cohen's d of the 37 comparisons was very small but significant (d = -0.123), with low-to-moderate heterogeneity. The funnel plot showed marginally significant asymmetry in the studies (Egger's test, two-tailed p=0.08). The Duval & Tweedie trim -and- fill approach suggested that seven studies were potentially missing and, if imputed, the mean effect size would drop to d = -0.065, and would no longer be significant (95% CI: -0.125, 0.011). Supplementary analyses revealed a significant mean effect size only from studies reporting effects at 6-10 months (k = 16; d = -0.148) and at >24- 48 months (k = 6; d = -0.124) post -intervention. The mean effect sizes for all intervals were very small, especially at 1-2 years post -intervention (d = -0.050). Regarding informants, supplementary analyses revealed significant mean effects for the mother (k = 17; d = -0.139) and parent (k = 13; d = -0.170) informant groups, which were also the most common informants across studies. Subgroup analyses revealed that the mean Cohen's d differed according to the type of prevention (p = 0.033; see Table 2). However, only two subgroups (universal and selective) could be included in this analysis, because the other subgroups had <3 comparisons each. Selective prevention programs (k = 26; d = -0.134) yielded significant effects, whereas universal programs (k = 7; d = 0.110) did not. Page 21 of 49 Findings from the remaining subgroup analyses, involving the focus and timing of intervention, type of comparison, and whether there was direct intervention with the child, were all non-significant. We also conducted a meta -regression analysis to see whether there was any decay of effect over time, using the effect size from the longest follow -up interval reported in each study. There was no significant association between Cohen's d and follow -up duration (the point estimate of the slope was 0.0008; 95% CI: -0.002 to 0.003; p = 0.494; median = 14; range = 6-180 months). Measures of depressive symptoms and diagnoses As shown in Table 3 and Figure 3, the mean Cohen's d of the 10 comparisons reporting depressive symptoms was very small but significant ( d = -0.156), with low heterogeneity and no apparent publication bias (Egger's test, two-tailed p = 0.55). Supplementary analyses revealed a significant mean effect size from studies relying on child (k = 8 comparisons; d = -0.169) or parent (k = 3; d = - 0.459) informants. Mean effects for each follow -up interval were all non-significant. Subgroup analyses were not conducted for the type of prevention or comparison, whether parenting skills or parent as coach was an intervention focus, and whether the child received direct intervention, because only one subgroup in each case had >2 comparisons. No subgroup differences were found for whether parent -child relationship or parental mental health was an intervention focus, or for timing of intervention (see Table 3). We also conducted a meta -regression analysis to see whether there was any decay of effect over time, using the effect size from the longest follow -up interval reported in each study. We found no significant association between Cohen's d and follow -up duration (the point estimate of the slope was < -0.0001; 95% CI: -0.003 to 0.003; p = 0.998; median = 21; range = 6-129 months). There were four comparisons reporting depression diagnoses (see Table 3 and Figure 4), and these yielded a pooled risk difference of -0.095 which approached significance (p = 0.071), with moderate heterogeneity but no apparent publication bias (Egger's test, two-tailed p = 0.85). Page 22 of 49 Measures of anxiety symptoms and diagnoses As shown in Table 4 and Figure 5, the 14 comparisons reporting anxiety symptoms yielded a significant small effect (d = -0.273), but with high heterogeneity. There was no apparent publication bias, Egger's test two-tailed p = 0.89. Supplementary analyses revealed a significant mean effect size from studies relying on child (k = 9; d = -0.192), parent (k = 5; d = -0.535), or the combination of parent and child informants (k = 1; d = -1.831). Mean effects for each follow -up interval were all non- significant, except for studies reporting outcomes at >10-12 month post -intervention (k = 5; d = -0.851). Subgroup analyses revealed that the mean Cohen's d differed according to whether the intervention included a focus on parental mental health (p = 0.031; see Table 4). Specifically, the 8 comparisons that did not include this focus yielded an almost -medium effect size (d = -0.458); in contrast to the 6 comparisons that did (d = -0.047). A subgroup analysis for type of comparison condition was not run because only one subgroup had >2 comparison conditions, but RCTs that involved a no-treatment (k = 7; d = -0.381) or extended waitlist ( k = 1; d = -1.831) yielded significant mean effect sizes, in contrast to RCTs that involved active control interventions. Subgroup analyses were also not run for type of prevention and whether parenting skills was an intervention focus, because only one subgroup in each case had >2 comparisons. Findings from the remaining subgroup analyses involving the focus or timing of intervention, and whether there was direct intervention with the child, were all non-significant. We also conducted a meta -regression analysis to see whether there was any decay of effect over time, using the effect size from the longest follow -up interval reported in each study. We found no significant association between Cohen's d and follow -up duration (p = 0.842; the point estimate of the slope was 0.0005; 95% CI: -0.005 to 0.006; median = 12; range = 6-129 months). Page 23 of 49 There were six comparisons reporting anxiety diagnoses (see Table 4 and Figure 6), and these yielded a significant pooled risk difference of -0.109 (p = 0.020). There was moderate -to-high heterogeneity but no apparent publication bias (Egger's test, two-tailed p = 0.22). Internalizing cluster As shown in Table 5 and Figure 6, the 45 comparisons yielded a very small but significant effect (d = - 0.177) on internalizing problems (based on data from internalizing, depressive or anxiety symptom measures), with moderate -to-high heterogeneity. There was no apparent publication bias, Egger's test two -tailed p = 0.38. Supplementary analyses revealed a significant mean effect size from studies reporting effects at 6-10 months (k = 20; d = -0.151), between 10 -12 months (k = 14; d = -0.288), between 24- 48 months (k = 7; d = -0.138), and >48 months (k = 9; d = -0.138) post -intervention. The mean effect sizes for all intervals were very small, especially at 1 -2 years post -intervention ( d = -0.078). Regarding informants, supplementary analyses revealed significant mean effects for the mother (k = 17; d = - 0.139) and parent (k = 13; d = -0.170) informant groups, which were also the most common informants across studies; as well as the child informant group (k = 9; d = -0.175). Subgroup analyses revealed that the mean Cohen's d differed according to the type of prevention (p = 0.011; see Table 5). However, only 3 subgroups (universal, selective, and secondary prevention) could be included in this analysis, because the other subgroups had <3 comparisons each. Selective (k = 30; d = -0.186) and secondary (k = 3; d = -0.770) prevention programs yielded significant effects, whereas universal programs ( k = 9; d = 0.006) did not. Findings from the remaining subgroup analyses, involving the focus and timing of intervention, type of comparison, and whether there was direct intervention with the child, were all non-significant. We also conducted a meta -regression analysis to see whether there was any decay of effect over time, using the effect size from the longest follow -up interval reported in each study. There was no Page 24 of 49 significant association between Cohen's d and follow -up duration (the point estimate of the slope was 0.0005; 95% CI: -0.002 to 0.003; p = 0.679; median = 14; range = 6-180 months). Discussion Main findings We examined whether parenting interventions directed primarily at parents are effective in preventing child internalizing problems in the longer -term. Results showed that compared to controls, parenting interventions reduced child internalizing, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, at a minimum of six months after the intervention was delivered. The mean effects were very small for internalizing and depressive symptoms, and small for anxiety symptoms. The mean effect for the internalizing cluster was also very small. The sizes of these mean effects are similar to those reported in recent reviews of effects of family -based interventions on child internalizing outcomes (Barlow et al., 2010; Siegenthaler et al., 2012). Few studies were judged to have a low risk of bias overall, and this must qualify the review's findings. Furthermore, there may be publication bias amongst studies using internalizing symptom measures, hence those findings may not be as robust and need to be interpreted with caution. Despite the small effect sizes, the effects on anxiety diagnoses translate into a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10, which means that relative to children whose parents do not receive a preventive parenting intervention, for every 10 children whose parents do receive it, one additional child could be free of an anxiety diagnosis. The effects on depression diagnoses fell just short of statistical significance but are nonetheless promising, because they translate into an NNT of less than 11, which is similar to the average NNT for the prevention of cases of depression using programs targeting young people directly (NNT=11; Merry et al., 2011). Although there is no formally recognized system of classification for the size of NNT, the NNTs for preventive parenting programs compare very favorably with programs directed towards individuals which are delivered later in life Page 25 of 49 (NNT=20; van Zoonen et al., 2014). Moreover, drawing from the broader health literature, a recent review of low -dose aspirin reported a NNT=284 to prevent 1 major cardiovascular event, and a NNT=614 to prevent 1 ischaemic stroke, over a mean follow -up of 6.8 years (Xie et al., 2014). Similarly, a Cochrane review of the benefits of statins the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease reported NNT values of 167 and 67 for individuals at <5% five-year risk and 5-10% five-year risk, respectively (Taylor et al., 2013). Another review of antihyperten sive therapy for individuals with pre-hypertensive blood pressure levels reported a NNT=169 over an average of 4.3 years to prevent one stroke (Sipahi et al., 2012). The conclusion drawn in the respective reviews was that aspirin, statins, and antihypertensive therapy were of benefit. Furthermore, it is a known phenomenon that a small change in mean scores across a population can have a beneficial effect for those in a tail of a population distribution - hence the NNTs found in our review are promising despite the small population effect sizes. Given the burden of internalizing problems especially in terms of their early onset and long- term negative sequelae, we argue that preventive parenting programs would still be a worthwhile investment in public health terms. Findings in this review were based on effects reported at the longest follow -up interval for each included study (from a minimum of 6 months post -intervention), and significant effects were maintained up to 3 years for internalizing symptoms (Spencer -Smith et al., 2012), 5.5 years for depressive symptoms (Mason et al., 2007), and 11 years for anxiety symptoms and diagnoses (Rapee, 2013). Although the intensity and duration of interventions varied widely, it is remarkable that preventive interventions directed primarily at parents can have such long -term benefits for children. Findings with implications for future prevention policy and practice Duration of preventive effects One of the key questions in this review is: for how long do the preventive effects of parenting interventions last, and do effects vary with the duration of the follow -up interval? We did not find Page 26 of 49 the duration of follow -up interval to be associated with mean effects on internalizing, depressive or anxiety symptoms, when examined separately and as an internalizing cluster (i.e. any of the 3 measures). When we examined the mean effects of parenting interventions at different follow -up intervals (6-10 months, >10-12 months, >12-24 months, >24-48 months, and >48 months), we found very small but significant mean effects on internalizing symptoms at 6 -10 months and at >24-48 months, and a large mean effect on anxiety symptoms only at >10-12 months. The mean effects on depressiv e symptoms were non -significant for each follow -up interval, although there were few studies with data at each interval. Mean effects on any internalizing measure were significant for all time intervals except between 12-24 months, and were all very small except between 10-12 months, where the mean effect was small. Overall, the current findings suggest that the small but persistent effects that preventive parenting interventions have on internalizing problems are not associated with the time that has lapsed after the intervention. Based on developmental theories, the longevity of intervention effects may be due to the bidirectional and interactive effects of parenting and child behaviours on child outcomes over time (Branje, Hale, Frijns, & B\u00f6gels, 2009; Yap et al., 2007). For instance, it is possible that parenting interventions may improve parenting skills (e.g. reducing overprotection), which may in turn increase child exploration, and in turn increase parental encouragement of child independence. Over time, these interactive, bidirectional processes may build on one another to maintain positive intervention effects in decreasing the child's risk for internalizing problems, for years after the intervention had ended. Timing of intervention An important question for implementation of preventive parenting interventions is when in the child's development should interventions be delivered. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant moderation of intervention effects by the timing of delivery of preventive parenting interventions, on any of the three sets of measures, or on the internalizing cluster. Nonetheless, some patterns of findings are noteworthy. Firstly, children seem to benefit if their parents received parenting Page 27 of 49 interventions during the primary -school years, with a small mean effect based on internalizing measures and for the internalizing cluster, and a medium mean effect based on measures of anxiety symptoms. Secondly, programs delivered to parents very early in their child's life, including the antenatal period, may yield long -term (albeit small) preventive effects on measures of child internalizing symptoms, and on internalizing problems as a cluster. Thirdly, timing of intervention did not modify the effects of parenting interventions on depressive symptoms, possibly due to inadequate power to detect group differences. Nonetheless it is notable that the two studies where the parenting intervention was delivered during adolescence yielded a significant mean effect (albeit very small), whereas the other studies delivered in preschool and primary -school phases did not. It is possible that the effects of parenting programs on child depression may not be apparent until later in adolescence, given that the rates of depression increase more rapidly during mid-adolescence (Kessler et al., 2007). Overall, very few parenting interventions were d elivered during adolescence. This is unsurprising given that most interventions for youth mental health are directed at young people themselves, with parents either not receiving any direct intervention or receiving only a brief psychoeducation supplement focusing on informing parents about what their child is receiving, and/or how parents can support their child's intervention (Brunwasser & Garber, 2015; Hetrick, Cox, & Merry, 2015). However, this approach seems amiss given the sound evidence that some modifiable parental factors are associated with adolescent depression and anxiety (Yap et al., 2014). Such evidence highlights the potential of parenting interventions that target such modifiable parental factors for reducing adolescent risk for depression and anxiety. Taken together, findings to date underscore an important gap in preventive parenting interventions targeted at parents of adolescents, as a complement to adolescent -directed interventions, some of which have shown promising benefits for adolescent depression (Merry et al., 2011). Page 28 of 49 Target population When implementing preventive interventions, a key question is who should receive the intervention. We sought to examine whether the mean effects of parenting interventions varied depending on the target population or the type of prevention the interventions were designed for: universal, selective, indicated, or secondary/treatment. Unfortunately, due to the small number of studies which used measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms and diagnoses, a subgroup analysis could only be conducted for internalizing symptoms and the internalizing cluster. However, in the former analysis, only two groups could be compared (universal versus selective), and a significant group difference was found, favoring selective (very small but significant mean effect) over universal (non -significant mean effect) programs. Nonetheless, a large effect was found for the single indicated prevention program and a medium mean effect for two secondary prevention programs. Findings for the internalizing cluster were similar: a significant difference emerged in the subgroup analysis involving 3 subgroups: universal, selective, and secondary. Mean effects were significant for selective and secondary prevention but not universal prevention; however an examination of confidence intervals suggests that the difference is significant only between secondary prevention and universal prevention programs. Although subgroup analyses were not conducted for measures of depressive or anxiety symptoms, it is interesting to note that for both outcomes, universal programs yielded significant mean effects, albeit in the very small to small range; whereas all other targeted programs yielded non-significant mean effects. In sum, evidence to-date is inconclusive about whether the type of prevention modifies the long - term effects of parenting interventions. However, consistent with findings from other preventive programs (e.g. Merry et al., 2011), they suggest the promise of selective and secondary prevention parenting programs for internalizing problems, at least relative to universal programs. This is unsurprising given that universal programs are subject to 'floor effects', whereby participants have minimal problems at pre-intervention, making it more difficult to demonstrate improvement. Further research is required to address this question more definitively, given the disproportionately Page 29 of 49 larger number of RCTs of selective programs, and the exploratory and observational nature of the subgroup analyses conducted. Nonetheless, it has also been argued that although universal programs may have a smaller effect than selective or indicated programs at the level of the individual, they may have a great public health impact because they reach a larger proportion of the population (Phares et al., 1989; Rose, 1992), and have the potential to shift the population mean (Rose, 1992). Focus of intervention Parenting interventions have been developed from a wide range of approaches and theoretical frameworks, and hence vary widely in their focus and targets. To inform future development and implementation of parenting interventions, we were interested in whether the fo cus of interventions modified their effects. Most of the interventions identified in this review included a focus on improving parenting skills and/or the parent -child relationship, and most included one or two foci. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant differences between interventions that included each of the four foci and interventions that did not, for all three measures of child internalizing problems. The only exception was for parental mental health, whereby interventions that did not include a focus on parents' own mental health had an almost -medium mean effect on child anxiety symptoms, whereas interventions that did include that focus yielded a non-significant mean effect. This concurs with evidence that parenting behaviors (e.g. parental over- involvement or over - controlling behaviors) may have a stronger association with child anxiety than with parent anxiety (Van Der Bruggen, Stams, & B\u00f6gels, 2008), as well as findings from a recent Cochrane review that group parenting programs improved parental depression and anxiety only at post -intervention, but had no lasting effects on parental mental health (Barlow, Smailagic, Huband, Roloff, & Bennett, 2014). These findings suggest that parental mental health may not be a fruitful target for parenting interventions to prevent child anxiety. However, other possible explanations for these findings should be considered. Firstly, all 6 studies which included a focus on parental mental health also included one (in 3 studies) or two (in 3 other studies) other intervention foci. It is possible that a Page 30 of 49 focus on parental mental health was included at the expense of other foci, or simply reduced the amount of intervention time that could be focused on modifying other risk or protective factors for child anxiety, resulting in the dilution of effects from each component. Secondly, it could be argued that programs which included a focus on parental mental health may have targeted parents with mental health problems or who may be at elevated risk for such difficulties, and this may have limited the degree of change in parenting and hence in child benefits. Indeed, of the 6 studies that included a focus on parental mental health, 1 targeted parental risk factors, 2 targeted parents with psychopathology (mood disorder or alcohol abuse), 2 targeted parents with terminal illness (HIV/AIDS or breast cancer), and 1 targeted young mothers from an ethnic minority group. However, Sieganthaler and colleagues' (2012) review found that parenting programs for parents with mental illness yielded promising effects on child internalizing problems, suggesting that parental mental illness does not hinder the effectiveness of parenting programs. An important caveat to note is that this review did not identify any program that focused solely on parental mental health; hence it remains possible that such programs may have preventive effects on child anxiety. It is also important to note that the main meta -analyses examining effects on measures of internalizing symptoms and the internalizing cluster yielded significant mean effects in programs that did include a focus on parental mental health. More research is clearly required before any meaningful conclusions can be drawn. All other subgroup analyses for all three sets of measures and the internalizing cluster revealed no significant differences between interventions that included a particular focus and those that did not. There was high between -trial heterogeneity in many subgroups, suggestin g that interventions categorized as sharing a similar focus differed in meaningful ways that may have influenced their effects on child internalizing problems. Page 31 of 49 Direct intervention with child This review only included interventions where parents received the majority of the intervention, were the primary targets of intervention, and were assumed to be key agents of change in child outcomes. However, some interventions included direct intervention with the child either in family sessions or individually with the interventionist. Of interest, we found that including a component of direct intervention with the child in such programs did not yield significantly different mean effects on measures of internalizing and anxiety symptoms, or the internalizing cluster. A subgroup analysis could not be conducted for measures of depressive symptoms, but the pattern of findings was similar to that for internalizing and anxiety symptoms: the 8 comparisons involving no direct child intervention yielded a significant small mean effect, whereas the other 2 did not. Taken together, our findings suggest that in parenting interventions primarily directed at the parents, adding a child intervention component may not yield significant differences in benefits for child internalizing problems. Although some parents may prefer to involve their child in an intervention, and it may be logical to expect that intervening directly with the child in addition to the parent would produce synergistic effects, the current findings suggest that this may not be necessary. This is promising in terms of intervention delivery, because it is likely to be more efficient and easier logistically to deliver the intervention to parents only, especiall y on a larger scale. It also underscores the potential of interventions directed primarily at parents to indirectly benefit the child, presumably through modifying parental behaviors, even into the longer term. It is important to note however, that substantive evidence has already demonstrated that direct intervention with young people can prevent depression (Merry et al., 2011) and anxiety (Fisak et al., 2011; Teubert & Pinquart, 2011); hence our findings should not be interpreted as suggesting that child intervention is ineffective. Indeed, the subgroup analysis for the internalizing cluster yielded significant mean effects regardless of whether the program included direct intervention with the child (i.e. mean effects were significant in both subgroups). Instead, it is likely that the child intervention component of some of the parenting programs included in our review may have been Page 32 of 49 too small to have yielded significant additional benefits. Nonetheless, our findings are consistent with those reported in a review of the effects of preventive interventions in mentally -ill parents on children's internalizing symptoms, which included some interventions which were directed solely at adolescents, some which involved both parents and children (equally), and some \u2014like the current review \u2014which were directly solely or primarily at parents (Siegenthaler et al., 2012). On the other hand, there is also evidence suggesting that in intervention programs primarily directed at young people, adding a parent intervention component may not yield significant additive benefits for child depression (David -Ferdon & Kaslow, 2008) or anxiety (Hudson et al., 2015). Whilst it remains to be ascertained why dual -component programs do not seem to yield robust synergistic benefits, what is clear is that each type of program \u2014those directed at young people, and those directed at parents \u2014 has preventive effects on child internalizing problems. Training and qualifications of interventionists Although not central to the focus of this review, it is noteworthy that of the 51 included studies, the vast majority involved intervention programs that were delivered by trained specialist professionals (e.g. clinical psychologists; k=30) or non-specialist professionals or paraprofessionals (e.g. trained nurses or research assistants; k=15). This has important implications for the cost and feasibility of disseminating such interventions in the larger scale, and needs to be taken into account when assessing the cost -effectiveness of the programs. Unfortunately, the training, experience and qualification of interventionists are not easy to quantify objectively and consistently, and is inadequately described in many studies. Implications for future research Informant Given existing evidence of modest cross -informant agreements (Phares et al., 1989; Stanger & Lewis, 1993), we examined the mean effects of parenting interventions for each group of informants of child outcomes. For internalizing measures, significant mean effects were found only for studies that Page 33 of 49 relied on mother or parent informants; mean effects were non-significant for all other informant groups. Despite increasing interest in the effects of fathering on child mental health and discrepancies between father- and mother -reports (e.g. B\u00f6gels, Bamelis, & van der Bruggen, 2008; Teubert & Pinquart, 2011), there were only three studies that included both father and mother as independent reporters of their child's symptoms, all utilizing measures of internalizing symptoms, and these yielded a non -significant mean effect. For depressive and anxiety measures, significant small mean effects were found for child informants and medium effects for parent informants; but mean effects were non -significant for other informant groups. For the internalizing cluster, mean effects were significant for 3 groups of informants: child, mother, and parent. Notably, when evaluating the effects of parenting interventions directed primarily at parents, it is likely that child informants would be less subject to outcome assessment bias than parent informants, given that children are not direct recipients of the intervention in most cases. Moreover, as argued in a recent review (Yap & Jorm, 2015), widely -used child self- report depressive and anxiety symptom measures have been validated with children as young as 7 (e.g. the Children's Depression 8 (e.g. the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale; Spence, 1998; Spence, Barrett, & Turner, 2003) years. Furthermore, given that children are privy to their own internal experiences, and internalizing problems are less observable to independent observers (De Los Reyes & Kazdin, 2005), evidence to date suggests that when it is age appropriate, child informants should be relied upon as the primary source of child outcomes in trials of parenting interventions. Type of comparison condition Although our main meta -analyses included all eligible studies regardless of the comparison or control conditions employed in the trials, we expected mean effects to vary depending on the comparison condition. However, due to small numbers of comparisons in most subgroups, a Page 34 of 49 subgroup analysis could only be conducted for measures of internalizing symptoms, comparing four subgroups (excluding extended waitlist comparisons), and this revealed no significant group differences. A subgroup analysis was also conducted for the internalizing cluster, which included all 5 subgroups, but this also yielded no significant group differences. Nonetheless, only studies that compared their interventions to usual -care (the most common comparison condition) yielded a significant mean effect on internalizing measures. For the internalizing cluster, significant mean effects emerged for interventions that were compared to either no -treatment or usual -care comparisons. It is noteworthy that the usual -care comparison employed in many of these studies involved standard medical care, case management or maternal and child health nursing support. Although some of these included referrals for psychotherapeutic or counselling support for the parent if required, most of them did not provide any active intervention specifically aimed at reducing risk for child internalizing problems. Hence these findings suggest that parenting interventions may yield significant benefits for child internalizing problems compared to usual care. However, further research comparing these parenting interventions to active comparisons (especially alternative parenting interventions) is required in order to most stro ngly demonstrate the effectiveness of these interventions (Stathakos & Roehrle, 2003). For measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms, we found that studies employing non-active (i.e. no treatment, extended waitlist) or less active (e.g. minimal intervention) comparisons yielded significant mean effects, whereas studies employing more active comparisons (i.e. attention -control and usual -care) did not. This is consistent with findings from Merry and colleagues' (2011) review. These are important caveats to note when considering the effectiveness of parenting interventions to date on child anxiety and depressive symptoms, and underscore the importance of future trials employing more active comparison conditions, in order to establish whether these parenting interventions offer preventive benefits for the child beyond simply involving parents in a parenting intervention (Stathakos & Roehrle, 2003). Nonetheless, the persistence of intervention effects makes it less likely that the effects are merely the results of attention. Page 35 of 49 Symptom versus diagnostic outcomes Although it would have been preferable to evaluate the long- term effects of parenting interventions on reducing the incidence of child depressive and anxiety disorders, this review identified only 3 studies reporting depressive diagnoses and 5 reporting anxiety diagnoses, which could be included in meta -analyses. Whilst the evidence on diagnostic outcomes are promising and are consistent with evidence on symptom -based measures, the small samples providing diagnostic data preclude any firm conclusions to be drawn. More studies are required that include a diagnostic measure of depression and anxiety outcomes, especially at longer -term follow -up during the second decade of life, when the incidence of case -level disorders starts to increase (Kessler et al., 2012). Differences in effects on measures of internalizing, depression and anxiety outcomes Findings from this review revealed that the effects of parenting interventions may be weaker for measures of internalizing and depressive symptoms and depressive diagnoses, compared to anxiety symptoms and diagnoses. We discuss briefly a few possible reasons for this pattern of findings. Firstly, although we did not find significant moderation of intervention effects by the timing of intervention, we did find that most of the interventions which examined internalizing symptoms as outcomes (68%) were delivered earlier in life (before the schooling years) wherea s most of the interventions which used measures of depression (70%) and anxiety (71%) were delivered in primary and high school years. Moreover, most studies using measures of internalizing symptoms only had follow -up assessments up to two years post intervention; which means that in many cases the children may still be pre -school aged when rates of internalizing problems are low. Hence, even when group differences in intervention effects on internalizing symptoms are found, the size of those effects are likely to be very small. It is also possible that the high comorbidity between anxiety and depression symptoms earlier in life (commonly measured as 'internalizing symptoms') reduces over the course of development as the symptoms start to differentiate more clearly into anxiety - specific or depression -specific symptoms. This may also account for the smaller sizes of mean effects on internalizing symptoms. Page 36 of 49 Intervention effects on depression outcomes may be less marked than those on anxiety outcomes because the rates of depression increase more rapidly during mid-adolescence (Kessler et al., 2007), but only 22% of the studies which examined depressive symptoms involved parents of adolescents; and only 33% included follow -up assessments longer than 2 years post intervention, which means that depression outcomes were assessed prior to mid-adolescence for most studies. Another possible reason for the apparent difference in effect sizes across the three outcomes is the relevance of parental risk and protective factors targeted in parenting interventions to each outcome. For example, interventions delivered earlier in the child's life tend to have a broader aim of improving general adaptation and functioning, and included internal izing as one of multiple indicators. Hence the parental factors targeted may also be more general, or may be more relevant in infancy (e.g. parental sensitivity to infant cues) but fail to be adapted for older children with more complex social interaction demands. In contrast, interventions specifically developed to prevent child anxiety may more intentionally target evidence -based parental factors associated with children's risk for anxiety (e.g. over -protection; Yap & Jorm, 2015; Yap et al., 2014). Ironic ally, recent reviews found that the evidence base for parental factors associated with child (Yap & Jorm, 2015) and adolescent (Yap et al., 2014) anxiety is more limited than the evidence base for depression and internalizing problems more generally. Nonetheless, it is possible that interventions specifically designed to prevent child anxiety are more strongly driven by the albeit- limited evidence base, relative to other programs which examined depression and internalizing problems. It is also possible that programs which target more than one evidence -based parental factor may have larger effects (Yap & Jorm, 2015; Yap et al., 2014). For example, Ginsburg and colleagues' (2009) Coping and Promoting Strength program (for parents of primary -school aged children) targets over -protection, aversiveness and inter -parental conflict, all of which have sound evidence for increasing risk for anxiety in adolescents (Yap et al., 2014) and emerging evidence for anxiety in children (Yap & Jorm, 2015). Page 37 of 49 Strengths and limitations To our knowledge, this is one of the most comprehensive systematic reviews and meta -analyses of the long- term effects of parenting interventions to prevent child internalizing problems to date, including studies reporting significant intervention effects extending up to 11 years post - intervention. Unlike the Cochrane review of group parenting programs which focused on interventions delivered in the first 3 years of the child's life (Barlow et al., 2010), we place d no restrictions on the intervention mode of delivery, and included a wider child age range. Employing a whole -of-childhood focus allowed us to examine whether there are periods of development when parenting interventions may be best targeted. The growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining parenting interventions enabled us to include only RCTs in this review, permitting meta -analyses of more rigorously -designed and higher -quality studies. By focusing only on parenting interventions that were directed primarily at parents (i.e. where parents received majority of the direct intervention), we were able to examine the question of whether directly intervening with parents (without any substantial direct intervention with the child) is sufficient to reduce risk for child internalizing outcomes. Unlike Siegenthaler and colleagues' review (2012) which focused on interventions involving mentally -ill parents of children without established mental disorders at the time of randomization into the RCT (selective or indicated prevention), our review had a broader scope in capturing universal, selective and indicated prevention, as well as secondary prevention of internalizing outcomes. We also conducted a series of supplementary and subgroup analyses to examine potential moderators of the effects found. However, a few limitations to our findings should be noted. Firstly, it was beyond the scope of the current review to examine mediators of the intervention effects found. As cogently argued by Sandler and colleagues (Sandler et al., 2011; Sandler et al., 2014), mediation analyses are required to identify the processes by which interventions have their effects, and the key components that must be preserved when interventions are disseminated (Teubert & Pinquart, 2011). Like many other Page 38 of 49 meta -analyses to date (Sandler et al., 2014), we could not adequately assess the quality of all included trials because of poor reporting, especially of allocation concealment and selective reporting of outcome measures. Overall, there were few studies judged to be at low risk of bias across the domains that were assessed, and therefore results should be interpreted cautiously. We also could not assess for moderation by intensity o r duration of intervention due to inadequate descriptions of this aspect of intervention programs in about one-third of included trials. Notably, programs varied widely from a few group sessions scheduled within 1-3 months, to multiple weekly home visits tapering off into less -frequent but ongoing interventions over a few years. The number of sessions actually delivered was even more poorly reported. We believe that it is at least partly due to such variability in program design, delivery and reporting that past meta -analyses have not found consistent associations between intensity of programs and effect sizes (Sandler et al., 2014; van Zoonen et al., 2014). We attempted to estimate intervention intensity by multiplying the number of intervention session s by the duration of each session, because sessions varied significantly between programs (e.g. 30 minutes to 3 hours), but one or both variables were inadequately reported in some trials. Clearly, such information is crucial for determining the costs and cost-effectiveness of preventive programs, and improved reporting is required in future studies. There also remains a need to clarify the dimensions along which implementation should be measured as predictors of outcome; e.g. dosage, fidelity, and qualit y of implementation (including training and supervision of those administering interventions) . Moreover, while 44% of included studies involved group sessions, many of these made the assumption that individual members of the group programs could be regarded as independent observations, without adequately controlling for or considering potential clustering effects. Furthermore, even in interventions involving individual sessions with an interventionist, many studies involved only one or very few interventionists, and fail to consider the potential interventionist clustering effects. Hence it is possible that clustering effects may have over - estimated the precision of the effect size estimates (by affecting the confidence inte rvals). This review examined a large number of potential moderators of intervention effects relative to the small Page 39 of 49 number of studies included, especially those examining depressive and anxiety outcomes; hence findings from the supplementary analyses should be regarded as primarily observational and hypothesis generating in nature. This review also could not draw firm conclusions about the long - term effects of parenting interventions in preventing incidence of anxiety or depression disorders, because too few studies assessed diagnostic outcomes. Finally, most included trials were conducted in English -speaking developed countries; hence our findings may not generalize to ethnic minorities or developing countries. Summary and conclusions This review of parenting interventions found evidence for very small to small mean change based on measures of internalizing, depressive, and anxiety symptoms but potentially significant long- term effects on clinical presentations of internalizing disorders, with more substantial effects based on measures of anxiety than depression. Although the size of effects found seem small in absolute terms, they are comparable to the effects of other preventive interventions, including those directed at young people themselves (Merry et al., 2011) or later in life (van Zoonen et al., 2014), and could have an important public health impact (Rose, 1992; Sandler et al., 2014). Importantly, the persistence of intervention effects suggests that these are real and not placebo effects. Most noteworthy are the findings involving measures of anxiety symptoms and diagnoses, which compare favourably to interventions targeted directly at young people themselves (Fisak et al., 2011; Teubert & Pinquart, 2011). Given the central role and involvement that parents have throughout most of young people's development, our findings underscore the likely benefits of increasing parental involvement in preventing and reducing internalizing problems in young people.
