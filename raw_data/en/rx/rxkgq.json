A Decision Tree Based serotype-specic assay a second-line test. Howe ver, in a low pre-test probability general hospital setting predicting goodresponders could be more valuable to reduce the number of samples needing serotyping. Methods: Serotype-specic PnPS antibody-assays were performed for suspected immunodeciency two Dutch general hospitals (Jeroen Bos ch Elisabeth Tweesteden Hospital, were subsequently performed in archived m aterial. Data were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and a greement indices (ICC). Results: Sera of 284 patients (348 samples) were included; 23-valent IgG-titres and the corresponding sum of PnPS-serotype specic antibod ies showed moderate correlation (ICC =0.63). In 232 conjugated-pneumococcal-vaccine-na\u00efve pat ients (270 samples), a random 23-valent IgG-titer could discrimi nate samples with or 6/9 pneumococcal serotypes when both cut-off values 1.0 \u00b5g/ml were used (AUC 0.86 and 0.92, respectively). All patients with a pre-immunization-titer and/or post-immunization-titer 96.1\u00b5g/ml and none with a post-immunization-titer 38.5\u00b5g/ml exhibited a good response to PnPS vaccination. Using these breakpoints as sc reening test to predictgoodresponders, only 24% of patients would require further sero typing, as opposed to 68% if breakpoints to predict poorresponders would have been used.Janssen al. Decision Tree Using 23-Valent Pneumococcal-IgG-Assay Conclusion: Inalowpre-testprobabilitysetting,the23-valentIgG-as sayprovedtobea reliable conjugated- pneumococcal-vaccine-na\u00efve patients,reducingtheoverallnumberofpatientsamplesne edingfurtherserotyping,thus reducing overall costs as the \"gold standard\" ( 1-4) for the evaluation of anti-polysaccharide antibody production capac ity inpatientswhoaresuspectedtohaveprimaryantibodydecienc y because of unexplained or recurrent (mainly respiratory) infections ( 4,5). However, serotype-specic PnPS testing is not widely available and is time consuming, labor intensive and expensive. Moreover, uniform reference values are not availa ble, andinterpretationisthereforechallenging( 6-10). Recent data has indicated that one-step measurement of the summated response to all 23 serotypes present in the polysaccharidepneumococcalvaccine(herecalled\"23-valen tIgG assay\") could be used as a screening test to reduce the overal l number of patient samples needing serotyping ( 11,12). This couldsignicantlyimproveeciencyandreduceoverallcost addition, this in-house o r easy- to-usecommercialkit,andthetestresultiseasytointerpre tbased on a single these advantages, the 23- valent IgG assay has been proposed to be used as a rst-line test to identify clear-cut poor responders, and the serotype-speci c assayasasecond-linetestforassessmentofthePnPSvaccin ation response in non-clear-cut cases only. In their tertiary-cen ter adult cohort ( n=62), Lopez et al. identied a cut-o value of 110\u00b5g/ml,whichwasconstantlyassociatedwithapoorresponse toPnPSvaccinationusingtheserotype-specicassay( 11). However, on a population basis \u2014i.e., in the context of a low pre-test probability setting\u2014a screening method that can reliably predict goodresponders could be of greater value. After all, many patients with recurrent infections do not hav e an immunodeciency. Or they suer from milder forms of hypogammaglobulinemia, such as selective anti-polysacchar ide antibody deciency (SPAD) only (or combinations with IgG- and/or IgA deciency), without signicantly decr eased total immunoglobulin levels. These patients generally presen t themselves in secondary care, where the pre-test probability for severe antibody deciency is inherently low. However, e ven milder hypogammaglobulinemia can lead to serious problems, requiringadequatemedicalattention( 14).Thesemilderpatients are often not recognized due to lack of available test facilit ies Abbreviations: AUC, area lysaccharide antibodydeciency.in secondary care, and reluctance to refer many patients to an immunologist. Easy, reliable selection of patients can cr eate supportforalowerscreeningthresholdforantibodydecienc yin patients with recurrent infections in secondary care. Ultima tely, this will help timely detection of all patients who do have an immunodeciency. Our study was designed to investigate the suitability of the one-step summated response test for thispurpose. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design Between February 2012 and December 2018, serotype-specic PnPS assays were performed on 348 blood samples in regular patient care, obtained from 284 patients who were analyzed for potential immunodeciency in two secondary centers in the Netherlands [Jeroen 's-Hertogenbosch (n=234), Elisabeth Tweesteden Hospital, Tilburg ( n=50)]. Of these, 78 samples were from 64 patients who were previously vaccinated with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (Pn-C). Lef pneumococcal IgG assays.

Test Methods The Clinical Reference Standard The IgG antibodies against PnPS were measured on a Luminex platform using a quantitative multiplex immunoassay Hospital, this serotype-specic assay was performed in the Department of Medical Immunology, UniversityMedical Center Utrecht,theNetherlands. Titers we re assessed against eleven serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) until February 2014, and thereafter against n ine serotypes (6B, 8, 9V, 14, 15B, 19F, 20, 23F, 33F). For the Elisabeth Tweesteden Hospital, this assay was performed in th e St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. In this laboratory, titers were assessed against thirteen serotype s (1, 3, 4, 6A, 6B, 18C, 19A, thes e samples ( n=132), 22 of the present in used:0.35 and 1.0\u00b5g/ml (based on protection against invasive infection and colonization, respectively) ( 10,16-19).

In 174/284 (61%) patients a blood sample was drawn 4-8 weeks after intramuscular vaccination withonedoseof23-valentPnPSvaccine(Pneumovax23;Merck, Sharp positive response to PnPS vaccinatio n was dened according to the guidelines of the laboratory ( 20, 21). Briefly, a good response to PnPS vaccination was dened by a post-immunization titer Pn- C vaccine. In Pn-C pre-vaccinated patients, the serotypes not present in the vaccine were evaluated (Utrecht; when vaccinat ed with Pn-C7, serotypes 1, 3, with Pn-C10 , serotypes 8, 15B, 20, 33F|Nieuwegein; when vaccinated C7, serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A; when vaccinated with Pn- C10,serotypes3,6A,19A).AccordingtotheUtrechtlaborator y's reference values, we corrected for age in these samples: for ag es 4-6 years, an abnormal result was dened as <50% of serotypes evaluated reaching an IgG titer of 1\u00b5g/ml. For age 6 years, an abnormal result was dened as <75% of serotypes evaluated reachinganIgGtiterof 1\u00b5g/ml.AccordingtotheNieuwegein laboratory's reference values, an abnormal result was den ed as <70% of serotypes evaluated reaching an IgG The Index Test Forthemeasurementofthe23-valentIgGtiter,theVaccZymeTM anti-PCP IgG ELISA Kit (The Binding Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom) with precoated microtiter plates was used accordingtothemanufacturer'sinstructions( 22,23).Absorption of interfering anti-cell polysaccharide (CPS) in this assay.

RESULTS Participants 127/284 (45%) patients were females, and the mean age at inclusion was 36.3 years (range 1.1-89.7). In 54 patients, two or more dierent samples were available, resulting in 348 samples with paired serotype-specic and 23-valent pneumococcal IgG titers available for patients previously immunized with Pn-C vaccine]. Of the 270 samples from patients not previously immunized with Pn- C vaccine, 194 were pre-immunization samples, 38 were 4- 8 weeks post-immunization samples, and 38 were >8 weeks post-immunization samples (mean duration after vaccination 33 months, range 15-70 months). Of the 78 samples from patients previously immunized with Pn-C vaccine, 63 were pre- immunization samples, 14 were 4-8 weeks post-immunization samples, and 1 was a >8 weeks post-immunization sample (28months). Test Results Inallsamplestakentogether,amoderatecorrelationbetween the sumoftheindividualPnPSserotypesandthe23-valentIgGtit er in the same sample was observed (ICC =0.65, 95% CI =0.57- 0.72,P<0.0001;Figure1A ).TheICCdidnotimprovewhenthe sum of a larger set of 22 individual PnPS serotypes was plotted against the 23-valent With Conjugated Pneumococcal Vaccine First, all samples from patients not previously immunized with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine were analyzed togethe r, irrespective of whether the patients had received PnPS- vaccination.

However, neither of them achieved estimatesofbothsensitivityandspecicity >86%(Table1). Next, the pre- and 4-8 weeks post-immunization 23-valent IgG measurements were compared with the serotype-specic FIGURE 1 | Correlation between the 23-valent pneumococcal IgG titer an d the sum of the serotype titers determined in the same sample ( individual serotypes, 348 samples, 95% CI=0.57-0.72, P<0.0001;B: of individual serotypes, 132 samples, ICC =0.64, 95% CI =0.49-0.75).PnPS vaccination response to perform a per patient analysis (information available for 147 patients). This is clinically t he most interesting evaluation. Sixty (41%) patients were dene d as poor responders according to the serotype-specic assay. For both 23-valent pre- and 4-8 weeks post-immunization titers a signicant dierence was observed between good and poor responders ( p<0.0001;Figure3). The results of ROC curve analysesofthe23-valentIgGassayperformancevs.theseroty pe- specic assay per patient are shown in Figure3 andTable2. Because Cohen's kappa was never better than moderate ( <0.75), this ruled out the use of the 23-valent IgG assay alone and implicated the necessity of a stepwise approach. We wanted to establish whether use of the 23-valent IgG assay alone could reliably discriminate good responders, who do not need any further diagnostic work-up, as well as poor responders, whom we do not want to miss. We therefore favored a high sensitivity for pre-immunization titers, and both high specicity as well as high sensitivity for post-immunization titers. All post-immunization titer patients with a post-immunization titer 38.5\u00b5g/ml exhibited a good response to PnPS vaccination ( Table2B). Based on these data, a stepwise approach was developed using both tests (Figure4). 24% (26/109) of patients had pneumococcal IgG titers serotypes above the cut-off values of 0.35 1.0 \u00b5g/ml(B).P-values were calculated in an unpaired t-test.

On average, antibodies to individual serotypes contributed to the total 23-valent IgG titer rangi ng from 1.1 to and 1.1 to 14.7% in post-immunization samples. In pre-immunization samples, serotype 14 contributed more to the 23-valent IgG titer compared to serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 23F (analysis of <0.0001). In post-immunization samples, no identied (analysis of variance; F=1.291, p=0.20). In 19 pre-immunization and 4 post-immunization samples, antibodies against a single serotype contributed more than 50% to the 23-valent IgG titer, but only two of those pre-immunization samples and none of those post- immunization samples had the serotypes 1.0\u00b5g/ml. A post-immunization sample was not available for this patient, therefore it was not possible to classify this patient as good or bad responder to PnPS vaccination. In the pre- immunization sample where serotype 14 was dominant (84% of the 23-valent IgG titer), an additional 7/9 serotypes had concentrations above both cut-o levels 0.35 and 1.0 \u00b5g/ml (this patient can be considered a good responder based on naturalexposure).Patients Previously Immunized With Conjugated Pneumococcal Vaccine First, all samples from patients who were previously immunized with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine were analyzed togethe r (n=78),irrespectiveofwhetherthepatientshadreceivedPnPS- titers were samples with2-3/4,2/3, or4/6 serotypes above both the cut- o levels of 0.35 and 1.0 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, compared to the samples with <2-3/4, <2/3, or <4/6 serotypes above these cut- o en samples with and without 2-3/4,2/3, or4/6 serotypes above both the ].

It is important to realize that recent studies focusin g on using this assay as a rst-line test were used to screen for poorresponders to PnPS vaccination in highly selected patient populationsreferredtotertiaryimmunodeciencyexpertcent ers (11,12). Both approaches are valuable, but each should be used intheappropriatesettingonly. We found that a cut-o value of 38.2\u00b5g/ml in pre- PnPS-immunization 23-valent IgG assay could reliably predi ct good responders in our cohort of conjugated-vaccine-na\u00efve patients. This cut-o value is higher than the lower limit of the normal range (10.0, 11.0, and 15.4 \u00b5g/ml), and just below the means (41.0, 45.8, and 59.5 \u00b5g/ml) found in three previous studies of healthy vaccine-na\u00efve adults using the same assa y as our study ( 13,26,27). na\u00efve patients. This cut-o value is below the lower limit of the normal range post-vaccination (50 and 77 \u00b5g/ml) found in 2 studies of healthy unvaccinated adults using the same assay as our study ( 28,29), and similar to the cut-o value (40\u00b5g/ml) used by the Utrecht group ( 12,22). It is also lower than found in a previous study by Lopez et al., were a 23- valent IgG titer of 110\u00b5g/ml yielded a specicity of and predicted 57% of the poor responders to PnPS vaccination ( 11). However, our data are not easily comparable to those of Lopez et al., as dierent sets and numbers of serotypes were tested in the serotype-specic assay, the criteria to dene a decien t response were dierent, and most important, they investigated ahighlyselectedpatientpopulationofwhich75%wasdiagnosed withahumoralimmunodeciency.Incontrast,goodresponder s predominated in our general population cohort. This again emphasizes the importance of tting the screening approach to theappropriatesetting. The performance of the IgG titers were similar in good and poor responders. This is in agreement with previous studies, in which it has been shown that the 23-valent IgG assay could not discriminate betweengood and poor responders to PnPS-vaccination in Pn-C pre- vaccinated patients ( 12,31). Since a majority of childhood vaccination programs now include Pn-C vaccination, and a 20- valentconjugatedvaccineiscurrentlyinvestigatedwitht heintent to broaden global protection against pneumococcal disease, th e future value of the 23-valent IgG assay as screening method for SPAD will probably become limited. Recent results show promising results for the measurement of the Typhim Vi IgG response as a diagnostic tool for assessing polysaccharid e productioninPn-Cpre-vaccinatedpatients( 32). The WHO recommended assay for measuring serotype- specic PnPS antibodies is by ELISA. A growing number of clinical laboratories, including ours, now are using multiple x bead technology for this purpose. The correlation between the twotypesofassaysisgood,althoughtherecanbevariationin the absoluteconcentrationsmeasured.Ithasbeenevaluatedwh ether this variation would aect response classication of patients whenusingpairedclinicalsera( 33).Itwasconcludedthatdespite variation in absolute values of pneumococcal antibodies, th e overall classication of the pneumococcal immune status of t he patient was remarkably similar between assays ( 33,34). In a recent publication it has been suggested to adjust multiplex cut - ovaluesofselectedpolysaccharidestoimproveagreementle vel withWHOELISA( 35). Our study has several limitations. First, a high 23-valent I gG titer corresponding with a good PnPS vaccination response by the serotype-specic assay may nevertheless not be protective because the antibody has low avidity or low opsonophagocytic activity. However, there are currently no accepted clinical criteria regarding normal PnPS-vaccination response based o n measurements other than serotype-specic PnPS concentration (3). For future studies, it would be interesting to compare the 23-valent IgG assay with functional opsonophagocytosis assay s. Second, the modest correlation between the 23-valent IgG ti ter and the sum of individual PnPS serotypes may be explained by theuseofserotype-specicresultsexpressedas\"higherthan\" (for example >10\u00b5g/ml). Determination of the exact concentration by titration of the sera, which has not been performed in this study, may result in a better agreement between both assays. It has long been recognized that the 23-valent IgG assay is of limited value in patients where isolated, elevated serotype t iters are responsible for a high 23-valent IgG titer. While this may be true for selected patient cohorts, in a general patient populatio n, suchasours,thisturnsoutnottobethecase.Inonlyfewsampl and only in 2/19 pre-immunization samples. Unfortunately, these two patients were not vaccinated , so it cannot be excluded that they could be incorrectly classi ed as \"expected to be a good responder\" by our decision tree. Last, it should be pointed out that in our per patient analysis, post- immunizationsamplesobtained Kit for Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 8 November 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2496Janssen et al. Decision Tree Using 23-Valent Pneumococcal-IgG-Assay predicting goodresponders to PnPS-vaccination in a general hospital patient population setting. We showed that this assay can be a rst screening test in Pn-C vaccine-na\u00efve patients to determine which patients in a general hospital setting do not need serotype-specic testing.
