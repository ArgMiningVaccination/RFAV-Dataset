Therefore, the association between immune nutrients and vaccine side effects needs to be investigated. Our aim was to analyze the relationship between vaccination side effects and supplement intake among the Italian population. The study included a questionnaire asking for personal data, anthropometric information, COVID-19 infection and immunity response, and COVID-19 vaccination and supplementation. The survey was conducted from 8 February to 15 June 2022. In the study, 776 respondents were included, aged between 18 and 86 (71.3% females). We observed a statistically significant correlation between supplement consumption and side effects at the end of the vaccination cycle (p = 0.000), which was also confirmed by logistic regression (p = 0.02). Significant associations were observed between supplement intake and side effects of diarrhea and nausea at the end of the vaccination cycle (p = 0.001; p = 0.04, respectively). Significant associations were observed between side effects and omega-3 and mineral supplementation at the start of the vaccination cycle (p = 0.02; p = 0.001, respectively), and between side effects and vitamin supplementation at the end of the vaccination cycle (p = 0.005). In conclusion, our study shows a positive impact of supplementation on vaccination response, increasing host immune defenses, and reducing side effects.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-04-07", "cleaned_text": "Effectiveness of Nutritional Supplements for Attenuating the Side Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15081807](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15081807) [Nutrition for the Prevention and Control of Chronic Degenerative Diseases and COVID-19]( /journal/nutrients/special_issues/32V8HW59FH )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-nutrients-15-01807)]. [2](#B2-nutrients-15-01807)]. [3](#B3-nutrients-15-01807)]. Some vaccines have been made using the same technology as vaccines currently in use; others have been made using new approaches [ [4](#B4-nutrients-15-01807)]. Studies on vaccines against COVID-19 started in spring 2020, and in less than one year, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has authorized the conditional marketing of a first messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, namely Comirnaty (BNT162b2), from the BioNTech/Pfizer company, and immediately after, a second one produced by Moderna, namely Spikevax. Like Comirnaty, the Spikevax (mRNA-1273) vaccine is based on mRNA technology. The latter encodes the spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The vaccine, therefore, does not introduce the virus into the cells but only the genetic information that the cell needs to build copies of the S protein [ [3](#B3-nutrients-15-01807), [5](#B5-nutrients-15-01807)]. Following the positive opinion of the EMA, in January 2021, the third COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria (ChAdOx1-S), developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, was authorized for marketing by the European Commission. Compared to the first two mRNA vaccines, Vaxzevria uses a different approach to induce the body's immune response to the S protein. It is a viral vector vaccine that uses a modified version of the chimpanzee adenovirus, which is no longer able to replicate, as a vector to provide instructions for synthesizing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Once produced, the protein can stimulate a specific immune response (both antibody and cellular) [ [5](#B5-nutrients-15-01807)]. Finally, on 11 March, 2021, the EMA recommended the granting of a conditional marketing authorization for the vaccine developed by the pharmaceutical company Janssen (Johnson & Johnson). It is a viral vector vaccine composed of a recombinant vector based on replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 suitably modified to contain the gene encoding the complete S protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a stabilized conformation (Ad26.COV2.S). [5](#B5-nutrients-15-01807), [6](#B6-nutrients-15-01807)]. Considering this, it became important immediately to identify, quantify, and evaluate all the risks related to the administration of individual vaccines, carrying out the appropriate risk-benefit analyses [ [7](#B7-nutrients-15-01807)]. Several studies have detected and analyzed post-vaccination symptoms, correlating them with the different types of vaccines and their mechanisms of action. The most frequent local adverse effects were pain, erythema, swelling, and lymphatic adenopathy, whereas the systemic ones were fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and chills [ [8](#B8-nutrients-15-01807)]. The least frequent but most serious adverse effects were instead lymphedema, myocarditis, Bell's palsy, respiratory distress, anaphylaxis, and thrombosis with syndrome [ [9](#B9-nutrients-15-01807)]. [10](#B10-nutrients-15-01807)]. On the contrary, an optimal nutritional status guarantees the modulation of inflammatory and oxidative processes related to the immune system, playing a fundamental role in counteracting bacterial and viral infections as well as being proven for SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [11](#B11-nutrients-15-01807)]. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that an increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection, severe disease, and death were directly associated with diet-associated inflammation [ [12](#B12-nutrients-15-01807)]. [11](#B11-nutrients-15-01807)]. Several studies are available from this point of view, so much so that recently, the key role that vitamins, such as vitamin A, B6, B12, C, D, E, K, and folate; microelements, such as zinc, iron, selenium, and copper; and nutrients, such as omega-3 (-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids, have in supporting innate and adaptive immune responses, have been extensively reviewed [ [13](#B13-nutrients-15-01807), [14](#B14-nutrients-15-01807), [15](#B15-nutrients-15-01807), [16](#B16-nutrients-15-01807), [17](#B17-nutrients-15-01807), [18](#B18-nutrients-15-01807)]. Preclinical and clinical studies support specific roles for dietary supplements containing them, especially regarding the maintenance of physical barriers in the skin, gastrointestinal, and respiratory tracts, as well as highlighting their key role in supporting cellular functionality in innate and adaptive responses [ [18](#B18-nutrients-15-01807)]. Moreover, probiotics such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli have a positive effect in modulating the dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal and pulmonary systems associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota, through the bidirectional intestine-lung axis, influences the health status of the lungs [ [11](#B11-nutrients-15-01807)]. In association with them, the integration of prebiotics is useful for modulating inflammation and promoting the growth of the intestinal microbiota, allowing an adequate immune response [ [19](#B19-nutrients-15-01807)]. 2. Materials and Methods [20](#B20-nutrients-15-01807)] started in April 2020 by the Section of Clinical Nutrition and Nutrigenomic, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention of the University of Rome Tor Vergata. [Appendix A](#app1-nutrients-15-01807). [20](#B20-nutrients-15-01807)]. Once completed, each questionnaire was transmitted to the Google platform, and the final database was downloaded as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Statistical Analysis 3. Results [21](#B21-nutrients-15-01807)] and an incidence in our sample equal to 77% (considering an alpha significance level of 5%), the minimum number of subjects to be enrolled from our analysis, we observed a statistically significant correlation between the presence of comorbidities and the worsening of COVID-19 symptoms (p = 0.03). We also observed a statistically significant correlation between age and comorbidities (p = 0.000). Although Wagner et al. [ [24](#B24-nutrients-15-01807)] observed how age can influence humoral and cellular immune responses after vaccination, we did not find significant correlations considering the variables age, vaccine side effects, and supplementation. [25](#B25-nutrients-15-01807)]. [26](#B26-nutrients-15-01807)]. [27](#B27-nutrients-15-01807)]. [28](#B28-nutrients-15-01807)]. [29](#B29-nutrients-15-01807)]. [30](#B30-nutrients-15-01807)], who observed that the immune response increases with the administration of vaccine doses. [31](#B31-nutrients-15-01807)], who noted how sex can influence innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to sex-specific outcomes even for infectious diseases and vaccines. [32](#B32-nutrients-15-01807)], but also for the immune response that follows vaccination [ [33](#B33-nutrients-15-01807)]. [34](#B34-nutrients-15-01807)], which plays a key role in the induction of oxidative stress [ [35](#B35-nutrients-15-01807)]. The complex crosstalk between ACE2 and redox pathways is further emphasized by possible bidirectional redox regulation of ACE2 levels. High ACE2 activity can reduce oxidative stress, but conversely, high redox can regulate ACE2 [ [36](#B36-nutrients-15-01807), [37](#B37-nutrients-15-01807), [38](#B38-nutrients-15-01807), [39](#B39-nutrients-15-01807)]. [19](#B19-nutrients-15-01807)], and creating barriers in the respiratory tract [ [33](#B33-nutrients-15-01807)]. Sharif et al. [ [40](#B40-nutrients-15-01807)] observed a significant association between vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc supplementation and reduced infection and severity of COVID-19 risk, as well as the duration of supplementation and medication being significantly associated with reduced hospitalization. [41](#B41-nutrients-15-01807), [42](#B42-nutrients-15-01807), [43](#B43-nutrients-15-01807)]. Additionally, it has been observed that high-dose vitamin C could lead to a reduction in mortality and an improvement in oxygen support status. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 patients can lead to a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, limiting the mortality associated with ARDS. Patients with deficiency were also observed to have an increased risk of pneumonia [ [44](#B44-nutrients-15-01807)]. [45](#B45-nutrients-15-01807)], who observed that vitamin A supplementation in children who had received the pentavalent vaccine leads to a reduction in fever and illness as side effects. [46](#B46-nutrients-15-01807)], the zinc biomarker could represent a good predictor of survival in COVID-19, highlighting that its supplementation is fundamental for convalescence in patients with deficiency. [33](#B33-nutrients-15-01807)], and, according to Hackler et al. [ [47](#B47-nutrients-15-01807)], the selenoprotein P biomarker could be a fundamental survival parameter in COVID-19, showing that its supplementation is relevant for the convalescence of deficient patients. [48](#B48-nutrients-15-01807)] observed that 1000 mg per day for 14 days of -3 administered to COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms led to an improvement in renal function. Additionally, Sedighiyan et al. [ [49](#B49-nutrients-15-01807)] noted an improvement in some symptoms of COVID-19 (including pain and fatigue) and a reduction in PCR and ESR levels after supplementation with 2000 mg daily for two weeks. [50](#B50-nutrients-15-01807)]. It has also been found that the microbiota can play a crucial role in modulating the immune system and improving or reducing the response to vaccines according to their composition [ [29](#B29-nutrients-15-01807)]. [51](#B51-nutrients-15-01807)]. Indeed, in the management of COVID-19, Bifidobacteria seem to promote the efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 [ [52](#B52-nutrients-15-01807)]. Merra et al. [ [53](#B53-nutrients-15-01807)] highlighted the importance of supplementation with probiotics of different compositions, depending on the nature of the dysbiosis, to positively influence the course of COVID-19. [54](#B54-nutrients-15-01807)], this is possibly related to their greater participation in social media and because they spend more time on the web and social networks informing themselves about aspects concerning their health compared to men [ [55](#B55-nutrients-15-01807)]. 5.
