The human rights experts that subscribe this document urge States to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination to all migrants regardless of nationality, migration status or other prohibited ground of discrimination and remind States of their international obligations on the right to health and non-discrimination. 1 CMW and UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, \"Joint Guidance Note on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Human Rights of Migrants\", 26 May 2020, page 2; OHCHR, \"COVID-19 and the Human Rights of Migrants: Guidance\", 7 April 2020; African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, \"449 Resolution on Human and Peoples' Rights as central pillar of successful response to COVID-19 and recovery from its socio-political impacts - ACH- PR/Res. 449 (LXVI) 2020\", 7 August 2020; and \"Resolution 470 on the Protection of Refugees, Asylum Seekers and Migrants in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa\", 3 December 2020; CoE's SRSG, \"Respecting democracy, rule of law and human rights in the framework of the COVID-19 sanitary crisis.

It has been recognized that given the scarcity of doses and the limited resources of many States, it is impossible to guarantee that everyone will have immediate access to a COVID-19 vaccine2. Consequently, in the short term, the prioritization of access to vaccines by specific groups is unavoidable at the national level. Before this scenario, States should prioritize people for vaccination on the basis of individual medical needs and public health grounds, by establishing appropriate criteria that are in line with human rights standards and norms.3 The prioritization of vaccines delivery should not exclude anyone on the basis of nationality and migration status. In the context of establishing criteria for vaccines prioritization, attention must be given to those migrants who are most exposed and vulnerable to the SARS-COV-2 due to social determinants of health, such as migrants in irregular situations, low-income migrants, migrants living in camps or unsafe conditions, in immigration detention, migrants in transit. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants has established that \"a number of reports indicate that migrants may be more vulnerable to Joint Guidance Note on Equitable Access to COVID-19 Vaccines for All Migrantspoor health by virtue of their often low socio-economic status, the process of migration and their vulnerability as non-nationals in the new country\"4. The priorization of those migrants who are most exposed and vulnerable to the SARS- COV-2 due to social determinants of health was recently supported by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR)5 and the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization of the World Health Organization6. Migrants and their families face a range of obstacles in accessing a COVID-19 vaccination, including lack of access to information in a language they understand, costs, and legal, administrative and practical barriers. In the absence of effective firewalls between health and public services and immigration authorities, data collection and information sharing related to COVID-19 vaccinations may also further raise fears among migrants in an irregular situation. In situations of fear and uncertainty, such as the current pandemic, migrants and minorities associated with migration can be particularly vulnerable to attitudes and behaviours that stigmatize and scapegoat them. Discriminatory public discourses may lead to the exclusion of migrants and fail the efforts to protect the whole population at large. All migrants must have access to the vaccine regardless of their nationality and migration status and on an equal basis with nationals. As the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights held: \"ensuring access to the vaccine is not only the right thing to do, it is in the interest of us all, for unless everyone is safe, no one is safe\"7. If States decide not to comply with their international obligations leaving migrants and other marginalised groups without access to the vaccine, the risk of upsurges in the pandemic remains not only for those States but to all the world population.

Health is a fundamental human right indispensable for the exercise of other human rights8, recognized in numerous international instruments9. It includes the obligation to provide, without discrimination, immunization against major infectious diseases as a means to prevent, treat and control epidemic and other diseases10. Accordingly, the CESCR has interpreted the obligation of provision of immunization against major infectious diseases occurring in the community and measures to prevent epidemic diseases as obligations of \"comparable priority\" with the core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of the right to health11. Therefore, access to the vaccination is a human right12. States have the obligation to ensure the right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalised groups13 , as interpreted by the CMW14 and the CESCR15. The CMW has held that article 28 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families must be read together with article 12 of the ICESCR. States have a duty to respect the right to health by ensuring that migrants have equal access to COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of their nationality and migration status. In light of all of the above, the UN Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of Joint Guidance Note on Equitable Access to COVID-19 Vaccines for All Migrantsmigrants, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur on Refugees, Asylum Seekers, Internally Displaced Persons and Migrant in Africa of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Migration and Refugees of the Council of Europe and the Rapporteur on the Rights of Migrants of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights urge States to: Joint Guidance Note on Equitable Access to COVID-19 Vaccines for All Migrants Provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination for all migrants and their families on a non-discriminatory basis, regardless of their nationality and migration status. Ensure that vaccine prioritization within countries takes into account the vulnerabilities, risks and needs of those migrants who are most exposed and vulnerable to the SARS-COV-2. Adopt measures to overcome barriers, establish protocols that facilitate equitable access to vaccination for migrants, including those in irregular situations, and provide targeted outreach and provision of information among migrants in a language they understand and in formats they can access. Enact firewalls between immigration enforcement and the provision of COVID-19 vaccination, in order to prevent fear or risk of reporting, detention, deportation and other penalties as result of migration status. Vaccine registration should not be used to collect nor share information about migration status. Communication messages and public information campaigns should make clear that migrants in irregular situations will not be penalized or targeted for immigration enforcement when seeking access to COVID-19 vaccination. Avoid rhetoric and terminology that stigmatize and reinforce harmful narratives against migrants that may result in the exclusion of migrants and those in irregular situations from the public health response. Ensure public information and rhetoric regarding public health is inclusive of migrants. Develop coordinated strategies and mechanisms of cooperation and assistance to guarantee universal and equitable access to vaccines for COVID-19 globally, and to take into special consideration those countries which due to economic or financial factors are facing obstacles to get vaccines for their populations, including migrants and their families.
