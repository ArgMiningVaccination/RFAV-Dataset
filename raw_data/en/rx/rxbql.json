The vision is supported by a range of strategic plans that identify objectives for the organisation. There is recognition that the demand for health services is increasing every year. New health technologies, higher consumer expectations, an ageing population and a growing consumer base all contribute to this demand. The Corporate Plan articulates: key focus areas priority areas for improvement key strategies for achieving priorities achievements planned for the long term, which is defined as being five years. In 2016-17, ACT Health continued to measure its performance against these areas through: key performance measures identified in the ACT Public Health Service's quarterly performance report ACT Health's strategic and accountability indicator sets in the ACT Budget Papers. SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE ACT Health continued to perform well against a range of Health Directorate and ACT Local Hospital Network (ACT LHN) strategic objectives and priorities over the reporting period, as discussed below. Health Directorate strategic indicators The ACT continues to enjoy the highest life expectancy of any jurisdiction in Australia. Life expectancy at birth is: 85.2 years for females in the ACT, against a national average of 84.4 years 81.4 years for males, against a national average o f 80.3 years. During 2016-17, ACT public hospitals: performed 12,826 elective surgery procedures, exceeding the target of 12,500 assessed 100 per cent of emergency dental clients within 24 hours For radiotherapy, 100 per cent of emergency, 84 per cent of palliative and 86 per cent of radical radiotherapy patients commenced treatment within targeted time frames. The performances for palliative and radical patients improved during 2016-17 when compared to 2015-16. Despite a comprehensive recruitment and promotion program, breast screening participation for the 50-69 years cohort in the ACT has remained steady at 56 per cent against the ACT target of 60 per cent. However, for the twoyear Cervical Screening Program participation rate, the ACT achieved a result of 57.9 per cent, which is on par with the national average. Public mental health services were effective in providing appropriate care to mental health clients, with only 9.7 per cent of clients returning to hospital within 28 days of discharge from an ACT public acute psychiatric unit following an acute episode of care. This is in line with the target of 10 per cent. 37 However, during 2016-17, the proportion of mental health clients who were subject to a seclusion episode while being an admitted patient in an ACT public mental health inpatient unit was one per cent higher that the local target of less than three per cent. The higher than expected result is due to the opening of Dhulwa this year, which resulted in a new cohort of patients not previously captured in ACT Health seclusion data. This is a small cohort of patients, so a small increase in the raw number causes a significant increase in percentage. ACT public hospitals achieved a mean bed occupancy rate of 86 per cent in 2016-17, below the target of 90 per cent. The proportion of the ACT population with some form of: cardiovascular disease is 3.7 per cent, which is lower than the national proportion of 5.2 per cent diabetes is 4.3 per cent, which is consistent with the national proportion of 5.1 per cent. The immunisation coverage rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children continue to improve but remain lower than the coverage rates for the general community. The coverage rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 24-27 months, 60-63 months a nd for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children has increased by three, two and one per cent respectively since 2015-16. The 2014 dfmt/DMFT index results at six years and 12 years were lower than the national average for the dfmt/DMFT index. The 2015-16 ACT rate of admissions in persons aged 75 years and over with a fractured neck of femur was above the longterm target of 5.3 per 1,000 persons. While this rate has fluctuated between 5.5 and 7.0 over a sevenyear period (2009-10 to 2015-16), there is a generally decreasing trend. In 2014, 5.2 per cent of students were current smokers, indicating a continued reduction in the youth smoking rate since 2002. ACT Health's performance against Health Directorate strategic objectives and priorities for the reporting period is discussed in detail in B.2 Performance analysis, page 72. ACT Local Hospital Network st rategic objectives and indicators The ACT Local Hospital Network (ACT LHN) consists of a networked system that includes: Canberra Hospital and Health Services Calvary Public Hospital Clare Holland House Queen Elizabeth II Family Centre. The ACT LHN has a yearly Service Level Agreement (SLA) which sets out the delivery of public hospital services and is agreed between the ACT Minister for Health a nd the Director General of the ACT LHN. When compared to 2015-16, the percentage of elective surgery cases admitted on time improved. The target for semi urgent cases was exceeded. ACT Emergency Departments achieved the target for \"seen on time\" category five patients and was consistent with the target for category one. Canberra Hospital's Emergency Department is reviewing its processes in relation to the discharge stream in the Emergency Department, the admission to ward process and patient discharge from the hospital inpatient setting. 37 36 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 ENVIRONMENT AND THE PLANNING FRAMEWORK ACT Health's vision is 'Your Health - Our Priority'.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-1738 38 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 The proportion of Emergency Department patients who stayed less than four hours from arrival to either admission or departure increased. The full year result of 73 per cent is an eight per cent improvement on the previous year. Since 2011-12, the performance has improved by 15 per cent. Both Canberra and Calvary Public Hospitals: continued to perform better than the target rate for unplanned hospital admissions within 28 days of discharge recorded rates well below the 2016-17 targets for SAB infections acquired while hospitalised continued to perform better than the 2016-17 hand hygiene rate targets. The ACT LHN's performance against ACT LHNspecific strategic objectives and priorities over the reporting period is discussed B.2 Performance analysis, page 72. Future directions The ACT Government is committed to providing data that accurately reflects the demand for and performance of, the services that are provided in our hospitals, health care facilities and throughout our programs. In February 2017, Health and Wellbeing Minister Meegan Fitzharris ordered a review into ACT Health's data collection in relation to performance metrics, following concerns raised around the integrity of the data. This review is ongoing and is expected to be completed by mid2018. The review will examine the structure of the department responsible for data governance, undertake integrity validation checks and develop a formal process for amendments to reporting. OUTLOOK FOR 2017-18 2017-18 will be another pivotal year for ACT Health, as it continues its efforts to move to a new level of health service delivery to better meet the needs of the Canberra community in the future. While ACT Health remains committed to its core values of care, excellence, collaboration and integrity, we will continue to explore new opportunities for innovation, efficiency and sustainability, while delivering on the ACT Government's priorities. ACT Health has been engaged in a comprehensive reform program, which will continue into 2017-18. This reform seeks to improve the efficiency and quality of publicly funded health services within the ACT. It will progress strategies in alignment with the seven key themes for ACT Health: Access Quality Sustainability and Innovation Strategic Partnerships Infrastructure Workforce Culture and Mental Health. Another focus for 2017-18 will be to continue the planning work for territorywide health services. This includes developing a Territorywide Health Services Framework, which will provide the strategic framework for t he planning and delivery of territorywide health services over the next decade. The framework will guide the establishment of clinical Centres to provide patients with integrated health care. 39 The Centres, which will be Territorywide, will ensure speciality services are integrated across the continuum of care (prevention in the community, care in the hospital and then management of care back in the community) to make it easier for patients to navigate the services they need. The ACT Health Systemwide Review of Data and Reporting will also continue throughout the year. Improving the quality of health care will continue to be a key priority for 2017-18, with the development of a fiveyear Quality Strategy for ACT Health. This strategy will provide the framework for setting out a portfolio of strategic projects known to: improve the quality and safety of care reduce unnecessary variation, waste and harm. Other strategic and operational initiatives to be pursued in 2017-18 include: providing $16.1 million in funding to ensure the University of Canberra Public Hospital (UCPH): is operationally ready provides excellent patient care experiences in a safe and secure environment undertaking planning work for the expansion of the Hospital in the Home program establishing a nurseled WalkinCentre (WiC) for the Gungahlin community undertaking scoping work for a new WiC in the Weston Creek region providing funding for prevention and detection services, such as: $0.7 million for free vaccinations to protect babies from preventable diseases $2.7 million for health checks for year seven students $4 million for preventative health measures improving access to dental services, including providing almost $3.2 million to provide two extra mobile dental clinics providing $2.7 million to establish a new clinical school for nursing, midwifery and allied health staff in conjunction with the Faculty of Health at the University of Canberra supporting new or expanded bulk billing general practices with over $1 million in grants over the next three years. A significant infrastructure program will also be progressed during the year, including: conducting a feasibility study and developing an early forward design for the Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre, which is to be built at the Canberra Hospital expanding the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children expanding northside hospital facilities providing $17.3 million to refurbish and upgrade the Acute Aged Care and Oncology wards at Canberra Hospital to: enhance patient safety and care improve the quality of inpatient services providing $12.1 million for a new purposebuilt facility for Aboriginal Community Health Services. STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL INITIATIVES TO BE PURSUED IN 2017-18 WILL EXPAND THE HEALTH SERVICES AVAILABLE TO CANBERRANS. INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS WILL EXPAND AND UPGRADE HEALTH FACILITIES. 39 38 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 The proportion of Emergency Department patients who stayed less than four hours from arrival to either admission or departure increased.

Patient flow process improvement During 2016-17, ACT Health implemented two key initiatives aimed at improving the movement of patients through CHHS: the Early Discharge Planning Program Electronic Patient Journey Boards (EPJBs). ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-1746 46 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 The Early Discharge Planning Program provides patient discharge education to all ward areas and asks staff to use the '6 Ps' of discharge to improve the patient journey through the hospital. The 6 Ps are: Planned Discharge Date, which focuses the multidisciplinary care team on determining a target date for discharge. Patient , which focuses on informing the patient of the discharge date to set a realistic expectation. Prioritise, which specifies that the ward round discharge patients first, to enable patients to leave the hospital as early as possible on the day of discharge. Pharmacy, which ensures that any discharge script is provided to the hospital pharmacy the evening before discharge so that medications are ready early the following day. Pathology , which ensures discharge pathology is prioritised for the first round of the morning. Paperwork , which focuses on completing the discharge summary during the patient's stay in hospital, so that it is ready on the morning of discharge. EPJBs have now been installed in all patient care areas. The boards display the status of key steps in the patient's journey, to enable better coordination of patient care by ward leaders and multidisciplinary team members. Emergency Department timeliness In 2016-17, the Heal th Directorate undertook significant reform of Canberra Hospital's Emergency Department to improve timeliness and access to emergency health care, while simultaneously being significantly refurbished. A threetiered approach was used to build a facility that is future proofed and that meets the demands of the changing population, while retaining the focus on highquality care. The areas of focus were targeted towards: Infrastructure: the major components of the $23 million expansion of Canberra Hospital Emergency Department have been completed. The new facility has an increased capacity by more than a third. A dedicated paediatric waiting and treatment area has been purposebuilt to meet the needs of the youngest members of our community. This is part of the ACT Government's $900 million Health Infrastructure Program that is changing the way health services are being delivered in the Territory. Staffing: given the Emergency Department expansion, the department has recruited additional staff to continue to deliver timely access to emergency health care. Reforms: significant changes in processes and work practices have been made to allow staff to operate as efficiently and effectively as possible. The Emergency Department Navigator is operational and has improved the patient journey through the Emergency Department by coordinati ng and supporting patient flow from the triage points to leaving the Emergency Department. Teambased care is another major change that supports the nursing, allied health and medical staff to work collaboratively to ensure that patients are receiving timely highquality emergency assessment and treatment. Access to expanded services In early 2017, the Medical Assessment and Planning Unit (MAPU) and General Medical Unit (GMU) consolidated into a single General Medicine Model of Care (MoC). This has provided an expanded consulting service across the hospital for patients with multiple active medical issues, who would benefit from a General Practitioner (GP) consultation. The aim of this model is to optimise the patient experience for patients with complex needs by: securing optimal clinical outcomes reducing avoidable delays 47 improving care coordination. Also in early 2017, Canberra Hospital established a Geriatric Assessment and Planning Unit, within the Division of Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care. The unit consists of six beds, which are dedicated to the comprehensive assessment of unstable elderly patients by a dedicated team. The assessment ensures: early clarification of treatment goals timely identification of appropriate care and pathways. In mid2017, a trial of a publicly funded homebirth program commenced for women at low risk of obstetric complications. The threeyear trial is being delivered through the Canberra Midwifery Program and is available to eligible women who reside within a 30 minute round trip to the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, as defined by the ACT Ambulance Service. Eligibility criteria for the trial are based on general and clinical guidelines with continuous risk assessment conducted throughout pregnancy and labour. The trial will provide one or two homebirths per month over the threeyear period, up to 24 births per year. Over the last several years, Canberra Hospital has been working to implement the elements required for a verified Trauma Service for the ACT and surrounding region. A new MoC was agreed in 2017. In 1 2 months, the verification process to complete registration as a Trauma Centre will be underway. The aim of the new trauma MoC is to enhance timely access to effective, efficient and flexible trauma care. This unit is responsible for the care coordination and treatment of trauma and emergency surgery patients. In the area of mental health care, ACT Health commissioned Dhulwa, the secure mental health unit, which was officially opened in November 2016. Dhulwa provides 24hour treatment and care for adults with complex mental health needs that cannot be met elsewhere in the Canberra region. Ten acute beds were opened in the first phase and a further 15 rehabilitation beds will open in future stages. The facility is a hightechnology security complex with 24hour monitoring. It focuses on providing a safe environment without compromising therapeutic elements. Dhulwa gives people opportunities to develop their skills and interests, which is vital to the rehabilitation process, including: gardening exercise social and cultural activities arts and music hobbies vocational activities. In addition to Dhulwa, ACT Health increased the number of funded beds in the Adult Mental Health Unit at Canberra Hospital to 37. This expands access to acute me ntal health services. In 2017, ACT Health also delivered an additional intensive care bed. Access to palliative care for inpatients expanded, with additional medical staff employed to support improved palliative care in Canberra hospitals. Outlook for 2017-18 ACT Health continues to review where and how surgery is delivered in the ACT, to ensure that patients are receiving their surgery in the right facility at the right time. Surgical resources are now managed through the Territory Wide Surgical Management Committee (TWSMC), which has representatives from Calvary and Canberra Hospitals. The committee monitors Elective Surgery Wait List performance across the Territory 47 46 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 The Early Discharge Planning Program provides patient discharge education to all ward areas and asks staff to use the '6 Ps' of discharge to improve the patient journey through the hospital.

The TWSMC has adopted strategies to continue to manage timeliness of surgical access into the future. Building on the success of the ACT's first Mobile Dental Clinics (MDCs), which have been operational since 2016, additional funding has been provided to source additional MDCs. These will be used to expand the availability of dental services to people who find it difficult to attend dental services in the traditional clinic setting. Stakeholder engagement is underway to determine where this type of service would provide the most benefit. Additional MDCs are expected to be operational in late 2018. In 2017-18, the Division of Surgery and Oral Health will be working closely with the Obesity Management Service (OMS) to provide bariatric surgery to public patients who meet the eligibility criteria. This service has been a long awaited development for the ACT community and will provide a clinical pathway for patients waiting to access a potentially lifechanging procedure. Longterm studies have shown that weight reduction surgery can have an impact not only on a person's weight but also on other significant co morbidities, such as: diabetes obstructive sleep apnoea cardiovascular disease. The Division o f Surgery and Oral Health has procured the necessary equipment and resources in order to commence the first procedures in early 2017. The aim is to provide 50 procedures per year. Three of the ACT's General Surgeons will be working with the multidisciplinary OMS team to ensure that clients are supported and guided through the care pathway for bariatric surgery. The OMS provides people with: support from a dietician and a psychologist as part of the multidisciplinary team ongoing care coordination, which can involve a GP. This approach maximises the benefits and health outcomes for the person by: providing ongoing monitoring of nutritional status preventing nutritional deficiencies maximising longterm weight loss. The Division of Medicine is in the process of phasing in a Spinal Pain Service. The service aims to use a multidisciplinary approach during early initial intervention to reduce longterm health concerns. The service will: be community based assist in reducing the wait time for patients already on some surgical and medical waitlists streamline the flow of patients who present with nonsurgical spinal pain through the Emergency Department. Providing nocturnal haemodialysis at the Belconnen Dialysis Centre is in the final stages of pla nning. This service will allow patients to have dialysis for longer, up to eight hours overnight, leading to better health outcomes. Appropriate patients are currently being identified and invited to participate. The ACT Government has committed additional funding in 2017-18 to expand the Hospital in the Home (HITH) service. The Division of Medicine will undertake a detailed review and assessment of the options available for the service, which is currently provided at both Canberra and Calvary Hospitals. Providing expanded access to HITH will benefit the broader health system, by keeping patients in their own homes, where possible and avoiding unnecessary traditional admissions. 49 The ACT Government has also committed additional funding in 2017-18 to improve stroke services. Endovascular clot retrieval (ECR) is now the accepted standard of care for selected patients with acute ischaemic stroke. It increases the likelihood of a good outcome for the patient, following acute ischaemic stroke. The ECR service will deliver timely assessment and treatment using a coordinated network comprising teams from Canberra and Calvary Hospitals. The ECR service will commence mid2017. In addition, ACT Health will progress the Territorywide rollout of the Stroke Followup Program. This program can potentially expand the postdischarge care for stroke patients by: providing them with information and advice connecting them to the services they require for recovery. It involves ACT Health working collaboratively with the Stroke Foundation to support ACT stroke survivors and their families as they are discharged home from hospital. Canberra Hospital has established a Cardiac Electrophysiology (EP) Service in the ACT. The service is delivered through an existing cardiac catheterisation laboratory. This new service: consolidates service delivery for patients with cardiac rhythm disorders ensures timely assessment and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias at Canberra Hospital ensures evidencebased and best practice care for the co mmunity is adopted improves healthcare and patient safety outcomes. The service commenced in October 2017. Palliative care services will continue to expand with the introduction of a paediatric palliative care nurse to address the needs of children and young adolescents in the ACT. A MoC for this service has been developed following broad consultation. Recruitment activities commenced in mid2017. The ACT Government has committed additional funding in 2017-18 for two new WalkinCentres (WiCs), to be located in Gungahlin and Weston Creek. WiCs provide additional access to healthcare in an extended hours setting, for people with nonurgent needs who do not want to visit the Emergency Department. $36 million in new funding has been committed to increase nursing numbers and training opportunities in the ACT. The additional funding will be rolled out over four years and includes: a scholarship and training partnership with the University of Canberra new maternal and child health nurses an increase in the number of graduate nurses to be employed each year six additional roving school nurses. Twelve new nurse navigators will support the care needs of patients with complex health conditions. An additional commitment is to increase frontline nursing staff num bers. This will improve services provided in hospitals and in the community, by: expanding HITH providing more outpatient numbers reviewing current ACT Health outpatient and communitybased services implementing incentives to raise nurse qualifications and career development opportunities. 49 48 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 and has the capacity to recruit resources where needed.

The ACT Government has committed additional funding in 2017-18 for two new WalkinCentres (WiCs), to be located in Gungahlin and Weston Creek. WiCs provide additional access to healthcare in an extended hours setting, for people with nonurgent needs who do not want to visit the Emergency Department. $36 million in new funding has been committed to increase nursing numbers and training opportunities in the ACT. The additional funding will be rolled out over four years and includes: a scholarship and training partnership with the University of Canberra new maternal and child health nurses an increase in the number of graduate nurses to be employed each year six additional roving school nurses. Twelve new nurse navigators will support the care needs of patients with complex health conditions. An additional commitment is to increase frontline nursing staff numbers. This will i mprove services provided in hospitals and in the community, by: expanding HITH providing more outpatient numbers reviewing current ACT Health outpatient and communitybased services implementing incentives to raise nurse qualifications and career development opportunities. ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-1750 50 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 The expansion of HITH will include an additional 25 nurses and three doctors. This will allow the service to be delivered in: community health centres Canberra and Calvary hospitals patients' homes. ACT Health estimates that this will allow more patients to receive care in their home or community health centre, rather than in hospital. Stakeholder consultation about the expansion of HITH is underway. In the area of mental health care, the ACT Government has announced significant investments for new and expanded services, including: new suicide prevention programs increased support for new and expectant parents and people affected by pre and post natal depression additional school psychologists to augment the mental health and wellbeing support provided by our community based counselling services for children and young people implementing a streamlined referral process that can be used by all schools when a student who could benefit from mental health services is identified.

Changes to the tobacco/smoke free legislation to regulate personal vaporisers (ecigarettes), came into force in August 2016. The Public Health Amendment Act 2016 passed and commenced in August 2016. The first action using the new powers was taken in December 2016. This amendment improved the HPS's ability to deal with insanitary conditions associated with severe hoarding matters. The HPS responded to various public health risks during the first half of 2017, including: a large food poisoning outbreak in February 2017 potential lead exposure issues involving two childcare centres in May 2017. The 2017 Multicultural Festival ran successfully. Before the event, the HPS conducted food safety information sessions with organisers and stall holders. The service also ran a number of food information sessions to engage with food businesses. These were well attended and were run in conjunction with the Canberra Business Chamber and the Australia and New Zealand Implementation Subcommittee for Food Regulation (ISFR). In August 2016, changes to the Medicines, Poisons a nd Therapeutic Goods Regulation 2008 were introduced to create a more effective and workable regulatory framework for prescribing controlled medicines. This framework is underpinned by the Controlled Medicines Prescribing Standards and aims to reduce: harms to the ACT community associated with the abuse, misuse and diversion of controlled medicines 59 regulatory burden on doctors and pharmacists. Issues and challenges During 2016-17, the ACT Government has committed to reducing barriers to registering for organ and tissue donation. While Canberra has one of the highest per capita organ donation registration rates in Australia, an ambitious target of achieving 90 per cent donation registration in Canberra has been set. OCHO continues to work with government to: develop a coordinated and consistent approach to organ and tissue donation facilitate effective and efficient organ donation for transplants. Outlook for 2017-18 In accordance with the ACT Government's 2016 election commitment, a priority in the coming year will be developing a comprehensive Preventative Health Strategy. The strategy will promote healthy choices and behaviours, with a focus on addressing the risk factors of: smoking harmful alcohol consumption obesity poor nutrition physical inactivity. A $4 million funding pool will be established to deliver prevention initiatives. The Population Health Protection and Prevention Division will participate in the 2017 National Gene Technology Review. Under the Gene Technology Agreement, all state, territory and Commonwealth legislation that comprise the Gene Technology Scheme are reviewed every five years. The Division will take the lead for developing appropriate amendments to ACT legislation to ensure it is consiste nt with the national scheme. Climate change impacts health both directly and indirectly. The Population Health Protection and Prevention Division is participating in multiple interjurisdictional and interagency discussions about improving health outcomes in the face of climate change. Examples include: monitoring air quality increasing community resilience to extreme heat improving fitness by encouraging active transport options that reduce carbon emissions. OCHO has been tasked with establishing a working group to examine the broader public health, legal and social issues related to potentially introducing drugrelated harm reduction services in the ACT, including drug checking. As various inquiries into drug checking and other harm reduction services progress, new issues will need to be considered. The current significant consultation and policy work will continue. The HPS has completed the draft ACT Hoarding Code of Practice 2017 (Code of Practice) made under the Public Health Act 1997 . The Code of Practice aims to provide a flexible framework to allow government to better respond to the public health risks caused by insanitary conditions. The Code of Practice will ensure a consistent approach to dealing with insanitary conditions due to hoardinglike behaviour.

The Australian National University's (ANU's) National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (NCEPH) was contracted initially in 2014-15 to conduct an ACT Asbestos Health Study to better understand the risk of developing mesothelioma from living in a house containing loosefill asbestos (a 'Mr Fluffy' house). The study had four components: a descriptive analysis, which was completed in July 2015 a focus group study, which was completed in February 2016 a survey of former/recent residents, which was completed in December 2016 a datalinkage exercise, which linked a number of data sets to estimate the risk of developing mesothelioma in current and former residents of affected houses compared with the general population and was completed in June 2017. The project was overseen by the ACT Asbestos Health Study Steering Committee, which included representatives from: NCEPH ACT Health the Asbestos Response Taskforce NSW Health other experts as required. The Gene Technology Act 2003 (ACT) was amended to align it with the 2015 amendments to the Commonwealth Gene Technology Act 2000 . The amendments will ensure that the ACT Government meets its obligations under th e Gene Technology Agreement and enhances the administrative efficiency of the Gene Technology Scheme.

The team will also evaluate the NonGovernment Organisation (NGO) community engagement model, which has been operating for three years. PATIENT EXPERIENCE Achievements Distribution of the Patient Experience inpatient survey began in March 2016. The survey collects information verbally or in writing from patients who have recently been discharged from Canberra Hospital. This feedback is being used to identify areas where ACT Health needs to improve services and those where we have met or exceeded our patients' expectations. It also offers opportunities to contribute unique ideas for service improvements. To date, surveys have been collected from 749 patients. Contact details: For more information, contact the Patient Experience Survey Coordinator via email at PtExpSurveys@act.gov.au or phone 02 6174 8190. Outlook for 2017-18 To ensure that feedback from the culturally and linguistically diverse communities is captured, the Quality, Governance and Risk Division will collaborate with the Multicultural and Diversity Health Policy Unit. The inpatient survey is been translated into Mandarin to test the nonEnglish speaking methodology. This is to build capacity to seek feedback from all consumers who access ACT Health's s ervices to ensure they have input into our services. Surveys are also being developed for community, hospital outpatient and paediatric settings, primarily using digital data collection methods. Testing of the digital devices will commence shortly. QUALITY IN HEALTHCARE ACT AWARDS Achievements The Quality in Healthcare ACT Awards 2017 contribute to ongoing improvements in the quality and safety of care provided, by highlighting the dedication of individuals and teams who make significant positive impacts in the health sector.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-1770 70 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 CORPORATE AND OPERATIONAL PLANS Population Health Division Strategic Framework 2013-2017 The Population Health Division Strategic Framework 2013-2017 verifies the role of Population Health Protection and Prevention Division within the broader context of preventive health efforts in the ACT. The framework identifies strategic objectives for the Division to meet in improving the health of the ACT. ACT and Southern NSW Local Health Di strict Cancer Services Plan 2015-2020 The ACT and Southern NSW Local Health District Cancer Services Plan 2015-2020 acknowledges the need for close collaboration between the ACT and Southern NSW Local Health District (SNSWLHD) health services when planning cancer services for the region's population. The plan: provides overarching strategic direction for cancer services across both the ACT and SNSWLHD highlights the need to work collaboratively to provide personcentred care that is equitable and timely recognises that the number of people needing cancer treatments in the Southern NSW (SNSW) region is expected to grow significantly, which reflects an ageing demographic and that this is a very important part of our health service planning builds on Australia's very strong role in recognising that a fully comprehensive approach to cancer control needs to consider the role of primary and secondary prevention addresses that with improvements in the science of cancer, ACT Health needs clinicians who are skilled at dealing w ith the human dimensions of care and that this is crucial area of workforce capability. In addition, the plan addresses the requirement for modern cancer services to have strong linkages between disciplines such as: research, an area in which Canberra Hospital has had a great success cancer service clinicians, e.g. Medical Oncology clinical trials in new cancer therapeutics. The role of ACT Health in developing a nationallevel centre of excellence in cancer services at Canberra Hospital is pivotal to delivering the plan, whereby: the Canberra Hospital service functions as the main tertiary Oncology referral service for the region and provides the leadership and support required in regional areas clinicians in SNSW hospitals deliver considerable cancerrelated care, e.g. surgery, medical oncology day centres and palliative care. ACT Palliative Care Services Plan 2013-2017 The ACT Palliative Care Services Plan 2013-2017 identified six goals for the ongoing development of palliative care services in the ACT. This model ensures that care is delivered at the right time, in the right place and by the right person by: confirming roles and responsibilities in the system establishing service flows managing demand developing the workforce. The ACT Palliative Care Clinical Network was established to, among other t hings, implement the plan. 71 The model is considered to be a tool that is designed to drive system change. To do this effectively, it is critical to: define the implementation and management processes and the governance of these processes identify the resources required to support its implementation. Subsequently, ACT Health funded the development of a 'Roadmap for Implementation' to give effect to the model and provide a timeframe and sequence to its implementation. The roadmap was completed and accepted by the ACT Palliative Care Clinical Network at its December 2016 meeting. The roadmap provides a fiveyear plan for rolling out the model. It delineates a series of critical paths and milestones, including: a description of the environment that is required to affect meaningful change, such as governance arrangements strategies for successfully applying and obtaining acceptance of change management activities. The roadmap also provides a timeline for succinct projects or actions, including activities such as: how to collect, analyse and use meaningful data developing a workforce plan developing a communications strategy. Each of these activities will have their own implementation plans associated with their completion and integration into the ACT palliative care landscape. Implementing the model's recommendations in a timely manner a nd in accordance with the roadmap will allow palliative care to become a leader in the redesign of the ACT health care system. The processes undertaken and the lessons learnt throughout the redesign experience will also stand as a best practice model for further reviews of other areas of health care under the Territorywide Clinical Services Plan . ACT Chronic Conditions Strategy 2013-2018 The ACT Chronic Conditions Strategy 2013-2018 continued to: provide overarching direction for chronic condition care and support in the ACT outline the requirement for a coordinated approach across the government and nongovernment sector.

Strategic Objective 10: Lo wer Prevalence of Diabetes than the National Average Strategic Indicator 10: The Proportion of the ACT Population Diagnosed with Some Form of Diabetes This indicator provides a marker of the success of prevention and early intervention initiatives. The self reported prevalence of diabetes in Australia has more than doubled over the past 25 years. A number of factors may have contributed to this, such as: changed criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes increased public awareness an increase in the prevalence of risk factors such as obesity and sedentary behaviour. Prevalence rates may also increase in the shortterm as a result of early intervention and detection campaigns. This would be a positive result as undiagnosed diabetes can have significant impacts on long term health. As shown in Table 8, the proportion of the ACT population with some form of diabetes is 4.3 per cent, which is consistent with the national proportion of 5.1 per cent.

Strategic Objective 11: Addressing Gaps in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Immunisation Status Strategic Indicator 11: Immunisation Rates - ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population The immunisation rate provides an indication of the level of investment in public health services to minimise the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases. The ACT's Indigenous population has a much lower rate of immunisation than the general population. The ACT aims to minimise disparities between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians through a targeted immunisation strategy. There has been improvement in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander immunisation coverage rates in the past year. The coverage rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 24-27 months, 60- 63 months and for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children has increased by three, two and one per cent respectively since 2015-16. ACT Health strives to increase the immunisation coverage rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children through a suite of activities. Postcards are sent to the parents of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to remind them when vaccinations are due and promotional materials to r aise the awareness of immunisation have been produced. The ACT aims to increase immunisation coverage rates for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children through a targeted immunisation strategy. 81 It should be noted that due to the very low numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the ACT, significant rate fluctuations can occur between reporting periods. Table 9 shows immunisation rates for 2016-17, by age and the total. TABLE 9: IMMUNISATION RATES FOR VACCINES IN THE NATIONAL SCHEDULE FOR THE ACT INDIGENOUS POPULATION1 2016 17 target 2016 17 result 12 to 15 months 90% 94% 24 to 27 months2 90% 90% 93% All 91% Notes: 1. The coverage rates above are annualised rates calculated from quarterly reports on childhood immunisation coverage for the, September 2016, December 2016, March 2017 quarters and June 2017. Data is from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR). The data show the proportion of children fully immunised at age 12-15 months, 24-27 months and 60-63 months according to the National Immunisation Program Schedule. 2. From December 2014, meningococcal C (given at 12 months) and dose 2 measles, mumps, rubella and dose 1 varicella (given as MMRV at 18 months) were included in the definition of fully immunised for the 24-27 month cohort. The more vaccines included in the assessment, the higher likelihood of reduced coverag e rates. Reduced immunisation coverage rates have been experienced in all Australian jurisdictions and for all children as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Coverage rates in this cohort are expected to increase over time as the changes become more routine. Contact details: For more information, contact phd@act.gov.au. Strategic Objective 12: Higher Participation Rate in the Cervical Screening Program than the National Average Strategic Indicator 12: Two Year Participation Rate in the Cervical Screening Program The two year participation rate provides an indication of the effectiveness of early intervention health messages. The ACT aims to exceed the national average for this indicator. As shown in Table 10, the ACT's two year participation rate for the target population is on par with the national average of 57.8 per cent.

The ACT aims to increase immunisation coverage rates for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children through a targeted immunisation strategy. 81 It should be noted that due to the very low numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the ACT, significant rate fluctuations can occur between reporting periods. Table 9 shows immunisation rates for 2016-17, by age and the total. TABLE 9: IMMUNISATION RATES FOR VACCINES IN THE NATIONAL SCHEDULE FOR THE ACT INDIGENOUS POPULATION1 2016 17 target 2016 17 result 12 to 15 months 90% 94% 24 to 27 months2 90% 90% 93% All 91% Notes: 1. The coverage rates above are annualised rates calculated from quarterly reports on childhood immunisation coverage for the, September 2016, December 2016, March 2017 quarters and June 2017. Data is from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR). The data show the proportion of children fully immunised at age 12-15 months, 24-27 months and 60-63 months according to the National Immunisation Program Schedule. 2. From December 2014, meningococcal C (given at 12 months) and dose 2 measles, mumps, rubella and dose 1 varicella (given as MMRV at 18 months) were included in the definition of fully immunised for the 24-27 month cohort. The more vaccines included in the assessment, the higher likelihood of reduced coverage rates. Reduced immunisation coverage rates have been experienced in all Australian jurisdictions and for all children as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Coverage rates in this cohort are expected to increase over time as the changes become more routine. Contact details: For more information, contact phd@act.gov.au. Strategic Objective 12: Higher Participation Rate in the Cervical Screening Program than the National Average Strategic Indicator 12: Two Year Participation Rate in the Cervical Screening Program The two year participation rate provides an indication of the effectiveness of early intervention health messages. The ACT aims to exceed the national average for t his indicator. As shown in Table 10, the ACT's two year participation rate for the target population is on par with the national average of 57.8 per cent.

The position has line management responsibility for the Patient Flow Unit and Territory Wide Surgical Services. The Chief of Clinical Operations is also the executive lead for planning for the Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre. Performance against accountability indicators Emergency Department A $23 million expansion of the Emergency Department, which commenced in 2015, has now been completed, resulting in: an extra 1,000 square metres of floor space 21 additional treatment spaces three more ambulance bays. This refurbishment is part of a response to the ever i ncreasing demand for Emergency Department services. There has been an average of 10 per cent growth in emergency presentations year on year since the expansion commenced. Added to this is $29 million in additional funding to provide 54 new Emergency Department staff over the four years to financial year 2019-20, to support access to timely emergency healthcare as demand continues to grow. The new Emergency Department also includes a Fast Track area, which has: ten bed spaces three procedure rooms a dedicated waiting area. It is designed to treat patients with less acute conditions. The expanded 12bed Emergency Medicine Unit (EMU) continued to provide care to patients who required less than 24 hours of care. In addition, three new beds provided greater flexibility to those patients who required an inpatient ward bed for less than 12 hours. These initiatives are instrumental in continuing to improve the timeliness of care in the Emergency Department. In addition to expanding the physical facility, process and practice reform has resulted in the implementation of an Emergency Department Navigator role and Teambased Care. These initiatives have been designed to enhance patient flow within the Emergency Department and improve timeliness to treatment. THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT NOW HAS AN ADDITIONAL 21 TREATMENT SPACES AND THREE MORE AMBULANCE BAYS. 95 The improved facility and reforms have assisted greatly in achieving improvements in the number of patients with a stay in Emergency Department of less than four hours and a reduction in the number of people who choose to leave the Emergency Department before they are treated. Elective and emergency surgery During 2016-17, ACT Health significantly reduced the number of people waiting longer than the recommended timeframes for surgery. Canberra Hospital is the major tertiary and trauma referral centre for the ACT and surrounding NSW and is equipped and able to manage trauma and emergency cases that cannot be provided by neighbouring facilities and regions. The increasing demand for elective and emergency surgery has continued into the 2016-17 financial year. ACT Health continues to review where and how surgery is delivered in the ACT, to ensure that patients are receiving their surgery in the right facility at the right time. Surgical resources are now managed through the Territory Wide Surgical Management Committee (TWSMC), which has representatives from Calvary and Canberra Hospitals. The committee monitors Elective Surgery Wait List performance across the Territory and has the capacity to allocate extra resources where needed. The TWSMC has adopted strategies to continue to manage timeliness of surgical a ccess into the future. ACT public hospitals have made significant improvements in how quickly patients access their elective surgery within clinically recommended timeframes. These improvements have continued into the 2016-17 financial year. In partnership with the private hospital sector, the Elective Joint Replacement Program provided 458 patients with joint replacements in the 2016-17 financial year. The Elective Joint Replacement Program is achieving a dramatic decrease in the orthopaedic joint waitlist, with very few patients waiting longer than the clinically recommended time. This program will continue through 2017-19, with the aim of further reducing waiting time for joint replacements. Dental health care The National Child Oral Health Study 2012-14 was released in February 2017. It provides a detailed snapshot of child oral health in Australia, including: oral health status use of dental services behaviours and trends in child oral health. This study is considered one of the largest and most comprehensive surveys of child oral health in the world. The report found that the prevalence of dental decay in children in the ACT was lower than the national average. The Division of Surgery and Oral Health through the ACT Dental Health Program continued working to further reduce the prevalence of childhood dental decay b y implementing preventative education and screening programs across a number of ACT primary schools that have a low socioeconomic scale. Prevent Alcohol and Risk Related Trauma in Youth In Australia, adolescents and young people aged 16-24 years have the highest rates of injury of all age groups. These findings are consistent with global population health data.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-1796 96 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 young people account for 52 per cent of all alcoholrelated serious injuries and 32 per cent of all alcohol attributable hospital admissions for injuries caused by violence. Of the young people significantly injured in the ACT and its surrounding region: 25 per cent will die as the result of their injures 40 to 45 per cent will require an Intensive Care Unit admission 10 per cent will need formal rehabilitation due to disability. The burden of injury in those that survive is significant. These patients are known to have prolonged functional deficits at five years following injury, which is associated with: longterm loss of productivity and capacity to return to work a high incidence of psychological injury. As such, injury can have a devastating impact not only on the individual and their family, but also on the community. Recognising the significance of these statistics, in 2015 the nursing team within the ACT Trauma Service championed for the development and introduction of the Prevent Alcohol and Risk Related Trauma in Youth (PARTY) Program. The program involves a full day inhospital excursion aimed at senior students aged 15-18 years and is offered to the school at no cost. Various members of the multidisciplinary team: provide education and insight into the effect of major injury on them clinically and personally encourage active participation in discussions about potentially dangerous situations and behaviours offer advice on how to develop strategies to minimise harm. Students are also provided with face toface personal experiences from current and previous patients and the opportunity to discuss the impact that injury has not only on themselves, but on their family and friends. This personal testimony is ranked one of the highest impact sessions of the day. One student has said: \"The experience with the P.A.R.T.Y program was a sobering, and brilliant experience for all involved, making us think about our actions, what we want to do with our lives, as well as how much could change in an instant' (Year 10 PARTY Program Participant). \" The program has been developed to be adaptable to suit contextual community trends and flexible enough to respond to cultural changes in society. Although the program currently focuses on alcohol and road trauma, other areas of risk taking behaviour can be addressed if demand requires it, for example drug use, mental health and suicide prevention. Due to the in sight and initiative of nurses, this program has become a vital component of the growing community effort to reduce death and injury in alcohol and riskrelated crashes and other incidents. It does so by: empowering youth facilitating parental discussions surrounding life choices and risk THE PARTY PROGRAM CONTINUES TO INFORM AND EDUCATE 15-18 YEAR OLD STUDENTS ABOUT THE REALLIFE AND LONGTERM IMPACTS OF MAJOR INJURY ON INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS, AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS.

Pathology In March 2017, ACT Pathology was reaccredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities and Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. The accreditation applies to all areas involved in preanalytics and laboratory analytics for Canberra Hospital and Calvary Hospital laboratories. Other achievements included: implementing new blood culture instrumentation in Microbiology, which increased capacity and provided earlier detection of positive cultures, thereby enhancing patient care implementing a specimen identification and tracking system in Anatomical Pathology, which will enhance patient safety by providing traceability of all specimens received into the laboratory implementing new blood transfusion analysers in Haematology, which will make transfusion results retrievable by the Calvary and Canberra Hospital laboratories, thereby enhancing patient safety if they are transferred between hospitals acquiring new equipment in Molecular Pathology to increase capacity and dramatically reduce turnaround times for viral infection diagnoses during flu season installing a robotic unloading system and implementing other improvements in Canberra Hospital to significantly reduce the time it takes for specimens to reach Pathology and reduce the occupational risk to staff, many of whom o pen over 50 canisters per day implementing the Positive Patient Identification (PPID) and pathology eOrdering system in Ward 11B and the Coronary Care Unit, which reduced blood collection errors by 33 per cent in the two pilot wards three months after the system was introduced. Medical Imaging ACT Health achieved significant improvements in access and services for patients to Medical Imaging services, including: reducing the outpatient waiting lists for: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Computerised Tomography (CT) Ultrasound (US) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Nuclear Medicine studies introducing a Cardiac CT service extending outpatient service hours. This means that all outpatients requiring urgent diagnostic imaging can be accommodated within two to five days, depending on the study required. Some patients now have 24 hour access, while patients requiring nonurgent CT studies can have an appointment within 24 to 48 hours. As a result of reforms and strategies implemented to support efficient patient flow and Emergency Department treatment times, significant reductions were achieved in: Emergency Department CT, US and Xray response AT 30 JUNE 2017, THERE WAS NO WAITING LIST FOR OUTPATIENT CT SCANS. 97 96 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 young people account for 52 per cent of all alcoholrelated serious injuries and 32 per cent of all alcohol attributable hospital admissions for injuries caused by violence.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-1798 98 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 waiting times for inpatients needing diagnostic CT, US, MRI and xray. In some patient groups, such as neurology, this contributed to a reduced length of stay of up to three days. These response time reductions for CHHS Medical Imaging were achieved while activity continued to increase: MRI inpatient studies increased by 11.9 per cent CT inpatient visits increased by 13.5 per cent PET inpatient visits increased by 28.1 per cent MRI outpatient studies increased by 30.7 per cent CT outpatient visits increased by 4 per cent. Division of Medicine On 6 February 2017, the Medical Assessment and Planning Unit (MAPU) and General Medical Unit (GMU) consolidated into a single Model of Care (MoC) called General Medicine, located in Ward 7B. In line with this MoC change: the criteria for admissions to some subspecialty wards was reviewed General Medicine expanded its consult service to other units for patients with multiple active medical issues, who would benefit from the input of a General Practitioner (GP). The aim of this MoC is to optimise the patient experience for patients with complex needs by: securing optimal clinical outcomes reducing avoidable delays improving care coordination. Gastroenterology and Hepatology Unit Extensive work has been undertaken to i mprove access to and management of endoscopy services provided by the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Unit (GEHU) at Canberra Hospital, as demand for these services continues to increase year on year. This work included: increasing utilisation of available endoscopy sessions increasing the number of locum lists providing weekend endoscopy lists throughout 2016 providing some procedures to suitable patients at Queanbeyan Hospital. Cardiac imaging medicine Cardiology has established a specific Coronary Angiography Computed Tomography Service to improve care for patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome. This service builds on existing cardiology services, such as the Chest Pain Evaluation Unit and contributes to identifying a patient's underlying cardiac conditions. Privately Practising Eligible Midwives at the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children During 2016-17, two Privately Practising Eligible Midwives signed collaborative agreements with ACT Health to provide private midwifery services to their private patients at the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children. An eligible midwife is a midwife who is: noted on the National Midwifery Board of Australia 99 endorsed to prescribe specified medicines endorsed to provide associated services for midwifery practice. The National Maternity Services review of 2009 highlighted the need for Endorsed Privately Practising Midwives to access clinical privileges in public maternity services. This allows women to receive continuity of care by their known midwife in a hospital setting. The progress in developing this MoC reflects the importance that ACT Health places on the concepts of choice and continuity of care when providing maternity services to women. Publicly funded homebirth service A trial of a publicly funded homebirth program commenced in early 2017 for women at low risk of obstetric complications. The threeyear trial is being delivered through the Canberra Midwifery Program (CMP) and is available to eligible women who reside within a 30 minute round trip to the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, as defined by the ACT Ambulance Service. Eligibility criteria for the trial are based on general and clinical guidelines with continuous risk assessment conducted throughout pregnancy and labour. The trial will provide one or two homebirths per month over the threeyear period, up to 24 births per year. Dental healthThe Dental Health Program has continued to achieve the mean waiting time target of s ix months for adults on the routine dental services waiting list. There is no waiting time for children. The Mobile Dental Clinic was operational again this year, visiting Canberrans residing in aged care facilities, who might otherwise not be able to access a dentist. Feedback from clients and their families indicates that this is a valued service, which can significantly improve a client's outlook after a client is provided with new dentures or after a routine check up. The team members who operate this van have been trained to care for patients suffering dementia and Alzheimer's, which further ensures appropriate care to these clients. Improving access to Outpatient and Ambulatory Services Ambulatory Care Support Services has been working with the Division of Medicine and the Division of Surgery and Oral Health to improve inpatient wait times for outpatient services. Multiple strategies are required to address both demand and capacity to achieve a reduction in wait times. Achievements in 2016-17 include: implementing a standardised wait list that provides a consistent data reporting approach introducing a procedure for booking patients within their triage category, in the order in which their referrals are received introducing additional clinics in Urology, Ear Nose and Throat, General Surgery, and Orthopaedics, which have stabilised the i ncrease in, and in some cases reduced, the number of patients waiting outside recommended timeframes forming a single intake team by merging several previously discrete teams, which has created efficiencies and improved coordination of the intake process introducing a Registered Nurse to review medical outpatient referrals for suitability, urgency and other factors, which has assisted in reducing inappropriate, incomplete and duplicate referrals introducing an Advanced Practice Nurse to the Urology Outpatients Department, which has significantly improved patient throughput due to improved triaging, timely followup and patient flow. 99 98 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 waiting times for inpatients needing diagnostic CT, US, MRI and xray. In some patient groups, such as neurology, this contributed to a reduced length of stay of up to three days. These response time reductions for CHHS Medical Imaging were achieved while activity continued to increase: MRI inpatient studies increased by 11.9 per cent CT inpatient visits increased by 13.5 per cent PET inpatient visits increased by 28.1 per cent MRI outpatient studies increased by 30.7 per cent CT outpatient visits increased by 4 per cent. Division of Medicine On 6 February 2017, the Medical Assessment and Planning Unit (MAPU) and General Medical Unit (GMU) consolidated into a single Model of Care (MoC) called General Medicine, located in Ward 7B. In line with this MoC change: the criteria for admissions to some subspecialty wards was reviewed General Medicine expanded its consult service to other units for patients with multiple active medical issues, who would benefit from the input of a General Practitioner (GP). The aim of this MoC is to optimise the patient experience for patients with complex needs by: securing optimal clinical outcomes reducing avoidable delays improving care coordination. Gastroente rology and Hepatology Unit Extensive work has been undertaken to improve access to and management of endoscopy services provided by the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Unit (GEHU) at Canberra Hospital, as demand for these services continues to increase year on year. This work included: increasing utilisation of available endoscopy sessions increasing the number of locum lists providing weekend endoscopy lists throughout 2016 providing some procedures to suitable patients at Queanbeyan Hospital. Cardiac imaging medicine Cardiology has established a specific Coronary Angiography Computed Tomography Service to improve care for patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome. This service builds on existing cardiology services, such as the Chest Pain Evaluation Unit and contributes to identifying a patient's underlying cardiac conditions. Privately Practising Eligible Midwives at the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children During 2016-17, two Privately Practising Eligible Midwives signed collaborative agreements with ACT Health to provide private midwifery services to their private patients at the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children. An eligible midwife is a midwife who is: noted on the National Midwifery Board of Australia 99 endorsed to prescribe specified medicines endorsed to provide associated services for midwifery practice. The National Maternity Services review of 2009 highlighted the need for Endorsed Privately Practising Midwives to access clinical privileges in public maternity services. This allows women to receive continuity of care by their known midwife in a hospital setting. The progress in developing this MoC reflects the importance that ACT Health places on the concepts of choice and continuity of care when providing maternity services to women. Publicly funded homebirth service A trial of a publicly funded homebirth program commenced in early 2017 for women at low risk of obstetric complications. The threeyear trial is being delivered through the Canberra Midwifery Program (CMP) and is available to eligible women who reside within a 30 minute round trip to the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, as defined by the ACT Ambulance Service. Eligibility criteria for the trial are based on general and clinical guidelines with continuous risk assessment conducted throughout pregnancy and labour. The trial will provide one or two homebirths per month over the threeyear period, up to 24 births per year. Dental healthThe Dental Health Program has continued to achieve the mean waiting time target of six mo nths for adults on the routine dental services waiting list. There is no waiting time for children. The Mobile Dental Clinic was operational again this year, visiting Canberrans residing in aged care facilities, who might otherwise not be able to access a dentist. Feedback from clients and their families indicates that this is a valued service, which can significantly improve a client's outlook after a client is provided with new dentures or after a routine check up. The team members who operate this van have been trained to care for patients suffering dementia and Alzheimer's, which further ensures appropriate care to these clients. Improving access to Outpatient and Ambulatory Services Ambulatory Care Support Services has been working with the Division of Medicine and the Division of Surgery and Oral Health to improve inpatient wait times for outpatient services. Multiple strategies are required to address both demand and capacity to achieve a reduction in wait times. Achievements in 2016-17 include: implementing a standardised wait list that provides a consistent data reporting approach introducing a procedure for booking patients within their triage category, in the order in which their referrals are received introducing additional clinics in Urology, Ear Nose and Throat, General Surgery, and Orthopaedics, which have stabilised the i ncrease in, and in some cases reduced, the number of patients waiting outside recommended timeframes forming a single intake team by merging several previously discrete teams, which has created efficiencies and improved coordination of the intake process introducing a Registered Nurse to review medical outpatient referrals for suitability, urgency and other factors, which has assisted in reducing inappropriate, incomplete and duplicate referrals introducing an Advanced Practice Nurse to the Urology Outpatients Department, which has significantly improved patient throughput due to improved triaging, timely followup and patient flow. ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17100 100 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Awards and nominations Several staff and teams in the acute divisions were recognised at the ACT Excellence Awards for Nurses and Midwives 2017, including: Therese Knight, Intensive Care, Excellence in Clinical Practice the Coronary Care Unit Nursing Team, Excellence in Quality Improvement or Research Carolyn Thomas, Child and Youth Services Central Regional Team, Excellence in Management Practice. Several staff and teams were also winners at the Quality in Healthcare ACT Awards 2017, including: Overall winner: the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Safety award winner: 'Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI) in NICU Following Introduction of a Central Line Bundle' . Clinical lead, Dr Tejasvi Chaudhari Innovative Models of Care award winner: the Maternity Unit, Centenary Hospital for Women and Children Access and Efficiency award finalist: Louise Hawkins. Other recognition of the acute divisions included: The Child At Risk Health Unit (CARHU) therapy team received the Certificate of Appreciation for Collaboration at the Community Safety Directorate DirectorGeneral Excellence Awards. CARHU brings together the Child and Youth Protection worker, parents, school executives and family support workers to form a cohesive team around children who have experienced child abuse and those who show challenging behaviours. Professor Stephen Robson was elected P resident of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) and commenced his office in November 2016. In 2017, he also took up office as President of the ACT branch of the Australian Medical Association. Future directions Emergency Department performance The Division of Critical Care will continue to work towards improving access and timeliness within the Emergency Department, while maintaining quality care and striving to meet the increasing demand on services. The key target area for improvement is reducing the time to be seen for emergency triage categories two to four. Dental health The ACT Government has provided additional funding commencing in 2017-18 to expand access to dental services for the most vulnerable Canberrans, by providing more Mobile Dental Clinics (MDCs). Stakeholder consultation is underway to identify which populations may benefit the most from an expansion to this model and how that expansion will be rolled out to the community. The new vans are expected to be operational by December 2018. Surgery and Oral Health In 2017-18, the Division of Surgery and Oral Health will be working closely with the Obesity Management Service (OMS) to provide bariatric surgery to public patients who meet the eligibility criteria. This service has been a long awaited development for t he ACT community and will provide a clinical pathway for patients waiting to access a potentially lifechanging procedure. Longterm studies have shown that weight 101 reduction surgery can have an impact not only on a person's weight but also on other significant co morbidities, such as: diabetes obstructive sleep apnoea cardiovascular disease. The Division of Surgery and Oral Health procured the necessary equipment and resources in order to commence the first procedures in early 2017. The aim is to expand access to this procedure following review of the initial cases. General Surgeons will be working with the multidisciplinary OMS team to ensure that clients are supported and guided through the care pathway for bariatric surgery. The OMS provides people with: support from a dietician and a psychologist as part of the multidisciplinary team ongoing care coordination, which can involve a GP. This approach maximises the benefits and health outcomes for the person by: providing ongoing monitoring of nutritional status preventing nutritional deficiencies maximising longterm weight loss. Chief of Clinical Operations The Chief of Clinical Operations will continue to develop processes to improve patient flow across CHHS. Patient flow includes: reducing wait times for inpatient admission through emergency departments achieving timely and efficient transfer of patients from the Intensive Care Unit and the post anaesthesia care unit to the medical and surgical units improving flow from the inpatient setting to longterm care facilities. Patient flow will be improved by: monitoring discharge planning across CHHS focusing on predictive and proactive planning for capacity management and patient flow requirements monitoring the number of long stay patients across CHHS ongoing work to improve the number of weekend discharges. Increasing access to elective surgery A Wholeof Territory elective surgery plan is being developed to manage demand into the future. The plan is being developed by the TWSMC and includes a subcommittee which meets fortnightly to make recommendations for operational change. The TWSMC has developed: a standardised reporting tool to highlight failures to meet time frames and to identify appropriate corrective actions a mathematical model to predict and plan the work effort required across the Territory to meet timeliness targets, which can be used to inform budget bids and allocate work across public and private facilities. 101 100 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Awards and nominations Several staff and teams in the acute divisions were recognised at the ACT Excellence Awards for Nurses and Midwives 2017, including: Therese Knight, Intensive Care, Excellence in Clinical Practice the Coronary Care Unit Nursing Team, Excellence in Quality Improvement or Research Carolyn Thomas, Child and Youth Services Central Regional Team, Excellence in Management Practice.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17102 102 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Hip Fracture Clinical Pathway In 2016-17, an ACT Health working group developed a Hip Fracture Clinical Pathway, which was introduced in July 2017. This pathway aims to improve the patient journey for patients with hip fracture, by recognising the importance of a collaborative multidisciplinary healthcare team. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the current Patient Care and Assessment Plan, forming part of the clinical record. The pathway is intended to produce optimal results for patients in terms of pain management, early intervention and better rehabilitation outcomes. The pathway begins in the Emergency Department, progresses to the inpatient clinical area where the patient is admitted and continues through to discharge. The pathway has been developed using best practice evidence and adheres to standards of care documents for the hip fracture patient. However, it is unique in recognising the roles of all members of the healthcare team involved in caring for patients with a hip fracture. The pathway includes various enhancements to patient care, such as the enhanced Ortho Geriatric MoC, which provides an increased level of physiotherapy support to this cohort of patients. Assessment of innovation programs Several current key areas of focus which are intended to improve patient access and support consumer choice will be monitored closely to ensure th ey meet expected outcomes, including: the publicly funded home birth program Emergency Department performance endoscopy waiting times. In addition, a redesign of Central Outpatient Services is expected to deliver further improved access in the ambulatory care setting. Initiatives, such as rapid access clinics, are being considered as possibilities for enhancing the delivery of outpatient services. The benefits of introducing an Advanced Practice Nurse will be explored for the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Service. As discussed previously, this model has significantly improved patient throughput in the Urology Outpatients Department.

This is predominantly attributable to an incorrect calculation of the 2016-17 targets. The 2016-17 targets were not correctly calculated because they did not include the occasions of service for the Crisis Assessment and Treatment Team (CATT) and Mobile Intensive Treatment Team (MITT), which were moved into the Adult Community Mental Health Services. The 2017-18 targets have been recalculated to reflect the correct services in Adult Community Mental Health Services. Achieved 100 per cent of all detainees admitted to the Alexander Maconochie Centre (AMC) having a completed health assessment within 24 hours of detention. 105 Exceeded the target of 155,000 occasions of service within Justice Health Services Program by 2 per cent. This achievement can be attributed to the increased number of detainees at the AMC. There were some challenges for the Division this year and work continues to improve performance for these programs: Unexpected staff vacancies and difficulties with the recruitment program were the major factor in a lower than expected result of 12 per cent below the target of 70,000 occasions of service in Alcohol and Drug Services. Two detainees admitted to Bimberi did not have their health assessments completed within 24 hours of detention. However, these two detainees' health assessments were completed within 48 hours. The health assessment includes the primary health assessment and the mental health check. Both were completed at the same time, within 48 hours. A higher than expected result for episodes of seclusion in 2016-17, of four per cent compared to the target of three per cent, occurred due to the opening of the Dhulwa Mental Health Unit (Dhulwa) this year, which resulted in a new cohort of patients not previously captured in ACT Health seclusion data. This is a small cohort of patients, so a small increase in t he raw number causes a significant increase in percentage. The targets for occasions of service in the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) and Rehabilitation and Speciality Mental Health Services programs were not achieved. CAMHS under achieved by 12 per cent against the target of 75,000 partially due to an incorrect calculation in the target due to incorrect clinical mapping. The 2016-17 target should have been increased by 10 per cent not 10,000. If correctly calculated, the variance would have been an underachievement of eight per cent, which is primarily attributable to staff vacancies. Rehabilitation and Speciality Mental Health Services under achieved against its target of 80,000 by 64 per cent, which was primarily attributable to incorrect calculation of the 2016-17 target due to incorrect clinical mapping. If correctly calculated the target should have actually been set at 26,250 which would have resulted in an over achievement of nine per cent. This would be attributable to the new Intensive Treatment Services in the older person's mental health and the increase of 3.0 FTE staff during the reporting period. Emergency mental health care The Mental Health Short Stay Unit is a sixbed standalone unit adjacent to Canberra Hospital Emergency Department, staffed with experie nced mental health medical and nursing staff. The unit is operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It provides people presenting to the Emergency Department with mental health issues with the opportunity for: extended clinical observation crisis stabilisation comprehensive mental health assessment and intervention. These services are available for up to 48 hours. In 2016-17, 859 people were treated through this service. On 1 September 2016, the Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU) increased the number of commissioned mental health inpatient beds from 35 to 37 beds. The additional beds have been accommodated within the existing AMHU Model of Care (MoC) framework and improve: access to acute mental health services patient flow through Canberra Hospital Emergency Department. 105 104 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Rehabilitation and Specialty Mental Health Services Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Mental Health Services Adult Mental Health Day Service Brian Hennessy Rehabilitation Centre Mental Health Comorbidity Clinician Mental Health Service for People with Intellectual Disabilities Neuropsychology Older Persons Mental Health Team Justice Health Services Dhulwa Mental Health Unit Primary Health Services Forensic Mental Health Services Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) CAMHS North Community Team CAMHS South Community Team Childhood Early Intervention Program Specialist Youth Mental Health Outreach Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) Program Perinatal Mental Health Consultation Service Eating Disorders Program The Cottage Alcohol and Drug Programs Consultation and Liaison Service Counselling and Treatment Services Police and Court Drug Diversion Services Opioid Treatment Service Withdrawal Services Performance against accountability indicators In 2016-17, MHJHADS: Exceeded the target of 155,000 occasions of service by 25 per cent within the Adult Community Mental Health Services Program.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17106 106 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Mental health services A major achievement this year was the delivery of Dhulwa. Dhulwa provides mental health care in the most secure facility in the ACT. The first ten beds became available in November 2016, although it has a longer term capacity of 25 beds. Dhulwa has a strong rehabilitation and recovery ethos and focuses on helping the whole person and not simply treating a mental illness. The Mental Health Consultation and Liaison service continues to expand, to provide after hours support seven days a week, 365 days a year. The service assists people who have mental healthrelated issues when they are admitted to the general wards of Canberra Hospital. The CAMHS Specialist Youth Mental Health Outreach Team was initiated in October 2016. It provides assertive outreach and intensive mental health treatment and care for young people aged 14-25 years in the ACT who are at high risk of developing, or are currently experiencing, early onset psychosis. This service also provides outreach care to highly vulnerable young people aged 14-18 years who experience severe anxiety and/or depression and have difficulties accessing clinicbased treatment. The Older Person's Community Mental Health Team also continues to expand, to provide intensive support for people with p sychogeriatric conditions with an acute episode of mental illness who are: living in the community with deteriorating mental state transitioning from an acute inpatient unit to the community. This Intensive Treatment Service (ITS) provides assistance and care to older people with moderate to severe mental illness to prevent admission to hospital and to enable safe early discharge from hospital. Alcohol and Drug Services Specialist medical, counselling and case management drug treatment services at Tuggeranong and Belconnen Community Health Centres have continued to operate, complementing existing services provided at Canberra Hospital. These outreach services have improved access for people with substance use disorders. The Youth Drug and Alcohol Program continues to provide services to engage young people with substance use issues. This includes building partnerships with ACT Colleges, Headspace and the Youth Junction to improve access. In December 2016, a Nurse Practitioner was employed to support the Alcohol and Drug Service Consultation and Liaison services at Canberra Hospital. This position has resulted in more timely access to assessments, information and referrals for people admitted to Canberra Hospital with substance use disorders, particularly those accessing mental health services. Justice Health Services Justice Health Services, includes the following teams: Dhulwa Mental Health Unit Primary Health Services provided at both AMC and Bimberi Forensic Mental Health Services provided at AMC, Bimberi and in the community Throughout 2016-17, Justice Health Services continued to provide health care to: people in adult correctional centres DHULWA, THE SECURE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT, OPENED IN NOVEMBER 2016. 107 young people in the Bimberi Youth Justice Centre people in the court cells people with highrisk mental health needs in the community. Primary Health Services provided community equivalent primary health services to adults and young people in: the AMC Bimberi Youth Justice Centre the ACT court cells Dhulwa. Forensic Mental Health Services (FMHS) continued to provide its services to: people in the AMC people in the Bimberi Youth Justice Centre people in the courts and court cells the community. In 2016-17, FMHS also began supporting the mental health clinicians in the Australian Federal Police Fixated Threat Assessment team. Engaging and liaising with other support and shared care organisations MHJHADS continues to experience challenges in the timely discharge of some patients. This continues to primarily be related to accessing appropriate housing options. Work continues to improve interagency relationships, particularly with ACT Housing and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) to: ensure the needs of these people are appropriately met in the community reduce the impact on acute and rehabilitation mental health inpatient beds. Aggression and Violence Divisional Framework ACT Health is a national leader in reducing the use of seclusion and restraint in mental health inpatient settings and this remains a high priority for staff. Seclusion r eview meetings continue to monitor seclusion episodes and implement ongoing strategies to minimise the use of seclusion and restraint. The Early Support Intervention Team continues to support patients and staff to identify escalating behaviours that, if not addressed, may lead to the need to use seclusion or restraint by: enabling distress in mental health ward patients to be identified early providing a supportive response to minimise the impacts of distress. As an additional support, the Aggression and Violence Divisional Framework has been adopted and is supported by clinical guidelines, which continue to be implemented throughout the adult inpatient mental health units. These guiding documents: provide further clinical guidance and support to staff in the early identification and management of aggression and violence contribute to the ongoing strategy to reduce seclusion and restraint episodes. WorkforceThe MHJHADS workforce continues to be challenged by staff shortages while also experiencing increased service growth. The last year has seen a net loss of senior medical staff in the Mental Health stream of the 107 106 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Mental health services A major achievement this year was the delivery of Dhulwa. Dhulwa provides mental health care in the most secure facility in the ACT. The first ten beds became available in November 2016, although it has a longer term capacity of 25 beds. Dhulwa has a strong rehabilitation and recovery ethos and focuses on helping the whole person and not simply treating a mental illness. The Mental Health Consultation and Liaison service continues to expand, to provide after hours support seven days a week, 365 days a year. The service assists people who have mental healthrelated issues when they are admitted to the general wards of Canberra Hospital. The CAMHS Specialist Youth Mental Health Outreach Team was initiated in October 2016. It provides assertive outreach and intensive mental health treatment and care for young people aged 14-25 years in the ACT who are at high risk of developing, or are currently experiencing, early onset psychosis. This service also provides outreach care to highly vulnerable young people aged 14-18 years who experience severe anxiety and/or depression and have difficulties accessing clinicbased treatment. The Older Person's Community Mental Health Team also continues to expand, to p rovide intensive support for people with psychogeriatric conditions with an acute episode of mental illness who are: living in the community with deteriorating mental state transitioning from an acute inpatient unit to the community. This Intensive Treatment Service (ITS) provides assistance and care to older people with moderate to severe mental illness to prevent admission to hospital and to enable safe early discharge from hospital. Alcohol and Drug Services Specialist medical, counselling and case management drug treatment services at Tuggeranong and Belconnen Community Health Centres have continued to operate, complementing existing services provided at Canberra Hospital. These outreach services have improved access for people with substance use disorders. The Youth Drug and Alcohol Program continues to provide services to engage young people with substance use issues. This includes building partnerships with ACT Colleges, Headspace and the Youth Junction to improve access. In December 2016, a Nurse Practitioner was employed to support the Alcohol and Drug Service Consultation and Liaison services at Canberra Hospital. This position has resulted in more timely access to assessments, information and referrals for people admitted to Canberra Hospital with substance use disorders, particularly those accessing mental health services. Justice Health Services Justice Health Services, includes the following teams: Dhulwa Mental Health U nit Primary Health Services provided at both AMC and Bimberi Forensic Mental Health Services provided at AMC, Bimberi and in the community Throughout 2016-17, Justice Health Services continued to provide health care to: people in adult correctional centres DHULWA, THE SECURE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT, OPENED IN NOVEMBER 2016. 107 young people in the Bimberi Youth Justice Centre people in the court cells people with highrisk mental health needs in the community. Primary Health Services provided community equivalent primary health services to adults and young people in: the AMC Bimberi Youth Justice Centre the ACT court cells Dhulwa. Forensic Mental Health Services (FMHS) continued to provide its services to: people in the AMC people in the Bimberi Youth Justice Centre people in the courts and court cells the community. In 2016-17, FMHS also began supporting the mental health clinicians in the Australian Federal Police Fixated Threat Assessment team. Engaging and liaising with other support and shared care organisations MHJHADS continues to experience challenges in the timely discharge of some patients. This continues to primarily be related to accessing appropriate housing options. Work continues to improve interagency relationships, particularly with ACT Housing and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) to: ensure the needs of these people are appropriately met in the community reduce the impact on acute and rehabilitation mental health inpatient beds. Aggression and Violence Divisional Framework ACT Health is a national leader in reducing the use of seclusion and restraint in mental health inpatient settings and this remains a high priority for staff.

The last year has seen a net loss of senior medical staff in the Mental Health stream of the ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17108 108 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Division and the retirement of the Chief Psychiatrist. Strenuous efforts have been and continue to be, undertaken to recruit to these positions. Two newly appointed Clinical Directors for the Community and CAMHS have commenced and the Clinical Director for the Forensic Mental Health will commence in October 2017. The junior medical workforce has been stable and the trainees in psychiatry continue to achieve exceptional results in their assessments towards gaining Fellowship of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. During the year, the approach to Nursing Governance for MHJHADS changed with the formation of Nursing Council. The current model for Nursing Professional Supervision is being expanded to provide a broader range of options with the implementation of Communities of Practice model for nursing. To complement the career structure, Level 1 Registered Nurses have been introduced into the community mental health teams. Nurse Practitioner positions have been created in Alcohol and Drug Services and CAMHS. The opening of Dhulwa and the expansion of health services at the AMC required a significant recruitment effort, particularly for nursing staff. The Post Graduate Mental Health Nursing Program, delivered in partnership with the University of Canberra, continues to be highly sought after and demand for und ergraduate nursing clinical placements across MHJHADS has been high. MHJHADS is conducting a sixmonth pilot of a communitybased ehealth resource and group program, led by a peer support worker at the Adult Mental Health Day Service (AMHDS). This pilot commenced in March 2017 and is expected to improve consumer's quality of life and their recovery attitudes. The pilot will be evaluated in late 2017, with an expected gradual rollout of peer support workers across MHJHADS. Peer support workers in other Australian and international jurisdictions are increasingly being used to lead self education and selfhelp interventions for consumers. This is consistent with research that found outcomes from peer services are as good if not better than conventional mental health services (National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery, 2014) MHJHADS has developed a culturally responsive framework, to support the establishment of cultural safety for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people accessing the service. In support of this, the current Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Liaison Officers (ALOs) have been colocated in one team. The aim is to improve health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by: sharing cultural knowledge minimising isolation of ALOs providing access to a streamlined structure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people enabling better opportunities for preventative care and hospital diversion. Future directions Child and adolescent mental health services The 2017-18 ACT Budget provided funding to CAMHS to enhance the Childhood Early Intervention Team. The team will provide: additional screening and single intervention sessions to parents targeted group work to ACT primary schools. Funding was also received to expand the CAMHS hospital consultation liaison to cover the Emergency Department seven days a week, 365 days a year. This will provide patients with immediate assessments and linkages to appropriate services. 109 CAMHS is intending to provide all CAMHS staff with family therapy training. This will strengthen family and carer participation in psychoeducation and therapeutic treatment. The 2017-18 ACT Budget also provided funding for an inpatient unit for children and young people at the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children. Adult mental health services A further seven beds are expected to open at Dhulwa in 2017-18 for phase two of this project. The Auditor General Performance Report, Mental Health Services - Transition from Acute Care has made seven recommendations for ACT Health. The ACT Government response to the performance audit report is due to be tabled at the Legislative Assembly in October 2017. ACT Government funding for a new StepUpStepDown (SUSD) facility was approved as a new capital initiative in the 2016-17 ACT Budget. Planning for a Southside Community SUSD facility has begun. This includes developing a MoC and a Health Planning Unit brief, which will be used to inform the design of the facility. The SUSD facility will provide an option for people who are becoming unwell, or who are in the early stages of recovery from an acute mental illness, who need a short period of additional support to consolidate t heir community transition and treatment plans. The facility will be delivered in partnership with a community agency to provide 24hour clinical and psychosocial services. Unlike existing SUSD units in the ACT, this new facility will provide shorter term (approximately two weeks) intensive and structured recoveryoriented care. Support will focus on providing: clinical treatment and care rehabilitation community linkage information. The aim is to reduce inpatient admissions and provide the person with a clear transition pathway back into the community. Rehabilitation and Specialty Mental Health Services are actively involved with commissioning the Adult Mental Health Rehabilitation Unit (AMHRU) and the AMHDS at the University of Canberra Public Hospital (UCPH). The hospital is due to open mid2018. The primary function of the AMHDS will be to offer a multidisciplinary approach to the biopsychosocial assessment and treatment of people with moderate to severe mental illness, in a supportive and recovery oriented environment. The primary goal of the service will be to optimise symptom relief and support people living with a mental illness to build the skills and the capacity to cope more effectively and live well in the community. The AMHRU will provide coordinated intensive individual and group re habilitation services to help develop and maintain a person's ability to adapt and function in the community. This will minimise the effects of longterm care and assist with returning to community living. The unit will assist people to: identify and address social determinants of health access the information and support resources they need to become and stay healthy.

The Adult Community Mental Health MoC has been redesigned. A new framework has been proposed to improve and integrate the flow of patients from both inpatient and community settings, including: crisis assertive outreach clinicbased care homebased care. Preparatory work for implementation continues. The finalised MoC is expected to be fully implemented in early 2018. Under a separate proposed MoC, it is envisaged that the existing Adult Community Mental Health Service will incorporate the following functions: Access Assessment and Triage: Providing one centralised 24hour, sevenday referral line and assessment service for all new referrals. Acute Response and Intensive Home Treatment: Providing crisis resolution interventions that support hospital diversion and facilitate hospital discharges. Community Recovery Service: Providing continuing community clinical case management. Assertive Community Outreach Service: Supporting complex ongoing treatment engagement. Individual Therapies: Providing structured psychological therapies to c omplement clinical case management and existing group therapy programs. The new MoC will seek to further embed service values and principles based on recovery frameworks and best practice, in line with the 5th National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan (currently in draft). The key changes aim to increase capacity, efficiency and effectiveness of specialist secondary mental health services for people with mental illness complicated by significant psychosocial functional impairment, complexity and risk. Establishing one primary intake service is designed to provide a more equitable and standardised referral management service across the Territory. To enable a more targeted service to those who are most in need, there will also be an increased emphasis on a 'Stepped Care' approach. This approach links people with primary health and community support structures wherever possible. MHJHADS currently has two exciting Information Technology Projects underway to improve clinical care: Replacing the existing electronic clinical record for Mental Health and paper records for Alcohol and Drug Services and areas of Justice Health Service. The new MHJHADS Electronic Clinical Record system will provide a joint clinical record for services within the Division, to support coordinated care across the divisional service. The system is expected to be f ully implemented by the end of 2017. 111 With the support of ACT Corrective Services, installing the idose computerised methadone dosing system at the AMC. idose is currently used by the Alcohol and Drug Service at Canberra Hospital.

Performance against accountability indicators The HPS conducts surveillance for notifiable conditions as required under the Public Health Act 1997 . In 2016-17, all conditions notified to the HPS were followedup and investigated within routine protocols and guidelines. Where necessary, public health measures were put in place to limit the spread of disease in the ACT and the wider community. Data regarding notifiable conditions was collected and stored in the ACT notifiable diseases database. Forensic chemistry relies on highly trained and experienced staff to provide expert analysis and expert evidence that supports investigations into controlled substances. Full training of operational analysts routinely takes 18-24 months. Throughout 2012-16, a significant increase in sample numbers caused increasing resource pressure on the unit, resulting in a significant backlog in analysis by late 2015. A 2016-17 budget bid for additional staff provided funding for two staff for two years. These staff were recruited and employed by late 2016 with preliminary training immediately implemented. Health status evaluations and reports Population Health Protection and Prevention undertook the following population health surveys and data collections in 2016-17: The ACT General Health Survey (GHS), which is a telephone computer assisted technology household survey that collects information on a range of factors influencing health status. The ACT Secondary Students' Alcohol and Drug (ASSAD) Survey, which commenced in 23 secondary schools in Term 2, 2017. The aim of this survey is to provide information on the prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and drug use and other health risk factors among secondary students, aged 12-17 years. The Division has adopted two new methods of disseminating data and analysis so that it is of maximum use for practitioners, policymakers and the general public. These are: HealthStats ACT, which is an interactive web interface for ACT population health data and contains downloadable data for a range of health risk factors, diseases and specific populations the Focus On Reports, which are short reports focused on specific health topics and which present technical health data using accessible language and an accessible format.

Promote smoke-free areas The HPS has continued to undertake smokefree policy reforms to protect the community from second hand smoke. The SmokeFree Public Places Amendment Act 2016 was passed in March 2016. It streamlines the process of declaring new smokefree areas in the ACT. The initiative also supports the reduction of tobaccorelated harms through denormalising smoking and allows Canberrans to enjoy public amenities without exposure to secondhand smoke. In July 2016, ACT Health undertook community consultation on the proposal to establish smokefree areas around ACT Government owned public playgrounds. There was overwhelming support for this proposal and as of September 2016, all ACT Government managed play spaces were declared smokefree. 'No Smoking' signs were installed at all ACT Government managed parks outlining that smoking is prohibited w ithin 10 metres of play equipment. Interventions and mitigations Seasonal influenza activity is monitored using routine laboratory notifications of confirmed cases of influenza. In 2016, the influenza season in the ACT was larger than any season in the previous five years (2011-15). The HPS was notified of almost 1,600 cases of influenza, compared to an average of 779 cases reported for the same time period in the previous five years. In addition, a large number of institutional outbreaks of influenzalike illness (ILI) were reported when compared to previous years, with 19 outbreaks of ILI occurring in institutions across the ACT, compared to four in 2015 and eight in 2014. Of these, 17 were confirmed as being due to influenza. The HPS supports institutions experiencing an ILI notifiable outbreak by: providing advice regarding measures to control the spread of the disease, such as appropriate cleaning and isolation of sick people liaising with the facility daily for the duration of the outbreak. In 2016, antiviral medications were provided to residents and staff in three institutional outbreaks of influenza. Antiviral medications are used to treat viral infections such as influenza, but can also be used in an outbreak setting to prevent influenza infection in w ell people and limit the spread of disease. HPS assisted with the distribution of the antivirals to the facilities, which were provided from the ACT Health Medical stockpile and used in line with national guidelines. A large Salmonella outbreak was investigated by HPS in January and February 2017. Over 100 cases of gastroenteritis were reported among people who ate at the same food premises between 29 January and 14 February. Seventyfive of these people had confirmed Salmonella infections and 19 were hospitalised.

'No Smoking' signs were installed at all ACT Government managed parks outlining that smoking is prohibited within 1 0 metres of play equipment. Interventions and mitigations Seasonal influenza activity is monitored using routine laboratory notifications of confirmed cases of influenza. In 2016, the influenza season in the ACT was larger than any season in the previous five years (2011-15). The HPS was notified of almost 1,600 cases of influenza, compared to an average of 779 cases reported for the same time period in the previous five years. In addition, a large number of institutional outbreaks of influenzalike illness (ILI) were reported when compared to previous years, with 19 outbreaks of ILI occurring in institutions across the ACT, compared to four in 2015 and eight in 2014. Of these, 17 were confirmed as being due to influenza. The HPS supports institutions experiencing an ILI notifiable outbreak by: providing advice regarding measures to control the spread of the disease, such as appropriate cleaning and isolation of sick people liaising with the facility daily for the duration of the outbreak. In 2016, antiviral medications were provided to residents and staff in three institutional outbreaks of influenza. Antiviral medications are used to treat viral infections such as influenza, but can also be used in an outbreak setting to prevent influenza infection in well peopl e and limit the spread of disease. HPS assisted with the distribution of the antivirals to the facilities, which were provided from the ACT Health Medical stockpile and used in line with national guidelines. A large Salmonella outbreak was investigated by HPS in January and February 2017. Over 100 cases of gastroenteritis were reported among people who ate at the same food premises between 29 January and 14 February. Seventyfive of these people had confirmed Salmonella infections and 19 were hospitalised. ALL ACT GOVERNMENT MANAGED PLAY SPACES ARE NOW SMOKEFREE. ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17114 114 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Another unrelated outbreak of Salmonella was also investigated around the same time. Four people with confirmed Salmonella infections reported eating at the same food premises between 30 January and 2 February. Environmental Health Officers from HPS inspected both of the above premises. Both were found to have issues with food handling processes and were subsequently issued with prohibition notices, resulting in the temporary closure of both premises. A third Salmonella outbreak investigation was conducted in February and March 2017, with 11 cases eating at the same restaurant over a five week period. Several inspections of the premises did not identify any issues. Despite thorough epidemiological and environmental investigations, the source of that outbreak remains unknown. In May 2017, the annual Aged Care Forum was hosted by the HPS. Thirty people from 19 ACT aged care facilities attended the forum. Staff from across ACT Health presented information on: how to manage outbreaks of influenza and gastroenteritis other diseases relevant to the aged care setting influenza vaccinations that are available for both residents and staff. In addition to the forum, a respiratory swab collection workshop was funded by ACT Health and provided to aged care facility (ACF) staff. Having aged care staff trained in swab collection enables rapid diagnosis of the cause of illness, meaning that diseasespecific control measures can be implemented and the outbreak can be contained more quickly. The ACT Pharmacist Vaccination Standards were expanded on 22 June 2017, to authorise pharmacists to vaccinate against whooping cough using the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (dTpa) vaccine. This change means that pharmacists can help to reduce the spread and incidence of both the flu and whooping cough in the ACT. It also aligns the ACT with immunisation programs offered in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Victoria. The Medicines, Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation 2008 was amended on 1 August 2016, to enable prescribers to seek approval to prescribe a therapeutic class of controlled medicine(s) for a patient through a category approval system. The category approvals enable prescribers to increase or decrease doses and switch between medications within the limits, without having to seek approval each time. The limits for category approvals are set out under the Controlled Medicines Prescribing Standards, which came into effect on 15 September 2016. These changes have significantly improved administrative processing times within the HPS and enabled ACT Health to focus on public health monitoring a nd investigation activities. Health hazards and countermeasures Access Canberra and ACT Health have collaboratively developed a food business selfassessment tool that is available as an App so that it can be used on compatible electronic handheld devices. The selfassessment tool assists food business operators by enabling them to undertake an assessment of their current food safety practices and identify potential areas for improvement. The application provides detailed information about: common food safety and regulatory issues food business inspections. IN 201617, THE NUMBER OF FOOD HANDLERS COMPLETING THE I'M ALERT FOOD SAFETY 115 The effectiveness of current food business and community group engagement is demonstrated by the increased number of food handlers from food businesses and community groups that have conducted the online I'm Alert Food Safety training. During 2016-17, 8,936 food handlers conducted this training, which is an increase of over a 600 per cent from the previous year. The HPS attends a growing number of events in the ACT, from the Summernats to the National Multicultural Festival. In February 2017, a team of 12 public health officers conducted food inspections during the National Multicultural Festival, which is the ACT's largest food event. This was a strategy to minimise public health risks from serious breaches of the Food Act 2001. Over 350 inspections were conducted during the event. During food stall inspections, public health officers routinely look for issues (breaches) that lead to unacceptable food safety risks, including: inadequate temperature control poor hand washing facilities inappropriate food storage. A number of food safety breaches were identified, resulting in three seizures of food and 17 incidents of voluntary disposal of food. In December 2016, an extensive cleanup was conducted of an insanitary condition at a residential dwelling using the recent a mendments to regulatory processes under the Public Health Act 1997 . The property had an accumulation of food and other material in and around the house. The food was decaying and odorous, providing harbourage for vermin and impacting on neighbours. Ongoing monitoring of the property has continued since the clean up to monitor reoccurrence. Under the amended Public Health Act 1997 an abatement order for an insanitary condition is valid for 12 months. This allows the HPS to cleanup a reoccurrence of an insanitary condition on a premise with a valid abatement order. On 9 August 2016, the Public Health Amendment Act 2016 was passed by the Legislative Assembly. The aim of amendment is to improve public health management of insanitary conditions caused by hoarding and domestic squalor in the ACT. The amendments also provided the Minister with the power to create a code of practice that sets out guidelines for the Chief Health Officer. The code of practice will provide a flexible framework to allow government to better respond to the public health risks associated with insanitary conditions caused by hoarding and domestic squalor. It will also task the Hoarding Case Management Group, an independent advisory group, with the provision of operational advice on best practice management of hoarding and domestic squalor. Other achievements The Office of the Chief Health Officer (OCHO) undertook significant work to establish a Medicinal Cannabis Scheme in the ACT to facilitate safe and legal access to highquality medicinal cannabis products. Two expert committees, the Medicinal Cannabis Medical Advisory Panel (MCMAP) and the Medicinal Cannabis Advisory Group (MCAG) have been established to provide: highlevel advice on clinical guidelines and regulations advice to government on the broader economic, legal and social issues related to the introduction of the Scheme. New draft ACT prescribing standards for medicinal cannabis are being developed. The ACT Government is committed to ensuring that available medicines are safe and effective.

Promote smoke-free areas Following an announcement by the Minister for Health on 26 June 2017, the HPS is working with Transport Canberra and City Services to declare public transport waiting areas smokefree. Community consultation undertaken between February and April 2017 found that 93 per cent of respondents supported the proposal to declare transport waiting areas smokefree. Interventions and mitigations The HPS will continue to work with ACFs in the ACT to manage and prevent outbreaks of influenza. One strategy that will be further investigated is the supply and administration of seasonal influenza vaccine to ACF workers. Despite relatively high levels of vaccination in residents, poor rates of vaccination among staff (in whom the vaccine is more effective) contribute to an increased likelihood of influenza transmission. It is proposed t hat by offering seasonal vaccination to ACF workers (who are currently not eligible for funded vaccine under the National Immunisation Program), the vaccination coverage rate among this group will increase, resulting in a reduction in the number, duration and severity of influenza outbreaks in ACFs in the ACT. The ACT Government is committed to the principal of harm reduction. The OCHO has established a working group to examine the broader public health, legal and social issues related to the potential introduction of pill testing in the ACT. As various inquiries into harm reduction services progress, new issues will need to be considered. The current significant consultation and policy work will continue. The ACT Government has also committed to reducing barriers to registering for organ and tissue donation. ACT Labour has set an ambitious target of achieving a 90 per cent donation registration in Canberra. OCHO continues to work with government to: develop a coordinated and consistent approach to organ and tissue donation facilitate effective and efficient organ donation for transplantation. Health hazards and countermeasures Climate change impacts health both directly and indirectly. Population Health Protection and Prevention is participating in multiple interjurisdictional and interagency discussions about improving health outcomes in the fa ce of climate change. Examples include: monitoring air quality increasing community resilience to extreme heat improving fitness by encouraging active transport options that reduce carbon emissions. 117 ACT Health will continue to champion the one government approach by strengthening current inter governmental relationships and collaborative initiatives. For example, Access Canberra and ACT Health will jointly develop new industry guides and revise existing guides, such as the ACT Government Events Guide. As part of this approach, Access Canberra and ACT Health will aim to engage early with event organisers to support businesses to meet their regulatory obligations. This approach will also be adopted for the introduction of joint proactive food business site visits in 2017- 18. Proactive site visits are designed to improve compliance rates and provide an increased presence in the community. The aim of the visits is to discuss common food safety issues and inform food businesses of the tools that are available to assist them in achieving compliance. This will: complement current regulatory activities improve food safety by promoting a food safety culture in food businesses. OUTPUT 1.4: CANCER SERVICES Canberra Hospital and Health Services (CHHS) provides a comprehensive range of screening, assessment, diagnostic, treatment and palliative care services. Services are provided in inpatient, outpatient and community settings. The key strategic priorities for cancer care services are early detection and timely access to diagnostic and treatment services. These include: ensuring that population screening rates for breast cancer meet targets ensuring waiting time for access to essential services, such as radiotherapy, are consistent with agreed benchmarks increasing the proportion of women screened through the BreastScreen Australia program for the target population to 70 per cent over time.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17118 118 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Performance against accountability indicators During 2016-2017, projects have been undertaken to strengthen services by: improving the patient experience decreasing the length of inpatient stays improving timeliness of admissions improving patient flow across all inpatient and outpatient CACHS services. Outcomes that have been achieved to date are: decreased length of stay, in particular for Haematology patients improved timeliness of admissions improved patient flow in outpatients and screening clinics improved access to treatment information in patient files increased referrals from GPs to BreastScreen ACT improved Health Roundtable benchmarked data for haematology. Breast cancer screening BreastScreen ACT is funded by ACT Health and affiliated with the national program, BreastScreen Australia. BreastScreen ACT's access and uptake have had continued success during 2016-17 with: 100 per cent of women receiving screening results within 28 days for women requiring further investigation at an assessment clinic, 88 per cent were provided an appointment within 28 days from their initial breast screening appointment. Despite a comprehensive recruitment and promotion program, breast screening participation for the 50-69 years cohort in the ACT has remained steady at 56.4 per cent against the ACT target of 60 per cent. While the ACT rate of participation in breast screening is approximately two percent above t he national average and the third highest in the country, achieving the national target set by BreastScreen Australia of 70 per cent participation remains a challenge. BreastScreen ACT continues to actively promote this important program by: using Electoral Roll data to send invitations to women in the target age group sending routine rescreen invitation letters telephoning lapsed attendees and women who do not respond to invitation letters or who fail to attend appointments distributing information packs to all GPs in Canberra conducting community and professional information sessions staffing stalls at various conventions distributing additional resources. In January 2016, the program installed a new mammography and tomosynthesis machine in Civic. This stateoftheart technology has enabled the program to continue to detect the smallest of cancers using threedimensional imaging of the breast. 119 Cancer services The Rapid Assessment Unit (RAU) for Cancer Services provides an alternative access point for cancer patients, currently receiving or three months posttreatment, who require management of symptoms and side effects relating to their cancer and/or cancer treatment. This nurseled model, with a Nurse Practitioner and Advanced Practice Nurse, has resulted in: increased capacity to manage cancer patients outside of the Emergency Department reduced admissions improved access for patients. Radiation Oncology Technology capabilities are a critical component of the Radiation Therapy service. Major equipment at end oflife is being replaced, which will: provide further efficiencies for radiation therapy treatment planning and treatment delivery improve access to the service and to more current and targeted radiation therapy treatments, such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). A project is being conducted to expand the usage of the ARIA\u00ae oncology information system and improve integration of ARIA\u00ae with other ACT Health systems.

Continued patient participation in the Highly Conformal Hypofractionated Image Guided ('Stereotactic') Radiotherapy (CHISEL) clinical trial further consolidated our experience with the SABR clinical technique. Medical Oncology The Medical Oncology Department had several achievements this year, including increasing medical oncology consultant staff by a 1.5 Full Time Equivalents (FTEs). In addition, Medical Oncology participated with other bodies in research and development efforts. This included participating in an academic translational collaboration project with the Australian National University (ANU). This led to the development of a phase I clinical trial of intratumour injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant into solid human tumours. The first patient was enrolled in October 2016. Another translational collaboration with the University of Canberra in epigenetic targeting of metastatic breast cancer will lead to another phase I clinical trial, commencing in 2017. These studies are leading up to establishing a Canberra Region Cancer Centre (CRCC) Phase I Clinical Trials Unit. In addition, a scoping visit to the National Referral Hospital, Honiara Solomon Islands was conducted to review the local cancer services. Th is visit was conducted with the support of the John James Foundation. The department will play a key role in assisting this Pacific neighbour in establishing its own dedicated cancer unit. Ongoing work to decrease patients' length of stay included reviewing processes for weekend handover for medical staff and discharge planning. Palliative Care Cancer Services contributed to the Territorywide palliative care services by providing five specialist nurses and a Nurse Practitioner. Palliative carerelated medical specialist services are provided in conjunction with ACT Palliative Care. These have been enhanced in 2016 by the appointment of a new Palliative Care Specialist. In 2017 a trainee registrar position will be created for Canberra Hospital's palliative care. Close integration of these services with the ACTwide Palliative Care service is paramount. Palliative Care staff provide a highly valued consultation service across the Canberra Hospital campus to patients and their families, including those with nonmalignant conditions requiring complex symptom control. Other achievements In February 2017, the CRCC again held a threeday World Cancer Day event. The Canberra community and health professionals were invited to participate in the event, which provided: cancer information sessions GP education evening daily tours of the CRCC the op portunity to browse approximately 30 supporter stalls. 121 All events over the three days were very well attended and supported. The BreastScreen Team was presented with an ACT Quality in Health Award in the category of Consumer Participation. This was awarded for research the program undertook to determine the enablers and barriers to mammography screening by ACT resident women aged 50-74 years. In addition, the Immunology Unit received the highest level of accreditation from the Joint College Training in Immunology and Allergy. Other awards in the Division included: At the 2017 ACT Excellence Awards for Nurses and Midwives, James Slade, Clinical Nurse Specialist, was named 2017 ACT Nurse of the Year and the RAU was awarded the ACT Nursing and Midwifery Team of the year. Kerryn Ernst was awarded a Public Service Medal for outstanding public service to community health in the ACT. Kerryn's work as a McGrath Breast Care Nurse has been recognised and is appreciated by all those that she works for and works with. Future directions Cancer Services In 2017-18, Cancer Services will focus on: maintaining highquality, safe care for all patients implementing other improvements to improve the experiences of patients and clinical staff. Highquality, safe care will be maintained for all patients by r eviewing and evaluating current MoCs, including: the Palliative Care consultation service model, which will be reviewed as part of the development of a Territorywide model the role of the Clinical Nurse Specialists' expertise to inform and progress shared care models further expanding the RAU. Efforts to improve the patient experience and timeliness of care are being progressed, including: continuing the Lean Oncology projects to further reduce patients' length of stay and increase capacity in the outpatient setting reviewing the multidisciplinary team meeting processes to ensure as many patients as possible can be reviewed by the teams in a timely and efficient way implementing the Optimal Cancer Care Pathways (developed by Cancer Australia) for lung cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia implementing a targeted exercise program for patients who have lengthy admissions to ensure these patients maintain physical function and muscle strength trialling art therapy for inpatients and outpatients. Regular forums and space will continue to be provided for clinical staff to collect their ideas for improving the patient experience and developing improvements in care. Cancer Services will also continue to develop and implement clinics, including: the anaesthetic allergy clinic the Sarcoidosis clinic 121 120 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 progressing the integration of ARIA, Radiation Oncology Clinical Information Management System with other CHHS applications implementing paperreduced external beam treatment and planning to improve efficiencies and achieve cost savings. Continued patient participation in the Highly Conformal Hypofractionated Image Guided ('Stereotactic') Radiotherapy (CHISEL) clinical trial further consolidated our experience with the SABR clinical technique. Medical Oncology The Medical Oncology Department had several achievements this year, including increasing medical oncology consultant staff by a 1.5 Full Time Equivalents (FTEs). In addition, Medical Oncology participated with other bodies in research and development efforts. This included participating in an academic translational collaboration project with the Australian National University (ANU). This led to the development of a phase I clinical trial of intratumour injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant into solid human tumours. The first patient was enrolled in October 2016. Another translational collaboration with the University of Canberra in epigenetic targeting of metastatic breast cancer will lead to another phase I clinical trial, commencing in 2017. These studies are leading up to establishing a Canberra Region Cancer Centre (CRCC) Phase I Clinical Trials Unit. In addition, a scoping visit to the National Referral Hospital, Honiara Solomon Islands was conducted to r eview the local cancer services. This visit was conducted with the support of the John James Foundation. The department will play a key role in assisting this Pacific neighbour in establishing its own dedicated cancer unit. Ongoing work to decrease patients' length of stay included reviewing processes for weekend handover for medical staff and discharge planning. Palliative Care Cancer Services contributed to the Territorywide palliative care services by providing five specialist nurses and a Nurse Practitioner. Palliative carerelated medical specialist services are provided in conjunction with ACT Palliative Care. These have been enhanced in 2016 by the appointment of a new Palliative Care Specialist. In 2017 a trainee registrar position will be created for Canberra Hospital's palliative care. Close integration of these services with the ACTwide Palliative Care service is paramount. Palliative Care staff provide a highly valued consultation service across the Canberra Hospital campus to patients and their families, including those with nonmalignant conditions requiring complex symptom control. Other achievements In February 2017, the CRCC again held a threeday World Cancer Day event. The Canberra community and health professionals were invited to participate in the event, which provided: cancer information sessions GP education evening daily tours of the CRCC the opportunity to browse approximately 30 supporter stalls. 121 All events over the three days were very well attended and supported. The BreastScreen Team was presented with an ACT Quality in Health Award in the category of Consumer Participation. This was awarded for research the program undertook to determine the enablers and barriers to mammography screening by ACT resident women aged 50-74 years. In addition, the Immunology Unit received the highest level of accreditation from the Joint College Training in Immunology and Allergy. Other awards in the Division included: At the 2017 ACT Excellence Awards for Nurses and Midwives, James Slade, Clinical Nurse Specialist, was named 2017 ACT Nurse of the Year and the RAU was awarded the ACT Nursing and Midwifery Team of the year. Kerryn Ernst was awarded a Public Service Medal for outstanding public service to community health in the ACT. Kerryn's work as a McGrath Breast Care Nurse has been recognised and is appreciated by all those that she works for and works with.

Regular forums and space will continue to be provided for clinical staff to collect their ideas for improving the patient experience and developing improvements in care. Cancer Services will also continue to develop and implement clinics, including: the anaesthetic allergy clinic the Sarcoidosis clinic ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17122 122 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 a joint Immunology/Ophthalmology uveitis clinic continuing the trial of the Older Person's Oncology clinic, which combines medical oncology, geriatric and social work services into a single clinic. A Cancer Australia grant of $574,009 will be used to conduct an AUTOCHECK study. This study will investigate the molecular determinants of adverse autoimmunity and immunerelated events in advanced cancer patients who have been treated with immune check point inhibitors. In 2017, Canberra Clinical Genomics will begin providing services to Immunology, Oncology and Haematology. A new inpatient area that will colocate all inpatients in a purposebuilt refurbished area in Building 3 at Canberra Hospital will be designed and developed. The Breast Cancer Shared Followup Care Program will continue to be promoted. The program involves the person, their GP and specialist and a Breast Care Clinical Nurse Consultant, to provide the best care after a person has finished cancer treatment. It recognises that there are opportunities at the end of treatment to support women to live well, by: developing a followup care plan for the person implementing a shared followup care arrangement between specialists and GPs. Radiation Oncology Radiation remains an important modality for cancer treatment. With improved clini cal outcomes of cancer treatment and increased survival rates, minimising radiation therapyrelated toxicities becomes a priority. To support this, future directions for Radiation Oncology include: further developing the advanced IMRT treatment Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT), which provides more precise targeting of the tumour and spares normal tissues, thus minimising related toxicities progressing the implementation of a replacement treatment planning system, which will support more complex planning techniques and provide system efficiencies continuing to develop SRS techniques for metastatic spinal disease commissioning and clinically releasing software that provides planning and treatment delivery efficiencies for cranial SRS with multiple targets developing a business case to obtain funding for the replacement of endoflife Linear Accelerators, which will provide stateof-the art treatment delivery and imaging modalities further investigating the feasibility of expanding the brachytherapy service to: provide intraoperative brachytherapy for breast cancer use threedimensional printing to produce surface moulds to treat skin cancer further increasing participation in clinical trials and translational biological laboratory research studies. In addition, the clinical release of VMAT treatment of prostate cancer is expected by October 2017. VMAT provides improved efficiencies by reducing treatment delivery times, which will provide increased access to r adiation therapy services. Radiation Oncology will continue developing the following clinical projects: expanding the Stereotactic Radiosurgery/Radiotherapy service to include extra cranial treatment sites expanding verification imaging capabilities, including developing a credentialing program expanding the application of IMRT to include prostate cancer treatment 123 expanding the use of the oncology information management system continuing to develop scripting to further automate radiotherapy treatment planning system processes and provide process efficiencies increasing access to IMRT in Radiation Oncology from the current 16.7 percent of patients to the recommended 30 to 40 per cent, depending on clinical case mix. Breast cancer screening The Expanded Target Age Group Project, which promotes screening to women aged 70-74 years, has entered the final year of current funding. The participation rate in this cohort has increased from 33.2 per cent in July 2014 to 54.7 per cent in June 2017. Commonwealth funding will be provided to extend the program for a further four years. Community Engagement World Cancer Day in February 2017 provided an opportunity to highlight what each of us and the CRCC, can do to reduce the impact of cancer on our community. The theme for 2017 is 'We Can, I Can'. It aims to explore how everyone can contribute to reducing the impacts of cancer by achieving greater equity in cancer care and making fighting cancer a priority. Medical Oncology Cancer Australia has developed 13 Optimal Cancer Care Pathways (OCCPs) and all jurisdictions in Australia have commenced implementation of the OCCPs. The CRCC h as identified lung cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia as the first OCCPs to implement. Progress to date has been reported to the National Cancer Expert Reference Group. Palliative Care A Paediatric Palliative Care MoC has been developed and will be implemented in the second half of 2017. This is a nurseled service that brings together the services required to support families in the ACT who are caring for children and young people with life limiting illnesses. OUTPUT 1.5: REHABILITATION, AGED AND COMMUNITY CARE The aim of Output 1.5 is to provide an integrated, effective and timely response to rehabilitation, aged care and community care services in inpatient, outpatient, Emergency Department, subacute and community based settings. The key strategic priorities for Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care (RACC) are: ensuring that access is consistent with clinical need, is timely for community based nursing and allied health services and that community based services are in place or planned to better provide for the acute and postacute healthcare needs of the community ensuring that hospitalised older persons wait an appropriate time for access to a comprehensive assessment by the ACT Health's Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT), which assists in their approval to access appropriate support in the com munity when available, including residential accommodation.

Contact details: For more information, email HEALTHACT@act.gov.au. Overview Throughout 2016-17, RACC continued to implement the Commonwealth's aged care reforms. ACAT undertakes comprehensive aged care assessments for the ACT region for older people seeking to access ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17124 124 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Commonwealth subsidised aged care services. Hospitals within the ACT region send all referrals for both hospitalsbased assessments and nonurgent home services to the My Aged Care Portal. The ACT ACAT link to My Aged Care processes these referrals on a daily basis. The Commonwealth Key Performance Indicator (KPI) to complete a client assessment in either a public or private hospital is between three and 14 days. ACT Health met this KPI in 2016-17. To improve performance and client outcomes, bimonthly meetings occur between RACC staff and representatives from the My Aged Care Regional Assessment Service (RAS). During the reporting period, RACC continued working with eligible participants and National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) staff to provide ongoing support of the scheme. In line with the scheme's national rollout program, the full NSW implementation began on 1 July 2017. RACC also worked with those eligible participants to optimise continuum of services. RACC continued to provide services and equipment funding in line with existing eligibility criteria for clients who are ineligible to access the scheme and for those aged 65 years and over. Performance against accountability indicators Community nursing and allied health targets were achieved within a 5 per cent variance to the end of M ay 2017, achieving: 92,749 nursing occasions of service, against a target of 90,000 28,920 allied health regional services, against a target of 30,000. Hospitalised older persons RACC currently supports 44 inpatient beds at Canberra Hospital for older people, including: 26 acute beds in the Acute Care of the Elderly Unit (Ward 11A) 10 subacute and eight nonacute beds in Ward 11B. In December 2016, patients from Ward 11A were relocated to the 20bed ward in Ward 4B, Building 1 to allow Ward 11A to be refurbished. This refurbishment will feature the principles of an enabling environment meaning: the inpatient environment will be safe and secure by allowing easy access and orientation that promotes independence e.g. the environment will be less clinical and threatening the furnishings and fittings will also be consistent with dementia principles, e.g. using colour contrast to assist patients with impaired vision. The refurbishment will also allow six Geriatric Special Carespecific beds to be established. The total number of Geriatric Medicine beds has remained consistent at 44 beds. In early 2017, the Geriatric Service established the Geriatric Assessment and Planning Unit (GAPU), a six bed unit adjacent to Ward 11B to facilitate transfers from the Emer gency Department to Geriatric Medicine. A dedicated GAPU medical team is available during normal working hours and comprises a consultant and a registrar. Geriatric patients who present to the Emergency Department are first assessed in the unit and then moved to other appropriate areas, such as acute or subacute geriatric units. Comprehensive geriatric assessment and planning now occurs in a dedicated area. Comparison with the previous year suggests a significant reduction in the length of stay without any adverse effect on the quality of care. A number of other improvements to care for hospitalised elderly patients have been introduced, which are discussed below. 125 Falls Minimisation rooms have been established. They have been designed to reduce the risk of falls for those patients who have been: admitted following a fall or assessed as being at high risk of a fall. These fourbed rooms in Ward 11B and Ward 11A have a dedicated Assistant in Nursing, working under the supervision of a Registered Nurse (RN), to ensure patients are observed continuously and provided with interaction/diversion activities. The Falls and Falls Injury Prevention service has begun Staying Active exercise classes, which is a sixweek strength and balance program. The exercises are in line with evidenced based practice principles for falls prevention. Two classes are run per week with 6-10 clients per class. Improvements in food services were developed to provide a more appropriate service that better caters for the needs of the elderly. This service has worked in partnership with the food services team and includes dedicated food service staff for this area. Having dedicated and trained food service staff who are familiar with the patients has been important for helping patients with cognitive impairment as these staff are able to interact with patients in a more engaging and meaningful manner, for example: providing words of encouragement opening packets/drinks or placing a straw in a drink. In October 2016, RACC established an Aged Services Emergency Team Nurse in the Emergency Department. The primary role is to review all patient presentations aged 85 years and over who are likely to be discharged home. The aim is to decrease unnecessary admissions and allow geriatric syndromes to be identified early, e.g. delirium. The nurse works collaboratively with Emergency Department staff and the Rehab at Home and Rapid Assessment of the Deteriorating Aged at Risk (RADAR) teams to enable a patient's timely and safe discharge from the Emergency Department. The Dementia Care in Hospitals Program (DCHP) has now been implemented in 14 Canberra Hospital wards. The program aims to reduce the negative impact of dementia and other forms of cognitive impairment on the patient, families/carers and the health care system. Negative impacts include: poorer health outcomes events that pose a risk to patient safety increased length of hospital stay. The DCHP links increased awareness of and education about cognitive impairment, delirium and dementia and the need for carer support to a bedside alert for cognitive impairment called the Cognitive Impairment Identifier. Widespread education has be en provided to groups including clinical staff of varying disciplines, as well as nonclinical support staff who interact with patients. The Orthogeriatrics Service for older patients with hip fractures has been enhanced. This Model of Care (MoC) is a comanagement model that brings geriatricians and orthopaedic surgeons together to provide improved care of older patients with hip fractures. Providing comprehensive geriatric assessments and ongoing geriatric support throughout a patient's stay in hospital aims to reduce the incidence of delirium and thus shorten people's length of stay in hospital. 125 124 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Commonwealth subsidised aged care services.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17126 126 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Access to services In response to the demand for communitybased allied health services, such as nutrition, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, a number of changes have been introduced in the Models of Care (MoCs), including: The RACC Occupational Therapy service is utilising electronic software to draw home modifications, which ensures compliance with National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) requirements and improves the accuracy of dimensions. Providing sitebased food deliveries has improved access to community nutrition services for renal patients. Dieticians are colocated with community renal units at Tuggeranong and Belconnen Community Health Centres. Presentations to the WiCs in Belconnen and Tuggeranong continue to increase, with the growth in Belconnen being especially significant in 2016-17. The number of clients who did not wait remains low. The top presentations for the WiCs for 2016-17 were: urinary tract infections common colds wound dressings wounds and lacerations ear conditions skin conditions musculorskeletal conditions gastro diarrhoea gastro vomiting Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) conditions upper respiratory tract infections, i.e. sore throats. WiCs provide the public with an alternative to attending an Emergency Department for minor illnesses and injuries. Rehabilitation In 2016-17, the positive influence of the Canberra Hospital Acute Subacute Early Reha bilitation Service (CHASERS) was realised. The CHASERS team has improved the triaging and fast tracking of acute patients into appropriate subacute services. The CHASERS provides a multidisciplinary leadership approach and aims to create a more proactive model of rehabilitation and prevent functional decline in patients through early intervention. The key changes that were implemented include establishing a Rehabilitation Leadership Group, with multidisciplinary team representation. The group works collaboratively with the acute care health teams. Access to the rehabilitation units has improved while the length of stay in an inpatient rehabilitation unit has reduced. The Social Work Team have established a Mindfulness Group for carers. This initiative is in response to an identified need to assist carers from the Community Rehabilitation Team and Ward 12B to cope with stress and increase wellbeing. The group is run over four weeks, two hours per week and has received positive feedback from participants. In addition to this project, implementing the first Allied Health Assistant Social Work course in the ACT has seen Allied Health Assistant (AHA) social work students undertaking their placements within RACC. 127 Junior physiotherapy rotational positions have expanded across all RACC services and now provide: mixed skill sets improved communication and knowledge between services more opportunities for professional development. The physiotherapy new graduate intake has proven successful, with four new graduates currently completing their first year in RACC. Over the last 12 months the wait time for suitable clients to access the Community Rehabilitation Team (CRT) was consistently less than four weeks. Other achievements In November 2016, Dr Chris Katsogiannis received an award for outstanding innovation for his presentation on the implementation of CHASERS. Key achievements by the CHASERS model include reducing the average length of stay for: impairment episodes at Canberra Hospital stroke episodes at Calvary's ACRU. The award recognises the work undertaken by the Rehabilitation Leadership Group in 2016 to: realign the current consult and ward teambased models develop the CHASERS model to address the long average length of stay in Canberra Hospital Rehabilitation Units and facilitate patient flow from Acute to Subacute Services. Future directions The Commonwealth Government announced further reforms to aged care services in the 2015-16 ACT Budget, including a commitment to developing a MoC that: combines Commonwealth Home Support Program (CHSP) services and home c are packages into a single home care program or clearly aligns a level of home care service with identified care needs. RACC will continue to adapt our service model in response to these reforms. Upgrades to the My Aged Care system continue on a twice yearly basis, including: implementing system enhancements developing new forms updating information on the My Aged Care website. RACC continues to work with the Commonwealth to ensure appropriate education is provided on these new initiatives to staff and consumers. The Social Work Team have engaged with Legal Aid ACT. Work has begun to develop and establish a legal outreach service at Canberra Hospital, with a small grant acquired by Legal Aid. The service is a 12month pilot and will provide duty advice to community members and patients, particularly elderly clients. Hospitalised older persons It is anticipated that with the current ageing population, the demand for hospital beds by older patients will continue to increase. Partnerships with stakeholders, such as Capital Health Network, will continue to be strengthened to facilitate seamless care across various care settings.

The award recognises the work undertaken by the Rehabilitation Leadership Group in 2016 to: realign the current consult and ward teambased models develop the CHASERS model to address the long average length of stay in Canberra Hospital Rehabilitation Units and facilitate patient flow from Acute to Subacute Services. Future directions The Commonwealth Government announced further reforms to aged care services in the 2015-16 ACT Budget, including a commitment to developing a MoC that: combines Commonwealth Home Support Program (CHSP) services and home care p ackages into a single home care program or clearly aligns a level of home care service with identified care needs. RACC will continue to adapt our service model in response to these reforms. Upgrades to the My Aged Care system continue on a twice yearly basis, including: implementing system enhancements developing new forms updating information on the My Aged Care website. RACC continues to work with the Commonwealth to ensure appropriate education is provided on these new initiatives to staff and consumers. The Social Work Team have engaged with Legal Aid ACT. Work has begun to develop and establish a legal outreach service at Canberra Hospital, with a small grant acquired by Legal Aid. The service is a 12month pilot and will provide duty advice to community members and patients, particularly elderly clients. Hospitalised older persons It is anticipated that with the current ageing population, the demand for hospital beds by older patients will continue to increase. Partnerships with stakeholders, such as Capital Health Network, will continue to be strengthened to facilitate seamless care across various care settings. Throughout 2017-18, strategies will ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17128 128 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 continue to be developed to improve the care of patients who are admitted to hospital with behavioural and psychology symptoms of dementia. Discharge planning The new national system for prioritising access to home care has negatively impacted the availability of packages for patients when discharging from hospital. This has been a challenging time for clinicians, patients and families. Significant wait times continue to be experienced by some patients when accessing supported accommodation and home modification services. In addition, carer needs are increasing. RACC will continue to work collaboratively with the NDIA regarding long stay patients whose discharge is reliant on the NDIS. RACC will also continue to strengthen the outpatient rehabilitation strategies introduced in 2015-16 for patients experiencing a long length of stay, supporting patients to continue rehabilitation outside the inpatient setting. This includes increasing referrals to: ambulatory services, including subacute services such as Community Rehabilitation Service or Rehab@Home service or community based services. Access to services The University of Canberra Public Hospital (UCPH) is currently being constructed and is due to be completed by June 2018. Clinical Services will be in place to provide care in early July 2018. Extensive planning has gone into ensuring that the patient spaces support the MoC by providing the best thera peutic space. This includes the innovative use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions to future proof the potential of UCPH. Throughout 2017-18, medical, nursing, allied health and administrative staff will concentrate on how clinical practice can be undertaken in a safe and effective way in a subacute facility that does not have acute supports. Research will be an important part of UCPH. The collaborative relationship with University of Canberra will be enhanced, including increasing the opportunity for combined research projects. Rehabilitation Changes are being made to existing services at the Rehabilitation and Independent Living Unit (RILU) and the CRT to: streamline their move to UCPH adapt the MoC for this location. RILU has successfully moved to a day patient model and CRT are reviewing patient management with the aim of developing a more open and adaptable framework. In February 2018, a further five physiotherapy graduates will be recruited to RACC as part of the rotation program. The ACT Domiciliary Oxygen and Respiratory Support Scheme, with representatives from the Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, has commenced a trial of portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) to determine their viability as a possible alternative to portable oxygen cylinders. T he first clinic was held in April 2017. The trial is expected to finish in late 2017. CLINICAL SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE AT THE UCPH FROM JULY 2018. 129 OUTPUT 1.6: EARLY INTERV ENTION AND PREVENTION The aim of Output 1.6 is to improve the health and wellbeing of the ACT population through a range of programs, services and initiatives, focused on early intervention, prevention and health promotion. The key strategic priorities for early intervention and prevention include: encouraging and promoting healthy lifestyle choices to decrease the rates of conditions, such as obesity and diabetes and reduce risky health behaviours, such as smoking and alcohol consumption maintaining high levels of immunisation.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17130 130 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 The ACT Chief Health Officer is the principal technical advisor on the Steering Committee. The Population Health Protection and Prevention Division chairs the ACT HWI Food Environment Implementation Group (FEIG). On 8 September 2016, following extensive community consultation, the ACT Government announced a range of measures to change the way unhealthy food and drinks are marketed, particularly towards children and encourage healthier choices. The FEIG is overseeing the implementation of the measures, which focus on working collaboratively with sporting clubs, businesses and ACT venues and events in an effort to keep Canberra healthy. Further details relating to the expansion of this work are provided in Future directions, page 132. The Population Health Protection and Prevention Division is responsible for the overarching evaluation of the HWI. The second HWI Progress Report focuses on policy and programlevel activities implemented in the 2016-17 financial year. It was prepared jointly with the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate (CMTEDD) and released publicly on 30 June 2017. The report found continued progress towards meeting at least seven of the 14 HWI health targets. Key results from the updated data include: obesity and overweight rates in ACT kindergarten children have not increased the proportion o f children regularly consuming sugary drinks continues to reduce on average children are eating enough fruit some progress has been achieved in increasing the proportion of children walking and cycling to school. While the results are positive, meeting and maintaining the longterm target of zero growth in the overweight and obesity rates will require ongoing effort. Key informant interviews with 33 HWI stakeholders were conducted in 2016 to gain insight into how the wholeofgovernment partnership is assisting the ACT Government to achieve its HWI objectives. Findings will be used to further strengthen the wholeofgovernment approach. The Population Health Protection and Prevention Division developed guidance materials to support the ACT Government's restriction of unhealthy food and drink marketing on ACTION buses. Arrangements were introduced in 2016 with bus advertising provider, Go Transit, to ensure that ACTION bus advertisements promote food and drink choices in accordance with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and associated Australian Guide to Healthy Eating . In 2016, ACT Health commissioned a review to assess the impact of the ACT's mandatory kilojoule display laws in guiding consumers towards healthier (lower kilojoule) choices in standard food outlets. The review found that, of the respondents who h ad purchased food from an outlet displaying kilojoule information, the purchasing decisions of 15 per cent were influenced \"a little\" or \"a lot\" by the kilojoule displays. Twentyseven per cent of respondents knew that the average daily energy intake is approximately 8,700 kilojoules. Overall, the review found that consumers are generally aware of the requirement for kilojoule displays and are supportive of the laws. ACT Health is working collaboratively under the Council of Australian Governments' Health Council to consider collective action that could improve children's health by limiting the promotion and availability of unhealthy food and drinks. The settings based programs delivered by the Health Improvement Branch (HIB) continue to deliver positive results, with the following highlights. The Kids at Play Active Play Program is delivered in Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) settings. It aims to increase the skills of educators in the ECEC sector to promote active play and fundamental movement skills to children aged three to five years. 131 The Ride or Walk to School (RWTS) Program is delivered to schools in partnership with the Physical Activity Foundation. It is designed to encourage more students to travel actively to school. A recent evaluation of the RWTS Program found that it has been successful in increasing the rates of active travel among primary school students involved in the program. As of 30 June 2017, 64 ACT schools are participating in the RWTS Program, reaching approximately 27,000 students. The RWTS Program won the Bike Culture and Behaviour Change category of the Cycling Promotion Fund's national 2017 Cycling Luminaries Award. The Fresh Tastes: healthy food at school Program supports ACT primary schools to: improve children's knowledge of, access to and consumption of healthy food and drinks implement relevant school food and drink policies, e.g. the ACT Public School Food and Drink Policy. As of 30 June 2017, 80 schools had signed up to the program reaching approximately 31,500 students. During 2017, the first cohort of Fresh Tastes schools completed their third year of participation in the program. It's Your Move (IYM) focuses on studentled innovation in ACT high schools. IYM began as a twoyear (2012-14) obesity prevention research program in thre e intervention schools in the ACT, using a systems approach. Two of the three schools achieved statistically significant reductions in the proportion of students who were overweight or obese. A further nine schools developed IYM activities in 2015-16. From the beginning of the 2017 school year, more than 100 students from six high schools were studying Entrepreneurs: It's Your Move. This program uses new and unique curriculum materials to teach students how to use systems approaches and design thinking to lead health improvement in their school community. More than 3,000 high school students have been influenced by these projects. One of the IYM private sector partners, ThinkPlace, won the Service Design - Education Services category at the Australian Good Design Awards. Early intervention and prevention programs The Population Health Protection and Prevention Division continued to oversee and coordinate the ACT Cervical Screening Program. The program aims to encourage women in the ACT aged 20-69 years who have been sexually active at any stage of their lives to have cervical screening tests every two years. Immunisation rates The Population Health Protection and Prevention Division worked with the Commonwealth Department of Health to implement new programs under the National Immunisation Program (NIP). On 1 November 2016, the shingles v accine Zostavax\u00ae was funded under the NIP for all adults aged 70 years, with a single catchup dose available for adults aged 71-79. The catch up program continues until 31 October 2021. In support of this program, ACT Health has since distributed more than 14,000 doses of Zostavax\u00ae and promotional materials to GPs throughout Canberra. THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING IN THE RWTS PROGRAM INCREASED FROM 52 TO 64. THE PROGRAM NOW REACHES APPROXIMATELY 27,000 STUDENTS, UP FROM 20,000 STUDENTS IN 2015-16. THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING IN THE FRESH TASTES PROGRAM INCREASED FROM 63 TO 80. THE PROGRAM NOW REACHES APPROXIMATELY 31,500 STUDENTS, UP FROM 24,500 STUDENTS IN 2015-16. 131 130 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 The ACT Chief Health Officer is the principal technical advisor on the Steering Committee.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17132 132 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) expanded from 1 September 2016 to become the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). The register is now a wholeoflife register, allowing immunisation providers to record vaccines administered to patients of any age on the register. Since the introduction of the Commonwealth's No Jab No Pay policy on 1 January 2016, which links family assistance payments to immunisation status, ACT Health has continued to manage an increase in demand for transcriptions of overseas immunisation records. In addition, during 2016-17, over 2,700 vaccines were distributed to immunisation providers as part of vaccine catchup schedules for individuals under 20 years. The ACT Antenatal Pertussis Vaccination Program continued through 2016-17. This program provides a free pertussiscontaining vaccine for women from 28 weeks of pregnancy. The program aims to protect both mother and newborn from the effects of whooping cough. An evaluation of the program was conducted by ACT Health in October 2016. The results indicate the program has been well received, with an estimated 75 per cent of pregnant women being immunised with pertussis vaccine. Immunisation educational activities have continued during 2016-17, with the Capital Health Network engaged to facilitate an Immunisation Education Program for immunisation pro viders on behalf of ACT Health. During 2016-17, four evening seminars were held. Each session was attended by between 110 and 170 health professionals to hear expert speakers present a range of topics, including: August 2016: Clinical theory and rationale of immunisation and local issues and developments October 2016: Shingles vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae); vaccines in pregnancy; and recommended vaccines not currently on the NIP March 2017: Influenza; adverse events and active surveillance May 2017: Improving vaccination rates; and vaccines for at risk groups. Staff of Population Health Protection and Prevention Division continued opportunistic outreach immunisation education for a variety of audiences, including: at the Capital Health Network orientation for new practice nurses at Capital Health Network Nurse Network meetings new and post graduate paediatric nursing students Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) enrolled nursing students midwifery staff within the maternity units at the major hospitals the Mums and Bubs group at Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service. Future directions Promoting healthy lifestyle choices In accordance with the ACT Government's 2016 election commitment, a priority in the coming year will be developing a comprehensive Preventative Health Strategy. The strategy will promote healthy choices and behaviours, focusing on addressing the risk factors of: smoking harmful alcohol consumption obesity poor nutrition physical inactivity. A $4 million funding pool will be established to invest in delivering prevention initiatives. 133 Transitioning effectively from the HWI to a broader Preventative Health Strategy will require planning to ensure that progress under the HWI in stabilising the rates of overweight and obesity in the ACT is maintained as the ACT Government's preventative health agenda is expanded. Building on the success of the 2016 pilot project, the ACT Government also announced an expansion of the local business engagement program. The pilot, which was undertaken in partnership with the Canberra Business Chamber, showed that consumers want choice and that businesses can introduce healthier food and drinks without damaging their bottom line. Work to meet targets associated with Fresh Tastes: healthy food at school and IYM, as identified in the 2017-18 ACT Budget will continue. The targets specify that by 30 June 2018: 300 teachers are to complete Food&ME training, as part of Fresh Tastes 12 new and existing schools are to be recruited to the IYM program. Early intervention and prevention programs The Australian Government is leading the renewal of the National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP) and the implementation of a new National Cancer Screening Register. The ACT Cervical Screening Register data will be transferred to the new National Register in late 2017. The Population Health Protection and Prevention Division will c ontinue to work closely with the Australian Government to implement the new NCSP, which includes implementing a new Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) test to be offered every five years to women aged 25-74 years. Immunisation rates The immunisation coverage rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the ACT continue to fluctuate. ACT Health will continue to implement a number of activities to increase awareness and promote immunisation, including: mailing postcards to families reminding them that their child's next immunisation is due developing a variety of promotional materials, including posters and pamphlets liaising with healthcare providers and other government agencies to discuss approaches for increasing rates. ACT Health will continue to engage with the Commonwealth Government on the proposed No Jab No Play legislation announced by the Prime Minister on 11 March 2017. 133 132 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) expanded from 1 September 2016 to become the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR).

Action Recommendation 12 - Agreed ACT Health agrees to monitor the progress of new graduate nurses to determine any negative effects from 12 month employment contracts. In the February 2015 to February 2016 new graduate nurse programs (Transition to Practice Programs), the total number of Enrolled Nurses was seven and there were 51 Registered Nurses. Upon successful completion of the program, all Enrolled Nurses were 135 Reporting Entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing, Community and Social Services reemployed and 47 Registered Nurses of the 51 whose contracted ceased after 12 months, were reemployed. ACT Health does not believe there have been any negative effects on the graduate nurses since moving the employment of graduates to 12 month contracts. The EN and RN programs remain competitive attracting many applications from local graduates as well as many from interstate. Recommendation 13 - Agreed ACT Health agrees to evaluate attitudes to diversity and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through the inclusion of specific questions in its next Workplace Culture Survey provisionally scheduled for late 2018 and will report the findings in the ACT Heath Annual Report following the next survey. Recommendation 14 - Agreed The previous whole of Government Indigenous Traineeship was coordinated through OATSIA in the Community Services Directorate. The last program was undertaken in 2012 2013 and had 13 Trainees. ACT Health had three placements, two completed the traineeship, and one withdrew. The whole of Government Indigenous Traineeship Program is now being coordinated through the Workforce Capability and Governance Division in CMTEDD. ACT Health has taken on one Trainee within the People Strategy and S ervices Branch. Reviews of previous Indigenous traineeships identify that some of the reasons for trainees not completing programs was the lack of support, development and pastoral care. This is one of the key areas of support focussed on by the coordinators of the program and the workplace in new traineeships. The new ACTPS Indigenous Traineeship commenced in August 2015 with permanent positions available to the trainees on completion of the traineeship. There are 11 trainees across the ACTPS and one is employed by ACT Health. Several of the unsuccessful applicants from the ACTPS selection process also identified as having a disability, have been contacted and encouraged to apply for the Disability Inclusion Employment Traineeship that is proposed in 201617. The new Indigenous Traineeship Program allows for a variety of certification qualifications to be achieved based upon the needs of both the individual trainee and the directorate that the trainee will be placed with upon completion of the traineeship. An Alumni will also be created to accurately show the success of trainees if they move on from the program. The next whole of Government Indigenous Traineeship is proposed to start in 2016 17. Action Last calendar year ACT Health placed six Aus tralian School Based Apprentices (ASBAs) within the People Strategy and Services Branch, three identifying as Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander and three identifying with a disability. One of the Indigenous apprentice left the program early to undertake a university bridging course that would assist with starting university earlier to undertake nursing studies. The remaining five apprentices completed and graduated the program. Currently ACT Health has two apprentices identifying as having a disability. Work is being undertaken to secure more placements within ACT Health. This is in line with the creation of an ASBA register pool, for areas/units within ACT Health to obtain potential placements in their areas. Recommendation 15 - Agreed The ACT Health Promotion Grants Program will include a question in the application forms of both the Health Promotion Innovation Fund and Healthy Canberra Grants requesting information on other grants applied for. This will commence with the next Health Promotion Innovation Fund closing on 20 October 2016. 135 134 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 B.3 SCRUTINY INTRODUCTION ACT Health responds to requests from ACT Legislative Assembly Committees, including reports automatically referred from the ACT AuditorGeneral's Office as required to assist with and ensure proper examination of matters.

Recommendation 2 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government update this Committee in relation to Australian Government funding negotiations to mental health funding, including the Capital Health Network. Recommendation 3 The Committee recommends that the ACT Legislative Assembly consider reexamining this matter when funding and research outcomes are made public in order to determine the most appropriate way to further develop early intervention measures, education approaches and access to service for suicide prevention activities in the ACT. Action Recommendation 1 - Agreed The ACT Government will update the Legislative Assembly on progress made to improve the collection of ACT data, including receiving consistent data from community based 139 Reporting Entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing, Community and Social Services organisations. The ACT Government submission to the Standing Committee in April 2016 reported that work is underway at a national level to develop a national child death and injury database. The ACT Government notes that work to develop this national database is not being progressed at this time. The Australian Government response to the Contributing Lives, Thriving Communities Review of Mental Health Programmes and Services (Australian Government Response) highlighted the role that primary health networks will have in commissioning suicide prevention services at the regional level. Given the Commonwealth's shift towards outcomes focussed measurement, ACT Health expects that nationally consistent data or a specific key performance indicator will inevitably be required to successfully monitor and evaluate suicide prevention outcomes at the regional level. Should this be the case, ACT Health looks forward to discussions with Capital Health Network on this issue, particularly in the context of joint service planning within the mental health and suicide prevention setting. Recommendation 2 - Agreed ACT Health will provide the Standing Committee with an update on Australian Government mental health funding negotiations where they relate to, or integrate with, joint activity on mental h ealth or suicide prevention between Capital Health Network and ACT Health. ACT Health will also provide Capital Health Network with a copy of the Standing Committee's Report given their specific responsibility for regionalbased primary mental health and suicide prevention commissioning in the ACT region. Australian Government funding negotiations is outside ACT Government's remit and ACT Health is currently only privy to information that is publicly available. The Commonwealth Department of Health or Capital Health Network may be better placed to provide such information either at a national or regional level. Recommendation 3 - Noted The ACT Government notes this recommendation and will await future advice from the ACT Legislative Assembly. The Capital Health Network has undertaken a preliminary regional needs analysis for the ACT and is required to produce a comprehensive mental health and suicide prevention needs assessment in March 2017, followed by a regional mental health and suicide prevention plan. This plan will aim to support a broader regional model of stepped care, support the process of integration with state services, make optimal use of available workforce and resources, and help to target investment by primary health networks in mental health and suicide prevention activity. ACT Health is c ontributing to this activity and is liaising with the Capital Health Network on strategic opportunities in mental health and suicide prevention policy going forward. The Education and Training Directorate has an important role to play in the prevention and intervention of suicide in young people. ACT Health will work with the Education and Training Directorate and the Capital Health Network to operationalise support for young people in schools when the changes to funding models and approaches to prevention initiatives and services are finalised. Additional information ACT public schools are committed to providing positive and engaging environments where children and young people feel connected, respected, achieve success and are fully engaged in education. Schools are committed to developing and maintaining safe schools through a wholeschool and evidence based approach to building the social and emotional skills to build self awareness, self management, social awareness and social management capabilities of students that in turn support their ability to develop and maintain relationships and enhance resilience. These elements are strong protective factors against suicide. 139 138 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Reporting Entity ACT AuditorGeneral's Office The funding model will be used across both ACT public hospitals.

Recommendation 2 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government report to the ACT Legislative Assembly b y the last sitting day in August 2017, on the progress of its implementation of the recommendations made in AuditorGeneral's Report No. 1 of 2016: Calvary Public Hospital Financial and Performance Reporting, that have been accepted either inwhole or inpart. This should include: (i) a summary of action to date, either completed or in progress (including milestones completed); and (ii) the proposed action (including timetable), for implementing recommendations (or parts thereof), where action has not yet commenced. Recommendation 3 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government take appropriate steps to improve its contract management capability of all government contracts it enters into on behalf of the Territory. This should include: (i) clear allocation of contract management roles within acquiring entities; and (ii) adequately resourcing, relative to the size of each contract, the respective contract management functions within each acquiring entity to effectively manage the contract(s). Recommendation 4 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government take appropriate steps to ensure that all contract acquiring entities within ACT Government monitor contractor performance in accordance with contract provisions, and where applicable, take appropriate steps to act on contractor underperformance. 141 Reporting Entity Standing Committee on Public Accounts Recommendation 5 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government take appropriate steps, as part of specific contract provisions, to require contracting entities delivering services on behalf of the Territory to ensure, relative to the size of each contract, that: (i) public interest disclosure policies and procedures are developed, implemented and appropriate steps taken to monitor compliance; and (ii) an employee code of conduct is developed, promoted and appropriate steps are taken to monitor compliance. ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17142 142 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Reporting Entity Standing Committee on Public Accounts Action Recommendation 1 Agreed This document provides the Government Response to the AuditorGeneral's Report and was tabled in line with ACT Legislative Practice in the first sitting week of August 2016. Recommendation 2 Not Agreed It is not appropriate for a Government to bind a future Government to actions. While a future ACT Labor Government would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate progress against the AuditorGeneral's recommendations, the next Legislative Assembly should determine whether it requires this information in the terms recommended by the current Standing Committee on Public Accounts. Recommendation 3 - Agreed in part The Government accepts the recommendation in terms of the contractual relationship between the ACT and Calvary Public Hospital. The AuditorGeneral's Report specifically focussed on issues with contract management in terms of the agreement between the ACT and Calvary for the provision of public hospital services. In terms of the total funding provided over time, the agreement between the ACT and Calvary for public hospital services is the largest contract for services managed by the ACT Government. Further, there is considerable evidence of effective contract management across many ACT Government services. In relation to the findings in the Auditor General's Report, ACT Health is undertaking a contracting review which may include consolidation of major contract management functions within a single area that will provide for greater oversight of the agreement with Calvary and ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to the management of the contract with Calvary. A wider application of Government regulations as noted above would require considerable consultation with business and community groups, with a timeframe that is not possible within the current term of the Legislative Assembly. Recommendation 4 - Agreed in Part As noted above, the Government agrees with the recommendation in relation to the agreement between the ACT and Calvary for the provision of public hospital services. The AuditorGeneral noted in findings that the full provisions of the Calvary Network Agreement were not implemented to maximise the protection of the Territory. While the Territory was not financially at risk in relation to the issue that resulted in the Auditor General's Report, the Auditor General noted provisions within the agreement with Calvary that were not being used, particularly in relation to more robust funding and performance measurement provisions. ACT Health is working with Calvary to establish new, consolidated governance processes. In addition, ACT Health is establishing a contract management and risk plan for the Agreement with Calvary to place the arrangement on a more robust and transparent footing. This work will be completed during 2016-17. This will build on the decisions made over recent years to establish a contract management role for Calvary within ACT Health. Recommendation 5 Agreed in Part As noted in the response to Recommendation Three, the Government supports this recommendation in relation to the agreement with Calvary Public Hospital. Calvary public hospital employees are employed under the same provisions as ACT public servants and it is appropriate to ensure that employees of Calvary have access to safeguards in relation to the reporting of inappropriate behaviours. 143 Reporting Entity Standing Committee on Public Accounts Status Complete INQUIRY INTO THE APPROPRIATION BILL 2016-17 AND APPROPRIATION (OFFICE OF TH E LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY) BILL 2016-17 Reporting Entity Select Committee on Budget Estimates 2016-17 Report Number 1 Report Title Inquiry into the Appropriation Bill 2016-17 and Appropriation (Office of the Legislative Assembly) Bill 2016-17 Link to report http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/913883/Govt Response toEstimates 201617tabled9August2016.pdf Government Response Title Government Response to the Report of the Select Committee on Estimates 2016-2017 on the Inquiry into the Appropriation Bill 2016-17 and Appropriation (Office of the Legislative Assembly) Bill 2016-17 Date Tabled 4 August 2016 Recommendation Number and Summary of Recommendation Recommendation 22 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government continue to lobby the Federal Government for increased funding to headspace ACT.

An implementation plan is currently being developed to detail the critical steps towards the operationalisation of the priorities. Priorities described within the ACT Statement of Priorities align the ACT budget initiative, 'Expanding access to sexual health and blood borne virus services'. This dedicated budget will support the ACT in working towards identified priorities and the National targets for sexual health and blood borne viruses. Projects within the budget initiative will aim to expand HBV, HCV, HIV and sexually transmissible infection (STI) vaccination, testing and treatment services, with a particular emphasis on outreach to vulnerable populations. Education and prevention will be cornerstones of the proposed activities, and programs will help address complex sexual health issues experienced within the ACT community. In addition, the Communicable Disease Control Section (CDC) of the Health Protection Service monitors the incidence of STIs, including HIV and Chlamydia. CDC provides data on STIs to the ACT Ministerial Advisory Council on Sexual Health, HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis and Related Diseases (SHAHRD) and works with the Canberra Sexual Health Centre and ACT General Practitioners in relation to the follow up of notified cases and contacts of STIs in line with recommended contact tracing guidelines.

An implementation plan is currently being developed to detail the critical steps towards the operationalisation of the priorities. Priorities described within the ACT Statement of Priorities align the ACT budget initiative, 'Expanding access to sexual health and blood borne virus services'. This dedicated budget will support the ACT in working towards identified priorities and the National targets for sexual health and blood borne viruses. Projects within the budget initiative will aim to expand HBV, HCV, HIV and sexually transmissible infection (STI) vaccination, testing and treatment services, with a particular emphasis on outreach to vulnerable populations. Education and prevention will be cornerstones of the proposed activities, and programs will help address complex sexual health issues experienced within the ACT community. In addition, the Communicable Disease Control Sectio n (CDC) of the Health Protection Service monitors the incidence of STIs, including HIV and Chlamydia. CDC provides data on STIs to the ACT Ministerial Advisory Council on Sexual Health, HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis and Related Diseases (SHAHRD) and works with the Canberra Sexual Health Centre and ACT General Practitioners in relation to the follow up of notified cases and contacts of STIs in line with recommended contact tracing guidelines.

The People and Culture Branch is responsible for Directorate wide and/or strategic human resource issues, such as providing: general clinical and leadership training enterprise bargaining negotiations highlevel workforce planning Directorate wide people policies. Business units are responsible for deciding their workforce composition below executive level. They make their own recruitment decisions and undertake daytoday management duties. People and Culture work closely with business units to support and respond to their human resource needs and functions and provide advice and assistance, especially in complex or difficult situations such as when: allegations of misconduct have been made team interventions are required to address specific workplace culture issues advice on public sector employment obligations is needed it is difficult to recruit staff with specialised skill sets and/or qualifications. ACT Health is committed to building a collaborative, capable, flexible and innovative workforce to deliver positive, personcentred healthcare outcomes now and into the future by investing in and valuing our people. HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT The ACT Health workforce is the core for delivering quality health services across the ACT and surroundi ng region. The organisation recognises the delivery of established, new and enhanced health services requires a parallel focus on the people who will be delivering these services. Health care is now being delivered in a changed environment, reflecting the shift to community based services and a focus on recovery and consumer oriented services. The dynamic and evolving health environment, coupled with current social trends means that health service delivery will continue to change into the future. ACT Health clinical areas routinely review their Models of Care (MoCs) to validate national and international best practice. ACT Health is an active participant in national health workforce committees, including the: Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Advisory Council (AHWMC) Health Workforce Principle Committee (HWPC). It is essential that ACT Health has the ability to attract and retain a workforce that will enable it to meet the current and future health care needs of the ACT and surrounding community. This issue has been a significant priority over the past year as evidenced by the first tranche of reform, which was undertaken during 2016-17. A major challenge facing ACT Health is recruiting and retaining the right people in a competitive labour market. 159 158 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 FIGURE 7: INCIDENT RATE OF CLAIMS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS RESULTING IN FIVE DAYS OFF WORK TABLE 20: INCIDENT RATE OF CLAIMS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS RESULTING IN FIVE DAYS OFF WORK Year Health Directorate # new 5 day MSD claims Health Directorate MSD rate per 1,000 employees Health Directorate Target 2 ACTPS # new 5 day MSD claims ACTPS MSD rate per 1,000 employees ACTPS Baseline Baseline (Avg FY 09 12)2012 13 2013 14 2014 - 15 2015 - 16 2016 - 17 2017 - 18 2018 - 19 2019 - 20 2020 - 21 2021 22New 5 day claims per 1000 employees HD MSD rate per 1000 employees ACTPS MSD rate per 1000 employees HD Target 2 ACTPS Target 2 159 B.8 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT INTRODUCTION / OVERVIEW ACT Health has a dispersed model for human resources management with many areas sharing responsibility for staffrelated issues.

A major challenge facing ACT Health is recruiting and retaining the right people in a competitive labour market. ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17160 160 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 WORKFORCE PLANNING The ACT Health workforce is the core for delivering quality health services across the ACT and surrounding region. ACT Health recognises that the delivery of new and enhanced health services requires a parallel focus on the people who will be delivering these services. The principal recurrent cost for ACT Health is its employees. The organisation has undertaken workforce planning activities, including gap analysis and trending data. This information has informed the development of a workforce plan that delivers robust and targeted strategies to meet the workforce requirements now and into the future. The regular review of the workforce plan identified an increase in collaborative efforts to meet the plan's strategic deliverables. During 2016-17, ACT Health continued to build its workforce planning capability, including: current and future capability gaps the roles that will be critical for future workforce needs. In addition to this, the Directorate undertook other key workforce planning activities, including: incorporating targeted resourcing discussions with Senior Managers partnering with educational facilities to continue the Directorate's 'grow your own' program which has increased the number of ACT medical and nursing graduates in our workforce undertaking targeted recruitment, which has resulted in a number of successful outcomes, through advertising in profession specific areas, such as: healthcare professional publications and journals healthcarespecific electronic job boards, social media sites and databases promoting ACT Health as an employer of choice at healthcare conferences and seminars participating in career expos. The Directorate continues to align its workforce planning with its business strategy to meet current requirements and plan for the future. Workforce data is analysed to gain an understanding of our workforce profile, trends and future requirements. To optimise work roles, capabilities and mix of skills, ACT Health has undertaken a review of WorkLevel Standards across craft groups to ensure relevance and suitability for the workforce. Interdisciplinary teams are being introduced across the care continuum in ACT Health to: enhance the commitment to, and focus on, patientcentred care prevent assessment and workload duplication. These multidisciplinary teams include staff from medical nursing and allied health disciplines who share a common patient population and patient care goals. A SKILLED AND SUSTAINABLE WORKFORCE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ACT HEALTH IN DELIVERING HEALTH CARE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE ACT AND SURROUNDING AREAS. 161 RETENTION STRATEGIES ACT Health's retention strategies focus on, and specifically address, performance, communication and loyalty. This approach is considered to be an advantage in retaining positive and motivated employees, which is vital to the success of service delivery. How retention strategies are implemented is important as this helps create a positive work environment and strengthens employees' commitment to remaining with ACT Health. This begins during the recruitment phase by providing prospective employees with a realistic view of the working environment, job expectations and advancement opportunities. The Directorate's separation rate for ongoing employees in 2016-17 was 7.6 per cent. This includes all separations for ongoing staff, including terminations, redundancies, resignations and retirements. It does not include ongoing staff moving to other Directorates. ACT Health has developed a number of retention strategies to provide effective methods of reducing employee turnover and attrition and ensuring employees are engaged and productive, including: ongoing professional development career pathways for promotion and career development flexible working arrangements in the relevant Enterprise Bargaining Agreements. The ACT Health Workforce Plan 2013-18 includes a number of initiatives aimed at improving retention. ACT Health will monitor the retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives. WORKPLACE CULTURE Workplace culture and staff en gagement continue to be an area of priority for ACT Health given the strong correlation between retention, staff engagement and overall performance. Following the release of the results of the 2015 (November) Workplace Culture Survey in late February 2016, a number of activities have been undertaken, including: developing and publishing Divisional Workplace Culture Action Plans implementing the Divisional Workplace Culture Action Plans quarterly reporting of progress against Divisional Workplace Culture Action Plans to the ACT Health's DirectorGeneral undertaking pulse surveys to diagnose workplace culture and assess culture improvement initiatives in a number of Divisions supporting two work units whose culture survey results indicated that procuring external assistance was particularly challenging. In addition, interviews were conducted with managers of 11 teams whose culture had significantly improved between the 2012 and 2015 surveys. As a result of these interviews, the top ten practices for improving culture were identified and are now being used to support improvement in other teams. In 2016-17, the Organisational Development Unit provided targeted assistance to 45 teams across the organisation. This included: analysing workplace culture issues developing strategies to address issues that recognised the unique factors of each team. 161 160 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 WORKFORCE PLANNING The ACT Health workforce is the core for delivering quality health services across the ACT and surrounding region.

The range of professions participating in interventions included: medical and nursing staff administrative staff support and infrastructure staff. Evaluations undertaken after the strategies were implemented identified positive improvements. ACT Health continues to embed the ACT Public Service (ACTPS) Respect, Equity and Diversity (RED) Framework across the organisation using an established and active RED contact officer network. The number of RED contact officers as at 30 June 2017 was 103, with 18 new staff trained as RED officers during 2016-17. RED contact officers come from various work groups, including: medical and nursing staff allied health professionals administrative staff staff who work outside traditional business hours. The RED contact officers' network meets quarterly to provide support and professional development on topics such as: raising awareness and tolerance for people who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) discussing ACT Health's Multicultural and Diversity Policy Inclusion (Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) and LGBTIQ) raising awareness and strategies to manage unconscious biases. The Clinical Culture Committee (CCC) meets regularly to progress the seven key recommendations of the ACT Health Review of the Clinical Trai ning Culture, which was undertaken in 2015. The CCC is chaired by ACT Health's DirectorGeneral and membership includes key senior clinicians and senior executives from Canberra Hospital. In 2016-17, the CCC undertook a number of actions to address and progress the seven key recommendations, including: Analysis of the 2015 ACT Health Workplace Culture Survey for medical staff continued, which included followup discussions with medical staff executives. The CCC is considering pulse surveys in 2017 to track progress. In addition, a review of the performance management arrangements for medical staff began, including performance planning and feedback processes. Drafting of the Statement of Desired Culture started using information and data from focus groups held in: July-August 2016 (attended by 153 doctors) September-November 2016 (attended by 474 staff from across ACT Health).

The program addresses the identified leadership capability gaps of clinical leaders (specifically nurses and doctors) working within the critical care environment. This program comprises six twohour modules delivered over the clinical handover period. The content is evidence based, referencing current and contemporary leadership research, with practical activities to help transfer learning to the workplace. The Senior Doctor Leadership Program is discussed in Workplace culture, page 162. The Leading Teams through Change Program was developed to increase leaders' understanding of the psychological and emotional issues staff may experience while going through periods of extensive change. This program is targeted to specific work areas that are experiencing significant change and equips leaders with strategies to support their staff through that change. In 2016-17, a number of senior leaders participated in the Human Synergistics Life Style Inventory (LSI) 360 degree feedback. The LSI tool identifies key leadership styles, strengths and shortfalls.

ACT Health continues to embed the ACTPS Respect, Equity and Diversity Framework across the organisation through a number of training programs. For example, the Respect@Work training program provides staff with information on managing and preventing bullying, harassment and discrimination. 165 The Preliminary Assessment for Managers Program provides managers with information on how to deal with allegations of inappropriate behaviour, including: breaches of conduct bullying harassment discrimination. More specifically, this program assists managers by providing them with: accurate information for how to conduct a preliminary assessment in accordance with the relevant Enterprise Agreements case studies and role plays to practice skills for having difficult conversations. The Keep Calm and Have a Crucial Conversation workshop teaches participants the 'Crucial Conversation tool'. This provides participants with advice for preparing for a difficult conversation and strategies for staying calm and focused on achieving a positive result. The Third Space workshop is based on Dr Adam Fraser's model for improving behavioural flexibility and managing negative interactions with others. The workshop provides strategies for altering mindsets, which affect moods and behaviours so that interactions are positive and professional. The Hermann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) is a neurosciencebased psychometric assessment that rates an individual's thinking agility, cognitive diversity and behaviour preferences. It is currently embedded in the PMP and has resulted in Managers requesting team awareness sessions. The aim of these sessions is to improve the team dynamics, by teaching individuals to recognise their com munication and problem solving preferences and how they best interact with others.

LEARNING AND DEVE LOPMENT PROGRAMS ACT Health implements governance strategies to ensure education and training provides the workforce with the skills and knowledge required to fulfil their roles and responsibilities. Educational programs are based on the annual learning needs analysis and identified organisational requirements. To support this: a Learning and Development Framework provides guidance on creating a learning organisation by integrating strategies into business practices a Standard Operating Procedure guides the design, development and approval of training programs. Key Achievements 2016-17 The learning management system, Capabiliti, was upgraded to improve mandatory and recommended education management. The project was initiated to ensure that staff education meets the capability requirements of job roles, which will ensure the quality and safety of service delivery. System enhancements included: allowing more detailed training requirements to be allocated to groups of staff at an organisational, divisional or work area level using multiple parameters allowing managers to create team or individualised learning plans for their staff allowing staff and managers to easily monitor parti cipation compliance and progress providing a new look and feel, with easier navigation, faster search features and more selfserve options for updating personal details. ACT Health is a Registered Training Organisation (RTO). This provides a quality framework for delivering training in line with the Standards for RTOs 2015. During 2016-17, ACT Health achieved reregistration as an RTO until 2024. This will allow us to continue to provide nationally recognised training and maintain an ongoing commitment to national quality standards for education delivery. A tracheostomy education project was initiated to: improve the safety and management of patients with tracheostomies provide a consistent approach to education. A review of reported incidents and workplace practice by the Tracheostomy Assessment and Consultation Service (TRACS) identified that there was lack of consistent knowledge and training across clinical areas and no formal skills assessment. The project involved updating a selfdirected learning package and creating a formal skills assessment process in consultation with TRACS. The revised education and assessment package is currently being trialled in four wards. Work has also commenced on an elearning program 171 consisting of multidisciplinary modules for nurses, physiotherapists, doctors and speech pathologists. The first modules are planned for release in early 2018. Leadership and management programs ACT Health sponsored four places in the Public Sector Management Program (PSMP), which is delivered by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). It is aimed at emerging public sector midlevel managers. The PSMP provides an engaging and relevant curriculum, delivered using: workbased learning workshops a virtual learning environment.

The Leading Change Program, which will support leaders during ACT Health's current and future change initiatives. 183 Learning and development programs aligned with ACT Health's Quality Strategy, which are designed to further embed quality improvement principles and patientcentred care across the organisation. A comprehensive assessment of educational needs will be conducted, including a review of the Essential Education Policy and Guideline to include training definitions to meet professional, legislative and accreditation requirements. Learning requirements will be further refined in consultation with divisions and work areas, to allocate training on the learning management system by position, classification, branch, sub section and section. A revised model delivering of Child Protection Training will be developed and implemented. The model will comprise two levels: a child protection foundation elearning package for all staff, to be completed every three years an additional halfday face toface session for staff and managers who work directly with: children and young people or adults with reduced parenting capacity who have children in their care. This has been developed in parallel with the development of a new online Child of Concern Report through 'Riskman'. It is anticipated that both initiatives will be launched simultaneously. In addition, an elearning for managers on the Reportable Conduct Scheme will be developed.

FUTURE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT KEY PRIORITIES A project has been established within People and Culture to develop and implement a Performance Excellence Framework. This framework will be tailored to meet the needs of the diverse workforce across ACT Health, to strengthen performance and accountability within the organisation. One of the project's key deliverables is to develop and implement a perform ance plan process in Capabiliti, the learning management system. The system will: provide customised performance plans, including key criteria for health professionals with links to clinical quality, safety and risk improve access for both managers and staff by simplifying completion and approval of performance plans enhance communication by incorporating online records and notes of meetings related to the performance plan process strengthen accountability by providing valid and reliable reporting for the number of plans in place and performance plan histories. The performance system is due to be released in August 2017. Leadership and management development will continue to be a key priority for ACT Health, with a number of programs currently being considered. These include: Financial Management Training through elearning modules, which was initially developed in 2016-17. During 2017-18, further education for staff with budgetary responsibilities will be provided to assist them transition to Activity Based Funding. The Leading Change Program, which will support leaders during ACT Health's current and future change initiatives. 183 Learning and development programs aligned with ACT Health's Quality Strategy, which are designed to further embed quality improvement principles and patientcentred care across the organisation. A comprehensive assessment of educational needs will be conducted, including a review of the Essential Education Policy and Guideline to include training definitions to meet professional, legislative and accreditation requirements. Learning requirements will be further refined in consultation with divisions and work areas, to allocate training on the learning management system by position, classification, branch, sub section and section. A revised model delivering of Child Protection Training will be developed and implemented.

These updates are incorporated into the Commissioner's annual report . In 2016-17, the Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment did not investigate any activities carried out by ACT Health. ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAI NABLE DEVELOPMENT To achieve the ACT Government's target of zero net emissions by 2020, ACT Health actively: participates in the wholeofgovernment ecologically sustainable development initiatives continues to work towards embedding sustainability initiatives into service delivery. In addition, ACT Health works closely with the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate (EPSDD) on sustainability activities and initiatives. During 2016-17, ACT Health developed and/or relied on the following internal documents to guide its emission reduction priorities: ACT Health Sustainability Strategy 2016-2020 (the Strategy) ACT Health Resource Management Plan 2016-2020 (RMP) ACT Health Sustainability Environmental Principles and Guidelines Building and Infrastructure Projects 20152020 (SEPGBIP). ACT Health also relies on wholeofgovernment documentation to: provide guidance on the Digital Health Environment, Sustainable Transport and Sustainable Procurement strategy integrate the principles and practices in the associated documentation into its decisionmaking processes. The Strategy contains a roadmap that effectively i dentifies the attributes required to build an environmentally sustainable directorate. The RMP sets a reportable obligation for ACT Health to demonstrate its commitment to environmental sustainability to the wider ACT Public Service (ACTPS) and the Canberra community. It provides an exciting opportunity for ACT Health to demonstrate what can be achieved in terms of sustainability. ACT Health provides data on a quarterly basis to EPSDD, which is then rolled up into a whole of government report that monitors how the government is holistically performing against the projected target of zero net emissions by 2020. ACT Health used the ACT Health SEPGBIP document to inform new building developments and building refurbishments. ACT Health policies, programs and plans assist to promote Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD), by including economic, social and environmental considerations in decisionmaking processes, as mandated by the Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act 2010 and the Environment Protection Act 1997 . 189 ACT Health actively participates in the ACT Government Carbon Neutral Government Implementation Committee and Buildings and Infrastructure Subcommittee. In 2016-17, ACT Health continued to utilise the $3.3 million loan from the Carbon Neutral Government Fund (CNGF) to: finalise the installation of a 500kw solar photovoltaic (PV) array on the roof of the southern, multi storey car park (Building 26), which is now fully operational and producing electricity into ring main at Canberra Hospital continue upgrading Light emitting Diode (LED) lighting across Canberra Hospital. On completion, this project will actualise energy savings for ACT Health's largest energy consumption site. ACT Health also provided a supported framework for staff to set up Green Teams. ACT Health is required to establish Green Teams to progress the actions contained in the ACT Government Carbon Neutrality Framework with a key objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, Facilities Management, a unit of the Health Infrastructure Services Branch, has listed sustainability as a topic for discussion during toolbox meetings. The aim is to encourage maintenance staff to think more sustainably and provide input into strategies that will lead to positive environmental outcomes. Energy ACT Health continues to utilise the wholeofgovernment Enterprise Sustainability Platform ( ESP) Envizi database to capture data for analysis and reporting purposes and to inform operational management of trends and potential energy usage reduction strategies. In October 2016, the installation of a 500kw solar PV array on the roof of the multistorey car park at Canberra Hospital became operational. The second part of the CNGF project, which is the ongoing upgrading of LED lighting to Canberra Hospital buildings, will continue into the 2017-18 financial year. Initiatives incorporated into the various ACT Health new building projects, upgrades and improvements, aimed at reducing carbon emissions include: installing energy efficient lighting, including emergency lighting installing motion sensors for lighting in office areas trialling energy efficient window glazing, including double glazing in some areas installing intelligent networked lighting controls, such as the Dali lighting system, to enable ongoing lighting efficiencies considering sustainable procurement principles when purchasing consumables and products used in building maintenance installing energy efficient chillers upgrading the building management system for heating ventilation and air conditioning installing variable speed drive control for ventilation fans and motors converting selected large air handling systems to modulating economy cycle operation using the Building IQ system and building analytical software to b etter manage Property Management and Maintenance utilities analysing Actsmart Enterprise Sustainable Platform data to help identify saving opportunities. 189 188 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 B.9 ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONER FOR SUSTAINABI LITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT ACT Health provides the Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment with updates on progress with the implementation of the Commissioner's recommendations from completed reports and inquiries.

ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17190 190 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Water The nature of the services delivered by ACT Health causes a heavy reliance on water, for both clinical and domestic usage, for example: patient showers theatre operations sterilising surgical equipment. Efficient water initiatives incorporated into the various ACT Health new buildings, upgrades and improvements aimed at reducing water usage include: reusing Reverse Osmosis (RO) water from the renal process in the toilet facilities at identified community health centres installing flow restrictors on a range of plumbing fixtures, for example, showers, hand basins and toilets installing motion sensors where applicable, while considering infection control issues using starrated plumbing fixtures when replacing old, broken or outmoded equipment, where practical replacing heating pipe work and associated works at Canberra Hospital, in accordance with the preventative maintenance schedule continuing restrictions on the use of potable (drinkable) water for outside watering of landscapes at all ACT Health facilities, deactivating all garden sprinklers and decommissioning fountains using Canberra Hospital water meter data to monitor and analyse water usage, identify any anomalies and allow identified issues to be fixed immediately continuing to use tank water for outdoor garden watering and external washing of facilities, buildings and pavements, where tanks are install ed analysing Actsmart Enterprise Sustainable Platform data to help identify saving opportunities. Waste ACT Health recycled numerous types of waste in 2016-17, including: paper cardboard plastics cans and glass batteries organic matter fluorescent light tubes metal. The total amount of waste recycled in 2016-17 increased by an estimated 62.02 per cent when compared to 2015-16. A new contract to provide Domestic and Environmental Services to ACT Health was implemented in February 2017. The contract requires the waste contractor to comply with ACT Health waste policy, plans and strategies, including the Actsmart business recycling program. 191 The contract also requires that the implemented waste management strategy be consistent with the Actsmart accreditation. This accreditation strategy's key objectives include: providing waste training for staff upgrading infrastructure to support waste streaming. During 2016-17, over 90 per cent of contractor staff received waste training. More than 80 waste streaming stations were purchased and are being rolled out. In addition, a project to process organic/food wastes at Canberra Hospital commenced. This project aim to significantly increase the volumes of organic wastes diverted from landfill. The ACT Health Staging and Decanting strategy also incorporates the Actsmart Business Recycling program into the refurbishment of new areas and staff are supported to participate in the training offered to achieve maximum recycling outcomes. Transport ACT Health assesses replacement vehicles for efficiencies, both fuel and greenhouse gas emissions, when vehicle replacement occurs. The ACT Health electric vehicles fleet remains at five. The directorate continues to follow wholeof government direction on how to choose an appropriate vehicle given its intended use, for example, hybrid or electric vehicles. A total of 16 electric vehicle charging stations have been installed at ACT Health buildings across the Canberra region. The ACT Health total fleet is 321 vehicles. ACT H ealth continues to install Electronic Log Books into vehicles. This improves Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) reporting and enhances the data used to improve fleet utilisation. Staff are encouraged to use active travel (walk, bus or bike) for trips of less than four kilometres, instead of using motor vehicles. This year, ACT Health introduced two ebikes for staff to ride between Bowes Street and Canberra Hospital. To encourage staff to use bus services as an alternative mode of transport, ACT Health offers MyWay passes to staff for workrelated bus travel.

Risk Management The Directorate's management has identified the following potential risks that may influence the future financial position of the Directorate: abnormal rates of staff separation; the cost of medical malpractice indemnity; ability to attract and retain health professionals; demands on replacing systems, equipment and infrastructure; and growth in demand for services. ACT Go vernment and the Directorate have responded to these risks in a number of ways, including: implementation of strategies for the retention and recruitment of doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals; strengthening our patient safety and clinical practice review framework; ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17198198 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 establishing the Medical School in cooperation with the Australian National University; enhancement of procurement processes to maximise benefits from contracting; a significant investment in infrastructure replacement and growth; and a significant investment in clinical systems and recording systems. The above risks are monitored regularly throughout the year. Financial Performance The following financial information is based on audited financial statements for 201516 and 201617, and the budget and forward estimates contained in the 201718 Health Directorate Budget Statements.

Comparison to 201516 Net Cost of Services There was a 1.2 per cent decrease in net cost of services or $4.5 million less when compared to the 201516 actual cost of $334.7 million. This decrease in net cost of services was due to higher Own Source revenue ($37.5 million), partially offset by higher expenses ($33.0 million). Total Own Source Revenue increased by $37.5 million mainly due to higher: ACT Government User Charges ($42.7 million) due to $23.1 million indexation for payrises and cost escalation and growth in services for intensive and critical care, emergency department, trauma and stroke services and the Dhulwa Mental Health Unit ; and Other Revenue ($1.7 million) due to recoveries of $1.2 million relating to assets found during the stock take and insurance recoveries of $1.2 million that included the switchboard fire damages claim of $1.1 million, partially offset by lower rebates received from Pharmaceutical companies $0.7 million. The four main increases in expenses are: Employee Expenses ($8.7 million) largely due to Enterprise Agreement payris es of 3 per cent and a 2 per cent increase in staff numbers; Grants and Purchased Services ($7.7 million) due to 2.5 per cent indexation and purchasing additional elective surgery procedures from private providers as a result of the elective surgery program that commenced in February 2016 and continued for the first half of this financial year; 199 establishing the Medical School in cooperation with the Australian National University; enhancement of procurement processes to maximise benefits from contracting; a significant investment in infrastructure replacement and growth; and a significant investment in clinical systems and recording systems.

Comparison to 201516 Actual Expenses Total expenses were $33.0 million or 2.5 per cent higher than the 201516 actual result. The increase was predominantly due to higher: Employee Expenses ($8.7 million) largely due to Enterprise Agreement payrises of 3 per cent and a 2 per cent increase in staff numbers; Grants and Purchased Services ($7.7 million) due to 2.5 per cent indexation and purchasing additional elective surgery procedures from private providers to reduce waiting list; Superannuation ($5.7 million) due to a 3 per cent enterprise agreement pay rise and 2 per cent increase in staff; Other Expenses ($5.7 million) largely due to asset loss recognised for the loss of use v alue of the University of Canberra Public Hospital building premises; Supplies and Services ($2.9 million) - largely due to increased costs for: 201 Total Expenditure Components of Expenditure Figure 2, below, indicates the components of the Directorate's expenses for 201617.

Previously, in Gastroenterology, sedations were administered by nursing staff. Since November 2015 it is a requirement that sedations are administered by a specialist. Two senior specialists converting to VMO's have also contributed to this increase; domestic services, food and utilities ($2.5 million) mainly attributable to price rises in electricity, gas and water and cost of cleaning additional buildings, including Dhulwa Mental Health Unit, Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm and 26 Bowes Place; property and rental expenses ($1.9 million) mainly due to the provision of security to three additional sites in 2017, Dhulwa Mental Health Unit, Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm and Bowes Street; and repairs and maintenance ($1.3m) - ma inly relates to expensing of Repairs and Maintenance component of 'Upgrading and Maintaining ACT Health Assets' which is a new initiative aimed at sustaining ACT Health's assets. The increased expenditure against supplies and services was partially offset by a reduction in: pharmaceuticals ($13.5 million) due to Hepatitis C medicines added to the Commonwealth High Cost Drug reimbursement scheme during the 201516 financial year. There was a spike in demand immediately after the drug was added to the scheme. The demand has now moderated, hence the fall in amounts received for highly specialised drugs; and insurance ($5.0 million) - this mainly relates ACT Insurance Authority (ACTIA) passing on cost savings, including the change in ACTIA's reserving methodology, a 26 per cent decrease in administrative costs and a 50 per cent reduction reinsurance costs; and Depreciation and Amortisation ($2.3 million) due to building projects completed during the year, including the Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm, Dhulwa Mental Health Unit and expanded Emergency Department at the Canberra Hospital campus.

Controlled Recurrent Payments Variances between 'Original Budget' and 'Total Appropriated' The difference between Original Budget and Total Appropriated relates to the transfer of appropriation from capital injection, mainly for University of Canberra Hospital ($5.95m), Health Infrastructure Project Management ($1.842m), Surgical Procedures, International Radiology and Emergency Centre ($1.1m), Walkin Centres and Inner North Community Health Infrastructure ($0.6m), Centenary Hospital for Women ($0.5m) and Northside Hospital Scoping ($0.5m). 221HEALTH DIRECTORATE CONTROLLED APPROPRIATION (CONTINUED ) FOR THE YEARENDED 30JUNE 2017 Hidden words Controlled (Continued) Variances between 'Total Appropriated' and 'Appropriation Drawn' The difference between the Total Appropriated and Appropriation Drawn is mainly due to delays in completion of the programs outlined below, with funds being transferred to 201718 to meet future commitments: The Systems Innovation Program which is a comprehensive reform program to improve efficiency in the delivery of healthcare ($1.9 million); Essential Vaccines Program which delivers the National Immunisation Program vaccines to children and at risk groups ($0.7 million); Health Infrastructure Program which is building and improving health facilities across the ACT ($0.6 million); and Establishing the Dhulwa Mental Health Unit ($0.4 Capital Injections Variances between 'Original Budget' and 'Total Appropriated' The difference between Original Budget and Total Appropriated is the transfer of unspent funds from 2015 16 into 201617 of $14.307m mainly relating to An EHealthy Future ($5.688m), Clinical Services and Inpatient Unit Design and Infrastructure Expansion ($4.293m), Capital Upgrades ($1.837m), the Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm ($0.722m) and Essential Infrastructure and Engineering Works ($0.567m), that has been partially offset by the transfer of capital appropriation to Controlled Recurrent Payments ($ 9.672m) for the recurrent components of capital projects including delivery, feasibility, business case development and planning for election commitments, facilities management and recurrent ICT costs. Variances between 'Total Appropriated' and 'Appropriation Drawn' The difference between the Total Appropriated and Appropriation Drawn for capital injections is a result of timing at the end of the financial year between the last available draw down and receipting of invoices and delays in: construction at the University of Canberra Public Hospital due to wet weather; additional works required for recently constructed buildings during the defect liability period including the Dhulwa Mental Health Unit, Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm that will be completed once the service provider is in place, and works for Emergency Department expansion at the Canberra Hospital; computer software development due to data migration issues, requiring legislation changes and sourcing of compatible suitable hardware; and sourcing of an appropriate property for the new mental health accommodation project.

Property, Plant and Equipment (Continued) Transfers between Categories The June 2017 valuation of land, building and leasehold improvements by Egan National Valuers Pty Ltd reclassified two properties from Level 3 to Level 2 and their corresponding land asset. The two properties are the cancer patient accommodation house located in Duffy and a residential step up and step down mental health property located in Kambah. There have been no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the current and previous reporting period. Valuation Techniques, Inputs and processes Level 2 Valuation Techniques and Inputs Valuation Technique: the valuation technique used to value land and buildings is the market approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar properties and buildings (comparable in location and size). Inputs: Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable land and buildings were considered. Regard was taken of the Crown Lease terms and tenure, the Australian Capital Territory Plan and the National Capital Plan, where applicable, as well as current zoning. Level 3 Valuation Techniques and Significant Unobservable Inputs Valuation Technique: Land where there is no active market or significant restrictions is valued through the market approach. Significant Unobservable Inputs: Selecting land with similar approximate utility. In determining the value of land with similar approximate utility significant adjustment to market based data was required. Valuation Technique: Buildings and Leasehold Improvements were considered specialised assets by the Valuers and measured using the cost approach. Significant Unobservable Inputs: Estimating the cost to a market participant to construct assets of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence. For Buildings, historical cost per square metre of floor area was also used in measuring fair value. For Infrastructure Assets the historical costs per cubic metre was also used in measuring fair value. In determining the value of buildings, leasehold improvements, infrastructure assets and community and heritage assets regard was given to the age and condition of the assets, their estimated replacement cost and current use. This required the use of data internal to Health Directorate. There has been no change to the above valuation techniques during the reporting period. Transfers in and out of a fair value level are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. 245Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2017 Hidden words Note 26.

Capital Works in Progress Capital Works in Progress are assets being constructed over periods of time in excess of the present reporting period. These assets often require extensive installation work or integration with other assets, and contrast with simpler assets that are ready for use when acquired, such as motor vehicles and equipment. Capital Works in Progress are not depreciated as the Directorate is not currently deriving any economic benefits from them. Assets, which are under construction or development in 201617, include hospital buildings, software and plant and equipment. 2017 2016 $'000 $'000 Building Works in Progressa 173 416 129 508 Plant and Equipment Works in Progress 1 Computer Software Works in Progressb 11 318 38 667 Total Capital Works in Progress 184 735 168 175 a)The increase is due to the continuing construction of the University of Canberra Public Hospital, refurbishments and upgrades across ACT Health buildings and improvements to essential infrastructure at the Canberra Hospital campus.

Financial Instruments Details of the significant policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, with respect to each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Directorate does not hold any financial liabilities with floating interest rates, therefore the Directorate is not exposed to movements in interest payable. The Directorate is, however, exposed to movements in interest rates on amounts held in Cash at Bank. Interest rate risk for financial assets is managed by the Directorate by only investing in floating interest rate investments that are low risk. There have been no changes in risk exposure or processes for managing risk since last financial reporting period. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken as it is considered that the Directorate's exposure to this risk is insignificant and would have an insignificant impact on the financial results. Credit Ri sk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Directorate's credit risk is limited to the amount of the financial assets it holds net of any allowance for impairment. The Directorate expects to collect all financial assets that are not past due or impaired. Credit risk is managed by the Directorate for cash at bank by holding bank balances with the ACT Government's banker, Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac). Westpac holds a AA issuer credit rating with Standard and Poors. An AA credit rating is defined as 'very strong capacity to meet financial commitments'. Credit risk is managed by the Directorate for investments by only investing surplus funds with the Territory Banking Account, which has appropriate investment criteria for the external fund manager engaged to manage the Territory's surplus funds. The Directorate's receivables are predominantly from ACT Government, Commonwealth Government and insurance companies for compensable patients. As the Commonwealth Government has a AAA credit rating, it is considered that there is a very low risk of default for those receivables. There has been no change in credit risk exposure since last reporting p eriod. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Directorate will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets. The Directorate's financial obligations relate to the payment of grants and the purchase of supplies and services. Grants are paid on a quarterly basis and purchases of supplies and services are paid within 30 days of receiving the goods or services. The main source of cash to pay these obligations is user charges revenue from the ACT Local Health Network Directorate and Controlled Recurrent Payments (CRP) from the ACT Government which are paid on a fortnightly basis during the reporting period. The Directorate manages its liquidity risk through forecasting appropriation drawdown requirements to enable payment of anticipated obligations. See the maturity analysis provided later in this note for further details of when financial assets and liabilities mature. The Directorate's exposure to liquidity risk is considered insignificant based on experience from prior reporting periods and the current assessment of risk.

Financia l Instruments (Continued) Price Risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether these changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or by factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded into the market. The only price risk the Directorate is exposed to results from its investment in the Cash Enhanced Fund. The Directorate has units in the Cash Enhanced Fund that fluctuate in value. The price fluctuation in the units of the portfolio is caused by movements in the underlying investments of the portfolio. The underlying investments are managed by an external fund manager who invests in a variety of different securities, including bonds issued by the Commonwealth Government, the State Government guaranteed treasury corporations and semigovernment authorities, as well as investment grade corporate issues. The Directorate's exposure to price risk and the management of this risk has not changed since the last reporting period. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken for the pric e risk of the Directorate as it has been determined that the possible impact on profit and loss or total equity from fluctuations in price is immaterial.

Financial Instruments - Territorial Details of the significant policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, with respect to each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 44: Significant Accounting Policies Territorial. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Directorate has all Territorial financial assets and financial liabilities held in noninterest bearing arrangements. This means that the Directorate is not exposed to movements in interest rates, and, as such does not have interest rate risk. Therefore a sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Directorate's credit risk is limited to the amount of the financial assets held less any allowance for impairment losses. The Directorate's Territorial financial assets only consist of Cash and Cash Equivalents. Credit risk to Cash and Cash Equivalents is managed by the Directorate by holding bank balances with the ACT Government's banker, Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac). Westpac holds a AA issuer credit rating with Standard and Poors. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Directorate will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Directorate's only Territorial financial obligation relates to an advance received from the Territory Banking Account where there is no requirement to repay the advance within the next twelve months. The Directorate's exposure to liquidity risk is therefore insignificant. Price Risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, whether these changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or by factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. The Directorate holds no investments on behalf of the Territory that are subject to price risk and as a result, is not considered to have any price risk. Accordingly, a sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken. 279HEALTH DIRECTORATE NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARENDED 30JUNE 2017 Hidden words Note 53.

These generalpurpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with Australian Accounting Standards as required by the FMA. Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: i. Australian Accounting Standards; and ii. ACT Accounting and Disclosure Policies. ACCRUAL ACCOUNTING The financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, which recognises the effects of transactions and events when th ey occur. The financial statements have also been prepared according to the historical cost convention, property, plant and equipment, which were valued at fair value in accordance with the re/valuation policies applicable to the Directorate during the reporting period, where applicable. CURRENCY These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Directorate's functional currency. INDIVIDUAL REPORTING ENTITY The Directorate is an individual reporting entity. CONTROLLED AND TERRITORIAL ITEMS The Directorate produces Controlled and Territorial financial statements. The Controlled financial statements include income, expenses, assets and liabilities over which the Directorate has control. The Territorial financial statements include income, expenses, assets and liabilities that the Directorate administers on behalf of the ACT Government, but does not control. The purpose of the distinction between Controlled and Territorial is to enable an assessment of the Directorate's performance against the decisions it has made in relation to the resources it controls, while maintaining accountability for all resources under its responsibility. 287HEALTH DIRECTORATE FORMS PARTOFNOTE2 OFTHEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS FORTHEYEARENDED 30JUNE 2017 APPENDIX A - BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) CONTROLLED AND TERRITORIAL ITEMS The basis of preparation described applies to both Controlled and Territorial financial statements except where specified otherwise.

The controlled Balance Sheet shows that the Directorate's current liabilities of ($322.7 million) exceed its current assets of ($159.3 million) by $163.4 million. However, this is not considered a liquidity risk as its cash needs are funded through appropriation from the ACT Government on a cashneeds basis. This is consistent with the whole of government cash management regime, which requires excess cash balances to be held centrally rather than within individual agency bank accounts.

Control over appropriated funds is obtained upon the receipt of cash. Effective from 1 July 2016 the term appropriation for the provision of outputs (or Government Payment for Outputs) was replaced with the term Controlled Recurrent Payments to better reflect the nature of this type of appropriation. NOTE 4 - USER CHARGES ACT Government User Charges The Directorate receives funding from the Local Hospital Network Directorate (LHN). The funding received from the LHN is based on the historical costs of the Directorate adjusted for growth in services provided and inflation. Funding from the LHN is recognised as revenue when the Directorate gains control over the funding. Control over LHN funding is obtained on the receipt of cash. Service Revenue Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised when the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting d ate can be measured reliably and the costs of rendering those services can be measured reliably. Inventory Sales Revenue from inventory sales is recognised as revenue when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods has transferred to the buyer, the Directorate retains neither continuing managerial involvement nor effective control over the goods sold and the costs incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Amounts Received for Highly Specialised Drugs Revenue from the supply of highly specialised drugs is recognised as revenue when the drugs have been supplied to the patients. Inpatient Fees For the hospital treatment of chargeable patients, inpatient fees are recognised as revenue when the services have been provided. Revenue related to hospital services provided to the Department of Veterans Affairs patients is recognised when the number of patients and complexities of the treatments provided can be measured reliably and the contract price for such services is agreed with the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Oncosts include annual leave, long service leave, superannuation and other costs that are incurred when employees take annual and long service leave. (See Appendix B - Note 33 Employee Benefits for accrued wages and salaries, and annual and long service leave). NOTE 12 - SUPERANNUATION EXPENSES The Directorate receives funding for superannuation payments as part of the Controlled Recurrent Payments. The Directorate makes fortnightly payments to the Territory Banking Account to extinguish its superannuation liability for employees who are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS). This payment does not include the CSS and PSS productivity component which is paid directly to the Commonwealth Su perannuation Corporation (CSC) by the Directorate. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit superannuation plans meaning that the defined benefits received by employees are based on the employee's years of service and average final salary. Superannuation payments have also been made directly to superannuation funds for those members of the Public Sector who are part of superannuation accumulation schemes. This includes the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Accumulation Plan (PSSAP) and schemes of employee choice.

The allowance for impairment losses is based on objective evidence and a review of overdue balances. The Directorate considers the following is objective evidence of impairment: becoming aware of financial difficulties of debtors; default payments; or debts more than 90 days overdue. The amount of the allowance is recognised in the Operating Statement. The allowance for impairment losses is written off against the allowance account when the Directorate ceases action to collect the debt when the cost to recover debt is more than the debt is worth. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES - ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES The Directorate has made a significant estimate in the calculation of the allowance for impairment losses for receivables in the Territorial Financial Statements. This significant estimate is based on a number of categorisations of receivables.

Impairment Losses and WriteOffs Receivables The allowance for impairment of receivables (see Note 23 Receivables Impairment Loss Receivables). SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - ASSETS ASSETS - CURRENT AND NONCURRENT Assets are classified as current or noncurrent in the Balance Sheet and in the relevant notes. Assets are classified as current where they are expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting date. Assets which do not fall within the current classification are classified as noncurrent. NOTE 22 - CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, cash on hand and cash held in the Territory Banking Account. Cash equivalents are shortterm, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. NOTE 23 - RECEIVABLES ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES Accounts receivable (including trade receivables and other trade receivables) are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, with any adjustments to the carrying amount being recorded in the Operating Statement (see Appendix B Note 19 Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write Offs).

Where property, plant and equipment is acquired at no cost, or minimal cost, cost is its fair value as at the date of acquisition. However, property, plant and equipment acquired at no cost or minimal cost as part of a Restructuring of Administrative Arrangements is measured at the transferor's book value. Where payment for property, plant and equipment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the difference between its cash price equivalent and the total payment is measured as interest over the period of credit. The discount rate used to calculate the cash price equivalent is an asset specific rate. Property, plant and equipment with a minimum value of $5,000 is capitalised. MEASUREMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AFTER INITIAL RECOGNITION Property, plant and equipment is valued using the cost or revaluation model of valuation. Land, buildings and leasehold improvements are measured at fair value. The Directorate measures its plant and equipment at cost. Fair value for land and nonspecialised buildings is measured using the market approach valuation technique and uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or similar assets. Fair value for specialised buildings and leasehold improvements is measured by reference to the cost of replacing the remaining future economic benefits embodied in the asset (i.e. depreciated replacement cost). This is the cost approach valuation technique. Land, buildings and leasehold improvements are revalued every 3 years. However, if at any time management considers that the carrying amount of an asset materially differs from its fair value, then the asset will be revalued regardless of when the last valuation took place. Any accumulated depreciation relating to buildings and leasehold improvements at the date of revaluation is written back against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES - USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The Directorate has made a significant estimate in determining the useful lives of its property, plant and equipment. The estimation of useful lives of property, plant and equipment is based on the historical experience of similar assets and in some cases has been based on valuations provided by Egan National Valuers (ACT). The useful lives are assessed on an annual basis and adjustments are made when necessary. Disclosures concerning assets useful life (see Appendix B Note 14 Depreciation and Amortisation).

Land and buildings have been recorded at the market value of similar properties as determined by an independent valuer. In some circumstances, buildings that are purpose built may in fact realise more or less in the market. Infrastructure assets have been recorded at fair value based on depreciated replacement cost as determined by an independent valuer. The valuation uses significant judgements and estimates to determine fair value, including the appropriate indexation figure and quantum of assets held. The fair value of assets is subject to management assessment between formal valuations. Valuation of NonCurrent Assets Certified practicing registered valuers Egan National Valuers (ACT) performed an independent valuation of the Directorate's Land, Buildings and Leasehold Improvements as at 30 June 2017. Names and qualifications of the valuers are: 1.Carolyn Mowbray - Certified Practising Valuer, Bachelor (Property Studies) 2.Tony Leonard - Certified Practising Valuer, Bachelor of Business (Land Economy) 3.Phillip Mannell - Certified Practising Valuer, Bachelor of Health Administration 4.Ben Driller - Certified Practising Valuer (Victoria) The next valuation will be undertaken during 201920. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS The Directorate assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Assets are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. However, intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested annually for impairment regardless of whether there is an indication of impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate they might be impaired. Any resulting impairment losses for land, buildings and leasehold improvements are recognised as a decrease in the Asset Revaluation Surplus relating to these classes of assets. Where the impairment loss is greater than the balance in the Asset Revaluation Surplus for the relevant class of asset, the difference is expensed in the Operating Statement. Impairment losses for plant and equipment and intangible assets are recognised in the Operating Statement, as plant and equipment and intangibles are carried at cost. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. Nonfina ncial assets that have previously been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date.

HEALTH DIRECTORATE FORMS PARTOFNOTE2 OFTHEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS FORTHEYEARENDED 30JUNE 2017 APPENDIX B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - LIABILITIES (CONTINUED) NOTE 33 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED) The long service leave liability is estimated with reference to the minimum period of qualifying service. For employees with less than the required minimum period of 7 years of qualifying service, the probability that employees will reach the required minimum period has been taken into account in estimating the provision for long service leave and applicable oncosts. The provision for annual leave and long service leave includes estimated oncosts. As these oncosts only become payable if the employee takes annual and long service leave while inservice, the probability that employees will take annual and long service leave while in service has been taken into account in estimating the liability for oncosts. Annual leave and long service leave liabilities are classified as current liabilities in the Balance Sheet where there are no unconditional rights to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months. Conditional long service leave liabilities are classified as noncurrent because the Directorate has an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability until the employee has completed the requisite y ears of service. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Significant judgements have been applied in estimating the liability for employee benefits. The estimated liability for annual and long service leave requires a consideration of the future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, probability that leave will be taken in service and periods of service. The estimate also includes an assessment of the probability that employees will meet the minimum service period required to qualify for long service leave and that oncosts will become payable. The significant judgements and assumptions included in the estimation of annual and long service leave liabilities include an assessment by an actuary. The Australian Government Actuary performed this assessment in May 2014. The assessment by an actuary is performed every 5 years. However, it may be performed more frequently if there is a significant contextual change in the parameters underlying the 2014 report. The next actuarial review is expected to be undertaken by May 2019. NOTE 34 - OTHER LIABILITIES Revenue received in advance is recognised as a liability if there is a present obligation to return the funds received, otherwise all are recorded as revenue.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT YET TO BE APPLIED The following new and revised accounting standards and interpretations have been issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board but do not apply to the current reporting period. These standards and interpretations are applicable to future reporting periods. The Directorate does not intend to adopt these standards and interpretations early. Where applicable, these Australian Accounting Standards will be adopted from their application date. AASB 9 Financial Instruments (December 2014) (application date 1 January 2018); This standard supersedes AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The main impact of AASB 9 is that it will change the classification, measurement and disclosures of the Directorate's financial assets. At this stage the Directorate is not able to estimate the impact of this new standard on its financial statements. The Directorate will make a more detailed assessment of the impact over the next 12 months. AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (application da te 1 January 2018); AASB 15 is the new standard for revenue recognition. It establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces AASB 111 Construction Contracts and AASB 118 Revenue. At this stage the Directorate is not able to estimate the impact of this new standard on its financial statements. The Directorate will make a more detailed assessment of the impact over the next 12 months. AASB 2016 7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Deferral of AASB 15 for notforprofit Entities (application date 1 January 2017, which was the original mandatory effective date of AASB 15); This standard amends the mandatory effective date of AASB 15 for notforprofit entities, so that AASB 15 is required to be applied by these entities for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 instead of 1 January 2018. At this stage the Directorate is not able to estimate the impact of AASB 15 on its financial statements. The Directorate will make a more detailed assessment of the impact over the next 12 months.

PROCUREMENT PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES In 2016-17, ACT Health exercised all procurement activities in accordance with the ACT Government tender thresholds and complied with procurement policies and procedures as stated in the Government Procurement Act 2001 and the Government Procurement Regulation 2007. To ensure compliance with ACT Government procurement legislation, ACT Health: sought advice on government procurement policies and procedures from Procurement and Capital Works (PCW) notified PCW of all procurements over $25,000 undertaken by ACT Health appropriately referred procurements requiring single, restrictive or open tender procurement processes to PCW referred all procurements requiring Government Procurement Board (GPB) consideration and/or approval to PCW. In accordance with procurement legislation, ACT Health afforded the highest standard of probity and ethical behaviour towards prospective tenderers. Such behaviour included equality, impartiality, transparency and fair dealing. A competitive procurement process is conducted wherever possible; however, due to the specialised nature of the industry, ACT Health frequently accesses single select and restricted select procurement methodologies. These procurement methodologies are justified under the following circumstances: The procurement needs to be compatible with existing medical equipment, both hardware and software, within the clinical setting. Clinical units a re seeking to standardise medical equipment with existing equipment. This mitigation strategy reduces the risk of human error in the delivery of clinical practice because equipment is familiar due to established equipment operating procedures. A limited number of providers possess the specialised medical knowledge and/or expertise that can fulfil the ACT Health's requirements. Timing may preclude public tenders being called in situations that could result in disruption to medical services. Single select and/or restricted select procurement processes are completed in accordance with the provisions of the Government Procurement Regulation 2007 and are approved by the DirectorGeneral with a statement of justification, as required by the Government Procurement Act 2001 . Frequently, ACT Health relies on the NSW Department of Commerce Standing Offer Agreements for restricted select procurement. Through open tender, NSW has a selected panel of preferred suppliers/providers from which procurement is made. To use the buying power of the NSW Government, ACT Health frequently asks panel suppliers to offer NSW Department of Commerce pricing on tenders. This strategy: increases the likelihood of better value for money to the Territory in comparison to a standalone open tender creates a more efficient procurement process. 313Hidden word 312 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 OFFICE ACCOMMODATION The agency employs 7,403 staff, of whom 1,196 occupy officestyle accommodation in the sites listed in Table 51.

Issues and challenges Calvary recognises its responsibility to partner with ACT Health in the plural challenges of meeting the growing health needs of the community while achieving greater efficiencies across services. This challenge r equires the collaboration of not only acute care services, but all public and private health service providers in both institutional and community settings to meet the concurrent factors of: longer life expectancy an ageing population improved management of chronic conditions consistent emergence of new and expensive health practices and technology. Calvary welcomes the opportunity to work with ACT Health on the development of a Territorywide clinical services plan, which will provide the basis for a sustainable and highquality health system in the ACT. Future directions Calvary has commenced a project to upgrade its operating theatres and will also increase and improve its medical imaging services in the last quarter of 2017. Calvary will continue to enhance the clinical stream model across acute services. This model, which integrates medical, nursing and allied health services into a single care team, supports: multidisciplinary care plans and treatment improved patients' outcomes reduced length of stay consistent patient flow in Calvary's acute care settings. The standalone Calvary Bruce Private Hospital will open in September 2017. The new private hospital will include a range of clinical and hospitality features to facilitate contemporary clinical services and offer an unparalleled hospitality experience for patien ts. 353 Existing arrangements that allow patients to elect private admission will continue. Procedures and processes are being modified to: ensure the seamless transition between services and take into account the physical separation of the two services. The new private hospital is located next to the Calvary Clinic Medical Professional Suites and Hyson Green Private Mental Health Inpatient and Day Therapy Centre . This creates a comprehensive private health node in Bruce and also enables Calvary Health Care to achieve a significant milestone that was formalised in the Calvary Network Agreement. Calvary will work closely with ACT Health to determine the most urgent and appropriate use of the previously private hospital areas that can be repatriated for public services. 353Hidden word 352 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 Calvary expanded its waste management programs to develop 29 waste management streams, including multiple clinical waste streams, that are 'sorted at source'. This program has been strongly supported by staff and is endorsed by the Calvary group policy on environmental stewardship. In 2016, Calvary's Domestic Services Manager, Greg Robertson, received the Minister's Award for Leadership, and in 2017 Calvary was again named the Biggest Recycler by the ACT Government's Actsmart program.

In 2016-17, 1014 people were apprehended and brought to the Canberra Hospital for assessment. This is a marginal decrease of 1.3 per cent from the previous year. Emergency detentions increased from the previous reporting period by 12.5 per cent. Of the 858 detentions, the 72 hour detention was allowed to lapse or be revoked in 478 cases (56 per cent). ACAT granted 380 applications for extension of up to a further 11 days. These figures are steady for the last two years and are an indication of the treating team's efforts to continue to appropriately stabilise an acute episode of illness. An increased stability of a person's mental health during an inpatient admission provides a greater chance of successful ongoing management for that person in the community. ACAT held 904 hearings during 2016-17 and granted 627 PTOs. This is a significant decrease of 31.3 per cent from 2015-16. This anomaly is due to the changes in the Guardianship and Management of Property Act 1991 as a consequence of the Mental Health Act 2015 , which now allows for Guardians or Health Attorneys to give conse nt for people with a mental illness or mental disorder who do not have decision making capacity but show a willingness to accept treatment. As a result, a significant number of persons with a mental illness who would previously been treated under a PTO now receive treatment under the alternate Act. The percentage of persons whose PTO was revoked was the same as for 2015-16. Twentyfive ECT orders were authorised by ACAT, an increase from 14 from the previous year. No applications were made to ACAT for emergency ECT. Eight crossborder agreements were made between the ACT and interstate facilities. The ACT transferred eight people to facilities in NSW and Queensland. Contraventions of PTOs decreased from 101 to 80 in 2016-17. This is a reduction of 20 per cent from 2015- 16. This figure partly reflects the lower total number of PTOs in operation in the last year. Fortyfive people were brought to the Canberra Hospital for medication or assessment purposes, and 20 were admitted to hospital as a result. Community teams make every effort to anticipate and manage crises early. Often, if this is successful, a contravention is not required. 357 The ACT Magistrates Court made 118 referrals for assessment pursuant to section 309 of the Crimes Act 1900 , a 50 per cent increase from the previous year when 78 referrals were made. Of these 118 referrals, 93 people (79 per cent) required admission to a mental health facility for assessment purposes, with 25 being returned to court on the same day. The Court Assessment Liaison Service continues to provide assessment and advice to the courts at the time of the hearing, which in many circumstances means that a section 309 referral is not required. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the significant contribution of Dr Peter Norrie who retired in December 2016.

This includes documents in the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) Radiation Protection Series, which are available free of charge from www.arpansa.gov.au. National Directory for Radiation Protection The National Directory for Radiation Protection (the Directory) provides the basis for achieving uniformity of radiation protection practices across Australian jurisdictions, and is an incorporated document under the Radiation Protection Act 2006 . The Directory is designed to be regularly updated to reflect the best radiation protection practice of the time. The Directory is prepared by the ARPANSA Radiation Health Committee, and is only updated in accordance with prescribed processes. The Council is regularly briefed on developments with regard to the work of the ARPANSA Radiation Health Committee. ACT Health has a jurisdictional representative appointed to the committee. Approvals and decisions LicencesThe Council issued 204 new licences during the 2016-17 year, bringing the total number of active licences in the ACT to 1,314. Overall, this represents a 9.9 per cent increase (118 licences) on the 2015-16 total of 1,196 licences. Registrations The Council registered 6 2 new radiation sources during the 2016-17 year, bringing the total number of registered radiation sources in the ACT to 684. Overall, this represents a 4 per cent increase (26 sources) on the 2015-16 total of 658 registered sources. Radiation incidents Four radiation incidents, summarised in Table 61, were reported to the Council during the year and underwent further investigation. TABLE 61: RADIATION INCIDENTS Incident type No. incidents Details Accidental Exposure 1 A head CT scan was performed on the wrong patient. This patient was wearing an incorrect ID tag. However, it later transpired that the head CT scan was actually required for that patient. Other Incident 3 One patient experienced a fraction mismatch during radiation therapy, which was detected in posttreatment quality assurance procedures. One patient had a bone scan prescribed and the radiopharmaceutical was administered, but the imaging procedure was not completed. The request for the procedure had been cancelled before the radionuclide was administered but this was not communicated to the relevant staff. Therefore, there was no diagnostic benefit from the radiation exposure. 363 Incident type No. incidents Details The appropriate radiopharmaceutical was administered to a patient who was subsequently unable to complete the Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT imaging procedure due to anxiety caused by pain and claustrophobia. In line with the ACT Health Risk Management Guidelines, all four incidents were deemed insignificant. The areas involved undertook reviews of working systems and, where necessary, amended procedures to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future. Following investigation, all four of these incidents were reported to ARPANSA for inclusion on the Australian Radiation Incident Register. Enforcement and remedial actions by the Council No investigations or legal proceedings were commenced in 2016-2017.

The Directorate receives Activity Based Funding from the Commonwealth and ACT Governments, and block funding for teaching, training and research. It purchases public hospital services from four ACT public hospital providers: Canberra Hospital and Health Services; Calvary Public Hospital; Clare Holland House; and Queen Elizabeth II Family Centre. Risk Management The Directorate's management has identified the following potential risks that may influence the future financial position of the Directorate. If actual performance activity is lower than the budgeted activity for the Directorate for 201718, this would result in lower Commonwealth National Health Reform revenue to the ACT Government. It could also result in lower cross border revenue. For 201718, Commonwealth funding to the ACT is capped at 6.5 per cent growth on 201617 f unding outcome. As such, if activity comes in above this growth rate in 201718, this could result in zero Commonwealth funding to the ACT for activity delivered above 6.5 per cent growth level. The above risks are monitored regularly throughout the year. 365Hidden word 364 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17 ACT LOCAL HOSPITAL NETWORK DIRECTORATE ANNUAL REPORT 2016-17 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FOR THE ACT LOCAL HOSPITAL NETWORK DIRECTORATE, FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017 365Management Discussion and Analysis for the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate, For the Year Ended 30 June 2017 General Overview Purpose The ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate (the Directorate) was established under the Commonwealth's National Health Reform Act 2011 and the ACT's Health (National Health Funding Pool and Administration) Act 2013 (the Acts), and is administered by the DirectorGeneral of the Health Directorate and supported by staff from the Health Directorate.

This was mainly due to higher own source revenue due to higher grants from the Commonwealth and cross border revenue for treating higher patient numbers than estimated in the budget. Comparison to 201516 Actual There was an increase of $22.0 million or 3.6 per cent compared to the 201516 net cost of service of $603.7 million. This was due to higher than expected expenses of $46.0 million mainly relating to growth in acute services including emergency and additional elective surgery, community and primary care services, women and children's health, outpatients and mental health. Higher expenses are partially offset by an increase in own source revenue of $24.0 million mainly due to: growth in activity for public hospital services funded through the National Health Reform Agreement including emergency and additional elective surgery, community and primary care services, women and children's health, outpatients and mental health; and a higher number of interstate patients, in particular New South Wales residents, being treated in ACT public hospitals. 367 Financial Performance The following financial information is based on audited financial statements for 201516 and 201617, and the forward estimates contained in the 201718 ACT Local Health Network Budget Statements.

Financial Instruments Details of the significant policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, with respect to each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 2 (see Appendix B) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Directorate has no exposure to interest rate risk, as its cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables are noninterest bearing. A Sensitivity Analysis has not been undertaken for the interest rate risk as the Directorate is not exposed to movements in interest rates. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Directorate's credit risk is limited to the amount of the financial assets it holds net of provision for impairment. The Directorate's financial assets consist o f cash and cash equivalents and receivables. Cash and cash equivalents are held with the Westpac Banking Corporation, a high credit, quality financial institution, in accordance with whole of ACT Government banking arrangements. The Directorate's receivables mainly consist of amounts owed by New South Wales Health and the Department of Health and Human Services in Victoria. As the New South Wales and Victorian Governments both have a AAA credit rating, it is considered that there is a very low risk of default for these receivables. Any credit risk for receivables with New South Wales Health and the Department of Health and Human Services in Victoria is managed by having an agreement in place to provide required activity data in a timely manner. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Directorate will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The main source of cash to pay these obligations is appropriation from the ACT Government and Grants from the Commonwealth. Appropriations are paid on a fortnightly basis and the Commonwealth Grants on a monthly basis during the year. The Directorate manages its liquidity risk through forecasting Controlled Recurrent P ayments drawdown requirements to cover its financial liabilities when they fall due. The Directorate's exposure to liquidity risk and the management of this risk has not changed since the previous reporting period. Price Risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, whether these changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or by factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. The Directorate holds no financial instruments that are subject to price risk and as a result, is not considered to have any price risk. Accordingly a sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken. 389 388 ACT Health: Annual Report 2016-17ACT LOCAL HOSPITAL NETWORK DIRECTORATE NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARENDED 30JUNE 2017 Hidden words Note 11.

Service Concession Asset The Directorate has entered into an agreement with Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd for the provision of hospital and associated services. The original agreement was entered into by the Commonwealth on 22 October 1971 and does not stipulate an expiry date. This was subsequently amended in 1979 to include the Directorate (named at the time as the Capital Territory Health Commission) with any duties or functions of the Commonwealth being transferred to the Directorate. The Agreement was for the facility to be used for a public hospital. This was varied, in 1988, by the Calvary Private Agreement to allow Calvary Health Care Ltd to use two floors of the facility for treating private patients. The Calvary Private Agreement sets the process and mechanism for Calvary Private to reimburse Calvary Public for any costs incurred in using public hospital facilities for treating private patients. These agreements were replaced on 7 December 2011 with the Calvary Network Agreement. Under the Agreement, Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd is required to provide hospital services and make these services available to all persons irrespective of their circumstances and is to charge patients fees only in accordance with the scale of fees applicable at Health Directorate hospitals for comparable services. In the event that the agreement ceases, all land is to be returned to the Territory. The level of services that are required to be provided in a financial year, for the amount of funding provided, is stipulated in a Performance Plan agreed between the Directorate and Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd for each year. These arrangements have remained unchanged during the reporting period. The Agreement may be terminated by Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd or the Health Directorate if there are material breaches of the Agreement or the Crown Lease is terminated. In the event the Agreement is terminated, the management of the Calvary Public Hospital will transfer to the Health Directorate. The land, hospital buildings and other assets comprising the Calvary Public Hospital are not recognised in the Directorate's Balance Sheet. Service concession arrangement has been accounted for in accordance with the whole of government policy on Public Private Partnerships Financed by the Operator with the Assets being Territory Assets at the end of the Arrangement .
