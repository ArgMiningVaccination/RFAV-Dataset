My experiences with her were excellent. She is a truly caring person who takes the time to listen in order to fully understand the issue that I'm describing. She has a wide breadth of knowledge about all health conditions and I feel comfortable talking to her about anything. I really appreciate that she writes down all her recommendations, and that they range from the least invasive (homeopathy, herbs and products from the health food store) to more intense (acupuncture, or vitamin shots) when needed. I really respect the Naturopathic approach: see if you can heal yourself with diet and lifestyle changes, use herbs and vitamins to tackle harder problems and only use pharmaceuticals when all else fails. - 12/18/2011 I started seeing Dr. Murphy a couple of years ago to address several issues I was having that \"regular\" doctors didn't seem to be able to help me with, including severe fatigue. She offered me a wealth of information, sound advice, and various supplements to boost my body's natural abilities. Following the advice of a naturopath to a tee, however, took more discipline than I could muster, and so I \"half-way\" followed her treatment plan, and halfway let it slide... Then Dr. Murphy moved to L.A. and I stopped seeing her entirely, and the bottles of special tinctures she had made for me collected dust in the medicine cabinet. Several months later, during the summer, I started having some weird hormone-related symptoms. I got my hormone levels and thyroid tested and the numbers came up slightly off, so an endocrinologist prescribed me some medication she said would balance things out. But, after doing some of my own research, I realized that I was wary about fixing a slight imbalance with a pill. So I contacted Dr. Murphy again, and we began phone sessions. This time, I was more motivated to actually follow her instructions word for word. And so, that's what I have been (almost!) doing for the past four months -- specifically, I have been taking my tinctures and adhering to a strict no dairy no soy diet. I am writing this note today to testify that, indeed, natural medicine does work. The fatigue I used to suffer from is GONE. I no longer need to take naps in the car when I arrive at work in the morning. I no longer fall asleep the second I lie down in bed (my ex used to compare me to one of those baby dolls whose eyelids close whenever you lie it flat.) I no longer have that \"can't move\" feeling at 4 pm every day. (Of course, it also helps that my job is way less crazy, but still.) The circles under my eyes are fading. Those of you who knew me in my teens and twenties will be astounded to know that I no longer need to sleep until past noon on the weekends. This morning I was wide awake at 9:30! And, there have been other amazing changes, such as increased sex drive. I haven't had my levels re-tested yet, but I am positive they have normalized because I feel so much better. I hope that anyone who reads this who has suffered from digestive issues, fatigue, or any of other \"sub-clinical\" maladies will consider trying natural medicine. If you are depressed or anxious or sluggish, therapy can help but it may be your thyroid! Or your adrenals! And dietary changes and supplements CAN HELP. A LOT. TRUST ME. I know this note is starting to sound like an advertisement, but I'm okay with that. Dr. Murphy is just so smart and such a good listener. It is so comforting to be able to talk on the phone with, and email, a doctor you really trust. - 4/7/2009Updated review Natural Medicine Works is the best option for natural healing and life maintenance.

Natural Medicine Works can change your life for the better.6/10/2007Previous review The name kind of says it all but what it doesn't say, is that natural medicine works best when you have caring, knowledgeable professionals to guide you through the healing process. Nobody understands that process better or cares more about it than Coleen and Andrew.
