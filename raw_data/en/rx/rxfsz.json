Dead Sea Salts have been used by many different cultures for hundreds of years. They have a number of different beneficial properties which can be used for detoxifying the body. Dead Sea Salts are different than traditional salts in that it is actually a naturally occurring pure mineral compound of magnesium, potassium, calcium chloride, sodium and bromide. These minerals have very powerful health benefits that can enhance the detoxification capabilities of the body. How a Dead Sea salt bath works: Magnesium and the rest of the minerals are readily absorbed through the skin and into the body's blood stream. The skin is a highly porous membrane that both takes in minerals and eliminates toxins every day. Using a powerful mineral base such as Dead Sea salts in a bathwater medium creates a process called reverse osmosis. This process pulls salt and harmful toxins out of the body and allows the magnesium, potassium, calcium chloride, sodium and bromide to enter into the body. Magnesium plays a critical role in over 325 enzymes, helps to improve muscle and nerve function, reduces inflammation and improves blood flow and oxygenation throughout the body. The rest of the minerals are necessary building blocks for healthy joints, skin and nervous tissue. Dead Sea salts replenish the body's magnesium levels and minerals. This combination helps to flush toxins from the body and helps build key protein molecules in the brain tissue and joints. The use of regular Dead Sea baths has been shown to improve the symptoms of many health conditions including athlete's foot, gout, toenail fungus, sprains, bruises and muscle soreness. It is also good for anyone dealing with chronic disease or chronic pain to do regular Dead Sea baths to help detoxify and de-inflame while improving mineral and mineral balance in the body. Contraindications to Dead Sea Salt baths would be if you are pregnant, dehydrated or have open wounds or burns on your skin. Individuals who are suffering with cardiovascular disease should always consult with a natural health physician who is familiar with the health benefits of Dead Sea salt baths before starting. How to take a Dead Sea salt bath: The first step is to schedule yourself at least 40 minutes, as you need about 20 minutes to remove the toxins, and for the second 20 minutes, the body absorbs the minerals in the bath water. Fill up your bath with warm water. Be sure to have a water filtration system in your house, as you don't want to bathe in tap water that has toxic chlorine, fluoride, dioxins and heavy metals. Add in the Dead Sea salts in the following amounts: Children under 60 lbs: Add 1/2 cup of salts to a standard size bath Individuals between 60-100 lbs: Add 1 cup of salts to a standard size bath Individuals between 100-150 lbs: Add 1 1/2 cup of salts to a standard size bath Individuals between 150-200 lbs: Add 2 cups of salts to a standard size bath For every 50lbs larger - add in an additional 1/2 cup of salts. Additional strategies Adding in a 1/2 cup of olive oil is also very good for the skin, as the polyphenols soak into the skin and give extra antioxidant benefits. Adding ginger or cayenne can increase your heat levels, which will help you to sweat out toxins. You can add anywhere from 1 tbsp to 1/2 a cup to stimulate sweating, and these herbs are loaded with antioxidants that will enhance the detoxification process as well. Do not use soap with a Dead Sea salt bath, as it will interfere with the action of the minerals and the detoxification process. Try to rest for an hour or two afterwards unless you have arthritic joints, in which case you will want to stay active as much as possible to prevent congestion in the joints.
