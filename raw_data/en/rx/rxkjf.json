Background The Health Information Technology Policy Committee (HITPC) is a federal advisory committee that advises the U.S. Department of Health and H uman Services (HHS) on federal HIT policy issues, including how to define the meaningful use (MU) of electronic health records (EHRs) for the purposes of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs. The HITECH portion of the American Recovery and Re investment Act (ARRA) of 2009 specifically mandated that incentives should be given to Medicare and Medicaid providers not for EHR adoption but for meaningful use of EHRs. In July of 2010, HHS released that program's final rule, thus defining stage 1 MU and strongly signaling that the bar for what constitutes MU would be raised in subsequent stages in order to improve advanced care processes and health outcomes. The HITPC held six public hearings in 2010 including testimony from several dozen stakeholder s and received additional dozens of public comments via its blog. All of this input helped to inform its many hours of public deliberations regarding the future vision of MU ( e.g., stage 3) as well as the interim stepping stone of stage 2 MU that will set expectations for 2013 and 2014. The HITPC has developed a preliminary set of recommendations specifically designed to solicit additional public feedback. The goal of sending out this request for comment (RFC) early is threefold. 1. Provide some signal to th e industry of potential new EHR functionalities that the HITPC may recommend to help the industry get a head start on developing new functionalities. 2 2. Extend the public discussion of future stage MU definitions through a more formal public comment process w ell in advance of its formal final stage 2 recommendations to be issued in the summer of 2011. 3. Request input on specific questions. Following analysis of the comments received through the approximately 45-day public comment period, the HITPC intends to rev isit these recommendations in its public meetings in the spring of 2011. At that time, the HITPC will be able to review public comments in the context of the early feedback from providers on experience with stage 1 MU. That input will come through many veh icles: the Medicare program , the Medicaid program (both federal and state constituencies) , the HIT regional extension program , and other sources. Note, this RFC solely represents the preliminary thinking of the HITPC and its Meaningful Use Workgroup . II. Solicitation of Comments A. Instructions 1.

Structure and Relevant Concurrent HITPC Activities The HITPC has created a matrix of objectives and measures that it is considering for its recommendations to HHS. These objectives are o rganized into four of the five health outcome priorities that formed the stage 1 MU organizing structure. The HITPC approached its task of developing proposed stage 2 objectives by first developing a longer -term vision for MU and then determining what an appropriate stage 2 stepping stone is to get there. For this reason, the matrix includes possible stage 3 objectives, but they are only included in the matrix in order to provide context for the Stage 2 recommendations. Therefore, for the purpose of this Re quest for Comments, the HITPC is primarily interested in comments on the proposed Stage 2 objectives at this time . The HITPC has a concurrent activity that is developing Stage 2 and 3 recommendations for the fifth health outcome priority \u2014 ensure adequate privacy and security protections for personal health information. The HITPC and its Privacy & Security Tiger Team will subsequently release recommendations for this domain. In addition, the HITPC has a Quality Measures (QM) Workgroup that is concurrently developing a framework for the evolution of clinical quality measures to be electronically reported as part of Stages 2 and 3 MU. The HITPC recently collected public input through a request for comment on a set of proposed measure concepts, and it will pro vide more guidance on its measure development priorities in the near future following synthesis and analysis of those 5 public comments. Other recommendations about information exchange are being developed by the HITPC's Information Exchange Workgroup. C.

Additional Specific Questions for Public Comment The Health Information Technology Policy Committee welcomes public comment on all proposed objectives and their associated definitions. In addition, the Committee seeks specific input on the following additional questions. 1. How can electronic progress notes be defined in order to have adequate specificity? 2. For patient/family access to personal health information, w hat standards should exist regarding ac cessibility for people with disabilities (e.g., interoperability with assistive technologies to support those with hearing, visual, speech, or mobile impairments)? 3. What strategies should be used to ensure that barriers to patient access - whether secondary to limited internet access, low health literacy and/or disability - are appropriately addressed? 4. What are providers' and hospitals' experiences with incorporating patient -reported data (e.g., data self -entered into PHRs, electronically collected patient s urvey data, home monitoring of biometric data, patient suggestions of corrections to errors in the record) into EHRs? 5. For future stages of meaningful use assessment, should CMS provide an alternative way to achieve meaningful use based on demonstration of high performance on clinical quality measures (e.g., can either satisfy utilization measures for recording consideration via the HIT Policy Committee's Privacy & Security Tiger Team 15 allergies, conducting CPOE, drug -drug interaction checking, etc, or demonstrate low rates of adverse drug events) ? 6. Should Stage 2 allow for a group reporting option to allow group practices to demonstrate meaningful use at the group level for all EPs in that group? 7. In stage 1, as an optional menu objective, the presence of an advance directive should be recorded for over 50% of patients 65 yea rs of ag e or older. We propose making this objective required and to include the results of the advance -directive discussion, if available. We invite public comment on this proposal, or to offer suggestions for alternative criteria in this area. 8. What are the rea sonable elements that should make up a care plan, clinical summary, and discharge summary? 9. What additional meaningful -use criteria could be applied to stimulate robust information exchange ? 10. There are some new objectives being considered for stage 3 where t here is no precursor objective being proposed for stage 2 in the current matrix. We invite suggestions on appropriate stage 2 objectives that would be meaningful stepping - stone criteria for the new stage 3 objectives. E. Evidence Base/Rationale for Proposed New Objectives The HITPC identified proposed new objectives because of their potential impact on the five health outcome priorities to be achieved through the meaningful use of EHRs. Some of the relevant evidence to these proposed objectives is reflected b elow. Patient and Family Engagement 16 In a randomized control trial assessing the efficacy of a home -based computer system in providing information and decision support as well as expert and other patient contacts to patients with HIV, findings were signi ficant for improved quality of life indicators such as cognitive function, social support and participation in their health care, and also for decreased time spent during ambulatory visits, fewer phone calls to providers, and decreased number and length of hospitalizations.iv Qualitative data analysis of provider impressions of a patient centered CDSS (Patient Assessment, Care and Education) designed to increase identification and treatment of chemotherapy related symptoms affirmed the increased awareness o f underreported symptoms and additional benefits such as better communication with patients.v A retrospective cross -sectional study analyzing the adoption of and patient satisfaction with a PHR reported 25% of patients registered with PHR and reported ove r 90% satisfaction with the PHR, with greatest satisfaction with test results, medication refills, and secure messaging.vi,1 A CDSS electronic checklist specifically aimed to improve delivery of evidence based discharge instructions for patients with hea rt failure (HF) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was evaluated to be effective in increasing delivery of discharge instructions (from 37.2% pre -intervention to 93.0% post -intervention). In addition, prescription of ACE I or ARB in patients with HF and AM I improved to 96.7% from 80.7% and to 100% from 88.1%, respectively.vii An interventional study assessing the effect of patient messaging reminding patients of screening, diagnostic and monitoring tests in accordance with evidence based guidelines found an increase in adherence to clinical recommendations by 12.5% (p<0.001).viii A randomized control trial of 246 patients who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer assessed the effect of a home -based computer system with information, decision -making and emoti onal support. The study found that patients in the intervention group were significantly more competent in seeking information, more comfortable participating in care, and more confident in their interactions with physicians at two months post intervention and had better social support and information competence at five months post intervention. Furthermore, the relative benefits in the intervention group were greater for patients in underserved populations.ix Quality and Safety A randomized control tria l evaluating effect of order venous thromboembolism ( VTE) prophylaxis the intervention resulted in 41% decreased risk for VTE at 90 days.x Using CDS to alert physicians and pharmacists to 8 critical drug interactions resulted in 31% decrease in dispensed drugs known to have adverse interactions.xi A prospective analysis of an antimicrobial surveillance system using evidence based guidelines in a children's hospital showed successful identification of prescribing errors allowing for early interve ntion.xii Analysis of a CDS system intervention aimed at improving asthma documentation and management in the emergency department found that asthma severity, asthma precipitants, ICU admission history and smoking status were recorded significantly more of ten with the CDSS. Additionally, 76% of patients received a discharge asthma plan compared with 16% before the intervention.xiii A prospective cohort study assessed efficacy of CDSS in identifying patients with acute lung injury (ALI) compared to physician diagnosis alone. This study is significant because early treatment of ALI is critical to overall prognosis. The CDSS had a sensitivity of 96.3% and specificity of 89.4% whereas physician diagnosis was 26.5% sensitive and 99.5% specific. Although the CDSS was less specific, physician diagnosis alone missed 239 cases while the CDSS missed 12.xiv A survey of ambulatory care providers assessed attitudes toward CPOE and e -prescribing systems and found that the majority reported improved quality of care and eff iciency, prevention 1 studies including pr oposed stage 2 measure(s) not in stage 1 17 of medical errors, and increased patient satisfaction as advantages to the system. More than one third reported that in the last month they had avoided a medication error because of system alerts In addition, slightly less than half rep orted better counseling of adverse effects and improved monitoring. (Despite this only 47% reported satisfaction with the system. Complaints included alerts regarding medications discontinued, alert fatigue, and alerts inappropriately identifying drug interactions.)xv Implementation of a web -based laboratory information system to treat multi -drug resistant tuberculosis patients in Peru greatly improved timely access to lab results and user satisfaction. The system was expanded to other institutions based on its success to serve a network for over 3.1 million patients. The system is at relatively low cost amounting to 1% of National Peruvian Tuberculosis annual budget.xvi,1 Population Health Population based surveillance system in a large multicenter primary care network identified patients overdue for mammography screening. The interventional study showed that providers successfully contacted 63% of over 3,000 patients at risk.xvii A computer based smoking cessation program designed after extensive review of the literature on the barriers associated with such a program, was found to be effective, inexpensive and required little time or skill from staff. The program was continued fol lowing the conclusion of the study because of the satisfaction rates from providers and patients.xviii Study showed feasibility and reliability of EHR based chronic kidney disease (CKD) registry composed of 57,276 patients in accurately relaying demographics and most comorbidities when compared to individual EHR chart review ( >0.80). Study concluded such a registry has the potential to improve quality of care in this patient population and contribute to the development of a national CKD surveillance project .xix Care Coordination A study assessing the effect of a medication reconciliation program in an ambulatory oncology clinic found at least one error in 81% of all patients' med ication lists. In the group that received the intervention, 90% of incorrect medication lists were corrected, while only 2% were corrected in the control group (p < 0.001).xx 2007 cross -sectional survey of US home health and hospice agencies found 33% in crease in use of EHRs since 2000. The agencies used available EHR functionalities in general, including telemedicine and information sharing.xxi Efficiency Antibiotic approval system guiding use of 28 restricted antibiotics improved appropriate use of antibiotics and led to increased susceptibility of S. aureus to methicillin and of pseudomonas to several antibiotics. Patients with gram negative bacteremia did not suffer increased adver se outcomes as a result.xxii An interventional study (n=2200) compared RBC transfusions in critically ill patients before and after evidence based CDS intervention significant decrease in number of RBC transfusions per patient and percentage of patients tra nsfused (p = 0.045 and p = 0.01 respectively) and net savings of almost $60,000 (n=1100 patients).xxiii 1 studies including pr oposed stage 2 measure(s) not in stage 1 18 i IOM categories as defined in: Race, Ethnicity, and Language Data: Standardization for Health Care Qualit y Improvement Institute of Medicine report, 2009. Of note, these categories are proposed to be used for stage 3, and are not required in proposed stage 2. ii From the Office of Civil Rights: in a given region, a primary language defined as any langua ge spoken by five (5%) percent of the total population eligible to be served or one thousand (1000) persons in that population, whichever is less iii A web portal as defined as online access to health information. Therefore all web portals defined as such a re subject to HIPPA rules and regulations. iv Gustafson DH, Hawkins R, Boberg E, Pingree S, Serlin RE, Graziano F, Chan CL (1999) Impact of a patient - centered, computer -based health information/support system.
