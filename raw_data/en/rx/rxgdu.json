SUMMARY OF CHANGES: We are making technical changes to correct for errors that occurred in converting the Coverage Issues Manual to th e National Coverage Determination (NCD) Manual. We are also making changes to remove coding from the NCDs as the statute exempts coding from NCDs. Specifically, we are deleting the duplicative material in section 20.8.3, 150.4, 160.3, and 160.11. We have deleted 140.1, 150.5, removing utilization paramete rs that were not part of the CIM policy immediately prior to conversion to the NC D manual from section 20.29. We are removing a cross reference to a section de leted above from section 160.7.1. We are deleting inappropriate material form s ection 160.8. We are deleting duplicate information from section 190.2 and inserting a cross reference to the remaining location. We are restoring a portion of a sentence in limitation 7 in section 190.14 that was omitted in the manualization of the final rule a nnouncing the policy that was developed under negotiated rulemaking. We are correcting typographical errors that occurred it the conversion of sections 230.8 and 230.19 from the CIM to the NCD Manual. We are deleting the material in section 270.1.1 that inadvertently was not removed when the updated policy on electrical stimulation for wound healing was promulgated in section 270.1.

A. Covered Conditions Program reimbursement for HBO therapy will be limited to that which is administered in a chamber (including the one man unit) a nd is limited to the following conditions: l . Acute carbon monoxide intoxication, 2 . Decompression illness, 3 . Gas embolism, 4 . Gas gangrene, 5 . Acute traumatic peripheral ischemia. HBO therapy is a valuable adjunctive treatment to be used in combination with accepted standard therapeutic measures when loss of function, limb, or life is threatened. 6. Crush injuries and suturing of severe d limbs. As in the previous conditions, HBO therapy would be an adjunctive treatment when loss of function, limb, or life is threatened. 7 . Progressive necrotizing infec tions (necrotizing fasciitis), 8. Acute Preparation and preservation of comp romised skin grafts (not for primary management of wounds), 10. Chronic refractory osteomyelitis, unr esponsive to conventional medical and surgical management, 11. Osteoradionecrosis as an adjunct to conventiona l treatment, 12. Soft tissue radionecrosis as an adjunct to conventional treatment, 13. Cyanide poisoning, 14. Actinomycosis, only as an adjunct to conventional therapy when the disease process is refractory to antibiotics and surgical treatment, 15. Diabetic wounds of the lower extremities in patients who meet the following three criteria: a. Patient has type I or type II di abetes and has a lower extremity wound that is due to diabetes; b. Patient has a wound classified as Wagner grade III or higher; and c. Patient has failed an adequate course of standard wound therapy. The use of HBO therapy is covered as ad junctive therapy only after there are no measurable signs of healing for at least 30 da ys of treatment with standard wound therapy and must be used in addition to standard wound care. Standard wound care in patients with diabetic wounds includes: assessment of a patient's vascular stat us and correction of any vascular problems in the affected limb if possible, optimization of nutritional status, optimization of glucose control, debridement by any means to remove devitalized tissue, maintenance of a clean, moist bed of granula tion tissue with appropriate moist dressings, appropriate off-loading, and necessary treatm ent to resolve any infection that might be present. Failure to respond to standard wound care occurs when th ere are no measurable signs of healing for at least 30 consecutive da ys. Wounds must be evaluated at least every 30 days during administration of HBO therapy. Continued treatment with HBO therapy is not covered if measurable signs of healing ha ve not been demonstrated within any 30-day period of treatment. B. Noncovered Conditions All other indications not specified under \u00a7270.4(A) are not covered under the Medicare program. No program payment may be made fo r any conditions other than those listed in \u00a7270.4(A). No program payment may be made for HBO in the treatment of the following conditions: 1. Cutaneous, decubitus, and stasis ulcers 2. Chronic peripheral vascular insufficiency 3. Anaerobic septicemia and infection other than clostridial 4. Skin burns (thermal). 5. Senility. 6. Myocardial infarction. 7. Cardiogenic shock. 8. Sickle cell anemia. 9.Acute thermal and chemical pulmonary damage, i.e., smoke inhalation with pulmonary 10. Acute or chronic cerebral vascular insufficiency. 11. Hepatic necrosis. 12. Aerobic septicemia. 13. Nonvascular causes of chronic brain syndrome (Pick's di sease, Alzheimer's disease, Korsakoff's disease) 14. Tetanus. 15. Systemic aerobic infection. 16. Organ transplantation. 17. Organ storage. 18. Pulmonary emphysema. 19. Exceptional blood loss anemia. 20. Multiple Sclerosis. 21. Arthritic Diseases. 22. Acute cerebral edema. C. Topical Application of Oxygen This method of administering oxygen does not meet the definition of HBO therapy as stated above. Also, its clinical efficacy has not been established. Therefore, no Medicare reimbursement may be made for th e topical application of oxygen. Cross reference: \u00a7270.5 of this manual. 40.2 - Home Blood 48, Issued: 03-17-06; Effectiv e/Implementation Dates: 06-19-06) CIM 60-11 There are several different types of blood glucose monitors that use reflectance meters to determine blood glucose levels. Medicare covera ge of these devices varies, with respect to both the type of device and the medical c ondition of the patient for whom the device is prescribed. Reflectance colorimeter devices used for m easuring blood glucose levels in clinical settings are not covered as durable medical equipment for use in the home because their need for frequent professional re-calibra tion makes them unsuitable for home use. However, some types of blood glucose monitors which use a reflectance meter specifically designed for home use by diabetic patients may be covered as durable medical equipment, subject to the cond itions and limitations described below. Blood glucose monitors are meter devices that read color changes produced on specially treated reagent strips by glucose concentrations in the pa tient's blood. The patient, using a disposable sterile lancet, draws a drop of blood, places it on a reagent strip and, following instructions which may vary with th e device used, inserts it into the device to obtain a reading. Lancets, reagent strips , and other supplies necessary for the proper functioning of the device are also covered for patients for whom the device is indicated. Home blood glucose monitors enable certain pa tients to better cont rol their blood glucose levels by frequently checking and appropriately contacting their attending physician for advice and treatment. Studies indicate that th e patient's ability to carefully follow proper procedures is critical to obt aining satisfactory results with these devices. In addition, the cost of the devices, with their supplies, limits economical use to patients who must make frequent checks of their blood glucose leve ls. Accordingly, coverage of home blood glucose monitors is limited to pati ents meeting the following conditions: 1. The patient has been diagnosed as having diabetes; 2. The patient's physician states that the patient is capable of bei ng trained to use the particular device prescribed in an appropriate manner. In some cases, the patient may not be able to perform this function, but a res ponsible individual can be trained to use the equipment and monitor the patient to assure that the intended effect is achieved. This is permissible if the record is properly documented by the patient's physician; and 3. The device is designed for home rather than clinical use. There is also a blood glucose monitoring system designed especially for use by those with visual impairments. The monitors used in such systems are identical in terms of reliability and sensitivity to the standard blood glucose monitors described above. They differ by having such features as voice synt hesizers, automatic timers, and specially designed arrangements of supplies and materials to enable the visually impaired to use the equipment without assistance. These special blood glucose monitoring sy stems are covered under Medicare if the following conditions are met: The patient and device meet the three c onditions listed above for coverage of standard home blood glucose monitors; and The patient's physician certifies that he or she has a visual impairment severe enough to require use of this special monitoring system. The additional features and equipment of these special systems justify a higher reimbursement amount than allowed for sta ndard blood glucose monitors. Separately identify claims for such devi ces and establish a separate re imbursement amount for them. 80.11 35-16 Vitrectomy be considered reasonable and necessary for the following conditions: vitreous loss incident to cataract surgery, vi treous opacities due to vitreous hemorrhage or other causes, retinal detachments secondary to vitreous strands, proliferative retinopathy, and vitreous retraction. See chapter 23 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual for how to determine payment for physician vitr ectomy services and the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 14, \"Ambulator y Surgical Centers,\" \u00a740, for how to determine payment for ASC facility vitrectomy services. Also, see the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 23, \"Fee Schedule Administration and Coding Requirements,\" \u00a720.9, to identify when, for Medicare payment purposes, certain vitrectomy codes are included in other codes or when codes for other services include vitrectomy codes. 140.1 - Abortion Dates: CIM 35-99 Abortions are not covered Medicare procedures except: 1. If the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or 2. In the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed. 150.5 - Diathermy Treatment diathermy machin es have been found to produce some degree of therapeutic benefit for essentially the sa me conditions and to the same extent as standard diathermy. Accordingly, where th e contractor's medical staff has determined that the pulsed wave diathermy apparatus used is one which is considered therapeutically effective, the treatments are considered a covered service, but onl y for those conditions for which standard diathermy is medical ly indicated and only when rendered by a physician or incident to a phys ician's professional services . Cross-reference: \u00a7240.3 . 160.7.1 - Assessing Patients Suitabilit y Therapy (Rev. 48, Issued: 03-17-06; Effectiv e/Implementation Dates: 06-19-06) CIM 35-46 Electrical is an accepted modality for assessing a patient's suitability for ongoing treatment with a transcutaneous or an implanted nerve stimulator. Accordingly, program payment may be made for the following techniques when used to determine the potential therapeutic useful ness of an electrical nerve stimulator: A. Transcutaneous Electric al Nerve Stimulation (TENS) This technique involves attachment of a transc utaneous nerve stimulat or to the surface of the skin over the peripheral nerve to be stimulated. It is used by the patient on a trial basis and its effectiveness in modulating pain is monitored by the physician, or physical therapist. Generally, the physician or physical therapist is able to determine whether the patient is likely to derive a significant th erapeutic benefit from continuous use of a transcutaneous stimulator within a trial period of one month; in a few cases this determination may take longer to make. Document the medical necessity for such services which are furnished beyond the first month. (See \u00a7160.13 for an explanation of coverage of medically necessary supplies for the effective use of TENS.) If TENS significantly alleviates pain, it may be considered as primary treatment; if it produces no relief or greater discomfort than th e original pain electr ical nerve stimulation therapy is ruled out. However, where TENS produces incomplete relief, further evaluation with percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may be considered to determine whether an implanted peripheral nerve stimul ator would provide significant relief from pain. Usually, the physician or physical therapist providing the services will furnish the equipment necessary for assessment. Where the physician or physical therapist advises the patient to rent the TENS from a supplie r during the trial period rather than supplying it himself/herself, program payment may be ma de for rental of the TENS as well as for the services of the physician or physical therapist who is eval uating its use. However, the combined program payment which is made for the physician's or physical therapist's services and the rental of the stimulator from a supplier should not exceed the amount which would be payable for the total servic e, including the stimulator, furnished by the physician or physical therapist alone. B. Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (PENS) This diagnostic procedure which involves stimulation of peripheral nerves by a needle electrode inserted through the skin is perfor med only in a physician's office, clinic, or hospital outpatient department. Therefore, it is covered only when performed by a physician or incident to physician's servic e. If pain is effectively controlled by percutaneous stimulation, implanta tion of electrodes is warranted. As in the case of TENS (described in subsection A), generally the physician should be able to determine whether the patient is likely to derive a significant therapeutic benefit from continuing use of an implanted nerve stimul ator within a trial period of 1 month. In a few cases, this determination may take longer to make. The medical necessity for such diagnostic services which are furnished be yond the first month must be documented. NOTE: Electrical nerve stimulators do not prevent pain but only alleviate pain as it occurs. A patient can be taught how to empl oy the stimulator, and once this is done, can use it safely and effectively without direct physician superv ision. Consequently, it is inappropriate for a patient to visit his/her phys ician, physical therapis t, or an outpatient clinic on a continuing basis for treatment of pain with electr ical nerve stimulation. Once it is determined that electri cal nerve stimulation should be continued as therapy and the patient has been trained to use the stimulator , it is expected that a stimulator will be implanted or the patient will employ the TEN S on a continual basis in his/her home. Electrical nerve stimulation tr eatments furnished by a physician in his/her office, by a physical therapist or outpatient clinic are excluded from coverage by \u00a71862(a)(1) of the Act. (See \u00a7160.7 for an explanation of coverage of the therapeutic use of implanted peripheral nerve stimulators under the prosthetic devices benefit. See \u00a7280.13 for an explanation of coverage of the therapeutic use of TEN S under the durable medical equipment benefit.) 160.8 - Electroencephalographic Monitoring During Surgical Procedures Involving th e Vasculature is a safe and reliable technique for the assessment of gross cerebral blood flow during general anesthesia a nd is covered under Medicare. Very characteristic changes in the EEG occur when cerebral perfusion is inadequate for ce rebral function. EEG monitoring as an indirect measure of cerebral perfusion requires the ex pertise of an electroencephalogr apher, a neurologist trained in EEG, or an advanced EEG technician for its proper interpretation. The EEG monitoring may be covered routinely in carotid endarterectomies and in other neurological procedures where cerebral pe rfusion could be reduced. Such other procedures might include aneurysm surgery where hypotensive anesthesia is used or other cerebral vascular procedures wher e cerebral blood flow may be interrupted. 190.2 - Diagnostic Pap Smears pap smear and related medica lly necessary services are covered under Medicare Part B when ordered by a physician under one of the following conditions: Previous cancer of the cervix, uterus, or va gina that has been or is presently being treated; Previous abnormal pap smear; Any abnormal findings of the vagina, cervix, uterus, ovaries, or adnexa; Any significant complaint by the patien t referable to the female reproductive system; or Any signs or symptoms that might in the physician's judgment reasonably be related to a gynecologic disorder. Screening Pap Smears and Pelvic Examinations for Early Detection of Cervical or Vaginal Cancer . (See section 210.2.) 190.14 - Human Immunodeficiency Virus 03-17-06; Effectiv e/Implementation Dates: 06-19-06) PM AB-02-100 Diagnosis of HIV infection is primarily made through the use of serologic assays. These assays take one of two forms: antibody dete ction assays and specific HIV antigen (p24) procedures. The antibody assays are usually enzyme immunoassays (EIA), which are used to confirm exposure of an individual's immune system to specific viral antigens. These assays may be formatted to detect HIV-1, HIV-2, or HIV-1 and 2 simultaneously and to detect both IgM and IgG. When the initial EIA test is repeatedly positive or indeterminant, an alternative test is used to confirm the specificity of the antibodies to individual viral components. The most commonly use method is the Western Blot. The HIV-1 core antigen (p24) test detects ci rculating viral antigen which may be found prior to the development of antibodies and may al so be present in later stages of illness in the form of recurrent or persistent antigenem ia. Its prognostic utility in HIV infection has been diminished as a result of development of sensitive viral RNA assays, and its primary use today is as a routine screeni ng tool in potential blood donors. In several unique situations, serologic tes ting alone may not reliably establish an HIV infection. This may occur because the anti body response (particularly the IgG response detected by Western Blot) has not yet develope d (that is, acute retroviral syndrome) or is persistently equivocal because of inherent viral antigen variability. It is also an issue in perinatal HIV infection due to transplacental passage of maternal HIV antibody. In these situations, laboratory evidence of HIV in blood by culture, antigen assays, or proviral DNA or viral RNA assays, is required to es tablish a definitive determination of HIV infection. Indications Diagnostic testing to establish HIV infection may be indicated when there is a strong clinical suspicion supported by one or mo re of the following clinical findings: 1. The patient has a documented, otherwis e unexplained, AIDS-defining or AIDS- associated opportunistic infection. 2. The patient has another documented sexually transmitted disease, which identifies significant risk of exposure to HIV and the poten tial for an early or subclinical infection. 3. The patient has documented acute or chr onic hepatitis B or C infection that identifies a significant risk of exposure to HIV and the potential for an early or subclinical infection. 4. The patient has a documented AIDS-def ining or AIDS-associated neoplasm. 5. The patient has a documented AIDS-associated neurologic disorder or otherwise unexplained dementia. 6. The patient has another documented AIDS -defining clinical condition, or a history of other severe, recurr ent, or persistent conditions which suggest an underlying immune deficiency (for example, cutaneous or mucosal disorders). 7. The patient has otherwise unexplaine d generalized signs and symptoms suggestive of a chronic process with an unde rlying immune deficiency (for example, fever, weight loss, malaise, fatigue, chroni c diarrhea, failure to thrive, chronic cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, or lymphadenopathy). 8. The patient has otherwise unexplained la boratory evidence of a chronic disease process with an underlying immune defici ency (for example, anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, lymphopenia, or low CD4+ lymphocyte count). 9. The patient has signs and symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome with fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash, 10. The patient has documented exposure to blood or body fluids known to be capable of transmitting HIV (for example, needlesticks and other significant blood exposures) and antiviral ther apy is initiated or antici pated to be initiated. 11. The patient is undergoing treatment for rape . (HIV testing is part of the rape treatment protocol.) Limitations 1. HIV antibody testing in the United States is usually performed using HIV-1 or HIV-1/2 combination tests. HI V-2 testing is indicated if c linical circumstances suggest HIV-2 is likely (that is, compatible clinical finding and HIV-1 te st negative). HIV-2 testing may also be indicated in areas of the country where there is greater prevalence of HIV-2 infections. 2. The Western Blot test should be perfo rmed only after documentation that the initial EIA tests are repeatedly posi tive or equivocal on a single sample. 3. The HIV antigen tests currently ha ve no defined diagnostic usage. 4. Direct viral RNA detection may be perfor med in those situations where serologic testing does not establish a dia gnosis but strong clinical susp icion persists (for example, acute retroviral syndrome, nonspecific serolo gic evidence of HIV, or perinatal HIV infection). 5. If initial serologic tests confirm an HIV in fection, repeat testing is not indicated. 6. If initial serologic tests are HIV EIA negative and there is no indication for confirmation of infection by viral RNA detection, the interval prior to retesting is 3-6 months. 7. Testing for evidence of HIV infection us ing serologic methods may be medically appropriate in situations where th ere is a risk of exposure to HIV . However, in the absence of a documented AIDS defining or HIV -associated disease, an HIV-associated sign or symptom, or documented exposure to a known HIV-infected source, the testing is considered by Medicare to be screening and thus is not covered by Medicare (for example, history of multiple blood component transfusions, exposure to blood or body fluids not resulting in considera tion of therapy, history of tran splant, history of illicit drug use, multiple sexual partners, same-sex encounters, prostitution, or contact with prostitutes). 8. The CPT Editorial Panel has issued a nu mber of codes for infectious agent detection by direct antigen or nucleic acid probe techniques that have not yet been developed or are only being used on an inve stigational basis. La boratory providers are advised to remain current on FDA- approved status for these tests. Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual Chapter 1, Part 4 (Sections 200 - 310.1) Coverage Determinations Table of Effectiv e/Implementation Dates: 06-19-06) CIM 50-55 Covered A. General Section 4103 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provides for coverage of certain prostate cancer screening tests subject to certain coverage, frequency, and payment limitations. Medicare will cover prostate cance r screening tests/procedures for the early detection of prostate cancer. Coverage of prostate cance r screening tests includes the following procedures furnished to an individual for the early detection of prostate cancer: Screening digital rectal examination; and Screening prostate specific antigen blood test. B. Screening Digital Rectal Examinations Screening digital rectal examinations are c overed at a frequency of once every 12 months for men who have attained age 50 (at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last Medicare-covered screening di gital rectal examination was performed). Screening digital rectal examination means a clinical examination of an individual's prostate for nodules or other abnormalities of the prostate. This screening must be performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in \u00a71861(r)(1) of the Act), or by a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife (as defined in \u00a71861(aa) and \u00a71861(gg) of the Act) who is authorized under State law to perform the examination, fu lly knowledgeable about the beneficiary's medical condition, and would be responsible for using the results of any examination performed in the overall management of th e beneficiary's specific medical problem. C. Screening Prostate Specific Antigen Tests Screening prostate specific antigen tests are covered at a frequency of once every 12 months for men who have attained age 50 (a t least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last Medicare-covered sc reening prostate specific antigen test was performed). Screening prostate specific antigen tests (PSA) means a test to detect the marker for adenocarcinoma of prostate. PSA is a reliable immunocytochemical marker for primary and metastatic adenocarcinoma of prostate. This screening must be ordered by the beneficiary's physician or by the beneficiary's physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwif e (the term \"attending physician\" is defined in \u00a71861(r)(1) of the Act to mean a doctor of medicine or osteopathy and the terms \"physicia n assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife\" are defined in \u00a71861(aa) and \u00a71861(gg) of the Act) who is fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary's medical condition, and who would be responsible for using the results of any examination (test) performed in the overall management of the beneficiar y's specific medical problem. 210.2 - Screening Pap Smears and Pelvic Examinations for Early Detection of Cervical or Vaginal Cancer (Rev. 48, Issued: 03-17-06; Effectiv e/Implementation Dates: A screening pap smear and related medically necessary services provided to a woman for the early detection of cervical cancer (including collection of the sample of cells and a physician's interpretation of the test results) and pelvic examinati on (including clinical breast examination) are covered under Medica re Part B when ordered by a physician (or authorized practitioner) under one of the following conditions: She has not had such a test during the preceding two years or is a woman of childbearing age ( \u00a71861(nn) of the Act). There is evidence (on the basis of her medical history or other findings) that she is at high risk of developing cervical cancer and her physician (or authorized practitioner) recommends that she have the test performed more frequently than every two years. High risk factors for cervi cal and vaginal cancer are: Early onset of sexual activity (under 16 years of age) Multiple sexual partners (five or more in a lifetime) History of sexually transmitted disease (including HIV infection) Fewer than three negative or any pap smears within the previous seven years; and DES (diethylstilbestrol) - exposed daughters of women who took DES during pregnancy. NOTE: Claims for pap smears must indicate the be neficiary's low or high risk status by including the appropriate ICD-9-CM on the line item (Item 24E of the Form CMS-1500). Definitions A woman as described in \u00a71861(nn) of the Act is a woman who is of childbearing age and has had a pap smear test during any of the preceding three years that indicated the presence of cervical or vagi nal cancer or other abnormality, or is at high risk of developing cervical or vaginal cancer. A woman of childbearing age is one who is premenopausal and has been determined by a physician or other qualified pr actitioner to be of ch ildbearing age, based upon the medical history or other findings. Other qualified practitioner, as defined in 42 CFR 410.56(a) includes a certified nurse midwife (as defined in \u00a71861(gg ) of the Act), or a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nu rse specialist (as defined in \u00a71861(aa) of the Act) who is authorized under State law to perform the examination. Screening Pelvic Examination Section 4102 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provides for coverage of screening pelvic examinations (including a clinical breast examination) for all female beneficiaries, subject to certain frequency and other lim itations. A screening pelvic examination (including a clinical breast ex amination) should include at least seven of the following eleven elements: Inspection and palpation of breasts for masses or lumps, tenderness, symmetry, or nipple discharge. Digital rectal examination including sphincter tone, presence of hemorrhoids, and rectal masses. Pelvic examination (with or without specimen collection for smears and cultures) including: External genitalia (for exam ple, general appearance, hair distribution, or lesions). Urethral meatus (for example, size, location, lesions, or prolapse). Urethra (for example, masses, tenderness, or scarring). Bladder (for example, fullness, masses, or tenderness). Vagina (for example, general appearan ce, estrogen effect, discharge lesions, pelvic support, cystoc ele, or rectocele). Cervix (for example, general a ppearance, lesions, or discharge). Uterus (for example, size, contour, position, mobility, tenderness, consistency, descent, or support). Adnexa/parametria (for example, ma sses, tenderness, organomegaly, or nodularity). Anus and perineum. This description is from Documentation Guidelines for Evaluation and Management Services, published in May 1997 and was de veloped by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Am erican Medical Association. 230.8 - Non-Implantable Pelvic Floor provide neurom uscular electrical stimulation through the pelvic floor with the intent of strengthening and exercising pelvic floor m usculature. S timulation is generally delivered by vaginal or anal probes connected to an extern al puls e generator. The m ethods of pelvic f loor ele ctrical ity duration (duty cycle), treatm ents per day, num ber of treatm ent days per week, length of time for each treatm ent session, overall tim e period for device use and between clinic and hom e settings.

Deficiency can occur due to a congenital defect in synthesis or utilizati on, or fro m dialysis. Th e causes of carnitine deficiency in hem odialysis patients include dialy tic loss, r educed renal synthesis and reduced d ietary in take. Intrav enous levocarnitin e, for one of the fo llowin g indication s, will only be covered f or those ESRD patients who have been on di alysis for a m inimum of three months. professio nally accepted m ethod as recognized in curren t literature), along with signs a nd sym ptoms of : Erythropoietin -resis tant anem t hematocrit < 30 p ercent with treatm ent) that has not responded to standa rd erthropoietin dosage (that which is considered clinically appropriate to treat the particular patient) with iron replacement, and for which other causes have been inves tigated and adequately treated, or Hypotension on hemodialysis that interferes with delivery of the intended dialysis despite application of usual measures deemed appropriate (e.g., fluid management). Such episodes of hypotension must have occurred during at least 2 dialysis treatments in a 30- day period. Continued use of levocarnitine will not be covered if improvement has not been demonstrated within 6 months of initiati on of treatment. All other indications for levocarnitine are noncovered in the ESRD population. For a patient currently receiving intrave nous levocarnitine, Medicare will cover continued treatment if: Levocarnitine has been administered to treat erythropoietin-resistent anemia (persistent hematocrit < 30 per cent with treatment) that has not responded to standard erythropoietin dosage (that which is consider ed clinically appropriate to treat the particular patient) with iron replacement, and for which other causes have been investigated and adequately treated, or hypotension on hemodialysis th at interferes with delivery of the intended dialysis despite application of usual measures deemed appropriate (e.g., fluid management) and su ch episodes of hypotension occur during at least 2 dialysis treatments in a 30-day period; and The patient's medical record documents a pre-dialysis plasma free carnitine level < 40 micromol/L prior to the initiation of treatment; or The treating physician certifies (documents in the medical record) that in his/her judgment, if treatment with th e levocarnitine is discontinued, the patient's pre-dialysis carnitine level would fall below 40 micromo l/L and the patient would have recurrent erythropoietin-resistant-anemia or intradialytic hypotension. 260.1 - e/Implementation Dates: 06-19-06) CIM 35-53 A.
