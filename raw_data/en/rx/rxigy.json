Have you had any new symptoms? Are you having any problems with your medi - cations?\" And of course, your mom or dad may have ques - tions too: \"What can I do about feeling so tired all the time? Why are my legs so stiff? Am I taking the right medi - cines?\" The doctor may test vision, walking, reflexes (that's what the hammer is for!), strength, and a lot of other things that can be changed by MS. Based on this examination, the doctor may want to add or change a medica - tion or do some more tests\u2014maybe a blood test or another MRI.Did you ever wonder what happens when your mom or dad vis - its the MS doctor? Regular check-ups give the doctor a chance to find out how your mom or dad is doing, and they give your mom or dad a chance to ask questions. This helps the doc - tor find any small problems before they become big ones. The doctor begins by asking some questions:Sometimes the doctor needs to examine your mom or dad.OFFICEA VISIT TO THE By the time the visit is over, both your parent and the doctor have learned important things that will help them work together to reduce the effects of MS. 2HEAD Multiple sclerosis (MS for short) is a disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord). The brain is like a computer that tells the body what to do. The spinal cord is like a thick wire attached to the computer. Messages trav - el from the brain, along the spinal cord, to the other parts of the body. When a person has MS, the covering (myelin) MSthat protects the nerves gets damaged. Scars form where the myelin is dam - aged. As messages travel from the brain, they some - times get stuck or slowed down by these scars. When this happens, the other parts of the body can't always do what the brain is telling them to do. Sometimes people with MS have trouble seeing. Sometimes their arms and legs feel weak, or their skin feels \"tingly\"(like pins and needles). Some- times they lose their bal - ance, or sometimes it's hard to walk. MS prob - lems like these are called \"symptoms.\" Symptoms of MS can come and go... we don't know exactly why. Sometimes you don't even notice the symptoms. At other times they are pretty obvious. It's hard for a person with MS to know from one day to the next how he or she will feel. That is why we say that MS is unpredictable. Interesting Fact: Multiple means many. Sclerosis means scars. So, multiple sclerosis means \"many scars.\" A Where do you send a sick wasp? SINCE YOU'VE ASKED... The shots your grandma takes won't make her MS go away, but they can slow it down. These medicines aren't a cure for MS but they are the best treatment we have right now. Scientists are working very hard to find new medicines to make MS go away all together. That is something we all would like to see!JOKESTo a wasp-ital Why don't the shots my grandma takes for her MS make the MS go away?Q What says \"quick, quick\"? . A duck with hiccupsHEAD 3Hi, my name is Michelle . I am 12 years old, a 7th grader in middle school in Denver, P A. I have four brothers and a step sister. You and I already have something in common. We have some - one we love who has been 'attacked' by the multiple sclerosis monster. For me this is my mom. Though she seems normal most of the time, there have been times MS has caused lots of problems for all of us. For example, one morning I was home sick from school and my mom had to write a note for me to be excused. I rushed to give my mom a pen and paper to write my note. As she began writing, the pen kept slipping out of her hand and she could not write. It was just a bunch of scribbles. My mom began crying and I knew that the MS monster had attacked again. I ended up writing the letter for her and my dad came home later to sign it. I hate MS! Well, one good thing that I know helps me with my fears is that I began attend - ing the seminars my mom goes to at the MS Society. Most of the time, I am the youngest one there! I don't mind though, because I get to learn a lot of information about the \"monster\" and I ask a lot of questions. My mom started to take daily injections for her MS. Talk about another shocking site! My brothers and I watched my mom as she explained what she had to do. At first I felt it was horrible to see a needle going into her soft skin. Then mom explained how this could help slow down the MS.Mom decided since this would be a daily routine, we would each learn to administer it in case she couldn't. I named the injection, \"Spike.\" Spike was named since he's now part of the family. I still feel afraid at times, but I understand better how the 'monster' works. If you ever feel afraid, worried, or confused, remember, we are all in this together. When you aren't feeling well, the doctor examines you to find out what's the matter. Maybe the doctor checks your throat, or looks in your ears, or listens to your chest. By examining you this way, your doc - tor is usually able to diagnose, or figure out the problem and give you the right medicine. Unfortunately, MS is a disease that is very difficult to diag - nose. The doctor can't tell by looking or listening, and there isn't a simple test that can show for sure if a person has MS. So, it may take a long time for a person to find out if MS is causing the problems he o r she is having. When the person in your family with MS first began to have problems or symp - toms, the doctor started by asking lots of questions: \"How do you feel? What problems are you having? Have you felt anything like this before?\" The doctor 4looked in the person's eyes, watched the person walk, and used a reflex hammer to test knee and ankle reflexes. The doctor also checked the person's arms and legs to see how strong they were and if there was any stiff - ness in them. There are spe - cial tests that can help a doctor diagnose MS. An MRI (those letters stand for magnetic resonance imaging) is a special pic - ture that is almost like an x-ray. It shows the changes or scars that MS can cause in a person's brain and spi - nal cord. A spinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture) is a test to find out if the liquid around the per - son's spinal cord has any changes in it that can be caused by MS. Another test, called a VEP (visual evoked poten - tial), can tell if the mes - sages going from the eyes to the brain are moving more slowly than they should.The doctor uses all this information to decide if the problem is MS, and to make sure that there isn't any other problem or disease that could be causing the symptoms the person is having. Once the doctor has decided that MS is the problem, treat - ment can begin. We don't have a cure for MS yet, but we have several different ways to treat it and help people feel better. There are medicines to slow the disease and keep it from getting worse. P eople taking these medicines have to give themselves shots. Nobody likes to get a shot, but these shots are the best treatment we have for MS! MS can cause many kinds of problems or symptoms, like making people feel very tired or stiff or weak. The doctor knows about different types of medi - cines that can make these problems feel better. There are Diagnosing T reating5also medicines for relapses (also called exacerbations). They may feel very tired, or have new problems that they never had before\u2014 like trouble seeing or walking or remembering things. When this happens, they may be given a special medicine called methylprednisolone. (Isn't that a mouthful?) This is a liquid medicine that drips through a needle into the person's arm. Some people get this medicine at home and other people go to the hospital for a few days to get it. A therapist who can help people with MS learn how to do day-to-day activities more easily and in a less tiring way.Someone who helps people learn about taking medi cines and how to be as healthy as they can in spite of MS. A person who helps families talk about MS together .Besides medicines, there are lots of other things that can help people with MS to feel better: exercise, rest, a healthy diet, and having fun!When someone has MS, they may go to see dif - ferent types of doctors and therapists who can help them feel better. Here are some of those people and what they do to help people with MS.

This is complex material and not easy to explain to young children. One of the underlying messages is that physicians and other health care special - ists are there to help you and will work with you to be sure you are as healthy as you can be. You might consider hav - ing your child accom - pany you to a medical appointment; for exam - ple, a routine physician appointment or physical therapy visit. Speak to your health care provid - er in advance, to be sure it is OK and to discuss what might take place during the appointment. Avoid bringing your child to an appointment that might involve a painful proce - dure or unwelcome news. Read the Keep S'myelin Kids cartoon together to talk about how going to an appointment together might reduce anxiety for your child. Talk about the various MS specialists who are there to help you. Do the word search together and read the article about MS specialists. Talking aboutthese various profession - als can be reassuring to your child. If you take one of the MS disease-modifying agents, reading this issue together may facilitate a conversation about why the drug does not make MS go away all together. This is a good opportuni - ty to talk about how sci - entists are doing research to develop treatments that stop MS progression or reverse damage to the central nervous system. It is OK to tell children that there are still unan - swered questions about MS. We don't yet know how to cure MS, but we are moving closer to that goal every year.How to Read This Issue of Keep S'myelin with Your Kids2PARENTS' PULL OUT How do you choose the right medical treatment from everything that is available to you? This is one of the biggest ques - tions you face as a person with MS. Not so long ago, you wouldn't have had a choice. Your doctor would have decided for you from a limited list of possibili - ties. But today there are several treatments for MS itself and a long list of ways to manage MS symp - toms. You can no longer afford to be passive about the medical care you receive. In order to under - stand and evaluate your options, you must be an active, informed consumer. This is even more impor - tant should you choose to pursue an alternative or complementary therapy. Here, it is much harder to identify and evaluate the risks and benefits. Therapies range from the widely accepted to the truly bizarre. To protect Gather information. Carefully and thoroughly inquire about any therapy you are considering. Ask: What does the treatment involve? How and why is it sup - posed to work? How effective is it? What are the risks? How much does it cost? Contact a variety of sourc - es to get reliable, objective information. Begin by call - ing the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at 1-800- FIGHT-MS (1-800-344- 4867). Discuss the therapy with your doctor. Find out if the alterna - tive practitioner works with conventional doctors. Talk to people who have used the treatment. Investigate the back - ground of any treatment provider. How do you know what to avoid and what might be worth a try? Here's how to decide whether a particular treatment is right for you.Clear Thinking About Alternative Therapiesyour health and your pocketbook, you must track down and scrutinize information from as many sources as possible. The term \"alternative\" is difficult to define. When applied to health care, it encompasses everything from drugs and diets to food supplements, men - tal exercises, hands-on techniques, and lifestyle changes. Alternative thera - pies come from many disciplines and traditions. They include acupuncture, aromatherapy, Ayurvedic medicine, biofeedback, chiropractic, guided imag - ery, herbal medicine, homeopathy, hypnosis, hypnotherapy, iridology, macrobiotics, naturopa - thy, reflexology, relaxation techniques, traditional Chinese medicine, yoga, \"touch therapy,\" and vari - ous schools of massage, among others. Recent research indicate that about sixty per cent of people with MS have tried some form of non-conven - tional therapy.What are alternative therapies?3PARENTS' PULL OUT You will be connected to your local chapter. Ask them to add your name to the Keep S'myelin distribution list. IT'S FREE! Keep S'myelin is published quarterly by the National MS Society. Past issues are also available at your local chapter. Find out how much experience this person has had treating people with MS. Thoroughly investigate any clinic that requires inpatient stays. Be particu - larly vigilant about getting information on any clinic, in the U.S. or abroad, that will not treat you as an outpatient. Determine the costs. Some alternative therapies cost thousands of dollars, and most are not covered by health insurance. Proceed with caution. Do not abandon your con - ventional therapy. Only use alternative therapy in addition to, not in place of, your current treatment. Keep your doctor up to date. .
