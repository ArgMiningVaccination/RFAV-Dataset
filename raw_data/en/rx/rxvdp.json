Introduction Fever is a common, yet frightening, physiologic response that has been the source of great consternation throughout the history of medicine. Hippocrates believed that illness wascaused by imbalance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) andthat fever \"cooked\" the excess humor, thereby bringing the body back to normalhomeostasis. Fever has been respected by many physicians, including Thomas Sydenham,who wrote in the 1600s, \"Fever is a mighty engine which Nature brings into the world forconquest of her enemies.\" (1) In recent times, fever has become a product of disease thatis feared by parents and clinicians alike. (2)(3)(4) Whether embraced or feared, fever plays an important role in the physiologic response during illness. In fact, the ability to mount a febrile response to infection has been shownto increase survival rates in many animal species. Even many cold-blooded animals show aninnate ability to increase body temperature in response to infection. For example, to raisebody temperature during certain illnesses, lizards may remain in the sun and sh tend toswim in warmer water. It is difcult to believe that this primitive, almost universal, responsewould have survived millions of years of evolution if it did not present some overall benetin ghting disease. In fact, fever may have a positive effect on host leukocyte mobility andactivity, activation of T lymphocytes, and production of interferon. Fever also may inhibitbacterial and viral function. However, these theoretical advantages come at the cost ofhypermetabolism, increased insensible fluid loss, and general discomfort. Thus, fever is justone of many acute-phase responses to infection, and although the advantages of fever arewell founded in animal models in terms of survival, its role in humans should be consideredin the context of the individual patient and not on the basis of survival of the species. Forexample, although some elevation of body temperature likely is benecial in childrenwhose host responses are normal, severe elevation of temperature or any fever in childrenwho have immunologic decits may be detrimental. Maintenance of Body Temperature An intricate interaction among autonomic, endocrine, andbehavioral mechanisms allows normal body temperature toremain relatively constant despite large variations in severalfactors, including ambient temperature and physical activity.The center of the temperature control system lies in thethermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus. This special-ized group of neurons maintains the body's temperature \"setpoint\" by acting as a central thermostat. As a result of inputfrom both peripheral receptors and the temperature of blood *Professor of Clinical Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Chief, Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Children's Hospital at Monteore, Bronx, NY.Abbreviations Vol.30 January 2009 5around the hypothalamus, the thermoregulatory center modulates various body mechanisms to maintain thephysiologic set point. Body temperature elevates primarily through heat generation and heat conservation. Heat production oc-curs at the cellular level by increased cellular metabolismthat liberates energy during the splitting of adenosinetriphosphate. This process occurs in various organ sys-tems, including the skeletal muscles, brown adipose tis-sue, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Due to the largeamount of skeletal muscle, increased activity, usually dueto involuntary shivering, can generate a signicantamount of body heat in a relatively short time. In addition to heat production, autonomic responses such as vasoconstriction of the blood vessels closest tothe skin surface as well as behavioral responses such asseeking a warmer environment (eg, putting on moreclothes or curling up into a fetal position) assist in heatconservation and, thereby, raise body temperature. Con-versely, reduction of body temperature occurs throughmechanisms that increase heat loss, such as obligate heatloss through the skin and lungs, peripheral vasodilata-tion, increased evaporative loss through sweating, andcold preference behavior. Changes in the thermoregulatory set point involve a complex set of cytokine-mediated responses and produc-tion of acute-phase reactants. Pyrogens, substances thatproduce fever, may be of viral orbacterial metabolism (eg, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, acell wall product of gram-negative bacteria). In addition,various internal mediators, such as antigen-antibodycomplexes and complement components, may act aspyrogens. Such pyrogens stimulate host monocytes,macrophages, and other inflammatory cells to releasepyrogenic cytokines (eg, interleukin-1-alpha, inter-leukin-1-beta, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon) intothe circulatory system. Because many of these cytokinesdo not cross the blood-brain barrier readily, it is not clearwhether they act directly or indirectly on the preopticarea of the hypothalamus. Regardless of the precise mechanism, this activity results in an increased production of prostaglandin of theE series that eventually raises the thermoregulatory setpoint. Although the increase in the set point varies withfactors dependent on both the host and the incitingorganism, the upper threshold of temperature appears tobe limited. It is likely that the mechanisms that lead to anelevated set point have some negative feedback throughthe cryogens limit temperature height during fever in otherwise healthy hosts. An important caveat to thermoregulation is that neo- nates and children afflicted with diseases of the centralnervous system may have immature or abnormal thermo-regulatory centers or mediator responses and, therefore,not manifest fever in response to certain infections. Fever occurs when an increase in the thermoregula- tory set point eventually results in an increase in deepbody temperature. This process begins when the increasein the set point causes the existing body temperature tobe lower than the new set point. At this point, thepreviously described mechanisms lead to increased heatproduction. Clinically, the child begins to shiver, feelcold, and develop cool extremities due to vasoconstric-tion and seeks a warm environment (eg, under blankets).During this \"chill\" phase of the febrile response, heartrate and respiratory rate increase, functional changesoccur in the GI tract, and appetite is lost. The \"chill\"happens as the body temperature begins to rise towardthe set point and, thus, normally precedes the actual risein body temperature. With time, the body temperatureincreases to be in balance with the new set point. Feverresolution begins with the lowering of the set point backtoward normal body temperature, usually due to resolu-tion of the illness or administration of an antipyretic. Asthe set point lowers, the body temperature is left higherthan the new set point. The physiologic mechanisms thatlead to heat loss are manifested clinically with skinwarmth due to vasodilatation, sweating, and the seekingof a cooler environment until the new equilibrium isreached. This often is referred to as the \"flush\" phase.A summary of the phases of the febrile response is shownin the Figure. Normal Body Temperature and Measurement Until the advent of modern clinical thermometry, mea-surement of body temperature consisted primarily ofusing the hand to detect differences in skin temperature.There was no consensus as to baseline normal bodytemperature until 1868, when Carl Wunderlich reportedthat 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C) was the mean adult temperature,based on his report of 1 million temperature readings inmore than 25,000 patients via a foot-long thermometerused in the axilla. (5) Although the eventually with normal body temperature, at least until morerened measurements and oral thermometry were used. A normal diurnal variation in body temperature isinfectious diseases acute fever 6Pediatrics in Review Vol.30 No.1 January 2009maintained even during the febrile response. Under nor- mal circumstances, body temperature varies as much as0.5\u00b0C from the mean, being lowest in the morning(between 4:00 AMand 8:00 AM) and peaking in the early evening (4:00 PMto 6:00 PM). (6) Body temperature also can vary somewhat with a variety of specic individualand environmental factors, including age (slightly higherin young infants), sex, physical activity, and ambient airtemperature. Thus, it is clear that there can be no singlevalue for normal body temperature. Temperature measurement also varies with anatomic site. Core body temperature is measured most accuratelyat the pulmonary artery, but close approximation can bedetermined at other deep tissue locations such as thelower esophagus or the nasopharynx. Because these lo-cations are difcult to access, more peripheral locations generally areused because they are easier to ac-cess, are safe, and are comfortablefor the child. However, such indi-rect measurements are more proneto artifact and have some associatedlag time relative to the core temper-ature. The axilla was one of the rst locations used for temperaturemeasurement, although skin tem-perature lags behind changes incore temperature, especially duringthe early phase of the febrile re-sponse when vasoconstriction coolsthe skin while simultaneously rais-ing core body temperature. In ad-dition, skin cooling from sweatingand evaporation can affect accu-racy. Thus, axillary temperature haslow sensitivity and often is inaccu-rate and imprecise. (7) The oral method, in which the thermometer is placed in the sub-lingual pocket, is safe and comfort-able for children older than 5 yearsof age. Oral measurement has lesslag time and is more accurate thanaxillary measurement but may beaffected by the temperature of re-cently consumed fluids or the evap-orative effects of mouth breathingand tachypnea. Rectal temperaturelong has been accepted as the goldstandard of indirect measurement because there is less deviation by environmental factors.However, this technique often is uncomfortable for chil-dren and can be associated with cross-contamination ifstandard precautions are not followed rigorously. Over the past decade, infrared tympanic membrane thermometry has gained popularity because it is quick,comfortable, and cost effective and has few infectioncontrol issues. Because the blood supply of the tympanicmembrane is similar to that of the hypothalamus, themeasurement is believed to be closer to the core bodytemperature. Yet, despite numerous studies, the accuracyof tympanic thermometry remains debatable, especiallywhen there is difculty aiming the thermometer at thetympanic membrane, when there is cerumen impactionor otitis media, and when the clinician struggles with Figure. The febrile response.infectious diseases acute fever Pediatrics in Review Vol.30 No.1 January 2009 7properly positioning the thermometer in infants younger than 2 months of age. (8) It is important for the practi-tioner to appreciate that body temperatures vary: (9) [35.7\u00b0 to 37.5\u00b0C]) Therefore, it is best to use a consistent form of measure- ment and make the measurement at the same site tomonitor changes in body temperature. Although a measured temperature is preferred for reliability and accuracy, parents often bring a child forevaluation because the child \"feels warm to the touch.\"Parental assessment of fever, based on the tactile temper-ature of the child's skin, is subjective because it may varywith environmental factors as well as with the part of thebody the parent is touching. The sensitivity of this tech-nique when used by parents ranges from 71% to 89%, butthe specicity and positive predictive value are less than50%; the accuracy when used by medical staff is onlyslightly better. (10)(11) Therefore, parental report offever to touch has limited validity and is, perhaps, moreuseful to exclude, rather than conrm, the presence offever. Fever as a Predictor of Illness In most cases, fever is associated with an infectiousillness. The organism (eg, virus, bacteria) invades thehost and may seed various tissues and organs, causingfocal infection or sepsis. In response, host defense mech-anisms attempt to contain and eliminate the organism.The clinical and laboratory signs associated with infec-tion (eg, fever, increased white blood cell count, in-creased C-reactive protein) reflect the activity of the hostdefense system and, therefore, may be useful for moni-toring outcome. In this context, the presence of feversignies ongoing infection for most infectious illnesses;as the infection is contained, the fever usually begins toresolve. Thus, the presence or absence of fever is a veryuseful guide to the course of illness. Debate has surrounded whether the height of the fever is associated with increased morbidity and whetherit predicts more serious illness. As the body temperaturerises, there is an associated increase in heat stress becausephysiologically, children have higher metabolic rates andare more prone to radiant heat loss compared with adults. In addition to increased catabolism, there is anincrease in both heart rate (10 to 15 beats/min perdegree C) and respiratory rate (3 to 5 breaths/min perdegree C). Most healthy children can accommodate such stresses. However, children who may not be able tobuffer the increased metabolic demand (such as thosewho have a chronic illness, cardiovascular or pulmonarydisease, immature or suppressed immune systems, orunderlying anatomic abnormalities) are at risk for devel-oping more systemic effects. Furthermore, in the 2% to4% of children who develop febrile seizures, the height ofthe temperature has been shown to be an independentrisk factor for such seizures. (12) Still, brain damage, acommon concern of parents and practitioners, has notbeen shown to be caused by fever (even a temperature ashigh as 107.6\u00b0F [42\u00b0C]) associated with infection; it isthe underlying illness rather than the fever itself that isresponsible for most morbidity. (13) Similarly, the validity of the height of the fever as a predictor of serious illness remains unclear. Although thepresence of pneumococcal bacteremia, especially in thetoddler age group, has been shown to be related to theheight of the fever, the increased incidence is small.Furthermore, with the widespread use of conjugatedpneumococcal vaccination, this association may nolonger be germane for prognostic relevance. (14) Somestudies show that hyperpyrexia (temperature /H11022106.0\u00b0F [41.1\u00b0C]) is associated with a higher incidence of seriousillness, but no useful symptoms or screening laboratorytests (eg, white blood cell count) predict bacterial ratherthan viral infection. (14) However, almost all childrenwho have life-threatening illness in these studies hadpredisposing underlying medical conditions or were clin-ically assessed to be ill-appearing. (4)(14) Thus, clinicalappearance rather than the height of fever is a morepowerful predictor of serious illness. Accordingly, ratherthan focusing on the height of the fever, the clinicianshould use the overall impression of the child's clinicalstate determined by a thorough history and physicalexamination, in combination with the reliability of theparents and likelihood of good follow-up, to guide man-agement. Fever Without a Source and Prolonged Fever Most febrile illnesses last for fewer than 3 to 5 days.During this time, either a specic cause is identied andtreated or the fever resolves spontaneously. The initialtreatment of febrile children who do not have an identi-infectious diseases acute fever 8Pediatrics in Review Vol.30 No.1 January 2009able source of infection or localizing signs on physical examination has been a subject of much uncertainty overthe past decade. In some cases, fever remains an impor-tant sign for identifying children who need immediateevaluation and treatment. Although the majority havebenign, self-limited illness, those who have serious bac-terial illness often are difcult to diagnose and have highmorbidity. Children who have a specic chronic illness orimmunosuppressive conditions are at higher risk of de-veloping serious illness and sepsis. Because of this con-cern, some screening laboratory and radiologic studiesfrequently are recommended, and empiric antibioticsmay be advised. Similarly, the febrile infant younger than 2 months of age has immature immune responses and may not be ableto contain certain infections. In fact, as many as 10% offebrile infants in this age group have serious bacterialillness, including almost 3% who have bacteremia orbacterial meningitis. (15) Because infants younger than 1month of age have a high risk of bacteremia and have yetto develop many clinical signs (eg, social smile) necessaryto judge clinical appearance, most management strate-gies recommend routine hospitalization and empiric an-tibiotic treatment pending the results of blood, urine,and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. (15)(16) For infants 1 to 2 months of age, management often depends on risk stratication using the peripheral whiteblood cell count, urinalysis, and often cerebrospinal fluidstudies to determine if the febrile infant needs hospital-ization and empiric antibiotic treatment or if the childcan be treated as an outpatient with or without empiricantibiotics. Febrile illness is most common in the 3- to 36-month age group and usually is of relatively benign viral originthat needs no more than reassurance and careful follow-up. In other cases, the child has a recognizable bacterialsource of infection on physical examination and can betreated accordingly. Nevertheless, the identication of\"occult\" or unsuspected bacteremia in well-appearingfebrile toddlers prompted the development of variousmanagements designed to identify a subset of childrenmore likely to have bacteremia. Because some childrenwho have bacteremia subsequently develop serious bac-terial illness such as meningitis, many guidelines recom-mend empiric antibiotic treatment pending the result ofa blood culture. (16) However, a major change has occurred in both the incidence and epidemiology of occult bacteremia in thepast decade. In the early 1980s, about of well- , accounted for almost 75% of cases, usually resolved spontaneouslywithout antibiotics. On the other hand, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection had a 10% to 20% progression to meningitis. With the near eradication ofHib disease after immunization, the incidence of occultbacteremia has declined to about 1.5%. More recently,widespread use of the heptavalent pneumococcal vaccinehas had a profound impact on the risk of occult bactere-mia by reducing the incidence of pneumococcal bactere-mia to less than 0.2% and the overall incidence of bacte-remia to less than 0.7% in vaccinated children. (17)(18)At this low rate of bacteremia, the utility of routine bloodcultures and complete blood count is diminished in theevaluation of otherwise healthy, well-appearing, febrile3- to 36-month-old children who received pneu-mococcal vaccine. (17)(18)(19) However, the presenceof occult urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile childrenwho have no source of infection remains a concernbecause the prevalence ranges from 2.1% to 8.7%, beinghighest in girls younger than 1 year of age and lowest incircumcised boys older than 6 months of age. (20) Otherfactors that increase the likelihood of a UTI include priorUTIs, lack of circumcision, abdominal pain, back pain,dysuria, and suprapubic pain. (20) If a UTI is suspected,a catheterized urine specimen should be obtained todecrease the chance of a contaminated culture. The denition of fever of unknown origin (FUO) often was applied to any febrile illness that persisted at atemperature of at least 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C) for 3 or moreweeks. However, with the use of more sophisticateddiagnostic techniques, many investigators have short-ened the minimum duration of fever to 7 to 9 days withthe following caveats: fever is present every or almostevery day, and there have been repeated evaluations by aclinician that included a history, physical examination,and selected laboratory tests. It also is important todifferentiate true FUO from two separate shorter febrileillnesses that occur within a short time interval, giving thefalse impression of one longer febrile episode. Parents of a child who has FUO are often frustrated and anxious due to the prolonged nature of the fever andthe inability to nd the underlying cause. In an effort tomake a diagnosis, multiple laboratory and radiologicstudies often are obtained, which may be confusing tointerpret due to false-positive and false-negative results.Therefore, a focused approach, beginning with a historyand physical examination, is essential. Further investiga-tion should proceed stepwise, with consideration of theduration of the fever, age of the child, exposures, andclinical appearance. infectious diseases acute fever Pediatrics in Review Vol.30 No.1 January 2009 9In general, children who have FUO have lower mor- tality and more self-limited disease compared with adults.(21) Almost 50% of the cases of FUO are due to infec-tious diseases (usually respiratory infections, followed byinfections of the urinary tract, skeleton, and central ner-vous system). (21) The incidence of infectious causes(eg, tuberculosis, parasitic infection) also may vary withlocal epidemiology. Generally, as the duration of thefever increases, the cause is less likely to be infectious. Ofthe remaining cases of FUO, 10% to 20% are due torheumatologic diseases, 8% due to malignancy, and 10%to 20% remain undiagnosed. (22) Management of Fever As discussed, fever is just one of many nonspecic acute-phase responses to infection. Although fever may havesome benecial effects in terms of shortening the dura-tion of illness by creating an unfavorable host environ-ment for the infecting microbe, this effect usually isoutweighed by the associated increased metabolic de-mand and discomfort for the child. Parents should notfocus solely on the height of fever, but if the childbecomes uncomfortable or cannot be assessed clinically,fever should be treated. Because fever increases metabolic demand, its man- agement should begin with restoring the nutrients andwater lost during the onset of the febrile phase. This isaccomplished best by proper hydration as well as bycreating a comfortable environment by adjusting thechild's activity level and amount of clothing. Sponging orbathing with tepid water provides only marginal temper-ature reduction and often is accompanied by discomfortand shivering. Cold water or rubbing alcohol should notbe used because it leads to vasoconstriction rather than tothe vasodilatation that is needed for heat dissipation;alcohol also can be absorbed through the skin and lead totoxicity. For low-grade fever, nonpharmacologic meth-ods often are all that are needed. However, as the tem-perature increases, antipyretics frequently are required toreduce the body temperature and make the child morecomfortable during the illness. Antipyretic therapy is not,however, without potential disad-vantages, including the eliminationof fever as a valuable diagnosticclue, the occurrence of allergic oridiosyncratic reactions, the possibil-ity of toxicity when dosed incor-rectly, and the elimination of fever'seffects on the immune system. The most common antipyretics, acetaminophen and nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), work by inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase, which converts arachidonicacid to prostaglandin. Although the interleukin-mediated steps of the febrile response continue to in-crease the hypothalamic set point, the effects of thereduced production and release of prostaglandin work tooverride that response. Thus, antipyretics serve to lowerthe set point. This effect is present only in the febrilestate; antipyretics do not reduce normal body tempera-ture. Both the efcacy of the type of antipyretic used and whether the antipyretics should be used in combinationhave been debated. Acetaminophen has a long history ofboth safety and efcacy in doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg.Multiple preparations are available, and most forms arepalatable, are well tolerated, and cause few allergic reac-tions. Ibuprofen is the most common NSAID used as anantipyretic. The recommended dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg ispalatable, efcacious, and safe, despite theoretical con-cerns about interstitial nephritis, when used for a limitedtime as an antipyretic in children older than 6 months ofage. Both drugs are absorbed in the GI tract, metabo-lized in the liver, and excreted in the urine. Table 1compares their pharmacodynamics. A review of severalstudies comparing acetaminophen and ibuprofenshowed similar safety and analgesic effects for moderateand severe pain, but ibuprofen was a more effectiveantipyretic and provided a longer duration of antipyresis.(25) The use of a combination of acetaminophen and ibuprofen, in a variety of alternating regimens, has be-come a popular practice of both parents and practitio-ners. When surveyed, 67% of parents responded that theyalternated antipyretics, (26) and 50% of pediatriciansadvocated such practice. (27) Yet, no conclusive proofindicates that alternating antipyretics is either safe ormore efcacious than single-drug therapy. The onlystudy that suggested an advantage of alternating therapyused subtherapeutic doses of antipyretics and inappropri-ate dosing intervals in the monotherapy groups.(23)(26) Furthermore, Table 1.

Specically, ibupro-fen inhibits production of glutathione that, in the pres-ence of increased acetaminophen concentrations, canlead to hepatic or renal toxicity, especially in a febrilechild who has hypovolemia. (27)(28) Therefore, in theabsence of additional data, parents should be cautionedabout using this approach; rather, practitioners shouldreinforce monotherapy with the correct antipyretic dos-age and dosing interval for the individual child. The response of fever to antipyretic therapy should not be used as a prognostic factor for determiningwhether the child has a less serious illness. Several pro-spective studies suggest that fevers due to serious infec-tion (such as bacteremia) are as responsive to antipyretictherapy as less serious infection and, therefore, do notdistinguish between infectious outcomes. (29) However,because it often is difcult to assess the febrile child dueto the discomfort associated with fever, the reduction offever may allow better assessment of the child's underly-ing well-being. A child who has a serious illness oftencontinues to look ill even after fever reduction, whereasthe appearance of a child whose illness is benign usuallyimproves. Vigorous attention to antipyretic therapy has been advocated for children who have a history of a simplefebrile seizure. Yet, in the few controlled studies to date,no reduction in the recurrence of febrile seizures wasdocumented with antipyretic therapy. (29) Therefore, itis more appropriate to focus on the excellent long-termoutcome of febrile seizures to reduce parental anxiety,rather than on undue attention to fever control. Parental Beliefs and Fever Phobia As many as 30% of acute-care visits in pediatrics arerelated to the complaint of fever. Many of these visits aredue to parental confusion about the signicance of feverand the resultant anxiety about potential harmful effectsof fever. These mistaken beliefs and undue concernsabout fever were described in the early 1980s by Schmitt,(13) when he coined the term \"fever phobia\" to describeexcessive concern by parents about low-grade fever. Thisphenomenon has been replicated in several studies, con-rming that many parents remain confused or misin-formed about what is normal temperature, what tem-perature constitutes a fever, how a temperature shouldbe taken, and the use and dosing of antipyretics.(13)(30) Concern about brain damage, febrile seizures, and death from mild-to-moderate fever exists across the spec-trum of parental education and socioeconomic status. (30) In a sense, most parents still view fever as a \"disease\"rather than a \"symptom.\" This perspective may be due,in part, to practitioners who may present mixed messagesto parents about fever and fail to address parental con-cerns about fever during all types of pediatric visits. (3)Parents may be taught to \"control\" the fever rather thanunderstand fever as a sign of an underlying illness thatwill persist until the illness is resolved. These misconceptions by parents and practitioners have potential for a negative psychosocial impact on thephysician-parent-child relationship during the evaluationof a simple febrile illness. Parents who are very worriedabout fever are more likely to perceive their doctors asbeing very worried about fever, more likely to bring thechild for medical evaluation, and more likely to haveblood tests performed on their children. (2) Whether theincreased testing is due to parental pressure or practitio-ner anxiety is not known, but the result is that the parentmay believe that blood tests are necessary for the evalu-ation of fever. This misperception leads to more feverphobia, more medical evaluations for febrile illness, moretesting, and perpetuation of the anxiety. The same situation holds true for the use of antibiotics for the febrile child. Almost 50% of pediatricians sur-veyed said parents always, most of the time, or oftenpressure them to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics, andabout 33% of the pediatricians comply with these re-quests occasionally or more frequently. (31) Parents mayperceive that the treatment for fever is antibiotics ratherthan antipyretics. Thus, practitioners must be diligent intheir efforts to counteract fever phobia (Table 2) andresist the pressure and temptation to perform unneces-sary testing and prescribe unnecessary antibiotics.

Therefore, a reduction in the height ofthe temperature after antipyretic therapy does notdistinguish between infectious causes. However,clinical experience indicates that a child who has aserious illness often continues to appear ill afterfever is reduced, whereas the appearance of a childwho has a benign illness usually improves.
