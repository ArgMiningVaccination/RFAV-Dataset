Pursu- ant to the order of the House of Janu-ary 4, 2007, the Chair will now recog-nize Members from lists submitted by the majority and minority leaders for morning hour debates. The Chair will alternate recognition between the par-ties, with each party limited to not to exceed 30 minutes, and each Member, except the majority leader, the minor-ity leader, or the minority whip, lim-ited to not to exceed 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. W ELLER ) for 5 min- utes. f DEMOCRAT TAX INCREASES IN OUR FUTURE Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, this week the House is going to be taking up the budget and there is nothing more basic in the fundamental process of being a legislator than the budget. What is written in the budget says a lot. In fact, the budget is really a defining difference when you put for-ward your budget. The Democratic leadership is plan- ning to bring their partisan Demo-cratic budget to the floor. Again when you get down to basics, the differences are pretty clear because what is in the Democrat leadership's budget that they are bringing to the floor today is the biggest tax increase in the history of our Nation. Think about that. Can we really afford to tax the middle class more. In their first order of business in the 110th Congress, the Democrats made it easier to raise taxes. When Republicans were in the majority, we said you couldn't raise taxes unless you had a two-thirds vote. The Democrats elimi-nated that because they wanted to make it easier to raise taxes. They have eliminated that rule. They have shown their agenda before. Back when the Democrats were in the majority back when President Clinton called for a big tax increase, the Demo-crats followed and they rubber-stamped a tax increase at that time, which was the biggest tax increase in the history of our Nation, a $240 billion tax in-crease on the American people. Just this past week, the Democrats outdid themselves. In fact, they brought an even bigger tax increase to the floor that we are going to debate this week. It was $240 billion 13 years ago, today it is a $400 billion tax in-crease. They plan to raise the tax on every taxpayer; man, woman, child, married, if you die, you are going to pay more in taxes under the Democrat budget. In fact, if you are a typical couple in the district I represent making $60,000 a year, mom, dad and two kids, you will pay on average $2,000 more in high-er taxes. That is a 60 percent increase in higher taxes called for in the Demo-crat budget. In 2001 and 2003, Republicans worked with the President. We worked to eliminate unfairness in the Tax Code. We worked to lower taxes for the mid-dle class. We succeeded in 2001 and 2003 in reducing taxes for a typical Amer-ican family. And again, for a family making about $60,000 a year, those tax cuts meant about $2,000 more in higher take-home pay. That is money they can spend on their own needs. In my home State of Illinois, 4.2 mil- lion taxpayers benefited from the cre-ation of a new, lower tax bracket. We lowered taxes for everyone, but for lower income Americans, we created a 10 percent tax bracket. Today, 5 mil-lion Americans no longer pay Federal taxes because of that new tax bracket; and 1.4 million taxpayers benefited from our efforts to eliminate the mar-riage tax penalty. We increased the child tax credit benefiting 1.3 million Illinoisans. We also passed into law my legisla- tion which eliminated the marriage tax penalty. I stood on this floor day after day after day and I asked a pretty fun-damental question: Is it right, is it fair that our Tax Code punishes the most basic institution in our society, which is marriage. And in 2001 we passed the Marriage Tax Elimination Act. That was our third try. Twice we passed the Marriage Tax Elimination Act, elimi-nating the marriage tax penalty, a tax on marriage and President Clinton ve-toed that twice. President Bush signed it into law. But today, millions of couples, in fact 24 million married working cou-ples no longer pay the marriage tax penalty thanks to that legislation being signed into law. Unfortunately, the Democrats want to bring the mar-riage tax penalty back. In fact, you will hear some this week say ''they are probably rich'' because if they pay the marriage tax penalty, they must be rich. Well, under their legislation this week, 23 million typical married cou-ples in America will see their taxes go up just from the marriage tax penalty alone of almost $500 more in higher taxes just because they are married. Is that right? Is that fair? We worked to benefit all taxpayers by lowering taxes in 2001 and 2003. Now VerDate Aug 31 2005 00:31 Mar 28, \u2014 HOUSE H3084 March 27, 2007 the Democrats, they want to come back and they want to raise taxes on all taxpayers, including reinstating the marriage tax penalty. f COMMENDING MATHEMATICAL BREAKTHROUGH The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the order of the House of Janu-ary 4, 2007, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. M CNERNEY ) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 min-utes. Mr. M CNERNEY. Madam Speaker, the American Institute of Mathe-matics, MIT, Cornell University, Uni-versity of Michigan, University of Utah, and the University of Maryland together created a mathematical breakthrough this week made possible by congressional support of the Na-tional Science Foundation. The breakthrough involves defining the detailed structure of a geometric object called E8, the largest of the ex-ceptional Lie groups used to study symmetry. E8, one of the most com-plicated structures ever studied, is a 248-dimensional Lie group used to ex-plore the symmetries of a 57-dimen-sional object. Mapping out such an ob-ject is a magnificent achievement of the human mind. Connections between E8 and string theory indicate that physical applica-tions of E8 will eventually emerge. The participants are to be com- mended for their work that has ex-panded the limits of human knowledge and brings hitherto unknown beauty and power to grace our human condi-tion. f GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the order of the House of Janu-ary 4, 2007, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. S TEARNS ) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes. Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, last week the Energy and Commerce Com-mittee marked up H.R. 493, Genetic In-formation Nondiscrimination Act. Two other committees of jurisdiction have also voted on this same bill. Many people have been remarking that we have been working for over a dozen years on this particular piece of legislation and this subject. I count myself among them because in 1995 I was proud to be named the first chair of the Congressional Task Force on Medical Records and Genetics by then- Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley. Indeed, in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) markup, I was successful in adding two words to a list of protec-tions: ''Genetic information, '' which is in the HIPAA law today. I have continued my engagement, au- thoring bills in the last several Con-gresses to prohibit genetic non-discrimination in health insurance. While I agree conceptually with the in-tent, this particular piece of legisla- tion I have mentioned earlier, gives rise to many concerns. First, I can support legislation which would surgically target what people are fearing: They worry about being ex-cluded or charged a higher rate from a health insurance agent or fired or not hired in the first place by an employer because of predictive, speculative ge-netic information that in no way ex-hibits in their current health status. However, with the wording ''request or require, '' which is in the bill, this bill goes beyond that to cast a shadow upon any use of genetic information by a health plan or physician. This bill should ban misuse of genetic informa-tion, but not impede the flow of infor-mation between provider, patient and plan. Let's not stifle health services, phar- macies, health records services, health counseling or health education. I think we should not fear beneficial, patient- friendly medical opportunities. We should harness those, while drawing a tighter box around the misuses that are feared. Ban misuses, not ban all uses. Secondly, I am troubled by the rath- er murky, broad definitions in this leg-islation. In particular, by the defini-tions of ''genetic test '' and ''genetic in- formation. '' This legislation does not clarify that information regarding cur-rent health status is not exempted by the bill 's prohibition. For example, the mere fact that someone has an O or AB blood type, also detects that person has the O or AB genotype, which under the definition of this bill is a genetic test. This bill could ensnare the most rou-tine lab test of a health exam: A blood panel to check for heart, kidney or liver functioning. And beyond health applications, at the Health Subcommittee March 13 hearing, Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Human Genome Research Institute, acceded as much. When Ranking Member N ATHAN DEAL ques- tioned him if this bill, GINA, covers certain tests, Dr. Collins answered: ''To the extent that those tests are con-ducted in a way that conducts genotypes, mutations, or chromosomal changes, they would qualify as a ge-netic test. '' These include forensic DNA identification tests, tests for organ donors to match organ tissues, paternity tests, and tests to select safer and more effective drugs based on your genetic profile. For example, if the bill means to sweep in genetic tests performed on cancer tumors, it will prevent tests such as Her 2 genetic tests given to women with breast can-cer, designed to determine if their tu-mors are responsive to drug therapy. Such therapy is both risky and very costly for patients without such a spe-cific gene marker. In the employment setting, this bill muddies what an employer will be able to do in a worker 's compensation or oc- cupational substance abuse situation; very important. Currently, an em-ployer has the right, in fact, the legal responsibility, to conduct drug tests in the name of public safety for cause, and to examine medical records in a work comp case to determine the na-ture of an injury. If a blood test, there-fore a genetic test, is included in the medical record, a hapless employer could have an unintentional disclosure on their hands. Finally, it is unclear if this legisla- tion will preempt or create an unwork-able patchwork with the nearly 40 States ' genetic bans. Most have a bright line distinction between ''current health'' versus ''genetic'', and exclud-ing paternity and forensic uses. Florida's law does. And, the author of the legislation, Rep-resentative S LAUGHTER , did herself include current health wording in prior versions of her legislation. Genetic information is personal, powerful, permanent, and sensitive. Let us continue to work to make this bill a tool for protecting Americans against ill uses of their genetic pro-file, while not impeding the flow of information, routine employment activity, and the delivery of health care. f RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o 'clock and 45 minutes a.m.), the House stood in re-cess until noon. f b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order at noon. f PRAYER The Reverend Roy Smith, Arkansas Conference of the United Methodist Church, Little Rock, Arkansas, offered the following prayer: Our holy and gracious God, we are grateful to be here in this place today. These Representatives have been en-trusted by the citizens of this country to govern our Nation. In the midst of a world of rapid change, of challenge, of diversity and need, this is a solemn and daunting task. It is an extraordinary responsibility and challenge which calls for courage and conviction, integ-rity and honor, understanding and compassion, intelligence and commit-ment. As these Members of Congress gather today to do the important work before them, O God, in Your grace draw near. Send us Your compassion, Your cour-age, Your wisdom, Your strength and Your understanding. May the will and work of this House be carried out so the people of this land may live in free-dom and hope and share in your boun-tiful blessings. May our Nation be a beacon of freedom and hope in the world today. We pray in Your holy name. Amen. VerDate Aug 31 2005 03:38 Mar 28, H3085 March 27, 2007 THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam- ined the Journal of the last day 's pro- ceedings and announces to the House her approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour- nal stands approved. f PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. M CHENRY ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. M CHENRY led the Pledge of Alle- giance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f WELCOMING THE REVEREND ROY SMITH (Mr. ROSS asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Reverend Roy P. Smith of Little Rock, Arkansas. I first met Roy in 1992 when he moved to my hometown of Prescott, Arkansas, to lead the church that my family and I belong to, the First United Methodist Church of Prescott. During his 3 years in my hometown, Roy was my pastor, my spiritual adviser, and a leader in our community. By the time Roy, along with his wife Sandy, daughter Martha Helen and son Andrew left Prescott to move on to their next as-signment up the road in Malvern, Ar-kansas, Roy had become one of my closest and most trusted personal friends. My family and the Smith family will be forever linked together by a strong and lasting bond of friendship, and it is a distinct pleasure to have Reverend Roy Smith here today to open this leg-islative day in the United States House of Representatives with his thoughtful and meaningful words of prayer. As we go about doing the work of the people, may we remember the prayer Reverend Roy Smith delivered on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives this day. f THE BUDGET (Mr. M CHENRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. M CHENRY. Mr. Speaker, the Democrats are setting some records this week, but these are not landmarks we should be proud of. In fact, it won 't make the Democrats famous, but it will most certainly make them infa-mous. The Democrats are poised to pass a $392 billion tax increase on this House floor, the largest tax increase in Amer-ican history. Rewind to 1993, the last time the Democrats had control of this House Chamber, and what did they do? They proposed the largest tax increase in American history. They 're one-up- ping their own history. It's amazing, Mr. Speaker. That means 115 million Americans will see taxes increased on average by $1,795. This isn 't chump change. It 's real money to the American people. And why do Democrats feel they 're entitled to this money? Because that 's what they do. They 're Democrats. They tax. They spend. It 's not a new idea. They 've been at it for 70 years. If it weren 't so infuriating, it would just simply be so sad. f IRAN (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. KUCINICH. The President 's threat of the use of military force against Iran is an impeachable offense. When our Commander in Chief says all options are on the table, it is unmis-takable. That means a military strike, even the use of nuclear weapons. In-stead of inviting calamity upon him-self, our Nation and the world, Presi-dent Bush should reopen serious diplo-matic negotiations with Iran to de-es-calate tensions and resolve all issues, including Iran 's use of nuclear power. We must reject the idea that war is inevitable and that war is diplomacy by another means and work to remove the barriers of misunderstanding be-tween Iran and the U.S. and Iran and the region. Instead of making statements or passing resolutions which sets the stage for conflict with Iran, Members of Congress should convene to seek a way to avert military conflict with Iran. I will be contacting my colleagues to discuss how we can create a course of action which creates peace through in-tegrating Iran with the world commu-nity and addresses all issues which are at the core of the conflict. f BARBECUE KILLER (Mr. POE asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Tynesha Stewart, a 19-year-old freshman at Texas A&M, was looking forward to spring break and coming home to Houston to visit with her mother. There was one problem with coming home, however. Her possessive ex-boy-friend Timothy Shepherd would not leave her alone. Tynesha knew that he would contact her, even though she had repeatedly told him she wanted to move on. He and his male ego refused to accept this. On March 15, Tynesha made one final attempt to cut the ties with this har-asser. She told him that she was seeing someone else and that it was over. Shepherd decided if he could not have her, no one would, and he strangled this young college student. This was not the end of his barbaric acts. He needed to get rid of her body, so he dismembered Tynesha and then he barbecued her on his apartment patio grill. The burning of her body took 2 full days. Shepherd did all this to the person he claimed he loved. Timothy Shepherd has been charged with murder for his grisly crimes. The people of Texas will properly decide what to do with this barbecue killer. Love is not harassment, control, or abuse. You never hurt someone you claim you love. And if you do, woe to you, because justice will rule the day. And that 's just the way it is. f DEMOCRATIC BUDGET IS BAL- ANCED WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS AND INVESTS IN OUR CHILDREN (Ms. SOLIS asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, a budget is a blueprint of a party 's values. This week, Democrats will bring a budget to the House floor that cares for our chil-dren and our families without raising taxes. For the first time in 6 years, we have an opportunity to pass a budget that actually finds balance in the next 5 years, something that Republicans never did while they controlled the House and something the President continues to refuse to do. We want to get our fiscal house in order so that our children are not forced to pay off our debts decades from now. At the same time we are paying down our debt, we also invest in our children, making sure they have access to qual-ity health care and to quality edu-cation. The Democratic budget substantially increases the S -CHIP program, which will allow our States to insure millions of children who are now uninsured. In California, it is known as the Healthy Families program. We also provide $7.9 billion over the President 's budget for education funding, which includes No Child Left Behind, special education and helping students better afford col-lege. Mr. Speaker, the Democratic budget values our children and puts them first while investing in our country. f THE FEDERAL BUDGET (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Right now, taxpayers in south central Michigan are making tough choices every day to ensure their family budgets are balanced. They do so by cutting spending and having fis-cal discipline. It 's time we make these same commonsense choices on a Fed-eral level. This week in the House, we will begin debating a budget plan for the fiscal year 2008. A budget proposal introduced by my colleagues on the opposite side VerDate Aug 31 2005 03:38 Mar 28, H3086 March 27, 2007 of the aisle would impose the largest tax increase in American history, near-ly $400 billion over the next 5 years. Their plan would institute a $3,000 tax increase for every typical Michigander and put off needed entitlement reform for at least another 5 years. Congress needs to pass a balanced budget bill without raising taxes. We need to make tax relief permanent for hardworking American families and re-form unsustainable entitlements. The American people long for a Congress that puts our fiscal house in order on a Federal level, but they want this done without expanding the size and scope of the Federal Government. I urge my colleagues to oppose any budget plan that proposes a ''spend now, reform later '' mentality. f PRESIDENT REFUSES TO CHANGE COURSE AND CALLS HOUSE AC-TION POLITICAL THEATER (Mr. COHEN asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, last week the Democratic House delivered on its promise to move the Iraq war in a new direction. We approved a very serious piece of legislation that includes the recommendations of the President, the nonpartisan Iraq Study Group and the Pentagon. The President responded to our action by describing it as political theater and threatening a Presidential veto. How can this be political theater if we are putting some real teeth into the benchmarks that the President himself established for the Iraqi government earlier this year? Let 's not forget the President 's own words: ''I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq 's other leaders that America 's commit- ment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people, '' said President Bush. Those were his words. This legislation passed last week puts in law the President 's demands that the Iraqis meet his benchmarks. You would think the President would support such action. Instead, he calls it political theater. So much for holding the Iraqi government accountable. The President should reconsider his veto threat. It could be the theater of the absurd. f HOUSE OVERSIGHT OF BUSH AD- MINISTRATION IS LEADING TO RESULTS IN THE U.S. ATTOR-NEYS SCANDAL (Mr. SIRES asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, they say when you have bad news, get it out on Friday night. That 's exactly what hap- pened last Friday when the Justice De-partment released documents indi-cating that Attorney General Gonzales led a meeting of top aides to discuss the firing of U.S. Attorneys. This docu- ment completely contradicts the At-torney General 's own statement that he did not participate in any discussion and only had cursory knowledge of the U.S. Attorney dismissals. The Attorney General 's contradic- tions were followed yesterday by a Jus-tice Department official taking the fifth and refusing to testify. This is un-acceptable, particularly after Gonzales himself said that all Justice Depart-ment officials would be made available to Congress. The administration needs to make Justice Department and White House officials available to Congress so that we can continue to provide oversight. This Congress will continue to ask tough questions so that we may ensure U.S. Attorneys are free from political pressure. f THE DEMOCRATIC BUDGET (Mr. D EFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. D EFAZIO. George Bush and the Republicans have spent our country to the verge of bankruptcy. They have doubled our foreign debt. They have in-creased our national debt by 60 per-cent. George Bush has accumulated more debt than every President who preceded him in the United States of America and they have done it on the credit card. And guess who is going to get the bill in their world after they eliminate taxes for the wealthy? It 's going to be the middle class, and they 're going to get hit twice. They 're going to get the bill, and their kids and grandkids are going to get the bill. And the programs that middle-income Americans need like tuition assistance for their kids to go to college, the Bushies cut those. That 's their sense of fiscal responsi- bility. The other side over here, the gen- tleman from North Carolina is saying, oh, the largest tax increase in history. No. We 're allowing the tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, people who earn over $250,000 a year, people who have estates worth more than $5 mil-lion, we 're asking that once again they pay their fair share. There will not be a penny increase on middle-income families. They can make up anything they want, but it 's not true. But, yes, the wealthy would pay a lit- tle bit more. That 's why they 're squealing so much, because the Repub-licans get their money from the wealthy to try and maintain control of our country. f b1215 SALUTE TO CORPORAL FLETCHER (Mrs. CAPITO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, ''hero'' is not a label that should be employed carelessly, and in a time when our country has many heroes serving abroad, I rise today to honor a hero at home: Corporal Ronald Fletcher. A member of the Jefferson County Sheriffs Department, Corporal Fletcher was pursuing a burglary suspect into a home last month when he was shot twice in the chest and once in the arm. At only 26 years old, he lay seriously wounded in the house with the suspect until his fellow deputies were able to remove him safely. Today, just one short month after the incident, I am proud to share that Corporal Fletcher is home and well on his way to recovery. As a testimony to his profound sense of duty, he recently complained about being bored in his home full of fruit baskets and is eager to return to service. Mr. Speaker, I salute the heroism of Corporal Fletcher and the valor of the Jefferson County Sheriffs Department. West Virginia is sincerely grateful for their service. f RESTORING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, for too long, many of America 's toughest chal- lenges have gone unaddressed while massive debt was piled on the backs of our young generations. Now, this Democratic-led House has proposed a budget that takes our Na-tion in a new direction and reaches bal-ance in 5 years while lowering the def-icit. By contrast, the President 's pro- posed budget does not achieve balance at all, despite his promises to do so. The House budget also puts in place pay-as-you-go spending principles, fi-nally requiring our government to bal-ance and prioritize spending the way all American families must do. Restor-ing fiscal integrity is not only good for the budget 's bottom line, but it is also important in protecting our national security, since much of our Nation 's debt is owed to foreign governments. Mr. Speaker, the Democratic budget resolution begins the process of restor-ing fiscal integrity to the leftover Re-publican mess of reckless spending and massive deficits. It is time for a bal-anced budget that meets the needs of American families without mortgaging our future to foreign interests. f DEMOCRATS ' MANY ACCOMPLISH- MENTS IN 110TH CONGRESS (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, over the last 3 months, this new Demo-cratic House has paved the way for a new direction in America. During the first 100 hours, we passed legislation increasing the minimum VerDate Aug 31 2005 00:31 Mar 28, H3087 March 27, 2007 wage, giving the Federal Government the ability to negotiate cheaper pre-scription drug prices, making college more affordable by cutting interest rates in half on student loans, and fully implementing the 9/11 Commission 's recommendations. We have provided valuable oversight of the Bush administration 's failings at both the Justice Department and at Walter Reed Hospital. Had we not con-ducted oversight hearings of the hor- rendous conditions at Walter Reed, sev-eral incompetent administration offi-cials would still be on the job. Then, last week, we approved an emergency supplemental spending bill that provides critical funding for our soldiers and our veterans while holding the Iraqi Government accountable for taking control of Iraq. And this week, we will pass a budget which is balanced within the next 5 years. Mr. Speaker, the American people asked for a change and a new direction, and this Congress is delivering. f STRYKER BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM (Mr. CARNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to salute the Pennsylvania Na-tional Guard, in particular the Stryker Brigade Combat Team. Fielding the Stryker Brigade has been the largest program undertaken by the Pennsyl-vania National Guard in modern his-tory. The Stryker Brigade Combat Team is a combat force that provides division, corps, or joint task force commanders a unique capability across the full range of operations. On this upcoming district work pe- riod, I will be visiting Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, to have an oppor-tunity to tour their Stryker program. The Stryker is a survivable and sus-tainable method of troop transpor-tation. It can take soldiers safely into a range of environments, from war to humanitarian assistance. We must do everything we can to defend our troops from harm, and the Stryker provides that protection. Pennsylvania has the largest Army National Guard in the United States, with the 28th Infantry Division being the premier division with a large num-ber of soldiers in a high state of readi-ness. I commend the Stryker Brigade Com- bat Team and the entire Pennsylvania National Guard for their fine service to our country and representing Pennsyl-vania with honor. f IRAQ BENCHMARKS (Mr. BRALEY of Iowa asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, when hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money is being spent on a war overseas, it is important there be benchmarks and consequences if they are not met. Last week the House approved an emergency war supplemental that will finally hold the Iraqi Government ac-countable by measuring its perform-ance on standards that President Bush himself outlined earlier this year. Under the plan passed here last week, the President must report to Congress this summer on the progress the Iraqi Government has made on these key benchmarks. If the Iraqi Government lives up to its promises, our troops will remain there until next year. If, how-ever, they do not meet the President 's own benchmarks by this summer, we will begin to redeploy our troops out of Iraq immediately. This accountability is particularly critical after the release of a Defense Department report show-ing that the Iraqi Government is not close to meeting any of these bench-marks. Mr. Speaker, it is time that the Iraqi Government realizes that the Amer-ican troops are not going to be in Iraq indefinitely, and that they have to begin seriously taking responsibility for their own nation. f PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 835, HAWAIIAN HOME-OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Com-mittee on Rules, I call up House Reso-lution 269 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. R ES. 269 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 835) to reauthorize the programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for housing assist-ance for Native Hawaiians. All points of order against the bill and its consideration are waived except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The bill shall be consid-ered as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final pas-sage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and con-trolled by the chairman and ranking minor-ity member of the Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions. S EC. 2. During consideration of H.R. 835 pursuant to this resolution, notwithstanding the operation of the previous question, the Chair may postpone further consideration of the bill to such time as may be designated by the Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BUTTERFIELD ). The gentleman from Florida (Mr. H ASTINGS ) is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. For pur- poses of debate only, I yield the cus-tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S ESSIONS ). All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have up to 5 legislative days to revise and extend their re-marks on House Resolution 269. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 269 provides for consideration of H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Oppor-tunity Act of 2007, a closed rule pro-viding 1 hour of general debate in the House, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. The rule waives all points of order against the bill and against its consid-eration except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the bill shall be considered as read. Fi-nally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to speak very long about this legislation other than to express my sincere hope that this body will move forward expedi-tiously with its passage. As my colleagues know, the Hawai- ian Homeownership Opportunity Act was placed on the Suspension Calendar last week after being unanimously voted out of the Committee on Finan-cial Services by a voice vote. It was our hope, and the hope of so many Native Hawaiians, that the House would sup-port it with as much enthusiasm as did the committee of jurisdiction. Unfortunately, as we all now know, there are some in this body who believe that it is in their best interest to cre-ate a partisan divide where no such di-vision should exist. They have in my opinion falsely accused my friends and representatives from Hawaii of ulterior motives, and in doing so, have delayed justice and fairness to some of our most loyal citizens. Contrary to the false accusation made by its opponents, this bill is not a bill aimed at achieving Native Amer-ican status for Native Hawaiians, no matter how important that issue may be. This bill provides low-income Native Hawaiians access to the American Dream. They, just like all of us in this body, have had at one point in our lives a dream to own a home. This bill brings them one step closer to realizing that dream. Shame on those who continue to paint this bill as anything other than what it is. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation which is so critically needed. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in opposition to this closed rule and the potentially uncon-stitutional measure that the Democrat VerDate Aug 31 2005 00:31 Mar 28, H3088 March 27, 2007 majority is presently bringing before the House. I also rise in opposition to the major- ity's gaming of the system by bringing this legislation up under a closed rule with no input from the minority, even after this measure failed to win the support of two-thirds of the House when it was considered under the sus-pension of the rules just last week. I believe that the 162 ''no'' votes that were cast last Wednesday prove that this measure carries with it some measure of controversy. I have heard the gentleman from Florida explain very clearly and carefully in addressing this issue his desire for us to under-stand that in fact nothing more other than the words that are on the paper are intended and implied in this bill. However, I would say there is also room to make sure that is not only correct, but also to improve this legis-lation. I am also confident that an over- whelming number of Members would likely support the final measure if they were given a chance to improve it through the amendment that perhaps we are hearing that the majority in-tended perhaps in the first place or at least did not unintend to make it hap-pen. Unfortunately, in what is becoming a standard practice for the Rules Com-mittee, last night the Democrat major-ity rejected along party line the only amendment offered to this legislation that would have offered the solution on behalf of the 162 ''no'' votes. This amendment was offered by the gen-tleman from Texas (Mr. N EUGEBAUER ) who simply would have made it clear that there is nothing in this legislation that should be constructed to confer a special relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people for the purpose of establishing a government-to-government relation-ship. This amendment is necessary because in 2000 the Supreme Court decided in Rice v. Cayetano that the current con-figuration of Justices would likely strike down most Federal benefits flowing to Native Hawaiians as an un-constitutional racial set-aside if, given a chance, by accepting Mr. N EUGEBAUER 's amendment, or at least allowing its merits to be debated and voted on, Congress would have had the opportunity to make it crystal clear to any future court that this legislation should not be construed as Congress ' abuse of its power under the Indian commerce clause to indirectly confer tribal status on the Native Hawaiian people. I will take the words that have been given to me by the gentleman from Ha-waii (Mr. A BERCROMBIE ) as well as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. H ASTINGS ) from the Rules Committee that they do not intend this legislation in any way, and it should not be construed as told to the minority, that they would in-tend to pass power under the Indian commerce clause to indirectly confer tribal status on the Native Hawaiian people. I will take them at their word as the understanding and the basis and the intent of this legislation. But by shutting out this amendment, the Democrat majority has done noth-ing to address the concerns of the 162 Members of this body who do believe that this legislation under consider-ation is vague at best and unconstitu-tional at worst. b1230 Nor have they done anything to clar- ify the intent of this legislation to the courts. While, Mr. Speaker, you and I recognize that courts in their delibera-tions would look at congressional in-tent, we would like for it to be so stat-ed. While the majority has indicated they do not intend this, we wish it had also been in the form of an amendment. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that, once again, the majority has silenced the minority in this effort. I am dis-appointed also that, by failing to in-clude this amendment, Congress may very well be opening up this legislation to be overturned by the courts. In doing so, Congress would be depriving Native Hawaiians access to the loan guarantee programs provided for in this bill simply for the sake of speed at the cost of accuracy and good legisla-tion. I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule so that this legislation can be passed in a clear, constitutional way that makes it transparent to the courts that this is not a back-door attempt to lay the groundwork for other legisla-tion to confer tribal status on the Na-tive Hawaiian people. Native Hawai-ians are just as much a part of Amer-ica, this great land, as any of us. Their history is covered by the Constitution, and they are part of this country. I op-pose this rule and the underlying legis-lation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. I would notify the gentleman from Florida I have no additional speakers. If he would engage with me in a quick colloquy, we can figure out where we are in terms of moving forward. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I will be the last speaker on my side. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time until the gentleman has closed for his side and has yielded back his time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I do ap- preciate the gentleman from Florida, his conduct on the Rules Committee, him working with the minority on a number of bills. We wish we could have been successful on this amendment, just the one amendment to add into this piece of legislation. We will take them at their word that they do not intend for this to be any sort of a back-door attempt to form a government-to-government relation-ship with the tribal Native Hawaiians. I will tell you that we do believe that public housing and housing for Hawai-ians, who are many times faced with increasing not only land costs but prices that escalate in the beautiful, beautiful State of Hawaii, that this is a good idea. We should be helping these people out. We simply wish that the amendment had been made in order for the proper clarification. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time. I appreciate very much my friend 's attitude with reference to this matter and his suggestion that he would ac-cept the representation of our two col-leagues from Hawaii as well as me and other members of the Rules Com-mittee. I would also urge that your concerns, albeit, I believe, likely to be taken care of on another day, have been addressed by the committee that reported this out unanimously, meaning the Repub-licans and the Democrats on the rel-evant committee voted this matter out. I would also urge that the Hawaiian State legislature has indicated that there are no intentions at all to seek any special status; and the Governor of Hawaii, who is a Republican also, has made it clear that no special status is sought. Toward that end, it would seem to me that this matter, having been sup-ported, had the enjoyment of the sup-port of 262 Members last week, and that is a total that I hope we will reach today, because this legislation is des-perately needed. This is an issue of fairness and access. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this appropriate rule and the underlying legislation and to clearly understand that it has noth-ing to do with citizenship and every-thing to do with housing. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question are post-poned. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to whether or not my friend from Texas is going to manage all the time on this rule. Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the gen- tleman 's inquiry. At this time, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. L INCOLN DIAZ-BALART ) is intended to represent the minority on the Rules Committee. He is not here at VerDate Aug 31 2005 00:31 Mar 28, H3089 March 27, 2007 this time. So until further notice or until his arrival, it would be my intent to have the gentleman accept me in his stead. f PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1401, RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Com-mittee on Rules, I call up House Reso-lution 270 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. R ES. 270 Resolved, That at any time after the adop- tion of this resolution the Speaker may, pur-suant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 1401) to im-prove the security of railroads, public trans-portation, and over-the-road buses in the United States, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consider-ation of the bill are waived except those aris-ing under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour and 20 minutes, with one hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland Security and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and In-frastructure. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall be in order to con-sider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute rec-ommended by the Committee on Homeland Security now printed in the bill. The com-mittee amendment in the nature of a sub-stitute shall be considered as read. All points of order against the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute are waived ex-cept those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. Notwithstanding clause 11 of rule XVIII, no amendment to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accom-panying this resolution. Each such amend-ment may be offered only in the order print-ed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally di-vided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amend-ment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such amendments are waived except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a sepa-rate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without in-structions. S EC. 2. During consideration in the House of H.R. 1401 pursuant to this resolution, not-withstanding the operation of the previous question, the Chair may postpone further consideration of the bill to such time as may be designated by the Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Florida (Mr. H ASTINGS ) is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague and co-Chair of Flor-ida's congressional delegation, Mr. L IN- COLN DIAZ-BALART , or his designee, my friend from Texas (Mr. S ESSIONS ). All time yielded during consideration of this rule is for debate only. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have up to 5 legisla-tive days to revise and extend their re-marks on House Resolution 270. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 270 provides for consideration of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour 20 minutes of gen-eral debate. One hour is to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland Security and 20 minutes equally divided and con-trolled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, ex-cept those arising under clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the amend- ment in the nature of a substitute rec-ommended by the Committee on Home-land Security shall be considered as an original bill for purposes of amendment and shall be considered as read. The rule waives all points of order against the bill. Importantly, the rule makes in order the eight amendments printed in the report accompanying this rule and waives all points of order against such amendments. The amendments may be offered only in the order printed in the report and by the Member designated in the report or his or her designee. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to commence debate on this very essential piece of legisla-tion. Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of September 11. While we in this body have done a great deal of talking about Homeland Security, our record on the issue sug-gests otherwise. Under Republican control, the major- ity maintained that mandating certain security enhancements was not nec-essary at the time. Democrats, on the contrary, believe that they are and will not allow this need to go unmet any longer. The fact that this bill was reported favorably out of the Homeland Secu-rity and Transportation and Infra-structure Committees with near una-nimity and the cosponsorship of the ranking Republican member of the Homeland Security Committee sug-gests that our concerns are almost uni-versal in this body. Moreover, this rule makes in order a total of eight amendments, half of which will be offered by the Members of the minority party. The rule and the process further prove that Democrats refuse to allow partisanship to super-sede our responsibility to protect the American people. Congress 's prior reluctance to man- date certain security enhancements out of fear that it might rock the ad-ministration 's boat has left us woefully behind the curve when it comes to rail and mass transit security. That is why I am very pleased that the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act makes the necessary investment in these absolutely critical enhance-ments. The bill requires that the administra- tion develop a security plan for all forms of covered transportation. The bill also creates a system and methods under which all agencies tasked with the responsibility of protecting our country can work together. We don 't stop there. The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to expand its coordination network through enhanced communication and cooperation at all levels of govern-ment. It requires DHS to develop security training programs for railroad and pub-lic transportation employees and ex-tends whistleblower protections to all providers, public or private, who pro-vide covered transportation services. Under this bill, the number of surface transportation security inspectors will increase by six times by the year 2010, and the bill mandates that the admin-istration issue regulations requiring enhanced security measures for the shipment of security sensitive mate-rials and requires that these shipments not go through highly populated areas. b1245 Perhaps most importantly, this bill pays for these improvements and au-thorizes $7.3 billion in security en-hancements to make America safer. Mr. Speaker, the Government Ac- countability Office has determined that the United States must provide much more leadership and guidance in constructing a rail and security transit plan. This bill answers that challenge and fills the void left by the adminis-tration 's failure to secure all modes of transportation in this country. It, just like the rule, is worthy of the support of this body. I urge my col-leagues to support both. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to VerDate Aug 31 2005 00:31 Mar 28, H3090 March 27, 2007 thank my good friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. H ASTINGS ), for the time. I yield myself such time as I may consume. At about 9 a.m. on July 5, 2005, three bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other in the London underground. Less than an hour later there was an-other explosion in one of London 's dou- ble-decker buses. The bombings killed over 50 people and injured approxi-mately 700. On March 11, 2004, the Spanish people also faced an attack on their rail sys-tem. Like the attacks in London, in that attack the terrorists exploded multiple bombs on four trains packed with early morning commuters. The attacks killed almost 200 and left at least 1,800 injured in Madrid. Mr. Speaker, those attacks were a warning to us on this side of the Atlan-tic that just as terrorists can take ad-vantage of our airlines to carry out cowardly acts, they can do the same with our public service transportation systems. With this in mind, the House of Representatives last year passed comprehensive rail and mass transit security legislation. The legislation was included in H.R. 5814, the Depart-ment of Homeland Security Authoriza-tion Act for Fiscal Year 2007. Unfortu-nately, the session of Congress ended before that important legislation could be enacted into law. Public transit moves more people on a given day than any other mode of transportation worldwide. Transit sus-tains the economic vitality of any community. In heavily populated areas like Miami-Dade County, one of the counties that I am honored to rep-resent, many people depend on public transit for cost efficiency and conven-ience. The provision of safe transit re-quires a significant investment in tech-nology to protect infrastructure, equip-ment, workers and, of course, the pas-senger. H.R. 1401 makes it possible for Congress to invest in public transpor-tation security. And in my district, Miami-Dade Transit is also responsible for the evac-uation of the general public, including disabled persons, in moments of crisis. This bill provides critical funding for evacuation improvements. Miami-Dade County would be eligible for funds, re-gardless of whether the evacuation is due to terrorism or natural disasters. Although Miami-Dade Transit has a fleet of over 360 paratransit vehicles and over 1,000 buses and approximately 45 miles of rail, they do not have mo-bile communication service equipment. This means that all modes do not have a way to communicate with each other during an evacuation procedure. This bill takes into account those needs and provides for security improvements to stations ' surveillance equipment, pub- lic awareness campaigns, and GPS sys-tems. I would like to point out, Mr. Speak- er, that this bill includes risk-based grants. In their final report to Con-gress, the 9/11 Commission criticized the existing process for allocation of Federal homeland security assistance grants, recommending that the dis-tribution not, I quote, ''remain a pro- gram for general revenue sharing. '' Given the limited resources of Federal aid, distributing grants based on risk is really the only appropriate way to ap-portion grants. In order to ensure that our taxpayer funds are spent as effi-ciently and effectively as possible, we need to focus our resources at those sectors under the greatest threat. When I was a member of the Select Committee on Homeland Security, I worked hard to ensure that Homeland Security grant funds are distributed through risk-based assessments. I com-mend the Homeland Security Com-mittee for following through on the recommendation of the 9/11 Commis-sion and including risk as the primary motive for distribution of grants in this legislation. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met to report out a rule for this legislation. The rule that we are now debating closes out several impor-tant and germane amendments. Two amendments by my friend, Mr. M ICA, the ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, were excluded by the majority on the Rules Committee, even though they were germane and, obviously, from a key committee with jurisdiction. An-other of my Florida colleagues, Rep-resentative G INNY BROWN -WAITE, of- fered an amendment last night that would have strengthened protections for all sensitive security information related to rail and mass transit plans and procedures. That amendment also was blocked by the majority on the Rules Committee. I think it was unnec-essary and unfortunate for the major-ity in the Committee on Rules to con-tinue to close the legislative process in the 110th Congress. Mr. Speaker, one thing, an additional point I would like to make, I would like to point out to my colleagues that the majority is now including in this section 2 language which allows the Speaker to postpone consideration of the bill at any time in every rule. It is including that language now in every rule. It is interesting, since this is a struc- tured rule, which means that the bill will be considered in the Committee of the Whole. This is very precedent-set-ting because in previous Congresses this language has never been included on structured rules. It is typically only included on a closed rule or a modified closed rule where the bill is being con-sidered in the House and not in the Committee of the Whole. And in pre-vious Congresses it was only included when debate was scheduled to last more than the traditional 1 hour in the House. So I find this strange, because when the House is in the Committee of the Whole, it can simply rise and post-pone consideration. I find it curious as to why the new majority is extending this authority now to all rules, even when it doesn 't seem necessary. Could it be that the majority is intending to quash the minority 's lone procedural guarantee, the motion to recommit? I am afraid that that may be exactly what it amounts to, Mr. Speaker, be-cause there is no other procedural ex-cuse for this language being included in a structured rule. It is not necessary for the Speaker to have this authority unless they want to postpone consider-ation just prior to the vote on the mo-tion to recommit. This is just another example, Mr. Speaker, of the seemingly small, yet significant, precedents that the new Democratic majority is set-ting, creating new ways to silence the voice of the minority. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. And I would say to my friend from Florida that, in his concerns about the motion to recommit and the time to see it, I am sure my friend is mindful that when a motion to recommit comes to the House floor that it comes without the Members of the House having had an opportunity to know the substance of the motion to recommit. I might add, that period of time, par- ticularly in the last 2 months, we have seen that when the minority has pre-sented the motion to recommit, that what winds up happening is even Mem-bers of the minority don 't know what is in the motion to recommit. There-fore, it seems more than reasonable that a sufficient amount of time be given for that purpose. And I also think in the interest of fairness that we have been considerably fair in ac-cepting more motions to recommit than have our friends in the minority. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, yielding myself such time as I may consume before yielding to my good friend from New York, it is important to note when, again, seemingly small but significant precedents are changed. This is a prece-dent change. We have not seen it for many, many years. With regard to the motions to recommit, what we have seen in this Congress is that they often have been passing. But that is more precisely because the membership, when finding out the merits of the mo-tions to recommit on a bipartisan basis have been supporting them. But, no, it is of concern, and it is im- portant to note that if there is a step being taken, as it seems that it is being taken, to limit that very important, often sole procedural remedy available to the minority which is the motion to recommit, that it is very disturbing. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished friend from New York (Mr. K ING). Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for yielding. And I stand here today, first, to commend the chairman of the full committee, Mr. T HOMPSON , for the bi- partisanship he has shown, the level of VerDate Aug 31 2005 00:31 Mar 28, H3091 March 27, 2007 cooperation he has demonstrated in bringing this bill through the com-mittee process and to the House floor today. This was work that was begun in the last Congress, and now it has been brought to its fruition, and I com-mend the gentleman for that. As Mr. D IAZ-BALART indicated, there were serious rail attacks in Britain in 2005, in Spain in 2004 and, of course, in India. And there is no doubt that ter-rorists certainly would be considering to use rail and transit as a base for fu-ture attacks here in this country. So this legislation is needed. It is con-structive and on balance, it is very positive. For instance, it authorized the use of VIPER teams. It does base funding on threat and risk. And it ad-dresses very, very key areas of vulner-ability. Having said that, I wish the same spirit of bipartisanship that had pre-vailed at the committee level had pre-vailed in the Rules Committee, because there are a number of amendments which were not ruled in order. In fact, there was no amendment ruled in order which was offered by a member of the Homeland Security Committee, specifi-cally, an amendment by Mr. D ANIEL E. LUNGREN , which would have, I believe, addressed deficiencies in the whistle-blower language which would have pro-tected classified national security in-formation. The amendment by Ms. G INNY BROWN -WAITE, who will be speaking on it herself in a few moments, would have certainly prevented the disclosure of sensitive security information on Freedom of Information requests, and two amendments by Mr. D ENTas far as screening travelers entering the U.S. and interdicting terrorists at the bor-der. All four of these amendments would have been very constructive. I supported them strongly. At the very least, they deserved a full debate here on the House floor today. So for that reason I will oppose the rule. Having said that, I do support the un- derlying legislation, and I do commend Chairman T HOMPSON for his efforts and certainly subcommittee ranking mem-ber and former chairman, Mr. D ANIEL E. L UNGREN , for the efforts that he put into this in the previous Congress. This is legislation whose time has come. Unfortunately, it was not al-lowed the opportunity to even be bet-ter than it is. So having said, while I support the underlying legislation, I must reluc-tantly oppose the rule today. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to a distinguished member of the Rules Committee, my good friend from Ohio (Ms. S UTTON ). Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from the Rules Com-mittee for yielding time on this very, very important issue. Today is a great day, and I rise in support of the rule and the underlying resolution in this matter to improve our security on our rail and busway systems throughout this country. b1300 When I was running for this office, this was a very, very important and significant issue to many people who I represent throughout Northeast Ohio. We have many passengers and others who utilize these services who, unfor-tunately, despite evidence of vulner-ability and potential attack, have been exposed to the ongoing danger of our failure to secure these systems. I also am proud to see that in this bill we have protections for whistleblowers that will improve the likelihood of se-cure and safe transit systems within our country. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, at this time it is my pleasure and privilege to yield 4 minutes to my distinguished friend and colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. D ENT). Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, early in this session the majority promised to im-plement all the 9/11 Commission rec-ommendations. Yesterday, the Rules Committee, which is controlled by the majority, had the opportunity to de-liver on that promise by making two of my amendments to this legislation in order. It failed to do so, and the secu-rity of our rail and bus passengers and, in fact, our border security in general will be all the worse as a result. The 9/11 Commission advised the President to direct the Department of Homeland Security to ''design a com- prehensive screening system '' that would target ''particular, identifiable suspects or indicators of risk '' and give border officials ''the resources to estab- lish that people are who they say they are, intercept identifiable suspects, and disrupt terrorist operations. '' They concluded that targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon against ter-rorists as targeting their money. That is the 9/11 Commission report, rec-ommendation 14, page 385. And it rec-ommended that a terrorist travel intel-ligence collection and analysis pro-gram, which had ''produced dispropor- tionately useful results, '' should be ex- panded. The first of these amendments in- volved the Advance Passenger Informa-tion System, or APIS as we commonly refer to it. Today, under this program, air and sea carriers collect passenger and crew biographical data and trans-mit this data to Customs and Border Protection while the vessel or aircraft is en route to the United States. This is an important tool in CBP 's efforts to identify suspect or high-risk pas-sengers before, that is before, they enter the country. As terrorists are just as capable of taking a Greyhound bus across border as they are landing at LAX, I thought that my amendment, which would have required bus and train companies transporting passengers into this coun-try to provide the same advanced infor-mation to CBP as do the airlines, made sense. Unfortunately, the majority members in the Rules Committee did not agree. My second amendment would have authorized the deployment of the Auto-mated Targeting System For Pas-sengers, or ATS -P as we refer to it. ATS-P is an intranet-based enforce- ment and decision support tool that is the cornerstone of all of CBP 's tar- geting efforts at the border. ATS-P coordinates passenger infor- mation and forms an intelligence as-sessment of a traveler. ATS -P then makes a simple ''yes'' or ''no'' deter- mination on whether that inter-national traveler should be flagged for additional screening. Once this infor-mation is received by CBP officials, these officials retain the discretion to act, or not to act, on that information. In short, ATS -P is nothing more than a tool that can help CBP determine who might be a person worthy of a follow- up interview. Again, since we are already using this technology to screen international incoming flights, why not apply it to border crossings of trains and buses, other forms of transportation through which terrorists might try to enter the country? Why not? That was the gist of my amendment. Once more, however, the majority on the Rules Committee shot us down. Together, APIS and the ATS -P make up the building blocks of exactly the kind of border security program rec-ommended by the 9/11 Commission, and yet this rule prohibits our consider-ation of these two programs as part of our mass transit and rail security structure. The majority can talk the talk when it comes to adopting the 9/11 Commission recommendations, but by failing to implement these two amend-ments, it has shown that it cannot walk the walk. Accordingly, while I know that this legislation, H.R. 1401, will do many good things, and I do support the un-derlying bill, I ask that you vote against this rule because it fails to ad-dress the homeland security concerns detailed in my amendments. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 3 minutes to our distinguished colleague from Florida (Ms. G INNY BROWN -WAITE). Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Flor- ida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen-tleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi- tion to the rule for H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. This rule is overly restrictive be- cause it prohibits several good amend-ments like my colleague just enumer-ated as well as an amendment that I had tried to get in the bill. I think it is shocking because members are the most knowledgeable about this bill, having worked on it for weeks now, our members of the committee. One of the amendments that the rule excludes was the rule that basically said if we have an assessment out there VerDate Aug 31 2005 00:31 Mar 28, H3092 March 27, 2007 of perhaps a lack of security or an area that we need additional resources in, this information is going to become public. Think about what the terrorists would do. The amendment would have filled this security gap by exempting all sensitive information from Freedom of Information Act requests. It directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue regulations that would prohibit unauthorized disclosure of sensitive in-formation such as security plans, vul-nerability assessments, and risk-based criteria. Mr. Speaker, the International Asso- ciation of Fire Chiefs recently wrote a letter supporting my amendment, and I will include that letter in the R ECORD . INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OFFIRECHIEFS , Fairfax, VA, March 12, 2007. Hon. G INNY BROWN -WAITE, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D EAR REPRESENTATIVE BROWN -WAITE: On behalf of the nearly 13,000 chief fire and emergency officers of the International As-sociation of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like to voice our support for your amendment to the ''Rail and Public Transportation Secu- rity Act of 2007 '' that would protect sensitive information about our nation 's rail and pub- lic transportation sector. We share your concerns about protecting sensitive information from accidental public disclosure. Both the vulnerability plans and the security assessments described in this legislation contain sensitive information, such as threats to our nation 's transpor- tation system, security weaknesses, and re-dundant and back-up systems. It is impor-tant that this information be shared with the appropriate fire and emergency services, and law enforcement organizations to ensure that they are prepared for the accidental or deliberate release of hazardous materials. However, this information should not be made public, because of the serious problems that could occur if information about weak-nesses in the security of our nation 's trans- portation system fell into the wrong hands. Thank you again for offering this amend- ment. If you have any questions about the IAPC 's role in the safe transportation of haz- ardous materials, please feel free to call Ken LaSala, the Director of Government Rela-tions. Sincerely, J AMES B. H ARMES , President. I would also like to quote two sen- tences from the letter by those who would be the first responders, the Asso-ciation of Fire Chiefs, and the fire chiefs in your local district: ''It is im- portant that this information be shared with appropriate fire and emer-gency services and law enforcement or-ganizations to ensure that they are prepared for the accidental or delib-erate release of hazardous materials. However, this information should not be made public because of the serious problems that could occur if informa-tion about weaknesses in the security of our Nation 's transportation system fell into the wrong hands. '' Mr. Speaker, they said it far better than I could, and they would clearly be the first responders. By excluding these important amendments, we are short-changing the people of America with a bill that is filled with loopholes. I ask Members to vote ''no'' on the previous question and on the rule so we can go back and make some of these very appropriate amendments in order. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to my good friend from Mis-sissippi (Mr. T HOMPSON ), the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. I am also grateful to the Rules Com-mittee and my colleague from Florida for offering this rule. The bill passed out of the Committee on Homeland Security was a com-prehensive bill. I know a number of my colleagues offered amendments, and I appreciate their interest. I am also pleased the rule makes in order the manager 's amendment I will be offering. This amendment was the result of extensive negotiations with my colleagues on the Oversight and Government Reform as well as Trans-portation Committees. Chairman W AX- MAN assisted in perfecting the whistle- blower protections in the bill. Chair-man O BERSTAR worked with me on clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security in this bill. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I feel this is a good rule. It provides for sufficient debate on this important legislation. It also rules in order several amendments that deserve discussion and consider-ation by the House. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, at this time it is my privilege to yield 4 minutes to a distinguished new Member who is already making an impact in this House with his forceful leadership and his knowledge and wis-dom, Mr. B ILIRAKIS . Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule but in support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Pub-lic Transportation Security Act, which will improve the security of our Na-tion's rail, subway, and bus systems. I am very disappointed that this rule does not allow any Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee to offer amendments, of which there were sev-eral. Two of my committee colleagues, Congressman D ANIEL E. L UNGREN and Congresswoman G INNY BROWN -WAITE, have critically important amendments that would significantly improve this bill. However, I am pleased to support this bill, which my Homeland Security Committee approved unanimously. I support this bill because it will provide much-needed protections and security improvements for the millions of Americans that travel on our Nation 's buses, our subway system, and our train system. The Rail and Public Transportation Security Act will require Federal offi-cials and transportation providers to assess our vulnerability to terrorist at-tacks against these public transpor- tation systems and determine ways to improve their security. I am especially pleased that the bill we are considering today includes two proposals that I made during com-mittee consideration of this measure that I believe will strengthen our secu-rity against terrorist attacks on rail and mass transportation systems. First, the committee adopted an amendment I offered that requires DHS to conduct physical testing of railcars to determine the most likely successful means of attack against them. This is important because no real-world vul-nerability testing has been done on the safety of tank cars carrying dangerous toxic-by-inhalation hazardous mate-rials. My amendment remedies that by requiring such tests so that we can properly assess their current vulnerabilities and protect them to the most practical extent possible. My proposal also requires real-world plume modeling analysis for such at-tacks to help fill the current gaps in our understanding of these vulnerabilities so that we can better protect our constituents and first re-sponders from attacks on tank cars carrying dangerous materials and miti-gate their consequences. Second, this bill incorporates the text of an amendment that I filed dur-ing the committee 's consideration of H.R. 1401 that requires the security co-ordinator positions required under sec-tion 103 of the bill to be filled by U.S. citizens, a requirement which I think makes sense for several reasons. U.S. citizenship is required for individuals seeking security clearances for access to classified information and mate-rials. I very strongly believe that indi-viduals who will be responsible for co-ordinating and implementing security plans for our Nation 's rail and public transportation systems should be able to access, when appropriate, informa-tion to help them do their jobs as effec-tively as possible. I think it just makes sense to put American citizens in charge of the se-curity for our country. As we saw dur-ing the Dubai Ports debacle, many of our constituents demanded that Ameri-cans be in charge of America 's secu- rity, a position with which I hope we can all agree. I want to thank full committee Chairman B ENNIE THOMPSON , Ranking Member P ETER KING, Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee Chairwoman S HEILA JACKSON -LEE, and subcommittee Rank- ing Member D ANLUNGREN for their hard work and open-mindedness in crafting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, we have rightly focused much of our time, attention, and re-sources on securing our Nation 's avia- tion system in the years since 9/11. I believe it is time that we focus on se-curing our country 's public transpor- tation systems, which so many of our constituents use each day. VerDate Aug 31 2005 01:11 Mar 28, March 27, 2007 b1315 This bill is a significant step in that direction. I urge our colleagues to sup-port this bill. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 4 minutes to my good friend, the distin-guished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE), the chairwoman of the Transportation Security and Infra-structure Protection Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to address you this afternoon. I thank my good friend Mr. H ASTINGS from Florida, and let me thank the Rules Committee for the thoughtful and constructive rule that has been put forward and acknowledge my colleague on the subcommittee, Mr. B ILIRAKIS , for his comments about the underlying bill. Just to inform my colleagues, this is a bill long overdue, and procedurally I believe that we moved this bill in reg-ular order. We held two hearings. First of all, a hearing that allowed us to hear from the vastness of government agen-cies, who, I guess out of their testi-mony, one could argue that they made a very clear case that we needed a reg-ulatory framework within which to se-cure the Nation 's railroads and transit systems. Obviously, through the tragedies of London and Madrid, we knew that the clock was ticking; and this committee, under the chairmanship of Chairman T HOMPSON , knows that we must ad- vance the ball, building on the work that this committee has done as a bi-partisan committee over the years with a number of chairpersons, that we must move the ball forward to ensure the security of the Nation 's homeland. That means this particular sub- committee will address questions deal-ing with not only the questions of rail, but of aviation, of bus, of trucking, and as well critical infrastructure that heretofore may not have been assessed as closely as we should have. So we held one hearing. At a second hearing we were able to hear from a number of industry persons to tell us, again, of some of the mountains that they had to climb in order to ensure se-curity of the homeland. That being so, this is a comprehen- sive bill. I am delighted it includes lan-guage regarding research and training, whistleblower language that comports with the Waxman legislation, so we are consistent in the legislative structure. I support, as well, the manager 's amendment by Mr. T HOMPSON , which focuses on some aspects that I think help the bill. There will be some issues that I hope that we can move further along, and that is a relationship of consultation between the Homeland Security De-partment and the Department of Transportation. As relates to security, I think it is key that the Department of Homeland Security and the Homeland Security Committee lead in consultation with a number of our jurisdictional allies. I want to thank the chairman of the transportation committee and the chairperson of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Congresswoman C ORRINE BROWN . We worked very collegially to- gether, and I think this is a strong product. Might I also just indicate that I hope my colleagues will pay close attention to language that would eliminate Am-trak from security grants. One of the largest modes of passenger transpor-tation, which has had its ups and downs, sometimes the passenger rate is up, sometimes it is down, but it does not mean that it is not a vulnerable target. It is interesting that if you run your transit system 24 hours a day, for ex-ample, there has to be a period where there is low passenger census. Does that mean that it is any less a target to threats than it would be during peak times? So I hope my colleagues will consider the vulnerability that the Ses-sions amendment gives to this whole bill and the idea of securing exten-sively the rail system. Might I suggest that amendments that would undermine the Transpor-tation Security Administration breed-ing program increase also pose con-cern, because, as we know, we have not yet had a system in rail travel that ad-dresses the question of security of bag-gage. So this breeding program, dealing with domestic animals, is an important aspect of dealing with the question of security. I would also suggest that you don 't want to leave out the provision that we have in the over-the-road bus program, and that should not be eliminated. This is a good rule. I ask my col- leagues to support it, and I hope they will support the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the his- tory of this bill. This bill was badly needed be-cause, as you know, the issue of transpor-tation security has been over looked. This bill authorizes more than 5 billion dollars over the next four years for rail, public transportation, and over-the-road bus security. Having seen the horrific events in Madrid and London, something must be done to improve transpor-tation security. We know that this bill moves in that direction because we 've had a long and distinguished legislative record resulting in this bipartisan bill. As the Chairwoman for the Homeland Secu- rity's Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection we have held two hearings on the topic of transportation secu-rity. On February 6, the Subcommittee re-ceived testimony from the government on transportation security. On February 13, the Subcommittee heard testimony from industry and labor about the issue as well. Both of these hearings were attended by the Sub-committee 's Ranking Member, Mr. L UNGREN from California, and other Committee Mem-bers from both parties. In these hearings, the Subcommittee heard from over nine different witnesses. The wit-nesses included, Assistant Secretary Hawley, with the Transportation Security Administra-tion, two witnesses from the Department of Transportation, one from the Federal Railroad Administration, and the other from the Federal Transit Administration, and the Government Accountability Office 's rail security expert. We also heard from the Amtrak 's Inspector Gen- eral, the Association of American Railroads, and the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Finally, we also heard from the Transport Workers Union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. As such, I think we have heard from all the stakeholders impacted by this bill. Besides hearings, the Subcommittee held a mark-up on March 1, 2007, in which there were ten amendments offered and discussed. These amendments dealt with issues, includ-ing whistleblower rights, reducing protections for protecting sensitive information, and oth-ers. I believe the mark-up yielded a strong bill, which was made even stronger by the Full Committee 's mark-up and its consideration of more than twenty amendments. Mr. Speaker, because the Homeland Secu- rity bill was passed unanimously out of Com-mittee and it represents a compromise be-tween the Transportation & Infrastructure and Oversight and Government Reform Commit-tees, and is a great step forward to protecting our transportation systems, I urge my col-leagues to support the Rule. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 2 minutes to our distinguished colleague from California, Mr. L UN- GREN . Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. I thank the gentleman for yield-ing. Mr. Speaker, this is a good day in some respects, and that is that we have this bill on the floor, H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. It follows up on work that we began in the last Congress on a bi-partisan basis. I would say the committee acted on a bipartisan basis all the way through. It is a shame, however, that bipartisan-ship stops at the edge of the Rules Committee. When we made an attempt to ask for reasonable amendments in this regard from members of the com-mittee of jurisdiction, the Homeland Security Committee, we were rejected. I might just talk about the one amendment that I had asked to be con-sidered dealing with whistleblower pro-tection. The bill has in it now a provi-sion which is extraordinary in its breadth and which is unique in its ap-plication of criminal law. People won-der why we would be concerned about this when we all agree we ought to allow whistleblowers, when acting properly, to expose wrongdoing. The problem is we are in an area dealing with security, and this would allow an employee to make an individ-ualized determination, without further review or even perhaps without all the relevant information, to disclose clas-sified information. We ought to be con-cerned about that. My amendment would have dealt with that. For some reason now in the man- ager's amendment we are going to ex- empt these criminal penalties for many Federal employees, but we are going to VerDate Aug 31 2005 01:11 Mar 28, H3094 March 27, 2007 impose them on State and local em- ployees, criminal penalties and puni-tive damage awards. So we are going to have a situation in terms of sensitive information that might be revealed by an employee and therefore action taken against that employee, and the government unable to respond to that, because under this whistleblower pro-tection law, there will not be the abil-ity for the government to talk about protecting basically state secrets. What we are talking about here are areas of sensitive information. This goes along with the gentlewoman from Florida 's amendment to try and pro- tect sensitive information. Both of those amendments were rejected. I would hope that Members would vote down this rule so we might have a chance to do our job and at the same time protect sensitive information. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M ICA), one such distinguished Member who had two germane amendments be-fore the Rules Committee that were shut out. He is the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I do rise in opposition to this rule. I have been here for 15 years, and this is probably one of the most egregious efforts to deny committees of jurisdic-tion input into this very important leg-islation. We just heard from Mr. L UNGREN , a very distinguished Member and rank-ing member on the Homeland Security Committee. He stated again the par-tisan nature of the Rules decision. The Chair on the Republican side, the rank-ing member of that committee, Mr. K ING, indicated that there were zero amendments. Unprecedented. On the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, there were zero amend-ments accepted. So I must strongly encourage that we vote against this rule. Again, in my ex-perience, I have never heard of such an egregious abuse of minority rights or participation in the process. Most importantly, I think that one of the amendments that we offered from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, while the manager 's amendment does have some improve-ments in taking these important secu-rity grants from DHS, which has had difficulty in managing all their respon-sibilities, and we have the money going through DHS and the grants adminis-tered by the Department of Transpor-tation, which is an improvement, it has been my experience that it is not how much money you spend, it is how you spend it. We had an amendment that offered a vast improvement, which was to conduct a needs and risk assessment on security risks relating to transit and rail, which has never been con-ducted. So we are going to take $6 billion of hard-earned taxpayer money and put it through this system that I just de-scribed and not really address that money to the real threats and risks that we face. I don 't think that is wise. This weekend I spent some time in Pennsylvania. I went through a couple of towns and I saw a lot of people. I saw some tough towns in some of the rural areas traveling up there. But I saw a lot of people going to work and work-ing hard, sending their money to Wash-ington. They are counting on us to be good stewards of that money and to spend that money. Our number one responsibility is the safety and security of those people, and here we are abandoning that responsi-bility. So they work very hard out there to send that money here and now see it not properly applied. That is wrong, and I will oppose this rule. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Rule, H. Res. 270, for the consideration of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Se-curity Act of 2007. I strongly support effective security meas- ures for America 's railroads, transit systems, and intercity buses. But the funding authorization levels in the bill that will be brought up today are based on a phony estimate of the surface transportation security needs. The $6 billion authorized in H.R. 1401 is based on a 2003 member survey conducted by the American Public Transportation Asso-ciation. There was no discipline to the APTA sur- vey\u2014anyone could ask for anything they thought they might need at any time. Yesterday, I offered two amendments to the Rules Committee, both of which were rejected on a straight party-line vote. The first amendment was simply a require- ment that DHS and DOT determine what the security needs of the Nation 's transit systems and railroads are before authorizing $6 billion in grants. This amendment was supported by the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastruc-ture. Yet the Rules Committee refused to allow the amendment to be considered. I also proposed an amendment to expand the current whistleblower protection law for both the safety and security of railroad em-ployees under the Railway Labor Act. This effective whistleblower protection law in title 49 of the U.S. Code has been in place since 1970. This law covers the reporting of all hazardous conditions, whether related to safe-ty or security. Under the Railway Labor Act whistleblower protection, railroad employees are fully pro-tected against termination, harassment or dis-crimination. There is absolutely no good reason to re- place this functional and effective law with new whistleblower protection requirements under the Department of Labor. Don 't fix it if it isn 't broken. But this amendment, despite support from both the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation and In-frastructure, was also rejected by the Rules Committee on a party-line vote. I strongly oppose this Rule. The bill development was not bipartisan, and it is obvious that the development of the Rule was completely partisan. The Democrat-led Congress 's unwillingness to work with Republicans on this bill flies in the face of Speaker P ELOSI 's commitment to work in an open and bipartisan manner. It's a shame that this Congress has put poli- tics ahead of effective security for the traveling public. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we are going to oppose the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, I will amend the rule to make in order two amendments Mr. D ENTof Pennsylvania offered last night at the Rules Committee. Mr. D ENT, a member of the Homeland Secu- rity Committee, testified on behalf of his amendments, but the Democratic majority of the Rules Committee all voted against making these important amendments in order. These amendments would establish a screening program for individuals who are arriving at or departing from the U.S. through covered transportation, namely, by passenger rail and bus. His amendments would also require car-riers who provide transportation to people entering the U.S. to provide pas-senger information to Customs and Border Protection. Mr. D ENT's amendments would imple- ment one of the key 9/11 Commission recommendations, which stated: ''In- formation systems able to detect po-tential terrorist indicators should be used at primary border inspection lines, in immigration services offices, and in intelligence and enforcement units. '' During the recent campaign, the Democrats pledged to enact all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. By not allowing Mr. D ENT's amendments, they are ignoring a loophole for the terrorists to exploit and are reneging on a promise they made to the Amer-ican people to protect them. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con- sent to insert in the R ECORD a copy of the amendment and extraneous mate-rial immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I listened with great intensity to my friend from Florida regarding the resources that the American public provides to the United States Govern-ment for its distribution. He seems to decry the fact that this year we are going to spend $7 billion on rail secu-rity. My ultimate question would be, What did you spend on rail security last year, the year before, the year be-fore and the year before that? Somewhere along the line, I believe that the American people want us to VerDate Aug 31 2005 03:38 Mar 28, H3095 March 27, 2007 make sure that our rail system and our bus system are as secure as we can make them. This is a start in that di-rection. I also heard my friend from Orlando say that the rule itself is the most egregious that he has seen in 15 years. Well, I have been here every one of those 15 years that he has been here, and if he wants to see egregious, then travel with me back to the 4 years in the minority that I was on the Rules Committee, and I will show you egre-giousness. b1330 Mr. Speaker, the 9/11 Commission gave the Transportation Security Ad-ministration a C-minus for its efforts to develop a security strategy for all modes of transportation. GAO, as I pre-viously mentioned, has said that the U.S. has failed to provide the appro-priate leadership in enhancing all forms of covered transportation. Something needs to change. This bill provides the necessary leadership and funding to move us forward. For too long, Congress has neglected its responsibility to do whatever is nec-essary to protect the well-being of the American people. This is a fair rule. It gives four amendments to the minority and four amendments to the majority; hardly as egregious as the many times no amendments were granted to the minority when Democrats were in the minority. I urge my colleagues to support both the substantive legislation and this rule. Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I strongly sup- port the Rail and Public Transportation Secu-rity Act (H.R. 1401). Our country needs this bill. Our communities need this bill. This legislation is very timely for my district. On March 15th, a train trestle burned down just outside central Sacramento. The fire sent a dark plume of smoke into the sky. The residents of our region received quite a scare. Children were kept inside because au-thorities could not determine if the smoke from the trestle fire was toxic. Fortunately, no one was hurt. The incident is not being investigated as a terrorist attack. However, this fire showcased the impact that our rail vulnerabilities can have on com-munities. In Sacramento, our train tracks form a ring around our most populated areas. If the trestle had caught fire just a few miles down the track, houses would have burned. If the train had exploded, or if it had leaked hazardous material, my constituents could have died. I cannot let that happen. That is why this legislation is so important. It makes critical ad-vancements in rail security policy. I am grateful that Representative M ARKEY has addressed the transport of hazardous ma-terials through heavily populated areas. As the situation in Sacramento dem- onstrated, we must begin to reroute hazardous shipments to avoid populated areas. When possible, we must integrate new tech- nologies to secure these shipments. I look for-ward to working with Mr. M ARKEY to implement this proposal. It is also important to note that more people than ever are using public transit. Over 10 bil-lion trips were taken on public transportation last year. There has been a 30 percent in-crease in public transit use in the last decade. This increased ridership is great news. How- ever, it is important that we invest in security funding to match growing demand. This legis-lation will do just that. Finally, I want to commend Chairman B ENNIE THOMPSON of the Homeland Security Committee for his leadership on this issue. As a member of the Transportation and In- frastructure Committee, I have seen how smoothly Chairman O BERSTAR and Chairman THOMPSON have collaborated. They have done a great job dealing with the jurisdictional issues raised by transit security. Their work demonstrates the level of com- mitment that is needed to secure our commu-nities. Such collaboration is a refreshing change. It should serve as an example for us all as we tackle other pressing issues facing the 110th Congress. I urge my colleagues to support the Rule, so that we can enact this important legislation. The material previously referred to by Mr. L INCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida is as follows: AMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 270 OFFERED BY REP. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART OF FLORIDA At the end of the resolution, add the fol- lowing: SEC. 3. Notwithstanding any other provi- sion of this resolution, the amendments printed in sections 4 and 5 shall be in order as though printed as the last two amend-ments in the report of the Committee on Rules if offered by Representative Dent of Pennsylvania or his designee. Such amend-ments shall each be separately debatable for 30 minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. S EC. 4. The first amendment referred to in section 3 is as follows: At the end of title I of the bill, add the fol- lowing new section (and conform the table of contents accordingly): SEC. 1xx. PASSENGER AND CREW MANIFESTS FOR VEHICLES ARRIVING IN OR DE-PARTING FROM THE UNITED STATES. (a) S TATEMENT OF POLICY .\u2014Congress sup- ports the following recommendations from the Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States: (1) ''The small terrorist travel intelligence collection and analysis program currently in place has produced disproportionately useful results. It should be expanded. Since officials at the borders encounter travelers and their documents first and investigate travel facilitators, they must work closely with in-telligence officials. ''. (2) ''Information systems able to authen- ticate travel documents and detect potential terrorist indicators should be used at con-sulates, at primary border inspection lines, in immigration services offices, and in intel-ligence and enforcement units. ''. (3) ''We advocate a system for screening, not categorical profiling. A screening system looks for particular, identifiable suspects or indicators of risk. It does not involve guess-work about who might be dangerous. It re-quires frontline border officials who have the tools and resources to establish that people are who they say they are, intercept identifi-able suspects, and disrupt terrorist oper-ations. ''. (4) ''[T]he National Targeting Center, as- sisted by the new Terrorist Screening Cen-ter, provides information support to inspec-tors at ports of entry so that they can make more informed decisions about potential ter-rorists and harmful cargo attempting to enter the United States. ''. (b) A UTHORITY TO REQUIRE ADVANCED DE- LIVERY OF INFORMATION .\u2014Part II of title IV of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 434 the following new section: ''SEC. 435. PASSENGER AND CREW MANIFESTS FOR VEHICLES ARRIVING IN OR DE-PARTING FROM THE UNITED STATES. ''(a) P ASSENGER AND CREW MANIFESTS RE- QUIRED .\u2014The Commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection of the De-partment of Homeland Security may require each vehicle (including a rail car or bus) of a provider of covered transportation, as de-fined in the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 arriving in the United States from, or departing the United States to, a foreign port or place to transmit to United States Customs and Border Protec-tion a passenger manifest and crew manifest containing the information set forth in sub-section (c) for each such arrival in or depar-ture from the United States.

AUTOMATED TARGETING SYSTEM FOR PERSONS ENTERING OR DEPARTING THE UNITED STATES. (a) F INDINGS OF THE 9/11 C OMMISSION .\u2014Con- gress finds that the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly referred to as the 9/11 Commis-sion) concluded that \u2014 (1) ''The small terrorist travel intelligence collection and analysis program currently in place has produced disproportionately useful results. It should be expanded. Since officials at the border encounter travelers and their documents first and investigate travel facilitators, they must work closely with in-telligence officials. ''; (2) ''Information systems able to authen- ticate travel documents and detect potential terrorist indicators should be used at con-sulates, at primary border inspection lines, in immigration service offices, and intel-ligence and enforcement units. ''; (3) ''The President should direct the De- partment of Homeland Security to lead the effort to design a comprehensive screening system, addressing common problems and setting common standards with systemwide goals in mind. ''; (4) ''A screening system looks for par- ticular, identifiable suspects or indicators of risk. It does not involve guesswork about who might be dangerous. It requires front-line border officials who have the tools and resources to establish that people are who they say they are, intercept identifiable sus-pects, and disrupt terrorist operations. ''; and (5) ''Inspectors adjudicating entries of the 9/11 hijackers lacked adequate information and knowledge of the rules. A modern border and immigration system should combine a biometric entry-exit system with accessible files on visitors and immigrants, along with intelligence on indicators of terrorist trav-el.''. (b) A UTOMATED TARGETING SYSTEM FOR PERSONS ENTERING OR DEPARTING THE UNITED STATES .\u2014The Secretary of Homeland Secu- rity, acting through the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, may estab-lish an automated system for the purpose of the enforcement of United States law, in-cluding laws relating to anti-terrorism and border security, to assist in the screening of persons seeking to enter or depart the United States (in this section referred to as the ''system '') through the use of covered transportation. (c) N OPRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION .\u2014The Sec- retary, acting through the Commissioner, shall ensure than an administrative process is established, or application of an existing administrative process is extended, pursuant to which any individual may apply to correct any information retained by the system es-tablished under subsection (b). Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating a private right of action and no court shall have jurisdiction based on any of the provi-sions of this section to hear any case or claim arising from the application of the system or the corrective administrative process established or applied under this sec-tion. (d) R ULE OF CONSTRUCTION .\u2014Nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating, diminishing, or weakening the provisions of any Federal or State law that prevents or protects against the unauthorized collection or release of personal records. (e) A UTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS .\u2014 There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section. (The information contained herein was provided by Democratic Minority on mul-tiple occasions throughout the 109th Con-gress.) T HEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be de-bating. Mr. Clarence Cannon 's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308 -311) de- scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ''a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge. '' To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker 's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ''the refusal of the House to sustain the de- mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition '' in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R -Illinois) said: ''The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition. '' Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say ''the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever. '' But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the defini-tion of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here 's how the Rules Committee described the rule using information form Congressional Quarterly 's ''American Con- gressional Dictionary '': ''If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then man-ages an hour of debate and may offer a ger-mane amendment to the pending business. '' Deschler 's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ''Amending Special Rules '' states: ''a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate. '' (Chapter 21, sec- tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejec-tion of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member lead-ing the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or mo-tion and who controls the time for debate thereon. '' Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic major-ity's agenda and allows those with alter- native views the opportunity to offer an al-ternative plan. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous ques-tion on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursu- ant to House Resolution 270 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 1401. b1429 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1401) to improve the security of railroads, pub-lic transportation, and over-the-road buses in the United States, and for other purposes, with Mr. B UTTERFIELD in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. General debate shall not exceed 1 hour and 20 minutes, with 1 hour equal-ly divided and controlled by the chair-man and ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland Security and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and rank-ing minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. T HOMPSON ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. K ING) each will control 30 minutes, and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. O BERSTAR ) and the gen- tleman from Florida (Mr. M ICA) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi. b1430 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Three years ago this month, 10 explo- sions shook Madrid 's commuter rail systems, killing 191 people and leaving thousands wounded. As Americans, we mourned the loss felt by Spain. We wondered whether terrorists would try the same here at home. Then we wait-ed. The next year, suicide bombers at- tacked the Tube in London. Last year, it was Mumbai. Last month, it was New Delhi. Each time we watched and waited. Mr. Chairman, the time for won- dering and waiting has come and gone. Today, we act. The Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 makes clear that America simply will not wait for terrorists to attack our trains, buses and subways. We will act now to secure them. A bipartisan bill, H.R. 1401, was passed unanimously out of the Com-mittee on Homeland Security. This leg-islation goes a long way to protect our rail and mass transit systems so that we can move freely, yet securely, through our communities. For example, it requires rail and pub- lic transportation systems to complete vulnerability assessments and security plans. It requires the Department of Homeland Security to finally develop a strategy for rail and transportation se-curity. It strengthens intelligence and information-sharing efforts. It ensures that hardworking rail and public trans-portation employees are trained and on the lookout for security violations. It requires railroads to use the most se-cure routes to transport hazardous ma-terials. It provides for much-needed R&D testing and technology in the rail and public transportation arena. I am certain that bill is not without its naysayers. There are some that have and will continue to say that we can never secure these systems. I have heard many excuses from people in the past years. They say that the systems are too expensive, that the systems are too open, that we should only worry about aviation. I say in response, if Congress does nothing and America is attacked, it will be our responsibility. We will de-serve to be judged harshly for our inac-tion. Instead of waiting, let 's do some- thing right and protect the people we are here to serve. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Chairman, I submit these two letters, correspondence between myself and Mr. W AX- MAN, chairman of the Committee on Oversight VerDate Aug 31 2005 01:38 Mar 28, 27, 2007 and Government Reform, regarding H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Se-curity Act of 2007. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COM- MITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOV- ERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, March 26, 2007. Hon. B ENNIE G. T HOMPSON , Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Secu- rity, Washington, DC. DEARBENNIE : The Committee on Homeland Security reported H.R. 1401, the ''Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007, '' on March 22, 2007. As you know, H.R. 1401 contains provisions within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform, specifically section 112 dealing with whistle-blower protections for various federal employees and contractors. Because of your desire to move this legisla- tion expeditiously, I have agreed to waive consideration of the bill by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I ap-preciate your responsiveness after our dis-cussions including, in a manager 's amend- ment, a number of changes to the Committee reported bill. By agreeing to waive consideration of the bill, the Committee does not waive jurisdic-tion over H.R. 1401. In addition, the Com-mittee reserves its authority to seek con-ferees on any provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction during any House- Senate conference that may be convened on this or similar legislation. Finally, I ask that you please include this letter and your response in the Congres-sional Record during consideration of the legislation on the House floor. Thank you for your attention to these matters. Sincerely, H ENRY A. W AXMAN , Chairman. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, March 26, 2007. Chairman H ENRY WAXMAN , Committee on Oversight and Government Re- form, Washington, DC. DEAR HENRY : Thank you for your recent letter expressing the Committee on Over-sight and Government Reform 's jurisdic- tional interest in H.R. 1401, the ''Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. '' The Committee on Homeland Security ap-preciates your willingness to work coopera-tively on this important legislation. The Committee on Homeland Security rec- ognizes your jurisdictional interest over pro-visions contained in this bill, as amended, and appreciates your agreement not to re-quest a sequential referral. The Committee on Homeland Security acknowledges that your decision to forgo a sequential referral on this legislation does not waive, reduce or otherwise affect the jurisdiction of the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Re-form. Accordingly, the Committee on Home-land Security will support your efforts to participate as conferees in any House-Senate conference on this legislation or in any other legislation that includes this legislation. A copy of this letter, together with the let- ter you sent on this matter, will be included in the Committee 's report on the bill and the Congressional Record when the bill is consid-ered on the House floor. Thank you for your continued cooperation, and I look forward to working with you as H.R. 1401 proceeds through the legislative process. Sincerely, B ENNIE G. T HOMPSON , Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. At the outset, let me thank Chair- man T HOMPSON not only for his work on this bill in particular but for the spirit of cooperation that prevailed throughout this entire period leading up to today. I also want to commend Mr. L UN- GREN , who was chairman of the sub- committee in the previous Congress which did much of the groundwork for this legislation and for the dedication that he has shown and continued in his efforts as subcommittee ranking mem-ber. Mr. T HOMPSON had pledged, upon be- coming chairman of the full com-mittee, that will be a main priority for him, and he has delivered. There are certain parts of the bill that I would have problems with. But having said that, I certainly commend him for the effort he has put into this and, again, for level of cooperation not only be-tween him and me but between other members of the committee, between majority staff and the minority staff. Mr. Chairman, September 11 changed all our worlds, and we have attempted in various ways to meet the threat that is presented to us by international Is-lamic terrorism. Much work has been done at the airports. Last year, we adopted very extensive and expansive port security legislation, chemical plant security legislation. Some strides have been made towards rail and transit security. But today 's bill, today 's legislation is very much needed to take a more significant step down that road. We saw from the attacks on March 11, 2004, in Madrid; the attacks of July 7 in London in 2005; and the attacks in India on commuter lines, that terror-ists certainly are targeting our rail and transit for terrorist attack, one of the reasons being that it is so much more difficult to secure transit than it is air-ports. Certainly, looking at it very paro- chially, from my own perspective in New York, the New York City subway system, it has more than 400 subway stations. It has over 1,500 exits and en-trances to those stations. In addition to that, we have many, many tens of thousands of commuters coming in from the suburbs of Long Island, up-state New York and New Jersey every day. It is not just a New York issue, by any means. This is an issue which af-fects rail and transit throughout the country, but it is an issue that must be addressed. We have to look at the possibility that the next terrorist attack, like London, Madrid and India, will be launched from the suburbs. It is not just the inner city subways, big city commuter systems, but it is all of them. All of them have to be protected to the extent that we can. We also have to support those sys- tems which we believe can work, such as the VIPER system, which I believe is essential. We have to have training for the se- curity personnel. I wish that the legis-lation had also provided that the fund-ing could go directly to the police, who provide security. It won 't be you will have to go through the intermediary carriers, which I think is not a step in the right direction, but I also under-stand the realities of what has to be done. I think that certainly the police and the transit workers are the front line of defense when it comes to secur-ing our mass transit, and it is essential that they receive the training that they need. It is also essential that there be cap- ital improvements, that, for instance, the tunnels leading into main termi-nals be reinforced, that the escape pre-cautions be improved upon, that the first responders have access to tunnels and terminals in times of terrorist at-tack. So these are all issues which I believe are addressed to a significant extent in the legislation. As we said during the previous debate on the rule, there are parts of the legis-lation, though, which would have been very, very essential, I think, to have had amendments ruled in order. Mr. L UNGREN , I am sure, will be addressing some of these issues, but I am con-cerned about the whole issue on the whistleblowers as to what we do to pro-tect national security secrets and top secret materials and why the govern-ment will be, in effect, precluded from asserting the State secret defense. That is, to me, a very, very significant issue, and it is one where I believe the legislation does not give us adequate protection. Also, on the issue of Freedom of In- formation, which Ms. G INNY BROWN - WAITE will discuss as to how we can protect top secret and classified infor-mation, all of this to me is important. But, having said that, this legislation is a very, very significant step forward. It is a major step forward, and it is an area where, again, we realize in a bi-partisan way that more had to be done. While significant, more has to be done in the future, because we have an enemy which is constantly adapting, an enemy which is vicious and deadly. As has been proven on 9/11, they can use any number of means at their dis-posal. We have to think outside the box. We have to try to anticipate what they are going to do. If, God forbid, there is an attack, we want to make sure our peo- ple are able to respond as quickly and as effectively as possible. I believe that this legislation addresses much of that. I want to thank the chairman for, again, the open-mindedness that he has had on this in accepting many of our suggestions and also negotiating and working with us and, again, just devel-oping and showing a spirit of biparti-sanship, which I think is really essen-tial. Homeland Security should not be a partisan issue. We will and we do have VerDate Aug 31 2005 01:38 Mar 28, H3101 March 27, 2007 honest differences, but I think the overwhelming majority of the issues affecting Homeland Security can and should be addressed in a bipartisan way. On those issues that we cannot re- solve, we can have honest, intelligent differences on them without in any way questioning the motives of either side and also realizing that sometimes very pragmatic decisions have to be made. We can 't allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. I thank Chairman T HOMPSON . I cer- tainly thank Ranking Member L UN- GREN both for his efforts in the last Congress and in this Congress for all that he has done and also the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON - LEE). Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the dis-tinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. P ERLMUTTER ). Mr. PERLMUTTER. Thank you, Mr. THOMPSON . Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Pub-lic Transportation Security Act. This bill finally addresses the security of our Nation 's rail and mass transit in- dustries, and it has been put together in a bipartisan fashion. The bill includes commonsense provi- sions that require transportation pro-viders to conduct thorough risk assess-ment and threat mitigation plans. It also develops security training guide-lines for front-line workers who are the eyes and ears on the ground. Finally, it gives over $1 billion in Federal grants for first responder training, for purchasing of emergency response equipment, interoperable communications systems and cargo and passenger screening equipment. These steps identify where we are vul-nerable and give the right people the training and equipment to make us less so. I also commend the committee for adopting the two amendments I intro-duced. The first, which I introduced with the help of Congressman J OHNSALAZAR from Colorado, adds Transportation Technology Center, Inc., in Colorado to the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium so that it can bring its ex-pertise in providing additional security to rail and mass transit systems. As the Nation 's premier rail training fa- cility, this will give greater ability to respond to rail disasters. My other amendment is one that I worked on with my friend from Cali-fornia, and it clarifies Department of Homeland Security rules on what crimes constitute security risks for employees during a background check, and it provides a redress process for in-dividuals who feel they were unfairly fired or terminated. Mr. Chairman, the security of Amer- ica's railroad and public transit sys- tems are too important to ignore any longer. This bipartisan, commonsense bill will drastically improve our secu-rity. I urge an ''aye'' vote. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I yield such time as he may con-sume to the gentleman from Cali-fornia, Mr. L UNGREN . Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. I thank the ranking member for that and at the outset if I could ask the gentleman from Colorado if he would engage in a colloquy to clarify a sec-tion of the bill with me. Mr. PERLMUTTER. I certainly would, sir. Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. At committee, the gentleman and I worked to clarify language in sec-tion 120, which he just referred to, re-garding background checks on employ-ees. We included language that speci-fied that nothing in this section of the bill was intended to preempt State and local governments from enacting or en-forcing requirements regarding crimi-nal background checks. Further, we agreed, and the com- mittee agreed in report language, that this section was not intended to pro-hibit an employer, including State and local governments, from making any employment decisions otherwise per- missible under Federal, State or local law. I would also like to clarify my under- standing that this section is intended to impact employers who are com-plying with the Department of Home-land Security requirements, regulation or guidance, but does not apply to em-ployers who conduct background checks for other reasons. I would ask the gentleman and yield to him whether this is his under-standing of the intent of the section. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Yes, I concur with your description of my amend-ment. I thank you for the question. First, I would like to thank the com- mittee and my friend from California, because we worked out language that would prevent preemption of Federal, State or local laws for security back-ground checks. Furthermore, these requirements only apply to Department of Homeland Security guidelines. Private employers may conduct subsequent or alternative security background checks, looking for other crimes, based on their em-ployment agreements or other applica-ble laws. However, if a person is adversely af- fected by that security check with re-gard to his or her employment, the em-ployer may not use Homeland Security as the impetus for that adverse deci-sion. This section addresses the concerns brought to our attention at a hearing on the impacts of background checks on the transportation workforce. Addi-tionally, it provides a redress process modeled after the transportation work-er identification card program that carefully balances the importance of background checks while protecting the Nation 's critical infrastructure. Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. I thank the gentleman for working with me on this bill and for clarifying this section. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bill. This is a bill which we have worked on for some time. We started in the last Congress, holding hearings on this in a bipartisan basis. We at-tempted to get information from the public and private sector in these areas of our economy. I congratulate the chairman of the full committee and the chairperson of the subcommittee for moving forward with dispatch on this issue. b1445 We did work on other sectors of our economy with respect to the issue of security against terrorist threats. We did very good work in the area of port security. We did very good work in the area of chemical facility security. I hope that we will continue to do work in the area of the trucking industry. Where we are talking about the rail system and mass transit systems there is a demonstrated need for us to act, for us to have guidance from the Fed-eral Government to State and local governments in cooperation with State and local governments, and for us to have guidance for the private sector and to work with the private sector in dealing with this threat that threatens all of us, public and private sector com-bined. At the same time, I would suggest that there are a couple of concerns that I have about what form this bill may take. One of the areas that I tried, by way of presenting a suggested amendment to the Rules Committee to improve this legislation, was in the area of whistleblower. I mentioned this earlier in the debate on the rule, but let me just stress why this is impor-tant. We are dealing with an area in which we are requiring and requesting that other entities work with the Fed-eral Government in coming up with se-curity measures. And as a result of that, there will be information that we do not want shared with the outside world, that we certainly do not want shared in a public venue such that those who would do us harm would have an opportunity to be effective in their intent. And that is why I was concerned, and other Members on my side of the aisle were concerned, about the whistle-blower provisions here, which, frankly, do not carve out an exception for that area of the law dealing with security- sensitive information. This is of such concern that I under- stand the administration would rec-ommend a veto of this bill, not on the substance of it, but on the whistle-blower provision, and there is no rea-son for us to run into that difficulty. Secondly, in the area that will be dis- cussed by the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. B ROWN -WAITE, we have the concern about allowing this information out, not in a whistleblower setting, but just VerDate Aug 31 2005 03:38 Mar H3102 March 27, 2007 allowing this information out as a re- sult of requests under the Freedom of Information Act. And remember, prior to 9/11 we used to have all sorts of information about nuclear facilities and other entities dealing with power, such that someone could go on an Internet search and find out exactly what the vulnerabilities of those particular facilities happened to be. We realized after 9/11 that in our ef-fort to get everything out to the public we had probably damaged ourselves in terms of our vulnerability. Here is another area where we are not, in my judgment, giving enough concern about the possible ill effects of our effort to get everything out in the public. And what we have said, and Ms. B ROWN -WAITE's amendment attempted to do, was to try and say, in those areas where we have security-sensitive information, there ought to be an ex-ception from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. We did this on a bipartisan basis in the Mari-time Security Bill a couple of Con-gresses ago. Why we are not doing the same thing here, I do not understand. And if we had had our amendment to bring forward, we could have debated that. And I hope we will take care of that problem on the Senate side or in conference. The last thing I would suggest is I understand there is going to be an amendment presented on the floor about alternative material sources. This deals with toxic inhalation mate-rials. We worked very closely, I worked personally with the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. M ARKEY ) in this specific area, and we managed to come up with a bipartisan, balanced ap-proach to that. And I just hope when we have the short time allowed for de-bate on that amendment, we will de-bate it in the context of the bipartisan, balanced approach that we developed in our committee and brought forth to this floor. If you are going to present an amend- ment which basically is going to have the effect, whether intended or other-wise, to remove these materials from rail to our highways, how can we say we are any safer? And, frankly, that is what that amendment will do. So I hope Members will look at this, not as a partisan issue, and not saying, well, it was offered by the majority side or the minority side, therefore I am going to vote for it or defeat it on that basis, but look at the actual words in there and look at what the impact will be. We have made some mistakes in the past in our effort to do things that we have done in the past without the knowledge of the threat of terrorism that came upon us in 9/11. Let us not complete action on this bill as if we were dealing with it on 9/10. This is a bill that ought to be debated, consid-ered, and voted on in the full light of the events that took place on 9/11 and thereafter. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. L OWEY ). Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. I want to thank Chairman T HOMPSON and Ranking Member K ING for moving this bill to the floor in a bi-partisan manner. The President 's budget request for fiscal year 2008 includes only $41 mil-lion for TSA for surface transpor-tation, less than 1 percent of the TSA budget. From fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2006, DHS distributed approxi-mately $387 million for rail and mass transit security grants. On average, that is only one penny of Federal homeland security funding spent for each of the 9.5 billion transit passenger trips each year. This number is min-iscule compared with the average Fed-eral security investment of $9 per air-line passenger trip. This legislation represents the first step in closing the enormous gap be-tween Federal spending on aviation se-curity and spending on security for rail and public transportation. As we saw in the uncovered plot to bomb the Herald Square subway sta-tion in New York City, as well as the horrific attacks in Madrid, London and Mumbai, terrorists are targeting mass transit systems, and we must do what it takes to protect and secure our transportation networks. This bill, for the first time, author- izes dedicated risk-based funding for the security of railroad carriers, public transportation systems, and over-the- road bus systems. It also provides for fire and line-safe- ty improvements to be made at Am-trak tunnels throughout the critically important Northeast corridor, includ-ing six tunnels in the New York City area. Every day, thousands of my constitu- ents join more than 7 million riders traveling on Metropolitan Transit Au-thority trains and buses throughout the New York metro area. They expect and deserve to know that the Federal Government is just as committed to rail security as it is to other homeland security priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I yield such time as he may con-sume to the former sheriff of King County in Washington State and cur-rent ranking member of the Intel-ligence Subcommittee, Mr. R EICHERT . Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for allowing me time to speak this afternoon. I also want to take a moment to congratu-late Chairman T HOMPSON on bringing this legislation forward. And I do rise, Mr. Chairman, in sup- port of H.R. 1401. A number of the speakers already have touched upon how the world has changed since Sep-tember 11, but sometimes we say those words and, really, the heart and the meat of those words don 't really touch our hearts. And if I could just take a moment to share a story with you. As I was traveling through my dis- trict a few months ago along the free-ways just south of the city of Seattle, I looked up at one of the traffic advi-sory boards. Usually what you see on those advisory boards are traffic alerts: take a different route; traffic accident ahead; severe hazard is ahead; exit free-way; blocked freeway ahead. Those are the things that we are used to seeing on our traffic advisory boards in the Seattle area. But on this day, as I looked up at the traffic advisory board, what it said was, SEA -TAC Airport security alert. No gels, no liquids allowed on planes in carry-on luggage. That, to me, just struck for a mo- ment at, really, the true change that has happened since September 11. Free-dom has been impacted by the attack on the United States of America. And as we look at protecting our homeland, it is so important for our protection to be coordinated by law enforcement, by local law enforcement, for grant money to be directed toward local law enforce-ment and partnering with the Federal system, partnering with the Depart-ment of Transportation, partnering with the airport and the rail and secu-rity people who protect our railways, highways and airports. All of those have to be brought together and in con-junction with the private sector. That is the duty of local law enforcement to bring people together, to make our neighborhoods and communities safe. But, as I support H.R. 1401, as re- ported unanimously by the Committee on Homeland Security, I am in strong opposition to the manager 's amend- ment that is up for consideration today. Under the version of this legislation, Mr. Chairman, approved by the Com-mittee on Homeland Security, the De-partment of Homeland Security would be responsible for distributing rail and public transportation security grants. Unfortunately, good policy has given way to politics. And in the manager 's amendment, we see the responsibility for administering these grants has shifted from the Department of Home-land Security to the Department of Transportation. In a statement by the National Sher- iffs' Association on this legislation, the association writes: ''Specifically, the National Sheriffs ' Association, sheriffs and law enforcement officials have a vested interest in protecting national and homeland security and, in order to do so, it is paramount that an obvious and central entity exist to which sher-iffs can turn to for support and assist-ance. Thus, the National Sheriffs ' As- sociation believes that allowing the Department of Homeland Security to maintain the primary role in the as-sessment and the distribution of grant monies concerning rail security will help maintain such a necessary and ef-ficient Homeland Security infrastruc-ture. '' VerDate Aug 31 2005 03:38 H3103 March 27, 2007 Let me repeat that last part, please: ''Allowing the Department of Home- land Security to maintain the primary role in the assessment and distribution of grant monies concerning security will help maintain such a necessary and efficient Homeland Security infra-structure. '' In addition to this ill-conceived move, the manager 's amendment makes another critical error in deter-mining who is eligible for the $2.4 bil-lion of funds for rail security. Again, the version of this legislation reported out of the Committee on Homeland Se-curity allowed State, local and tribal government entities, as well as rail-road carriers, to apply for these grants. Risk-based, threat-based. The man-ager's amendment allows eligible rail- road carriers only to apply for these grants. Mr. Chairman, as a former sheriff of a major metropolitan area, I under-stand local law enforcement plays an important role in protecting our Na-tion's transit and rail systems. A cyn- ical person might say that the man-ager's amendment serves as nothing more than a $2.4 billion earmark for Amtrak, though I am sure that that is not the overt intent of its author. While the manager 's amendment has made some improvements to this legis-lation, specifically, the whistleblower provisions, I remain in strong opposi-tion to the dangerous changes the amendment makes to the grant portion of this bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. L ANGEVIN ), the chairman of the Emerg- ing Threats Subcommittee. (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want to commend him on his out-standing leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Rail and Public Trans-portation Security Act, H.R. 1401, which will significantly strengthen the safety of our Nation 's rail and mass transit systems. Mass transit systems worldwide have long been terrorist targets. b1500 Within the past few years, terrorists have exploited security vulnerabilities to carry out attacks on mass transit systems in London, Madrid, and Mumbai. We are fortunate to have es-caped attack here in the United States, but make no mistake about it, the threat continues to be very real. Each day, over 11.3 million Ameri- cans utilize our Nation 's rail and pub- lic transit systems. Therefore, we must strike a delicate balance between tightening security and allowing for the free flow of passengers heading to school, work, and recreational activi-ties. One of the ways we can make a dif- ference is in training our mass transit and railway personnel. Rail and mass transit security workers are our first line of defense in identifying abnormal activity and protecting passengers from potentially harmful situations. It is therefore vital that we equip them with the training that they need to be effective. Now, this legislation will cre-ate mandatory security training pro-grams to prepare all front-line railroad and public transportation workers for potential threat conditions. I am also pleased that this bill fi- nally authorizes additional funding for enhanced security efforts. On average, Mr. Chairman, we spend $9 per air pas-senger annually on security but only 1 penny per rail and mass transit pas-senger. This is clearly an unbalanced approach to our transportation secu-rity. Now, while we should continue to al- locate sufficient funding to secure our aviation sector, we must also increase the resources we dedicate to rail and mass transit. I am confident that H.R. 1401 will bring us another step closer to achieving this goal. Mr. Chairman, we have certainly come a long way in making our Nation safer since September 11, but we are still not yet safe. This bill, combined with other homeland security measures passed in recent months, will close many of the existing gaps and make our Nation safer. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of leg-islation. Again, I commend the chair-man for his leadership in bringing this important bill to the floor. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 12minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Co-lumbia (Ms. N ORTON ). Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. T HOMPSON and the ranking mem- ber, Mr. O BERSTAR , and his ranking member as well for this very important legislation that has come forward today. Perhaps you, too, can hear the collec- tive sighs of the American people now that we are doing something about rail and mass transit. They have wondered, and how could they not, whether the bombs that were planted in Madrid and in London would somehow find their way into their own subways or whether the Hazmat accidents could be more than that here in this country. I was moved by these vulnerabilities to be the lead sponsor first of the Safe TRAINS Act, then the Secure TRAINS Act. After all, 800,000 Federal workers use our Metro daily. That did not in-spire the Federal Government to move forward. Finally, we have a bipartisan bill to relieve the national anxiety of the average American about the forms of transportation she uses most. They watched as we poured billions into air travel security. We had to do it, it was after the fact. But we left huge vulnerabilities. Union Station, for example, the hub of the entire region, you have beneath it the trains running underneath a hall where Members every other day come to celebrate in the evening one or the other kind of event. The District of Co-lumbia was driven by the vacuum to actually pass its own rerouting legisla-tion that has not even been dismissed ever yet. That shows you how vulner-able we are. The bill finally instructs the Depart- ment of Homeland Security to exercise leadership, to use its expertise so that transit systems are not working on se-curity on a case-by-case basis. We can't protect the country by shoring up one mode of transportation alone\u2014a vir-tual invitation to then move elsewhere. I think there is an important lesson here. I am on the Aviation Sub-committee, so I have wanted to shore up air travel. But by shoring up one mode of transportation, we may be of-fering a virtual invitation for terror-ists to go to the next most vulnerable target. That turns out to be rail and mass transit, where we could least af-ford terrorist events. That is where the American people are. I thank both sides of the aisle for coming together on this bill to go precisely where they are to protect the public at last. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 12minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. E THERIDGE ). Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the chair- man for yielding, and I commend him and the ranking member for their hard work on this piece of legislation. For too long, the Department of Homeland Security has ignored threats to rail and public transportation and buses; and I am pleased to help cospon-sor this legislation to correct this problem. In the face of recent attacks in Lon- don and Madrid and with our own sub-ways and buses still vulnerable, I am hopeful that this legislation will make sure that the Department addresses this critical work. In addition to closing security gaps in rail and mass transit safety efforts and providing support and guidance for training, security planning and re-search and development, this bill con-tains language that I proposed requir-ing the Department of Homeland Secu-rity to assess threats to our Nation's children posed by security risks to school bus transportation. School buses have been targets of terrorists throughout the world, in-cluding here in the United States. Just last month, the FBI said that members of extremist groups have purchased school buses and obtained licenses to operate them, while adding that ''par-ents and children have nothing to fear.'' I do not believe we can take these assessments at face value with-out a comprehensive threat assessment of school bus transportation. VerDate Aug 31 2005 01:38 Mar 28, H3104 March 27, 2007 School transportation is a patchwork of systems including public entities, privately owned school bus companies, contractors who provide school trans-portation, individual owner-operators of school buses who contract with school districts or school systems. The risks are poorly understood, as the FBI's muddled message indicates. An attack on our school buses would be devastating not only in the lives harmed but also in the psychological and symbolic impact. As a former su-perintendent of schools for the State of North Carolina, I know that children, parents, and schools deserve our school buses to get children to school as safe-ly and as securely as possible. We owe our children no less than to be able to confidently say that our transpor-tation system is secure. The bill requires DHS to perform a comprehensive threat assessment for school transportation and make rec-ommendations on how to respond to these threats. The bill requires vulner-ability assessments and security plans for other modes of transportation in the public trust, and it should be the same for our children. I urge everyone to vote for it. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yield- ing the time and to the ranking mem-ber for all your hard work. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from South Texas (Mr. C UELLAR ). Mr. CUELLAR. I thank the gen- tleman for yielding, and I also thank Chairman T HOMPSON for the strong leadership that he has shown on this bill. I also thank Mr. K INGfor the bi- partisan support that he has shown on this bill and with the committee. I rise in support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. H.R. 1401 is an important piece of legislation that takes steps to secure our Nation 's railroads, over-the- road bus networks, and the public transportation systems. In addition, the Rail and Public Transportation Se-curity Act includes provisions that take strides in enhancing the security of transportation systems at our criti-cally important international land bor-ders. My hometown of Laredo, Texas, is one of the busiest ports of entry into the United States and a hub of inter-national commerce. Approximately 1,600 railcars cross the border daily in Laredo. Additionally, 163,000 cars cross annually that are loaded with freight and headed to destinations throughout the United States. To meet the challenge of securing our Nation 's border rail ports of entry, I worked with my chairman and my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee to include two important additions to H.R. 1401. The first one supports the development and emer-gency response and recovery tech-niques that can be used at our inter- national borders. The second gives rail inspection facilities at our inter-national borders a priority to receive critically important rail security grant funding authorized by this legislation. I am proud to support this legislation that will make our Nation 's rail, tran- sit, and bus systems more secure and that will ensure that the safety of citi-zens living across the Nation are secure as they use these systems. Mr. Chairman, I again thank our chairman for the leadership that he has shown on this piece of legislation and for leading our committee. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to a former member, stellar member, of the House Homeland Security Committee, Mr. P ASCRELL of New Jersey, who has moved on, but he still has an interest. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Rail and Pub-lic Transportation Security Act of 2007. This is critical legislation designed to focus on a long-time vulnerability that exists within our Nation. This bill is a real product of bipar- tisan cooperation. So I want to com-mend our leader, Chairman B ENNIE THOMPSON , as well as Ranking Member PETER KING, both of whom I enjoyed working with and continue to work with, even though I am not officially on the committee. You have performed a tremendous service to this country, and we are indebted to you. Your sa-gacity is seconded by no one. We know that rail and public trans- portation represent a very tempting target for those who wish to do us harm. London and Madrid are just two recent examples of the mass transit systems that are plagued by terrorism. Last year, in fact, the committee went to Madrid, to Rome, and to London, and we saw the evil deeds of terrorists, and we learned much, and they learned much from us. Thankfully, H.R. 1401 will make needed and long-overdue in-vestments in America 's public trans- portation to ensure that we are safer and more secure. The bill provides for comprehensive, mandatory training for front-line workers. That is so critical for us to understand. These are folks that are on the job every day. Transit employees must know how to identify risks and respond in case of a threat or attack. And you know, Mr. Chairman, I felt very strongly about this, discussed it with both of you, that we need to get more retired law enforcement into these positions of security. They know how to detect the threats that are on the line. The bill also enhances whistleblower protections so that workers can be free to report security concerns. This is critical, Mr. Chairman. This has been so critical in exposing the security gaps at airports throughout the United States of America. If people are not free to tell us what they see day to day and are fearful that there will be reac-tion against them, that is not good. Most importantly, this bill provides $7.3 billion to public transit agencies, Amtrak, bus operators, and other pro-viders of rail and public transpor-tation. We want people to feel as safe on the trains as they are in the air. We know full well that rail and mass transit have been negligently under-funded in terms of security since 9/11, and it is long past time that we do this. b1515 Today we do that. I applaud the chairman and I applaud the entire com-mittee for their hard work. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I reserve my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Houston, Texas (Mr. A L GREEN ). Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair- man, I especially want to thank the chairman for his outstanding leader-ship. It is an honor and really a pre-eminent privilege to serve with him on this committee. I also thank the rank-ing member. I would thank also the subcommittee Chair, S HEILA JACKSON - LEE, from the great State of Texas. She and I have districts that are juxtaposed right next to each other. Mr. Chairman, I am supporting this legislation because it authorizes $140 million to Amtrak to improve tunnels in the Northeast corridor. It requires programs that will cause our transit employees to be trained on how to pre-vent, prepare for, and respond to ter-rorist attacks. Our first line of defense will be prepared to defend as a result of this bill. This bill requires that we look for- ward, and it authorizes $200 million over the next 4 years to find solutions to security threats. This bill protects those who would protect us in that the whistleblowers will be protected. I trust that while it may not be a perfect provision, it is better than what we had, and I assure the public that this is going to help us. This bill will help us to get the addi- tional inspectors that we need. We will move from 100 inspectors to 600 by 2010. This bill helps us to protect Amer- ica's future, our children, in that it provides for school bus transportation security assessments. This bill provides for enhanced secu- rity for shipments of sensitive mate-rials. Finally, of the many things I can say, I want to remind us that this bill provides that violators of the act will be punished. There are both civil and criminal penalties for violators. I think this is a good bill. I am hon- ored to have my name associated with it as an original cosponsor. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I continue to reserve my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 12minutes to the gentlelady from New York (Ms. C LARKE ). Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Chairman, I wish to thank Chairman T HOMPSON , Rank- ing Member K ING and Chairwoman VerDate Aug 31 2005 01:38 Mar 28, March 27, 2007 JACKSON -LEEfor their vigilance on this issue. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Rail and Public Transportation Secu-rity Act of 2007, H.R. 1401. In the past, Congress has passed laws to improve air and maritime security. With this bill, Congress is finally taking the very important step of securing America 's vast ground transportation systems. It is particularly important for my home city of New York, which has spent far more of its own treasury than any other city on securing its citizens. Along with providing much-needed funding for security improvements to mass transit, bridges and tunnels, this bill will also help fund police and coun-terterrorism task forces to patrol the areas and react to emergencies. Further, this bill provides $100 mil- lion over the next 4 years to bring about long-anticipated safety and secu-rity renovations at Penn Station, which sees thousands of New Yorkers and tourists from across America each day. I am particularly proud of the lan- guage included in the bill that ensures labor unions will play an integral role in the solution. Unions will now be eli-gible to receive a portion of the grant funding, allowing them to work hand- in-hand with transportation carriers on how to improve the safety of the work-ers and passengers alike. Also, for some time, many local gov- ernments and agencies have been con-cerned about their lack of involvement with the Federal side of the transpor-tation security process. For years, Fed-eral security inspectors have refused to consult with transit agencies about how best to patrol their facilities. This new bill will force DHS and DOT to work together with State and local governments when deciding how the Federal Government will interact with local agencies. H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Trans- portation Security Act of 2007, is an ex-cellent bill that will revolutionize transportation security in America, and I wholeheartedly recommend that my colleagues join me in voting ''yes'' for this bill. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I continue to reserve my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 12minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. S ALAZAR ). Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the gen- tleman from Mississippi for yielding, and I want to recognize the chairman and the ranking member for their ex-ceptional leadership on this critical issue. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Trans-portation Security Act of 2007, and urge its swift passage. Horrific terrorist events around the world have forced us to focus on rail se-curity. This bill is an important and necessary step towards protecting our Nation 's rail and surface transpor- tation safety. My district is home to the world-re- nowned Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado. TTCI 's Emergency Response Training Center conducts hands-on hazmat training for first responders and is known in the field as the premier graduate school for surface transportation hazmat train-ing. My good friend and fellow Coloradan, Mr. P ERLMUTTER , highlighted in com- mittee the critical role that TTCI plays in advancing rail security, re-search and development and hazmat training. By making TTCI the sixth member of the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, it will add a critical com-ponent to the consortium that is now missing. TTCI is the only facility in the Nation that has the experience and assets necessary to test new emergency response and recovery techniques. Add-ing TTCI to the consortium will help fulfill the goals of this bill, making our rail lines safer from homeland security threats by enabling the facility to ac-celerate its already outstanding work in the field of rail security. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the investment in rail and public transportation security and pas-sage of this much-needed bill. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I reserve my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-tleman from Chicago, Illinois (Mr. D AVIS). (Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Secu-rity Act of 2007, and I commend the Committees on Homeland Security and Transportation for such an outstanding piece of work. But I also want to just take this opportunity to pay serious appreciation to the chairman of Home-land Security, to the chairman of Transportation, Representative O BER- STAR , and to the chairman of Judici- ary, Representative J OHNCONYERS . I was involved in a situation with an issue that we brought to them, and, as a result of their humaneness, their se-rious understanding and their recogni-tion of the need to protect the rights of individuals throughout America, I think we ended up with a bill that I am strongly in support of, urge its passage and, again, commend all of these gen-tleman for their tremendous sensi-tivity and hard work. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlelady from Texas, Ms. S HEILA JACKSON -LEE. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the distin-guished chairman of the committee and thank the ranking member and the members of the committee who worked so diligently. Let me specifically thank the members of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Critical Infrastructure. Each and every one of them worked tirelessly to contribute to this bill, along with members of the full committee. This has been a very tough mountain to climb. We waited for 4 years to trav-el through a number of legislative ini-tiatives, and finally we reached a point where we are able to bring to the floor the Rail and Public Transportation Se-curity Act of 2007. Let me thank the chairperson, Mr. T HOMPSON , for his vigorous leadership and his concern, so much so that he or-ganized and made sure that the full Homeland Security Committee was or-ganized to have a subcommittee that would focus on transit systems which would include over-the-road buses, trucking and a number of other impor-tant transit systems or transportation systems that heretofore had not been covered. Let me also thank him for the inclu- sion of the aspect of critical infrastruc-ture because, interestingly enough, when you look at transportation sys-tems, critical infrastructure plays into the holistic approach to security. So this bill I think has a holistic approach to ensuring that we have security, and it has as a backdrop the tragedies of Madrid and the tragedies, of course, of London. So what we do is, how do we fix the problems. I think we have a hands-on approach, but a balanced approach, be-tween the Departments of Transpor-tation and Homeland Security. We in-crease the number of inspectors to 600. We require a national rail and public transportation security plan. For the first time in the history of this Nation, we will clarify the roles and respon-sibilities of Federal, State and local agencies, so that if you have a local transit agency, they will have the op-portunity to develop a transit security system. I would encourage my col-leagues as this bill makes its way that we focus on local jurisdictions having security plans. It will strengthen intelligence shar- ing. One of the Achilles heels of 9/11 was that we did not share intelligence. We will do that as relates to transpor-tation systems. Then we will lay out plans for public outreach and public education initia-tives. It will include strategies and time lines for research and develop. We have expanded, of course, this whole idea of security to diverse groups that have not heretofore had the oppor-tunity, minority institutions, minority contractors and women-owned busi-nesses that can become engaged. And, yes, our committee had a hear- ing on the tension, but also the separa-tion, between the hiring of individuals and the requirements of railroad com-panies versus the requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, so we wouldn 't use security as a reason for terminating individuals. This bill has a positive end to it. We will bring rail security to America, Mr. VerDate Aug 31 2005 03:38 Mar 28, H3106 March 27, 2007 Chairman. I am proud to have been the subcommittee Chair on this and proud of this committee. I ask my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill. As the Chairwoman for the Homeland Secu- rity's Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection, we have held numerous vital hearings on the topic of trans-portation security. These hearings were at-tended by the Subcommittee 's Ranking Mem- ber, Mr. L UNGREN from California, and other Committee Members from both parties. Over the past couple of months, the Com- mittee on Homeland Security has heard testi-mony on the important issue of rail, mass tran-sit, and over-the-road bus security. After hear-ing the experts ' testimony, I, like many Ameri- cans, am appalled by the failure to provide on-going and continuous oversight in transpor-tation security \u2014specifically, in the areas of rail and mass transit. Throughout the world, mass transit systems have long been targets of terrorist attacks. Al-gerian extremists set off bombs on the sub-ways of Paris in 1995 and 1996; the Irish Re-publican Army waged a long-running terrorist campaign against the London Underground; Palestinian terrorists have carried out suicide bombings on Israel 's buses; Chechnyan terror- ists killed 40 people by bombing the Moscow subway in 2004; and, in the first terrorist use of a chemical weapon, a Japanese cult \u2014Aum Shinrykyo \u2014released sarin gas on a Tokyo subway in 1995. Recent events make it clear that the threat continues. On the morning of March 11th, 2004, ten explosions occurred at the height of the Madrid rush hour aboard four commuter trains. On July 7, 2005, during the morning peak travel hours, three separate explosions ripped through the London Underground and a fourth explosion occurred on a double-decker bus. These four explosions, the result of co-ordinated suicide-bombings by British-born Is-lamic extremists, claimed the lives of 56 peo-ple and seriously injured hundreds more. Two weeks later, on July 21, 2005, another group of terrorists unsuccessfully attempted to attack London 's mass transit system again. On July 11th, 2006 a series of seven bomb blasts against the Suburban Railway in Mumbai (for-merly known as Bombay), capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra and India 's finan- cial capital resulted in 207 lost lives and over 700 injured. The recent attacks serve as a harsh re- minder of mass transit and rail security vulnerabilities. Both mass transit and rail sys-tems are public and used by millions of people daily. Because of their size, openness, and highly networked character, there are no obvi-ous checkpoints, like those at airports, to in-spect passengers and parcels. Passengers are strangers, promising attackers anonymity and easy escape. And attacks on mass transit \u2014the circulatory systems of urban areas \u2014can cause wide- spread fear, severely disrupt economic activ-ity, kill or injure large numbers of people, and alter our way of life. An attack on our freight rail, either the material being transported (such as hazardous materials, or vital commodities), or merely the system itself, could severely im-pact our national economy. As a result, both mass transit and rail sys- tems are attractive targets. Since September 11, 2001, according to the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, mass transit systems have been the target of more than 145 terrorist attacks. Due to their existence in high-population, high-risk urban areas, mass transit systems are also inevitably affected by any terrorist at-tack that may occur within that jurisdiction \u2014re- gardless of whether the transit system was the target of the attack. For example, during Sep-tember 11, 2001, two of New York City 's busi- est transit stations were lost and considerable damage occurred to the tunnel structures, en-dangering hundreds of lives underground. Great care was required to evacuate pas-sengers, locate and rescue trapped transit cars, and communicate instructions. The dam-age in New York City was so great that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Congress appro-priated $1.8 billion to rebuild the subway infra-structure that was damaged in the attacks. I am hopeful that through this legislation we can prevent such attacks rather than face the trag-ic consequences of 9/11 again. I refuse to sit idly by and allow another 9/11 or Madrid, London, or Mumbai bombing to disrupt our Nation and its critical infrastruc-ture\u2014it is with that conviction that I seek to address these issues. The recent world events should serve as a wake-up call that we must do more to secure our transportation systems and we must act quickly and responsibly.I firmly believe that the legislation before us today will take an important step in securing our transportation systems. Pursuant to the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 (ATSA), the Transpor-tation Security Administration (TSA) is respon-sible for the security of all modes of transpor-tation including rail and mass transit. TSA, however, has focused the majority of its re-sources and assets on aviation security in the past five years. Congress, recognizing TSA 's lack of progress in developing a security strategy for all modes of transportation, mandated the de-velopment of a National Strategy for Transpor-tation Security in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( ''9/11 Act ''). This strategy, although due April 1, 2005, was not finalized by TSA until September 2005. Moreover, the document provided by the De-partment of Homeland Security (DHS) did not meet the requirements set out by Congress, especially with regards to rail and mass transit security. Furthermore, subsequent congres-sionally mandated updates were also not met by TSA, resulting in the 9/11 Discourse Project giving the TSA a C \u00a5 for its efforts. TSA's failure to assume a leadership posi- tion on surface transportation security is plain-ly evident. It is time that we take action and leadership to help protect the more than 11.3 million passengers in 35 metropolitan areas and 22 states who use commuter, heavy, or light rail each weekday. There must be sub-stantial penalties for those who do not follow the security plans, vulnerability assessments, and regulations set out in this legislation. This bill provides the framework by which to create an ongoing and constant oversight process for our overlooked modes of transpor-tation. Working with other federal government agencies, the Department of Homeland Secu-rity will monitor and assess the progress made by transportation providers and their work-forces in implementing the security training mandated for transportation workers in this bill. I am also pleased that I was able to en-sure in this bill that DHS would leverage its work in regards to security training with the safety training which has already been devel-oped in universities and institutions of higher learning. These institutions with existing transpor- tation programs will also have an opportunity to participate in the National Transportation Center of Excellence Consortium. These pro-grams have spent numerous years developing solutions for transportation vulnerabilities and this knowledge should be employed. I am es-pecially pleased that minority serving institu-tions will play an active role in contributing to improving our transportation security. Furthermore, neighborhood and local partici- pation through programs such as Citizen Corps exercises is also critically important in facilitating security exercises. The millions of men and women who live next to railroad tracks and subway stations will be directly im-pacted if there is an attack, and they should be active and knowledgeable participants in preparing for such a tragic incident. Furthermore, I am pleased that I was able to work with Chairman T HOMPSON and Chair- man O BERSTAR on the issue of rail security grants for security improvements to new start rail projects and systems. New start rail projects throughout the country will be more secure because we were able to incorporate language ensuring that rail security grants are used for security plans for new start rail projects which have not become operational yet. Mr. Chairman, I also worked to ensure that this bill will authorize some much needed human resources to the Transportation Secu-rity Administration in the form of 600 additional rail security officers and inspectors. TSA will need additional manpower to meet the man-dates set out in this legislation, such as ap-proving of security plans and implementing training programs for covered transportation workers. The 100 additional officers I was able to secure will ensure that TSA is equipped to live up to its new mission. This bill also authorizes more than $5.1 bil- lion for the next four years, for rail, mass tran-sit, and bus security. The funds called for in this bill should be based on risk and the prior-ities established by DHS. With this bill \u2014for the first time \u2014we will have comprehensive vulner- ability assessments and security plans for rail, mass transit and buses. I find it completely appalling that this Admin- istration seems to be unwilling to act on rail and mass transit security until we are faced with another disaster. I shudder to think that if the Washington, DC or New York subway sys-tems were attacked, and mass casualties re-sulted, that we would be thinking that more could have been done to prevent such a trag-edy. We will be desperately trying to figure out how to prepare for a disaster that has already happened and holding hearing after hearing to find out where we dropped the ball. The time to prepare is now, and I am committed to se-curing our nation 's rail and mass transit sys- tem expeditiously. We have been blessed thus far that our rail and public transportation sys-tems have not been attacked. We should make our best efforts to ensure that we do not overlook this blessing. From the terrorist attacks that have occurred around the world, we know that terrorists will VerDate Aug 31 2005 03:38 Mar 28, H3107 March 27, 2007 target our rail and public transportation sys- tems. Despite this admonition, the agency cre-ated and funded by Congress to address the issue of transportation security has consist-ently dropped the ball when it comes to rail and public transportation. We cannot let the lessons of Madrid, London, and Mumbai go unheeded. For the sake of the millions of Americans who use our rail and mass transit systems every day to go to work, school, and visit friends and family, we have to take charge on this security risk. What we are witnessing with the Transpor- tation Security Administration is a lack of com-plete accountability. The Transportation Secu-rity Administration is not being held fully ac-countable for protecting our transportation sys-tems and this must change. I acknowledge and appreciate the time that TSA Adminis-trator Kip Hawley has taken to participate in this important hearing. However, we cannot tolerate the TSA 's past inaction on this issue to continue for a moment longer. While it is understandable that we would put focus on the safety of air travel, given the events of 9/11, what cannot be justified is the completely lopsided attention by the Depart-ment to aviation security at the expense of rail and mass transit security. I am pleased that this Congress and Chairman T HOMPSON have decided to do what this Administration has thus far proved unwilling to do. That is, to pro-vide a comprehensive framework to secure this nation 's rail and public transportation sys- tems. We owe it to the public to safeguard the modes of transportation that allow them to carry on with their lives and drive this econ-omy. Millions of men and women ride our na-tion's rail and public transportation systems every day; we owe it to them to ensure that they can do so safely and securely. I hope that through today 's hearing and our continued efforts on the issue of rail and mass transit se-curity, we can resolve the asymmetric way in which we treat aviation versus rail security and resolve the substantial threat posed by inad-equate security on our rail and mass transit system. I want to thank my colleagues for all of their hard work and dedication to these important issues, but I also want to emphasize that our job is not complete until we pass this bill and send it to the President. I eagerly look forward to the expeditious enactment of this critical legislation. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, let me again commend Chairman T HOMPSON for his very high level of co- operation, for the dedication he has shown to this, and again thank Mr. L UNGREN , the ranking member of the subcommittee, for his efforts in the previous Congress and this Congress, and also the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE) for her efforts. Mr. Chairman, the country was caught unaware on September 11. We could perhaps say that we did not an-ticipate the ferocity of the attack or the nature of the attack or the nature of our enemy, but we no longer have that excuse. September 11 certainly made us fully aware of how deadly our enemy is. Since then, whether it be in-telligence reports or whether it be the attacks in London, Madrid or Mumbai, we realize also that mass transit is a favorite target of Islamic terrorists. So we have no excuses. We have to move forward, and that is what this legislation does. It sets a coordinated national policy toward dealing with at-tacks on our public transportation sys-tem. It coordinates at the national level with the State and local officials what has to be done. It provides a level of training to our transit workers and to our police. As I mentioned before, in New York, as Ms. C LARKE knows well, there are more than 5 million riders on our mass transit system every day. As the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P ASCRELL ) mentioned, he and I and a number of other members of the committee last year visited London and we visited Madrid. We saw the ex-tent of the carnage and the destruction that was caused. We full well realize that the next terrorist attack may very well be launched from the sub-urbs. It could be brought in on a com-muter train to our cities. The subway systems themselves, the mass transit systems themselves are extremely vul-nerable to attack. We can never be 100 percent secure. We can probably never reach the same level of protection on a subway system or mass transit system, for instance, that we can at our airports. b1530 We do a great deal. And that is what this bill does, it moves us forward. It provides levels of protection that we do not currently have. And it is going to be an ongoing work in progress. It is going to be something that requires our continued dedication, our contin-ued effort. It is going to require contin-ued bipartisan effort, bipartisan sup-port. So I look forward to working with the chairman at least for the next 21 months in his role as chairman and, whatever happens after that, continue to work with him. Because this is, again, an issue, it is a threat that goes far beyond any type of partisan divide. It is something that should bring us all together as Americans. There is so much that we have in common where our values and principles are shared, are in common that, as Democrats and Republicans and, most importantly, as Americans, we can work together. This bill goes very far in that direction. Again, I commend the chairman. I commend all of the members of the committee on both sides for their ef-forts. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, let me, at the close, thank my ranking member of the committee. Our committee, as you know, has a reputation of being one of the more bi-partisan committees here on the Hill; and I look forward to continuing that. Mr. K INGhas done a wonderful job. Clearly, this legislation helps close the gap in terms of vulnerability. Those people who fly have been reason-ably safe since 9/11. However, we clear-ly have vulnerabilities that we need to fix on the rail and public transit sys-tems. So what this bill does is move us in that direction. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ''aye'' on H.R. 1401. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. S NY- DER). All time has expired on this sec- tion of general debate which has been controlled by the gentleman from Mis-sissippi (Mr. T HOMPSON ) and the gen- tleman from New York (Mr. K ING). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. O BERSTAR ) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M ICA) each will control 10 minutes of general debate. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. This legislation is vitally important. It is long-standing. Actually, transpor-tation security legislation in the after-math of September 11 originated in the Committee on Transportation and In-frastructure, where the gentleman from Alaska, then the chairman, and I worked on a wide range of transpor-tation issues. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. M ICA), then the Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee, and I worked on what became the Transpor-tation Security Administration, the TSA, the aviation portion of it. So we have a long-standing interest and involvement and in-depth engage-ment in this issue of transportation se-curity. And now that the Homeland Se-curity Committee has been created, we share aspects of this jurisdiction with that committee under the able leader-ship of the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. T HOMPSON ), the able chairman of the committee. We are very grateful for the opportunity we have had to work together to align our interests and achieve a memorandum of under-standing that has been incorporated into the Rules of the House on the shared jurisdiction. Over a decade before September 11, 40-plus percent of terrorist incidents were carried out against rail systems and transit buses; and events of recent note show that those kinds of attacks continue. The transportation systems covered under this legislation cover over 11 bil-lion passengers. In the United States, every day 14 million people use public transportation for some 10 billion plus transit trips annually. This legislation gives us new author- ity and new funding to address the needs of those transit systems, to pro-tect them against attacks, reduce their vulnerability and improve the security of passengers. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I yield my- self 3 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I would have liked to have come to the floor and supported this bill. However, the more I learn VerDate Aug 31 2005 01:38 Mar 28, H3108 March 27, 2007 about some of the provisions of the manager 's amendment that will be of- fered, the more I learn about some of the special interest provisions that have been put in this bill in the name of some special interest, as opposed to national security, I find myself in-clined to vote against the measure and final passage, if it continues as it is now crafted. First of all, I truly believe that the security grants that are provided for under the provisions of this legislation will not prevent terrorist attacks. This isn't always a question, as I said ear- lier on the rule, of how much money we spend. I have no problem as a Member of Congress spending money on rail and transit security. It is how we effec-tively spend that money. This bill is not going to prevent a Madrid, where cell phones and backpacks were used. This is not going to prevent a London, where clean, un-known suicide bombers exercised their will and slaughtered many people, both aboveground and underground. I was there just weeks before and saw some of the measures that they put in place. Now they were nice surveillance measures, but we can 't make the same mistakes. If we want to stop terrorism, we are going to have to penetrate the organizations, the finances and the communications of individuals that are willing to take their own lives and oth-ers. This bill is not going to, as it is crafted, provide that. The other thing that was prohibited from both the Homeland Security Com-mittee and the T&I Committee was the ability to amend this. As we saw this product developing, we did not put in a needs assessment or risk assessment, which has never been done for rail or transit security, so we don 't know where to spend the money. We heard some of the Members say- ing we are going to have 600 inspectors. Do we need those 600 inspectors? Some-one else said we are going to make these grants available to unions. Is that the best interest or is that serving some special interest? So I have grown to have some very serious concerns about the provisions of this legislation. And the American Association of Railroads has said that, in fact, this is going to dismantle safe-ty and security as we know it under ex-isting law with the preemption clause that has been provided here. So from State to State under the pro- visions of the way this manager 's amendment is crafted, the regulations will vary. Can you imagine a train going from jurisdiction to jurisdiction under those circumstances? Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlelady from Florida, the Chair of the Rail Sub-committee. Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. I want to thank Chairmen O BERSTAR and THOMPSON for working together to bring this important legislation to the floor. For too long, we have neglected the security of our rail and transit system, and this legislation will go a long way to make up for this. March 11 marked the third anniver- sary of the train bombing in Madrid, where 191 people were killed and 2,050 were injured. Since that terrible ter-rorist attack, additional bombings have occurred in London and India, killing hundreds more people. It is ob-vious that we must be ready for a simi-lar attack here in our own country, but, sadly, we are not. Mr. Chairman, each year more Amer- icans ride on rail and transit systems than they do on planes, yet the money we are putting in security is a mere fraction of what we devote to aviation security. In 2006, the Federal Govern-ment spent $4.7 billion for airline secu-rity, yet only $136 million for rail and transit systems. Five times more peo-ple take trains over planes each day, yet we spend 35 times more on aviation security than we do on rail and transit security. This is not acceptable. Chairman D EFAZIO and I recently held a hearing on rail and transit secu-rity, and what we found was discour-aging. Since 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security has failed to issue a strategy to secure our rail and transit infrastructure, and the Transportation Security Administration has not com-pleted a risk assessment of these sys-tems. Additionally, the rash of inter- national terrorist bombings means that terrorists are getting smarter. Their future attacks will be harder to prevent. The window to secure our rail and transit infrastructure is closing quickly, and we need to act. While the Department of Transportation has done the most work of all agencies to secure this segment, it is obvious that much more work needs to be done. I am glad that the manager 's amend- ment will require DHS to work with the DOT to improve our Nation 's rail and transit security system. It is hard to believe that almost 6 years after 9/11 we still have not addressed the rail and transit security. But election brings changes, and I am glad that we, the new congressional leadership, have common sense to take steps to protect the millions of people who use our Na-tion's many rail and transit systems. The legislation on the floor today takes important steps to address our Nation 's rail and transit security. This bill requires comprehensive security plans, strengthens whistleblower pro-tection for workers, mandates security training, improves communications and intelligence sharing, authorizes a high level of grant funding for Amtrak, the freight railroads and public transit providers, and provides funding for safety improvements to the tunnels in New York, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Most importantly, it ensures our communities, first responders, transit and rail workers have the resources they need to keep their systems safe and secure; and it does it through a co- ordinated effort between the Homeland Security and the Department of Trans-portation. While we may lag behind other coun- tries' efforts to protect transit and rail workers, I am glad that our new con-gressional leadership is taking steps to correct this problem. H.R. 1401 will go a long way to pro- tect our Nation 's millions of transit and rail passengers, while protecting the communities they travel through and keeping the trains running on time. I encourage my colleagues to safe- guard their constituents and support this long-overdue rail and security leg-islation. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the Re-publican leader on the Railroads, Pipe-lines and Hazardous Materials Sub-committee, the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. S HUSTER ). Mr. SHUSTER. I appreciate the gen- tleman yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, I rise with great con- cern and in opposition to H.R. 1401. I think there are many provisions in this bill that are positive, that will en-hance security, but I am concerned about the strategy as we move forward. Do we have one to move forward, spending billions of dollars? In addition, there are a couple of pro- visions in this bill, section 124, which would require carriers to ship along the most secure routes. That sounds good, but when you put in there shipping along these routes without concern for safety, you may decide that when you look at what may be to some secure, you have serious safety considerations, whether the track is safe or what the weather is going to be like, and what is the first responder capabilities? Those are things that we have to consider when we are deciding on which route to take different shipments. Also, the background checks. Section 120, I believe, weakens the background checks and it appears to me may pres-sure private industry to hire people, hire felons that we don 't want working on the rail system that could further jeopardize our security. The whistleblower protection. I be- lieve it already affords adequate whis-tleblower protection for our workers. Keeping it under its current law under the Federal Rail Administration I be-lieve is much better than moving it over to the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor hasn 't had the ex- perience in working with rail and rail labor, where the FRA has great experi-ence. So I think we need to leave it there instead of moving it to an agency that, as I said, has no experience. Most importantly, I rise today to op- pose the manager 's amendment. For decades, the Federal policy has given the U.S. Department of Transportation preeminent jurisdiction over rail safe-ty under the Federal Railroad Safety Act. Section 3 of the manager 's amend- ment would destroy that Federal pre-emption. VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:29 Mar March 27, 2007 b1545 Under current law, States may enact safety laws as long as they address unique local safety hazards. As I said, section 3 of the manager 's amendment will change all of that. This would balkanize our rail system and subject railroads to a hodgepodge of State and local regulations. Rail-roads could face different rules every time they crossed a State or county or municipal border. Imagine, 50 States, 50 different jurisdictions, or more, when you talk about the different counties in America. And they could regulate on braking systems, the num-ber of people on the trains, and the types of trains that we use or the tracks we use. In fact, in California there are proposals out there that they want to change the track standards, they want to change the types of loco-motives. This is going to destroy the effi- ciency of the national rail system that we have created, a successful one over 20 or so years. And I repeat, this is not a security issue. It does not belong in this bill. And I hope the chairman of the full committee joins me in oppos-ing this manager 's amendment because rail safety belongs in a rail safety bill, which the subcommittee is going to take up. So I urge my colleagues to op-pose the manager 's amendment. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield at this time 3 minutes to the previous Chair of the Rail Sub-committee and current ranking Repub-lican leader of the Coast Guard Sub-committee of the House of Representa-tives, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. L ATOURETTE ). Mr. L ATOURETTE. I thank the chairman, and I thank Ranking Mem-ber M ICAfor yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee for bringing this important legislation to the floor. As Mr. S HUSTER indicated, there are some good provisions in the bill that will improve our Nation 's rail network and the flow of freight and passengers using that. However, there is something very troubling in the manager 's amendment which will be discussed soon. Without careful consideration, there is a provision in the manager 's amend- ment that could be detrimental to any-body who wants to ship anything on rail in this country or any passenger who wants to ride on Amtrak. Unfortunately, section 3 of the man- ager's amendment is crippling to the bill. This section will undermine the efforts of the U.S. Department of Transportation and FRA 's efforts to create a sound national safety policy. As Mr. S HUSTER indicated, for decades the preeminent jurisdiction has been maintained by DOT. Section 3 destroys that Federal preemption. Under current law, States can enact safety laws as long as they address the unique local safety hazard. The amend-ment before us will change that and will allow States to effectively over- ride Federal policies. With this amend-ment, the railroads could have 50 dif-ferent sets of local laws to follow, and Federal law would no longer provide the blanket policy for the carriers to follow. A few of the things that we look at on the Transportation and Infrastruc-ture Committee is how DOT and FRA are doing with the implementation of our laws and regulations relating to the safety and security of the Nation 's railroad. In addition, as a committee we also look into issues such as capac-ity on railroad network, and how effi-ciently and effectively the network is working for the freight passengers using the network. Because this provision has been in- serted into the manager 's amendment without the benefit of bipartisan testi-mony and hearings, the catastrophic consequences of such provision have not been debated or considered, in my opinion, in regular order. I call for reg-ular order today, Mr. Chairman. I know that the chairman of our full com-mittee and the ranking member of our full committee are thoughtful Mem-bers, deliberative when it comes to our Nation 's transportation laws. This pro- vision severely cripples the good work of our committee, in my opinion, the good work of DOT, and FRA. We should not make radical changes to the law without careful bipartisan consider-ation. The consequences that has not occurred. I would indicate that Chairwoman B ROWN has had a hearing. And I know the gentleman from North Dakota is preparing to speak on the horrible events that occurred in Minot, North Dakota. We also had the benefit of what used to be the American Trial Lawyers Association. I think in the greatest PR stunt in the universe they are now the American Association for Justice; they are no longer the Trial Lawyers. I think that the gentleman 's concern can be addressed without throwing out the Federal preemption, and I am sad-dened that the manager 's amendment does that, and I hope my colleagues will oppose the manager 's amendment because of section 3. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, could I in- quire as to the time remaining. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gen- tleman from Florida has 1 12minutes, and the gentleman from Minnesota has 4 minutes. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes and yield to the distinguished gentleman from North Dakota. Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage the chairman in a colloquy and thank the gentleman for yielding. Chairman O BERSTAR , I rise to discuss an issue that is of critical importance to my district. At 1:39 a.m. on January 18, 2002, a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train derailed in Minot, North Dakota. The freight train derailed 31 freight cars, including 15 cars con-taining anhydrous ammonia. As a re- sult of this accident, the people of Minot were exposed to the largest cata-strophic release of anhydrous ammonia in U.S. history. They were not at fault. They were sitting ducks in their own homes. After the area cleared, one indi- vidual, John Grabinger, had died, and many, many others suffered injuries, including individuals who sustained second degree burns to their skin. And many others are still suffering from long-term permanent physical damage. Some courts are ignoring congres- sional intent and denying Americans grievously injured in railroad accidents their rights under State law, even when it is undisputed that the cause of the accident was the railroad 's wrong- doing. By preempting State law, these courts are leaving injured North Dako-tans and others with no remedy at all, since the Federal Railroad Safety Act itself does not provide a remedy or cause of action for victims. I just want to clarify with the chair- man the intent of the language found in section 3 on the first page of the manager 's amendment. Is it correct that this legislation clarifies that the Federal Rail Safety Act of 1970 does not and was never intended to preempt State law claims for damages? Mr. OBERSTAR. That is correct. This clarifying language comes in large part as a response to court opinions that have misapplied principles of Fed-eral preemption which has prevented people injured by the negligent acts of railroads from being compensated. The bill does not change any of the current law, but only adds to it to clarify the meaning of what is already in public law. Mr. POMEROY. It is my under- standing that until 1993, there was no question that State causes of actions were not preempted. The Supreme Court then said they could be, under some circumstances, and some courts since then have been broadening the railroads ' immunity from liability under the auspices of preemption. Con-gress tried before to change the FRSA 's preemptive scope, but courts didn't listen. Does this language reflect the fact that Congress never intended preemption of State causes of action? Mr. OBERSTAR. That is correct. Mr. POMEROY. While the bill accu- rately clarifies that State causes of ac-tion are not preempted, will you con-tinue to work with us to take the steps necessary to ensure that courts con-strue this amendment only as a clari-fication of Congress ' original intent? Mr. OBERSTAR. We will pursue this issue in future hearings of the sub-committee of relevance. Mr. POMEROY. Is it also your under- standing that the same Federal court that dismissed those claims urged the Congress to remedy this situation and the language in section 3 does precisely what the court said needed to be done? VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:30 Mar H3110 March 27, 2007 Mr. OBERSTAR. The situation that needs to be cured is not that the stat-ute preempts negligence claims re-quires a change. The situation needing remedy is the misinterpretation of the statute by some courts. That is pre-cisely what this clarifying language is intended to accomplish. This matter will be further reviewed as we proceed with reauthorization of the Federal Rail Safety Act in our Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and I would look forward to continuing to work with the gentleman from North Dakota, the Chair of the sub-committee, and ranking member of the subcommittee to address the judicial interpretation. Mr. POMEROY. I thank the chair- man. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I yield my- self the balance of my time. I wish I could have come to the floor today and supported this measure, be-cause rail and transit security are ex-tremely important and it is one of our most important responsibilities as rep-resentatives of the people. People are working hard, trying to make a living, raise their families. They send us here to know the facts. And I can tell you, the facts are that this bill was done in haste, particularly the manager 's amendment. It is a great example for the House of Representatives and the majority, the new majority and the mi-nority. Because when you subvert and do not conduct yourself in the process that the Founding Fathers had envi-sioned, a bipartisan approach to crafting legislation, you get yourself tied up in these little knots. Now they are finding flaws in this legislation left and right, deregulating State traffic and railroads. They are scurrying around trying to figure out how are we going to fix this. This is not the way to do the people 's business, particularly on an important issue like security. So I will go home and tell people why I voted against this. Many others can go home and say, I voted $7 billion or $8 billion of your money for rail and transit security. But what did it do? Unfortunately, it didn't do the job we need to do in the situation we find ourselves in with ter-rorist threats and what we have seen in the rest of the world. We are abdicating our responsibility. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, we have worked very vigorously in our committee over decades to achieve the bipartisanship, and we have done so. But I think the gentleman is a little misguided in his recitation of history, because there were the Federalists and the Democrats at the outset and they didn't do much bipartisanship at the beginning of this Congress of ours. I just refer to section 3 of the man- ager's amendment, line 2: No Preemp- tion of State Law. Nothing in section 20106 of title 49 U.S. Code preempts a State cause of action, or any damages recoverable in such an action, et cetera. So, in fact, the preemptive lan-guage specifically recognizes that ex-isting law preempts positive laws, reg- ulation, or orders by executive or legis-lative branch officials, expressly ad-dress railroad safety or security. And, not to be concerned, we will address the broader issue as we go forward with the rail safety authorization. Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1401, The Rail and Public Transportation Se-curity Act of 2007, of which I am an original cosponsor. This legislation will make long overdue security improvements to the rail, transit, and surface transportation systems in our nation. In the last 80 years there have been over 900 attacks on public transportation systems around the world. In recent history, the horrific attacks in Madrid, London, and Mumbai have been unfortunate reminders that we must do more to secure our Nation 's transportation systems. For too long, our country has not done enough to improve the security of our transportation systems. In fact President Bush 's fiscal year 2007 budget proposal in- cluded $41.4 million in the Transportation Se-curity Administration budget for surface trans-portation security, less than 1 percent of the TSA budget. Clearly the past level of funding has been inadequate to address the security of the surface transportation system. I am very pleased that H.R. 1401 authorizes three grant programs that will make more funds available to enhance the security of rail, public transpor-tation and over-the-road systems. The Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 requires rail and public transpor-tation systems to submit vulnerability assess-ments and security plans to the Department of Homeland Security. Each system is then placed into a risk tier, those in medium and high risk tiers have to have Department of Homeland Security approval for their security plans. Each transportation system will then employ security measures to address the type and degree of risk they face. This approach will help increase the security of our transpor-tation systems, while allowing them the flexi-bility to adopt measures that meet their needs. I am particularly pleased that the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 re-quires that rail and public transportation sys-tems provide their employees with adequate training. This training requirement will enable employees to respond efficiently to prevent potential terrorist attacks and to minimize the damage and loss of life if an attack does occur. I am also pleased that this legislation establishes a rail and public transportation se-curity exercise program so that systems can practice and perfect their responses to poten-tial attacks. I urge my colleagues to support this impor- tant legislation. Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bill. As events over the last several years have shown, we ignore rail and transit security at our peril. Since 2004, terrorist cells have con-ducted successful and deadly bombings on major passenger rail systems in Spain (2004), the United Kingdom (2005), and India (2006), with 450 people killed and 2,800 wounded. We know al Qaeda and like-minded groups desire to repeat such attacks here in America. We also know that our rail and transit systems need more money to help deter such threats. For example, the American Public Transpor- tation Association (APTA) estimates that since 9/11, our government has invested $7.53 in aviation security improvements per passenger boarding, but only $0.008 (less than one penny) in public transportation security im-provements per passenger boarding. This se-curity investment disparity has been allowed to persist for years, despite the fact that every weekday, more than 14 million people use public transportation, and more than 25 million passengers ride Amtrak each year. In New Jersey alone, NJ Transit \u2014the third largest statewide transit agency \u2014has stated that it has only 220 police officers to protect 400,000 customers per day (265,000 bus and 135,000 rail), 10,500 employees at multiple lo-cations, 800 trains on more than 1,000 miles of track, 161 rail stations, and 49 light rail sta-tions. Additionally, these same officers must protect and secure more than 2,000 buses that use more than 20,800 bus stops. In 2004, the APTA outlined $6 billion in needs for transit agency security-related in-vestments. A 2002 Government Accountability Office study of just eight transit systems that had completed security assessments found that needed upgrades would cost at least $700 million. The Congress took a positive step last year when it raised rail and transit security funding from $150 million to $175 million. However, if we are to prevent the tragedies that occurred in Madrid, London, and Mumbai from being re-peated in America, we must act now to ensure that our local transit providers have the re-sources they need to protect the millions of Americans who rely on rail service. Fortu-nately, Congress is now taking additional steps to address this problem. The bill before us today authorizes three separate security grant programs: one each for rail security, public transportation security, and over-the-road bus security. More than $5.8 billion would be authorized for these grants through 2011. If fully funded, these pro-grams would help us close major security gaps in our rail and transit systems. Similar grant programs for firefighters and other first responders have helped local jurisdictions \u2014in- cluding several in my own district \u2014to upgrade their response capabilities. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure the money to support these new grant programs is there from day one. Additionally, this bill mandates a range of additional measures designed to improve rail and transit security, including vulnerability as-sessments and regular security exercises to test the ability of rail and transit systems to spot and defeat potential threats to the trav-eling public. One of the chief lessons of the Hurricane Katrina debacle is that Federal, State, and local governments, along with the relevant private sector partners, must regularly test our collective response system to detect and fix problems before a real incident occurs. Regular exercises and the lessons learned from them must be implemented in a timely fashion. Creating a system that institutional-izes such a process is vital. Mr. Chairman, I 'm pleased we 're finally be- ginning to address our rail and transit security needs in a systematic way, and I urge my col-leagues to support passage of this bill. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. This bill calls for necessary funding and emergency VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:29 Mar 28, H3111 March 27, 2007 planning to protect the American rail system and other critical points of our Nation 's infra- structure. I support H.R. 1401 because I have seen the chaos that can ensue when a disaster oc-curs. I was in New York City on 9/11, and I saw firsthand what can happen when we are improperly prepared for a terrorist attack or natural disaster. The entire world saw in New Orleans that without planning and foresight, the aftermath a disaster can be even worse than the disaster itself. This bill will require a national plan to prepare for rail and public transportation emergencies. This bill will also provide grant funding dedi- cated to rail and public transportation security. Included in these grants will be $100 million over the next 4 years to improve security in six New York City tunnels. Anybody who has traveled through these tunnels, as much as I have, will know this funding is critical. In addition to providing direct funding for emergency prevention, this bill will require training programs to teach employees of pub-lic transportation systems how to prevent and prepare for a terrorist attack, and how to re-spond to such an attack. And it will go further, by establishing programs which will test how well the transportation systems have prepared for such an attack. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1401 is a wide ranging bill that touches on a number of critical infra-structure points in the United States. For ex-ample, currently our Nation has only 100 sur-face transportation inspectors. This bill will in-crease that number to 600 over the next 3 years. In addition to providing grants for localities to secure their infrastructure, this bill will help prevent attacks that we haven 't even thought of yet. $200 million in this bill will go towards research and development that is intended to plan for and prevent terrorist attacks. Mr. Chairman, millions of Americans from coast to coast rely upon public transportation every day. Our people deserve as much safe-ty as we can provide for them. We cannot pre-dict when a terrorist attack or natural disaster will occur, and we cannot always prevent these from happening. However, we have also seen that the better prepared we are, and the more we have planned, the better we can ad-dress these problems. H.R. 1401 will go a long way towards helping us minimize the im-pact of a terrible disaster. I strongly support it and urge my colleagues to offer their support as well. Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to discuss H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. Securing our Nation 's rail and public trans- portation systems has long been a priority for the Homeland Security Committee. However, many different competing priorities elbowed this issue out of the way as we faced growing concern about border and port secu-rity. Our Committee addressed these issues head-on under the leadership of Ranking Member \u2014then Chairman \u2014P ETER KING, and made great strides in securing our homeland. However, attacks in London and Madrid are stark illustrations of the urgency with which Congress must address rail and mass transit security. H.R. 1401 requires transportation providers to conduct vulnerability assessments and im-plement security plans. The bill also mandates security training for transportation workers. These steps are crucial in bringing rail and mass transit security up to par to the level of airports and seaports. I also appreciate that our Committee adopt- ed several amendments I offered during our makrup. Transportation workers will now have to un- dergo a background check that will look at both criminal history and current immigration status. We cannot afford to give criminals and ter- rorists the access to our secure sites. The American people do not understand or accept such a risk, and nor do I. My other amendment specified that some of the new training exercises take place at the border. We have all heard rumblings over the last few years about criminal gang activity, particu-larly along the Southern border. It makes sense to have a portion of training dedicated to an area with a high risk. However, I must express my disappointment that the Rules Committee did not make in order my amendment to better secure sen-sitive information from Freedom of Information Act Requests. I fear without this additional language, secu- rity plans and risk assessment criteria could easily fall into the wrong hands. Further, I have grave concerns about the amount of money we are spending in the bill without these protections. The American people would not thank us for all of our work in airports or seaports if some-thing happens to a major rail or subway car-rier. I want to thank Chairman T HOMPSON and Ranking Member K INGfor their tireless work on this bill and for working with me on my amendments. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I 'd like to congratulate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for producing bipartisan leg-islation to address the security weaknesses in our rail and mass transit systems and to en-sure that strong whistleblower protections are provided to our front-line rail and mass transit security workers. One area that has been largely overlooked since September 11th is the security associ-ated with shipments of extremely hazardous materials on the roads and railways of our country. Every day tank cars pass through our urban centers carrying enough chlorine to kill 100,000 people in half an hour. Some of these shipments must travel the routes they are cur-rently using. But others could easily be safely re-routed to avoid population centers and other sensitive areas. We already know that these chemicals are attractive terrorist targets. Just a few weeks ago, several deadly attacks in Iraq involved improvised explosive devices that included canisters of deadly chlorine gas, and a planned attack involving a truck full of chlorine was foiled this past weekend. The risk is not just an overseas risk either. Several years ago, an Ohio-based al Qaeda operative was arrested and pled guilty for plot-ting to collapse a bridge in New York City or derail a train in DC. Earlier this year, reporter Carl Prine at the Pittsburgh Tribune wrote a scathing expose on the state of rail insecurity in our country. He was able to walk right into rail yards with tank- er cars containing some of the deadliest chemicals on earth. No one stopped him \u2014he had no problem getting his hands on these deadly chemical tanks. We're lucky that \u2014this time \u2014it was a jour- nalist and not a jihadist who penetrated these rail yards. Whether it 's an accident or an al Qaeda at- tack, we need to make the shipments of dead-ly chemicals more secure. The language in this bill that I authored and that was agreed to on a bipartisan basis builds upon the recent Notices of Proposed Rule-making issued by the Department of Transpor-tation and the TSA. It requires rail carriers to analyze the routes and storage facilities for security sensitive ma-terials as part of the security plans that they must submit for approval to the Department of Homeland Security. Then it requires the rail carriers to select the route and storage facili-ties that best reduce the risk and con-sequences of a terrorist attack on a shipment of these materials as they travel through or near high threat urban areas and other areas that DHS thinks need special security protec-tions. The language in this bill doesn 't apply to all hazardous materials \u2014just the ones that pose the greatest threat, such as chlorine or pro-pane. Most assessments put this at less than 1 percent of all shipments. This bill also doesn 't require re-routing to occur if there is no practical alternative route. Rail carriers will only be required to re-route when a more secure route is available. I urge my colleagues to join me in this bi- partisan effort. Now is the time to upgrade the security for these toxic shipments so none of our constituents are ever exposed to a cata-strophic chemical release simply because we failed to take these simple steps.

The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 270, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. T HOMPSON ) and a Member opposed will each control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, before I begin, I ask unani-mous consent that the amendment be modified with the text I have placed at the desk. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there ob- jection to the modification? Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the right to object. Mr. Chairman, I am not sure of the provisions of the offering that have been made by the gentleman. I was wondering if I could inquire as to the content of his modification. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Actu- ally, Mr. Chairman, it was a drafting error on the whistleblower proceedings. And if you would look at it, it clearly was Legislative Counsel 's error, and we are really just trying to correct the language. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield for further inquiry? Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I yield to the gentleman from Florida. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that in fact the way that the amendment is now drawn, the original Thompson amendment offered as amendment No. 1 was in fact flawed and that this would correct that flaw; and the intent that is in the Thompson amendment that would be of a negative impact would be removed by the cor-rection that you are now offering. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I understand that Mr. D AVIS, as well as Mr. W AXMAN , are in agreement with the correction, because it is really the language from their whistleblower bill that we are trying to make sure that is consistent with what we have. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from Florida withdraw his reservation? Mr. MICA. I do have a reservation. I will have to object. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Objection is heard. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi. b1600 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, as I noted earlier, H.R. 1401 is an important milestone in protecting our Nation 's rail and public transportation systems. Since its introduction, however, Chairman O BERSTAR and Chairman WAXMAN have worked with me to im- prove the bill and satisfy a number of concerns they had. I am proud that my colleagues and I were able to put aside jurisdictional squabbles that plagued our committees in the past two Con-gresses. By working together, we came up with compromise language that is good for the Nation and good for Con-gress. I want to thank Chairman W AXMAN for the assistance he and his staff gave me on improving whistleblower protec-tions for transportation workers. The manager 's amendment strengthens the protections for Federal employees and contractors. As revised, the protections more closely resemble those found in H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection En-hancement Act. Members may recall that H.R. 985 overwhelmingly passed the House 2 weeks ago. I also have worked closely with Chairman O BERSTAR to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the Depart-ments of Homeland Security and Transportation under this bill. The two agencies will have the same respon-sibilities established in the various laws, executive orders, and MOUs al-ready governing their relationship. Additionally, in order to improve ef- ficiency, we will create a new relation-ship between the Departments to man-age the rail, public transportation, and bus security grants created by this bill. For all three grants, the Homeland Se-curity Department will be responsible for determining the requirements for recipients of grants, including applica-tion requirements; determining who re-ceives the grants; determining the uses for the grant funds; and establishing priorities for uses of funds. Transportation will be responsible for distributing grant funds to those recipients as directed by Homeland Se-curity. Both agencies will jointly mon-itor and audit the use of grant funds. I believe that this cooperative rela- tionship will create efficiencies. Allow-ing Transportation to be the ''Western Union '' for grants is consistent with the recommendation of the American Public Transportation Association. I am proud to have worked side by side with Chairman O BERSTAR to en- sure that our Nation 's security needs are met in an efficient and effective manner. Since its creation in the 108th Con- gress, the Committee on Homeland Se-curity has had to compete with other committees just to get things done. Good bills were stalled or held up too long because of jurisdictional squab-bles. Not this Congress. I thank Chair-man O BERSTAR for his help. By working together, I think we can demonstrate that the 110th Congress is a do-some-thing Congress, not a Congress of com-peting jurisdictions. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment and make this a Con-gress that acts to better protect our rail and public transportation system. Mr. Chairman, I enter the following for pur- poses of explaining my request for unanimous consent to correct a technical drafting error that resulted in the omission from the Man-ager's Amendment of two sections clearly ref- erenced throughout the Manager 's Amend- ment, specifically referred to below as sections 112A and 112B. The two sections listed below are not es- sential to making this section of the underlying bill operative, but, while the bill and section are still operational, the bill would be further clarified if the following sections were in-cluded. I am disappointed that my unanimous consent request was objected to, apparently for mere partisan advantage. As such, at con-ference, I plan to work with Chairman W AXMAN of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to offer this language as it rep-resents a compromise between myself and Chairman W AXMAN . I worked with Chairman WAXMAN to make the provisions of H.R. 1401 similar to those in H.R. 985, which is the bi-partisan whistleblower protection bill that over-whelmingly passed the House on March 14. Below is the technical amendment that should have been made today: VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:30 Mar 27, 2007 SEC. 112A. WHISTLEBLOWER PROVISIONS RELAT- ING TO CERTAIN FEDERAL EMPLOY-EES.

The first basic reason is, when the original legislation was passed out of our committee, we would have had funding going directly to police agen-cies, the police departments who actu-ally do security work. Now the money will have to go through the carriers, and the police will have to seek reim-bursement from them. This is an added level of bureaucracy we don 't need. It will impede a well-coordinated and structured security response. For that reason alone, I have to oppose it. Also, by having a bifurcated rent dis- tribution system between DOT and DHS, to me this goes against the letter and the spirit of the 9/11 Commission. For those basic reasons, I reluctantly oppose the manager 's amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the ranking member of the Transportation Com-mittee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M ICA). Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman and Mem- bers of the House, again, I wish that this bill could truly have been crafted in a bipartisan manner. I have to speak against the man- ager's amendment because the sponsor of the manager 's amendment just stood and admitted to a flaw that is in the bill. Again, this is a lesson to all of us that if we craft these pieces of impor-tant legislation, we put partisan poli-tics aside. This isn 't the place for par- tisan politics. This is a national secu-rity issue critical to the survival of our people. If we put those aside and we work together on this, we wouldn 't find ourselves tied in this little legislative knot that they are trying to figure out: Should we pass this flawed manager 's amendment? The bad news is that the flawed pro- vision in section 3 of the manager 's amendment allows every State to ef-fectively override safety rules. That is the great part of this system, that the minority and the majority work to-gether and craft legislation and we find some flaws and make some improve-ments, and we were denied that. The T&I side was denied even one amend-ment. That is why I opposed the rule, and that is why I am going to oppose the manager 's amendment, and that is why I am going to oppose this bill. I will go back and tell folks in my district, I did not vote for this, and it was $7 billion, not because I didn 't want to provide security, but I wanted to make sure that their hard-earned VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:30 Mar H3128 March 27, 2007 money was well spent and we didn 't pass in an arbitrary fashion, ignore the rights of the majority and the minor-ity, legislation that would benefit this country, especially in the situation we find ourselves with the terrorist threats we have seen. We don 't want a Madrid or a London, but I don 't want politics to override what should be good legislation. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. L ATOURETTE ). Mr. L ATOURETTE. How much time is left, Mr. Chairman? The Acting CHAIRMAN. Two min- utes. Mr. L ATOURETTE. I want to thank Mr. K INGfor yielding. I listened very carefully to the col- loquy between someone I have the greatest respect for in the entire Con-gress, Chairman O BERSTAR , and the gentleman from North Dakota. We had the gentleman from North Dakota and some of his constituents and people from the American Association for Jus-tice before the committee. I happen to believe that anybody who is injured as a result of fault by an-other person should have his or her day in court and should be compensated when that is required. But the problem we have with section 3, section 3 undoes decades of Federal preemption when safety matters are concerned on the Nation 's railroads, and the situa- tion that we are going to find ourselves in is the one that Mr. S HUSTER de- scribed: States will be free to pass 50 different sets of safety regulations, and trains are going to have to stop at the border and comply with this, that or the other thing. If section 3 simply said what hap- pened in Minot, North Dakota, is hor-rible and those people should have their day in court to have the ability to seek compensation, I would be the first one to support it. I am afraid, however, and with as much respect as I have for the chair-man of the committee, Mr. O BERSTAR , when the title of the document, section 3, is ''No Preemption of State Law '' it is going to have an unintended con-sequence. It is going to undo the fabric of our Nation 's rail system. I think for that reason alone, notwithstanding whatever Mr. M ICAhad to say, for that reason alone, we should have come to-gether in a bipartisan way, recognizing the strengthens of both the Homeland Security and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and gotten this right. This, in my opinion, is a ham-handed approach that should be defeated. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close at this time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the chairman of the Transpor-tation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. O BERSTAR . The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gen- tleman from Minnesota is recognized for 90 seconds. Mr. OBERSTAR. Again, I want to ex- press my great appreciation to the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee with whom I have worked very diligently and cooperatively. He is a man of great personal integrity and legislative honor and has worked vigor-ously to produce a splendid rail and public transportation security bill. There has been some discussion about how the grants will be adminis-tered. We had testimony before our committee from the Nation 's transit agencies and through their national or-ganization. The American Public Tran-sit Association told our committee they prefer to work with the DOT and Federal Transit Administration and grant administration. They have had experience with them. FTA knows the operational aspect of transit. They know the security side of transit. They can combine the two with less com-plexity and more efficiency than the Department of Homeland Security, which is just getting started, with a huge new bureaucracy, as we have learned, with over 206,000 people. So that part is working well and will work well in the language that we have agreed upon. Again, let me just come back to the preemption issue. Read the words, be-lieve the words, ''no preemption of State law. '' That 's what it says. That 's what it means. I strongly support the manager 's amendment. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chair- man, I want to call to your attention a problem which has been slowly developing based on recent court cases, and why it is necessary for Congress to rectify the situation. Courts are ig-noring congressional intent and leaving Ameri-cans injured by the negligence of the railroads without any remedies. The Federal Rail Safety Act (FRSA) was en- acted in 1970 to create a system of minimum safety standards to improve railroad safety and reduce accidents. Congress intended for these federal standards to be a floor, and ex-pressly granted states the authority to pass stronger safety laws. Now some courts are ignoring congressional intent and denying Americans grievously in-jured in railroad accidents their rights under state law, even when it is undisputed that the cause of the accident was the railroad 's wrongdoing. By preempting state law, these courts are leaving injured Americans with no remedy at all \u2014since FRSA itself does not pro- vide a remedy or cause of action for victims. The residents of Minot, North Dakota and others similarly injured should have their day in court. One only needs to look at the tragedy in Minot, North Dakota to see the impact of these court decisions on real people. On Jan-uary 31, 2002, 31 railroad cars derailed near the city of Minot, North Dakota, releasing over 200,000 gallons of the deadly gas, anhydrous ammonia. The dense cloud of toxic fumes en-gulfed the town of Minot causing one death and injuring hundreds of people. If this tragedy had happened in a big city or even in the mid-dle of the day (instead of 2:00 a.m.) countless more people would be killed or injured. Among the various causes of the derailment was the failure of a so-called temporary joint bar that had been left in this substandard track for over 20 months. In addition, the track itself was old, worn out and poorly maintained \u2014not even meeting the minimum standards under FRSA. The Canadian Pacific Railroad admit-ted that it was responsible for the derailment, but argued that it could not be held account-able because FRSA preempted state law claims. The federal court dismissed the claims brought under state law on the basis of federal preemption, admitting that ''such a result is unduly harsh and leaves the Plaintiffs no rem-edy for this tragic accident. '' Mehl v. Canadian Pacific Railway , 417 F. Supp. 2d 1104, 1120 (D.N.D. 2006). Unfortunately, this isn 't a problem limited to one court. Court decisions in Minnesota and Massachusetts have left victims of negligence with no recourse for their injuries. See, e.g., Kalan Enterprises, LLC v BNSF Railway Co. , 415 F. Supp. 2d 977 (D. Minn. 2006); Ouellette v. Union Tank Car Co ., 902 F. Supp. 5 (D. Mass 1995). Congress mut act now before more Ameri- cans lose their right to a remedy, and that is why we have chosen to add technical lan- guage to the Rail Security bill to alleviate this problem on a timely basis. Over 200 claims pending in Minnesota state court have been removed to federal court by Canadian Pacific. The railroad is arguing that all claims against it should be dismissed based on preemption under the FRSA. Oral argument on the rail-road's motion to dismiss has been scheduled for May 15th so it 's imperative to clarify that the FRSA does not preempt state remedies in order to prevent an additional travesty of jus-tice. The language would clarify that the purpose of the FRSA was and is to set uniform min-imum safety standards, and that an expansive application of preemption to deprive accident victims ' access to state remedies is a misapplication of the law. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The ques- tion is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. T HOMPSON ). The question was taken; and the Act- ing Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. L ATOURETTE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-ceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Mississippi will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . ARCURI The Acting CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 110 -74. Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 2 offered by Mr. A RCURI : At the end of title I, insert the following (and conform the table of contents accord-ingly): VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:29 Mar H3129 March 27, 2007 SEC. ll. ASSESSMENT AND REPORT. (a) S TUDY .\u2014The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation, shall assess the safety and security vulnerabilities of placing high voltage direct current elec-tric transmission lines along active railroad rights-of-way. In conducting the assessment, the Secretary shall, at a minimum, evaluate the risks to local inhabitants and to con-sumers of electric power transmitted by those lines, associated with a train collision or derailment that damages such electric transmission lines. (b) R EPORT .\u2014Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Sec-retary shall transmit the results of the as-sessment in subsection (a) to the appropriate congressional committees as defined in this Act. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 270, the gentleman from New York (Mr. A RCURI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. ARCURI asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act, would address an important issue sur-rounding our Nation 's efforts to expand electric power to major urban areas, and that is, of course, the safety issue. On the morning of March 12, 2007, a CSX freight train derailed approxi-mately 34 cars near Oneida, New York. Reports indicate there was an evacu-ation covering a 1-mile radius. Luck-ily, there were no reported deaths or injuries. However, a large fire occurred at the scene, and residents and emer-gency responders reported hearing sec-ondary explosions. CSX provided infor-mation that there were 40 tank cars carrying liquid petroleum gas in the train. What 's more, the derailment closed the New York State Thruway for several hours, requiring traffic to be detoured miles out of the way. Prior to this incident, there were 18 train derailments in western New York between January, 2005, and September, 2006, which further suggests the condi-tion of New York State 's freight rail- ways are in need of serious attention and repair. While this concern continues to trou- ble the people of New York, a private company is seeking to build a 190-mile high-voltage direct current trans-mission line from the town of Marcy in Oneida County, located in my district, to the town of New Windsor in Orange County in Mr. J OHNHALL's district. The company estimates that more than 90 percent of the proposed pri-mary and alternative routes will follow existing rights-of-way, both along rail-road tracks and natural gas lines. The transmission line would consist of 135- foot-tall towers and be operated with a rated power flow of 1,200 megawatts. A portion of the proposed route follows the New York Susquehanna & Western Railway right-of-way, which would run through some of the more heavily pop- ulated cities and towns in upstate New York. This is a situation where the consequences and risk are not only un-known but wholly unnecessary. b1615 For these reasons, my amendment to H.R. 1401 would require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation, to conduct an assessment of the safety and security vulnerabilities of placing high voltage direct current electric transmission lines along active rail-road rights-of-way. The assessment shall, at a minimum, evaluate the risks to local inhabitants and consumers of electric power trans-mitted by those lines, associated with a train collision or derailment that damages such electric transmission lines. It is no secret that as our cities con- tinue to grow they will need more en-ergy, and I fully support addressing that need; but meeting that need must be done in a safe and a responsible way. To this end, my amendment simply requires the Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation to take a hard look at our existing rail infra-structure and assess the security vulnerabilities so that we can avoid further electric power interruptions and preserve the safety of our constitu-ents. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I would claim the time in opposi-tion, even though I do not intend to op-pose the amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without ob- jection, the gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I would just say to the gentleman from New York, I commend him for his amendment and I appreciate his con-cerns. My only thought is that these seem to be primarily safety concerns, as opposed to security, and there are already so many reporting require-ments on the Department of Homeland Security that I am reluctant to request another report from the Department of Homeland Security. Having said that, as this legislation goes forward, I would just ask the gen-tleman to work with us as it goes to conference in the event that after speaking with the Secretary and the Department that they do consider this a burden and perhaps refine it. With that, I have no objection to it. I just would ask the gentleman if he would work with us as the process goes forward. Mr. ARCURI. If the gentleman would yield, I thank the gentleman, yes. Mr. KING of New York. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time we have remaining. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gen- tleman from New York (Mr. A RCURI ) has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 112minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. H ALL). Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I thank my colleague from New York for offering this important amendment. I am honored to speak in support of it. America 's railways and power lines are key critical infrastructure. So when proposals would locate them to-gether, it only makes sense for DHS and DOT to give them serious scrutiny. In the State of New York, the home- land security stakes are particularly high. Yet a private company continues to pursue eminent domain authority to install the massive New York Regional Interconnect along rail routes, through environmentally sensitive areas, and over the objections of local residents. In their hurry to get NYRI up and running, the company has pushed for-ward a plan that would put a 1,200 megawatt line on 135-foot towers near numerous rail lines. In western New York, there have been 19 derailments since 2005. The potential recipe for dis-aster is clear here. There is also a matter of precedent that this amendment would help to clarify. By passing this amendment, this body can say that in projects in New York and around the country that we will not endorse putting special for- profit eminent domain provisions above the security of our citizens, the sanctity of our environment or the rights of our landowners. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE). Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise to indicate that the committee majority supports Mr. A RCURI 's very thoughtful method to protect those individuals along those very difficult byways dealing with these particular power lines. Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, as I said, my amendment simply requires the Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation to take a hard look at our existing rail infrastructure and assess the security vulnerabilities so that we can avoid further electric power interruptions, while at the same time ensuring the health and safety of our citizens residing near high voltage power lines. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The ques- tion is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. A RCURI ). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . COHEN The Acting CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 110 -74. VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:30 Mar H3130 March 27, 2007 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 3 offered by Mr. C OHEN : At the end of title I, add the following: SEC. lllll . ALTERNATIVE MATERIAL SOURCES. The Secretary of Transportation, in con- sultation with the Secretary, shall establish a program to coordinate with State and local governments to minimize the need for trans-portation of toxic inhalation hazardous ma-terials by rail. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 270, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. C OHEN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as necessary to make this presentation. I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Trans-portation Security Act. My amend-ment would call for the Department of Transportation to coordinate with re-lated agencies as well as State and local governments to seek efforts that will minimize the transport of toxic in-halation hazardous materials. Never has the danger of transporting hazardous materials been more clear than in this post-9/11 age. While rail is clearly the safest means of transport for such materials, we must work to ensure this transit is as secure, effi-cient and is as considerate towards the safety of our communities as possible. The U.S. Naval Research Lab has said an attack on such a rail car could kill 100,000 people. Additionally, in 2005 testimony be- fore the Senate Committee on Home-land Security and Government Affairs, the administration 's deputy homeland security adviser at the time, Richard A. Falkenrath, told Congress in 2005 that ''toxic-by-inhalation industrial chemicals present a mass-casualty ter-rorist potential rivaled only by impro-vised nuclear devices, certain acts of bioterrorism, and the collapse of large, occupied buildings. '' Railroads carry 105,000 carloads of toxic chemicals a year and 1.6 million carloads of other hazardous materials such as explosives and radioactive items. In mid-January of this year, several train cars carrying flammable liquid derailed and exploded south of Louis-ville, Kentucky, shutting down a near-by highway and forcing evacuations of nearby homes, businesses and a school, according to local authorities. Two years earlier, a train crash in South Carolina caused a release of chlorine gas resulting in deaths, injuries, and forcing the evacuation of people from the surrounding areas. Most recently, there was a Union Pacific derailment of 28 cars in Henderson County, Texas. In the wake of these recent derailments, State and local officials nationwide have begun examining their regulatory authority over the trans- portation of hazardous materials by rail. Several localities nationwide have either introduced or enacted absolute bans on the transportation of certain toxic substances from trains that trav-el through their areas. This action has prompted litigation from the rail industry due to alleged violations of the U.S. Constitution 's commerce clause and Federal statutes concerning the transportation of haz-ardous materials. Rail companies fear such laws would force them to extend the travel of hazardous cargo by hun-dreds of miles around cities with the unintended effect of transferring the risk to other localities. This consensus amendment addresses the concerns of both rail companies and community advocates by seeking to cut the trans-port of these hazardous materials all together. In a June 2006 statement before the House Transportation and Infrastruc-ture Committee, the president and CEO of the Association of American Rail-roads made several recommendations intended to reduce the risks associated with the manufacture and transport of highly hazardous materials. Among these recommendations was ''exam- ining whether and how railroads can utilize coordinated routing arrange-ments to safely reduce hazmat trans-portation '' as well as ''examining whether hazmat consumers can source hazmat from closer suppliers. '' My amendment would simply call upon the Department of Transpor-tation to follow this recommendation by coordinating with localities to allow consumers to obtain TIH materials with the intended consequence of mini-mizing the time and frequency such materials are routed through our com-munities. Last July, the Memphis Commercial Appeal identified train cars carrying chlorine, 2-Dimethylaminoethyl acry-late, acetone cyanohydrin, nickel car-bonyl, and several other toxic inhala-tion hazard cargoes over a 2-day period in or near residential areas of Mem-phis. Not only hard to pronounce but very difficult to inhale I am sure of the things we would rather not inhale or pronounce. All of these chemicals are listed as potentially lethal if inhaled. City council members and other com- munity leaders in Memphis are calling on the Federal Government for assist-ance in deterring the transport of these materials through their residential areas. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to support this amendment and support this legis-lation and current efforts under way to improve the safety of our rail system. To further ensure the safety of our railways, as well as the local commu-nities they serve, I call upon my col-leagues to pass this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Who claims time in opposition? Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. Mr. Chairman, I do. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gen- tleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. Mr. Chairman, I understand the intent of the gentleman offering the amendment; but, unfortunately, upon reading it, it is obvious that this is a do-good amendment that either does nothing or does harm. The reason I say that is that the sub- ject the gentleman wishes to cover in this amendment is covered by the base bill already which will be retained if, in fact, we pass the manager 's amend- ment. Section 124 of the bill, pages 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90, take into effect what the gentleman is talking about. This is the Markey amendment which was worked out in committee on a bipar-tisan basis in some detail to work with the problem that you have, the secu-rity-sensitive materials, that encom-passes security-sensitive materials, which includes within its universe toxic inhalation hazardous materials. The issue is, what do we do with the fact that we need some of these prod-ucts as far as our society goes now but that they would also provide an oppor-tunity for terrorists to utilize them for damage to a particular community? So we crafted a very careful amendment that allows for consideration of the needs here on the economic side and the harm done. The way the gentleman has written his amendment, it requires the Sec-retary of Transportation to establish a program to minimize the need for transportation of toxic inhalation haz-ardous materials by rail only, by rail only. We looked at that requirement to have the Secretary come up with rules and regulations that were to take into consideration the total threat, the total need here. So by the gentleman 's own amendment, we may be required to minimize the travel on rail, which will maximize the travel on our high-ways. Now, I do not think the gen-tleman believes that necessarily makes it safer, or on our barges. This amendment, as drafted so nar- rowly, would require us to undercut much of what we have done in the base bill as a result of working on a bipar-tisan basis with Mr. M ARKEY in an area of concern that he has expressed often on the floor and in committee hearing after committee hearing. That is why I say either it does noth- ing and, therefore, is harmless or if, in fact, it does something, and there is mandatory language in here requiring the Secretary of Transportation, he shall establish such a program, re-quires him to move in only one direc-tion which may, in fact, make it more dangerous overall. One of the things we learned in our hearings was that you have to consider the entirety of the threat out there, the entirety of the universe of possible options. The gentleman denies the Sec-retary to do that by requiring that it minimize the transit of toxic inhala-tion hazardous materials by rail only, VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:29 Mar 28, H3131 March 27, 2007 and it undercuts what we have done in a very, very I think informed way, de-tailed way, talking about storage pat-terns, talking about rail transpor-tation routes, talking about the anal-ysis of these storage patterns and then requires a compilation of that informa-tion and analysis of that information and consideration of that information and then informed judgment, not some-thing like this which says, you know, you have to do it only one way. So, as I say, I understand what the gentleman has said. It sounds good when you first look at it; but if you really look at what it means, it is going to tie the Secretary 's hands to move in a particular direction that may or may not allow us to be safer than we are today; and for that reason, I would hope that we would vote this down. If the gentleman would like to work with us on a bipartisan basis, as I did with Mr. M ARKEY before, that would be superior to this. This unfortunately, as I say, is a do-good amendment which either does nothing or does harm to the interests of this bill as presented by our committee on a bipartisan basis. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. COHEN. Thank you. It is my un- derstanding that the Markey amend-ment dealt with a study. This does not deal with a study. Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. No, no. I take my time back. The Markey amendment does not just deal with a study. Read the Markey amendment. It starts with a study. Then it requires the Secretary to come forward with regulations. Then it re-quires certain action on the part of all the parties involved. It is not just a mere study. Working that hard on it, I frankly do not appreciate you trying to say that it is just a study. That is not true whatsoever. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. First of all, the gentleman knows that we look forward in our committee to work on this issue dealing with trucks. I would say that the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee 's amendment does not push it off to trucks. It only wants to reduce chemicals. I thank the gentleman for yielding. b1630 The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time has expired on this amendment. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ten-nessee (Mr. C OHEN ). The question was taken; and the Act- ing Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-ceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Tennessee will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . CASTLE The Acting CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 110 -74. Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. C ASTLE : At the end of title I, insert the following (and conform the table of contents accord-ingly): SEC. lll . STUDY OF FOREIGN RAIL SECURITY PRACTICES. The Secretary shall \u2014 (1) study select foreign rail security prac- tices, and the cost and feasibility of imple-menting selected best practices that are not currently used in the United States, includ-ing\u2014 (A) implementing covert testing processes to evaluate the effectiveness of rail system security personnel; (B) implementing practices used by foreign rail operators that integrate security into infrastructure design; (C) implementing random searches or screening of passengers and their baggage; and (D) establishing and maintaining an infor- mation clearinghouse on existing and emer-gency security technologies and security best practices used in the passenger rail in-dustry both in the United States and abroad; and (2) report the results of the study, together with any recommendations that the Sec-retary may have for implementing covert testing, practices for integrating security in infrastructure design, random searches or screenings, and an information clearing-house to the Committee on Homeland Secu-rity and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, and the Committee on Transpor-tation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 270, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. C ASTLE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Delaware. Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise to offer an important amend- ment to the legislation before us today. As many of my colleagues have noted, terrorists are increasingly tar-geting rail and transit systems throughout the world. The recent bombings in India, London and Madrid are clear evidence of this dangerous trend. While the concept of rail security is relatively new here at home, security officials in Europe and Asia have dec-ades of experience with terrorist at-tacks, and I have long believed in the importance of leveraging this experi-ence to improve our own system. In 2003, I asked the Government Ac- countability Office to undertake an in- depth study of foreign rail security practices. Over the course of several months, a GAO team visited 13 dif-ferent foreign rail systems, and a sub-sequent report identified many innova-tive measures to secure rail systems, many of which are currently being used in the U.S. Most significantly, however, the GAO report identified four important for-eign rail security practices that are not currently being used to any great extent in the United States. First, the report found that other na- tions have improved the vigilance of their security staff by performing daily unannounced events, known as covert testing, to gauge responsiveness to in-cidents such as suspicious packages or open emergency doors. Similarly, two of the thirteen foreign operators interviewed by GAO also re-ported success using some form of ran-dom screening to search passengers and baggage for bombs and other suspicious materials. This practice has been used sporadically in the U.S., including in New York City following in the 2005 London bombings, but has never been implemented for any continuous period of time. The GAO also noted that many for- eign governments maintain a national clearinghouse on security technologies and best practices. Such a government- sponsored database would allow rail op-erators to have one central source of information on the merits of rail secu-rity technology, like chemical sensors and surveillance equipment. Finally, while GAO noted that the Department of Transportation has taken steps to encourage rail operators to consider security when renovating or constructing facilities, many foreign operators are still far more advanced when it comes to incorporating aspects of security into infrastructure design. For example, this photograph here to my left of the London Underground demonstrates several security up-grades, such as vending machines with sloped tops to reduce the likelihood of a bomb being placed there, clear trash bins, and netting throughout the sta-tion to prevent objects from being left in recessed areas. As you can see, the London stations are also designed to provide security staff with clear lines of sight to all areas of the station, in-cluding underneath benches and ticket machines. The British government has praised these measures for deterring terrorist attacks. In one incident their security cameras recorded IRA terrorists at-tempting to place an explosive device inside a station. According to London officials, due to infrastructure design and improvements, the terrorists were deterred when they could not find a suitable location to hide the device in-side the station. While the GAO acknowledged that deploying these four practices in this VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:40 Mar 28, H3132 March 27, 2007 country may be difficult, in fact, ran- dom screening may pose many chal-lenges, it is clear that these foreign se-curity techniques deserve greater con-sideration. Therefore, the amendment I am offering today would take steps to improve rail and transit security by re-quiring the Secretary of Homeland Se-curity to study the cost and feasibility of implementing these practices and submit a report making recommenda-tions to the Homeland Security Com-mittee and Transportation Committee within one year of enactment. Mr. Chairman, recent attacks on rail and transit throughout the world un-derscores the importance of acting now to upgrade security here at home. My amendment will make certain that we are knowledgeable and consider all available options when it comes to en-suring the safety and security of our rail system. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition. I am not opposed, but I would claim the time. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without ob- jection, the gentlelady is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I thank the distinguished gentleman. I believe this is a thoughtful amend- ment. The committee believes this adds to the legislation on the floor. We should look into security practices used by other countries that have expe-rience with attacks on rail and mass transit systems. This timeframe, the month of March, sadly commemorates the tragedy in Madrid. Certainly we are well aware of the London train bombings. Their in-sight, their recovery, their instructions would be very important. This study should include an evaluation of prac-tices such as covert testing, security measures built into infrastructure and random searches of passengers and bag-gage. When GAO testified before our com- mittee, we learned that, while we share many rail security practices with other countries such as customer awareness, canine teams, limited passenger and baggage screening and technology up-grades, there were many practices that we haven 't fully vetted. It makes sense to learn what we can from our neigh-bors who have already done a lot of work in this area. I know that this is a tough challenge. This bill, I believe, answers a lot of the concerns about the massiveness of rail travel and passenger travel and all that goes into securing that particular trav-el. Looking at what our neighbors are doing and what other countries are doing, Mr. C ASTLE , I think it provides us an added road map for a complicated process which really impacts certain areas of our country more so than oth-ers. The Northeast corridor, of course, deserves our fullest measure of support when it comes to passenger travel for the numbers of systems that are here. I ask my colleagues to support it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I will just take a moment. First, let me first thank very much the distinguished Congresswoman from Texas for her very kind words about the amendment. I am a strong believer, as you have indicated as well, that when there are good ideas out there that we should borrow these ideas. I be-lieve this is something we should do. I don 't mean to burden Homeland Se- curity with studies, but to me this is a relatively simple study matter and something which I think will ulti-mately provide greater safety to people in this country. Hopefully, all can support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I simply ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the gentleman for his thoughtful contribution to this bill. I support Mr. C ASTLE 's amendment. We should look into security practices used by other countries that have experience with terrorist attacks on rail and mass transits sys-tems. This study should include an evaluation of practices such as covert testing, security measures built into infrastructure, and random searches of passengers and baggage. When GAO testified before our committee, we learned that while we share many rail se-curity practices with other countries, such as customer awareness, canine teams, limited passenger and baggage screening, and tech-nology upgrades, there were many practices that we haven 't fully vetted. It makes sense to learn what we can from our neighbors who have already done a lot of work in this area. I ask that my colleagues support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The ques- tion is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. C ASTLE ). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . SESSIONS The Acting CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 110 -74. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 5 offered by Mr. S ES- SIONS : At the end of title I, insert the following new section: SEC. 132. USE OF FUNDS BY AMTRAK. None of the funds appropriated pursuant to this Act, except pursuant to section 108, may be used by Amtrak for any of the 10 long-dis-tance routes of Amtrak that have the high-est cost per seat/mile ratios according to the September 2006 Amtrak monthly perform- ance report, unless the Secretary has trans-mitted to Congress a waiver of the require-ment under this section with respect to a route or portion of a route that the Sec-retary considers to be critical to homeland security. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 270, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S ESSIONS ) and a Mem- ber opposed each will control 5 min-utes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a straightforward at-tempt to prevent any further taxpayer money from being spent to place addi-tional unnecessary cost on Amtrak 's 10 least profitable routes. I would like to talk a little bit about what this amendment does not do. This amendment does not remove any currently appropriated funds. This amendment does affect the 10 routes that are affected by the amend-ment that currently cost the taxpayer $161 million per year and will continue to cost the taxpayers $161 million if it is enacted. This amendment does not affect the funds made available in section 108, which would be used to upgrade and improve the Northeast corridor tunnels in New York City, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. This amendment does not tie the hands of the administration, because it provides the Secretary of the Depart-ment of Homeland Security with the flexibility to waive this provision should that Secretary deem that a se-curity upgrade on one of these most unprofitable routes, or even a partial part of it, would be deemed to be crit-ical to Homeland Security. What this amendment does, and it does it very simply, is stop adding un-necessary costs to the 10 worst routes that already cost Amtrak $161 million a year. The worst route in Amtrak 's system, called the Sunset Limited, which runs from New Orleans to Los Angeles, had a net loss of $20.4 million last year, or, on a cost basis to tax-payers, 25.5 cents per seat for every mile of that journey. The tenth worst route in Amtrak 's system is the City of New Orleans, which runs from Chicago to New Orle-ans, which had a net loss of $9 million last year, or a cost to taxpayers of 10.4 cents per seat for every mile of that trip. This amendment seeks to prevent further good taxpayer dollars from being thrown after bad by limiting the costs on these already unprofitable routes. All in all, it says that if Amtrak wants to compete for the $4 billion worth of funds made available under this Act, they must ensure that they are being used for routes that cost the taxpayer less than 10.4 cents per seat over every single mile, a hurdle that is hardly unreasonable. This amendment will provide fiscal discipline and accountability to a sys-tem that has already received over $30 VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:40 Mar H3133 March 27, 2007 billion in taxpayer subsidies over its lifetime. My amendment is supported by the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste and Ameri-cans for Tax Reform, which are three of the most prominent groups com-mitted to monitoring the effective use of taxpayer dollars. On behalf of fiscal discipline, I don 't know if there is anything that 's pos- sible that they could want to support on behalf of taxpayers that would be more. I encourage all of my colleagues to support my amendment. COUNCIL FOR CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE , Washington, DC, March 27, 2007. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : Soon you will have the opportunity to vote on an amendment to H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007, that will be offered by Rep. Pete Sessions (R -Texas). This amend- ment will prevent Amtrak from using any of the appropriated funds in the bill, except those noted in Section 108, from being used for any of the top ten revenue losing long- distance routes that were noted in Amtrak 's September 2006 monthly performance report. On behalf of the more than 1.2 million mem-bers and supporters of the Council for Citi-zens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I ask that you support this amendment. Amtrak has failed to produce a profit since its inception in 1971 and still has not met the Congressional deadline of December 2, 2002 to achieve self-sufficiency. As a result, it has become a black hole for taxpayer dollars. Fewer and fewer people are using the rail service due to less costly and more efficient alternatives, yet everyone pays for Amtrak through their taxes. This amendment will ensure that tax dollars will not be used to prop up non-profitable Amtrak routes and that the money will be used in appropriate areas in order to provide greater protection and safety for our nation 's public transpor- tation. It does provide a waiver from this provision if the Secretary of Homeland Secu-rity believes a route or a portion of an Am-trak route is critical to homeland security. All votes on H.R. 1401 will be among those considered in CCAGW 's 2007 Congressional Ratings. Sincerely, T HOMAS SCHATZ , President. AMERICANS FOR TAXREFORM , Washington, DC, March 26, 2007. Hon. L OUISE M. S LAUGHTER , Chairwoman, Committee on Rules, Washington, DC. D EAR CHAIRWOMAN SLAUGHTER : On behalf of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), I urge you to make in order as part of the rule the amendment offered by Congressman Pete Sessions (R -TX) to H.R. 1401, the ''Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. '' This amendment ensures the correct and ef-fective allocation of appropriations for homeland security in H.R. 1401. H.R. 1401 was created to increase protec- tion of America 's rail and public transpor- tation. Congressman Sessions ' amendment helps close loopholes that could be exploited by Amtrak to increase revenue on the least profitable of its lines. Congressman Sessions makes clear that Amtrak may petition for use of the funds on these rail lines if it is a matter of homeland security. Year after year taxpayers send Amtrak millions of dollars in funding for projects and improvements that routinely fall short of expectations. The funds in this bill have been created to aid American transportation organizations in making their services safer and more secure, not to help an archaic rail-way. Many amendments have been proposed to H.R. 1401 in an effort to make the legislation stronger and more effective. By allowing the Sessions amendment to be attached to H.R. 1401, you send a clear message that the funds included in this bill are for making America safer, not for helping Amtrak 's bottom line. Sincerely, G ROVER NORQUIST , President. NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION, Alexandria, VA, March 26, 2007. NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION VOTEALERT NTU urges all Members to vote ''yes'' on the amendment offered by Rep. Pete Ses-sions to the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 (H.R. 1401) that would prohibit funds in the bill from being used by Amtrak for any of the 10 worst revenue-los-ing long-distance routes. Amtrak has re-ceived more than $30 billion in taxpayer sub-sidies during its lifetime, yet it continues to lose money due to poor management prac-tices and insulation from real-world com-petitive business pressures. In fact, a 2005 Reason Foundation commentary noted that one unprofitable crosscountry route operated by Amtrak lost $466 per passenger in 2004! Rep. Sessions ' amendment would put an end to this kind of fiscal foolishness by stopping Amtrak from throwing good taxpayer money after bad. Roll call votes on the Sessions Amendment will be included in our annual Rating of Con-gress. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentlelady from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this is a baffling, puzzling amendment. I ask the question of my colleagues, what is one life worth? What is one life worth that travels along the Nation 's transit corridors, the intense Northeast corridor that deals with Amtrak long distance routes, 2 million people? The Sessions amendment would pro- hibit any grant funds appropriated pur-suant to this Act to be used by Amtrak for making necessary safety or secu-rity improvements along 10 Amtrak routes, with the exceptions of some of those in some of the more intense areas of New York, Baltimore and Union Sta-tion. Many of these routes provide cen-tral transportation services to rural areas. Some of them enabled Amtrak to bring water and food to the people of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and to hurricane victims. The question is, what is one life worth that is using this system? What is our responsibility as Members of the United States Congress and the Home-land Security Committee? I believe this is both a bad amend- ment but a puzzling amendment, and I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment so that we can truly have a rail security bill that secures all of the transit system that needs that cov- erage. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, so that the gentlewoman from Texas is not confused, I will repeat what we have said. The routes that we have se-lected, the 10 most unprofitable routes, do not have enough people on them to support this additional security and additional necessary things that would come under the billions of dollars of this bill. My amendment is straightforward. It allows the management of Amtrak to be able to reallocate those resources where there are a lot of people, namely, the east coast and the west coast, rath-er than providing all these new secu-rity concerns all across the country that has little to no passengers, that is unprofitable. I am trying to allow Amtrak and the management, including the people who live in the east coast and the west coast, to be able to get the full meas-ure of the security enhancements that would be necessary. I am trying to allow the men and women, the management of Amtrak, to be able to run their own business where the allocation of resources should be made. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Texas has expired. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains? The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentlelady has 3 12minutes. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me just simply say to the gentleman, so that I will clarify any suggestion of my confusion, we have 3.5 million pas-sengers who are riding Amtrak. One of the routes the gentleman wants to eliminate is from Texas to California. I believe the gentleman is from Texas. The idea is, Mr. Chairman, to make sure we have a system that is inte-grated, safe; and there are security pro-visions to make the network safe, the network that travels to the east coast, the network that travels to California, the network that travels to the North-west. That is the idea of the rail bill, to en- sure that we now have coverage and the opportunity for security where we previously did not, to avoid London and to avoid Madrid. It is now my pleasure to be able to yield to the distinguished chairman of the Transportation Committee, Mr. O BERSTAR , for such time as he might consume. b1645 Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the Chair of the subcommittee for yielding. And I respect very much the gen- tleman from Texas (Mr. S ESSIONS ). He is a very devout fiscal conservative. But, unfortunately, this language, as I read his amendment, would make very vulnerable those persons who travel Amtrak routes that don 't yield as much revenue to Amtrak as those on VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:29 Mar 28, H3134 March 27, 2007 the east coast or the west coast. The Silver Service Palmetto carries 457,000 passengers. The Silver Meteor goes from New York, Philadelphia, Wil-mington, all the way to Ft. Lauder-dale, 273,000 passengers. The Capitol Limited, Chicago to Washington, Pitts-burgh, Cleveland, Toledo, nearly 200,000 passengers. The City of New Orleans, from Chicago to New Orleans, 175,000 passengers a year. You are saying that they should be vulnerable, but not oth-ers in more densely run lines. I think that is inappropriate. Mr. SESSIONS. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. OBERSTAR. I would like to yield, but unfortunately I have com-mitted time to the gentlewoman from Florida, Chair of the Rail Sub-committee to whom, the gentlewoman controls the time, if I may yield fur-ther to her. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I thank the distinguished chairman for his elo-quent statement. Let me yield 1 minute to the distin- guished chairman of the Subcommittee on Rails on the Transportation Com-mittee. Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. This amendment jeopardizes the safety and security of over 2 million Amtrak passengers and is a huge step back-wards in protecting the Nation 's trans- portation infrastructure from harm. Amtrak was a first responder during Hurricane Katrina, delivering food and supplies and helping to evacuate thou-sands of gulf region residents when President Bush and his administration were nowhere to be found. Now they are becoming a key part in each State 's future evacuation plan. I was in New York City shortly after September 11 when the plane leaving JFK airport crashed into the Bronx. Along with many of my other col-leagues in both the House and the Sen-ate, I took Amtrak back to Wash-ington. I realized once again just how important Amtrak is to the American people and how important it is for this Nation to have alternate modes of transportation. Vote ''no'' on this amendment. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I will close by simply saying that we have asked the question and it has been answered: What is one life worth? Amtrak is part of a system. You break the security of one part of the system, Mr. Chairman, you break the security of the entire system. This amendment is important for breaking that. It is not important for making this bill work. I ask my colleagues to oppose the Sessions amendment so that the net-work of Amtrak will have a secure and safe system for those that travel on it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The ques- tion is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S ES- SIONS ). The question was taken; and the Act- ing Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I de- mand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-ceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will be post-poned. AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . FLAKE The Acting CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 110 -74. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 6 offered by Mr. F LAKE : Strike section 203. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 270, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. F LAKE ) and a Mem- ber opposed each will control 5 min-utes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike funding in the bill for the TSA puppy breeding pro-gram, the increase that is slated to take place in section 203 of the under-lying bill. The Transportation Security Admin- istration, or TSA, has a puppy program that puts government in the role of being the breeder of bomb-sniffing dogs. This is clearly a role for the pri-vate sector. There are literally hundreds, or thou- sands perhaps, private contractors that perform this function. It seems laugh-able to me that the Federal Govern-ment needs to be in the business of breeding dogs for any purpose. Some will defend the role of bomb- sniffing dogs. I don 't question the im- portance of the work that these ani-mals do. It is important. It is needed. It is certainly necessary. What I am questioning is whether or not the Federal Government ought to be in the business of breeding dogs. This is something that the private sec-tor does a lot more effectively. I would ask any American who has been to the airport, any airport at any time recently, if they believe that the TSA is so efficient in what they do that they have somehow found new ef-ficiencies in dog breeding and that this is something that they ought to be spending their time doing. I would ven-ture to say, no, that they ought to spend their time in doing the tasks that they have been given and not ex-panding their reach further into this business. How much this will cost the average American taxpayer is unclear. In the bill it simply says ''such sums as may be necessary. '' I think that we should, if there is a figure, it ought to be there rather than a simple ''such sums as may be necessary. '' We have no idea how expensive this program may be-come. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time and look forward to hearing the justification for this program. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Who claims time in opposition? Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposi-tion. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentle- woman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, again, let me simply say that we are speaking about an existing program. We know that throughout our security system the FBI, Customs and Border Protection, we use bomb-sniff-ing dogs. And this is a program that al-ready exists. It strikes the increase in TSA's, Transportation Security Ad- ministration 's, already-existing pro- gram, domestic canine breeding pro-gram that is called for in this bill. Interestingly enough, this was added by Mr. R OGERS , M IKEROGERS of our committee, of Alabama. This was added in the markup because he is the ranking member on our Management and Personnel Subcommittee. He un-derstands the need for these canines. It was accepted in a spirit of bipartisan-ship. The TSA canine teams are a key part of the equation in keeping our trav-eling public secure, and we all support expanding this program. I ask one person in here, when they see dogs coming to be part of the secu-rity team, how many people want to reject that canine team that is very ef-fective in determining whether some-thing heinous and horrific is going to act, even on this very campus in the United States Congress. I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve my time. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I appre- ciate the discussion on this. As I said, nobody is questioning, certainly not me, the need to have bomb-sniffing dogs. The FAA has had programs since 1972. Those programs have continued. But in 1999 the FAA, and as later taken up by the TSA, got into the busi-ness of dog breeding. All this amend-ment says is, don 't go any further. I have yet to hear a justification why the Federal Government needs to be in the business of dog breeding. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. FLAKE. I yield to the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. One of the main reasons is we don 't have the ca- pacity domestically to breed these dogs. Of the dogs that we use in TSA now, about 420, only about 15 percent, are bred in the domestic program here. We have to go overseas to European sources for these dogs because you can't just use any kind of dogs. They have to have particular breeds that have skill sets and the ability to sniff a variety of not only drugs but explo-sives, and we can 't get them domesti- cally. And I find it odd that I am on the other side of this issue because I am the one that is usually criticized for VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:40 Mar 28, H3135 March 27, 2007 advocating more contracting out. But the fact is domestically we just do not have the capacity to provide these dogs that we need in TSA or in other areas, CBP, Secret Service or in DOD. DOD is obtaining the majority of its dogs from European sources as well. I think that is unacceptable as Americans. Mr. FLAKE. Reclaiming my time, I have here a list of many, many compa-nies that perform this function already that offer canine support services in the private sector. I still don 't know why the Federal Government is in the business. I haven 't heard justification, and I don 't think we can take it at face value. I will bet if you go to the private con-tractors here they would say there is enough. There are plenty of people in the private sector that are doing this. Why is the Federal Government com- peting with the private sector? Why are we in the business? I can guarantee you that TSA hasn 't found efficiencies that people in the private sector already know. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. FLAKE. I yield to the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. The inter- esting thing about TSA, I have been over to, the last couple of years, most of the breeding and training programs for canines in this country. And the in-teresting thing about TSA is they have the most stellar breeding program be-cause they are genetically breeding a dog that is particularly useful in trans-portation settings at detecting explo-sives and being on its feet for long peri-ods of time. The contractors you are talking about, you can buy dogs in this coun-try. Not the breeds that we need. That is the problem. If we could, I would be on your side of this amendment. We can't. That is why currently we are ob- taining over 80 percent of our dogs from European sources. And they are private sources, by the way. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I simply have a hard time believing that there aren't sufficient private sector contrac- tors out there. And if the Federal Gov-ernment needs to set some standards and say we will only take dogs or com-panies that are licensed this way or that way, they can do that. But to get in the business of competing is simply wrong. I would urge adoption of the amend- ment. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, let me yield 1 12minutes to the distinguished subcommittee Chair on the Transportation Committee and a member of the Homeland Security Committee, Mr. D EFAZIO of Oregon. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, the simple answer to Mr. F LAKE is, this saves the taxpayers money. And I know that is a concern to the gentleman. We have here certified breeding stock that was donated to the Government of the United States of America by the Australian Customs Service that has a great line of dogs that are easily trained and have a low failure rate once they reach maturity. The gentleman obviously doesn 't know much about dogs. And in fact, I would say there might even be a secu-rity risk. There are not a lot of breed-ers in the U.S. who are training for this specific purpose. In fact, many police agencies now have to buy their dogs from Germany. Remember the Hamburg cell? Do you want them infiltrating our dog pro-gram, maybe with secret German com-mands that we don 't know? I mean, come on. This is a national security issue, to have a little fun with the gen-tleman. But the point is, these dogs are great stock. It is less expensive. They go to a foster home for a year. That isn 't a year that you would have to pay for with a breeder, and then they get their final training. They have a very low failure rate. That again saves money for the program. We are saving money here. We are providing a vital service. The gen-tleman doesn 't strike the previous sec- tion of the bill, 201, which requires a dramatic increase in dogs for the pro-gram, which is fully warranted because they are extraordinarily effective de-terrents, and they are very good at de-tecting problems, explosives, drugs and other contraband. So I would say that the gentleman really should withdraw his amendment if he is interested in saving the tax-payers money. Privatization for pri-vate profits ' sake is not the way to serve our taxpayers and our security well in this matter. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I would be delighted to yield 30 seconds to the distinguished Chair of the Transportation Committee, Mr. O BERSTAR . Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, the godfather of security dogs, the gen-tleman from Indiana (Mr. B URTON ), would probably be surprised at this de-bate unfolding this afternoon. When I was Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee, we were doing a major security act, he came to me with this idea of using dogs as a supplement to security, and I agreed to it. We in-cluded the language, and it has pro-ceeded now to this stage of breeding special dogs that have staying power and the ability to cleanse their system of previously inhaled items in order to sustain the work of security. The gentleman 's amendment is mis- guided. b1700 Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New York (Mr. K ING). Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair- man, let me just make two points. There is nobody on our committee who is more dedicated to this issue than Mr. R OGERS . There is also no one in the Congress who I know that is more dedicated to contracting out than Mr. R OGERS , his dedication on this issue and the fact that we have to real-ize that it is more important to know the value of something rather than just the price. The fact is, this is a situa-tion where both the price and the value call for us to go forward with this pro-gram. This is an issue of Homeland Se-curity. We can trivialize it. We can have some fun with it. But the fact is it is a very, very important issue. So I ask for defeat of the amendment. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the rank-ing member of the subcommittee, Mr. R OGERS . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair- man, I do want to go back to one ques-tion the gentleman from Arizona had, and that was the cost. Roughly, we are spending about $500,000 on this TSA breeding and training program. It trains about 50 dogs a year now. It can double that capacity with this. This breeding is very important, par- ticularly at this facility because it is on the cutting edge. I would urge this Congress to recognize how significant it is that we are able to produce this kind of dog here, and I would tell you that I have also been a big advocate on the DOD side as well of our trying to create more breeding programs domes-tically. I would like to see them be pri- vate, frankly, but we don 't have that capacity right now that can put the standard of quality of dogs out that we need so that we don 't have to rely on foreign sources for these dogs. Because I can assure you we are not getting the first quality and the quantity that we need. So I would urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. It is truly a matter of national security both in TSA and I think in DOD. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, to close, let me just thank Mr. R OGERS for the underlying lan- guage and make the point again that this is a question of security and to contract out, privatize the breeding of these dogs and/or to use foreign-bred dogs may raise a question in terms of source, resource, and utilization. This is good language in this bill that allows TSA to continue its program, particularly since we are expanding rail security and therefore needing the increase in the canine breed. I would ask my colleague to defeat the Flake amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The ques- tion is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. F LAKE ). The amendment was rejected. AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MR . FLAKE The Acting CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 110 -74. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:40 H3136 March 27, 2007 Amendment No. 7 offered by Mr. F LAKE : Strike section 107 and redesignate the suc- ceeding sections accordingly and conform the table of contents. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 270, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. F LAKE ) and a Mem- ber opposed each will control 5 min-utes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike section 107 of the underlying bill. This section au-thorizes $87 million for a new Home-land Security grant program for pri-vate bus companies. I and some of my colleagues have ex- pressed concern about what we see as Homeland Security grant waste. It is everywhere in the country. It is in my district. It is in virtually every district across the country. I pointed out in a recent meeting that in my own district there is some Homeland Security funding going to things like synchronization of street lights. It shouldn 't come from the Fed- eral Government. It needs to be done, should be done, by local governments. In this case, this is activity that should be done by the private compa-nies themselves. We have seen Homeland Security grants in recent years go to protect mushroom festivals, lawn mower races, investigations into bingo halls, and puppet show performances. There seems to be no end to the waste. Yet now we are going to authorize a new Homeland Security grant program to go to private bus operators like the Hampton Jitney? For those who have not ridden on the Hampton Jitney, it is a private bus service that brings wealthy East Side Manhattanites to their beach homes in the Hamptons. The Hampton Jitney and other private bus companies such as Greyhound and Peter Pan Bus Lines have received Homeland Security grant dollars under the Intercity Bus Secu-rity Grant program in 2005. This is corporate welfare, pure and simple. These are for-profit enterprises that should not be underwritten by the taxpayer. This amendment to eliminate this wasteful spending is supported by an array of taxpayer groups across the country. I would urge its adoption. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposi-tion to the amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentle- woman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment striking the bus security grant provided in this bill. The underlying jurisdiction of this particular subcommittee and Home-land Security includes responsibility of over-the-road buses. We plan to look even more extensively at the necessary security requirements of making sure that people who travel in bus transpor-tation likewise deserve the coverage and security that we can provide. More people ride over-the-road buses and more communities and destinations are served by those buses than any other form of intercity passenger transpor-tation. Jitney-type buses are not the only forms of buses, but they are part of the bus transportation of this country. Buses and bus terminals have been the targets of suicide bombers in countries like Iraq, Israel, Pakistan, and else-where in the world. The question for the Homeland Security Department and the Homeland Security Committee is to be preventative in front of the tragedy, not behind it. This legislation is to get us in front, to look at areas that we have not looked at before. Worldwide over the last 80 years, 47 percent of surface transportation ter-rorist attacks have involved buses. We have seen the horrific tragedy. We have seen the loss of lives, the loss of lives of children. We must invest the money needed to protect bus passengers; and I believe the gentleman 's amendment may be well-intended but, frankly, underestimates the need of security measures for buses and undermines the bill. I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, let me point out that in 2005 I mentioned there is already an Intercity Bus Secu-rity Grant award program. Under this program, since 2005, Academy Express LLC has received $267,279; Greyhound Lines has received $5,471,365; Trans- Bridge Lines, $466,611. How do you decide which private sec- tor business gets the grant and which ones don 't? What about a group like, as I mentioned, the Hampton Jitney? It is hardly a model of an intercity where it is just taking people that can 't afford to ride the bus. It goes to the Hamp-tons. Yet we are subsidizing that. Here is another one. It is called the Hampton Luxury Liner. This is an-other one that would qualify, that would be eligible to receive grants under this program. They advertise complimentary snacks, complimentary beverage, a feature movie. The latest periodicals, newspapers, and magazines are handed out to those patrons who ride those bus lines, yet they will be el-igible to receive grants, taxpayer money, to subsidize their business. Why are we doing this kind of cor- porate welfare? Where are those who stand against corporate welfare? When are they going to stand up and say, enough is enough, we shouldn 't be doing this? We are wasting too much money in the Homeland Security pro-gram that should be actually spent in threat-based programs where there are real, actual threats, instead of simply spread around by formula or favor around the country. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished sub-committee Chair of the Transportation Committee, Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. First, to correct the gentleman, it is not a new program. It is an ongoing program. However, we are going to add an ele- ment. No longer will it just be competi-tive. It will be risk-based. Now, he is true. On the Republican watch, when they controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House, there were scandalous and wasteful expendi-tures of funds by the early startup of the Department of Homeland Security, which actually I opposed creating that giant new bureaucracy. I thought we could have done it in a much more ef-fective way. However, I serve on the committee now that has jurisdiction over that. We are cleaning up the mess you guys cre-ated. This is a risk-based program. It is competitive. Now, are we are telling the 800 mil- lion people a year who ride buses in the U.S. they are third or fourth class? The gentleman says it is a private under-taking; they shouldn 't even be able to get risk-based competitive grants. Well, would you abandon aviation secu-rity, too? That is also a private indus-try. Rail? Well, most of that is private, with the exception of Amtrak. All of maritime is private, so I guess we will sort of abandon the ports. If you follow that principle to its il- logical conclusion, we would not spend public taxpayer dollars to defend any mode of transportation in this country, with very narrow exceptions. That is not the criteria that we need to apply here: risk-based, competitive. Now, what happened after 9/11? How did people get around the country? We need alternate modes. An important Federal official was here on 9/11. He had to get back to Or-egon. He took Amtrak. Other people took the bus system. So you have got to understand redundancy. You have got to understand risk. And, hopefully, we will provide the oversight that was lacking before to make sure that we don't have any more of those scan- dalous things that he talked about. Those are the past. That was on the all-Republican watch. We will do bet-ter. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I applaud the talk about cleaning up the extrava-gant spending in the past. I applaud it. I just don 't see it. I just wish that you would say, all right, this was a scandal. We gave out millions and millions of dollars to private bus companies and others. Yet how are we going to fix it? We are going to create a new author-ized program, a new one on top of this. VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:40 Mar 28, H3137 March 27, 2007 Instead of saying, let 's go in and find the waste, fraud, and abuse that was there before, we are not doing that. We are adding a new program. What this amendment does is simply strikes funding for the new authoriza-tion so we don 't do more. If we do need these expenditures that are risk-based, then let 's take out the formula funding that we are already doing. If you are in the majority and you have the power to do it, please don 't blame those in the past. I have no brief for what we did before. I didn 't vote for the creation of the Department. But if there is waste and abuse, let 's take care of it. Let 's not add to it. And that is what we are seeking to do with this amendment. Don 't go any further. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I will be happy to yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. D EFAZIO). Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, in re- sponse to the gentleman from Arizona, we have added the risk element which wasn 't there previously. And he is right. We are still confronted with the Bush administration. But I feel that the new TSA administrator is the best we have ever had, and let 's give him the tools he needs to do his job prop-erly. Risk-based, competitive grants. If he doesn 't find there is risk in the intercity bus service, then he shouldn 't give out the grants. I think he will find plenty of meritorious, risk-based, com-petitive grants that will help better protect the traveling public in this vital mode of transportation. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, let me close by saying we are already spend-ing millions and millions, tens of mil-lions of dollars on programs to make sure that bus travel and other modes of transportation travel are safe. Let 's not add another program so that the Hampton Jitney and other private sec-tor businesses can continue to receive this kind of corporate welfare. We can 't keep doing this. We have a massive def-icit and a huge debt. When are we going to say, let 's stop authorizing new programs like this? Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I will just finish. I will say again, let 's not authorize a new program when we con-cede that there is considerable waste in the current program. To say that we simply can 't address what is in the past, these programs are continuing forward. Let 's simply say, let's take from this formula, the money that is distributed by formula and favor, and apply it toward the real risks out there, rather than creating new authorization for new spending on programs that can be taken care of elsewhere. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me close, Mr. Chairman. Mr. F LAKE has one philosophy about security, and that is narrow and let us not move forward. The underlying bill makes a whole new statement to Amer-ica, that we are planning on reviewing those areas that are failing in security and improve them. Has anyone heard of the eighth grade school bus trip, where children fill up a long-distance bus going somewhere that you hope your children will return from? b1715 That is what we are trying to im- prove, the tragedy that may occur when people are using over-the-road buses. This is what this program is. It is not a program of waste; it is based on risk. As well, we are holding TSA accountable in the utilization of funds. This is a bad amendment that under- mines the new idea, which is to make sure that all aspects of America 's secu- rity are both reviewed and provided re-sources so we can do the right thing and move forward with the right pro-gram that is fiscally responsible, but also provides the security necessary. This amendment undermines the un- derlying bill and certainly takes away the necessary security for over-the- road buses. I ask my colleagues to op-pose this amendment. I strongly oppose this amendment striking the bus security grants provided in this bill. More people ride over-the-road buses, and more communities and destinations are served by those buses, than any other form of inter-city passenger transportation. Buses and bus terminals have been the tar- gets of suicide bombers in Iraq, Israel, Paki-stan and elsewhere in the world. Worldwide, over the last 80 years, 47% of surface transportation terrorist attacks have in-volved buses. We must invest the money needed to pro- tect bus passengers. I encourage my colleagues to vote against this amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time has expired on this amendment. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. F LAKE ). The question was taken; and the Act- ing Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting Chairman. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-ceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MR . LYNCH The Acting CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 110 -74. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 8 offered by Mr. L YNCH : At the end of section 109, add the fol- lowing: (g) R EPORTING REQUIREMENTS .\u2014Not later than one year after the issuance of guide-lines under subsection (a)(2), the Secretary shall conduct a survey regarding the satis-faction of workers regarding the effective-ness and adequacy of the training programs. In addition, the Secretary shall submit a re-port to the appropriate congressional com-mittees regarding the results of the survey and the progress of providers of covered transportation in meeting the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (d). The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 270, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. L YNCH ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking Chairman B ENNIE THOMPSON , Chairman O BERSTAR , Rank- ing Member M ICA, and Ranking Mem- ber P ETER KINGfor their great work on this bill. This amendment actually strength- ens the worker training requirements contained in H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act, by ensuring that Congress is kept in-formed of the progress that must be made in rail and mass transportation providers providing basic security training to their front line workers. Specifically, this amendment would require the Secretary of Homeland Se-curity within 1 year of issuing the worker training guidance mandated by section 109 of this bill to submit a com-prehensive progress report to Congress on the steps that rail and mass transit entities have taken to meet the bill 's worker-training requirements. Notably, this report must also in- clude the result of a worker survey conducted by the Department on whether our front line rail workers and mass transit employees have actually received basic security training. Mr. Chairman, this amendment stems from the reluctance on the part of the Department of Homeland Secu-rity and the rail industry carriers to make worker training a priority. Back in November, Chairman T HOMP - SONand I addressed the National Rail Symposium here in Washington, a rail security conference attended by rail workers, union representatives, indus-try experts, and transportation schol-ars. The symposium marked the re-lease of a key rail security study pre-pared by the National Rail College which noted that our Nation 's rail workers continue to lack basic and necessary emergency and anti-ter-rorism training. The National Labor College study came on the heels of a 2005 Rail Worker Safety Report prepared by the Inter-national Brotherhood of Teamsters Rail Security Conference based on over 4,000 surveys completed by the mem-bers of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way employees. Regrettably, that report re-vealed that 84 percent, of rail workers VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:40 Mar 28, 27, 2007 surveyed had not received any ter- rorism prevention training within the last year, and that 64 percent had not ever been trained in their railroad emergency response plan. Mr. Chairman, reports that our loco- motive engineers, our train crews, con-ductors, track workers, bridge and building trade employees, our elec-tricians and all other front line rail employees have not received basic se-curity training, are particularly trou-bling, given that the pattern of ter-rorist activity around the globe con-tinues to be markedly centered on rail and mass transit. You can follow the pattern of at- tacks, Mr. Chairman. Whether it be in 1995 with the sarin gas attacks in Tokyo, the 1995 attacks by the Alge-rian rebels in Paris, the 2004 suicide bombings of the Moscow metro rail car by Chechen separatists, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the 2005 London train bombings, or recently the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, terrorists have indi-cated that this is a preferred area of terrorism, and there is no indication that there is any let-up here. Their willingness to execute bold attacks on rail and transit systems worldwide con-tinues. Yet despite these lessons learned, our rail and mass transit workers still lack basic and necessary security training, and since 9/11 we have spent over $24 billion on aviation security versus less than $600 million on rail and transit. The Rail Security Summit that we had in Boston not long ago revealed the fact that very few of these workers have been trained at all. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, as well as the main bill, bipartisan legislation that is the result of good work on the part of Chairman T HOMPSON , again Ranking Member K INGof the Homeland Secu- rity Committee, as well as Chairman O BERSTAR and also Mr. M ICA, the rank- ing member of the Transportation Committee. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Who claims the time in opposition? Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without ob- jection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. Mr. Chairman, this is a worthy amendment. We need information of this nature. In hearings that I con-ducted last year as the Chair of the rel-evant subcommittee and in hearings we have had this year, we have had con-flicting bits of information from those in management and those representing labor as to the length and breadth of the training programs that are avail-able and that have been actually im-plemented. We never got a definitive answer in that regard, even though we requested it from both sides. Therefore, this amendment I think will be of benefit not only to the De-partment, but to those of us in this body such that we might be able to make a determination as to the extent and effectiveness, as well as adequacy, of the security training programs that we have been told are already in effect, but now that are specifically required under section 109 of this bill. Under this amendment, the Sec- retary would submit to us a report on the results of the survey and the progress of the providers of the covered transportation, and that is something that we have been lacking in the past. So I thank the gentleman for this amendment. This bill requires mandatory security training programs for all rail, mass transit and over-the-road bus employ-ees and requires that the employers provide such training within 1 year of the issuance of regulations. In order for us to exercise our proper oversight, this information is necessary. In order for us to put forth appropriate prod-ding with respect to both the employ-ers and the employees in this regard, I think this survey will be very, very beneficial. Having said that with reference to the specifics of this, let me just remark on some things that have been said on this floor about where we have been previous to this bill. The fact of the matter is that those of us on this committee, on a bipar-tisan basis, for at least the last 3 years I have been here, and I have been as-sured before that with the select com-mittee, we have worked to try and re-spond in an appropriate way to the threats coming from 9/11 and the things that we have learned subsequent to 9/ 11. It is true that in the immediate re-sponse to 9/11 the administration and the Congress worked together and in some ways pushed money out the door without a risk-based analysis. That has changed over the last num- ber of years. There has been a commit-ment on a bipartisan basis in this com-mittee and on this floor and in the Sen-ate and in the conference in all the bills that we have passed that a risk- based assessment is necessary for a strategy for our tactics and our grants. Now, I will say I think we are more en-lightened on this side of the Capitol than maybe some of our friends over in the other body in terms of how we make sure that we are dedicated to a risk-based analysis, but we have been going forward with that. Also I would like to say with respect to the administration, Secretary Chertoff, his number two, his number three and the head of TSA, have all committed themselves publicly and privately and I think in their actions to a risk-based analysis. We are all in this together. I don 't think there is any disagreement on the risk-based analysis being absolutely es-sential to tactics, to strategy, and to grants. It is in this bill, as it should be; it was in the bills that we passed over the last 2 years, as it should have been; and it is in the actions of the current administration. So I just wanted to make that clear. I believe the gentleman 's amendment will be helpful in gauging the progress made in terms of training in this very serious area and giving us the kind of information necessary so that we can make informed judgments in the years ahead. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, just on the point of the risk analysis and the risk-based strategy here, I do want to note that in our rail conference, our summit on rail security, at one point I did ask the union representative of Amtrak and some of the train crews that were present where they worked. They explained they are the train crews that travel on the trains that go beneath New York City. They run the Northeast corridor from basically Bos-ton to Washington, D.C. I asked them if they had been trained on evacuation procedures in the tun-nels beneath New York City and they explained to me that, no, they had not been trained on evacuating train pas-sengers from the maze of tunnels be-neath New York City. I think reason and experience would agree that that is something that would be included in our risk-based strategy. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chair- man, we support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts. Training is a critical component of my bill. We specifically added training language to the bill because I knew that our Nation 's rail, public transportation and over-the-road bus employees were not receiving the necessary security training. Representative L YNCH 's amendment goes one step further \u2014it mandates a survey of the satisfaction of workers regarding the effective-ness and adequacy of the training. I urge my colleagues to support this amend- ment. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentle- man's time has expired. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massa-chusetts (Mr. L YNCH ). The amendment was agreed to. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIRMAN The Acting CHAIRMAN.

Nothing in section 20106 of title 49, United States Code, confers Federal jurisdiction of a question for such a cause of action. (b) S ECRETARIAL POWER .\u2014Section 20106 of title 49, United States Code, preempts only positive laws, regulations, or orders by exec-utive or legislative branch officials that ex-pressly address railroad safety or security. The Secretary and the Secretary of Trans-portation have the power to preempt such positive enactments by substantially subsuming the same subject matter, pursu-ant to proper administrative procedures.

Madam Speaker, I offer a motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. KING of New York. I am, Madam Speaker, in its present form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recom-mit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. King of New York moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1401 to the Committee on Home-land Security with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: At the end of title I, add the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): SEC. lll . IMMUNITY FOR REPORTING SUS- PICIOUS ACTIVITIES AND MITI-GATING TERRORIST THREATS RE-LATING TO TRANSPORTATION SECU-RITY.

(f) R ETROACTIVE APPLICATION .\u2014This sec- tion shall apply to activities and claims oc-curring on or after November 20, 2006. Mr. KING of New York (during the reading). Madam Speaker, I ask unani-mous consent that the motion be con-sidered as read and printed in the R ECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from New York? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion to recommit. Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, all our lives changed on Sep-tember 11. The government tried to react the best that it could; all levels of government have tried to come for-ward. But one of the most important things we have done is ask our local citizens, to ask the average person to do what they can to avoid a terrorist attack. We have asked them, for in-stance, there are signs at trains and subways and means of transportation all over the country which say, if you see something, say something. Yet we saw the incident this past No- vember in Minnesota where passengers on a US Airways flight reported what they saw as suspicious activity. That resulted in six imams being removed from the plane. Now, that is a matter that is going to be in litigation be-tween US Airways and those six imams. But what is absolutely disgraceful is to find out that lawyers are coming forward and advocacy groups are com-ing forward to represent those imams and suing, attempting to find the iden-tity of those passengers, those citizens who acted in good faith, who responded to their government and reported what they deemed to be suspicious activity. Madam Speaker, that is absolutely disgraceful. What this motion to re-commit would do would be to provide immunity for any citizen, any indi-vidual that comes forward and reports suspicious activity in good faith. If they do, they will be indemnified. This is the very least we can do, to stand by good people who come forward and re-port suspicious activity. I mean, just think if we had citizens who had seen what was happening on September 11, who saw people sitting not in their assigned seats, who had seen them being disruptive, who had seen them asking for extended seat-belts when they didn 't need them and yet, somehow, those people didn 't come forward because they were afraid of being sued. VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:44 Mar 28, H3147 March 27, 2007 If we are going to be serious, as a Na- tion, about fighting Islamic terrorism, then we have to stand by our people who come forward and report sus-picious activity. So I think it is abso-lutely essential that this motion to re-commit be passed. I can 't imagine any- one being opposed to it. Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. P EARCE ) who has been a true leader on this issue. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York for working with me on this mo-tion to recommit that we are offering today. I believe that we are going to make this legislation much better. Ever since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have been telling the Amer-ican people that they should imme-diately report any suspicious activity. This important step is one of the best ways that we have to stop terrorism. In essence, the public is the eyes and ears for the security of the Nation. Sadly, a lawsuit has been filed in Minnesota which named as defendants the Americans who were simply trying to protect themselves and their coun-try. These everyday people have now found themselves subject to a lawsuit for simply reporting what they thought in good faith was suspicious activity. We are in grave danger when terror- ists and their sympathizers use our freedoms against us. Terrorists have abused our Nation 's immigration sys- tem, our foreign student travel visa op-portunities, and open society 's freedom to travel. On 9/11 the hijackers knew how the crew on the plane would respond and used that knowledge against the air crews to carry out their deadly at-tacks. Now, we have imams who behaved in methods similar to those 9/11 terrorists and are now using our courts to ter-rorize the Americans who reported the behavior. They used a seating pattern that was similar to the 9/11 attackers. They asked for seatbelt extensions, and then didn 't use them but laid them at their feet in an ominous gesture of dis-respect. They did not sit in assigned seats. The loud criticism of President Bush and the war all added together to create a mood of uncertainty among passengers who were watching them. If we allow these lawsuits to go for- ward, it will have a chilling effect on the future of American security. To-day's USA Today opinion stated the ''Clerics ' lawsuit threatens the secu- rity of all passengers; efforts to name those who reported suspicious actions has chilling effect. '' I will submit the full article for the R ECORD . If we are serious about fighting ter- rorism, if we are serious about pro-tecting Americans and asking them to help protect each other, then we must pass this motion. If I leave my colleagues with one message about this motion, it is sim-ply, no American should be sued for trying to stop terrorism. Recently, I visited Israel. There they were much more open about it. They said, the stakes are too high. The dan-ger is too imminent. There is no room left in the world for political correct-ness. Today we are going to make that choice on the floor of the House, to choose political correctness or to choose to protect the people in this country and the people who would bring the attention of suspicious ac-tivities to the Nation 's authorities. Vote ''yes'' on today 's motion to re- commit and help protect Americans. [From USA Today, Mar. 27, 2007] OURVIEW ON POST-9/11 T RAVEL : CLERICS ' LAWSUIT THREATENS SECURITY OF ALLPAS- SENGERS ''If you see something, say something. '' Since the terror attacks of 9/11, that com- mon-sense message has been displayed prominently worldwide for obvious reasons. Police and transportation authorities can 't be everywhere. Whether at an airport, bus or rail station, officials need passengers to alert them to unattended baggage that might contain explosives and behavior that appears out of the ordinary. Now the reward for being vigilant appar- ently includes being dragged into a lawsuit and accused of bigotry. The wry adage about how no good deed goes unpunished seems apt, though not so funny. The lawsuit grew out of an incident last November when six Muslim clerics, return-ing from a religious conference in Min-neapolis, were removed from a US Airways flight after passengers and crew raised alarms. The imams were questioned by au-thorities and released. The six say they are innocent victims of ethnic profiling for merely praying quietly in Arabic at the ter-minal. Their lawsuit, filed earlier this month, ac- cused the airline and Metropolitan Airports Commission of anti-Muslim bias. That was expected. What 's unique and especially trou- bling, though, is the effort to identify an un-known number of passengers and airline em-ployees who reported suspicions so they might also be included as defendants. For ex-ample, the imams want to know the names of an elderly couple who turned around ''to watch '' and then made cellphone calls, pre- sumably to authorities, as the men prayed. This legal tactic seems designed to intimi- date passengers willing to do exactly what authorities have requested \u2014say something about suspicious activity. The imams ' actions last November ap- peared to be either deliberately provocative or clueless as to how others might perceive them. Several passengers and crewmembers told authorities that the men loudly chanted ''Allah '' several times, cursed U.S. involve- ment in Iraq and switched their seat assign-ments. Three imams asked for seat belt ex-tenders, which include a heavy metal buckle that could be used as a weapon, but left them on the floor. Under the circumstances, the pilot made a reasonable judgment call to remove them from the plane. Some of the facts are in dis-pute: The imams deny making any anti- American remarks and say seats were changed to accommodate a blind cleric who might need assistance. They accuse the air-line of slandering them. US Airways can afford to defend itself and the crew in court. Passengers who notified authorities don 't have those resources. Sev- eral lawyers have promised to represent such passengers for free. The American Islamic Forum for Democracy, a moderate Muslim group, will raise funds for their defense. Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., has introduced a bill to shield from legal liability those who re-port suspicious behavior. It shouldn 't have to come to that, espe- cially if a judge has the wisdom to throw out the complaints against the ''John Doe '' pas- sengers before they 're identified. As for ethnic profiling \u2014the reprehensible practice of discriminating solely based on ethnicity \u2014this incident doesn 't qualify. The imams were tossed off the plane because of suspicious behavior, which obviously can 't be ignored. Suing passengers who merely re-port such behavior threatens everyone 's abil- ity to travel securely. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I rise to claim time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed? Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. In its present form I am. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, as you know, we just received the motion to recommit a few minutes ago, and if I could ask some questions of the ranking member about the motion to recommit, it would help. You have the motion to recommit being retroactive back until November 20, 2006. Is there any reason for that date? Mr. KING of New York. Will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I yield to the gentleman from New York. Mr. KING of New York. November 20 was the date of the incident in Min-nesota where the passengers on the plane reported suspicious activity to the pilots and to the flight attendants. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Have they been charged with anything, to your knowledge? Mr. KING of New York. If the gen- tleman will yield, a lawsuit is being commenced and John Does are being named in the complaints, the John Does for the purpose of finding out the identity of those passengers, those good-faith passengers who came for-ward to report the suspicious activity to make them defendants in the case. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. But to your knowledge no criminal charges have been filed against the people on the plane. Mr. KING of New York. This motion is only dealing with civil cases, which is why they would also be indemnified for their reasonable costs and attor-neys' fees. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Re- claiming my time, Madam Speaker, I think the issue is if individuals who were singled out, not charged with any-thing in violation of the law, then why shouldn 't they be able to seek remedy in a court of law? For the sake of discussion, Madam Speaker, all of us in this body don 't look alike, and it is clear that people could be profiled because of their reli-gion or their race. b1900 I think the record is clear in this country that some people are profiled, VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:44 Mar 28, H3148 March 27, 2007 and I am wondering if people are profiled illegally, not charged with a criminal act. They absolutely should have the ability to seek redress in a court of law. What I want to do is to say that there is nothing wrong with reporting in good faith, but when it is clear that we have not defined in a good-faith lan-guage in this motion to recommit what that is, then a number of people in this country could be singled out for var-ious and sundry reasons. And what I am saying in this motion to recommit is it sets us up to start profiling against individuals regardless of reli-gion, custom, or what have you. If I am praying on a plane simply be- cause I am afraid to fly, then I could be singled out in the eyes of someone else. So I am clear that this is speculative on people who look different; it is spec-ulative on people who perhaps act dif-ferently. I am convinced that, knowing you, you have not proven on the com-mittee to be a punitive person; and the reason I say that, Mr. Ranking Mem-ber, is we should not be singling people out for personal reasons. We need to catch bad people, but we need to make sure that we are not profiling those in-dividuals because of how they look. I mean, this is America. This is the melting pot with a rainbow. The point that I am making, while this motion to recommit might be well-intended, it has unintended con-sequences on a lot of people, people who, for religious or other reasons, might look different; and I think that the offerers of this motion to recommit should think about this. Because we are not a body or a country of just one people. And if you look at it, we should be tolerant, and tolerant doesn 't mean singling people out or having them ar-rested for no apparent reason other than the fact that they look different. Madam Speaker, I accept the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.

Pursu- ant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. R ANGEL ) and the gen- tleman from Michigan (Mr. C AMP) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, once again I find myself thanking Mr. M CCRERY , the ranking member, and members of the minority on the Ways and Means Committee for moving for-ward to a piece of legislation, agreeing that it go to the suspension calendar and, more importantly, working with us in bringing about changes in order to make certain that we have a pay-for that is appreciated by the House. This is important legislation. The Nation suffered a tremendous natural setback with Katrina. Thousands of people in Mississippi and Louisiana felt the pain. And somehow we are slug-gishly moving towards some type of so-lution of this real problem. One of the major problems, of course, is housing, people not being able to come back. We on the Ways and Means Committee can play some small part in putting together tax incentives to move forward, to make certain that these people have a place to stay and go back to their home. More important, I am so pleased that J OHNLEWIS will be managing this bill, a man of compassion, a man of under-standing, a man that understands the real pain that people have felt and con-tinue to feel. I don 't think there is any Member in the House that I would rather see associated with a bill that brings some type of relief to people who have felt so much pain. So, Mr. Speaker, with your permis- sion, I would like to ask Mr. L EWIS from the sovereign State of Georgia, an outstanding Member of Congress, to VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:44 Mar 28, H3151 March 27, 2007 manage the remainder of this time and to distribute it as he sees fit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 1562, the Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act of 2007, which was introduced by my friends, the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means. It is unfortunate that we continue to deal with the aftermath of the dev-astating hurricanes of 2005. The im-print left by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast has been well documented. Unfortunately, the slow pace of recovery has also been well doc-umented, despite substantial efforts by the Ways and Means Committee and the Congress as a whole to provide di-rect and indirect support to the re-building efforts. As part of that effort, the Congress enacted the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005. Among its provisions, the measure authorized a tenfold increase in Section 42 low-income housing tax credits for States in the Gulf Oppor-tunity Zone. At the time, our hope was that putting a fast expiration on those credits would lead to the rapid rebuild-ing of this much-needed housing. Our experience, however, has shown other-wise. Delays in getting necessary per-mitting and insurance, combined with the high cost of materials and a short-age of skilled labor, have created a sit-uation in which many of the allocated credits are likely to go unused by the current December 31, 2008, deadline. The good news for the GO Zone is that credits not used by the end of 2008 will not be lost. Instead, they will re-vert back to the State for future allo-cation. But the difficulties on the ground create uncertainty as to wheth-er these projects will be placed in serv-ice by the end of 2008. Witnesses at an Oversight Sub- committee hearing earlier this month warned that many deserving projects that had been allocated credits in Lou-isiana and Mississippi by the State housing agencies are going unfunded and therefore will not be built by the end of next year. The measure before us makes several changes to the rules governing low-in-come housing tax credits in the GO Zone. These changes expire at the end of 2010. Hopefully, the modifications we are making today will allow the States to get these housing projects financed and constructed long before that sun-set date. It is my understanding from the Joint Committee that the cost of this bill is not the result of additional cred-its being used. Rather, it is that credits will be used more quickly than ex-pected under current law. Under these circumstances, I believe the changes in the bill before us are an appropriate response to the unique and unprecedented challenges in the gulf coast region and will help ensure that goals of the 2005 legislation are met. Unique circumstances sometimes re-quire unique solutions. Finally, I would like to comment on a provision of the bill being used to off-set these costs. As originally consid-ered by the committee, the measure would slightly alter the circumstances under which the government can levy the assets of an employer for unpaid employment taxes. During committee considerations, questions were raised about the provision, and I am pleased that the bill we are considering today contains an important modification to the provision that ensures that em-ployers who unknowingly fall behind in their payment of employment taxes are properly protected. On that count, particular thanks are due to the chairman, the staff of the IRS and the Treasury and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation for their help in working through this dif-ficult but important issue. Mr. Chairman, let me again express my appreciation to you and your staff for working across the aisle to craft this measure that I hope will make it possible for thousands of residents of the gulf States to go home soon. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, on March 13, 2007, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight held a hearing on housing tax issues related to the rebuilding of communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. These hurri-canes created and caused more damage than any other natural disaster and left over 700,000 residents in the Gulf Coast without housing. The Congress has provided $15 billion in tax relief to victims of the hurri-canes, but it is clear that we must do more and we can do more. The Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act of 2007 will help families affected by the hurricane to return home. This bill will extend in-centives for low-income rental housing. It will also expand existing incentives so they can be used to refinance homes that need to be rebuilt from scratch. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. This is a necessary bill. I wholeheartedly support H.R. 1562 and urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CAMP of Michigan. At this time, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from New York, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. (Mr. REYNOLDS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. REYNOLDS. I thank the gen- tleman from Michigan for yielding me this time, and I rise in support of the amended version of H.R. 1562 that is be-fore us. I greatly appreciate the re-marks of the ranking member of this side, Dave Camp, as he outlined the legislation and our support for it and the need for it, and the amendments that were brought forth by Chairman R ANGEL and by Ranking Member MCCRERY . Mr. Speaker, it has been that type of cooperation in working on legislation such as this that we were able to take a bill that is vitally needed in the Katrina zone for low-income housing tax credits to work and do their job, but to also make it work for the tax-payers as we consider the PAYGO re-quirements set forth by the rules of the House. I believe that we have worked diligently, through the efforts of staff on both the majority and the minority and Joint Tax as well as IRS, as has been outlined by previous speakers, to bring forth legislation that will work to get the job done for Katrina victims, for the States and, importantly, to see a recovery come about under the intent of this legislation. So I am going to support it. I greatly appreciate the cooperation of Chairman R ANGEL and Ranking Member M CCRERY in working forward to have legislation language that meets some of the outlines of concerns that Mr. J OHNSON and I had and have been fully met by their hard work. b1945 GENERAL LEAVE Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1562. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey, Congressman P ASCRELL . (Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, Hurri- cane Katrina was more than a natural catastrophe. The painful images of folks suffering, dying, and calling des-perately for help will forever be seared in our collective conscience. I rise today in strong support of the Katrina Housing Relief Act, critical legislation designed to respond to the needs of hurricane victims by getting affordable housing in the gulf coast region expedi-tiously built. I want to commend Chairman R AN- GEL for the steady hand he has dis- played in crafting this legislation and also for the collegial spirit he has fos-tered on the Ways and Means Com-mittee thus far. This is the second noteworthy tax package that has come to the floor in recent weeks, and I am heartened at the bipartisanship that has been displayed. And when it comes to helping those who suffered from Katrina, bipartisanship is the only way to operate. VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:44 Mar 28, March 27, 2007 Unfortunately, the immediate re- sponse from Washington was handled poorly, insufficiently, and only exacer-bated the suffering. Today, we take a step in the right direction. We need to get help to people and get them back in their homes, and this bill does that. H.R. 1562 strengthens existing tax in- centives to builders of affordable rental housing by extending the current dead-line within which those units must be inhabited by an extra 2 years, to 2010. The bill makes it easier for a greater number of homeowners to benefit from tax-exempt bonds issued by local gov-ernments for substantial renovations and to refinance existing residential mortgage loans. These are prudent, practical meas- ures that will do a great deal of good for those in need. I implore my col-leagues to support this bill. I again commend the leadership for bringing this to the floor. Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. B OUSTANY ). Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. I want to thank my colleague. I also want to thank Chairman R ANGEL and Ranking Mem- ber M CCRERY for bringing this bill to the floor. And while I am pleased that this bill is being brought to the floor this evening, its title is actually a mis-nomer. The Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act also covers many areas hit by my district in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas, those areas hit by Hurricane Rita. My district in southwest Louisiana received about $10 billion in damage from Hurricane Rita, and this was to small rural communities that don 't have the ability to bounce back. As we recover in southwest Louisiana, we have learned all too well that govern-ment cannot micromanage the full re-covery process, and this GO-Zone legis-lation has played a very important role in providing a foundation for busi-nesses and families to get back on their feet. So I am pleased that today 's legis- lation extends many of these successful provisions and programs for southwest Louisiana communities. Two of the most important include an extension of the placed-in-service deadline and a waiver of the 10 percent rule for GO-Zone credits. These provi-sions will help those who are on the front lines of our housing recovery, rather than revert funding back to the State. Additionally, the bill allows GO-Zone low-income housing projects to receive additional federally subsidized loans without facing a reduction in tax cred-its. Mr. Speaker, while I take issue with the bill 's title, I fully support its provi- sions. It is a good bill. Again, I thank Chairman R ANGEL and Ranking Mem- ber M CCRERY for their support and urge support of this bill. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 334minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana, who represents New Orleans in the Congress, Mr. J EFFER - SON. Mr. JEFFERSON. I thank the gen- tleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1562, the Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act of 2007. I am extremely grateful to Chairman R ANGEL , Ranking Member M CCRERY , Mr. L EWIS, Mr. C AMP, and the members of the Ways and Means Committee for their bipartisan support of this bill and for bringing it to the floor in this expe-ditious manner. As Chairman R ANGEL stated, it represents this Congress ''doing our part, '' he said, ''to make things right and that begins with help-ing people get back to their homes. '' Few needs are greater in the city of New Orleans and surrounding areas than affordable housing. One New Orleanian who currently resides in a FEMA trailer 1 hour north of the city surmises that many people want to move back to the city, but after look-ing at the rental prices has said, who could afford that? In the gulf coast, Katrina destroyed over one-quarter million homes. More than 30 percent of these losses involved affordable hous-ing losses, most of which were rental properties. Post-Katrina, the average rental pay- ment in New Orleans has risen 70 per-cent. Before Katrina, Mary Wright of our city paid about $300 in rent. Now she pays triple that amount. There are folks who were paying about $500 in rent are now paying $850. New Orleans ' population has diminished to only 237,000 residents from 437,000 before the storm. It is not because residents do not wish to return. It is because many cannot afford to return. The lack of af-fordable housing has caused not only a problem for citizens wishing to return, but it is also a problem for developers, planners, and investors who are strapped in their options to increase af-fordable housing. The lack of quality affordable housing that is sustainable discourages the return of a workforce and the restoration of the economy of the city. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is of great assistance to helping our people of the gulf region return home. The credits will be competitively awarded to qualified developers who are then put under the constant scru-tiny by our State housing authority to ensure that the buildings that are built are quality affordable housing. The safeguard in the system also provides for 30 years of high-quality housing, and for 15 years the rental properties developed using these tax credits must be maintained as affordable units. Should the properties not continue to meet the criteria specified when receiv-ing the reward, the IRS will recapture the tax credits. In December of 2005, Congress passed the Gulf Opportunities Zone Act, and among other much needed tax incen-tives it included a significant increase in housing credits for the Gulf States, and a 130 percent basis boost in which they treated all regions as difficult to develop areas, thus allowing them more funding for rebuilding. The gulf coast faces many obstacles to redevelopment. Extending the placed-in-service deadline for both the credits and for the treatment of dif-ficult to develop areas will remove one of them by giving planners and devel-opers in these communities a reason-able time to effectively reinvest in that community. Finally, mortgage revenue bonds have provided over 3.5 million lower-in-come Americans affordable home-ownership opportunities and another 1 million with rental housing opportuni-ties. Since Katrina, they have backed many homeowners but their utility has been limited in that these bonds are typically for first-time home buyers only. Provisions in this legislation waive this requirement for those whose homes were damaged by the hurri-canes. This will assist with the rebuild-ing efforts, allowing mortgage revenue bond proceeds to go towards refi-nancing home loans, to free up funds for the reconstruction of homes and re-newal of families. We need to do everything we can to facilitate recovery, and this bill re-moves critical obstacles to rebuilding the homes, rental properties, indeed the very life blood of the families of the gulf region. I urge passage and full support of this legislation. Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 14minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. M ELANCON ). Mr. MELANCON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I would like to thank the leadership for the bipartisan effort also. It has been a long 18, going on 19, months for the folks of Lou-isiana; and this is the kind of thing that they have needed for a long time. I am here today to speak in support of the Katrina Housing Tax and, as Mr. B OUSTANY pointed out, the Rita Hous- ing Tax, also, which will extend impor-tant tax credits and waivers that are boosting rebuilding efforts along the gulf coast. It is hard to exaggerate the devasta- tion Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused in south Louisiana. Over 1 mil-lion people had to flee their homes, and over 200,000 homes were damaged or completely destroyed. In St. Bernard Parish, a community to the east of New Orleans that I represent, it is re-ported that only five or six homes out of the 27,000 were inhabitable after the storm. It will take many years to re-pair the damage Katrina and Rita and the levee failures caused in just a few days. The enormous extent of the damage and the unprecedented time and money it will take to recover are why we need to pass the Katrina-Rita Housing Re-lief Act. For south Louisiana to re-build, we need to continue encouraging developers to build affordable housing, VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:44 Mar 28, March 27, 2007 not just high-priced condos. There is a severe housing shortage in the region, and rental prices have increased by 39 percent and more since the storm. Home sale prices in suburban parishes have also skyrocketed. Average work-ing people can 't move home because they can 't find affordable housing. One of the most important features of this bill is the extension of the Gulf Opportunity Zone low-income housing tax credit until the end of 2010. Lou-isiana is offering these tax credits to developers who build affordable hous-ing in the hurricane-affected commu-nities, but current law requires that developers have the project built and occupied by the end of 2008. In the post-storm world of south Lou- isiana, this is almost impossible. The Housing Financing Agency in New Or-leans estimates that 65 percent of the affordable housing units under develop-ment, about 11,050 units, won 't make the deadline to be available for rent by the deadline at the end of 2008. Add all the extenuating circumstances of post- Katrina Louisiana, mold remediation for flood-damaged rehabilitation projects, elevation of property, getting permits, going through the zoning re-quirements, all the things that take time, including needing water, sewer, and gas lines, there is no way that de-velopers can finish. Finally, as a fiscal conservative and a Blue Dog, I want to point out that this bill follows House PAYGO rules and will not increase the deficit. In fact, the offsets that are contained in the bill will cause an increase in rev-enue. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, and I thank the bipartisan effort of the committee. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I fully support H.R. 1562, the Katrina Housing Relief Act of 2007. Adequate and affordable housing is a basic human right, and today Congress is stepping in again to give our citizens of the gulf coast some help. This bill will provide tax incentives to ensure that adequate and affordable housing is available in the gulf coast region. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ''yes'' for this bill. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. I rise today in support of the amended version of H.R. 1562. During the Committee debate on this bill I raised concerns about the revenue offset used to pay for this legislation. The original bill would have permitted the IRS to seize the as-sets of a taxpayer prior to a hearing. The pro-vision was scored as raising $240 million. The reason for the change was that there are some taxpayers who are serial abusers of the payroll tax withholding mechanism who need-ed to be shut down to prevent a drain on reve-nues. The problem is that we cannot begin to close the tax gap at the expense of basic civil liberties. We would have a taxpayer revolt at such heavy-handed tactics. Congress put in place many taxpayer protections against heavy-handed IRS tactics and I think we need to be very careful as we contemplate rolling back any of them in the name of closing the ''tax gap. '' The amended bill before us now would go after the serial abusers of the payroll tax sys-tem. It would require that if someone has al-ready been through the hearing process in the last two years, then they don 't get to keep scamming the tax system. They cannot hide behind the protections meant for taxpayers who have simply made a mistake in filing pay-roll taxes for their employees. The protection of having a hearing prior to IRS seizure of assets is important in many cir- cumstances. One of the leading reasons for this protection is innocent spouse relief. If a husband messes up his company 's payroll taxes in one quarter, the Committee approved bill and the version already approved by the other body, would have allowed the IRS to seize his wife 's assets and give her no ability to claim innocent spouse relief until roughly eight months after the seizure. I don 't think this is good policy and I think it is a lousy way to close the ''tax gap. '' I commend Chairman R ANGEL and Ranking Member M CCRERY for working to be sure that these situations are addressed by the amend-ment we have worked out. I hope that when-ever the House and Senate put this revenue raiser into a final agreement later this year, that the House version prevails. Again, I support the version of this legisla- tion that we are debating on the House floor today and I want to personally thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for working so hard to address these concerns. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. R ANGEL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1562, as amended. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f b2000 APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS TO JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BRALEY of Iowa).

CONGRATULATING NEW YORK HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONS Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. P ALLONE very much for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to con- gratulate East New York 's Transit Technical High School boy 's basketball team for winning the PSAL New York City Championship. The East New York Transit defeated Thomas Edison High School of Queens with a score of 52 -46. This is only the second time in the school 's history that the Transit boys ' basketball team made it to the State playoff. The first time was in 1993 when the team still played in the ''B'' division. I would also like to congratulate the staff of New York Transit Tech and its principal, Larry Kalvar, and its basket-ball coach, Michael Perazzo. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you please join me in honoring the boys ' basket-ball team at East New York Transit Tech High School for its outstanding accomplishment. I also rise to congratulate Brooklyn 's Thomas Jefferson High School girls ' basketball team for winning the PSAL A-league championship. The girls at Jefferson defeated New Town High School championship team to win the title, finishing with an overall 17 -1 record, making this the first girls ' bas- ketball team to represent the borough of Brooklyn in the State playoffs. My congratulations also goes out to the Jefferson High School principal, Michael Alexander, and the girls ' bas- ketball team coach, Calvin Young, for doing a marvelous job with the team. We need to recognize him as well. I ask that you all please join me in honoring the girls ' basketball team at Brooklyn 's Thomas Jefferson High School for this outstanding accom-plishment. Sometimes we criticize our young people about not doing what we feel is right, but here is a situation where some young people have done a very positive thing, and I think we should pause to salute them for that. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me also add my congratulations to the girls ' basketball team at Brook- lyn Thomas Jefferson High School. That is quite an accomplishment. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of H.R. 1132, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Pro-gram. The National Breast and Cer-vical Cancer Early Detection Program has had many proven successes in screening low-income, minority and uninsured women for little or no cost. The Centers for Disease Control esti- mates that between 8 and 11 percent of women nationwide are eligible for par-ticipation in this program. Since its in-ception in 1991, the early detection pro-gram has served almost 3 million women, providing more than 6.9 mil-lion screening examinations, and has diagnosed almost 30,000 breast cancers, 95,000 precursor cervical lesions, and 1,800 cervical cancers. There is a direct link between these statistical figures and the lives that have been saved. The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and the American Cancer Society have been instrumental in pro-moting the successes of the early de-tection program. I would also like to commend the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. B ALDWIN ) and the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. M YRICK ), a breast cancer survivor herself, who have worked tirelessly in bringing this legis-lation to the floor of the House and eventually to the President 's desk to be signed into law. I urge my col-leagues ' support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the sponsor of the bill, Ms. B ALDWIN . VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:44 H3155 March 27, 2007 Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, it is high time we reauthorize the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early De-tection Program. This important pro-gram provides breast and cervical can-cer screening to low-income, uninsured women who otherwise would have little or no access to such care. Early detec-tion is a woman 's most powerful weap- on against breast or cervical cancer be-cause early detection, followed by early treatment intervention, greatly increases a woman 's odds of beating cancer; and we know that our vigilance is having results as this is the second straight year of declining cancer deaths. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program is a Federal-State partnership that builds on the existing public health infra-structure and involves all sectors of the community in outreach and deliv-ery of services. Established in 1991, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early De-tection Program provides low-income women who have limited or no health insurance with breast and cervical can-cer screening, education, outreach, and case management services. Adminis-tered by the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early De-tection Program provides access to mammograms, pap tests, surgical con-sultations, and diagnostic testing. The program is operational in all 50 states, four U.S. territories, the District of Co-lumbia, and 13 American Indian or Alaskan Native organizations. The Na-tional Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program also works with nonprofit organizations that pro-vide supplemental funding for screen-ing, education, outreach, case manage-ment and treatment services. To date, the National Breast and Cer- vical Cancer Early Detection Program has provided nearly 6.5 million screenings to 2.7 million women, de-tecting almost 30,000 breast cancers, al-most 90,000 precancerous cervical le-sions and 1,700 cervical cancers. This reauthorization will strengthen this important program by increasing the program 's authorization level. At its current $205 million funding level, it is estimated that the program only provides services to 20 percent of all el-igible women in the United States. This additional authorization would enable the program to provide 147,000 more screenings per year. In addition, it will assist rural com- munities and special populations by permitting a five-State demonstration program for States to receive a time- limited waiver of current regulatory requirements in order to provide great-er emphasis on education and outreach, while ensuring that women continue to have access to life-saving screening services. I have been honored to work on this reauthorization, and I want to thank the American Cancer Society and the Susan G. Komen Foundation for their continued support of this critical pro- gram. In addition, I have been honored to work with my colleague, Congress-woman S UEMYRICK , in advancing this important legislation. In the war against breast and cervical cancer, we know that screening and early detec-tion saves lives. I am very proud and pleased that on this issue Republicans and Democrats are working together to support a life-saving program. I urge all of my colleagues to support this re-authorization. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. M YRICK ), the cosponsor of this legislation. Mrs. MYRICK. Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to be able to speak on behalf of this bill tonight in reauthor-izing the Nation 's breast and cervical cancer screening program in all 50 States. Many women around the country work hard but are uninsured and don 't qualify for Medicaid or other insurance assistance. This program helps to give them peace of mind when it comes to a disease that women often fear the most: Cancer. Many hardworking women would like to be responsible and get preventive screenings. But, as we all know, it is very expensive to do so without insur-ance. And it is even more expensive for all of us if these women go without screening and an undiagnosed cancer is allowed to progress. The early detection programs in our States and districts provide free and low-cost screenings, medical referrals, and education for women who may not otherwise have access to preventive tests. It is literally a lifesaver for women across the country, because breast cancer is still the most common cancer among women, and cervical cancer is very preventable. Thankfully, we continue to make strides against these diseases. Millions of women have been screened; and at CDC 's last count, they state the program has detected almost 30,000 breast cancers and over 1,700 cer-vical cancers. As a breast cancer survivor, I know how scary it is to hear those words, ''You have cancer. '' I can 't even imag- ine what it would be like to be told, ''But I 'm sorry, I can 't help. '' That is why a few years ago I intro- duced a bill that would allow State Medicaid programs to cover treatment costs for women who are screened through the program; and it passed the House with only one ''no'' vote in May, 2000. And of course 50 States do cover the treatment cost as well. We all know prevention is the most cost-effective way to fight the war on cancer, and this screening program saves money by detecting those can-cers early and steering women towards treatment options. It is also, unfortunately, estimated that less than 20 percent of the eligible women in the country are served by the program; and so the bill today pro-vides for enhanced preventive efforts and includes a structured limited waiv-er demonstration project through the Department of Health and Human Services to improve flexibility. States that can prove that they can increase the number of women served may apply to use the higher percentage of their Federal funding for outreach, education, medical training and other services. So, hopefully, some of the most vulnerable women will be reached. States must meet a series of require- ments in order to apply for the waiver to ensure that the Federal dollars are spent as efficiently as possible. Grantees across the country have ef- fectively leveraged the private dollars with the Federal money they receive; and, as others have acknowledged, I am grateful, too, to Susan G. Komen and the American Cancer Society and other groups for their dedication to the screening program. I am glad that this bill is on the House floor today; and I would like to thank the bill 's sponsor, Representa- tive T AMMY BALDWIN , for her hard work on this legislation. I would also like to thank Chairman D INGELL and Ranking Member B ARTON for their prompt con- sideration of this bill. I urge my col-leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1132. b2015 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Con-necticut (Ms. D ELAURO ), a champion on this issue. Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National Breast and Cer-vical Cancer Early Detection Program and its reauthorization. I commend the congresswomen who have spoken to-night, Mrs. M YRICK and Ms. B ALDWIN , for their dedication to this important program and for their work to ensure its continued success. Cancer is a disease that affects al- most all Americans in one way or an-other. It is as indiscriminate a disease as you can find. It does not care about your age, your family, your sex, your race, your religion. It reminds us that we are human and we are vulnerable. But as every sur-vivor knows, it brings out our resil-ience, our strength, and it makes us value and really savor every moment of our lives afterward, and I can say that as a survivor of ovarian cancer. It has also taught us just how critical early detection can be; and when de-tected at its earliest stages, the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is near-ly 98 percent. When detected at its ear-liest stages, the 5-year survival rate for cervical cancer is more than 92 percent. However, many women have limited access to life-saving early cancer de-tection. So in 1990, Congress created a Na- tional Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, and I was VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:44 Mar 28, H3156 March 27, 2007 proud to be part of that effort. It pro- vides access to critical breast and cer-vical cancer screening services for un-derserved women in the United States, especially those at high risk for breast cancer, including minority women and women with a family history of breast cancer. Since its launch, the program has served more than 2.9 million women, and it has provided more than 6.9 mil-lion screening examinations and diag-nosed more than 29,000 breast cancers; 94,000 precursor cervical lesions; and 1,800 cervical cancers. Any way you look at it, these numbers represent in-credible success, and they translate into lives saved. We have made tremendous progress in the fight against cancer, but there is no doubt we have a long way still to go. Today, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Pro-gram reaches only 20 percent of eligible women. We need to work together to make sure that all women can take ad-vantage of the medical advances we have seen, so that everyone has a fight-ing chance of beating this disease. That is why this legislation is so im- portant. It provides this critical and proven program with the resources for 147,000 more screenings per year. Through a five-State demonstration project it extends assistance to rural communities and special populations, providing an emphasis on education and on outreach, while ensuring that women continue to have access to life- saving screening services. Reauthorization is critical. We know that more challenges lie ahead, and so we must keep up the drumbeat. Out-reach, education, screenings: these make early detection possible. They make beating cancer possible. They are powerful tools that give us real hope. We do a lot of things in this institu- tion. We deal with roads, bridges, any number of parks. This is life and death. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Indiana (Mr. B URTON ). Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speak- er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank S UEMYRICK who has worked on this for such a long time, along with the gentlewoman from Wis-consin for sponsoring this bill. It really is so important for people to be screened early. I do not think there is a family in the United States that has not been touched by some form of cancer; and if you catch it early, the life expectancy can be extended a great deal of time, and in many cases, it can be cured. We had a personal experience in my family. In fact, I lost my first wife to cancer, and I think in part it was be-cause there was not early detection of that cancer. So one of the things that I think is most important is that women and men get screened for var-ious forms of cancer. There is prostate cancer in men. There is cervical cancer for women. There is ovarian cancer. There is breast cancer. There needs to be early screening. That is one of the reasons why D AR- RELL ISSAand I cosponsored Jo-Anna 's Law to make doctors and patients aware of the signs of cervical cancer very, very early so that women can be saved from terminally being ill. It is so important that they learn about these things before they get out of hand. I cannot express enough and I think S UEwill tell you this, I cannot express enough the pain that a family goes through when they find out that one of their loved ones is terminally ill and it could have been prevented if you had found out about it early enough. That is why I think this is such a great pro-gram. I am glad this reauthorization is tak- ing place, and I thank S UEonce again for working so hard on this. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Wis-consin for working so hard on this. I thank you for yielding the time, and I would just urge anybody who is paying attention to this discussion tonight, and a lot of people are not, get detec-tion early. Get screened early. It will save your life. It will save your family a lot of heartache if you learn about these things before it is too late. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Or-egon (Ms. H OOLEY ), a member of our Health Subcommittee. Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding and for all the work that he has done on this. I also thank Ms. B ALDWIN and Mrs. M YRICK for all of their hard work and their commitment to this. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program is vital to help promote the well-being of low-income and uninsured women throughout the country. The 5.8 mil-lion screening examinations provided under the program have saved lives. More than 22,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and over 1,500 with cervical cancer through the program 's screening. Early detection of breast and cervical cancer can mean the difference be-tween life or death. For breast cancer, the 5-year survival rate is 95 percent when caught early. Given what we know about the importance of early de-tection, I believe it is critical to pro-vide this screening assistance to low- income or uninsured women. I am also pleased that this reauthor- ization gives more flexibility to rural communities as they try to use these funds. The situation is so different in rural communities. Their outreach has to be different, and the fact that this bill acknowledges that, I am very pleased about it. This is an important, life-saving measure. It needs all of our support, and I thank the gentleman for the time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, the gen- tlewoman from Oregon is indeed cor-rect: this is important, life-saving leg-islation. Early detection expands the treatment options available to women who are afflicted with this disease. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just wanted to mention, Mr. Speak- er, that screening for, and early detec-tion of, breast and cervical cancer re-duces death rates and greatly improves cancer patients ' survival. Sadly, there is a low rate of screening among women of certain racial and ethnic mi-norities and among under- or uninsured women, which creates disparities in health outcomes. Since 1991, this program has served more than 2.5 million women nation-wide, provided more than 5.8 million screening examinations, and diagnosed more than 22,000 breast cancers, 76,000 precursor cervical lesions, and 1,500 cervical cancers. This bill reauthorizes a program vital to the health and well-being of women nationwide. I just want to thank again Representatives B ALDWIN and M YRICK for their hard work on this legislation and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1132. Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1132. Today in our country, millions of families are faced with the agonizing emotional and finan-cial stress caused by a loved one who has cancer. In fact, every year cancer claims the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans, making it our country 's second leading cause of death. The financial costs of cancer on our society are also enormous, and it has been estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that, in 2006 alone, the cost of cancer was an astonishing $206 billion dollars. This Congress must do more to accelerate the pace of cancer research, and to help alleviate the immense suffering of so many of our citi-zens. This bill is a small step that could have a significant impact on the lives of many women across our country. Every year, too many women fail to receive crucial preventative screenings because they do not have the means to see a doctor. Along with a good knowledge of their family 's medical history, these screenings are the best indicators by which many women can determine whether they are at risk for common cancers. By pro-viding easy access to these screenings, this bill would allow women to determine whether they are at risk for cancer, allow them to de-tect any problems early, and prevent any can-cer from spreading, if it has already devel-oped. We already know that prevention is a key factor to stopping the spread of cancer. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize this reality and support this legislation because it would provide a crucial tool by which many women across our country could take control over their health and prevent the spread of cancer. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1132, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. This legislation will further the work of this impor-tant program within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The National VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:44 Mar 28, H3157 March 27, 2007 Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) is a federally-funded ini-tiative that provides access to breast and cer-vical cancer early detection services to low-in-come and underserved women. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among American women. Sadly, one in every eight American women \u2014an estimated 200,000 women this year alone \u2014will be diagnosed with breast can- cer according to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. The American Cancer So-ciety reports in ''Breast Cancer Facts and Fig- ures 2005 -2006 '' that 40,410 women lost their fights with breast cancer last year. In 2007, the American Cancer Society estimates that 11,150 cases of cervical cancer will be diag-nosed and about 3,670 women will lose the battle with cervical cancer this year alone. More must be done to provide access to early detection programs that have the potential to greatly reduce these staggering numbers. The NBCCEDP provides breast examina- tions, mammograms, pap smears, and a num-ber of other services to women who fall at or below 250 percent of the Federal poverty level. To date, this successful program has served nearly three million women and diag-nosed more than 29,000 breast cancers and 1,800 cervical cancers. Access to early detec-tion medical services is an important step in battling breast and cervical cancers. As the Chair of the Congressional Asian Pa- cific American Caucus ' Health Task Force, I am acutely aware of the high rates of cancer infections present in the Asian and Pacific Is-lander American communities. For instance, breast cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death for Filipino-American women, and cervical cancer strikes Vietnamese Amer-ican women five times more often than Cauca-sian women, according to the Asian and Pa-cific Islander American Health Forum. I am also all too aware of the disparities that exist for and the challenges that must be overcome by women from minority communities in order to gain access to screening and diagnostic services for breast and cervical cancer. The CDC reports that the number of new breast cancer diagnoses over the last ten years has remained stable or decreased significantly within ethnic groups other than Asian and Pa-cific Islander American. The prevalence of breast cancer diagnoses in the Asian and Pa-cific Islander American, however, has in-creased during the last 10 years. On Guam, we have a shortage of oncology- related services. There is no radiology treat-ment center on Guam. Our only oncologist re-cently left the island. Cancer early detection is an even higher priority for the people of Guam in light of the challenges we face each day to-ward gaining better access to cancer diag-nosis for those who may be at risk, better treatment for those battling the disease, and better long-term care for those who are sur-vivors. As someone who knows firsthand the im- pact that breast and cervical cancer can have on a family, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and ensure that we make early detection and diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer a national priority. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G ENEGREEN ). GENERAL LEAVE Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 727, legislation to reauthorize the Trauma Systems Planning and Development Act. This program, under the Public Health Service Act, was first author-ized in 1990 to improve and coordinate trauma care in our country. Since then, this program has pro- vided $30 million to States to establish state-wide and regional trauma sys-tems. Injury related to trauma is the leading cause of death for younger Americans, ages 1 through 44. Trauma also causes more than 300,000 perma-nent disabilities each year. For seriously injured individuals, the first hour after an injury is when med-ical care is most effective in saving lives and function. This hour is also often referred to as the ''golden hour, '' during which trauma and emergency systems must respond both quickly and efficiently. This golden hour is also the goal that our military has for getting medical attention to our soldiers injured on the battlefield. The military has an im-pressive, streamlined trauma system that my colleagues Dr. B URGESS ; our ranking member at that time, Con-gressman D EALfrom Georgia; and our late colleague Dr. Norwood from Geor-gia and I marveled at during our trip last summer to Iraq, where we toured the military 's trauma facilities in Balad. Unfortunately, the military 's trauma system is not replicated in civilian health care, and too many Americans do not benefit from trauma systems that facilitate medical intervention during this critical time frame. While the death rate from trauma is 50 percent higher in rural areas than in urban locations, trauma affects each corner of this country. In fact, nearly 25 percent of all Americans sustain in-juries each year that require medical attention. Yet without coordinated trauma systems and quick access to care, injuries are too often fatal. In Houston, we learned this lesson the hard way when the lack of trauma VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3160 March 27, 2007 coordination forced a young man to wait more than 4 hours to receive care after he was hit by a car on Halloween night in 2001. With serious head, chest and leg injuries, this patient was clear-ly medically unstable and should have received immediate care at one of Houston 's two level-one trauma cen- ters. But with the trauma centers in-creasingly on diversion, this young man was transported to Austin where he died the next day. It was clear that we needed better trauma systems in the Houston area, and we quickly learned that the prob-lem was felt throughout our Nation. We also learned that the effective trau-ma systems would help prevent nearly 25,000 deaths each year. As a response, we developed this leg- islation to build on the program 's ini- tial success since 1990, and we author-ized it through 2012. This bill includes changes to the pro- gram to ensure that scarce health care dollars go to the communities most in need, ensuring that Federal funds are utilized to strengthen trauma systems and improve communication and co-ordination among different trauma sys-tems. It specifically ensures that grants go to States that coordinate planning for trauma systems with State disaster emergency planning and bioterrorism hospital preparedness planning. In addition, this legislation would re- quire the Secretary to update the model plan for the designation of trau-ma centers and set triage, transfer, and transportation policies. The legislation also reauthorizes the Residency Training Program in Emer-gency Medicine in an effort to ensure an adequate level of ER physicians to treat patients in need of care from America 's trauma centers. I would like to thank Mr. B URGESS from Texas for his leadership on this legislation and for helping to craft the compromise before us today. I would also like to thank Chairman D INGELL and our Health Subcommittee Chairman P ALLONE for their interest in this issue. We have been working on this bill for 5 years. Until now, this important issue failed to receive the attention it deserved, so I appreciate my chairman including this bill on our first markup in this Congress. I also appreciate the hard work that John Ford, William Garner and Pete Goodloe of the committee staff put in to guide this bill through the com-mittee to ensure that we have a con-sensus product to approve today, and also my own staff who has worked on this for at least 3 years. b2030 I also appreciate the support of the American College of Surgeons, the American Osteopathic Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, the American Trauma Soci-ety, the Coalition for American Trau-ma Care and the Emergency Nurses As- sociation. The members of these groups are on the front lines and know that coordi-nated trauma systems can literally save lives. We thank them for all they do for our communities. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, at this point, I yield such time as he may con-sume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. B OUSTANY ), who has intimate, firsthand knowledge of this issue. Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my col- league from Texas for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, prior to coming to Con- gress, I was a practicing cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon with extensive experience in open heart surgery, as well as trauma surgery. But I want to speak about the importance of this bill not as a physician but as a parent of a son who was in a severe car accident. About 6 years ago, I will never forget this, this was a Wednesday night, about 11:30 in the evening, and I re-ceived a phone call from the hospital from a friend of mine who is an emer-gency room physician who told me, was your son driving a black Alero? I said, what do you mean, ''was''? He went on to say, ''Well, I think he 's going to be okay. '' He started to read off the litany of injuries that my son had. So I immediately rushed over to the hospital, and I didn 't think about it, but I happened to be on call for chest trauma that night, so I was worried that I might have to operate on my own son. I get to the hospital and found out that he was in the emergency room, sitting there for about 3 to 4 hours. He was in shock. There was no organization with regard to prioritization of his injuries. I immediately jumped in and started kind of prioritizing things, and we managed to get him stabilized. He went through some extensive surgery that night. He subsequently had to be trans-ferred to another hospital 180 miles away for further treatment of his ex-tensive orthopedic injuries. Because of lack of trauma coordina- tion at that hospital, he developed se-vere malnutrition, lost about 50 pounds, had a lack of coordination with his antibiotics, developed infections, and spent nearly 6 or 7 weeks in the hospital, followed by about 3 to 4 to 5 months of further care to get him back to where he could walk with crutches. Thankfully now, today, he is doing well. But if it wouldn 't have been for my personal experience as a physician, overseeing the care of my son, he would not have gotten the appropriate care, and that is because we didn 't have a coordinated trauma center. Trauma cannot be fragmented. It re- quires a coordinated effort by a team of experts. As was mentioned, the mortality rate from trauma is significantly higher in rural areas than it is in urban areas. There are nearly 20- to 25,000 trauma deaths each year that are preventable if we had the proper coordination. We have learned much from the mili- tary. Much of trauma surgery has evolved from military activity and stream of the wounded afterwards. There have been tremendous advances, but this does not translate to civilian area, where we do not have trauma centers. Clearly, this is a bill that is impor- tant, and I appreciate the committee for bringing this forward and the hard work that has been done. This bill will ensure that severely in- jured patients get coordinated care, get care by experts, by a team of experts, not just in the emergency room and the operating room but in the after-math, where it 's so critical to full re- covery and full rehabilitation. This bill will award grants to the States for planning, implementing and developing trauma care systems. The Institute of Medicine has said the availability of Federal funds through the Trauma Care Systems and Plan-ning Development Act appears to have helped increase the number of trauma centers and urged, in 1999, the reau-thorization of the Trauma Care Act. This bill is absolutely necessary. It 's critical, and it also will serve to build a trauma registry, which is so impor-tant, so that we can catalog these inju-ries and learn from these things so that we can actually improve trauma care further in the civilian arena. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It 's a superb bill. It 's an excellent bill. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we reserve the balance of our time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, as we have just heard, this is an important bill. Trauma is one of the most expen-sive illnesses that we treat in this country. I am so pleased today to stand in support of H.R. 727, the Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act of 2007. In 1990, the Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act created title XII of the Public Health Service Act. This program was borne out of a report in which it was found that se-verely injured individuals in a major-ity of both urban and rural areas of the United States were not receiving the benefit of trauma systems, despite con-siderable evidence that a trauma sys-tem would improve survival rates. H.R. 727 requires the Health Re- sources and Services Administration to work with each State to help establish advanced trauma life support systems and to train EMS personnel for rural areas. Likewise, the program will help to make improvements in communica-tion and coordination with the larger State trauma systems. For Americans between the ages of 1 and 44, trauma is the leading cause of death. Traumatic injury in the United States, largely due to motor-related VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar March 27, 2007 trauma, totals $260 billion in costs. By reauthorizing this program, we will achieve the goal of ensuring that all areas of the United States have appro-priate emergency medical services. As the legislation is structured, enti- ties, either States or independent agen-cies, may compete for planning and de-velopment grants to help improve the trauma system and coordination in a given region. That is a distinct dif-ference from the trauma bill that ex-isted before. This bill is an improvement over the previous authorization because it will allow both States and other political subdivisions to work cooperatively to improve trauma systems. This bill also represents a more realistic authoriza-tion that will essentially act as start- up Federal funding for enhanced com-munication, enhanced coordination and data collection for States and other el-igible grantees. Certainly, I need to join my col- league from Texas in thanking Con-gressman B ARTON and Congressman DINGELL for their hard work on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, this has been a work in process for some time. My personal staff, Josh Martin, worked diligently on this bill last year. There were a number of issues with the other body which took some time to re-solve, but happily they were resolved before the end of the year. We are now able to support H.R. 727 in this Con-gress, get the bill passed and get this coordination of service where it is so badly needed. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G ENE GREEN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 727, as amended. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed bills of the following titles in which the concur-rence of the House is requested: S. 474.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P ALLONE ) and the gen- tleman from Texas (Mr. B URGESS ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members may have 5 legislatives days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consider-ation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The bill before us, H.R. 477, the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Preven-tion Act, amends the Public Health Service Act to strengthen education, prevention and treatment programs to improve health outcomes for stroke pa-tients. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in America and a major contributor to long-term disability. The American Heart Association re-ports that approximately 700,000 Amer-icans suffer from a stroke each year and that more than 150,000 die annu-ally. The AHA estimates that someone dies of a stroke every 3 minutes. H.R. 477 would authorize the Sec- retary of the Department of Health and Human Services to engage in activities designed to increase knowledge and awareness of stroke prevention and treatment. This legislation would re-quire the Secretary to conduct edu-cational campaigns, maintain a na-tional stroke registry and establish an information clearinghouse related to stroke. The bill would authorize the Sec- retary to make grants to public and nonprofit entities for the purpose of planning, developing and enhancing improved residency training programs and other professional training for ap-propriate health professions in emer-gency medicine, including emergency medical service professionals, to im-prove stroke and traumatic injury pre-vention, diagnosis, treatment and reha-bilitation. Finally, the bill would authorize the Secretary to make grants to States and public and other private entities to make medical professional training programs and telehealth networks that seek to coordinate stroke care and im-prove patient outcomes. The legislation has 86 cosponsors and is supported by the American Heart As-sociation, the American Stroke Asso-ciation, the American Physical Ther-apy Association and the STOP Stroke Coalition. I would like to personally thank Rep- resentative C APPS and Representative PICKERING for all their hard work on this life-saving legislation. I particu-larly want to thank Representative C APPS . I know how hard she has worked on this. I know, because of her background as a nurse, she brings to our attention on the subcommittee so VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3163 March 27, 2007 many bills and so many issues that are really important. I would thank her not only for this bill but for so many other initiatives. I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 477. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 477, the STOP Stroke Act. By passing this legislation, we are drawing attention to the dangers of stroke and heart dis-ease. As we have already heard, stroke is the third leading cause of death in this country, preceded by cardio-vascular disease and cancer, but clear-ly an important cause of death in this country. It is the most common cause of adult disability. As we have already heard, each year, more than 700,000 Americans suffer stroke, and 160,000 die from stroke-related causes. It is important to increase awareness and knowledge about stroke and stroke prevention. One of the key components of this legislation is that it allows the Secretary of HHS to establish pro-grams for education about stroke pre-vention. Additionally, the STOP Stroke Act provides federally funded grants to health care professionals at qualified entities to help educate them about the need for prevention, diagnosis, treat-ment and rehabilitation. Lastly, the legislation before us today includes a 5-year pilot program that provides grants to States and pub-lic-private entities for coordination of health care through telehealth net-works. I want to thank Congresswoman C APPS and Congressman P ICKERING for their work in bringing this legislation to the floor tonight. I urge my col-leagues to support the STOP Stroke Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the sponsor of the bill, Mrs. C APPS , such time as she may consume. Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague from New Jersey for yielding and for your leadership on this and the other health bills that we have been dealing with lately. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act, known as the STOP Stroke bill. I have been very proud to work on this legislation over several years with my colleague, Chip Pick-ering; and I am thrilled that it has come before the House today. I thank our staffs for all of us and those who have supported this legislation in the past, particularly calling to mind the groups that Mr. Chairman mentioned in support of the legislation, groups across the country made up of sur-vivors of stroke and those who are very interested in what we do here today. It has been mentioned that stroke is the Nation 's number three killer, a leading cause of long-term disability, and it 's also known but not widely un-derstood that stroke affects all age groups, not just the very elderly. It cuts through every socioeconomic and ethnic group. It really is a very signifi-cant destroyer of lives and homes and families, as it has such devastating re-sults as it affects people. b2045 Across this country, someone suffers a stroke every 45 seconds. In my State of California, stroke ac- counts for approximately 7 percent of deaths. In 2004, that amounted to near-ly 17,000 individuals. So many of these deaths due to stroke are preventable. Others are treatable. The staggering numbers of death and long-term disability due to stroke means that it is now time that we pass into law a comprehensive plan for pre-venting, for diagnosing, and for treat-ing stroke. H.R. 477 would accomplish this goal by authorizing the resources needed to implement coordinated stroke systems. The bill 's first initiative would cre- ate a national awareness campaign that would educate both patients and providers. Not enough people know the symptoms of stroke when it impacts them. We must standardize prevention and early treatment in order to achieve real results in our fight against stroke. In order to further improve education about stroke prevention, diagnosis and treatment, this bill will authorize grants for qualified health professional programs so that providers are equipped with the most up-to-date in-formation and technologies. H.R. 477 would also maintain the Paul Coverdell Registry, which serves as a clearinghouse of information about stroke care and best practices. And, finally, it would make up to seven grants available to conduct pilot projects on how we may be able to im-prove stroke outcomes through tele-health networks. I am very proud of this bill 's com- prehensive approach to improve our ability to manage stroke in the United States. Only when we tackle this disease from all angles, from prevention, from treatment, from coordination of care, can we really make progress. So I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 477. And I look forward to seeing it fi-nally signed into law. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, through the course of these three bills being brought by the Energy and Commerce Committee tonight, we have heard a number of stories. People have shared with us their personal stories. I saw on the news wires just this evening where a good friend of our committee, Jack Valenti, had been hospitalized with a stroke earlier this week. My own father suffered a stroke, May 23 of 1989. He, unfortunately, died 2 years ago this week. He spent the last 16 years of his life living with a dis-ability as a result of that stroke. The day that it happened, he lost the abil- ity to speak and never regained it prior to his death. Stroke treatment is so important and it has evolved over time. It wasn 't too many years ago where it was just simply a question of being certain about the diagnosis, making certain the stroke patient was stable, and then making arrangements for their reha-bilitation. But so much more can be done now. And we heard about the golden hour when talking about the trauma bill. Actually, for stroke victims, if treat-ment is rendered within the first 3 hours of a clot occurring, anti-clot medications, clot-busting medications, thrombolytic agents can be adminis-tered to restore significant function to that and prevent injury to that part of the brain that has been injured by, or been placed in jeopardy by, the pres-ence of a clot. Other strokes are caused by bleeding and blood vessel malformations within the brain; and one of our colleagues in the other body, indeed, suffered such an injury earlier this year. The treat-ment is vastly different. Clearly, those patients should not be treated with clot-inhibiting agents because they would be placed at greater risk. So the diagnosis of the type of stroke at the time of the stroke becomes crit-ical, and that is where the funding placed for the education and the med-ical research becomes so important. Further, it is my feeling that, as time goes forward, we will indeed improve the ability to help individuals who have been afflicted by a stroke. Additionally, the bill calls for the Secretary of Health and Human Serv-ices to establish programs educating the public about stroke prevention. And thanks to my good friends at mayoclinic.com, I would like to take just a moment to run through, to enu-merate those things that should be done for stroke prevention. And the number one issue is, if a person has hy-pertension, that hypertension needs to be controlled. If a person has high cho-lesterol, that needs to be lowered, ei-ther by modifying diet, a diet low in fat or a cholesterol lowering medica-tion such as a statin. No one should smoke in the United States today. If you are diabetic, control your blood sugar. Maintain a healthy weight. Ex-ercise regularly. Avoid stress. Don 't serve in Congress. Oh, that wasn 't on the list. Avoid stress. And if you do use alcohol or illicit drugs, perhaps you ought to think of another activity. These are very commonsense rec- ommendations. They have been devel-oped by, again, our good friends at Mayo Clinic. And I urge all Americans to consider incorporating those into their lifestyle. This is important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the legisla-tion. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, March 27, 2007 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Or-egon (Ms. H OOLEY ). Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, as a strong proponent of the American Heart Association 's GO-Red campaign aimed at educating women about heart disease and stroke, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act. This legislation will help reduce the 150,000 deaths that occur each year from stroke. Every 3 minutes someone dies of a stroke according to the Amer-ican Heart Association. To a stroke victim, delay means more dead brain cells. The most common type of strokes kills 1.9 million brain cells every minute. One study estimated that for every 12 minutes a stroke vic-tim delays treatment, a pea-sized por-tion of the brain dies. Fortunately, educating people about when to seek treatment makes a dif-ference. And I want to tell a story about a friend of mine. About 6 months ago, young woman, she happened to have another friend visiting her. And she woke up one morning and said, I don't feel very good. I can hardly lift my arm. And her friend that was vis-iting said, we are going straight to the hospital. She is doing very well in re-covery, not only because she is a very determined person, but she can also thank her friend for recognizing what was happening and getting her to a hospital immediately. By educating people about stroke symptoms and strengthening training programs for physicians, this legisla-tion will save lives and limit the dam-age to stroke survivors. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 477. Mr. PICKERING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Stroke Treatment and Ongo-ing Prevention Act. As the original cosponsor of the STOP Stroke Act, I would like to extend a special thanks to my colleague and the bill 's sponsor, Congresswoman C APPS for her tireless efforts to move this important legislation. Despite significant advances in its diag- nosis, treatment, and prevention, stroke re-mains the nation 's number three killer and a leading cause of long-term disability. An esti-mated 700,000 U.S. residents have a new or recurrent stroke each year, and about 160,000 of them die, according to statistics compiled by the American Heart Association. On aver-age, every 45 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke, and someone dies of a stroke every 3 to 4 minutes. Stroke is the number four killer in my home state of Mis-sissippi. In 2004, 1,651 people in Mississippi died of stroke. Mississippi ranks first in the na-tion for the highest death rate from heart dis-ease, stroke, and other cardiovascular dis-eases. Today 5.7 million Americans are stroke sur- vivors. As many as 30 percent of them are permanently disabled, requiring extensive and costly care. It is expected that stroke will cost the nation $62.7 billion in 2007. Prompt treatment of patients experiencing stroke can save lives and reduce disability, yet thousands of stroke patients do not receive the care they need. Additionally, most Ameri- cans cannot identify the signs of stroke, and even emergency medical technicians are often not taught how to recognize and manage its symptoms. Even in hospitals, stroke patients often do not receive the care that could save their lives. Rapid administration of clot-dis-solving drugs dramatically improves the out-come of stroke, yet fewer than 3 percent of stroke patients now receive such medication. The STOP Stroke Act is a first step toward removing these barriers to quality stroke care, thereby saving lives and reducing disability. The legislation addresses a number of signifi-cant hindrances to quality stroke care includ-ing low public awareness, lack of necessary infrastructure, low awareness among medical professionals, and lack of adequate data col-lection. The legislation will coordinate these various components. According to the American Heart Association, developing coordinated systems of care is essential to improving prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation for stroke pa-tients. The STOP Stroke Act authorizes a national public information campaign to educate the public about stroke, including how to reduce risk, recognize the warning signs, and seek emergency treatment as soon as symptoms occur. This legislation also authorizes the Paul Coverdell Stroke Registry and Clearinghouse to collect data about the care of acute stroke patients and foster the development of effec-tive stroke care systems. The clearinghouse will serve as a resource for States seeking to design and implement their own stroke care systems by collecting, analyzing and dissemi-nating information on the efforts of other com-munities to establish similar systems. The STOP Stroke Act also provides grants for public and non-profit entities to develop and implement continuing education programs in the use of new diagnostic approaches, tech-nologies, and therapies for the prevention and treatment of stroke. Stroke support can be de-livered to smaller, underserved facilities by re-lying more heavily on innovative telemedicine approaches that overcome the boundaries of time and distance to help rural hospitals tap into otherwise unattainable resources. Finally, this bill authorizes a telehealth stroke treatment pilot project to support states ' efforts to develop comprehensive networks to improve stroke prevention, treatment, and re-habilitation. These grants will allow states to identify stroke centers, improve communica-tion networks that bring stroke care to rural areas, and decease response time. The time has come for a bill such as the STOP Stroke Act. In fact, the time is past due. We are in a situation where stroke rates are on the rise, and we must address the issues that are going to help us match resources with the growing need to prevent and treat this devastating illness. I look forward to working with my colleagues in both Chambers to promptly move this legis-lation that has actually passed previously in both the House and the Senate. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I would yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P ALLONE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 477, as amended. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 269, I call up the bill (H.R. 835) to reauthorize the programs of the Department of Hous-ing and Urban Development for hous-ing assistance for Native Hawaiians, and ask for its immediate consider-ation.

Pursu- ant to House Resolution 269, the gen-tleman from Hawaii (Mr. A BERCROMBIE ) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. B ACHUS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Hawaii. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their re-marks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Hawaii? There was no objection. Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might con-sume. Mr. Speaker, with regard to H.R. 835, I would first like to thank very much Chairman B ARNEY FRANK and Ranking Member S PENCER BACHUS for their con- sideration of H.R. 835. It is imperative, from the point of view of Representative H IRONO and my- self, that we regard this bill as non-partisan in nature. And it was consid-ered that way in committee, and I am grateful for it. The bill was passed overwhelmingly last week 262 -162. It was under the Sus- pension Calendar and did not receive a sufficient number of votes for the two- thirds required margin, so we find the bill before us this evening. Of those 162 Republicans who voted ''no'' last week, 39 of them cosponsored the bill to create the Native Hawaiian Housing Title in the 106th Congress, in-cluding our good friend, Mr. B ACHUS , and minority leader J OHNBOEHNER . This reauthorization and improve- ments were requested by Hawaii 's Re- publican Governor, Linda Lingle. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is chaired by the former head of the State 's Republican Party. This bill was introduced last year by Congressman Ney and was reported out of the Financial Services Committee by voice vote without amendment. And last year 's Republican chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mike Oxley, was also a cosponsor of the bill. I bring these things up, Mr. Speaker, to emphasize that never have we ever considered this bill to be a partisan bill, a Republican or Democratic bill. This is a bill that affects constituents, regardless of their political affiliation, and is not ideological in nature. It is really administrative in nature. There have been some discussions and some arguments concerning some of the constitutional issues that have been raised in other contexts about na-tive people. This is not the venue to have that kind of a discussion or argu-ment. We do not want to harm those who come before us for legislative re-dress and expect to have it and not ex-pect to have an argument in which they will become grist for an ideolog-ical mill, grist for a disputation of an academic nature or of a philosophical nature, having nothing to do with the question at hand, in this instance, most particularly dealing with home-ownership, mortgages, and refinancing. I understand, and will defer to Mr. B ACHUS on this point, that Mr. R ENZI has made a statement of support in ad-dition, and I expect to hear about that when we yield to Mr. B ACHUS for his participation. Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize again that this is not a partisan bill. It is not really anything that should be considered other than on the merits of the subject matter at hand. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. And the first thing I would like to ac- knowledge is both my respect and friendship with my colleague from Ha-waii, Mr. A BERCROMBIE . I have enjoyed a long friendship with him, have the utmost respect for him, and I associate myself with the remarks he made. I be-lieve his remarks were fair and accu-rate. Not to parrot the Fox News net-work, but also fair and accurate. He has, I think, correctly pointed out, colleagues on my side of the aisle, some are supportive of this legislation. Others have concerns about the legisla-tion. And it is for that reason that we have asked for time on the floor just to express some of those concerns. At the same time, as the gentleman from Hawaii has said, we have some Members that strongly support this legislation. He mentioned the gen-tleman from Arizona (Mr. R ENZI), also the gentleman, D ONYOUNG , from Alas- ka, is a strong supporter of this legisla-tion. And a number of my colleagues also voted for the legislation. Others of my colleagues are con- cerned about some of the statements made in the Rice v. Cayetano case, that some of these benefits, and there are some 160 benefits that go to Native Hawaiians. And some of these benefits actually date back to statehood and, I think, the founding of the State of Ha-waii. So there is some historical basis for these. b2100 But, as I have said, some of my col- leagues are concerned about that. Some of them have pointed out the words of Justice Kennedy in that deci-sion where he said this: ''America is a melting pot of cultures from around the world. '' And he said, ''As the State of Hawaii attempts to address these re-alities, it must, as always, seek the po-litical consensus that begins with a shared purpose. One of the necessary beginning points is this principle: The Constitution of the United States too has become the heritage of all the citi-zens of Hawaii. '' And that Constitution, as we know, in almost all cases is opposed to racial set-asides. So this disturbs many of my colleagues on my side of the aisle. At the same time, as I said, there is some historical context for these, and I think probably utmost is that I think most people in Hawaii, several Repub-licans, officeholders as well as both members of the present Hawaii delega-tion, support these programs and be-lieve they greatly have benefited the people of Hawaii. Let me simply close by saying we had hoped to come united together in sup-porting this legislation. Mr. C AMPBELL in committee had offered an amend-ment, and in closing I will read that amendment. Had this amendment been accepted, we would have been prepared, I think, to almost unanimously to have supported this bill. Mr. C AMPBELL 's amendment said: ''Nothing in this title shall be con- strued to confer a constitutionally spe-cial political or legal relationship based on Native Hawaiian race or an-cestry between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people for pur-poses of establishing a government-to- government relationship. With that, Mr. Speaker, as I said, with great respect for Congressman A BERCROMBIE and also Congresswoman HIRONO , I appreciate the civility and the spirit of cooperation in which we come here tonight. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Briefly, Mr. Speaker, I am also very grateful to Mr. B ACHUS for his com- mentary and his observations and will indicate that, at least as far as this Member is concerned, there will be time enough, I believe, tomorrow to deal with the question should there be a recommittal offered on the issues that were raised by either the Camp-bell amendment or any of the other points that were raised as a basis or foundation for possible opposition to the bill. I believe they can be answered. I believe that this is fundamentally a very conservative approach that merits the support of Members across the var-ious ideological spectrums that exist here in the House of Representatives; and I hope, with the opportunity to speak about them at some length, per-haps tomorrow, that we will be able to VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3166 March 27, 2007 satisfy one and all here on the floor that this is a bill worthy of support. The principal thing I would say, just simply in quick response, is that the Rice versus Cayetano decision which was mentioned does not affect these programs, has literally nothing to do with the issue at hand in this H.R. 835. The decision invalidated an election system for a State agency, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a State agency. The decision did not affect the agency itself. It did not even question the va-lidity of the agency. It had to do with the question of who could vote for the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Af-fairs. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs still exists today. It exists for the benefit of Native Hawaiians and is voted on by the entire voting population of the State of Hawaii. So it had to do with an election issue and absolutely noth-ing to do with this, and the Court de-clined to address the question of Native Hawaiian programs authorized by Con-gress. So we are dealing with an en-tirely separate set of issues here, and I hope to make that clear tomorrow. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to Rep-resentative H IRONO . Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and my colleague for yielding time. I rise in strong support of H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Oppor-tunity Act of 2007 and ask for my col-leagues ' support of the bill. The Act assists the State of Hawaii 's Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, DHHL, to provide opportunities for homeownership for low-income native Hawaiians. The bill in no way address-es the question of whether or not Na-tive Hawaiians should be recognized as a sovereign entity akin to Alaska Na-tives or American Indians. During debate on this bill last Wednesday, no Member came to the floor to speak in opposition to the bill. In fact, the gentleman from Arizona, who managed the time, expressed sup-port for the bill. Unfortunately, either during the de- bate or afterward, e-mails were sent to Members containing at least two erro-neous assertions: first, that this bill is unconstitutional and, second, that this bill ''would confer on Native Hawaiians an arrangement like that between the Federal Government and American In-dian tribes. '' Opponents then com- pounded the error by citing the Rice v. Cayetano voting rights Supreme Court decision in support of their broad as-sertions. As to the first assertion, the con- stitutionality of any measure must be decided by the courts; and, clearly, the courts have not opined on the constitu-tionality of this bill. As to the second assertion, there is nothing in the bill that speaks to creating a political rela-tionship between Native Hawaiians and the Federal Government akin to the re-lationship between the Federal Govern-ment and American Indian tribes. This bill, which promotes home- ownership, a goal that all of us can support in bipartisan fashion, has been targeted for defeat by opponents who are misreading the bill as well as case law. I was a member of the Cayetano ad- ministration in Hawaii and sat in the Supreme Court when arguments in the Rice case were heard. It may interest some of you to know that one of the lawyers arguing the State of Hawaii 's case was John Roberts, who is now Chief Justice of our Supreme Court. The central issue in the Rice v. Cayetano case was the narrow question of whether the State of Hawaii could hold an election for trustees of the Of-fice of Hawaiian Affairs where only Na-tive Hawaiians could vote. In holding that the State could not so limit these elections, the majority opinion of the Court deliberately avoided the ques-tion of whether or not Native Hawai-ians deserved the same right of self-de-termination granted to American Indi-ans and Alaska Natives. Nothing in the Rice decision holds that programs that benefit Native Ha-waiians are unconstitutional. The ma-jority court decision did not call into question the trust relationship between the U.S. Government and the Native Hawaiian people. It did not strike down the Office of Hawaiian Affairs or any other program benefiting Native Ha-waiians as unconstitutional. While the entire Hawaii congres- sional delegation, Hawaii 's Governor, who happens to be a Republican, and the Hawaii legislature supports self-de-termination for Native Hawaiians, that is not the subject of the bill before us today. My colleague and I have intro-duced H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007, also known as the Akaka bill. We can discuss the merits of self-deter-mination for Native Hawaiians when and if the Congress considers that bill. The bill before us today provides as- sistance to a limited group of Native Hawaiians, those designated as bene-ficiaries under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921. That bill, in recognition of the desperate poverty and displacement from the land of Na-tive Hawaiians, established a home-steading program to place eligible Na-tive Hawaiians, or those with at least 50 percent Hawaiian blood, on lands in Hawaii designated for that purpose. The law was passed at the urging of the Territory of Hawaii 's delegate to Con- gress, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole. Some 200,000 acres were set aside for the purpose of providing Native Hawaiians with land. This 1921 Act of Congress has never been chal-lenged in the Supreme Court in the last 86 years. Despite the good intentions of the Congress, progress in meeting the goal of delivering land to Native Hawaiians was slow. Most of the Hawaiian home-lands were located in areas far from jobs, and infrastructure like roads and utilities were nonexistent. Many indi-viduals were on the waiting list for more than 30 years. The Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act of 2000 has provided the Department of Hawai-ian Homelands with much-needed re-sources to expand opportunities for homeownership among low-income Na-tive Hawaiians. Especially critical has been the ability to use these funds to develop the infrastructure that makes placing homes on these properties pos-sible. Because the issue of Native Hawaiian rights as a native people lies at heart of the opposition of this bill, I would like to quote attorneys H. Christopher Bartolomucci, Viet Dinh, and Neal Katyal, who stated in a February, 2007, legal document prepared for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs: ''Congressional legislation dealing with indigenous groups is political, not racial, in character and therefore is neither discriminatory nor unconstitu-tional. Rice v. Cayetano specifically declined to address whether 'Native Hawaiians have a status like that of Indians in organized tribes ' and 'wheth- er Congress may treat Native Hawai-ians as it does the Indian tribes '.'' As previously mentioned, we can and should have the debate on whether or not Native Hawaiians should enjoy the rights to self-determination given to other Native American groups when that bill is squarely before us in H.R. 505. Native Hawaiians deserve no less. This bill before us today simply pro- vides Native Hawaiians who are eligi-ble for homesteads under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act passed by Con-gress with the financing tools to allow them to realize for their families the dream of homeownership which other-wise would be available to very few of them. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mahalo nui loa. Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me say that I appreciate Con- gresswoman H IRONO 's discussing the bill and the different components of the bill and also Congressman A BER- CROMBIE . And let me say that I do ac- knowledge that low-income Native Ha-waiians living on the Hawaiian home-lands, that they are under some re-straints in building homes and financ-ing those homes; and, because of that, there is support on my side of the aisle for some of these programs, and there are some differences of opinion. So I do acknowledge that for them, because it is on Native Hawaiian lands, it is al-most impossible for them to get pri-vate financing; and that is at least the basis for some of these programs. And I do believe and I am hopeful that some of the discussions we have heard to-night will enlighten Members on both sides. It is not the intent of the minor-ity to obstruct the passage of this leg-islation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I am again very appreciative of Mr. VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 2007 BACHUS for his perception, his perspec- tive, and his judgment with regard to the bill. Mr. Speaker, I have no further re- quests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time except for 5 min-utes. Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 5 minutes of my time, and I yield back the balance of my time, also. b2115 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to section 2 of House Resolution 269, further proceedings on the bill will be postponed. f GENERAL LEAVE Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on H.R. 1132, as amended.

Under a previous order of the House, the gentle-woman from North Carolina (Ms. F OXX) is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, as part of the Constitutional Caucus, we try every week to raise issues that are of concern to us, because dealing with the Constitution, observing the Constitu-tion and honoring the Constitution is very, very important to us. It is the basis of everything that we do here in the Congress and should be the basis of every lawmaking body in our country. So tonight I want to talk a little bit about the first amendment and a con-cern that I have about an assault that has been made on the first amendment by a previous Congress. The first amendment clearly states that ''Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. '' Our Founding Fathers understood the vital role that free speech played in the health and functioning of our democ-racy. They lived under the restrictions of colonial England, and were very in- tent on creating a new system of gov-ernment that respected the right to speech and political expression. One of the strongest proponents of the Constitution 's Bill of Rights, Pat- rick Henry, said: ''Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. '' Today, as Mr. Henry advised 200 years ago, I look with suspicion at some of the legislation that has emerged from this body. I am sus-picious that we have at times not given adequate attention to the ''public lib- erty'' that Patrick Henry so strongly urged us to guard. Congress must take great care when attempting to control political expres-sion. But, unfortunately, this has not always been the case. In the past, Con-gress has created laws which restrict organizations ' rights to participate in the electoral process. The First Amendment Restoration Act, H.R. 71, would restore America 's first amendment rights by repealing the ''electioneering communication '' provision in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, known as BCRA. This provision stifles the speech rights of corporations, nonprofits and labor unions. They are prohibited from sponsoring no-PAC funded radio and TV advertisements that include any references to Federal candidates during the 30 days before primary elections and 60 days before general elections. This is a severe infringement on these organizations ' constitutional rights to free speech. It communicates to them that they have no right to voice their views during elections. It is a clear violation of the first amendment to restrict the speech of organizations and limit what people can say about a candidate and when they may say it. The Supreme Court, unfortunately, upheld the constitu-tionality of these restrictions on groups in the days leading up to an election. But the Supreme Court has erred in the past. This bill offers a much-needed correc- tion to the Bipartisan Campaign Re-form Act. The 30/60 day BCRA provision was an attack on the primary purpose of the first amendment 's free speech clause, which is the protection of polit-ical speech. This bill fully restores those rights which were hampered by BCRA. We must be vigilant and heed the words of America 's founders. They knew firsthand the democracy-choking effect of restrictions placed on political speech. But the minute we begin to craft laws that hamper expression, we demonstrate we have forgotten the priceless lessons of liberty that have been fought for by the patriots who have gone before us. I urge my colleagues to support the First Amendment Restoration Act, H.R. 71. f GENERAL LEAVE Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on the subject of my Special Order tonight. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. f NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORKER MONTH AND WORLD SO-CIAL WORK DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Texas (Mr. R ODRIGUEZ ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a former social worker serving in the United States Congress, and I rise to honor the work of professional social workers across the country and throughout the world. I would like to join my colleagues in the National Association of Social Workers in recognizing March as Na-tional Professional Social Work Month and today as World Social Work Day. Today we have the opportunity to ac-knowledge the important contributions that social workers make in our com-munity and throughout this country. Today the House overwhelmingly passed H. Res. 266 to recognize the goals and ideals of National Profes-sional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day. This legislation of-fered the Congress a valuable occasion to support professionals who have helped individuals, families, and com-munities resolve complicated issues and make significant choices. My experience as a social worker had a profound influence on my decision to enter public life. I could see that many of the challenges facing my clients and those that I worked with had stemmed from the decisions being made at the public policy level. Serving in Congress allows me to be able to continue to help my clients in a broader capacity. Social work as a profession is a com- mitment to not only addressing the in-dividual needs of clients, but also in creating a just system. As a Member of Congress, I work every day to create a just system for the American people. This year, the theme of National Pro- fessional Social Work Month is ''Hope and Health. '' This theme allows us to highlight the considerable involvement of social workers in the health profes-sion. Social workers often work coopera- tively with doctors, nurses and other medical professionals to ensure that their clients receive the highest qual-ity care. Care and attention provided by social workers begins when the cli-ent enters the health care profession and does not end until he or she has re-covered. When dealing with health care, social workers will most often act as coun-selors and therapists. In that capacity, they must help the client and his or her family understand the diagnosis, the illnesses, and the emotions in-volved. In addition, social workers pro-vide much-needed advice and support VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 27, 2007 regarding the difficult health care deci- sions that clients must make. In fact, professional social workers provide more mental health care than psychologists, psychiatrists and psy-chiatric nurses combined, making them the largest provider of mental health services in this country. These services are also extended to our Nation 's veterans. Professional so- cial workers provide counseling, sub-stance abuse treatment, crisis inter-vention and other services to veterans and their families. At a time when our Nation is in- volved in wars both in Iraq and Afghan-istan, it is important that our return-ing soldiers have access to the compas-sionate care that social workers pro-vide. The Department of Veterans Af-fairs employs over 4,400 social workers to assist American veterans, including those returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for joining me in sup-port of H. Res. 266 yesterday and for honoring and paying their respect to our country 's professional social work- ers and the services they provide. I want to take this opportunity also to indicate that as a former social worker, I had the opportunity not only to teach 11 years in the School of So-cial Work, but also serve as a case-worker for heroin addicts for about 3 years, where I had the opportunity to serve directly with individuals that also had substance abuse, including ad-olescent substance abuse. I also had the privilege of working in the commu-nity mental health area, where I had an enjoyable practice and enjoyed working with individuals. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all the social workers throughout this country for the services they provide. f A STRANGE REWARD FOR HEROIC ACTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Colorado (Mr. T ANCREDO ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor as I have so many times in the past to address an issue dealing with our extradition policy. Mr. Speaker, a gentleman by the name of Duane Chapman, a bounty hunter that goes by the name of ''Dog,'' faces the strangest of rewards for heroic action. In 2003, Mr. Chapman received a tip regarding the whereabouts of a million-aire by the name of Andrew Luster. Mr. Luster was a convicted felon who had fled as an escapee from the California Department of Corrections 6 months earlier by jumping $1 million bail on charges that he drugged and raped three women. He was also on the FBI 's Most Wanted List, convicted and sen-tenced to a term of 124 years of impris-onment in absentia for 86 counts of rape, drug and weapons offenses. Mr. Chapman went to Mexico to act on this tip and was accompanied by a local Mexican police officer. He was also in communications with U.S. offi-cials, who were aware of his activities. Much to his credit, Mr. Chapman suc- cessfully located Mr. Luster and appre-hended him. However, on the way to the jail to book Mr. Luster, Chapman 's police escort disappeared, strangely. As a result, Mr. Chapman was detained for several days on the relatively minor charge of deprivation of freedom and conspiracy. Mr. Chapman then re-turned to the U.S. after posting bail. Thanks to Dog, a serial rapist is now rightly serving a 124-year sentence and the situation seemed to have worked out for the best. But now, years after the fact, it seems that the Mexican Government is intent on extraditing and prosecuting Mr. Chapman. Incred-ibly, our State Department seems to have no problem being complicit in these proceedings. I have written the Department of Justice at least once and the Depart-ment of State several times just asking them to justify what they have done. I wanted to figure out exactly what their reasoning is for handling this specific case in this way. There are a lot of legitimate ques- tions. For instance, how is it possible that the Department of Justice would decide to use taxpayer resources to send U.S. Marshals to Hawaii to take Mr. Chapman into custody? b2130 This is an administration that rou- tinely tells Congress that they cannot secure our borders and immigration system due to lack of resources. We are told that the U.S. Attorney 's Office in the border States are simply over-whelmed with cases and cannot pros-ecute all of the violations, even very serious ones. We are told that ICE can't possibly tackle the task of de- porting illegal aliens from the interior of our Nation. We are apparently sup-posed to accept the presence of roughly 100,000 criminal aliens inside our bor-ders, a number that is growing every year, while the U.S. Marshals track down a successful bounty hunter in-stead. After formally apprehending Mr. Chapman and putting him into a bevy of new legal proceedings, the question of extradition is raised. Though my ob-servations of our extradition treaty with Mexico indicate that it is not ab-solutely binding, conventional wisdom has seemed to assume that the treaty between the U.S. and Mexico requires Chapman 's extradition. But it is just this, conventional wisdom. It is not part of the treaty, apparently. I am not the only one to question whether extradition ought to proceed. One recent news story reported that al-though the U.S. and Mexico informally agreed to recognize trans-border cap-tures by bounty hunters as extra-ditable offenses, this provision was never fully incorporated into the extra-dition treaty. The report indicates that this ''informal '' addition to the treaty came after bounty hunters captured a gentleman by the name of Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a Mexican physician implicated in the torture and execution of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agent. Al-varez-Machain maintained that his capture violated the U.S.-Mexico extra-dition treaty. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Al- varez-Machain 's claim in 1992. In the decision, Justice Rehnquist wrote that the treaty ''says nothing about the ob- ligations of the United States and Mex-ico to refrain from forcible abductions of people from the territory of the other nation, or the consequences under the treaty if such an abduction occurs. '' That is his quote. Mexico 's Government was upset by the decision which gave rise to its ''in- formal '' addition to the treaty. Alan Kreczko, then deputy legal adviser to the Secretary of State, then James Baker, said in congressional testimony that the U.S. and Mexican govern-ments had exchanged letters recog-nizing that trans-border abductions by so-called bounty hunters and other pri-vate individuals would be considered extraditable offenses by both nations. This international dispute should have remained amicably resolved by virtue of the fact that justice has clearly been served in the case of ''Dog'' Chapman. But now that these events have been set in motion anew, the best resolution in which we can hope for would come from the Mexican government and judiciary when they dismiss the charges pending against the Chapmans and also to withdraw their request for extradition. Let's just say that I am not over op- timistic for this stand by Secretary Rice to refuse extradition to Mr. Chap-man, and I hope this good deed does not go unpunished. f The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BRALEY of Iowa). Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE) is recognized for 5 minutes. (Ms. LEE addressed the House. Her remarks will appear hereafter in the Extensions of Remarks.) f NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORK MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from New York (Mr. T OWNS ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to- night to honor America 's social work- ers. This month provides us an oppor-tunity to highlight the essential role that social workers play in alleviating some of America 's most difficult prob- lems. Professional social workers are found in every facet of community life, in-cluding our schools, our hospitals, mental health clinics, senior citizen fa-cilities, elected office, private prac-tices, prisons, among our military per-sonnel, and the list goes on and on. VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3169 March 27, 2007 I have had the opportunity to work with some outstanding social workers or to be involved professionally with them. I have been involved with Dr. Roger Witherspoon, who is a great so-cial worker, Mr. Levander Lilly, Ruby Bullock, Betty Williams, Mark Handelman, Ed Pitt, Dr. Joe Jackson, Sam Hodes, and I can go on and on be-cause of my many years of being in-volved in the field of social work. This year 's theme for National Pro- fessional Social Workers Month is ''Hope and Health; Help Starts Here. '' This theme reflects the important work being done by social workers in the health care field. Social workers involved in health care often work within a multidisci-plinary team which includes doctors, nurses and other medical professionals. This is an approach to ensure quality care for patients and their families. I am grateful for the leadership and expertise that the members of the Na-tional Association of Social Workers provide to the people of America and, of course, around the world. Social workers in all disciplines use their col-lective power every day to strengthen our Nation 's families and communities, help individuals overcome adversity, and advance sound social policies. The commitment and dedication of social workers to create a more positive envi-ronment for all of our people is to be commended. Last year, the National Association of Social Workers released the results of a national study which warns of an impending shortage of social workers that threatens future services for all Americans, especially the most vulner-able among us, our children and our senior citizens. Throughout history, social workers have addressed the needs of society and brought our Nation 's social problems to the public 's attention. As one of the 10 proud social workers of the House of Representatives, today I know first-hand how social workers across this country advocate for the humane, fair and beneficial policies for all of our citizens. So I salute all social workers during this National Professional Social Work Month; and I say to my colleagues around the board, social workers make a great contribution to the improve-ment of the quality of life for so many people in this country. f DENOUNCING THE GOVERNMENT OF BELARUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Illinois (Mr. S HIMKUS ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, on Sun- day, March 25, approximately 7,000 citi-zens of Belarus gathered together in commemoration of the 89th anniver-sary of the short-lived Belarusian Na-tional Republic, which was formed on March 25, 1918, when Belarusians pro-claimed their independence from the Russian empire. Unfortunately, only 10 months later, the Red Army entered Minsk, quashed this democracy and set up the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Re-public. On Sunday, the brave men and women of Belarus gathered together to commemorate their ancestors ' drive for democracy and independence al-most 90 years ago and express their own desire to live in free and demo-cratic Belarus. This group had planned to assemble in October Square in cen-tral Minsk to start their peaceful march towards the National Academy of Sciences. However, participants ar-rived at this public square to find it blocked by riot police, and trucks and busses were forced to split into several groups. One group decided to march to the Sport Palace and reassemble there. When they got to that destination, they were met by a large number of po-licemen warning that if they did not leave within the next 5 minutes, spe-cial measures would be taken against them. Several minutes later, the first clash between the police and protesters took place, with several people beaten and arrested. Former presidential can-didate Aleksander Milinkevich and his wife were among those hit and knocked to the ground. Finally, the group managed to break through and march to the National Academy of Sciences, where they were able to meet up with the rest of the group; and a rally was held. Partici-pants included young people and fami-lies with children. They shouted slo-gans, sang songs and waived red and white Belarusian flags and banners which read ''Freedom to Kozulin and freedom to political prisoners. '' While speaking to the crowd, former presidential candidate Aleksander Milinkevich declared that ''Democratic Belarus will prevail, as truth and God are on its side. Under the weight of its lies, this regime will fall, but we should give it a push with our strength, our loyalty and our love for the homeland. We should do this in a peaceful man-ner, as Belarusians don 't like violence. We are peaceful people and have not shed anyone 's blood. It is our blood that has been shed and our people are in prison. '' Yet in spite of the peaceful nature of a crowd and Mr. Milinkevich 's public assurances that the pro-democratic forces carried a message of peace, the police continued to try to break up the rally. Police set up loudspeakers which continually interrupted the rally speakers, warning the group that their actions were illegal, that they had not received permission to hold a rally at the National Academy of Sciences, and if they refused to leave, physical force would be used against them. Forty peo-ple were arrested on March 25th alone. Many people were also beaten with po-lice batons. Leaders of the pro-democratic forces Milinkevich, Victor Karnyenka and Valentina Polevikova, were among those hit by security forces ' batons, with Ms. Polevikova suffering a head injury. What is additionally disconcerting is that 60 additional activists were ar-rested on March 23rd and 24th in the lead-up to the rally in a shocking inci-dent. Prominent pro-democratic activ-ist and mother of two, Krystsina Shatsikava, was abducted by unknown men and forced into a car at 4:30 p.m. on Friday, March 23rd. She was later brought to a mental hospital in Mogilov, where she said that she had been tied to a bed and given an un-known injection at the hospital. She was finally released today. The young woman was a prominent activist fol-lowing the fraudulent presidential elec-tions in March, 2006, and had repeat-edly declared her intention to partici-pate in the March 25th rally. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I find it ap- palling that 7,000 peaceful protestors gathered together to commemorate an anniversary of national independence and freedom, only to have their voices crushed once again by the current re-gime of Aleksander Lukashenko. I denounce the government of Belarus for its actions against these peaceful protestors and demand that they release all the activists who were jailed for their participation during the leading up to the March 25th rally. I also, along with our European col- leagues, once again urge the govern-ment of Belarus to allow its citizens to exercise their right to assemble peace-fully and express their views freely. f The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under a previous order of the House, gentle-woman from Ohio (Mrs. J ONES ) is rec- ognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud recognition of World Social Work Day. First off I would like to extend my gratitude to all social workers for the important work they do. It is selfless work that impacts the most impoverished and sick among us. Your hard work assists millions of individuals, families and communities across the country and the globe. I have always been a strong advocate for social workers. The field of social work can be a thankless profession which is not very lucra-tive, so having fully trained professional social workers is always a blessing. In the 108th and 109th Congresses, I introduced a bill that would provide loan forgiveness to social work-ers who work for child protective agencies. I hear from students all the time who express desire to work as a social worker, but may choose a different field in order to be able to pay for their education. I want to encourage people who are inter- ested and have a desire to become a social worker, and not have them choose a different career based on the cost of their education. Their work is vital to my community and to all communities, and we need to encourage young people 's interest in social work. This year 's theme for National Professional Social Work Month is ''Hope and Health. '' My home is Cleveland, Ohio, and we have been rated as one of the most impoverished cities in the nation. With so many individuals unem-ployed and unable to provide for themselves or their families, a strong social worker pres-ence is vital for my community. Thirty-two percent of Clevelanders live below the poverty line. Almost half of the children live below the poverty line compared to a national average of 18 percent. Nineteen percent of those children lack any type of health coverage. There are over 21,000 social workers in the state of Ohio, and the majority of them work in the fields of Mental Health, Child and Fam-ily Welfare, Health, and Aging. I would like to highlight North East Ohio Health Services, which is a behavioral health care organization that provides services to the residents of Cuyahoga County. They have many programs that reach children through seniors in crisis intervention to continuing care. I am grateful for organizations like North East Ohio Health Services that employ social workers to assist my constituents with the greatest need. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all my colleagues in the House who are social work-ers, and especially Congressman C IRO RODRIGUEZ for arranging this special order to recognize World Social Work Day. And I would like to reiterate my deepest respect and admiration to all the people who choose to de-vote their lives and careers to providing a helping hand to the most desperate among us. f The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under the Speaker 's announced policy of Jan- uary 18, 2007, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. H ENSARLING ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, to- night we start an important debate that we have here each year in this Na-tion, and that is a debate over the an-nual budget. I know for a lot of people, Mr. Speaker, this is a debate about numbers, kind of a green-shade visor exercise, but frankly, it is a lot more than that. It has a lot to do with val-ues. It has a lot to do with principles. b2145 And it is a debate that the American people need to pay very close attention to. Clearly, we know the results of the last election: there is a new majority party. The Democrat majority has taken control, which they have not had in 12 years. They won the election fair and square. But, Mr. Speaker, the more things change, the more they stay the same. I have the pleasure and honor of serv- ing on the House Budget Committee, and just this last week the Democrats voted out their budget that has the sin-gle largest tax increase in American history in it. Now, Mr. Speaker, the last time that the Democrats had con-trol of the House, guess what they did, they passed the single largest tax in-crease in American history. Again, the more things change, the more they stay the same. The single largest tax increase in American history. Mr. Speaker, people have to know what this is going to mean to them. I have the honor and privilege of rep- resenting people in the Fifth District of Texas. It starts out in the city of Dallas, takes in the southeast Dallas County suburbs, and six really great east Texas counties full of small busi-ness people and agricultural producers. For the people in the State of Texas, for the people in the Fifth District of Texas, that is going to mean an addi-tional tax burden for the average fam-ily of four of $2,700 a year. That is $2,700 a year, Mr. Speaker, that could have gone into funding the family budget that is instead going to go into funding the Federal budget. And every time, every time that we increase that Federal budget, we are taking money away from some valuable family budg-et. Now, we are always going to hear from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, that these vital investments are needed for hous-ing programs and for nutritional pro-grams and health care programs. And certainly we need a social safety net. But, Mr. Speaker, this isn 't really a de- bate about how much we spend on these vital programs. The real question is, who is going to do the spending? Democrats believe government should do the spending. We believe that fami-lies should do the spending. And when it comes to my constituents in the State of Texas, they need that $2,700. They need that $2,700 to help send a child to college, to help finance higher education. They need that $2,700 to VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar H3171 March 27, 2007 make a down payment on their first home and help realize the great Amer-ican Dream for their family. They need that $2,700 a year to help with long- term care for an elderly parent. I mean, these are the priorities of Amer-ican families. Where do we believe that somehow we have all this perfect knowledge in Washington, D.C.? I mean, Mr. Speak-er, how much is enough? The single largest tax increase in American his-tory is now being proposed by the Democrats, and what is this going to do? What is this going to do to families all across America? Every family in America who is paying attention to this debate ought to go and look at their checkbook, and every night, every week they have to get around that kitchen table and they have to make priorities, something that Con-gress isn 't particularly good at, and they have to decide how they are going to meet their bills. And yet here is the Democrat major- ity saying, well, we need an extra $2,700 a year from your family because we know better than you do about the health care you need and the education you need. You can 't handle that your- self. We need to do it for you. That is just one difference, one dif- ference that we have. Because in the Republican budget, we know the Amer-ican people work hard for their money. We know they roll up their sleeves and work hard to put food on the table to feed their family, to put a roof over their family 's head. There is no tax increase on the poor beleaguered taxpayer, no tax increase on American families, no tax increase on small businesses in the Republican budget. But what do you find in the Democrat budget? The single largest tax increase in American history. Now, Mr. Speaker, I have been joined by a number of my colleagues tonight who know a lot about what this Demo-crat budget would mean to their con-stituents and would mean to their peo-ple back home. I am very happy that we are joined by the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. F OXX), and I would like to yield to her to get her perspec-tive on this single largest tax increase in American history. Ms. FOXX. I thank you, Congressman H ENSARLING . And I want to thank you for setting the stage for this discussion tonight. As you said, it is the begin-ning of many times when we need to be bringing this issue up. I also want to thank you for your leadership of the Republican Study Committee, our party group of conservatives that raises issues every day here on the floor and in committee meetings on the things that the American people be-lieve in and that we fight for every day. Let me reiterate some of what you said and then add some points about North Carolina and raise some other issues that you have not yet gotten to. As you said, under the assumptions in this proposed budget, we will see the largest tax increase in our Nation 's history. And I think we need to keep saying that over and over and over again. The Democrat budget increases taxes by $392.5 billion over 5 years, shattering their last record tax in-crease of $240 billion in 1993. In fact, they would raise taxes, increase taxes by $231 billion in 2012 alone. But the hits just keep coming; and as you pointed out, it is the same playbook that they used in 2003 all over again. It is more than just a reckless policy that endangers the strength of our economy; it is a cause for serious con-cern for the livelihood of the constitu-ents of the Fifth District in North Carolina and, in fact, people all over North Carolina. We would see in North Carolina more than 3 million taxpayers whose bills would go up. And it wouldn 't be just a little bump, either. The average tax increase for the 3.1 million North Carolinians would be $2,671. That is a lot of money. This stark reality underscores the truth of my Democrat colleagues ' ap- proach to the Federal budget. They know that the more money they can get out of Americans ' pockets, the more money they can spend to expand the Federal Government. That is not what we need. This approach is com-pletely backwards. We should be look-ing first to put money back into tax-payers ' pockets, not taking it out. Furthermore, this current budget proposal is a squandered opportunity to reform spiraling Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid costs and to give Americans the permanent tax re-lief they deserve. Instead, it allows widespread tax increase that hit mid-dle-income families, low-income earn-ers, families with children, small busi-nesses, and others. Some people would see more than a 100 percent increase in their taxes. For example, an elderly couple with $40,000 in income would see a tax increase of 156 percent in 2011, from $583 to $1,489. And a family of four with $60,000 in in-come would have a tax bill that would rise from $3,030 to $4,893 in 2011, an in-crease of more than $1,850, or 61 per-cent. And these increases are no accident. The Democrats were warned. During budget markup I know that my col-leagues introduced many amendments which were all rejected, and these would have prevented the tax in-creases. But they would not listen. But the budget proposal again isn 't a real surprise. It is business as usual for the Democrats and proves that their promises to be fiscally responsible are just empty rhetoric. If this budget is approved, it will signal a return to the Democrats ' beloved tax and spend model for government. If you take a look also at the more than $20 billion in pork that was added to last week 's troop emergency funding bill, it becomes crystal clear where the Democrats stand on spending. And, worse, they prove they don 't mind using our troops as bargaining chips. Democrats have willfully abandoned their pledge of fiscal responsibility. We have talked about it before. They are being very hypocritical in terms of what they promised and what they have done. They pledged to follow pay- as-you-go spending rules and spending restraint to curb the deficit. And then we get this budget which would give us again the largest tax increase in the history of this country and ignore the larger consequences for our economy. These tax increase are going to threaten to reverse the substantial def-icit reduction that has occurred in the past several years. We have increased tax revenue from 16.5 percent of GDP in 2003 to 18.5 percent this year, exceed-ing the average percentage of the past 4 decades. This is a result of those tax cuts that we passed. Tax revenue grew by 14.6 percent in 2005, 11.5 percent in 2006, and already 9.3 percent in the first 5 months of fiscal 2007. This revenue growth was the principle factor in re-ducing the budget deficit from $412.7 billion in 2004 to an estimated $214 bil-lion this year, according to the Con-gressional Budget Office. Let me give just a couple more exam- ples of again how people are directly going to be affected by this tax in-crease and to show the hypocrisy of the Democrats who say all the time that they are trying to help low-income and middle-income people. It will raise the 10 percent tax rate bracket to 15 per-cent. This will give a tax increase to 5 million individuals and families who don't pay taxes now but would become subject to the individual income tax in 2011 if the Democrats are successful in raising the 10 percent tax bracket to 15 percent. It eliminates the marriage penalty relief that we have had; 23 mil-lion taxpayers would see their taxes in-crease on average by $466. It cuts the child tax credit in half; 31 million tax-payers would see their taxes increase on average by $859 in 2011. Every working American would be af- fected by the Democrats ' tax hike. We have to bring this message to the American public and show them why the Republicans are fighting so hard against this budget that is going to be brought up by the Democrats. And, again, Congressman H ENSARLING , I applaud your efforts through the RSC and through the Budget Committee for helping us put together this Special Order and giving these facts about the largest single tax increase in American history being proposed by the Democrats. Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gen- tlewoman for her leadership in this body on issues that are important to taxpayers of America and taxpayers of North Carolina. Again, Mr. Speaker, we are very priv- ileged tonight to have Republican members of the House Budget Com-mittee and members of the Republican Study Committee, the conservative caucus within Congress, Congress ' larg- est caucus, made up of people who want to further the conservative cause of VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3172 March 27, 2007 more freedom and more opportunity and limited government and account-able government, and people who un-derstand that every time we inflate the Federal budget we are taking money away from the family budget. Again, this single largest tax in- crease in history that the Democrats are proposing may fuel their vision of Big Government, but it doesn 't do much to help fuel the budgets of fami-lies throughout our Nation, including some families in the State of Nebraska. And I am very happy that we have been joined by one of the outstanding freshmen Members within our GOP ranks. At this time I would yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. S MITH). Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. H ENSARLING ). It is good to be here this evening as we discuss, I believe, an im-portant aspect of our future. Later this week we will begin debat- ing the majority party 's budget resolu- tion. It promises to balance the budget by 2012 without raising taxes and with significant increases in both discre-tionary and mandatory spending. Basic math tells me this is impossible. The majority party 's budget assumes the expiration of all of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts by adding those revenues into the budget over time to bring it into balance. Chasing higher spending with higher taxes, Mr. Speaker, will fail to address the unsustainable growth of government and will undo everything our economy has accomplished. b2200 Even as our Nation faced tremendous challenges over the past few years, the strategy of economic growth through tax relief has delivered significant def-icit reductions, including job growth. If we are to raise taxes to balance the budget, entitlements would quickly drive us right back into the deficit, just at a higher level of taxing and spending. With the retirement of the massive baby-boom generation looming, this situation will grow more serious, not less so. Most importantly, however, from an agricultural point of view, the majority party 's budget promises more than $110 billion in increased manda-tory spending in selected issue areas. They address this by creating 10 so- called reserve funds for specific items like health care, education and the farm bill. Agriculture gets a $20 billion ''reserve '' fund to be released at the discretion of the Budget Committee chairman. Sounds like a good deal, well, until you read the details. This farm bill reserve fund can only be made available if the farm bill would not increase the deficit or de-crease the surplus through 2017. In other words, to get the $20 billion, it must be offset by spending cuts or tax increases. This is either a shell game to give the impression of increased fund-ing with no substance, or it is part of a larger plan leading to tax hikes, and I believe it is a part of a larger plan that would lead to the largest tax increase in American history. It is interesting to note that in Ne- braska this tax hike would cost the av-erage Nebraskan, with over 656,000 tax-payers in Nebraska, an average of over $2,800 per taxpayer. My friends in Wyo-ming, almost $3,200 per taxpayer. My neighbors in Colorado over $3,000; Kan-sas, almost $2,900; South Dakota, al-most $2,600 per taxpayer. What concerns me the most, Mr. Speaker, is that sitting through sev-eral long hearings in the Budget Com-mittee because it is certainly an im-portant topic, we heard from the ex-perts, and I would say the experts of the experts, who gave us clear warn-ings that we must reform entitlements. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Mr. Bernanke, in the Budget Committee on February 28, 2007, said, ''Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth of entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost. '' The Comptroller General, Mr. David Walker, also in a Budget Committee hearing, on January 23 stated, ''Health care is the number one fiscal challenge for the Federal and State governments. It is the number one competitiveness challenge for American business, and it is a growing challenge for American families. If there is one thing that can bankrupt America, it is health care. We need dramatic and fundamental re-forms. '' Mr. Walker went on to say on ''60 Minutes '' that the rising cost of gov- ernment entitlements are a fiscal can-cer that threatens catastrophic con-sequences for our country and could bankrupt America. Even the Democrat chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has ac-knowledged, ''It is always easier to defer, to kick the can down the road to avoid making choices. '' Mr. Speaker, I rise with great con- cern about our future. I am concerned that when it comes to fiscal policies we have ignored the past, we haven 't learned our lessons, and that we expect spending into prosperity, taxing into prosperity, and there is a law of dimin-ishing returns. We know that is not a sustainable situation, and we have to practice fiscal responsibility because what concerns me the most is that the more we delay the decision, the tough-er the decision becomes. I know as we look at this budget and the revenues it necessitates are not sustainable with those policies. I rise out of great concern and look forward to a good, hearty debate as we address these issues that are so important to middle-class America. Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gen- tleman for his contribution. I thank him for his leadership within the fresh-man class. Again, Mr. Speaker, people need to know that once a year we come to-gether and as a Nation debate what the Federal budget ought to be. There are clearly those who think that the Amer- ican people are undertaxed, and I sup-pose that is why the Democrats have proposed the largest single tax increase in American history. But talking to working mothers in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, talking to small business people and talking to farmers and ranchers, they don 't seem to think that they are undertaxed. They think that Wash-ington spends too much. But, instead, the Democrat response is almost $400 billion of tax increase. Nationwide, that is about $2,400, $2,500 per family of four that is going to be taken out of the family budget and put into the Federal budget if they succeed in their largest single tax increase in American history. They are going to eliminate the mar- riage penalty relief. They are going to bring back the marriage penalty so people who fall in love and get married have to pay more taxes than if the two were single. They are going to cut the child tax credit in half. They are going to cut it in half as working families and work-ing mothers all over America are struggling to meet the needs of their children and of child care. And for the working poor, this one is so hard to believe, but for the working poor in the 10 percent bracket, they are going to raise their taxes 50 percent. Fifty percent, Mr. Speaker, on the working poor and take them back to the 15 percent bracket. Where does it all end? I myself hail from the Lone Star State of Texas. We are what is known as a sales tax State. We do not have a State income tax. We are very blessed that we do not have one. Yet there has been this inequity in the Tax Code that allows taxpayers who come from a State income tax State to deduct their taxes, but for those of us from a sales tax State, we don 't have that benefit. Well, the Republicans knew that was not equitable, and we passed tax relief so all Americans would enjoy tax re-lief, whether or not they are from a sales tax State or a State income tax State. Now under the Democrats ' plan, under the single largest tax increase in America 's history, they are going to bring back the penalty if you happen to hail from one of these sales tax States. Mr. Speaker, I am very happy that we are joined tonight by another Mem-ber who comes from one of those sales tax States, one of the great leaders of the Republican Study Committee, one of the co-authors of the American Tax-payer Bill of Rights. At this time I yield to the gentlewoman from Ten-nessee (Mrs. B LACKBURN ). Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank you so much. I am really appreciative that you have mentioned sales tax deduct-ibility. As the gentleman from Texas knows, that is something that I worked feverishly and diligently to have passed when I came to this body in 2003, re-storing that deductibility of sales tax to our Federal income tax filing for VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3173 March 27, 2007 those of us who live in non-State in- come tax States. Now whether you are from Wash- ington State or from Nevada or from Texas or from Florida or Tennessee, my home State, you have been able to enjoy a sizable deduction. Our col-leagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, are willing to do away with that as they go about passing the largest tax increase in American his-tory, the single largest tax increase in American history. They are going to do it all in one bill and all with one fell swoop. You know, as I have listened to the debate on both sides of the aisle gath-ering around this budget, it has re-minded me of something that we have talked about on this floor before, Mr. Speaker, and it is that the budget should reflect the priorities of the peo-ple of this great Nation, not the prior-ities of government. Mr. Speaker, what we have right be- fore us is a classic liberal elite bureau-cratic document. It is all about grow-ing the bureaucracy. It is about power to Washington, D.C., and not power to the people in our districts. It is clear as day. I am really kind of glad that the Democrats have brought this budget forward. It defines so clearly the prior-ities of our parties. b2210 Are you for the bureaucracy or are you for the people? Are you for tax re-lief or are you for tax increases? Are you for middle class, hardworking Americans or are you for the liberal elites? Are you for those liberal elites that want to tell you they are smarter than you and they ought to be telling you exactly how to spend your money or are you for the taxpayers that are right now sitting at home at their kitchen table trying to figure out how much they owe the IRS and they are looking at the end of the month com-ing up and they have more month left over than they have money left in that checking account and it is because they know the government never gets enough of the taxpayers ' money? Mr. Speaker, my constituents know this Federal Government does not have a revenue problem. This Federal Gov-ernment has a spending problem, and our colleagues across the aisle would be well-served to learn that lesson. Whether you go back to the New Deal or the Great Society, all these pro-grams that have been put in place and have to be grown and have to be fed, government never gets enough of your money because of this. Now, in Tennessee, because of all the bookkeeping gimmicks of the Demo-crats, and they ran on one set of prior-ities but now they are governing like what they are, the liberal elites, and it is going to cost 2.1 million Tennesseans $2,600 per family. If they want to go vote to raise the taxes on the constitu-ents in their district, have at it. Let them line up and vote to raise the taxes on the people that live in their districts. But the people in my district in Tennessee do not want to pay more in either State or Federal taxes. They want to see their taxes reduced. They want to see the size of government shrink, and they want to see better fis-cal management and responsibility of the resources that the government has. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I look forward to con-tinuing this debate. I look forward to working hard to defeat the Democrats ' tax increase which is the single largest tax increase in American history. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing to the floor very important aspects of this debate. Again, Mr. Speaker, I just do not know how anybody can justify this sin-gle largest tax increase in American history, almost $400 billion of taxes that are going to get imposed on Amer-ican families. In Texas, it is going to be taking away $2,700 on average from every family of four. I mean, that is impacting real families in Texas. It is taking away from their family budget. Mr. Speaker, I recently contacted my constituents and I asked them if the Democrats are successful with their plan to put forth the single largest tax increase in American history, what is it going to mean to you? Well, I heard from Diana in Mesquite, and she said: Congressman, I wanted to let you know that I am a single mom that does not receive any type of child support, and an increase of this amount would break me. I would be at risk of losing my home with this type of increase. I am writing to ask your help to keep this from happening. This would be devastating to middle-income families and families in my situation. Again, Mr. Speaker, every time you plus-up, you increase the Federal budg-et, you are taking away from the fam-ily budget. You are taking away from Diana 's budget in Mesquite, as she works to try to keep her home. I heard from Brian who came from Dallas, and I asked him, and he said: Congressman H ENSARLING , the loss of $2,700 would affect our ability to pay tuition and books for our daughter to go to college. While she is a junior this year, we are trying to save money for her education, and as the cost of edu-cation increases each year, the loss of these funds due to an increase in taxes will have a negative impact on our plans for her education. Again, what the Democrats are doing with their single largest tax increase in American history is they are getting the family budget. They are making it more difficult. They are making it more difficult for Brian to be able to send his daughter to college. There is no fairness in this. There is no compas-sion in this. I have heard from many other con- stituents and the Democrats have to realize once again how devastating this is to American families. It is not their money, Mr. Speaker. They did not earn it. It belongs to the American people. It is their money. They need to use it for their education program. I think it is again important to point out that if the Democrats are success-ful in their plan to engage in the single largest tax increase in American his-tory, it is going to take away from American families their ability to send their children to college. It is going to take away from their ability to pur-chase their first homes. It is going to devastate the family budget so that Democrats can bulk up on the Federal budget. This is not fair, Mr. Speaker. This is not right. Another gentleman who has been a great leader within our conference and a great leader in the Budget Com-mittee and somebody who represents the people of south Alabama very well in this institution, who knows about the devastating impact that this Dem-ocrat budget could have on family budgets, is the gentleman from Ala-bama, and I would be happy to yield to Mr. B ONNER . Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I thank the Speak-er for allowing this Special Order to proceed. I thank Jeff for organizing this. This is important for the American people in Texas and California and Alabama and all over this great country to un-derstand what the Democratic major-ity is doing this week by unveiling their budget, and a budget that we will have to vote on. As my friend from Texas will appre- ciate and certainly as the majority of my constituents back home in south Alabama know, I do not often come to the House floor every time there is an open microphone just to offer my view on whatever the topic of the day hap-pens to be. Instead, I remember the words of my father who although I was only 13 when he passed away, he told my brother, Jim, my sister, Judy, and me that you learn a lot more from lis-tening than you do from talking. So usually I prefer to sit in the back of the chamber, this building, this awe-some chamber that we are so privileged to serve in, and listen to the give-and- take, the back-and-forth of the debates that have helped to define our time. Sadly, however, on this particular evening, I feel moved to come off that back bench so as to speak up and to voice my real concern and, quite frank-ly, my real disappointment that now that they are back in power after 12 years of being out, our friends on the other side of the aisle have chosen with their budget to revert back to their old familiar habits. b2220 Because when all is said and done, that is what this budget will do. In a single sweep, in the snap of a finger, this Democratic budget will give to the American people the single largest tax increase in American history. If all of that sounds familiar to you, then perhaps there 's a reason for that. You see, the last time the Democrats VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3174 March 27, 2007 were in control of Congress, they, too, gave the American people what was, at that time, the largest single tax in-crease in American history. Of course, that was back in 1993, when they had the help of President Bill Clinton to sign the bill into law. Fortunately, at least for the time being, President Bush has a veto pen that hopefully will keep these tax increases from becom-ing a reality. But one thing is for certain. It didn 't take the Democrats long, just 77 days from the time they took over the ma-jority on January 4 of this year, to roll out their plan to raise taxes, yet once again on the backs of hard working Americans. Now, Mr. and Mrs. Middle-Class American Taxpayer, I know some of you may be sitting at home tonight working on your own taxes. In fact, I called a constituent of mine in Mobile just last night, and that is what he told me he was doing, working on his tax returns for 2006. After all, April 15 is just 19 days away. So this topic of rais-ing taxes on America 's families couldn 't be more timely. Congressman H ENSARLING , I don 't know about you, but I don 't recall a single time in any of my years of being in Congress, either as an elected Mem-ber or in the 18 years that I worked for my predecessor, Congressman Sonny Callahan, I don 't recall a single time where a constituent came up to me, not at a town meeting, not at a Rotary Club, Lion 's Club, Kiwanis Club or the like, and somebody came up to me and said, J O, old buddy, you know the Fed- eral Government needs more money. Why don 't you just take some of mine? Nor have I had anyone come up and say, Congressman, there is not an ounce of waste in the Federal Govern-ment. Washington, DC, is a lean, well- oiled machine. You all could use a lit-tle bit more of my money. Here, take whatever you need. Correct me if I am wrong, but I doubt the gentleman from the Fifth District of Texas has ever heard any of his con-stituents make the statement to him. Mr. HENSARLING. We should obvi- ously inform our Democrat colleagues that last I looked, the IRS takes vol-untary contributions. So if they don 't believe their taxes are high enough, if they don 't believe the taxes of their constituents are high enough, they can simply add a zero to that line on the 1040 and send in more. They somehow act that there is a revenue deficiency in Washington, DC. I don 't know how much government spending is enough, but just looking over about the last 10 years, I see where the agricultural budget has in-creased 126 percent, the Federal trans-portation budget, 97 percent, the edu-cation budget, 75 percent, Medicare has increased 137 percent, all at the same time where the family budget has in- creased about 36 percent. The Federal budget is outpacing the family budget by 3 to 1, 4 to 1. That cannot continue. So, again, we come back to the basic question. Is Washington spending too much, or are the American people undertaxed? I think the gentleman from Alabama has hit the nail on the head. Mr. BONNER. I thank the gentleman, and I know that he has done the math for his constituents in the Dallas area of Texas. I have done the math for peo-ple of south Alabama as well; and, if enacted, what the budget will mean to the average Alabama household is not good news. In fact, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there are ap-proximately 4.4 million people who are proud to call Alabama their home. If this tax increase is enacted, it will mean that the average tax-paying Ala-bama household will owe another $2,500, $2,500. Friends, that is a lot of money to most folks back in my dis-trict in Alabama and I think in every district in America. But if they have to write an addi- tional check for $2,500 more to Uncle Sam, if this Democrat budget is en-acted, then that likely means no braces for the kids. It means that you won 't be able to set aside money this year for your children going off to college, and it certainly will mean there will be no family vacation. Sadly, the Democratic majority must think either the Federal Government can spend the American people 's hard- earned tax dollars better than they can, or that the Federal Government simply shouldn 't be asked to make a sacrifice when there are so many wor-thy programs yet to fund. Either way, the Democratic majority is making quite a statement this week, a state-ment that I hope the American people will listen closely to as this debate unfolds. You see, as my friend, Mr. H ENSARLING from Texas, knows all too well, as do my other Republican col-leagues on the House Budget Com-mittee, last week when the Democrats passed this budget out of committee, they had an opportunity some 32 dif-ferent times, I have got the amend-ments in my hand, to accept some rea-sonable tax relief for the American people by putting into writing their commitment to not raise taxes. Now, in fairness, J EB, you will recall many of our Democratic colleagues on the committee, they were quick to say, well, wait a minute, we don 't want to raise taxes, well, not all of them, at least not now. But actions speak louder than words. Their actions, unfortunately, speak much louder than the lack of their words in that document. This is noth-ing short of the single largest tax in-crease on the American people. Quite frankly, it 's a sad day for the American taxpayer. Time after time, House Republicans on the Budget Committee tried to amend this budget with commonsense amendments that are overwhelmingly supported by the majority of the Amer-ican people, amendments such as the one that our colleague, Congressman J ONPORTER of Nevada, offered to pre-vent a tax increase on middle-income families with children. That went down on a party line vote by the Democratic majority. The amendment by our friend, Con- gressman M ARIO DIAZ-BALART of Flor- ida, who offered to prevent an increase of the onerous and, I think, the most unAmerican of all taxes, the death tax that, if the Democratic majority doesn 't do anything, will go back to 55 percent in just 4 short years. That amendment also went down on a party line vote by the Democratic majority. Congressman H ENSARLING , you re- member your amendment, you had many, but this one in particular, J EB, to dedicate funding to protect Amer-ica's veterans. Did it pass? Mr. HENSARLING. No, it went down again on a straight party line vote. It was a very simple amendment. Budgets are about priorities. At a time our Na-tion is fighting this war on terror, it was a very simple amendment. It said, you know what? Whatever figure we decide is the right figure for veterans ' funding, and I know you can never give enough, but whatever it is, let 's make sure we put a floor under it. Let 's give it a firewall. Because too often what we find out in what we call the appropria-tions process up here, sometimes these funds get raided for other purposes, just like Congress has too many times raided the Social Security fund. So this was a simple amendment that said we are going to put a firewall around veterans ' spending, and the number that we put in the budget is sacrosanct. Every single Democrat on the Budget Committee voted against that amendment. They voted against veterans. It was not a proud day for the institution. Mr. BONNER. Congressman H ENSARLING , I know there are others here tonight who want to speak out against this single largest tax increase of American history. I don 't want to be accused of hogging microphone. But, instead, I would like to close for my part by asking the American tax-payer a very simple question. Time after time our Democrat colleagues have come to this floor over the past few months and said the American peo-ple voted for change on November 7. It was all about change. Well, if this Democratic budget passes and if our taxes go up, and they most certainly will, then that is about all the Amer-ican people are going to have left after these tax increases go up, is a little change. Is that really the message you were sending on November 7 of last year? J EB, you have two beautiful children, Claire and Travis. Janee and I have two beautiful children back home in Mo-bile, Alabama. I hope they are all asleep right now, Lee and Robbins. This is really about the future of our children and grandchildren. There are a lot of good Democrats and a lot of good Republicans who have children and grandchildren who are concerned about them. This Democratic tax increase VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:29 Mar 28, H3175 March 27, 2007 and this Democratic budget is nothing about the children. Unfortunately, it 's about the government. I thank the gentleman for this spe- cial order, and I appreciate his leader-ship on fiscal responsibility. b2230 Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gen- tleman for his contribution this evening. I thank him for his leadership on the Budget Committee. And he has brought up a very important point, Mr. Speaker, that we have yet to talk about this evening, and that is, as the Democrats offer up their single largest tax increase in American history, that is like the appetizer. That is the appe-tizer. As the gentleman from Alabama talked about his family, and he has a wonderful family, and we all think about our children and our grand-children, but do we really think enough about them? Because let me tell you, the single largest tax increase in his-tory is just the start. The Comptroller General, the Chief Fiduciary Officer of the Federal Government has said that if we don 't begin to reform entitlement spending, this spending explosion in Washington, unless, as a society, we find a better way, a smarter way to de-liver health care and retirement secu-rity at a more reasonable cost, we are going to be on a path to double taxes, double taxes on our children and grand-children in just one generation. And that is why I say, the single largest tax increase in American history, that is just the appetizer. The entree is, be-cause the Democrats have no reforms, no reforms of entitlement spending in their budget whatsoever, which is the single largest fiscal challenge we face, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Reserve Chairman, the Secretary of Treasury, anybody who is responsible for fiscal or mone-tary policy in America, the Democrat budget is silent on it. They are putting us on a path to double taxes on our children. And the Comptroller General, and I paraphrase, has said, we are on the verge of being the first generation in American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. And as the father of a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old, I will not stand idly by and let that happen. I will raise my voice about this single largest tax in-crease in American history. Mr. Speaker, we are joined by an- other great freshman member of the Republican Party who has been out-spoken on these budget issues and somebody else who hasn 't lost his abil- ity to be outraged on how this will im-pact, the single largest tax increase in American history will impact the peo-ple in his district. And I am happy now to yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. J ORDAN ). Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I thank him for his work with the Republican Study Committee. His leadership there is just so valuable. Mr. Speaker, let me just make a cou- ple of points about this tax increase that has been talked about this last hour, this largest tax increase in the history of the United States of Amer-ica, why it is such bad policy for our country. And I want to just focus, as I said, on two points. First of all, I think it 's important to recognize how the competition is stiff-er today. And what I mean by that is this changing dynamic that we see in the world market. There was a point maybe in the past where elected offi-cials, where politicians could afford to make poor decisions, poor policy deci-sions and because America 's economy was so far ahead of the rest of the world, we could succeed in spite of the bad policies that were enacted. But the facts today are such that it is impor-tant we get it right and we not put ad-ditional burdens on families, on tax-payers, and on our economy if we are going to compete in this world market. Just a couple of facts. Think about this: China has 1.4 billion people. The country of India has 800 million people. The United States of America, we just hit a population of 300 million last summer. So, again, two countries, over two million people that we are com-peting against. China 's economy is growing at about 10 percent. India 's is growing at about 7 12percent. If we are going to compete against those emerg-ing countries who are moving towards middle class, if we are going to com-pete, we have got to have the right kind of policies in place. Tax increases are not the right kind of policies on our families, on our business owners, on our American economy. It is impor-tant we recognize that. I have related this story to the Chair of the Republican Study Committee be-fore, but I think it captures just how important it is to understand the dy-namic that we find ourselves in in this point in history. We have a constituent who has been very successful in manufacturing. And he wanted to, a few years ago, sit down with our United States Senator and talk about this dynamic that is taking place in the world market. And so we helped put together a meeting, and he sat down with our United States Sen-ator around the conference table. He took one of the pieces, the piece that they make in their manufacturing plants and he had taped to that piece, he had two pennies taped to it. And he slid that piece across the table to our U.S. Senator and he said, Senator, those two pennies taped to that piece, those represent, those two pennies rep-resent our labor costs in that piece. He said, competing with China. He said China and India aren 't beating us on labor costs. What makes it tougher, he said, we are so efficient. Our systems, our processes are so good we feel like we can compete with anybody in the world. What makes it tough for us to compete is the stuff you politicians do, and he pointed right to our Senator. He said it is the tax increases, it is the regulation, it is the litigation, it is those sorts of things in our economy, in our policy that make it tough for us to compete. We have got to recognize that when we are competing in this world market today, it is important we get it right, because, again the competition is so stiff. And then of course the other reason that has been talked about very elo-quently, I think, this evening, why it is bad policy to raise taxes. It is not just because it is bad for the economy. It is not just because we have all this focus when we are dealing with the budget where we talk about budgets and num-bers and revenues and projections. It is bad because it is about people. It is about families. And when you think about what really makes our country strong, what has allowed the United States of America to be the most pros-perous Nation in history, it is the fact that we have that key institution that has been so strong, that family institu-tion. And really, I believe what makes America so great, it is this idea, and the chairman was just alluding to this, it is this idea that moms and dads are willing to sacrifice so that their kids can have life a little better than they did. And then that next generation, as they grow up, they do the same thing for their kids and their grandkids, and it continues. And it has been that cycle that has allowed America to prosper. If we are going to take an additional $2,500 per family away from them, away from their checkbook, away from their pocketbook, away from their goals, their dreams, the things they want to spend it on, we are making it tougher for that American Dream to continue. We are making it tougher on the families, that key institution in our culture. And that is why this budg-et, this $392 billion tax increase is wrong for our country when we think about competing in the world market, and it is wrong for families who make this country so great in the first place. And with that I would yield back to the chairman of the RSC and thank him for his work here this evening and for his continued work for families across this country. Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gen- tleman from Ohio for joining us this evening, for this debate about the very important budget that will be intro-duced and debated on this floor tomor-row, Mr. Speaker. Another aspect of this debate that is important to note, and I am sure we will hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, how tax relief over the last several years has somehow been a bad thing for America. I might note, Mr. Speaker, that as we have given small businesses and Amer-ica's families tax relief, guess what we have? We have more tax revenue. And, in fact, Mr. Speaker, we have more tax revenue than we have ever had in the VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:29 Mar 28, H3176 March 27, 2007 history of America. We are awash in tax revenue. Why? Because if you let the American people keep more of what they earn, they will save, they will invest, they will work hard. They will expand the automobile trans-mission shop on one street corner. They will go out and start a barbecue stand on another street corner. It is called entrepreneurial vision. People go out and roll up their sleeves and work hard, and that is what they have done. And not only, Mr. Speaker, are we awash in tax revenue. In this case, tax relief has proven to be part of the def-icit solution. We also have new jobs. Since we have had tax relief, we have created 7 12million new jobs in Amer- ica. 712million new jobs. The greatest health care program, the greatest nu-tritional program, the greatest housing program in the history of America is the American free enterprise system and the jobs that it creates. But, Mr. Speaker, if the Democrats go through with their program to have the single largest tax increase in Amer-ican history, you start taking the jobs away. And somehow they call it com-passion when they hand you a govern-ment check and they take away your paycheck, because when they increase taxes on American families and they increase taxes on small businesses, they take away our jobs. They take away our careers. They take away our futures. There is nothing fair about that, Mr. Speaker. There is nothing compassionate about that. The Republican budget will ensure that hardworking American families are not burdened with further tax in-creases. The Republican budget will make sure that the next generation en-joys greater freedom and greater op-portunity, and that vital programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Secu-rity that are going broke, that we re-form them and modernize them and that we can save them for the next generation. The Democrat budget is absolutely silent, absolutely silent on the number one fiscal challenge to the next genera-tion. b2240 They present a budget for the next election, Mr. Speaker. We are pre-senting a budget for the next genera-tion. So I hope, Mr. Speaker, that the American people will follow this very important debate closely, because there are two different visions. One be-lieves in the family budget; one be-lieves in the Federal budget. One be-lieves in American families keeping more of what they earn; the other be-lieves in the single largest tax increase in American history. And it is not too late for us to vote for the family budg-et and against the single largest tax in-crease in American history.

Under the Speaker 's an- nounced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. R OSS) is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-ignee of the majority leader. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this evening, I rise on behalf of the 43-member- strong, fiscally conservative Demo-cratic Blue Dog Coalition. Mr. Speaker, I don 't know about you, but I believe the American people like me are sick and tired of all the par-tisan bickering that goes on at our Na-tion's capital. I can tell you that I don't care if it is the Democratic or Re- publican idea. I ask myself is it a com-monsense idea and does it make sense for the people in Arkansas ' Fourth Congressional District? Then I vote ac-cordingly. What we have witnessed on this floor this evening is a lot of talk, and I think it is time that we speak to the facts, the facts about the state of our Nation and how we get out of this mess that we have seen be created during the past 6 years when the Republicans controlled the White House, the House, and the Senate. Let's begin by looking here at the Blue Dog Coalition poster. The Blue Dog Coalition is nothing more than a name for fiscally conservative Demo-crats. And as you walk the halls of Congress, the Cannon House office building, the Longworth House office building, and the Rayburn House office building, you will occasionally happen upon one of these Blue Dog Coalition posters reminding Members of Con-gress, reminding those who walk the halls of Congress that today, today, the United States national debt is $8,841,089,074,666.40. If you divide that by every man, woman, and child living in America today, every one of us, our share is $29,326.47. It is what those of us in the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition call the debt tax, d-e-b-t, and that is one tax that cannot be cut, that will not go away until we get our Nation 's fiscal house in order. This evening, they have been talking about the budget for fiscal year 2008 that will begin October 1. Let 's begin by talking about the budget passed by the Republicans for fiscal year 2007. Mr. Speaker, I have got to tell you that when I came to Washington back in 2001, the first bill I filed as a Member of Congress was a bill to tell the politi-cians in Washington to keep their hands off the Social Security Trust Fund. That was back when the Repub-licans controlled the White House, the House, and the Senate. And the Repub-lican national leadership would not give me a hearing or a vote on that bill. Now we know why. Because this year, under the budget that was ap-proved last year by the Republicans for fiscal year 2007, the deficit, the deficit is $427 billion. That is counting the portion that they are borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund with absolutely no provision made on how it is going to be paid back, when it is going to be paid back, or where the money is coming from to pay it back. We hear a lot of talk about the na- tional debt. It doesn 't show up much in most public opinion polls. A lot of folks think we can simply print more money. Oh, how I wished it were that simple. The total national debt from 1789 until 2000 was $5.67 trillion. But, by 2010, the total national debt will have increased to $10.88 trillion. I know those are big numbers. They are big numbers to me. But I can tell you this: It is a doubling, it is a dou-bling of the 211 year debt in just one decade, in just 10 years. Interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest-growing parts of the Federal budget, and the debt tax, d-e-b- t, is the one tax that cannot be re-pealed. And every man, woman, and child in America, our share is $29,326.47. It would take all of us in America writing a check that large to pay off this debt that has been accumu-lated as a result of the reckless spend-ing we have seen from this administra-tion and this Republican-led Congress for the past 6 years. Well, as you can see, the current na- tional debt, $8,841,089,074,666.40, again, VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 H3177 March 27, 2007 every man woman and child in Amer- ica, our share of the national debt, $29,326.47. Why do I raise this issue and why is this issue so important to the 43 mem-bers of the fiscally conservative Demo-cratic Blue Dog Coalition? Here is why: Deficits do matter. Deficits reduce eco-nomic growth. They burden our chil-dren, our grandchildren with liabil-ities. They increase our reliance on for-eign lenders. In fact, I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that we look here at the amount of foreign-held debt and the fact that it has more than doubled under the Bush administration. These numbers are in the billions. You can see how much was borrowed from for-eigners in 2001, and you can see how much is borrowed from foreigners today. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders to fund our govern-ment. Foreign central banks and for-eign investors currently hold a total of about $2.224 trillion. That is, $2,224,000,000,000 of our public debt. Compare this to only $623 billion in for-eign holdings in 1993. Kind of like David Letterman and his Top Ten List, we have a Top Ten List of whom the United States of America has borrowed money from, we are talk-ing foreign central banks and foreign investors, to fund our government. Since 2001, this administration and this Republican-led Congress has continued to pass tax cuts that primarily benefit only those earning over $400,000 a year. They have done so while America is at war. Never before have we cut taxes when America was at war. In the past wars, we have had a shared sacrifice; and this war the only sacrifice being made is by our men and women, our brave men and women in uniform and their families. b2250 I know this. My brother-in-law is currently stationed in the Middle East in the United States Air Force. This war has affected all of us in one way or another, and I know the kind of toil that takes, not only on him but his family back home at Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Washington. Yet we have seen this administration, this Republican-led Congress, up until January pass tax cut after tax cut that primarily only benefits those earning over $400,000 a year. Where is the money coming from? We haven 't had a surplus. It has come, first, from raiding the Social Security trust fund. After they have gotten all the money they can suck out of it, they have gone to foreign investors and for-eign central banks. Here is the top 10 list. Japan: Our Nation has borrowed $637.4 billion from Japan to fund tax cuts for people in this country earning over $400,000 a year. China: $346.5 billion. The United Kingdom: $223.5 billion. OPEC: Now we understand why gaso- line was approaching $3 a gallon last summer. We have borrowed $97.1 billion from OPEC to fund tax cuts in America for folks earning over $400,000 a year. Korea: $67.7 billion. Taiwan: $63.2 billion. My friend John Tanner, one of the founders of the Blue Dogs, said it best when he said our country is in such a mess that if China does decide to invade Taiwan, we will have to borrow even more money from China to defend Taiwan. The Caribbean Banking Center: $63.6 billion. Hong Kong: $51 billion. The United States of America has borrowed $52.1 billion from Germany to fund our government. And get a load of this: The United States of America, our country, has borrowed $38.2 billion from Mexico to help fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over $400,000 a year. Those are the facts, not rhetoric, as we have heard. Well, the Democrats are now in the majority, and it is now our responsi-bility to offer up a commonsense budg-et that puts America 's children and families first again. Yes, we are doing it without raising taxes. In fact, we are proposing tax cuts. We are proposing a fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is now eating away at middle-in-come families all across this country. I think it is important to note that for the first time in 40 years, and this is not a partisan thing, President Clin-ton was born and grew up in Hope and Hot Springs Arkansas, two towns I am proud to represent in the United States House of Representatives. I am a 1979 graduate of Hope High School and live some 16 miles up the road from there now in Prescott, Arkansas, which is where Holly and I are raising our chil-dren. But if you think back with me, it was President Clinton who gave us the first balanced budget in this country by a Democrat or a Republican, either one, in about 40 years. You can see that the debt added under President Clinton was $1.6 trillion. We actually had a bal-anced budget from 1998 through 2001. Then the debt added under President Bush so far, $3.9 trillion. This is an ac-cumulation of gross national debt in trillions of dollars, the difference that we have seen. How did that happen? Well, in the Clinton years, when we had the first balanced budget in about 40 years, one of the ways it happened was by the House of Representatives imple-menting what is known as the PAYGO rules, which means pay-as-you-go, something that we do at the Ross home in Prescott, Arkansas, something that we do at our small-town family phar-macy that my wife, who is a phar-macist, and I own, and something most families in America and most busi-nesses in America adhere to. Pay-as- you-go. Yet for the past 6 years, those rules were abolished on the floor of the United States House of Representa-tives. The PAYGO rules were not in ef-fect, and we saw the largest deficit after the largest deficit after the larg-est deficit in the history of this coun-try, which has totaled into the largest debt ever in our Nation 's history. I am real proud of the new Demo- cratic leadership, because the 43 mem-bers of the fiscally conservative, Demo-cratic Blue Dog Coalition went to the Democratic leadership and said we are in the middle, and we believe we are where America is and it is important to us that you govern from the middle, and they have. There was a lot of talk about the first 100 hours, and we did a lot of good things for the American people in the first 100 hours. We did a lot of good things for children, we did a lot of good things for working families, and, yes, a lot of good things for seniors. We cleaned up the mess in Washington by passing ethics reform. We raised the Federal minimum wage for working families. We passed legislation to allow our government to negotiate with the big drug manufacturers to bring down the high cost of medicine for America 's seniors. We did a lot of good things in the first 100 hours. But the most significant thing we did early on, one of the first things we did in the first few hours of the 110th ses-sion of Congress, is we adopted PAYGO rules on the floor of the United States House of Representatives, meaning pay-as-you-go. It means if you have got an idea for a program you want to fund over here, you have to show us how you are going to pay for it. You have to show us what you are going to cut over here. Now, some Republicans seem to think that means that the way you pay for new programs is raising taxes. We saw the largest deficit ever in our Na-tion's history, year after year. We saw the largest debt in our Nation 's history ever. And we saw all this money that the Republican leadership and this ad-ministration was borrowing from for-eign central banks and foreign inves-tors to fund tax cuts and to fund pro-grams. They were so out of touch that they forgot the idea that you could actually cut programs to fund programs, cut programs that don 't work to fund pro- grams that do. You don 't have to raise taxes to fund programs. You do away with the pro-grams that do not work. You want to talk about waste? There is all kinds of waste in our Federal Government. I have about $400 million worth of waste sitting in a cow pasture at the airport in Hope Arkansas. In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina hit, one the first things FEMA did was order tens of thousands of brand new, fully-furnished mobile homes. They brought many of them, 10,777 at one time, to the airport in Hope, which had these inactive tarmacs and runways that were World War II era, and they thought it was a wonderful place to have a so-called FEMA staging area. The idea was they were going to come through there on the way to the VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3178 March 27, 2007 Gulf Coast. They all came, but they never went. This was 2005, and these mobile homes never got to the storm victims of Hurricane Katrina. At last count, FEMA has 8,420, 8,420 of these brand new, fully-furnished, not camper trailers, we are talking about mobile homes, 16 foot wide and 60 foot long, just sitting there. Just sitting there. To try to get them to the homeless on the Gulf Coast, I raised the issue with the Inspector General at FEMA back in late 2050, saying, Mr. Inspector General, Mr. Director of FEMA, Mr. President, if you don 't move these mo- bile homes off this cow pasture, they are going to start sinking and it is going to destroy them. I did that to try to get them off high center and get them to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. b2300 You know what they did? Mr. Speak- er, do you know what they did? They showed up. They didn 't move them. They showed up with $7 million. FEMA showed up with $7 million worth of gravel to put under them. This stuff is so crazy you can 't make it up. And they continue to sit there today. So the Republican leadership needs to understand when we talk about pay-ing for something, when we talk about cutting programs that don 't work and use that money to pay for programs that do, we are not talking about rais-ing taxes, we are talking about identi-fying waste, like the $400 million, the more than 8,000 brand new, fully fur-nished mobile homes sitting there in the cow pasture at the airport in Hope, Arkansas. That was one of the first things that happened on the floor of the House at the Blue Dog 's insistence, as this 110th began under the new Democratic ma-jority. And I am proud of this majority for listening to the 43 of us. It was one of our 12 points that I spent the last 2 years on the floor of the House talking about for meaningful budget reform. It was one of the first things imple-mented on this floor which will help us get back to the days of a balanced budget and a surplus, which is very, very important for a lot of reasons that we will discuss. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that we look at the facts. The debt when President Bush took office, $5.7 trillion, the debt today $8.8 trillion. The debt added so far under the Bush Administration, $3.1 trillion, the debt projected at the end of the Bush Presi-dency is $9.6 trillion, the total Bush in-creases to the debt, $3.9 trillion. Defi-cits without the Social Security sur-plus. The OM budget deficit for 2007, $427 billion. The OM budget deficit for 2008 under the President 's budget, $451 billion, one of the largest deficits ever in our Nation 's history. The cost of debt service. This is why it matters to every man, woman and child in America. The net interest for 2002 was $170 billion. You can see what 's happening here. The net inter-est for 2008 is projected to be $261 bil- lion. What does that mean? That means our Nation is spending three- quarters of a billion dollars a day sim-ply paying interest on the national debt before we borrow another billion dollars today. Every day, our Nation starts off owing three-quarters of a bil-lion dollars in interest payments. Let me tell you why that matters. Because the interest payments on the debt are dwarfing other priorities. The red is the amount of money we are spending of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, paying interest on the na-tional debt. We talk about our children and how we love them and how we value their education. Look at how much we are investing in education in this country. Again, the red demonstrates the amount of money we are spending in a year paying interest to the national debt, which continues to go up to the tune of about $1 billion a day. The light blue reflects how much we do, as a Na-tion, value education. It reflects how much we are spending in a year edu-cating our children. The green. Oh, we talk about how we support our men and women in uniform on the floor of this House. And I hope every Member that gets up and says that does. You know, money speaks louder than words. Look at our prior-ities. The green represents the amount of money our Federal Government is spending on veterans, including a new generation of veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. Look how that compares to the red, the amount of money we are spending simply pay-ing interest on the national debt. And this new buzz word ''homeland security. '' Oh, we all take our belt off and take our shoes off and go through all that at the airport, and we feel safer. Are we? Look at the purple. Look at how much we are investing in homeland security. Look at how much we are investing as a Nation under the President 's budget, all of this is under the President 's budget in keeping America safe, and look how all those, education, veterans, homeland security compare to the amount of money our Nation is spending paying interest on the national debt. I represent a district about half of Arkansas, and about half of that is in the Delta region, one of the poorest re-gions in the country. We have a lot of hope in that region that someday I -69 will be completed. I -69 is an interstate that was announced in Indianapolis 5 years before I was born. I am 45. With the exception of about 40 miles in Ken-tucky and a few miles in Tennessee, none of that has been completed south of Indianapolis. Just to complete the Arkansas section that can create eco-nomic opportunities and help the Delta region realize an economic revival with will take some $1.6 billion. That 's a lot of money we don 't have as a Nation. Why? Because we are spending it pay-ing interest on the national debt, a debt that continues to go up under these Republican policies and under this administration 's budget. As I said earlier, we are spending three-quarters of a billion dollars a day simply paying interest on the national debt. Give me about 2 days interest on the national debt, Mr. Speaker, and I can build I -69 through Arkansas and create all kinds of jobs and economic opportunities and help this poor Delta region recognize an economic revival. On the western side of my State, folks have been waiting since I was a small child for the completion of Inter-state 49. It, too, can create jobs and economic opportunities and open up the western side of Arkansas and com-plete the first north-south corridor through the middle of our country. I need $2 billion to complete I -49 in Ar- kansas. It 's a lot of money, but it 's about 3 or 4 days interest on the na-tional debt. We need new public schools built in this country for our children to be able to receive the very best education pos-sible. We could build about 200 brand new elementary schools every single day in America just for the interest we are spending on the national debt. My point, Mr. Speaker, is that Amer- ica's priorities, education, veterans, homeland security, roads, infrastruc-ture, are going to continue to go unmet until this Nation gets its fiscal house in order. That is what the fiscally con-servative Democratic Blue Dog Coali-tion is all about. We are about restor-ing fiscal discipline and common sense to our government. This week, the Democrats are going to offer a budget that is fiscally re-sponsible. Our budget adheres to the PAYGO budgeting rules that I talked about earlier and provides a commit-ment to the compensation of statutory PAYGO requirements. Our legislation, I should say legislation that was passed by the Republican Congress and signed by President Bush, has increased man-datory spending by $262 billion over the last 5 years. The PAYGO rule, as ap-plied to mandatory spending increases as well as tax cuts, will enforce much greater spending restraint than the Re-publicans passed over the last 5 years. And I have gone through the details of why in my presentation earlier. The Democratic budget meets the President 's levels of spending for na- tional defense, very important to me and members of the Blue Dog Coali-tion. We 've got to have a strong na- tional defense. Our brave men and women in uniform are doing whatever we ask of them; and as long as they are willing and able to do that, it is our duty and our obligation to provide them the resources that they need to do their job as safely as possible. And it is also our duty and obligation to them to ensure they receive the health care and veterans benefits that they have earned as this new generation of veterans return from Afghanistan and Iraq. And the Democratic budget in-creases homeland security funding lev-els. VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 27, 2007 The Democratic budget reaches bal- ance, a balanced budget by 2012, and provides for greater deficit reduction than the President 's budget over 5 years. Total spending in 2012 will be 18.9 percent of GDP, exactly 1 percent lower than it will be this year and lower than it has been in any year since 2001. And, yes, that 's Democrats offering that budget, a commonsense budget to restore fiscal discipline to our Nation 's government. This is a lot different than how the other side tried to explain it. Our budget provides accountability. If there is one thing our Nation needs as a government, it is to restore ac-countability to our government. De-fense auditors estimate that more than one of six dollars they have audited for Iraq is suspect, including $2.7 billion in Halliburton contracts. The Democrat budget assumes substantial savings from more efforts by the Defense De-partment, with increased congressional oversight, to root out wasteful spend-ing, building on just-passed reform leg-islation to reduce waste in Federal con-tracting. b2310 You know, the Constitution of the United States of America gives Con-gress the duty, the authority to pro-vide oversight; and for the past 6 years this Republican-led Congress has been nothing more than a rubber stamp for whatever this administration wants. That is not what the framers of our Constitution envisioned. I am not sug-gesting, Mr. Speaker, that we go on a witch hunt or start issuing a lot of sub-poenas. But what I am suggesting is that it is time for this Congress to ful-fill its constitutional duty and respon-sibility of providing oversight. And we have started doing that. No more fly-ing into Washington on Tuesday and out on Thursday. You are seeing a new Congress that is cleaning up the mess, that is coming in on Monday and stay-ing to Friday, rolling up their sleeves. And, yes, not just voting on the floor of the House, but meeting in committees and providing the oversight as required by the Constitution of the United States of America. Also under the Democratic budget, the House committees will conduct performance reviews to make sure that government programs are working, and work to eliminate, yes, the Democratic budget will work to eliminate unneces-sary and wasteful spending. Similar ef-forts saved billions of dollars under the Clinton administration which gave us the first balanced budget by a Demo-crat or a Republican in some 40 years. The Congress will save millions of dollars by investing in efforts to iden-tify and eliminate wasteful spending and improve government efficiency. Our budget addresses the permanent AMT reform. You heard the Repub-licans tonight talking about the Demo-cratic budget is going to raise our taxes. We are not raising anyone 's taxes. In fact, our budget calls for a permanent fix for the alternative min- imum tax, commonly known as AMT, to provide tax relief, yes, tax relief, for middle-class families, without increas-ing the deficit, and reaffirms support for extending middle-income tax cuts consistent with the PAYGO rules, pay- as-you-go. The Democratic budgets includes a deficit neutral reserve fund that pro-vides the framework necessary for per-manent AMT relief for America 's mid- dle-income working families. While our plan to permanently reform AMT is a revenue and deficit neutral approach, the President 's budget calls for a tem- porary 1-year fix and contributes to the already out-of-control deficits. Well, providing a permanent fix to the AMT will prevent millions, yes, millions, of hardworking Americans from facing a devastating tax increase this year. The Democratic budget, our budget, will cut taxes for America 's working families. President Bush 's failed tax policies have left us with a debt of nearly $9 trillion. In fact, Mr. Speaker, as you can see here, again I will remind you, today the U.S. national debt: $8,841,089,074,666.40. Well, in taking a revenue and deficit neutral approach to reforming the AMT, our budget is taking a measured and responsible approach to cleaning up the fiscal mess in which our Repub-lican predecessors have left us. Over the past 6 years they have done these things, and now we have asked for a chance the clean them up, and we are in the process of doing that. The Democratic budget meets the needs of veterans. Very important. Our budget meets previously unmet needs for veterans by increasing discre-tionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs from $36.5 billion to $43.1 billion. That is a $6.6 billion in-crease over fiscal year 2007. That is an 18.1 percent increase over last year, and a $3.5 billion increase, or 8.9 per-cent over the administration request for fiscal year 2008. Over the 5-year budget, the Democratic budget resolu-tion includes $32 billion more to pro-tect the health and well-being of our men and women in uniform than does the administration 's request. And, yes, we owe it to our brave men and women in uniform, a new generation of vet-erans coming home from Iraq and Af-ghanistan. And, as a Nation, we had better be there for them and provide them the health care and the resources that they need, because they are there for us doing what our Nation is asking of them. The additional funds will allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to pro-vide excellent health care, keeping up with the high rate of health care infla-tion, and the continuing increases in new veterans entering the VA system. In fiscal year 2008, Mr. Speaker, the VA will treat 5.8 million patients. Yes, America is at war, and we need to rec-ognize it and we need to properly fund the Veterans Administration to pro-vide the health care and the needs of our new veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan. Our budget addresses the Veterans Administration 's repair and mainte- nance backlog in the wake of a VA re-port that outlines 1,000 specific prob-lems at VA facilities around the coun-try. That is no way to honor our vet-erans. We have got to fix these 1,000 specific problems that have been out-lined by the Veterans Administration, not only at Walter Reed, but all across this country. Our budget increases efforts to ad- dress mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain in-juries. The Democratic budget also re-jects the Bush administration 's pro- posed enrollment fees and near dou-bling of prescription copayments for America 's veterans. Mr. Speaker, in the last half of this hour I want to visit more about this budget that may very well be on the floor of this House on Thursday. Our budget provides for a strong national defense. Our budget provides for robust defense funding levels while targeting resources on the most pressing security concerns. It increase funding for vet-erans health care and services by $5.4 billion above current services. The Democratic budget provides more homeland security funding than the ad-ministration and provides funding for the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Yes, we are going to fund the bipar-tisan 9/11 Commission recommenda-tions that should have been done sev-eral years ago. In the area of health care, our budget accommodates an increase of $50 bil-lion to expand children 's health insur- ance to cover millions of additional un-insured children. Mr. Speaker, we have 48 million people in this country with-out health insurance. This is America. We are the leader of the free world, and we have got 48 million people in this country that don 't have access to health care. And who are these? Not the people who don 't want to work. If you don 't want to work or can 't work, you qualify for Medicaid, which is a health insurance program for the poor, the disabled, and the elderly. These 48 million folks, who are they? Ten million of them are children. Chil-dren. And the rest of them are people that are trying to do the right thing and stay off welfare and they are work-ing the jobs with no benefits. We want to expand children 's health insurance to cover the millions of additional un-insured children in this country. Education. The Democratic budget provides a 2008 program level that is $3 billion over current services for edu-cation, training, and social services, which includes funding for No Child Left Behind programs, special edu-cation, and aid to help students afford college. Now, this idea of No Child Left Behind was a great concept, but it has become nothing more than an unfunded mandate for our local school districts, and it has forced our schools and teach-ers to spend all their time teaching to VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3180 March 27, 2007 a test instead of teaching our children how to learn. This No Child Left Behind business is so messed up, Mr. Speaker, that we are spending the whole school year teach-ing a test, and then giving the children the test in March on everything that they were supposed to learn through May. It is my understanding the reason they give the test in March on every-thing they are supposed to learn through May is they have got to do it early, as in March, so that the people that grade the tests can get the results back by October so the school district will have it to write a report that is due in September on how they are going to make the school better. b2320 And they call it No Child Left Be- hind. It needs some serious fine tuning, and we need to put an end to this un-funded mandate and fund this program and fund our children 's education. Well, the budget, as I mentioned, also will provide aid to help students afford college. The Democratic budget in-creases funds for Head Start and child care. Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, that we live in a country where we get to choose where we work, where we wor-ship, whom we marry. One of the few things in life we don 't get to choose is who our parents are. Some children get really lucky. I did. Some don 't. But as a Nation, I believe we have a duty and an obligation to be there for all chil-dren. And, Mr. Speaker, if we will in-vest in their education, in Head Start funding, if we will invest in the early years of a child 's life, we can turn them into a productive, lifelong citizen of this country. Compare that to turning our backs on them and spending $25,000 a year warehousing them behind bars. The choice is easy for me, and that choice is reflected in our Democratic budget. Well, the fiscally conservative Demo- cratic Blue Dog Coalition in the past has had to write our own budget. Why? Because the Republican leadership wouldn 't give us a seat at the table. They wouldn 't listen to our ideas. They would not include our ideas in their budget. This year the new Democratic majority leadership invited the Blue Dog Coalition, the 43 of us that are fis-cally conservative Democrats, to sit at the table and to help draft a common-sense budget that reflects our values, our priorities, and restores fiscal dis-cipline to our Nation 's government. We asked for several principles to be in-cluded in this budget, and I am pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the budg-et that will be on the floor of this House on Thursday includes all six of the provisions that we asked for. Again, we are in the middle, America is in the middle, and as you can see, we are ensuring that this new Democratic majority governs from the middle. Here are the six points that we asked to be included in the budget, and they have been: Number one, as we men-tioned earlier, the Democratic budget adheres to the House pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule, a principle long advo-cated by the Blue Dogs as a solution for putting an end to deficit spending and reducing the nearly $9 trillion na-tional debt. Republican budgets over the past several years included a net total of hundreds of billions of dollars in new mandatory spending. By con-trast, this budget includes a net total of zero dollars in new mandatory spending. Due to its adherence to PAYGO rules, any increases in manda-tory spending must be offset elsewhere in the government. That means cut programs that don 't work. Don 't bor- row more money from China and Mex-ico. That key provision is included in the budget that will be on the floor of this House, the Democratic budget, on Thursday. The second thing we asked for and got in this budget: The Democratic budget provides a commitment to the extension of statutory PAYGO require-ments, a tool that was instrumental, as I mentioned earlier, in the return of the budget surpluses during the 1990s. Our budget resolution puts the House on record as endorsing an extension of the statutory version of PAYGO, pay- as-you-go, rules, which proved instru-mental in bringing the budgets from large deficits of the early 1990s to the budget surpluses achieved by the end of that decade. We have now passed PAYGO as a rule in the House, and now in this budget we are endorsing it as law. Number three, we asked for and re- ceived in this budget a provision for a strong national defense. The budget provides for a strong national defense and ensures that the protection of all Americans is the number one priority of our Federal Government. The pre-amble of the Blue Dog Coalition talks about fiscal discipline and talks about a strong national defense. It was im-portant to us that we matched the funding request in the President 's budget and provide increases in home-land security funding levels, and we have done that. The Democratic budget does that. It targets these resources to our most pressing security needs, and the budget includes an increase over the President 's request for veterans health care and homeland security. That is the third point. The fourth point that we asked for and got included in the budget: Unlike the President 's budget, the Democratic budget is fiscally responsible and real-istically reaches balance in 2012. Our budget puts an end to irresponsible def-icit spending and has a better bottom line than the President 's budget over 5 years by $234 billion and therefore ac-crues less debt and waste, fewer re-sources on interest payments on the national debt. Our budget holds the line on mandatory spending levels, put-ting our country back on the path to-ward fiscal responsibility. The fifth thing we asked for and got in the budget, Mr. Speaker, provides for fiscally responsible tax relief. The budget calls for a permanent fix, not temporary, but a permanent fix, for the alternative minimum tax, AMT, to pro-vide tax relief for middle-class families without increasing the deficit and reaf-firms support for extending middle-in-come tax cuts consistent with PAYGO, pay-as-you-go, rules. And, finally, number six, the last thing we asked for and got included in the budget: The Democratic budget contains tough program integrity measures to crack down on wasteful spending while ensuring that legiti-mate recipients of Federal funds and law-biding taxpayers are not penalized. That is what our new Democratic budg-et does. It will be on the floor of this House on Thursday. Here is the alternative. This is what has been proposed by the President in his budget: The Bush administration has turned a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion into a projected 10-year deficit of $2.8 trillion. Under the last 6 years of fiscal irrespon-sibility, America 's national debt has increased 50 percent to nearly $9 tril-lion, or $29,000 for every American. About 75 percent of America 's new debt has been borrowed from foreign credi-tors, making our fiscal integrity a matter of national security. The na-tional debt is up $3 trillion since 2001, and it will soar to more than $12 tril-lion by the end of 2012. President Bush has now borrowed more money from foreign nations than the previous 42 U.S. Presidents combined. Let me re-peat that. This administration has bor-rowed more money from foreign cen-tral banks and foreign investors in the past 6 years than the previous 42 Presi-dents combined. You want to talk about a threat to our national secu-rity, there is one. Well, the President 's budget con- tinues on the same fiscally irrespon-sible course. Under the President 's budget, America 's national debt will grow by $3 trillion over the next 5 years to $11.5 trillion, more than twice the size of the debt that the Bush ad-ministration inherited. Under the President 's plan, deficits continue for the next 5 years. The deficit would in-crease by $24 billion in fiscal year 2008 if not for a growing Social Security surplus that is used to mask the true nature of the President 's deficits. With honest and realistic accounting, under the President 's budget, we have a def- icit projected to rise to $464 billion by 2016. To hide this fact, the budget omits enormous costs, including the full cost of fixing the alternative min-imum tax and the full cost for the Iraqi war, which is now costing us as tax-payers some $12 million an hour. b2330 $2.5 billion a week it costs us, $9 bil- lion a month. The President 's budget cuts domestic purchasing power by $114 billion over 5 years. Well, the President 's budget omits the full cost of the administra-tion's policy in Iraq and Afghanistan, VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:29 Mar 28, H3181 March 27, 2007 which means the President will come back, as he did last week, asking for more emergency spending, asking for more supplemental measures, another way of trying to hide the true cost of the war in Iraq. The President 's budget only provides $50 billion for wars in Iraq and Afghani-stan after fiscal year 2008, yet last week he asked for $95 billion just to get through the rest of this year. Despite the numerous underestimations pro-vided in years past and the nearly half a trillion dollars spent already, again he has come in and underestimated the amount of money that will be needed for fiscal year 2008 in Iraq and Afghani-stan. The administration 's budget discon- tinues the funding after just a down payment for 2009, even though the ad-ministration is increasing troop strengths and has no current plans to scale back operations in Iraq or Af-ghanistan. Mr. Speaker, a recent CBO, Congres- sional Budget Office, scenario esti-mated war costs for Iraq, Afghanistan and the Global War on Terrorism, could be as much as $603 billion higher over 10 years than what is included in the administration 's budget. The Presi- dent's budget uses rosy assumptions that boost the bottom line. The Presi-dent's 2008 budget relies on unrealisti- cally rosy assumptions that the econ-omy will grow its way back to a budget surplus. For example, in 2012 it assumes reve- nues that are $155 billion higher than comparable projections made by CBO, the Congressional Budget Office. With-out these optimistic assumptions, a claimed 2012 surplus of $61 billion be-comes a $94 billion deficit. The President 's budget fails to ad- dress permanent AMT reform. The President 's budget includes only a 1 year fix for the Alternative Minimum Tax. This will allow the number of tax-payers affected by the AMT to sky-rocket from 3.5 million in 2006 to 26.5 million in 2008, and represents a $247 billion tax increase on middle class families over the next 5 years. That is in the budget President 's budget, a $247 billion tax increase on middle-class families over the next 5 years. Forty-three members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog coa-lition do not support tax increases like the one found here in the President 's budget. The AMT has been deliberately used by the Bush administration to mask, to hide, the cost of its tax cuts, which have been paid for by the mid-dle-class. The AMT has also taken back a large portion of the Bush tax cuts promised for middle-class families. In 2001, an act provided marriage penalty relief by increasing the standard deduction and the size of the 15 percent tax bracket, but it did not reduce the marriage pen-alty contained in the AMT. In essence the 2001 act did not provide marriage penalty relief for many married tax-payers. Democrats are going to fix that in the budget voted on on the floor of this House on Thursday. It remains unfixed, however, in the President 's budget. Congress has recently enacted a se- ries of temporary fixes that limited the expansion of the AMT, Alternative Minimum Tax, to about 4 million tax-payers. But if left unchanged, next year the AMT will become a burden on the pocketbooks of millions of middle- class Americans. Well, the President 's budget also in- cludes additional hidden taxes and fee increases. For example, the President 's budget raises taxes on about 30 million families with employer-provided health insurance by over $300 billion over 10 years. The President 's plan will result in a growing proportion of seniors pay-ing higher Medicare premiums every year by eliminating indexing of the in-come related premium and extending it to the Medicare prescription drug ben-efit. These proposals will increase pre-miums paid by seniors to the tune of $5.5 billion over the next 5 years. Veterans, I told you what the Demo- cratic budget is going to do for vet-erans. Let 's look at the President 's. The President 's budget proposes new enrollment fees and increases copay-ments for veterans healthcare. These fee collections will cost veterans $2.3 billion from 2008 to 2012. The President 's budget also imposes medical fees on TRICARE, the health insurance plan for military retirees under the age of 65. The increased fees imposed on military retirees will amount to $1.9 billion in 2008 and $14.5 billion over 5 years. The President 's budget eliminates, doesn 't cut, it eliminates, a $9 million traumatic brain injury program at a time when hundreds of Iraq and Af-ghanistan veterans are returning home needing help as a result of these trau-matic brain injuries. Education. We talked about what the Democratic budget will do for edu-cation. Let 's look at the President 's. The President 's budget cuts funding for elementary and secondary education, denying 3.2 million children the extra reading and math help they were prom-ised by the so-called No Child Left Be-hind Act. The Bush budget eliminates higher education programs designed to help lower income students afford college, including the Perkins loans, the Sup-plemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program and the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program. Approximately 1.5 million students would lose financial aid awards as a result of these Bush higher education cuts. Mr. Speaker, the Bush budget elimi- nates, not cuts, it does not cut, it eliminates 44 education programs, in-cluding Supplemental Opportunity Education Grants, Education Tech-nology, Even Start, Ready to Teach, school counseling, mentoring and school drop out prevention. The President 's budget cuts, I am sorry, it doesn 't cut, it eliminates, 44 education programs that can help to lift up our young people. The Presi-dent's budget cuts discretionary edu- cation funding by $1.5 billion, or 2.6 percent below fiscal year 2007. Well, the President 's budget also re- duces the availability of low cost loans for financially needy students by pro-posing to recall $419 million from Per-kins loan revolving funds held by 1,315 colleges and universities. This will be the first step toward recalling $3.2 bil-lion over 5 years from these revolving funds, which are used to provide low in-come loans averaging $2,000 to finan-cially needy students. The President 's budget eliminates the $771 million Supplemental Edu-cational Opportunity Grant Program and the $65 million Leveraging Edu-cational Assistance Partnership Pro-gram, both of which help lower income students afford a higher education. Overall, Mr. Speaker, approximately 1.5 million students would lose finan-cial aid awards as a result of these Bush higher education cuts. The Bush budget cuts funding for Head Start by $100 million. If enacted, this cut in the President 's budget means that up to 13,500 children will be cut from the program next year. There are cuts to healthcare. There are so many cuts. There are cuts to ag-riculture. There are cuts to homeland security. Mr. Speaker, I know as our time winds down that it is important that we look at the President 's budget, it is important that we look at the Demo-cratic budget and that we ask ourself, which one reflects our values, our pri-orities? Which one reflects America 's values and priorities? I am proud that this new Democratic majority on the Budget Committee, under the leadership of Chairman S PRATT , that they sat with us, 43 mem- ber strong fiscally conservative Demo-cratic Blue Dog Coalition and gave us input in helping write a common sense budget that meets America 's values and priorities, while restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our Na-tion's government. b2340 And I hope on Thursday, Mr. Speak- er, we will see this budget, this com-monsense budget pass that does reflect our values. It relates to our children and education, to our working families, to our seniors and their security, their Social Security and their retirement security and their health care security, and to children, some 10 million with-out health insurance tonight. It is a commonsense budget that can help us return to the days of a balanced budget, that can help us put an end to this deficit spending, that can help us put an end to this reckless spending that we have seen for the past 6 years occur day after day on the floor of this House Chamber. Mr. Speaker, as I close this evening, I remind you that as you walk the halls of Congress, as you walk the VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:59 Mar 28, H3182 March 27, 2007 House Office Buildings, you will note this Blue Dog Coalition poster remind-ing every Member of Congress and those who walk the halls that today the U.S. national debt is $8,841,089,074,666.40. And every one of us, every man, woman and child in America, our share is $29,326.47. Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that it is our duty and obligation to restore fiscal discipline to our national govern-ment; and that when we leave here someday we will be able to say to our children and grandchildren that we helped make this country a better place for all of us to call home. With that, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 43 member strong, fiscally conserv-ative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, I yield back the balance of my time. f LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of ab- sence was granted to: Mr. A NDREWS (at the request of Mr. HOYER ) for today. f SPECIAL ORDERS GRANTED By unanimous consent, permission to address the House, following the legis-lative program and any special orders heretofore entered, was granted to: The following Members (at the re- quest of Mr. R ODRIGUEZ ) to revise and extend their remarks and include ex-traneous material: Mr. R ODRIGUEZ , for 5 minutes, today.

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of- fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Most holy and gracious God, who turns the shadow of night into the glory of morning, shower our law-makers with Your mercy this day. Calm troubled thoughts, and guide their feet in the way of peace. Let Your strength be more than suf- ficient to meet and manage their weak-nesses. Make them instruments of Your grace and goodness, as You renew in them the joy of belonging to You. Let Your eyes rest upon our Senators, and keep Your ears open to their pray-ers. Guard their feet so that they will not deviate from the path of unwavering integrity. Give them fresh opportuni-ties to discover Your unlimited power. We pray in Your blessed Name. Amen. f PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Honorable R OBERT MENENDEZ led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please read a communication to the Senate from the President pro tempore (Mr. B YRD). The assistant legislative clerk read the following letter: U.S. S ENATE , PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE , Washington, DC, March 27, 2007. To the Senate: Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable R OBERT MENENDEZ , a Senator from the State of New Jersey, to perform the duties of the Chair. R OBERT C. B YRD, President pro tempore. Mr. MENENDEZ thereupon assumed the chair as Acting President pro tem-pore. f RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The majority leader is recog-nized. f SCHEDULE Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to proceed to a period of morning business now. It will be for 60 minutes. The time is divided between both the majority and the minority. The Repub-licans are controlling the first 30 min-utes. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 1591, which is the supplemental appropriations bill. We will interrupt consideration of the supplemental at 11:50 in order to debate a judicial nomi-nation. A vote on confirmation of the nomination of George Wu to be a U.S. district judge will occur around 12:10 or thereabouts. The vote will be the first vote today. After that vote, we will re-cess until 2:15 p.m. in order to permit the regular Tuesday meeting of the re-spective party conferences. As a reminder, cloture was filed last evening on the supplemental appropria-tions bill. Members have until 2:30 today to file first-degree amendments. We are conferring with the Repub- licans\u2014Senator M CCONNELL and I have spoken on a number of occasions, not this morning yet but yesterday\u2014to try to arrange votes on a number of amendments, one of which is the one filed by Senator C OCHRAN . We are going to try to work out an orderly process to go to an amendment relating to minimum wage. There are, perhaps, some other amendments the Repub- licans want to do dealing with strikes, dealing with the funding of this bill. There is an issue which is important to both Democrats and Republicans deal-ing with county payments and pay-ment in lieu of taxes. At this stage, that is the universe of the matters we will work on and try to get time agreements to proceed to the cloture vote, which will occur in the morning. Hopefully, we can work to-ward that end and get a lot of it done today. We all recognize the importance of this legislation, not only from the as-pect of the military, but there are other matters in the bill that are ex-tremely important. f RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The minority leader is recog-nized. f VOTES Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just note the remarks of the major-ity leader that there are at least three amendments, hopefully, we can vote on today: the pending Cochran amend-ment; there will be a minimum wage amendment, on which Senator G RASS - LEYand Senator B AUCUS are working; and the so-called county payments amendment, which also has bipartisan support, which was referred to by Sen-ator R EID. It would be my hope that we could vote on all of those today. We have, as the majority leader indicated, the cloture motion vote in the morn-ing, so I think it would be good to dis-pose of those three for sure today, if not others. Mr. President, I yield the floor. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3782 March 27, 2007 RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. f MORNING BUSINESS The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Under the previous order, there will now be a period for the transaction of morning business for up to 60 min-utes, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, with the first 30 minutes under the control of the Republicans and the final 30 minutes under the control of the ma-jority. f IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think this is certainly one of the most impor-tant bills we have had before us and one, frankly, that is the most time- constrained of any we have had before us. Normally, we have a good deal of time to talk about bills and we have budget bills that won 't go into effect until next year, but the fact is, this bill, which is for the funding of troops, these dollars need to be available with-in the next couple of weeks, as we un-derstand it, of course. So it is impor-tant that we recognize that and that we understand the purpose of this bill is to fund our troops. Whether you agree with the troops being there, the troops are there, and the fact is that it is up to us to provide the support they need and the dollars which are necessary to provide them the support they need in the position they are in. If there were ever a bill that should be recognized as having a unique purpose and should not be at-tached to other kinds of nonpertinent issues, I believe this is one. We are going to have the opportunity to decide whether we want to attach other issues to this bill and extend it, whether we want to have a situation where there is a veto and all those time-consuming things or whether we indeed want to have a clean bill that provides for the support of our troops who are now in Iraq and Afghanistan. For weeks now, the President has re- peatedly said he will veto the bill if it ties the hands of the generals on the ground. What he is saying is he and the generals have a plan, and the fact is the plan seems to be making more ad-vances and accomplishments than we have had in the past, so we need to allow that to continue to work. We have all said the President needs a dif-ferent plan. The President now has a different plan. There is new leadership in Iraq. So I think we need to understand where we are with respect to this bill because we certainly have been on no-tice and are well aware of the looming veto. That veto would simply take more time and keep this money from getting where it needs to be to support the troops. Not passing this legislation, of course, would only delay the critical resources and the necessary equipment and training for our soldiers who are getting ready to deploy or have, in fact, deployed. Secretary of Defense Gates has warned the Congress that if we delay emergency spending for our troops already deployed, many will not be able to come home. This is a very serious statement, and we need to pay attention to it. I don 't want to portray the Presi- dent's plan in Iraq as being a success so far, but our commanders on the ground are reporting good news and that we are making progress, and that is what it is all about, of course. We need to be there until we have completed our task. I understand that explaining what the completion of the task is may not be easy, and people have different views about what that should be, but it is pretty clear we need to be able to get the Iraqis in a position to govern them-selves before we can return. I am for returning as soon as possible, but I think setting an artificial definition for when they return is not appropriate anywhere and particularly not appro-priate on this bill. I just do not understand how Mem- bers on the other side can say one thing in their States and then stand and do the opposite thing \u2014stand for supporting their troops in their States and then come here and have exactly the opposite position in Washington. At this point, we are where we are, and we need to have funding for our troops in the field, no question. Nobody would argue that, and I think no one would dispute that is a time sensitive issue as well. We are going to be here this week on this bill. We are going to be gone next week. If the bill were to be vetoed, then we would have to go through that whole process. One can see that if we are going to get this done by the date which we have all heard, which is April 15, it is important we take off these kinds of things that are holding it up. We should not play political one- upmanship when it comes to funding our men and women who are in theater or are ready to deploy \u2014I don 't think there is any question about that \u2014nor should we attempt to move legislation by buying votes for things that would be at the expense of our troops. Unfortunately, the emergency legis- lation we have before us has been larded up with all manner of non-emergency spending and extraneous measures. Not only are we attempting to tie the President 's hands by micro- managing the war, but we are trying to push through pet projects at the ex-pense of our troops. I understand the politics of this place. When someone has something they would like very much to have done, the greatest thing to do is to put it on the bill that has to pass, and even though it is inappro-priate, even though it is not a part of the purpose of the bill, of course, I un-derstand that helps get it done. But the request submitted to the Congress was to have $100 billion for troops and hur-ricane relief. The bill we are consid-ering contains an additional $20 bil-lion\u2014$20 billion \u2014for individual Mem- ber requests, a minimum wage in-crease, and small tax packages. The last time I checked, none of these is an emergency, so they do not qualify for this bill. I understand the merits of many of these things, and they should be considered. But, again, in terms of how we do things here, this is an emer-gency bill, and things that are in here ought to qualify as emergencies or else not be on the bill. So we have to say: Do they have merit? Of course they have merit. There is no question that many of them do and should be individually ad-dressed in the normal legislative proc-ess. They should be considered because they have merit and, indeed, are worth consideration. However, we are also faced with the question that the major-ity has said we must get our fiscal house in order. That is what we have been hearing, but that is not what we have been doing. It is easy to say that, but it is hard to do it. We do need to take a look at spend- ing. This is an emergency bill \u2014this is outside the budget \u2014and so it is a won- derful place to pen on a lot of things that are additional spending that real-ly aren 't within the limits of spending, which all of us seem to be so proud to be putting on in this Congress. So I think we have to take a look at all those things. Almost to a person, ev-eryone has come to the floor and prom-ised the American public that future spending would be paid for. These things that are added are not paid for. So we are not keeping that promise that has been made. I think this week the majority will have an opportunity to stand by their words. We must keep Federal spending under control and accountable. To add things that are inappropriate, that do not fit on the bill, that are outside the budget \u2014to use this opportunity is not being accountable. To add projects to emergency spending, which by defini-tion is outside the normal budget proc-ess, is not the right way to accomplish this goal. It is going to be tough. We are going to have projects that everyone on both sides of the aisle thinks: Oh, that is good for my State \u2014whether it is shrimp or spinach or whatever. So there will be support for those things. But the fact is, they do not belong on this emergency bill. I remind my colleagues of the budget resolution for 2007 which explicitly de-fines what constitutes an emergency. It says all of the five following criteria must be satisfied in order for some-thing to be considered an emergency: No. 1, is necessary, essential, or vital; No. 2, sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; No. 3, a pressing and compelling urgent need requiring immediate action; No. 4, an unforeseeable, unpredictable, and VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, March 27, 2007 unanticipated issue; and, finally, not permanent but temporary in nature. The Senate has to establish the cri- teria, and I think we ought to follow it in this budget area. I know we cannot fix the problems in just 1 week. There should be an effort to remove all the extraneous and nondefense spending. I look forward to bringing an important question before us, privatizing these things. The American people will soon learn whether the Members of the Sen-ate have committed themselves to get-ting their financial house in order, whether they will back their words with action. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from Wyo-ming in addressing the pending busi-ness of the Senate, which is the emer-gency supplemental to help fund our troops who are serving in harm 's way. The problem with this particular legis-lation is it does more than that. In fact, contrary to its advertised purpose of supporting the troops, it undermines the ability of our commanders on the ground to actually succeed in the goal they volunteered to achieve and which we have asked them to do because it sets artificial timelines and attempts to micromanage the fighting of the war on the ground. It ultimately jeopardizes the ability to get funds for the troops, to provide the necessary equipment, to provide the replenishment of used-up resources that are necessary as we rotate troops who are in the battlefield today. It would ultimately make it more likely that troops who are already there \u2014who sacrificed a lot, along with their fami-lies\u2014are going to have to sacrifice even more because the troops nec-essary and the equipment necessary to actually rotate in and relieve them of their responsibilities will not be avail-able. The other thing that is so unseemly, to me, about this whole process is, be-cause this is the train leaving the sta-tion and colleagues know that this bill needs to pass, or at least some version of it \u2014emergency spending to support our troops \u2014that the House, in par- ticular, and now the Senate has joined in a similar manner in larding this ap-propriations bill with various pork projects. My colleague from Wyoming has pointed out that the nature of emer-gency spending means this money goes straight to the deficit. In other words, the bill is passed on to the next genera-tion and beyond and not paid for. We just went through an elaborate process in passing a budget resolution. Time and time again, the new majority has said they want to engage in some budget and fiscal discipline, but that stated goal, to try to deal with tax-payer dollars responsibly, to find off- sets for spending and have pay-as-you- go rules is completely belied by the ac-tions reflected in this particular appro-priations bill. The fact is, we did debate this issue just 2 weeks ago with regard to artifi-cial timelines and micromanaging the war. The Senate voted 48 to 50 not to approve cloture on S.J. Res. 9, which was an effort by our Democratic col-leagues to micromanage and set artifi-cial timelines. They lost that vote by 48 to 50. Now they are back again, try-ing it another time. Giving the enemy a timetable when American troops will withdraw from Iraq without regard to conditions on the ground, without regard to the early signs of progress that we are making, only helps the enemy plan on how to establish and accomplish their goals, not our goals. Our focus should be on how to succeed in Iraq, not how to tie the hands of our troops, jeopardize the funding that is necessary for their suc-cess, and to micromanage something that we have no business microman-aging from the Halls of Congress, thou-sands of miles away from the battle-field. The tragedy of this is it now rep- resents 18 different proposals by the Democrats in Congress on how to lose in Iraq and not a single proposal on how to succeed. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee on which I serve has pointed out that there are between 5,000 and 6,000 al- Qaida operatives now in Iraq. To pass legislation which sets an arbitrary deadline for withdrawing our combat forces without defeating al-Qaida makes no sense, no sense at all. It will create a power vacuum, much as Af-ghanistan was after the fall of the So-viet Union, which then gave rise to a failed state and a launching pad for terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. We need to do everything in our power to prevent that from happening again and not for-get the lessons of 9/11 and allow it to be repeated in Iraq. The Iraqis know our commitment there is not open ended, and they un-derstand the future of Iraq is in their hands. But to pass legislation that micromanages how our troops should fight the enemy and essentially allow the creation of safe havens for terror-ists is the height of irresponsibility. We pointed out before, but it is worth pointing out again, we unanimously confirmed General Petraeus, the archi-tect of the counterinsurgency plan cur-rently being carried out in Baghdad. He does not need the armchair generals in the Senate dictating military tactics to him. If the Members of this body really support the troops, we will pro-vide, unencumbered, the resources nec-essary for our troops to accomplish the goals which they so valiantly and bravely volunteered to do, under the leadership of great generals such as GEN David Petraeus. We all want our troops home as soon as possible. We all share that goal. But any decision to withdraw from Iraq be-fore the Iraqis themselves are able to stabilize their country, with our help, to allow them to govern and defend themselves, will not heighten Amer- ica's national security but, rather, will jeopardize it. We have had 18 proposals to date from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Every attempt they have had to try to pass one of these pro-posals has failed. But as Yogi Berra said, ''It's deja vu all over again. '' Here we go again. We just voted last week 48 to 50 against legislation that would im-pose a deadline. I hope we will not have to continue to debate this over and over again and continue to send the message to our enemies: Yes, you are that much closer to breaking Amer-ica's will in this contest of wills in something that is so important to our national security. We need to get this legislation passed and passed soon, so our troops do not have to guess wheth-er the funding necessary to carry out their mission will be forthcoming. Using the supplemental appropria- tions to play political games and to pay off domestic priorities, such as peanut subsidies and spinach subsidies, is not in the best interests of our men and women in uniform. That is why the President has threatened to veto this bill, due to the pork and the timelines that are included in it. I encourage my colleagues to think long and hard be-fore moving forward in a way that would compromise the mission of our troops who are serving to protect all of us. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the amendment of Senator C OCHRAN , the amendment to strike the language, of which I am a cosponsor. I raised this in the Appro-priations Subcommittee on Defense last week. Senator C OCHRAN indicated then that he would do as he has done; that is, to move to strike the language in the supplemental requiring the phased withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 120 days, 4 months \u2014120 days. Mr. President, as you heard \u2014and you have been a party to \u20144 months is clearly not enough time for General Petraeus or the brave members of our Armed Forces to have a chance to see if a surge in troop numbers could turn the war. I don 't know for sure. I had, as a lot of us did, a conversation with General Petraeus before he took com-mand about the troop surge, about the 20,000 troops. I personally think we need 100,000 troops, but we don 't have them. General Petraeus is a very smart man. He is a combat soldier. He is in control. I believe to put on an arbi-trary timeline of 120 days is the wrong message at the wrong time, where they are beginning \u2014just beginning \u2014to se- cure some neighborhoods. Will they continue to do this? We hope so. But we should bring every bit of stability we can to the Baghdad area. I have no illusion about sooner or later coming home. I would like to see our troops come home. I don 't think that will be the end of the struggle VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3784 March 27, 2007 with Islamic fundamentalists by any stretch of the imagination, but I think if we are able to stabilize that area of Iraq to some degree, perhaps there can be some kind of diplomatic resolution because ultimately none of us ever en-visioned staying in Iraq. We have been there 4 years. I wish we were not there today, but we are and we are heavily engaged. I think we need to give our Armed Forces every opportunity to succeed. We should not send an ambiguous mes-sage to them: We are going to support you today and tomorrow we want you to withdraw, in 120 days, or begin to withdraw. I think that is the wrong message, and I think it would under-mine the morale of our troops. Congress should not be armchair gen- erals. We should not try to micro-manage what is going on on the ground. That is why I support the Cochran amendment. We need to give our commanders and our soldiers every chance to succeed in Iraq, to bring sta-bility there, where diplomatic maneu-vers then perhaps could begin to work. Sending ambiguous messages to our Armed Forces is not the right way. They need our support both morally and materially. I believe at the end of the day they are going to get it. The President has already signaled if this language were to stay he would veto this bill. I believe what he says he is going to do. But we can strike this language today. We can move on and get this supplemental passed to make sure our troops are well funded and that they have what they need to suc-ceed. And they will succeed. The members of our Armed Forces are in harm 's way every day. We know the horror stories about war. But they bravely face a sometimes unknown enemy and have done everything asked of them \u2014sometimes two and three times, Mr. President, as you well know. Micromanaging the war from the Halls of Congress is not the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to support the Cochran amendment and strike this language from the supplemental bill. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. I know it is not our side 's time. If there is no objection, I would appreciate using the time. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is going to be a very busy day. I have comments that will relate to what will happen when we bring the bill up on the floor, but I thought I would take this time to talk about two things that are extremely important. First, with respect to the bill, I am the lead Re-publican cosponsor, with the Senators from North Dakota and South Dakota, on ag disaster. We have been 3 years without an agricultural disaster bill. We have had 3 years of agricultural dis-asters. Those of us from the Midwest know that we have been afflicted with droughts, tornadoes, tremendous losses by farmers, livestock producers, and others in agricultural production. I vis-ited southwest Missouri this January and saw what some people described as countywide tornadoes. The ice storms were so severe they broke down trees, collapsed sheds, knocked out power, broke down fences, and put many live-stock and poultry producers on the verge of financial disaster. Similarly over the years, when drought has struck, the ag producers, livestock and poultry and crops, were hit severely. This ag disaster package is absolutely essential. I appreciate the lead of the chairman of the Appropria-tions Committee in including our re-quest for ag disaster. In addition, I am a very strong sup- porter of the amendment of the rank-ing minority member of the Appropria-tions Committee to strike the limita-tions on the ability of General Petraeus to conduct the war in Iraq. Let us remember that General Petraeus came before the committees to outline his new ideas, his new plan for moving forward in Iraq. People had been saying: We need a new plan. Yes, clearly, we need a new plan. The Bremer plan, debaathification, firing the Army, sending them home without pay and with their weapons, turns out to have been the absolute wrong thing to do. But General Petraeus, who was unanimously confirmed by this body, has gone back to Iraq with his new way of going forward. They have made some significant changes in the rules of engagement. Now no longer are Shia death squads or militia off-limits. Moqtada al-Sadr has seen the light or felt the heat, and he has gone to Tehran. We are talking ac-tion against Jaysh al-Mahdi and others who are engaged in sectarian battles. We have a new plan of going in, hold-ing, and clearing, the conventional and now-proven theory of dealing with insurgencies. You cannot just go in and wipe out people who are causing chaos and killing their political enemies. You have to stay there and maintain peace, security. That is what we are sup-porting the Iraqi forces doing. The Iraqi forces are there. They are the ones who are going to have to take over. The training of the Iraqi forces is the critical element for us to assure stability in the region. Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and on mine embraced the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. For example, the distinguished majority whip on December 8 on CNN said: We ought to follow the Iraqi Study Group. This new plan the President and Gen- eral Petraeus have put forward is, by and large, the Iraq Study Group 's plan. After receiving the report, when you look at the recommendations, they track with what we are doing now, from sending reinforcements to Bagh-dad to increasing the number of embed-ded American advisers, to holding the Iraqi Government responsible for spe-cific security and political milestones. The differences between what we are doing now in Iraq and the Iraq Study Group recommendations are insignifi-cant. Sending reinforcements to Bagh-dad, the principal tenet of the new plan General Petraeus has put forth, is ref-erenced in general by the Iraq Study Group, which said it could support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad, recognizing the level of vio-lence in and around Baghdad has crip-pled the ability of both the al-Maliki Government and the U.S. military to restore basic services and establish a modicum of law and order. I quote: The ISG recognized, as does the U.S. mili- tary, that Baghdad is central to success or failure in Iraq. It is not surprising that more troops were added \u2014the total number of which is still below 2005 levels. There is one other very important point that is of concern to everybody in this body and all Americans. The Iraq Study Group said: The United States should not make an open-ended commitment to keep large num-bers of American troops deployed in Iraq. President Bush said of his plan and its implementation: I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq 's other leaders that America 's com- mitment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi gov-ernment does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people. It is clear we have a new way for- ward. The language in the underlying legislation before us says we ought to set a timetable, a political timetable. We ought to determine in this body ex-actly the dates when we start removing troops from Baghdad, from Iraq, chang-ing our policy. I have a novel idea: Wars cannot be run from these hallowed and com-fortable and sanctified chambers 10,000 miles away from the war zone. How about allowing the officers, the men, and the commanders in the field \u2014who are engaged daily, risking their lives to bring peace and security to Iraq \u2014to de- termine when and how we can best turn over to the Iraqi security forces the critical job \u2014the critical job \u2014of assur- ing security and a relatively peaceful country? Nobody is saying it is going to be a Jeffersonian democracy. What we are seeking is peace and security. We had an open hearing with the leaders of the intelligence community in January before the Senate Intel-ligence Committee. The top leaders of that intelligence community said, unanimously, it would be very unwise to establish a short-term political timetable for withdrawal prior to the VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3785 March 27, 2007 time the Iraqi security forces take over. If this body, in its ''wisdom ''\u2014an oxymoron in this case \u2014says pull out on such-and-such date, and the Iraqi security forces are not ready to take over, what would happen? Three things \u2014all of them bad. No. 1, the killing, sectarian violence between Shia and Sunnis would esca-late. You would see many more thou-sands killed, as we would no longer be there to serve as a buffer and as adviser to prevent that from happening. No. 2, the goal of al-Qaida, as ex- pressed by Osama bin Laden and his No. 2 man, Ayman al-Zawahiri, to achieve the headquarters of the caliph-ate in the ''land of the two rivers, '' i.e., Baghdad, would be achieved. They would have a safe haven. They would have a safe haven from which they could train, recruit, perhaps even get back to turning on the dual-use facili-ties Saddam Hussein set up for turning out chemical or biological weapons. Now, the third thing that would hap- pen, which is a true disaster, would be the neighboring countries would have to come in to back up their co-religion-ists. If the Sunnis are being oppressed by the Shia, then the Sunni states will be ready, and they will come in. If they come in, Iran and its Shia partners are all ready to come in. What happens then? We have a con- flagration in the Middle East bringing in many countries in a region-wide war that will draw, unfortunately, perhaps hundreds of thousands of American troops to prevent the disaster from spreading, to support our friends in Israel. General Petraeus has promised, in his confirmation hearings, that he will tell us if the new plan, the new rules of engagement \u2014putting the Iraqi security forces out front, with American advis-ers continuing to supply American troops to go after the high-value tar-gets, the radical Salafist jihadists of al-Qaida and other entities \u2014we will continue to hunt them down so they do not overwhelm the Iraqi security forces. General Petraeus will tell us. He should know by this summer if it fails. If it fails, he said he will tell us, and I would trust he would begin making such changes as are necessary, without tipping off the enemy what they are planning to do. The important thing is not telling the enemy what our time-table is. I think it is perhaps illustrative to share with you some comments from an e-mail I received from a marine who has been in Iraq and who is going back. He was commenting on a timetable. He said: I haven 't polled all of them. I don't speak for all of them, but I can tell you, a lion 's share think a time- table is a disastrous idea. I don 't know what possible benefit you can assess that would come from a timetable. Where is the help toward mission ac-complishment? He said: Iraqis understand that progress is being made. I think the Iraqi forces are getting ready to take over and with our help should be able to do it sometime in 2007. But if we tell everyone exactly when that is going to be, it gets a lot easier for the merry mujahedin to claim victory, lay low, and then wreak havoc when the coali-tion packs up shop. This particular marine said: I 'm not wild about going back to Iraq, but I would sure as heck rather do that than essentially invalidate everything we 've done to date by leaving too early and inviting chaos. That is the choice. Does a political timetable give Members cover back here? Maybe. But I have even heard that ridiculed. I have heard that ridi-culed. I ask this body to strike the lan-guage, let General Petraeus run the war, let him pursue every avenue to as-sure Iraq is stable and secure. He and the President have said, if it does not work, we will change policy. But let 's give it a chance to work. Mr. President, I appreciate the indul- gence of my colleagues and yield the floor. f CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Morning business is closed. f U.S. TROOP READINESS, VET- ERANS ' HEALTH, AND IRAQ AC- COUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 1591, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 1591) making emergency sup- plemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other pur-poses. Pending: Cochran amendment No. 643 (to amend- ment No. 641), to strike language that would tie the hands of the Commander-in-Chief by imposing an arbitrary timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, thereby undermining the position of American Armed Forces and jeopardizing the success-ful conclusion of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, before my colleague from Missouri, Senator B OND, leaves the floor, I wonder if I might just engage him in a colloquy for just a moment. Mr. BOND. Sure. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak about agriculture disaster provisions in the emergency supplemental bill. We had some people on the Senate floor yesterday ques-tioning whether they are valid, wheth-er they are necessary provisions to help family farmers. I noted the Sen-ator from Missouri was a cosponsor of mine, as we worked together to put the agriculture disaster program in the emergency supplemental bill. Let me make a point and then ask a question of my colleague from Mis-souri. First of all, I appreciate very much his help. I know Missouri has been hit with a devastating drought and other weather-related disasters for family farmers. It has been the case in other parts of the country as well. We have been working for some long while just to reach out a helping hand to those farmers out there struggling who got hit with weather-related disasters to say: You are not alone. As is the tradi- tion in this country when you get hit with a weather-related disaster and lose everything, this country wants to help you some. We help everyone around the world. It is time to take care of things at home. That is what this provision is about. I ask the Senator from Missouri about his motivation for being a part of those of us who worked together to get this put in the emergency supple-mental bill. I know he strongly sup-ports it. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the Dakotas. Before he arrived on the floor, I made the case for it. The Senator asked about the sit-uation in Missouri. I told them about the devastating ice storms. We have had a historic drought. What we need is a comprehensive national policy to deal with the problems and not just for the Dakotas or Missouri but for Colo-rado, Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, Cali-fornia \u2014throughout this country \u2014 where people have been devastated by extreme weather conditions. We have livestock producers who were hit the hardest. There is no safety net in place for livestock producers. They are not protected by crop insur-ance, the farm bill, or disaster protec-tion under the USDA since the stand-ard is crop loss and there were no crops to be lost in the middle of the winter in an ice storm. But the devastation is there. This body and this Government came to the rescue of people who were abso-lutely wiped out by Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters. Well, the impact in the farm area is very severe. No, it is not the same as a hurricane, but the weather disasters have caused tremendous hardships and threaten to put many farmers under and destroy rural communities. That is why I am very pleased to join with my colleague in urging this body to keep the agricultural disaster pro-gram, the relief we have not had for 3 years, in this bill. I thank my colleague. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for his lead-ership on this issue as well. Let me say that the Congress did help farmers in the gulf region who lost their crops. I understand we helped cit-ies that were devastated and lost build-ings and lives and so on. We also helped farmers who lost their crops. My point is \u2014and I think the point of the Senator from Missouri is \u2014there is VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May S3786 March 27, 2007 no difference between a person who loses their entire crop in Missouri or North Dakota or in the gulf region be-cause of a hurricane. We do not name droughts. We name hurricanes. But if Hurricane Katrina took your entire crop away, this Government would say: We want to help you. So, too, should we help in the case of a drought or ice storms, as the Senator from Missouri just described. I certainly appreciate his help on these matters. I wanted to come to the floor because yesterday there was some discussion by several Members of the Senate refer-ring to the agriculture disaster piece as pork. Now, our farmers know about pork, and they know you do not legis-late pork, you eat pork. There is a big difference. I am just curious, why is it every time you try to do something in this country to help people who need help, it is called pork. Well, if you invest, for example, in public policy, as we have, to say build a road in Iraq, that is na-tional security. If you have a provision in an appropriations bill that says build a road in this country, it is pork. If you build a health clinic in Iraq, that is national security. If you build it here, it is pork. If you build a water project in Iraq, that is national secu-rity. If you build it here, it is pork. Why is it, to someone in this Cham- ber, investing in this country is always pork, but as long as it is investing somewhere else in this world, that is just fine. Mr. President, $18.1 billion went out of this Chamber in unbeliev-able ways for reconstruction in Iraq. Let me tell you, any time someone is sending one-hundred-dollar bills out of the back of a pickup truck, you don 't think there is going to be graft and fraud and corruption? You take a look at what has happened with respect to the taxpayers ' money and the way it was spent in Iraq. I described some of that on the floor of the Senate pre-viously. We paid a corporation $220 million to reconstruct 142 health clinics in Iraq. Twenty got done. The rest \u2014122\u2014never got done. A courageous Iraqi doctor went to the Iraqi Health Minister and said: Well, can I see these Iraqi clinics that were supposed to have been reha-bilitated with American taxpayer dol-lars? The Iraqi Health Minister says: Well, those were ''imaginary clinics. '' The money was not imaginary. The American taxpayer got fleeced. The money is gone. But why is it when we come to this Chamber and talk about investing in people 's lives in this country \u2014a farm- er, his wife, and two kids, who live out under a yard light, who planted in the spring, trying to make a go of it, hop-ing it would not rain too much, hoping it would rain enough, hoping it would not hail or they would have crop dis-ease or insects, hoping they would raise a crop. Finally, when they get a crop, they hope the price is sufficient so maybe they can make a living. Then, along comes a storm, an unbe- lievably devastating storm \u2014perhaps an ice storm, perhaps a torrential rain \u2014 that wipes out their entire crop, wash-es it away. Or maybe it is a drought. All of a sudden, that farmer has noth-ing. Oh, they put the seeds in the ground, but nothing came up, or they put the seeds in the ground, and it washed away. The farmer ends up with nothing. Look, the grand tradition in this Chamber has always been to provide some disaster aid to farmers who lose everything. Why? Because we want to maintain a network of family farms in this country. This is not new. We have been doing it for some long while. When we have devastating weather-re-lated disasters hit family farmers, we help them with a disaster bill. It is only recently that has become con-troversial. Twice I have run that disaster bill through the Appropriations Com-mittee. Senator C ONRAD , myself, and others put together a bipartisan bill. As an appropriator this year, I offered it with my colleague, Senator F EIN- STEIN from California, and Senator BONDfrom Missouri \u2014bipartisan. We of- fered it a third time. It is going to come to the floor now. It is in this bill, and we have people complaining about it. This is investing in our country 's strength. This is the best notion of our country to say to family farmers: You had some trouble. It wasn 't your fault. We want to help you through this dif-ficult time. Now, we have usually done this with- out great controversy. The controversy this time is because the last two times I got this through the Senate, I was a conferee and I went to the conference. The President was threatening to veto a bill that had agriculture disaster help in it for family farmers. So twice we went to conference and the U.S. House conferees, at the request of the then- Speaker of the House, Mr. H ASTERT , blocked it on behalf of the President. Well, it is here a third time and we will go to conference. This time I will be a conferee and my colleague Senator F EINSTEIN will be a conferee, Senator BONDwill be a conferee, and there will be bipartisan support on the Senate side. The difference this time is we go to the conference and the House con-ferees will come to conference having passed their own disaster bill for fam-ily farmers. This time we are going to get this to the President 's desk, at long last. Some say: Well, why just farmers? Why family farmers? There is some-thing unusual about those who produce from the land in this country. It goes back to the homestead days in sod huts out there, alone, trying to raise a fam-ily, raise a crop, make a living. We could do, I suppose, without family farmers, but it wouldn 't be the same country. You could have corporate agri-factory farms from California to Maine, but it wouldn 't be the same country. Once they control food pro-duction, then ask yourselves: What is going to be the cost of food in this country? Someone once wrote, and I have men- tioned him on the floor a few times \u2014 Rodney Nelson, in fact, a North Dakota rancher who wrote a piece of prose about ranching and farming. He asked this question, and I think it is impor-tant for the country. He said: What is it worth for a kid to know how to plow a furrow, how to teach a newborn calf to suck milk from a pail? What is it worth for a kid to know how to weld a seam? What is it worth for a kid to know how to build a door, to build a lean-to, to grease a combine, to pour cement? What is it worth for a kid to learn all of those things? There is only one university in America where you learn all of that, and that is the family farm, America 's family farm. It is an unbelievable asset to this country. We are asking for something very simple that has been done routinely prior to this President beginning to block it, and that is when trouble comes, when weather disasters wipe out an entire crop, we say to families living out there under the yardlight, trying to raise a family and raise a crop: You are not alone. This country wants to help. That is why we brought this in this bill to the floor of the Sen-ate. It won 't make anybody whole, but it does say to farmers: Maybe you will have a chance to keep going. They live on hope. How else could you plant a crop and do anything other than hope that things will work out? This country has a rich tradition of supporting family farmers, because it is in this country 's interests. The seed- bed rolls from big cities to small towns and enriches and nourishes this coun-try. We have always known that and we have always done the right thing. Family farmers have been hard hit in the last couple of years with weather- related disasters. This Congress took action with respect to one facet of those weather-related disasters. We said farmers in the Gulf of Mexico who lost their entire crops due to a hurri-cane named Katrina, you are going to get some help. The rest of you, we are sorry. Well, listen. I was supportive of saying to those farmers we are going to give you some help. It doesn 't matter to me whether it is a Katrina or a drought that doesn 't have a name or an ice storm that is not named, weather- related disasters that destroy farmers ' crops, in my judgment, ought to be re-sponded to by this Congress to say to those family farmers: This has de-stroyed your crop, but not your hope. We want to give you hope to be able to continue farming. That is what this disaster piece is all about. I am proud to stand here and support it. Those who believe this is some kind of pork do not understand what essential investment in this country 's strength is all about. An investment in America 's family farming is a good investment in this country 's future. My colleague from California who worked with me in the Appropriations VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3787 March 27, 2007 Committee to get this done is on the floor, so let me yield the floor to her and thank her for her leadership in re-sponding to these needs as well. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from California is recognized. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Sen- ator very much. Thank you, Mr. Presi-dent. I very much commend the Senator from North Dakota. I think he said it well and in a very inspiring way. If I had to summarize it, it would be that we in America try to take care of our own\u2014not only people in other nations, but people who have been the victims of real disaster in this country. The fact is we haven 't been doing it for 3 years, and the disasters have piled up: in 2005, 2006, and 2007. This package takes care of that problem. In my State, California, we suffered two dev-astating disasters in the last 2 years which have resulted in Federal disaster declarations: a heat wave and a freeze. We are currently suffering a drought. Governor Schwarzenegger has certified through March 13 a loss from the freeze of $1.397 billion. The total damage has yet to be figured. I think people don 't understand how big this was in California. We have losses in 35 out of 58 counties, many the most productive in the country, that produce more agricultural prod-ucts than 22 other States, in 40 dif-ferent types of crops. They include avo-cados, strawberries, grapes, walnuts, guavas, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, artichokes, asparagus, and celery. The losses include $817 million in damage to California 's citrus crops. Lemons, limes, mandarins, grapefruit, navel oranges, and Valencias are dead in the field. Here is what some of it looks like. This is one tree. Now, most people know Florida has oranges, but those are the oranges we make juice out of. When you eat an or-ange, a tangerine, or a grapefruit, or you put a lemon in your ice tea, those fruits are from California. But not this year. We have lost at least 50 percent of the navel orange crop, 65 percent of the Valencia crop, and 65 percent of our mandarins. My farmers need this as-sistance. Some of my colleagues are asking, why do we need to provide this fund-ing? Farmers should have their own in-surance. The answer is, in California most farmers already do have insur-ance, but here is the rub: It is not going to be nearly enough to cover the damage. Let me provide an example. Accord- ing to the Department of Agriculture 's Risk Management Agency, citrus grow-ers will be able to collect up to $311 million in crop insurance. Now, that sounds like a lot, but the farming costs for California 's citrus industry for this year's operations alone total $560 mil- lion. What do I mean by farming costs? This is the amount farmers have spent to irrigate, spray, prune, everything that is necessary to prepare a crop for harvest. But this year, there is no har-vest. Therefore, they absorb the $560 million. They also have to begin to get ready for next year 's harvest. They need to get their loans. That will also be an in-currence of $560 million in normal farming costs. That adds up to $1.2 bil-lion in regular farming costs, and only $311 million \u2014at most \u2014in available in- surance they can recoup. And they are not guaranteed a crop next year. Add on to that the $100 million these growers spent in January on wind ma-chines, irrigation, and other methods to protect their orchards from the freezing temperatures, plus the costs they are incurring now to remove the dead fruit and branches. Now, 85 percent of citrus is grown by family farmers \u2014that is just a fact \u2014not the big agricultural combines. These are responsible farmers. In fact, 75 per-cent of the citrus acres in California are insured, but again, insurance alone will not cover the needs of my con-stituents. This is why we need this as-sistance. When some people saw there was also an appropriation for dairy milk loss, some people actually laughed. I was of-fended, because in July of 2006, Cali-fornia experienced 2 weeks of blis-tering, triple digit temperatures. For 12 days the San Joaquin Valley, the most productive agricultural region of this country, had temperatures over 105 degrees. What does this mean? Well, 20,552 milk cows died and 10,738 calves died. Those are counted animals \u2014over 30,000 dead. That doesn 't include our losses in poultry. There were so many dead car-casses, the rendering plants could not handle the load. The State temporarily lifted the ban on burying dead live-stock in landfills, but that was still not enough. These cows died because of the heat. Even the cows that survived pro-duced 25 percent less milk than is nor-mal. So the death of these animals, plus the stress put on the ones still producing, resulted in more than $228 million in milk losses for my dairy-men. In addition, because regular breeding could not take place for a month be-cause of the death of so many animals, my farmers will again face at least $228 million in losses for 2007. That is why my colleague, Senator B ARBARA BOXER , has joined with me in helping us push for the addition of this relief into our emergency supplemental. This is a total of $460 million in losses. We are asking for only $95 mil-lion, and that is in this supplemental. What is more, this funding can be accessed by dairymen on the gulf coast, including Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who also suffered losses due to the hurricanes. Let me conclude. This has not been easy, and I thank Senator B YRD, Sen- ator D ORGAN , Senator C ONRAD , Senator KOHL, and Senator R EIDfor their work on this Agricultural Disaster package, and also the Republican leadership on the Appropriations Committee who ac-ceded to the request. America is a great nation, and one of the reasons we are a great nation is we don't only care about others; we care about our own. If there is ever a time when we could help our own, it is in this supplemental appropriation. So what I say is: Hands off, please. We have worked hard to get where we are. The losses have been substantial. The disasters have been large. Families who can't pay their mortgages, who lose their boats if they are fishermen, lose their farms if they can 't make the pay- ments, can be helped by this assist-ance. So I hope it remains in. I hope we resist an effort to remove this from the supplemental package. Again, I thank those who have helped with this. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C ASEY ). Without objection, it is so or- dered. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are considering the supplemental appro-priations bill. I spoke earlier about the agricultural disaster piece in that bill. I believe other colleagues will be over to talk about that as well. My col-league, Senator F EINSTEIN from Cali- fornia, just finished discussing it. She was a major cosponsor of it. I have in-dicated previously that my colleague, Senator C ONRAD , is coming. He worked to create a coalition of interest and support of the agricultural disaster piece. So when others come, I expect we will have more discussion about this important issue. I wish to talk for a moment about the supplemental appropriations bill and the issue of Iraq. Earlier, one of my colleagues was describing the issue of Iraq and the controversy that the Congress might get involved and some-how interfere and that there cannot be 535 commanders in chief. I understand that. I wish to make a couple of points about Iraq, however. The issue of Iraq, as you know, casts a shadow on virtually everything else in this country. We are spending, in terms of the lives of American soldiers and America 's treasure, an unbeliev- able amount with respect to the war in Iraq. All of us want this country to succeed. There is nobody here who doesn 't want America to succeed in whatever we are involved in. I wish to make this point: The Na- tional Intelligence Estimate has just been completed. There is a classified and an unclassified version. The un-classified version tells all of us and the American people that what is hap-pening in Iraq is largely sectarian vio-lence. It is not a fight against the ''ter- rorists. '' It is sectarian violence \u2014Shia VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May S3788 March 27, 2007 trying to kill Sunni, Sunni trying to kill Shia. That is a civil war by classic definition. That is what we face in Iraq. There is an al-Qaida presence in Al Anbar Province. We understand that. What is happening there is large-ly a civil war. Now, the head of our intelligence services in this country testified twice. The former head, Mr. Negroponte, and the current head have testified within the last 2 12months. Both of them have said exactly the same thing. They have both said the greatest terrorist threat to this country is al-Qaida, its net-works around the world, and its deter-mination to strike us in our homeland. So the greatest threat to our homeland is from the terrorist group al-Qaida. Both have described al-Qaida as oper-ating in a safe hideaway in northern Pakistan. If the greatest threat to our country is al-Qaida, if the leadership of al- Qaida is directing threats against our homeland and they are in a secure hideaway in northern Pakistan, if that is the greatest threat to our homelend, and if, in fact, what is happening in Iraq, according to the National Intel-ligence Estimate, is a civil war, then I think the question is, What better pro-tects our country? Is it beginning to extract from a civil war? After all, the Iraqi people have seen Saddam Hussein executed. They have seen the oppor-tunity to vote for their own new Con-stitution. They have been given the op-portunity to vote for their own new Government. The only question re-maining is, Do those same people have the will to provide for their own secu-rity? So the question is, What better protects our country? Is it the oppor-tunity to extract from a civil war at some point soon or is it the determina-tion to ignore the presence of the al- Qaida leadership in northern Pakistan? If we begin to withdraw and extract from a civil war in Iraq, do we then have a better capability to keep our eye on the ball, the greatest threat to our country, the leadership of al-Qaida and their network around the world? If that were the case, wouldn't this coun-try wish to begin to take action against the greatest threat to our homeland and threat to our security, the leadership of al-Qaida? That is not me describing that. That is from the National Intelligence Esti-mate, the combined judgment of the intelligence communities in our Gov-ernment. You can make a pretty strong case that Osama bin Laden, who boasted about murdering innocent Americans on 9/11/2001\u2014he still speaks to us from time to time from a ''secure hide-away,'' as described by the head of our intelligence. Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden, after all of these years hav-ing passed since 9/11, still exist. Their leadership apparently is still intact, according to the head of our national intelligence services. We generally know where they are. They are appar-ently in a country that is supposed to be cooperating with us\u2014Pakistan. The question is, Why have we not brought to justice the leadership of al- Qaida, if that is our greatest threat? The answer, I suppose, is because this country has 140,000-plus soldiers in Iraq prosecuting a war in the middle of what is now a civil war in Iraq. We can debate forever, perhaps, the conditions that got us to this point\u2014 terrible intelligence, the most unbe- lievable intelligence failure, perhaps, in the history of this country. This country told the world that the coun-try of Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction that threatened America. Now it turns out, we understand, to take one example, that the issue of mo-bile chemical weapons laboratories\u2014 that intelligence was given to us by German authorities. That came from a fabricator who is now alleged to have been a drunk\u2014a single source, perhaps drunk, fabricator persuades this coun-try to tell the world Iraq has mobile chemical labs. But it turns out they didn't. I could go on at great length about the intelligence failures. Whatever the intelligence failures were, we went to Iraq. This country went to Iraq, and a number of things have happened. We have unearthed mass graves. Several hundred thousand Iraqis were mur-dered by a brutal regime headed by Saddam Hussein. There are a number of brutal regimes in this world. We don't take it upon ourselves\u2014unless it is in our national interest\u2014to send troops to those brutal regimes. But Saddam Hussein was, in fact, a brutal dictator. He has been executed. The world is better for that. The country of Iraq has shed itself of a brutal dictator. His execution comes amid other oppor-tunities for the people of Iraq. They have a constitution, a brandnew one; they wrote it and voted for it. They have a new government. They have cre-ated and voted for that government. And now we have tens and tens and tens of thousands of American soldiers in Iraq, in the middle of a civil war. We have taken our eye off the ball because the issue really is the terrorist organizations that wish to commit acts of terror against our country. The head of our national intelligence says that al-Qaida is the greatest terrorist threat to our country. They are in secure hideaways in northern Pakistan. It seems to me that the ability to begin to extract ourselves from the middle of a civil war in Iraq gives us the oppor-tunity to put pressure on and work with other countries to bring to justice the greatest terrorist threat to this country, the terrorist organization that murdered Americans on 9/11/2001. That ought to be our overriding goal. If that is the greatest terrorist threat, it seems to me our most important job is to eliminate that threat, and sooner rather than later. So I end where I began. No one in this Chamber has a difference of opin-ion about whether we want our country to succeed. We love our country, and we want to succeed. We honor our sol-diers, and we insist, when we send America's sons and daughters to war, that they have all the things they need and the support they need to do their job. But from a policy perspective, I be-lieve this President has made very seri-ous mistakes. One of my colleagues, this morning, said the general will tell us whether things are going well. I cannot tell you how many briefings I have been in\u2014 top-secret briefings\u2014month after month after month and year after year in which the top generals have come to us and said things are going really very well, when, in fact, that hasn't been the case. Only later have we discovered it was not the case; it never was the case. It seems to me that this country has to evaluate what it can do at this point to begin to find a way to withdraw and extract from a civil war in Iraq. Per-haps there needs to be partitioning, I don't know. I know that is a tough sub-ject to introduce these days. But if there are no alternatives, perhaps you have to partition the parties fighting each other, the Sunnis and Shias, and try to find another device to deal with the issue. In any event, it seems to me it is in this country's best interest to keep our eye on the ball, and the ball here is, ac-cording to head of our intelligence, that the greatest terrorist threat to our country is the leadership of al- Qaida and their network. We have not, in my judgment, with respect to al- Qaida and the deepening problems of the Taliban in Afghanistan, kept our eye on the ball. That is one of the rea-sons there needs to be a change. This notion of ''stay the course'' or ''cut and run,'' which was the slogan\u2014 there is the slogan of the week or the slogan of the month. The administra-tion's slogan of the month last year was ''stay the course'' or ''cut and run.'' It was always a false choice that was never a substitute for thoughtful debate. It was a thoughtless chant of things that mattered very little. What matters most to this country is that we are engaged in pursuits which will provide opportunity to strengthen this country, which do honor and jus-tice to the efforts of our soldiers, and which relate to responding to the ter-rorist threat because the threat against this country is a very serious, abiding, long-term threat. All of us want to succeed in dealing with that threat. Mr. President, one of my colleagues, Senator C ONRAD , has arrived. I think he intends to speak on this agricul-tural disaster issue. Let me at this point yield the floor, and I think other colleagues will speak on the agricul-tural disaster piece I spoke on earlier. I yield the floor and suggest the ab- sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3789 March 27, 2007 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this week, the Senate will once again have the opportunity to demonstrate its support for America 's family farmers and ranchers by improving emergency agricultural disaster assistance as part of the supplemental appropriations bill. For over a year, I, along with Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle, have attempted repeatedly to convince the Congress of the United States and this administration to provide des-perately needed disaster assistance. As part of the hurricane supple- mental last year, the Senate approved an agricultural disaster package. That measure was dropped in conference as a result of opposition from the adminis-tration. The need for this legislation has only been made more compelling by the severe disasters that have hit California, Colorado, Kansas, Ne-braska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma during the final weeks of 2006. In my own home State of North Da- kota, in 2005, we had a disaster that was devastating to thousands of farm and ranch families. This is what we saw across North Dakota \u2014flooded lands, over a million acres of land that could not even be planted and another million acres of land that was drowned out. Then, irony of ironies, the next year we had a devastating drought \u2014 the third worst drought in this Na-tion's entire history, hitting not only North Dakota but right down the heartland of America. This is a farm field near my home, in Burleigh County. I live in Bismarck. This is a farm field in that same coun-ty, and you can see almost nothing growing. Here is the U.S. Drought Monitor, and they determine on a scientific basis the effect of drought across America. This is from July 25, 2006, and you can see drought right down the heartland of America \u2014in our case, ex- ceptional drought. That is the dark brown right on the border between North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014ex- ceptional drought. The next category going down the scale, extreme drought, an even broader area between the two States. We also see exceptional and ex-treme droughts in these parts of the country, and then severe drought. That is the tan. Virtually all of North Da-kota had exceptional, extreme, and se-vere drought conditions. And, of course, not just North Dakota, it was right down the heartland of the coun-try. This is a headline from July 30, 2006, from the Grand Forks Herald: ''Dako- tas the Epicenter of a Drought-Strick-en Nation. More than 60 percent of the United States in drought. '' This has been an absolutely bizarre set of circumstances: One year, ex-treme flooding; the next year, extreme drought. But that is the reality of what we have confronted, and if assistance is not provided, thousands of farm fami-lies will be forced off the land. The President 's chief economic ad- viser was in my office to visit me on another matter at the same time there were independent bankers from my State there to talk to me about agri-cultural assistance \u2014bankers talking to me about the desperate need for drought assistance. They told me and told the President 's chief economic ad- viser that if assistance were not forth-coming, they would lose 5 to 10 percent of their clients. These are farm and ranch families who work hard, who love this country, who work the land, and who are some of the most inde-pendent people you would ever want to meet. The last thing they want is a government handout, but if they do not have a helping hand extended to them, they are going to be out of business. That shouldn 't be the result. We should provide the very basic assistance we have provided in other times in other parts of the country to those who have been hard hit. Let me make certain that people un- derstand. To get any assistance, pro-ducers will need to demonstrate they have had a 35-percent loss, and they will get no help for that first 35 percent of loss. That is the floor. They have to have lost 35 percent before they get anything, and then the assistance will apply to the losses beyond 35 percent. Nobody is getting rich on this pro- gram. Some have suggested this bill will result in farmers becoming more than whole because of crop insurance. That is simply incorrect. Under the provisions, a producer receiving dis-aster assistance cannot recover more than 95 percent of the expected value of the crop, after both crop insurance and the expected market income from the crop have been deducted. This is desperately needed. It is done in a way that is fair and balanced and prevents abuse. I hope my colleagues will support it. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. f EXECUTIVE SESSION NOMINATION OF GEORGE H. WU TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will pro-ceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read the nomi- nation of George H. Wu, of California, to be United States District Judge for the Central District of California. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 minutes for debate, equally divided be-tween the chairman and ranking mem-ber of the Judiciary Committee. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with this confirmation \u2014and I expect Mr. Wu will be confirmed \u2014we will have confirmed 14 lifetime appointments to the Fed-eral bench so far this year. This is March. I mention that because, when President Clinton was in office and the Republicans controlled the Senate, there were only 17 confirmations dur-ing the entire 1996 session of the Sen-ate. For those who think there is par- tisanship in the confirmation of judges, yes, there has been. Fortunately, it has been my friends on the other side. Today the Senate continues, as we have since the beginning of this Con-gress, to make progress on judicial nominations. The Senate will consider and, I believe, confirm the nomination of George H. Wu to be a United States District Judge for the Central District of California. With this confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 14 lifetime ap-pointments to the Federal bench so far this year. There were only 17 confirma-tions during the entire 1996 session of the Senate. I have worked coopera-tively with Members from both sides of the aisle on our committee and in the Senate to move quickly to consider and confirm these judicial nominations so that we can fill vacancies and improve the administration of justice in our Na-tion's Federal courts. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 48 remaining judicial va-cancies, yet the President has sent us only 27 nominations for these vacan-cies. Twenty-one of these vacancies \u2014 almost half \u2014have no nominee. Of the 20 vacancies deemed by the Adminis-trative Office to be judicial emer-gencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 10 of them. That means half of the judicial emergency vacan-cies are without a nominee. Judge Wu 's nomination has the sup- port of his home State Senators, and I thank Senators F EINSTEIN and B OXER for their support of this nomination. Judge Wu has an extensive record of public service as a State trial judge, a Federal prosecutor, and a law pro-fessor. In his 14 years on the State trial bench, Judge Wu has served in the Los Angeles Municipal Court and in the Los Angeles Superior Court, handling an array of criminal and civil cases. Previously, Judge Wu worked on com-plex commercial matters in private practice for two Los Angeles law firms. Judge Wu has also served as a law pro-fessor at the University of Tennessee School of Law, and as an assistant U.S. attorney and later assistant division chief in the civil division of the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Central Dis- trict of California. I am pleased that the nominee before us is an Asian-Pacific American. I have urged, and will continue to urge, the President to nominate men and women to the Federal bench who reflect the di-versity of America. Racial and cultural diversity remains a pillar of strength for our country and one of our greatest VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3790 March 27, 2007 natural resources. Diversity on the bench helps ensure that the words ''equal justice under law, '' inscribed in Vermont marble over the entrance to the Supreme Court, are a reality and that justice is rendered fairly and im-partially. Judicial decisions should re-flect insight and experiences as varied as America 's citizenry. A more rep- resentative judiciary helps cultivate public confidence in the judiciary which strengthens the independence of our Federal courts. There is still much work to be done. Out of the 875 seats on the Federal ju-diciary, there are only 5 active Asian- Pacific American judges on the Federal bench, less than 1 percent of all Fed-eral judges. President Bush has nomi-nated only two Asian-Pacific American candidates during his 6 years in office, neither to a seat on a Federal circuit court. With outstanding lawyers like Dean Harold Koh of Yale, Professor Goodwin Liu of Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley, or attorneys Karen Narasaki, John Yang and Debra Yang, it is not as if there is a dearth of qualified can-didates who would be universally en-dorsed. Our Nation has highly qualified indi- viduals of diverse heritages who would help to unify our Nation while adding to the diversity of our courts. I hope the President will send us more con-sensus nominees that reflect the rich diversity of our Nation. I congratulate Judge Wu, and his family, on his confirmations today. EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS Mr. President, this emergency sup- plemental bill that we are debating today has been long seen as our best chance of extricating ourselves from the quagmire in Iraq. As one of only 23 Senators who opposed the authoriza-tion of the use of military force, I have supported every credible proposal that has come before this body to bring our troops home. The war in Iraq was not about Sep- tember 11. It was not about al-Qaida. It was not about making our Nation safer. While no one can prove a nega-tive, I believe the damage this war has done to our national security, our na-tional interest, and our international standing has been incalculable. When we had a chance to capture Osama bin Laden, the master mind of 9/11, we let him get away because the administra-tion, the Bush-Cheney administration, wanted to take our troops out of Af-ghanistan and send then to Iraq, a country that had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11. The injustices perpetrated at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo have tarnished our national reputation and leadership, and the way Iraq has be-come a rallying cry for religious ex-tremists has made the American people less safe. For whatever misguided reasons, the President started a unilateral, preemp-tive war in Iraq which has cost us thou-sands of American lives and made us less safe. I think that historians will look back at this war as one of the most costly, reckless mistakes made by any administration in this history. This supplemental contains another $96 billion to support U.S. military op-erations in Iraq and Afghanistan. I sup-ported the use of military force to re-move the Taliban from power, and I support the continued efforts of our military and NATO forces against the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. But I did not, do not, and will not agree to the use of the U.S. military to con-tinue putting our people in harm 's way in the middle of a continuing civil war in Iraq. This bill also contains money to help the people of Lebanon rebuild after the devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel last year, aid for refugees in Darfur, the Congo, Uganda, and other humanitarian crises, and to prevent the spread of avian influenza. It con-tains resources to help Kosovo as it moves toward independence, for Libe-ria to rebuild after their civil war, and to support the peace process in Nepal which finally has a chance to shed its feudal past. It contains a provision I sponsored, with the support of both Republicans and Democrats, to fix the illogical and unfair provisions in the Immigration and Naturalization Act that have been used to prevent victims of terrorist groups or members of groups who fought alongside the United States from admission as refugees or from ob-taining asylum. As the chairman of the Senate 's Sub- committee on State, Foreign Oper-ations, and Related Programs, I am also pleased to report the bill includes, for the first time, benchmarks on a portion of the reconstruction assist-ance for Iraq. We are not going to con-tinue to pour billions of dollars into no-bid contracts that have been plagued by rampant fraud and shoddy workmanship. It is about time we put an end to the practice of handing out American taxpayers ' money with no strings attached. These benchmarks re-flect what the Iraqi Government itself has pledged and what even President Bush acknowledged is necessary if the Iraqi Government is to succeed in bringing stability to that country. So there is much in this bill that I support, but despite that, I do not sup-port the funding to continue the mili-tary operations in Iraq, and I will vote against this bill unless it contains the provision relating to the withdrawal of our forces, which is similar to legisla-tion which narrowly lost in the Senate last week. I voted for it then, and I will vote for it again. The withdrawal provision in this bill is not, in some respects, as definitive as what passed the House by the slim-mest of margins last Friday. Like many others, I would have written it differently. I wanted a deadline for commencement of the withdrawal of our forces but also for completing it within a target date. I have cospon-sored legislation that contains such a deadline. But this provision represents a 90-degree change of course from the President 's policy of escalation in the middle of a civil war. It is our best hope of obtaining the majority of votes needed to begin that process. So I am confident that once the withdrawal of our troops begins, there will be no turning back. We have to remove our troops from the Iraq civil war. That argument has been made eloquently, including by former senior military officers whose credibility is unimpeachable. Retired LTG William Odom, in an op-ed piece of February 11 in the Washington Post, said it better than I ever could. It is the only way the Iraqis will make the difficult political compromises that can save their country from further de-struction. The President has threatened to veto this bill if the troop withdrawal provi-sion is included. That is not surprising for a White House that has stubbornly refused to change course even in the face of dwindling support from the American people whose sons and daughters are dying. For more than 4 years, President Bush, Vice President C HENEY and former Secretary of De- fense Rumsfeld, backed by a rubberstamp Congress, made one in-competent decision after another, arro-gantly insisting they knew best and dismissing anyone who so much as questioned their policy for ''not sup- porting the troops. '' It has been remi- niscent of the old ''soft on com- munism '' and ''soft on drugs '' refrains that were used, and still are used, for political purposes to justify failed poli-cies. None of us should be intimidated by these worn out arguments. If they want to show their support of the troops, they should do something about our VA system. Fix up Walter Reed and fix up the other facilities where we are not giving proper help to our wounded sol-diers when they return from Iraq. We Democrats want to support those troops, too, and not just to be at the parades when they go over but to be there to help them when they come back. If this administration wants to support the troops, it should have given them the equipment, the train-ing, and the armor they still don 't get in a war that has lasted longer than World War II. And they should take care of the wounded whose bodies, minds and lives have been shattered. None of us should have confidence in a failed war effort that has already wrought enormous toll in American blood, treasure, and credibility, not after the fiasco this White House has wrought. It is time for the Congress to act as the voice and the conscience of the American people. Mr. President, I reserve the remain- der of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen- ior Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to urge my col-leagues to support the nomination of VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3791 March 27, 2007 Judge George H. Wu to be U.S. district judge for the Central District of Cali-fornia. Judge Wu currently serves as a judge on the Los Angeles Superior Court, where he has presided since 1996, and before that was a judge on the Los Angeles municipal court from 1993 to 1996. He came to those judicial positions with an excellent academic back-ground \u2014a bachelor 's degree from Pamona College in 1972 and a law de-gree from the University of Chicago in 1975. He has an outstanding record in the practice of law. He was assistant professor of law at the University of Tennessee College of Law from 1979 to 1982. He was an Assistant U.S. Attor-ney in the civil division of the Central District of California office in Los An-geles from 1982 to 1989. He later served as Assistant Division Chief in the U.S. Attorney 's Office from 1991 to 1993. Judge Wu is very well qualified, rated so by the American Bar Association. They unanimously rated Judge Wu as ''well qualified. '' His nomination to the Federal bench is recognition of the contributions of lawyers from the Southern California Chinese Lawyers Association, where he was a member from 1984 until the present time. I recently spoke at the convention of lawyers from the Asian-Pacific Amer-ican Bar Association, who made the point to me that there ought to be more representation, more diversity for judges with a background from Asia and specifically from China. There are not very many judges representing that particular group. I think it is a good idea to have diversity on the Fed-eral bench among people from all walks of life, all backgrounds, all na-tional origins, all ethnic representa-tions, and applaud his nomination from that point of view, in addition to the excellent credentials which I have cited. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of his resume and background on two pages be printed in the C ON- GRESSIONAL RECORD . There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: GEORGE H. W U UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA Birth: November 3, 1950, New York, NY. Legal Residence: California. Education: B.A., Pomona College, 1972; J.D., University of Chicago Law School, 1975. Employment: Associate, Latham & Wat- kins, Los Angeles, CA, 1975 -1976, 1977 -1978; Law Clerk, Hon. Stanley N.

Judge George Wu was nominated in the last Congress, but his nomination was not acted upon prior to its adjournment. President Bush re-nominated Judge Wu on January 9, 2007. A hearing was held on his nomination on February 6 and the Judiciary Committee favorably reported him on March 1. Judge Wu is a highly qualified nominee with a distinguished record. In 1972, he earned his B.A. degree from Po- mona College. In 1975, he earned his J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School. After law school, Judge Wu became an as- sociate at the firm of Latham & Watkins in Los Angeles from 1975 to 1976. Judge Wu subsequently served as a judicial clerk for the Honorable Stanley N. Barnes on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-cuit. From 1979 to 1982 Judge Wu was an Assist- ant Professor of Law at the University of Tennessee College of Law in Knoxville, Ten-nessee, where his courses included civil pro-cedure, torts, and labor law. Judge Wu served as an Assistant U.S. At- torney in the Civil Division of the Central District of California office in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1989 and later served as Assist-ant Division Chief from 1991 to 1993. From 1989 to 1991, Judge Wu returned to private practice, this time as an associate at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae in Los An-geles. In 1993, Governor Pete Wilson appointed Judge Wu to the Los Angeles Municipal Court, which handles misdemeanor cases, preliminary felony hearings, and small civil actions. In 1996, Governor Wilson elevated Judge Wu to the Los Angeles Superior Court, which handles felony cases and larger civil suits. The American Bar Association unani- mously rated Judge Wu ''Well Qualified. '' ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES Mr. SPECTER. I note we are sched- uled to vote on Judge Wu at 12:10. As ranking member, I have the balance of the time until that period. I choose to use it to comment briefly on a letter which I received yesterday from John M. Dowd, who is an attorney for Ms. Monica Goodling, who was counsel to Attorney General Gonzales and White House liaison. In this letter, Mr. Dowd asserts the basis for having Ms. Good-ling claim her constitutional rights under the fifth amendment, and privi-lege against self-incrimination, not to testify before the Judiciary Committee on our inquiry into the eight U.S. at-torneys who were asked to resign. Mr. Dowd makes the point emphatically that in asserting this privilege against self-incrimination, Ms. Goodling is not saying she has done anything wrong and explicitly denies any wrongdoing but cites Supreme Court authority for the right of an individual to claim the privilege against self-incrimination, even those who are innocent, as well as those who might have something to hide. There is a firm assertion of her innocence by her attorney and her own affidavit. I can understand the reasons for this claim of privilege and the reasons Ms. Goodling does not want to testify be-fore the Judiciary Committee. In Mr. Dowd 's letter, he references some of my prior statements and then says: Senator Schumer has no less than five times characterized the Department 's testi- mony to date as ''false'' or ''a falsehood, '' and concluded that there have been mis-leading statement after misleading state-ment, deliberate misstatements. If a false statement has been made to a congressional committee, that con-stitutes a crime under title 18 of the United States Code, section 1001. That was the basis on which the No. 2 man in the Interior Department entered a guilty plea during the course of the past week. Where there have already been characterizations, as cited by Mr. Dowd of Senator S CHUMER 's statement that there are misleading statements which have been made, which I state is a crime, I can understand the sense of a potential witness in not wanting to be ensnared in that kind of proceeding where conclusions have already been reached by Senator S CHUMER who is in charge of the investigation. Mr. Dowd 's letter further goes on, citing comments which I had made ear-lier, ''that Senator S CHUMER is using the hearings ''\u2014this is Mr. Dowd 's statement \u2014''hearings to promote his political party. That is not a legiti-mate reason for the Judiciary Com-mittee to conduct hearings. '' I have said in the Judiciary Com- mittee hearings, in the presence of Senator S CHUMER , eyeball to eyeball, so to speak, that I thought there was a conflict of interest. In concluding there was a conflict of interest, I did not ask Senator S CHUMER to step aside. I said that was up to him. But following the testimony of U.S. Attorney Iglesias, from New Mexico, the very next day the Web site of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign had Senator D OMENICI 's picture on it, urg- ing his defeat in the 2008 election. Then, shortly thereafter, there was a fundraising letter from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to raise money, saying the Democrats were elected to clean up Washington and this is an example of what needs to be cleaned up. Any of us may be subject to comment in a political situation. Senator S CHU- MER has a right to make political hay out of whatever he chooses. But I think it is inconsistent with leading an in-quiry, and I can understand Ms. Good-ling's decision not to testify in this context. I think it is very unfortunate, VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3792 March 27, 2007 because it is very important for the Ju- diciary Committee to get to the bot-tom of what has happened with the re-quest for eight U.S. attorneys to re-sign. There is a cloud over U.S. attor-neys, and I think it has had a dis-tinctly chilling effect on all 93 U.S. at-torneys, not knowing what will come next. It is generally agreed that the Presi- dent of the United States has the au-thority, standing, right to discharge U.S. attorneys for no reason at all. When President Clinton took office, in one fell swoop he replaced 93 U.S. at-torneys and no one raised any question. But I think not if U.S. attorneys have been asked to resign and have been re-placed for an improper reason, for a bad reason. Suggestion has been made that the U.S. attorney in San Diego, Ms. Lam, was replaced because she was hot on the trail of political operatives who may have been connected to former Congressman Duke Cunningham, who is now serving an 8- year sentence; or the allegation has been made \u2014it has not been substan- tiated but it has been made \u2014that New Mexican U.S. Attorney Iglesias was re-placed for failure to prosecute a vote fraud case. An extended article in the New York Times a week ago Sunday gave extensive analysis, which might lead to the conclusion that there was justification for Mr. Iglesias 's resigna- tion, or perhaps there was not. But that is up to the Judiciary Committee to make a determination. So it is unfortunate that you have a situation where witnesses are not com-ing forward. It is my hope we would not rush to judgment on this matter, that we would avoid conclusory statements, and that instead we would wait until we find out what the facts are. If these U.S. attorneys were asked to resign for improper reasons, I will be among the first to say so. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is true Ms. Goodling 's attorney has said that she will take the fifth amendment. Now, as both a former defense attorney and a former prosecutor, I respect the right under our Constitution for any-body to take the fifth so they won 't say something that might incriminate them and bring about criminal charges against them from their own state-ments. But it is a little bit odd that in a letter from Ms. Goodling 's attorney, he speaks that she does not want to face the fate of Mr. Libby, or words to that effect. Scooter Libby was con-victed of perjury. He was convicted of obstruction of justice. While I realize many believe he is going to be par-doned, those are the reasons he was convicted. I would have assumed that Ms. Good- ling\u2014who has been a very high-ranking member of the Department of Justice, would come in and tell the truth. If she takes the fifth amendment, that 's a more difficult thing. We won 't hear from her. If she feels that what she has to tell us would subject her to criminal prosecution, well, that raises some se-rious questions. We hope that others will testify and that they will testify honestly. We 'll continue to ask people. But it is very, very difficult to get the facts when you have key members of the Bush-Cheney administration tak-ing the fifth. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on this? The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not. Mr. LEAHY. If I have any further time, I yield it back and I request the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The question is, Will the Senate ad- vise and consent to the nomination of George H.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f TONY SNOW Mr. REID. Mr. President, on a matter of concern and seriousness, in my office this morning I had a newspaper clip-ping regarding Tony Snow. He had a tumor removed and the cancer had not returned, and I wrote a letter and signed it. A few minutes later, my sec-retary brought in a news clipping that Tony Snow 's cancer has returned. I have known Tony Snow long before he became the spokesperson for the White House. My relations with him have al-ways been superb. To me he has always been very fair. I have great respect for him and his family. I want the record to reflect that I speak for everyone on this side of the aisle of our real concern. He has been a tremendously good representative for the President. He does an outstanding job dealing with some of the most seri-ous issues any person could face. He has done a wonderful job. I hope and pray that Tony Snow will again be able to whip the cancer he has already whipped once. With the good thoughts and prayers from everyone in this body and the many friends he has in Wash-ington and around the world, it will go a long way toward healing this man who certainly deserves it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re- publican leader. Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, let me join the majority leader in express-ing our best wishes, hopes, and prayers for Tony Snow 's speedy recovery. He has been a spectacular press secretary to the President. He enjoys widespread respect and admiration. We wish him well for a speedy recovery. f RECESS The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If the Senator would give us a few moments to go over that for the leadership to work that out. I do not do it as a matter of personal privilege but as speaking for our leader on this side. So if the Senator would withhold for a half an hour or so. I would have to object to it. I do not personally object to it. I object for the leadership until it has an opportunity to examine the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec- tion is heard. The Senator from Indiana. Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, may I raise a question. Will the distinguished Senator be able to respond that I have submitted the amendment, in other words, that I would not have to re-appear to resubmit the amendment at that time or is the Senator in a posi-tion to give us that assurance? Mr. President, I have already sub- mitted the amendment, and I am sub-mitting an updated version of the amendment. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, is the Senator trying to perfect his own amendment? Mr. LUGAR. Yes, and I am attempt- ing to file the amendment. It was re-quested I appear in person to do so. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator is requesting to alter his amendment, I have no objection to him doing so. Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts. AMENDMENT NO . 680 (Purpose: To provide for an increase in the Federal minimum wage, and for other pur-poses) Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, amendment No. 680 is at the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the pending amendment is set aside and the clerk will report the amendment. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. K EN- NEDY ], for himself, Mr. E NZI, Mr. B AUCUS , and Mr. G RASSLEY , proposes an amendment num- bered 680. (The amendment is printed in today 's RECORD under ''Text of Amendments. '') Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Members, as they re-member, we passed the substance of this legislation, I believe, 97 to 3. That is what is effectively the substance of this legislation. The House of Rep-resentatives has passed its own min-imum wage. Because of the parliamen-tary complexities, we were unable to get this issue resolved. The House has included a minimum wage provision in their proposal. We offer this proposal, which is an expression of the Senate. It has broad bipartisan support \u2014Republican and Democrat. This will mean both pieces of legislation \u2014the supplemental \u2014will have the minimum wage, and then the conferees will be able to make their judgment. But out of it will come an increase in the minimum wage. So it is in that spirit. I am delighted to debate the minimum wage, but I think we had a good debate. We had, I think, close to 7 days ' debate on it in the last few weeks, so I do not think that is nec-essary. That is the current situation. That is the reason that legislation is pending at this time. I very much appreciate the cooperation of the floor managers in letting us get this at least up before the Senate at this time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment \u2014is the distin- guished Senator from North Carolina intending to manage this legislation? Mr. BURR. Mr. President, the Sen- ator from North Carolina is not intend-ing to manage this side. Our manager is not here right now. I would ask the Senator from Oregon if he would with-hold setting the current amendment aside. If he wishes to talk on an amend-ment, feel free to, but at this time I would have to object to setting aside the pending amendment. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would be happy to do that. AMENDMENT NO . 709 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent to speak on the bipartisan amend-ment I will be offering as soon as we have a manager on the other side to conduct business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator is recognized. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in a few minutes I will offer a bipartisan amendment to address the great needs of rural communities across this coun-try. It is an amendment I will offer on behalf of myself, the distinguished Sen-ate majority leader, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the chairman of the Senate Energy Com-mittee; my colleague from Oregon, Senator S MITH; Senator C RAIG of Idaho, Senator D OMENICI , and a large addi- tional group of Senators of both polit-ical parties who wish to see reauthor-ized the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act which is also known as the County Payments Program. Mr. President and colleagues, with- out this amendment, there is a very real prospect small counties in the rural West are going to fall into the Pacific Ocean. These small counties are now standing on the abyss because without county payments funding, they simply are not going to be able to pay for critical services such as law en-forcement and rural education. In Oregon, the sheriff of Grants Pass told me without county payments funding, he may have to call out the National Guard to protect public safe-ty. The county commissioners of Curry County report that without county payments funding, they may have no choice but to dissolve their county al-together. Local officials in Coos Coun-ty, just at the prospect of losing coun-ty payments funds, have already re-leased prisoners from their jails. Local communities in many other States face similar hardships. Some Senators may not yet be fully aware of what the county payments law is about, so I am going to give a brief explanation of how the program has come to be. County payments are not welfare, but they are a more than 100-year-old Federal obligation that goes back to the creation of the Federal forest sys-tem. The deal was if Federal policy prevented local communities from maximizing their revenues from their forests, the Federal Government would provide a partial payment to these local communities so they could pay for essential services such as law en-forcement and schools. As environmental values changed in the 1990s, and these payments grew even smaller, Senator C RAIG of Idaho and I wrote the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. That law compensated these rural communities for part of what they needed to pay for essential services. The act has worked extraordinarily well and expired at the end of last year. In this amendment, our large bipar- tisan coalition \u2014and I read only a num- ber of the Senators from both political parties who are sponsoring this amend-ment \u2014our large group seeks to put in place a new updated lifeline to small rural counties. County payments would be extended for 5 years and a new for-mula put in place to provide greater funding to more than 80 percent of the counties in our country. The formula is based on the current funding formula for county payments and the acreage of U.S. Forest Service and eligible Bureau of Land Management lands, along with a mechanism to focus support on those communities where there is greatest economic need. In addition to the County Payments Program, this amendment also assists States with a similar program, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. This is a program which compensates States for the loss of tax revenue from VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3794 March 27, 2007 Federal lands in their State. For the first time in modern history, this pro-gram will receive full funding, and it will result in additional support for each county with Federal land. I note at this time, particularly, the exceptional work done by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen-ator B AUCUS , who, with Senator B INGA- MAN and so many of our colleagues of both political parties, has been in-volved in these efforts. As a result of those combined efforts, this amend-ment is paid for with all funding be-yond 2007 paid for by closing tax loop-holes that have been identified by Sen-ator B AUCUS , the chairman of the Sen- ate Finance Committee. This bipartisan amendment is sup- ported by a diverse coalition, including the National Association of Counties, many labor organizations, and edu-cation advocates across the country. I urge the Senate this afternoon to rec-ognize the exceptional urgency of this situation and to support the bipartisan effort to reauthorize the County Pay-ments Program and to strengthen the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. Rural communities across this coun- try have been hit with a wrecking ball. With the change in environmental val-ues, we have seen many of them, as they look to diversify their economies, reach out and find new industries, yet they have still had great difficulty in paying for essential services. As they try to meet these chal- lenges \u2014and I am committed, as chair- man of the Forestry Subcommittee, to work on finding new economic opportu-nities for these rural communities \u2014the country should not turn its back on rural America as it looks to come up with vibrant, new economic prospects for the future. These laws \u2014the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Deter-mination Act and the law that puts in place the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program \u2014provide essential funding and will be a lifeline as these commu-nities work to transition into addi-tional areas that make sense for re-source-based economies. Today, these small communities are asking the Senate to help them from falling into the abyss. The blow to rural communities, if they lose county payments, will be a crippling blow that, in my view, some rural counties simply will not be able to recover from. Mr. President and colleagues, let us remember rural America as we con-sider this legislation. I hope Senators of both political parties will join the very large block of Democratic and Re-publican Senators who offer this amendment today. Mr. President, we are waiting for a manager on the other side. A number of colleagues, particularly the Senator from Illinois, has been very gracious and very patient. I think what I wish to do is yield at this time. When a manager comes, we will resume delib-erations. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his patience. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator yields the floor. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Illinois. Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, it is my understanding that at this point we cannot set aside the pending amend-ment because we are waiting for a floor manager. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from Illi-nois, unanimous consent needs to be sought and granted in order to proceed while the Cochran amendment is pend-ing. Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, why don't I wait to find out whether it is possible for the Senator from Oregon to potentially call up his amendment. If not, then what I would like to do is speak on my amendment and find out when I can call up my amendment. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Sen- ator from Illinois has indicated he would speak very briefly. I ask unani-mous consent that the Senator from Il-linois could speak for his 5 minutes, and with the floor manager coming on to the floor, that we could then turn to the county payments legislation after the Senator from Illinois has spoken for 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I speak, if the Senator from Oregon is able to call up his amendment, I be able to call up my amendment as well thereafter. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. AMENDMENT NO . 664 Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, toward the end of World War II, Norman Rock-well created a cover for the Saturday Evening Post titled ''Homecoming GI. '' It is a picture of a soldier returning from war. He has a duffle bag clutched in his left hand. He is looking up at the back of a brick building with laundry hanging from the back porch. A woman in an apron sees him with outstretched arms, and a young child races down the stairs. Everyone sees that soldier \u2014the neighbors ' kids, the man fixing the roof, faces from another window \u2014and everyone welcomes that soldier who has come home from war. That is what our Nation did for the millions of servicemembers who re-turned from the Atlantic and the Pa-cific. We watched them come home in waves. Some were just as strong as their first day in battle; others limped. We saw them crowd Times Square. We saw them walk down Main Street and sit on stoops. My grandfather, who fought in Patton 's army, would often speak about this time as America at its finest. That homecoming didn 't just happen; we were ready for it. Long before the beaches of Normandy were stormed and the last battle was fought, in 1943 President Roosevelt said: Among many other things, we are, today, laying plans for the return to civilian life of our gallant men and women in the armed services. They must not be demobilized into an environment of inflation and unemploy-ment, to a place on a bread line, or on a cor-ner selling apples. We must, this time, have plans ready instead of waiting to do a hasty, inefficient, and ill-considered job at the last moment. These are the words of wisdom that we ignore at our peril. Today we have more than 631,000 vet- erans from Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the global war on terror. According to a recent VA health care report, one-third \u2014more than 205,000 \u2014 have sought treatment at VA health facilities. Even if the war in Iraq comes to an end soon \u2014and I hope the Senate takes action this week to accomplish that goal\u2014the war will live on with our servicemembers and their families for the rest of our lives. Unfortunately, over the past month, we have all seen the disturbing pic-tures of neglect at Walter Reed. We have read about bats and bureaucratic redtape at the VA. We have seen too many stories about our veterans who have been forgotten \u2014not greeted by the Nation that asked them to serve. The time has come for us to see this generation of veterans in all their valor and pain. We should provide them with a plan that is worthy of their courage and will help build back the military they love. That is what Senator M CCASKILL and I are trying to do with the amendment we offer today. First, we provide an additional $41 million to hire more caseworkers to as-sist servicemembers navigating the military 's bureaucracy. The last thing a wounded servicemember should have to face when they return home is a front line of paperwork and delay. Right now, the caseworker-to-service- member ratio at Walter Reed is 1 to 50. Caseworkers help recovering soldiers schedule appointments, take care of their everyday needs, and fill out pa-perwork. Military caseworkers are overwhelmed. I understand the Army is reducing the caseworker-to-service- member ratio to 1 to 17, and I applaud this move. Our amendment would help the military achieve this goal at all military hospitals. Our amendment also provides $30 million for the Armed Forces to create an Internet-based system for service-members to submit their paperwork electronically. No longer will amputees and servicemembers in wheelchairs have to go to countless offices to fill out duplicative forms only to learn that the forms have been lost in Gov-ernment bureaucracy. We also need to do more to increase the number of mental health crisis counselors available to assist recov-ering servicemembers and their fami-lies. Too many servicemembers are re-turning home with unmet mental health needs \u2014stresses that are often experienced by their family members. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3795 March 27, 2007 That is why our amendment provides $17 million for more mental health cri-sis counselors. While we all praise how our country treated the servicemembers returning from World War II, we must remember the lessons after Vietnam. The land-mark National Vietnam Veterans Re-adjustment Study was congressionally mandated in 1983, 15 years after the height of that war. The completed re-port showed the vast majority of Viet-nam veterans had successfully accli-mated to postwar life. We can 't wait 15 years to plan and prepare for the readjustment needs of the servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The average age of a servicemember deployed since Sep-tember 11 is 27. The average age of our Guard and Reserves is 33. Sixty percent of those deployed have family respon-sibilities, and 47 percent of those who have died have left families. Mr. Presi-dent, 160,000 women have been de-ployed, and 10 percent of those women are single mothers. These men and women are going to face real chal-lenges in readjusting to normal life. Our amendment would provide for a study by the National Academy of Sciences of the mental health and re-adjustment needs of returning service-members. This study will assist the De-partment of Defense, the Veterans ' Ad- ministration, and Congress in planning for the long-term needs of our vet-erans. Last week I met a woman at Walter Reed. She is one of the 160,000 women who have been deployed, and she suf-fers from post-traumatic stress dis-order. Most of us associate PTSD with men in combat, but many of the women in theater face firsthand dan-gers in their combat support roles. Driving a truck in Baghdad is one of the most dangerous missions around, and it is considered a support role. Women are witnessing the horrors of improvised explosive devices and the horrors of losing fellow servicemem-bers, and too many are experiencing the trauma of sexual harassment or abuse. This young woman was very scared, and she trembled as we spoke. I asked her what we could do to help. She said that she could not handle group ther-apy sessions; she could only tolerate one-on-one sessions with counselors. Her experience is shared by many women. Treatment for women with PTSD, especially sexual abuse victims, is very different from treatment for men. That is why as part of our amend- ment we want to provide $15 million to address the unique mental health needs of women. This funding will ensure the development and implementation of a women 's treatment program for mental health conditions, including PTSD. It will also include the hiring and train-ing of sexual abuse counselors so that the servicemembers who suffer from this trauma do not have to suffer in si-lence. We can do this for the woman I met at Walter Reed and the thousands who suffer like her. The total cost of our amendment is $103 million \u2014less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the total cost of this bill. This is the least we can do for our serv-icemembers recovering at Walter Reed and other military hospitals. I am proud that Veterans For Amer- ica has endorsed our amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that their let-ter of endorsement be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: VETERANS FORAMERICA , March 27, 2007. DEARSENATOR OBAMA : Veterans for Amer- ica commends you for fighting to ensure that the service-related needs are met of the one and a half million men and women who have been deployed in our wars in Iraq and Af-ghanistan. We commend you for fighting to enact an amendment \u2014based primarily on the provisions of the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act (S. 713) \u2014to the current emer- gency supplemental appropriations bill (S. 965). This is the most important piece of legisla- tion offered since the start of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today 's military is drastically different from any other we have ever sent to war. Too many of our troops are returning to a system that completely ignores their most urgent service-related health and readjustment needs. One fact is quite striking: of the tens of billions of dollars spent to meet the needs of America 's veterans, less than one percent is spent on this generation. We waited almost 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War to examine the specific needs of my generation through the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study. We fought hard for this study, and while we waited for its completion, tens of thousands of lives were shattered. We cannot wait that long this time. The study included in your amendment will pre-vent us from failing thousands upon thou-sands of our service members and veterans. We must stop throwing money at a broken system that does not address the most ur-gent unmet needs of today 's service members and veterans. I also want to commend your efforts to recognize the challenges faced by women service members and veterans. The needs of women troops are being effectively ignored. This is a national disgrace. Again, you have my sincere thanks and the thanks of millions of others who have proud-ly served our country. Sincerely, B OBBY MULLER , President. Mr. OBAMA. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amend-ment. At this point I turn the floor back to the Senator from Oregon, Mr. W YDEN , and I ask, if the floor managers are prepared, that I be able to call up this amendment after the Senator from Oregon does so with his amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mrs. M CCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to the Obama amendment and then go back to regular order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I apolo- gize. I should have allowed \u2014\u2014 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I could just clarify for all of us, could you tell us what the current unani-mous consent agreement has in it? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment before the Senate is the Cochran amendment. The Sen-ator from Illinois had asked unanimous consent to address the Senate for 5 minutes, and then when he completed, to yield back to Senator W YDEN to con- tinue to discuss his amendment. There was no objection. Further, after the Wyden amendment was brought up, the next amendment to be offered would be that of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. O BAMA . There was no objection. Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Missouri is recognized. AMENDMENT NO . 664 Mrs. M CCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amend-ment that will be offered by Senator O BAMA . Our amendment takes part of the legislation we have introduced, the Dignity for the Wounded Warriors Act, and moves it to the front of the line. The question which has to be asked is, Why? Why is it important that this go into this bill at this time? There is a lot of talk about what should and shouldn 't go into the supplemental. I think it is important we realize if we don't act immediately to begin to take the kind of care of our wounded they need to have, that they should have, that we are morally bound to give them, then we shouldn 't be passing any more supplemental funding for any more activities in this war. It is of primary importance to us that we take care of the men and women who have been wounded, who have given more than most Americans will ever give as it relates to this con-flict in the Middle East. I have to say, if you step back and look at this problem, it is not just the active military hospitals that this amendment deals with, but it is the en-tire system of medical care for our wounded and for our veterans. I was struck last week when a report came out on all the veterans facilities around the country. This was an inter-nal report done by the Veterans ' Ad- ministration but contained in that re-port was a startling revelation. In that report they found there was a bat infes-tation in a veterans hospital in the State of the Senator from Oregon. Now, one would think that if you found a bat infestation in a hospital alarms would go off, lights would sig-nal, and the head of that hospital would step up and say: I failed. Oh, no. The head of that hospital said the bats had been helpful to the insect popu-lation. Understand that with this par-ticular species of bat, there is more bacteria contained in an ounce of the droppings from this animal than any other species of bat. Microbiologists VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May S3796 March 27, 2007 yearn to study these droppings because of all of the bacteria that is contained in them. Something is terribly wrong when we have a veterans hospital in this coun-try that is putting up with an infesta-tion of bats, and if we don 't have it in us to fix this medical facility and all others like it in this country, then shame on us. Shame on our Nation that we can 't do what we must do to take care of those who have taken care of us. All the rhetoric about ''support the troops ''\u2014forget about it if we can 't do basic medical care for those who are coming home who are wounded. We specifically deal with that in our amendment, with the additional funds in this supplemental that we have added to the President 's budget to care for our veterans and veterans facilities. There is no job we have here that is more important. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and the addition of about $1.7 billion in funding to the supplemental for veterans care. They are both important. They are both moral imperatives. It is time we make that phrase \u2014''support our troops ''\u2014more than a political phrase. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oregon, or to go back to regular order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oregon is recognized. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment, and I call up my bipartisan amendment on county pay-ments and the payment in lieu of taxes. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, reserv- ing the right to object, I do not intend to object but for the purpose of asking if there would be any objection to my offering an amendment on behalf of the Senator from Indiana, Mr. L UGAR , and then yielding to the Senator. We wouldn 't have any debate, but we would just offer this amendment so it would be pending in the regular order. Mr. WYDEN. I would be happy to pro- ceed, but I recognize the manager on our side. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I could just clarify, is it amendment No. 690? Mr. COCHRAN. It is amendment No. 690. Mrs. MURRAY. Then we would not object. AMENDMENT NO . 690 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf of the Senator from Indiana, Mr. L UGAR . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. C OCH- RAN], for Mr. L UGAR , proposes an amendment numbered 690. The amendment is as follows: AMENDMENT NO . 690 (Purpose: To provide that, of the funds ap- propriated by this Act under the headings '' DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS '' and ''ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUND'' (except for the Community Action Program), up to $50,000,000 may be made available to sup-port and maintain a civilian reserve corps) On page 56, after line 18, insert the fol- lowing: CIVILIAN RESERVE CORPS SEC. 1713. Of the funds appropriated by this Act under the headings ''DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS '' and ''ECONOMIC SUP- PORT FUND'' (except for the Community Ac- tion Program), up to $50,000,000 may be made available to support and maintain a civilian reserve corps. Funds made available under this section shall be subject to the regular notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations. Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon. AMENDMENT NO . 709 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and to call up our bipartisan amendment on County Pay-ments and the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Oregon [Mr. W YDEN ], for himself, Mr. R EID, Mr. B AUCUS , Mr. B INGA- MAN, Mr. S MITH, Ms. C ANTWELL , Mr. D OMEN - ICI, Mrs. B OXER , Mr. C RAIG, Mrs. M BENNETT , and Ms. M URKOWSKI , proposes an amendment numbered 709. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (The amendment is printed in today 's R ECORD under ''Text of Amendments. '') Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a great many Senators of both political parties have signed on as cosponsors of this legislation: the distinguished Senate majority leader; the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman B AUCUS ; chairman of the Energy Com- mittee, Senator B INGAMAN ; Senators SMITH, DOMENICI URKOWSKI A great many Senators have agreed to be cosponsors. My understanding is that, perhaps, in a few minutes the Senate is going to be given a choice of two approaches on how to deal with this issue: the ap-proach that I and a large bipartisan group of Senators are offering this afternoon or an approach that will be offered by the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, our colleague, Senator B URR, which, in my view, is very restrictive and, unfortunately, it is not in line with what Senator C RAIG and I sought to do on a bipartisan basis back in 2000. Our law that was enacted at that time was called the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Deter- mination Act. Unfortunately, as I un-derstand it, the proposal offered by the distinguished Senator from North Carolina would, for example, make it very difficult for local law enforcement to get some of these essential dollars that have been absolutely critical to public safety for all these years. My view is that, under our bipartisan proposal, local law enforcement would have at least a fair measure of the re-sources they need to fight meth-amphetamine in local communities across the country. Our colleague from North Carolina, in his approach, would not make that possible. So I hope that, as colleagues consider this debate, they will vote in favor of the amendment I offer this afternoon, on behalf of the large group of Senators of both political parties who have been intimately involved in this program for many years. Our amendment is fully paid for through the good work of the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and I hope our colleagues will vote for our amendment and will reject the amend-ment of the Senator from North Caro-lina, which is much more restrictive and, unfortunately, forgets the second part of the legislation that is so vital to rural communities and that is law enforcement and roads and other essen-tial services. I had a chance to speak on this ear- lier, so I will be brief. Other colleagues would like to speak as well. The reality in rural America and the rural West is that communities are about to fall off a financial cliff. They are going to lose these essential funds that have been part of a Federal obligation for more than a hundred years. It is not a welfare program. It is not some kind of a handout that goes to rural communities in the West. These are communities where the Fed-eral Government owns most of the land. The local community is not al-lowed to maximize its revenues on those lands because the Federal Gov-ernment has essentially said we are not going to treat them as private prop-erty, where you generate a sale and revenue and you pay for essential serv-ices. So the Federal Government entered into an agreement more than a hun-dred years ago to provide compensation to those local communities where the Federal Government owned most of the land. What our bipartisan group wants to do is update and modernize that ob-ligation that was incurred more than a hundred years ago when the Federal forest system was established. Our amendment would resolve the budget crisis that is confronting rural communities by fully funding the County Payments Program for 2007, and then we set in place a formula that was negotiated for many months through a large group of Senators. I have the chart indicating the new formula that has been put into place. It makes it very clear that Senators un-derstand this program, because of the VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3797 March 27, 2007 will of this body, ought to be modern- ized. That is what we have done. But in addition to that effort, we have made sure the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Pro-gram, which compensates States for the loss of tax revenue from Federal lands in that State, would receive sup-port as well. And every county in our country with Federal land would ben- efit from this particular program. The emergency funding is what gets us over the first year of the program; it is a 5- year program. Senator B AUCUS has been willing because he feels strongly about making sure when the Federal Government steps in and goes to bat for rural communities, that it will be fully paid for. On the Senate Finance Committee, because of Chairman B AU- CUS's leadership, we are going to raise those funds by closing tax loopholes. I know my friend from North Caro- lina is going so speak in a moment. I wish to note, again, a number of col-leagues on the other side of the aisle who are supporting this: Senators S MITH, URKOWSKI . They have all said that this amendment is the way to go if you want to stand up for rural communities. But if you want to make a break with 100 years ' worth of history and not even give rural com-munities the opportunity to get sup-port, as they historically have, for local law enforcement, then Senators can vote for the amendment offered by our colleague from North Carolina, Senator B URR. I hope my colleagues will not do that. We are going to have two votes. One will be on the amendment I offered with that large bipartisan group of Senators I listed. I hope Senators will vote in favor of that amendment. There will be another amendment of- fered by the Senator from North Caro-lina. For the reasons I have described this afternoon, I hope Senators will vote against that. Keep in mind that under the amendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina, if you have people who are concerned about local law enforcement they are not, under the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina, going to be able to get support as it relates to law en-forcement \u2014the needed support to fight meth and to be able to protect public safety in their communities. That is why the large coalition I have de-scribed this afternoon is in favor of what I am proposing. The Senator from North Carolina has come to the floor. I have enormous re-spect for him. He is going to be the ranking member on the subcommittee. We don 't happen to see eye to eye on this issue. I point out that the prede-cessor of the Senator from North Caro-lina, Senator C RAIG, is a cosponsor of this amendment. He remembers the history from back in 2000, when we came together. It is my intent to allow the Senator from North Carolina time to offer his amendment as well, and then at that time I would like to re-spond to what the distinguished Sen-ator from North Carolina said about his amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Illinois is recognized. Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, is it pos- sible for the Senator from Oregon to yield to me briefly so I could call up an amendment? I will call it up, would not discuss it and it can then be set aside and we can immediately go to the Sen-ator from North Carolina. Mr. WYDEN. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. AMENDMENT NO . 664 Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so I may call up amendment No. 664.

Mr. OBAMA. I ask unanimous con- sent that Senators C ASEY , BAUCUS , and DURBIN be added as cosponsors. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized. Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. M CCASKILL ). Without objection, it is so ordered. AMENDMENT NO . 709 Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to resume consider-ation of the Wyden amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BURR. Madam President, I have deep respect for my colleague, Senator W YDEN . We worked together in the House. We will work together in the Senate. As he said, this is a small dis-agreement we have because I believe when you have a bill that says this money is going to be used for schools and communities, we should make a commitment that this money in fact does go to our Nation 's schools. Today, through my amendment, we have an opportunity to make an obligation to education. Seventy percent of our children in high school today graduate on time. In North Carolina it is 68 percent. That is 32 percent of students who don 't grad- uate on time. We hear on the floor of this institution state all the time that there 's a need to make a commitment to education. And I believe we need to make a commitment to it. I believe we need to make a commit- ment on this bill. This program was set to sunset this year. That means the Congress, in the past, set this program to expire, to go away; that the Federal Government had met its obligation. I don't disagree with the Senators from Oregon, Senator W YDEN and Senator SMITH, who have both been instru- mental on this. North Carolina is a beneficiary. We have a tremendous amount of public land. I think it should continue. But at a time that we are required to prioritize where we make our investment, I believe we would help every community by saying 80 percent of the new money \u2014not the money we were using up until this point but the almost $500 million of ad-ditional money per year we are going to pump into this program, all new money, that 80 percent of it ought to be used for our schools. It ought to be used for public education and ought to be there to support school construc-tion, K through 12, No Child Left Be-hind. It ought to focus on high school graduation. We should take America 's high school children from 70 percent gradua-tion and drive it to 100 percent gradua-tion. I heard the argument this was about economic development, about communities, about law enforcement. If you solve education, you lessen the need for law enforcement. The reason we need so many cops on the beat today, that we need more schools, is because our children don 't have the skills to compete in the job market. So, yes, we can add policemen and make all Federal dollars open for every community to decide how they use them, but let me assure you, if we don't educate our children, no matter how much money is pumped into those communities, they will have cancer in them. What am I doing? It is very simple. I am going to offer an amendment that requires 80 to 85 percent of the new dol-lars to be devoted solely to education. That way every community that is the beneficiary of this money \u2014Oregon, with millions of dollars, and North Carolina, with the several million dol-lars it gets. It is not enough to solve the education problem, but it shows a commitment on our part to make sure we are willing to contribute the Fed-eral dollars that are available to begin to address this cancer our kids have succumbed to. AMENDMENT NO . 716 TO AMENDMENT NO . 709 At this time, Madam President, I send to the desk a second-degree amendment to the Wyden amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. BURR] proposes amendment numbered 716 to amendment No. 709. Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To require that payments to eligi- ble States and eligible counties only be used for public schools) Beginning on page 13, strike line 22 and all that follows through page 17, line 18, and in-sert the following: ''(2) E XPENDITURE PURPOSES .\u2014Subject to subsection (d), payments received by a State under subsection (a) and distributed to eligi-ble counties shall be expended only for pub-lic schools of the eligible county. ''(d) E XPENDITURE RULES FOR ELIGIBLE COUNTIES .\u2014 ''(1) A LLOCATIONS .\u2014 ''(A) I N GENERAL .\u2014Except as provided in paragraph (3)(B), if an eligible county elects to receive its share of the State payment or the county payment, not less than 80 per-cent, but not more than 85 percent, of the funds shall be expended only for public schools of the eligible county. ''(B) E LECTION AS TO USE OF BALANCE .\u2014Ex- cept as provided in subparagraph (C), an eli-gible county shall elect to do 1 or more of the following with the balance of any funds not expended pursuant to subparagraph (A): ''(i) Reserve any portion of the balance for projects in accordance with title II. ''(ii) Reserve not more than 7 percent of the total share for the eligible county of the State payment or the county payment for projects in accordance with title III.

Mr. BURR. Madam President, it is very simple. The question before us, whether it is a side-by-side we decide on or a second-degree amendment, is: Are we going to commit to using part of these Federal dollars that States de-serve \u2014because it is in many cases in lieu of Federal payments for a tax \u2014are we going to commit those to local school systems to educate our chil-dren? That is the decision we will have. At the end of the day, I am going to support Wyden-Reid-Baucus-Bingaman, and however many more people go on the chart before we actually have a vote, but before that vote we will have a decision as to whether we are going to make a commitment to education in this country, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of that. Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I see the distinguished Senator from Arizona is here, but I wish to briefly respond to the comments of Senator B URR. When we do vote, again I would high- light that I hope Senators, on a bipar-tisan basis, for the amendment I am of-fering on behalf of the large group that includes Senator S MITH, Senator DOMENICI , Senator C RAIG, Senator MURKOWSKI , and a great many Senators on the other side, virtually every Dem-ocrat, will reject the Burr amendment. Here is the difference, and it is strik-ing. The Burr amendment, offered by our distinguished colleague from North Carolina, sets in place a Federal man-date. It is a one-size-fits-all approach that somehow we ought to decide here in Washington, DC what happens in these local communities. What I have decided, with our bipartisan coalition, is we ought to have an approach that gives local communities a lot of flexi-bility and a lot of freedom to design ap-proaches that are tailor made to their area. I have mentioned law enforcement, for example, as one critical area a local community might want to support under the approach I offer with our bi-partisan group but which cannot be of-fered under the approach of the distin-guished Senator from North Carolina, and there would be other examples as well. For example, if a community was concerned about its roads and was troubled about the prospect that their roads were dangerous, so that, for ex-ample, in the snowy seasons it would be treacherous for kids to get to school, under our amendment local communities would have the flexibility to support some of that upkeep for local roads. I have been told in commu-nities such as Fossil, in my home State, they don 't think they even have a roads program without the county payments legislation. So there are stark differences between the approach offered by the Senator from North Carolina and the bipartisan approach I am offering today with many of our colleagues. At the end of the day, the difference is the Senator from North Carolina is offering a Federal mandate which ties the hands of local communities and local school districts, and I gather is one of the reasons some educational advocates have already come out against the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina. I hope our colleagues will support the approach we are advocating today which gives local communities real flexibility, ensures that the Federal Government is keeping its obligation \u2014 its more than 100-year obligation \u2014to these rural communities, but updates it, as we have sought to do with this payment in lieu of taxes provision in our amendment and with the new for-mula \u2014a formula, as the distinguished Senator from Washington, the manager of the legislation, mentioned was ar-rived at only through some very dif-ficult negotiations with many Senators involved. So when Senators vote in a few min- utes, I hope they will support the amendment I am offering today, with the large group of bipartisan sponsors, and reject the amendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina which, in my view, is a Federal man-date that greatly limits the ability to make the best use of these county pay-ments dollars. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today in support of Senator W YDEN 's amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that would provide critical funding for a multiyear extension of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-De-termination Act and fully fund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes, PILT, Pro-gram. This amendment provides nearly $5 billion for rural schools, counties and communities through 2012 \u2014crucial to California 's rural counties, which face a devastating loss in Federal funding. Last Thursday, March 22, my col- leagues and I on the Senate Appropria-tions Committee approved the inclu-sion of $425 million in emergency ap- propriations to fund the Secure Rural Schools program for 1 year in the emergency supplemental \u2014helping to immediately address the pending budg-et crisis confronting over 700 counties in 39 States, including my State of California. This emergency funding adds $425 million to the $100 million available from the 25 percent of receipts that compensate counties for reductions in timber harvest on public lands. However, our counties should not have to rely on emergency funding year after year and be faced with such uncertainty. We must provide our rural counties with a stable funding stream so that they are not in the same dire situation next year and can plan for the future. This amendment, supported by the National Association of County Offi-cials, the National Forest Counties and Schools Coalition, and the National Education Association, would maintain a safety net for counties while gliding down funding in a predictable manner so counties can fiscally prepare for the future. Specifically, this amendment would provide $2.8 billion in funding over 5 years for a multiyear extension of the Secure Rural Schools Program. It would also provide $1.9 billion to fund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes, PILT, Program for 5 years, from 2008 through 2012. This program compensates States for the loss of tax revenue from Federal lands in the State. It would also pro-vide funding beyond fiscal year 2007 to be fully paid for by a combination of tax offsets. In addition, it would provide Cali- fornia, Oregon, and Washington with additional transition funding in the early years to minimize the effects of the overall decline of the total author-ization level to $379 million in 2011 under the Secure Rural Schools Pro-gram. The additional transition fund-ing for these States \u2014California, Or- egon, and Washington \u2014would also help counties with adjusting to the new funding formula under the Secure Rural Schools Program. The new funding formula would be based on the current formula of histor-ical payments and the current acreage of U.S. Forest Service and eligible Bu-reau of Land Management lands, along with mechanism to focus support on those communities in greatest eco-nomic need. Under this amendment, California 's counties would receive $283 million in funding from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2011 from the Secure Rural Schools Program. Without this fund-ing, mostly rural California counties would face sudden, catastrophic cuts. Counties in California would lose $57 million this year alone if the Secure Rural Schools Program is not ex-tended. Last year, California 's counties re- ceived $69 million to fund their schools and road and forest improvement projects from this program. The loss of these Federal funds would have a dev-astating impact on California 's rural counties, resulting in school closures, teacher layoffs, and some schools could even face bankruptcy or State take-over. Furthermore, essential road and forest improvement projects would be jeopardized. For example, Trinity County re- ceived almost $8 million in funding, and all school districts in the county could be faced with bankruptcy and would have to eliminate the school cur-riculum, cut one full-time school nurse \u2014leaving one nurse to cover the entire 4,000-square-mile county \u2014and cut music and arts programs. Plumas County, which received $7.5 million, would have to lay off teach-ers\u2014resulting in increased class sizes in grades K through 12 \u2014eliminate all school librarians, and close school cafe-terias. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 27, 2007 Lassen County received $4 million, and over half of the 10 school districts in the county would be faced with budget insolvency \u2014resulting in school libraries being closed, teacher layoffs, the elimination of school-based health services, and the reduction of teacher training and student textbooks. We simply cannot allow this to hap- pen. It is critical that we provide imme- diate and long-term funding to our rural counties that depend on the Se-cure Rural Schools Program for their livelihood. This amendment would also fund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes, PILT, Pro-gram, providing $1.9 billion over 5 years. This means California would receive an estimated $11 million or more in ad-ditional dollars annually on top of the $21 million the State currently receives from the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. In recognition of the reality that Federal lands pay no local property taxes, PILT compensates counties for the Federal lands within their borders. PILT compensation is especially im-portant for rural counties with heavy concentrations of Federal lands that reduce their available tax base. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so we can ensure that our Nation 's rural counties continue to re- ceive much needed resources to serve their schools and communities. Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise today in support of the funding pro-vided in the supplemental appropria-tions legislation for continuation of the Secure Rural Schools and Commu-nity Self-Determination Act, and the 5- year reauthorization of the program through the Wyden amendment. Coun-ties and school districts across this country are poised to cut much needed jobs and services without this continu-ation. Many of us have heard the ur-gent calls from constituents. The mes-sage has been clear \u2014''Please help us. '' And, I 'm proud to answer that call by supporting this reauthorization. For example, Idaho 's Fremont Coun- ty is one of the counties across the State and Nation that have been faced with a dire situation. Fremont County is looking at not only eliminating road and bridge services but also students would be impacted by a loss of nursing services for students, playground and safety equipment at elementary schools, library books, and continuing education instructions. Counties across Idaho face similar difficult emergency situations. Ideally, management of our forested land would generate the revenue nec-essary to assist with services in cash- strapped communities with large amounts of federally owned land. Un-fortunately, that just hasn 't been the case for some time. We must continue to work to remove impediments to for-est health and productivity. However, in the meantime, Congress must com-mit the resources necessary to ensure that rural communities across this country do not have to forgo road maintenance, close libraries, and make cuts to children 's education. Anything less is unacceptable. The legislation before us today would respond by fully funding PILT through 2012 reauthorizing Secure Rural Schools through 2011, reauthorizing the valuable Resource Advisory Commit-tees, RACs, and phasing down the pay-ments over time. I urge other Senators to join me in supporting this amend-ment that fulfills the responsibility to these communities that shoulder the local cost of the public lands we all enjoy. Thank you for the opportunity to share a few words. Madam President, I yield the floor. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for of-fering this amendment. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator S ALAZAR be al- lowed to speak for 3 minutes on the pending amendment, and that Senator M CCAIN, who has been waiting, follow Senator S ALAZAR with his comments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Colorado is recog- nized for 3 minutes. Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I thank my good friend, the distin-guished Senator from Arizona, and I thank Senator M URRAY and Senator WYDEN as well. I wish to make two quick points in support of the amendment Senator W YDEN and our colleagues have brought to the Senate floor today. The reality of the West in America is so much of our lands are owned by the Federal Government. We have about a third of the entire State of Colorado \u2014 and it is a big State, but it is about a third of that State \u2014that is owned by the Federal Government. In some of those counties in my State, 95 to 98 percent of the lands is owned by the Federal Government as well. So they have been dependent on payments in lieu of taxes in order for them to be able to pay the expenses of their gov-ernment. Unfortunately, what has happened over many years in the past is there has not been the full funding of the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. The consequence of that is some of these small rural counties in my State of Colorado have not had the financial wherewithal to be able to move forward with the functioning of their govern-ment. I am hopeful the bipartisan coa-lition Senator W YDEN has put together will help us move forward in the full funding of the bill. Secondly, I wish to make a quick comment about the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Deter-mination Act of 2000. I fully support that part of this legislation. I know the importance of funding for those rural school districts. The rural school dis-trict I grew up in would receive about one-half of the funding that is being spent in other school districts in the metropolitan areas. What this funding will do is help equalize the amount of funding we are putting into equal edu-cation opportunity for all people, so it doesn 't matter whether you come from a wealthy urban area or you come from one of the poorest, most rural, remote areas, there will be that funding assist-ance so everyone in America has an equal educational opportunity. Madam President, I yield the floor again, thanking my colleagues and Senator M CCAIN for yielding to me first. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Virginia be recognized for 7 min-utes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and it is so or- dered. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. M CCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. M CCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment which we will be voting on at 5 p.m. that would, according to, I believe, the unanimous consent agreement, strike the language in this bill calling for a withdrawal of American forces from Iraq. These same provisions were rejected by the Senate 2 weeks ago by a 48-to-50 vote. Now here we are debating the same provi-sions that have the same serious prob-lems. I hope they will be rejected again by the same, if not a larger, margin. Supporters of this provision say they want a date certain for a U.S. with-drawal from Iraq, but what they have offered us is more accurately described as a date certain for surrender \u2014a date certain for surrender \u2014with grave con- sequences for the future of Iraq, the stability of the Middle East, and the security of Americans at home and abroad. And they offer it just as the situation in Iraq, though still fraught with difficult challenges, is beginning to improve. The new developments argue for more effort in Iraq rather than the withdrawal advocated by this bill 's sponsors. As my colleagues know, I have been critical of the conduct of this war since 2003, and I very much re-gret that only now, 4 years into the conflict, are we beginning to imple-ment the kind of strategy that was necessary from the start: a traditional counterinsurgency strategy that em-phasizes protection of the population, economic development, and political progress, all with troop levels appro-priate for the mission. We are seeing today the emergence of precisely such a strategy. I would em-phasize this point: This new plan is not ''stay the course. '' We are not staying the course in Iraq and I would not sup-port the status quo any more than I have over the past 4 years. Nor have we VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3801 March 27, 2007 merely deployed a new commander, however capable, and additional forces. America is engaged today in a fun-damentally new strategy, a new ap-proach to the war, an approach that is already showing encouraging signs that it might succeed. Until now, U.S. forces did not at- tempt to defeat the insurgency and the terrorists, protect the population, and end the violence so political and eco-nomic progress could occur. Most American troops spent their days on large forward-operating bases making forays out into hostile territory in which they were subject to ambush. Today, U.S. troops, along with Iraqi forces, are out of the FOBs and living in small outposts. Today, U.S. forces are operating throughout Baghdad, even in Shiite strongholds such as Sadr City, Sunni areas such as Mansoor, and mixed districts such as Rashid. As of March 15, 24 joint security stations were operational, with many more planned. American forces in these sta-tions are visible every day, living among the population, building con-fidence that we \u2014and not the terror- ists\u2014will prevail. Contrary to some predictions, this has not increased U.S. casualties. And, not surprisingly, our presence has resulted in a dramatic in-crease in actionable intelligence about terrorists. You might not know it from reading newspapers or watching the evening news, but in Iraq today there are real signs the new strategy is working. I wish to spend a few moments outlining some of this progress, not to paint an overly rosy scenario but, rather, to correct what has become an almost sin-gle-minded focus in the Congress on the prospects of defeat. The debate in Congress has an ''Alice in Wonderland '' quality about it: We are debating ef-forts to micromanage a conflict based on what the conditions were 3 months ago, not on what the reality is today. Conditions have changed in Iraq. The Baghdad security plan \u2014the ''surge ''\u2014is working far better than even the most optimistic supporter had predicted. The progress is tangible in many key areas despite the fact only 40 percent of the planned forces are in Iraq. Allow me to review some specifics. In Baghdad, the military has re- ported an increase in real-time, action-able intelligence provided to U.S. and Iraqi forces by a newly confident popu-lation. Prime Minister Maliki, who prevented U.S. troops from conducting certain Baghdad operations last year, has given the green light to American incursions throughout the city, includ-ing Shiite strongholds. All of the Iraqi army battalions called for under the plan have arrived, many at or above 75 percent of their programmed manning levels. Bomb attacks and murders are down since the surge began. Civilians killed in Baghdad numbered 1,222 in December, 954 in January, and fell to 494 in February. There are reports of Sunni and Shia moving back into neighborhoods from which they had fled constant and horrific violence. Markets that have been subject to hor-rific car bombings have been turned into pedestrian malls that facilitate commerce and thwart terrorists. Moqtada al-Sadr has fled, possibly to Iran, and has ordered his followers not to oppose the new Baghdad security plan. The Madhi army, purportedly dedicated to the expulsion of Ameri-cans from Iraq, does not today openly challenge either U.S. or Iraqi forces. American troops are engaged in recon-struction efforts in Saudi City, with the cooperation of the local mayor. In the western part of Baghdad, our troops are establishing new outposts in areas \u2014these areas here \u2014that have been conduits for al-Qaida in Iraq pene-tration into the capital city, and have begun to clear these areas of terrorists and insurgents. The net result of all of this is key Shiite leaders are now claiming the Baghdad security plan was their idea, and are taking credit for the increase in security \u2014a develop- ment that would have been unthink-able 3 months ago. There is progress outside Baghdad as well: Throughout Anbar Province, Sunni sheikhs have banded together to fight al-Qaida in Iraq, and are pouring re-cruits into the police forces. Sixteen of twenty-six tribes in that western prov-ince are now working against al-Qaida. With numerous senior al-Qaida leaders killed or captured, the younger, less experienced leaders are making mis-takes, such as targeting respected sheikhs and murdering children, that have alienated Sunnis and their lead-ers. In the town of Ramadi, hundreds of Iraqi police last week conducted a major sweep. In the surrounding areas \u2014all of these surrounding areas \u2014 including Haditha and Hit, U.S. and Iraqis are conducting operations against al-Qaida and insurgents while protecting the population. In Diyala Province U.S. forces ex- pelled al-Qaida forces from one of their major bases in January, seized major weapons caches, disrupted fighter net-works, and cleared cities and villages of al-Qaida fighters. A U.S. Stryker battalion has reinforced Diyala and is conducting major operations against AQI forces seeking to reconstitute. At the same time, other U.S. forces in Diyala are acting against rogue Mahdi Army leaders in the province and are holding the Diyala and Tigris Rivers to combat re-infiltration into Baghdad. On the belt to the south of Baghdad, al-Qaida has come under heavy U.S. pressure in recent weeks, with Amer-ican forces destroying car bomb fac-tories and uncovering major weapons caches in areas such as Yusufiya, Latifiya, and Salman Pak. In Mosul, U.S. and Iraqi forces have killed and captured numerous al-Qaida operatives since December. In Samarra, American and Iraqi troops have captured al-Qaida facilitators and north of the city, Salahuddin Province, American troops have moved off of their forward oper-ating base and into the town of Bayji, an important hub on the road network. These developments, which have oc- curred just 1 month into the new strat-egy and with only a portion of the five additional U.S. brigades having yet de-ployed, suggest that, at long last, we have a strategy in Iraq that is suc-ceeding. That is not to say that all is going well in Iraq; clearly, it is not. Vi-olence continues, the Mahdi Army re-cently launched an attack in Basra, and one of Iraq 's vice presidents was gravely wounded in a bomb attack. But we all know the negatives; we read about them every day and see them flash across our television screens hourly. The enemy knows how atten-tion-getting car bombs are, and their strategy reflects this understanding. We must try to stop such events, and push the Iraqi Government to move forward with its reconciliation efforts and meet the benchmarks laid out by the President. What we cannot do, and, for the sake of America 's vital national security interests, we must not do, is give up just at the moment we are starting to turn things around in Iraq. Yet in the face of this new reality, the proponents of the legislation offer one prescription for the future: with-drawal of U.S. forces. Despite the progress, despite the ongoing need for U.S. troops to stabilize Iraq and pave the way for a political solution, despite the moral burdens we have incurred as a result of our decision to topple Sad-dam Hussein, and, above all, despite the catastrophic consequences for vital U.S. interests that would follow a pre-mature withdrawal from Iraq, the sponsors of this legislation would force precisely that. To those who believe that the best course is to withdraw, I ask: Can you explain to the American people pre-cisely what you believe to be the con-sequences of this action? If we follow the timetable included in this bill \u2014to withdraw troops whether or not we are succeeding or failing; regardless of whether the country is secured; irre-spective of whether the Iraqis can man-age their own affairs alone, or whether the forces of terror and chaos will tri-umph \u2014if we follow this timetable we risk a catastrophe for American na-tional security interests. Note that American national secu- rity interests are directly at stake. Not just Israeli interests, though Prime Minister Olmert has said that defeat in Iraq could be devastating for his coun-try. Not just for our Arab friends and partners in the region, though they fear the consequences of massive hu-manitarian displacement, growing Ira-nian influence, and wider bloodshed. Not just for the Iraqis themselves, for whom genocide is a real prospect should sectarian violence spiral out of control. But for America. Success or failure in Iraq is the transcendent issue for our foreign policy and our national security. People say they want to de-feat the terrorists. But if we withdraw VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3802 March 27, 2007 from Iraq prematurely, it will be the terrorists ' greatest triumph. Withdrawing before there is a stable and legitimate Iraqi authority would turn Iraq into a failed state, in the heart of the Middle East. We have seen a failed state emerge after U.S. dis-engagement once before, and it cost us terribly. In pre-9/11 Afghanistan, ter-rorists found sanctuary to train and plan attacks \u2014including attacks against America \u2014with impunity. If we leave Iraq based on an artificial time-table, al-Qaida will be free to plan, train for and conduct operations from Iraq just as they did from Afghanistan. We cannot make this fatal mistake twice. If Iraq descends into chaos, the power vacuum there will invite further Ira-nian interference, at a time when Tehran already feels emboldened. Iraq's neighbors, from Saudi Arabia to Egypt to Turkey, would feel their own security eroding, and may intervene on the side of particular factions. This un-certain swirl of events could spark re-gional war severely damaging to Amer-ica's fundamental security interests. And we would then face a terrible choice: watch the region burn, watch the terrorists establish new bases, with profound implications for the safety of Americans and their economic well- being, or send troops back into Iraq once again. The proponents of withdrawal state that they envision no such catas-trophe; they are not advocating a pre-cipitous withdrawal but something more gradual, and they would leave American troops in place to focus on three limited objectives: protecting co-alition personnel and infrastructure, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting targeted counter-terrorism operations. But if these three missions sound familiar, that 's because they formed the centerpiece of the strategy that was failing up until the beginning of this year. They would forbid counterinsurgency operations, protec-tion of the population, and the other elements of our new strategy that are directly responsible for the successes we have seen this year. This legislation is a plan for failure. But neither failure nor success is the objective of its spon-sors. They wish to get out of Iraq, whatever the consequences for Amer-ica. They conceive no failure as worse than remaining in Iraq and no success worthy of additional sacrifice. They are wrong, terribly, terribly wrong. These provisions draw a false distinc- tion between terrorism and sectarian violence. Let us think about the impli-cations of ordering American soldiers to target ''terrorists, '' but not those who foment sectarian violence. Was the attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra a terrorist operation or the expression of sectarian violence? When the Mahdi Army attacks government police stations, are they acting as ter-rorists or as a militia? When AQI at-tacks a Shia village along the Diyala River, is that terrorism or sectarian vi-olence? What about when an American soldier comes across some unknown as-sailant burying an IED in the road? The obvious answer is that such acts very often constitute terrorism in Iraq and sectarian violence in Iraq. The two are deeply intertwined. To try and make an artificial distinction between terrorism and sectarian violence is to fundamentally misunderstand al- Qaida 's strategy which is to incite sec- tarian violence. To say that targeting terrorist violence is allowable while stopping sectarian violence is illegal flies in the face of this reality, and would make it impossible to fight this war against terrorism, let alone prevail in it. Some Senators have taken a different tack, arguing that Iraq is still win-nable but that, by withdrawing troops, we will actually maximize the chances of success. They concede that a with-drawal will encourage insurgents and terrorists to unleash greater violence on the Iraqi people, but believe that such violence might induce Iraqi politi-cians to make the political decisions necessary to end it. Could this possibly be true? Can we, by withdrawing our troops from Iraq, actually increase the stability in Iraq rather than risk catas-trophe, and induce a political solution rather than make it less possible? Is success in Iraq as simple as issuing re-deployment orders, a move blocked only by stubborn commanders and ci-vilian authorities? GEN David Petraeus, for one, be- lieves that it is not. Of course the dire situation in Iraq demands a political solution. That is undeniably true. But a political solution among the Iraqis cannot be simply conjured. It is impos-sible for meaningful political and eco-nomic activity to take place in an en-vironment as riddled with violence as Baghdad has been. Security is the pre-condition for political and economic progress, and without security, we will not see the political progress all of us agree is necessary. In this regard, there are positive indications. Prime Min-ister Maliki went to Ramadi to reach out to Sunnis, and the Iraqi Govern-ment is pushing through a new de- Baathification law. The oil revenue sharing law has been approved by the Council of Ministers and should be ap-proved by parliament soon. Reports in-dicate that Iraqi officials are in discus-sions with a number of non-AQI Sunni insurgent groups, while fighting has broken out between AQI and Sunni in-surgents. Reconciliation is not the inevitable outcome of the new strategy. On the contrary, there is no guarantee of suc-cess. What the situation demands is not a guarantee, but rather a strategy designed to give us the best possible chance for success. This, I believe, is what the new plan represents. The provisions our amendment would strike would force redeployments of U.S. forces within 120 days, and nearly all troops would have to leave Iraq by March 31, 2008. This does not incentivize the Government of Iraq to make tough decisions on reconcili-ation; it sets the stage for the Govern-ment 's collapse. This arbitrary dead- line informs our enemies when they need no longer fear American military power. It signals to the population that their best bet for security really does rest in the hands of militias, rather than the Government. It demonstrates to the Government that they cannot rely on us \u2014after all, we are pulling out regardless of the situation or the con-sequences. And it tells the terrorists that they \u2014not we \u2014will prevail. All of us want to bring our troops home, and to do so as soon as possible. None of us, no matter how we voted on the resolution authorizing this war, be-lieves the situation that existed until recently is sustainable. But there is a new situation, a new reality in Iraq. This amendment ignores that reality and ignores the consequences that would flow from its adoption. When Congress authorized this war, we com-mitted America to a mission that en-tails the greatest sacrifice a country can make, one that falls disproportion-ately on those Americans who love their country so much that they volun-teer to risk their lives to accomplish that mission. When we authorized this war, we accepted the responsibility to make sure they could prevail. When we voted to send them into battle we asked them to use every ounce of their courage and fortitude on behalf of us. This body unanimously confirmed General Petraeus. Why would we now deprive him of the opportunity to pur-sue the strategy he helped design and believes can work? Why would we hand our enemies a victory when we have fi-nally taken the initiative and they are on the defensive? Let us give him and the soldiers he has the honor to com-mand, Americans who are risking ev-erything so that this new plan can suc-ceed, the time necessary to achieve its objectives. And let us elected officials who have the honor of overseeing the conduct of our soldiers ' mission in Iraq exercise a lesser magnitude of courage \u2014our polit- ical courage on behalf of them and the country they serve. If any Senator be-lieves that our troops ' sacrifice is truly in vain, the dictates of conscience de-mand that he or she act to prevent it. Those who would cut off all funding for this war, though I disagree deeply with their position, and dread its con-sequences, have the courage of their convictions, and I respect them for it. If, on the other hand, you believe, as I do, that an increase of U.S. troops in Iraq, carrying out a counterinsurgency mission, provides the best chance for success in Iraq, then you should give your support to this new strategy. It may not be popular nor politically ex-pedient, but we are always at our best when we put aside the small politics of the day in the interest of our Nation and the values upon which they rest. Those are the only responsible, the only honorable choices before us. There VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3803 March 27, 2007 are no others. I wish there were. But here we are, confronting a political, military and moral dilemma of im-mense importance, with the country 's most vital security interests and the lives of the best Americans among us at stake. May God grant us the wisdom and humility to make this difficult judgment in our country 's best inter- ests only, and the courage to accept our responsibility for the consequences that will ensue. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, under the previous unanimous consent agreement, at 3:45 we will return to the Cochran amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Vir-ginia, Mr. W EBB, proceed for up to 8 minutes and that the time remaining until 3:45 be allocated to the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. G RAHAM . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. AMENDMENT NO . 692 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Virginia. Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my amendment No. 692. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the amendment. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Virginia [Mr. W EBB] pro- posed an amendment numbered 692. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran) At the appropriate place, insert the fol- lowing: SEC. ll. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN IRAN. (a) P ROHIBITION .\u2014Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be obligated or expended for military oper-ations or activities within or above the terri-tory of Iran, or within the territorial waters of Iran, except pursuant to a specific author-ization of Congress enacted in a statute en-acted after the date of the enactment of this Act. (b) E XCEPTIONS .\u2014The prohibition in sub- section (a) shall not apply with respect to military operations or activities as follows: (1) Military operations or activities to di- rectly repel an attack launched from within the territory of Iran. (2) Military operations or activities to di- rectly thwart an imminent attack to be launched from within the territory of Iran. (3) Military operations or activities in hot pursuit of forces engaged outside the terri-tory of Iran who thereafter enter into Iran. (4) Intelligence collection activities of which Congress has been appropriately noti-fied under applicable law. (c) R EPORT .\u2014Not later than 24 hours after determining to utilize funds referred to in subsection (a) for purposes of a military op-eration described in subsection (b), the President shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the de-termination, including a justification for the determination. Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I have been on the Senate floor on a number of occasions to discuss the amendment which I am introducing today. I intro-duced it on March 5 as S. 759, which is a bill to prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran without the consent of the Congress. I am offering this legislation today as an amendment to the fiscal 2007 emergency supple-mental appropriations bill, with the support of the chairman of the Appro-priations Committee. This bill has received a good bit of discussion and also a good bit of cor-respondence from various citizens groups that have gone to Members ' of- fices. I will not take a great deal of time in terms of going through a lot of the debate about it. I would like to say at the outset that I have taken great care in the preparation of this amend-ment to ensure that it will not in any way prevent our military forces from carrying out their tactical responsibil-ities in places such as Iraq and in other areas that are on the coastlines and border lines of Iran. But I would like to emphasis that, in my view, this amend-ment is essential to revitalizing the constitutional health of our govern-mental process. The purpose of this legislation is to restore a proper balance between the executive and legislative branches when it comes to the commencement of war. Any general attack on Iran would be, beyond cavil, a commence-ment of a new war in a region that is already enduring two costly and debili-tating wars. If this action is to be taken, it should be done only with the full and considered consent of the Con-gress. At the same time, the legislation al- lows American forces to directly re-spond to attacks or possible attacks which might be initiated from Iran, as well as those which might be begun elsewhere and then carry over into Ira-nian territory. Specifically, the amendment requires that the President seek congressional authorization prior to commencing any broad military action in Iran, and it al-lows the following exceptions: first, military operations or activities that would directly repel an attack launched from within the territory of Iran; second, those activities that would directly thwart an imminent at-tack that would be launched from Iran; third, military operations or activities that would be in hot pursuit of forces engaged outside the territory of Iran who thereafter would enter Iran; and finally, those intelligence-collection activities that have been properly no-ticed to the appropriate committees of Congress. The major function of the amend- ment again is to restore the constitu-tional balance. No administration should have the power to commence unproved military activities against Iran or any other nation without the approval of the Congress, but the issue of the day is Iran. I am offering this amendment partly due to my concern over President Bush 's signing statement which accom- panied the 2002 congressional resolu-tion authorizing the use of force in Iraq. That amendment, if you read it carefully, indicates that this adminis-tration believes it possesses the broad-est imaginable authority to commence military action without the consent of the Congress. It should not be left un-answered by this body. This amendment will not take any military operations off the table, any options off the table. It will not tie the hands of this administration if our military forces are actually attacked from Iranian soil or territorial waters or by forces that retreat into Iranian territory. This is responsible legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from South Carolina. Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I understand I have 7 minutes; is that correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has until 3:45 \u20149 minutes. Mr. GRAHAM. I was going to yield to Senator C OBURN . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma is recognized. Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendments and set them aside. That way, they can be considered as called up. Senator G RAHAM has graciously al- lowed me some of his time to do that. The amendment Nos. are 648, 649, 656, 657, 715, 717, and 718. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator would hold and let us take a quick look at that. Perhaps Senator G RAHAM could go ahead and use his time. We will talk, and then when Senator G RAHAM is done, before we begin the debate on the Cochran amendment, we can work with the Senator on an agreement on those amendments. I object at this time, and I will work with the Senator to work out those amendments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from South Carolina. Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to associate myself with the comments of Senator M CCAIN about what is going on on the ground in Iraq. I thought he did an excellent job of ex-plaining that this new strategy is just what it is described as being \u2014new. We are not sending more people to do the same old thing. It is a fundamentally different approach to how we handle the situation in Iraq. The situation in Iraq is the result of not having enough forces on the ground in the early parts of the war. The secu-rity environment in Iraq got out of control. The terrorists seized an oppor-tunity to divide the Iraqis by bombing the Samarra mosque, the third most holy site in the Shia region in Samarra. Ever since then, we have been in a conflict between Shias and Sunnis in Baghdad. Anbar has always been about Sunni insurgents trying to topple this infant VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3804 March 27, 2007 democracy, and it has been the place where al-Qaida has been hiding. The progress is that the Sunni insur- gency \u2014the tribal chiefs are beginning to understand that their lives are bet-ter with the unified Iraq; that if they can share in the oil revenues of the country, future Sunni generations will be benefited. I think Shias are begin-ning to understand that to reject Al- Sadr\u2014his view of Iraq becoming a Shia theocracy is not going to be accepted by people in the neighborhood and other folks living in Iraq. So I think every group is beginning to understand that through political reconciliation, they have a better, brighter future. The way to get political reconciliation is to control the violence. That is why we need more troops, more troops to hold areas previously cleared, to buy time for political reconciliation and economic progress, and the early indi-cations are that it is working. Now, what is not working. The Con- gress is not working. I think the Con-gress is about to make history in all of the wrong ways. Do we really want to be the first Congress \u2014maybe ever in the history of the country, that I am aware of \u2014that would, by congressional enactment, set a hard date to withdraw from a war in Iraq with which our vital national security interests as Ameri-cans are intertwined? What are the consequences of leaving in March or any other date in 2008? What happens when we leave? No one who is offering these amendments has really thought that through. I do believe that a failed State in Iraq jeopardizes our national security interests for decades, is a loss in the war on terror, is an empowering event for extremists, a death blow to modera-tion, and that we need to see this through by changing course, and this is exactly what we are doing. Setting a timeline for withdrawal is saying you have no confidence in Gen-eral Petraeus to execute the plan we sent him to execute. It is saying we have no confidence in our military to deliver, because the day you set that date, you are going to freeze political reconciliation. People are not going to do deals the same way when they know America is going to leave at a certain date because what happens when Amer-ica leaves will be thought of in terms of the consequences of a particular deal. If we leave and Iraq is in chaos, the police and the army are unable to deal with the wolves of terrorism, then they are overwhelmed, the country breaks apart, and the regional consequences and the consequences to the world are monumental, in my opinion. The first rule of medicine is to do no harm. It should be the first rule of poli-tics. And we have done harm with our Iraqi strategy. We have assumed the best and never planned for the worst. Whatever mistakes the Bush team has made, and there are many, the Congress is about to make the greatest mistake of all; that is, to tell the enemy what they have to do to get us out of Iraq on their terms, not ours. It is a death blow to moderation. Who in the Mideast will try to come together knowing that the United States cannot be counted on? What effect would it have on the worldwide terrorist net-works if they believe, through their acts of violence and barbaric behavior, that America will leave? We cannot let suicide bombers deter- mine the fate of the 21st century. We cannot let people who will blow up children in a car determine the fate of Iraq. We cannot let that happen. We are bigger than that. We are better than that. I believe passionately, after five visits, with one more to come, that the people in Iraq want more. They are dying for their own freedom. I would leave tomorrow if I thought the Iraqi people were incapable of solving their problems. I do believe the majority of Shias, Sunnis, and Kurds want the same thing that every Member of this body wants for their family \u2014a better life. They have looked into the abyss, and they are making the changes they need to make. If we restrict funding, if we restrict our military commanders ' ability to go after the enemy in all of its forms, we are doing them a disservice. If you set a hard deadline for withdrawal, you have doomed us as a nation to lose in Iraq. What good would it be for one person to be maimed or to die waiting on that day to come? If you pick March 2008, what do you tell a family member of the U.S. military why their loved one died or was harmed, knowing that the date killed our efforts to be suc-cessful? This is irresponsible. This does everything wrong that the Congress could do at a time when things could get better. I cannot promise you success. But I know our last best chance lies with General Petraeus. Our last best chance lies with a reinforcement of a country and a military that needs it. The mili-tary needs this money. They deserve this money without strings attached. They deserve a chance to turn Iraq around to make us free. The House may be satisfied with this vote on the supplemental, and they may think this is a victory for the Democratic leadership in the House. I think this is a shameful chapter in the history of the House. These votes to pass this bill were literally bought. There is money in this bill, the supple-mental bill, that has nothing to do with the military, nothing to do with Iraq, and there was money being spent to buy votes to make sure we drive ourselves out of Iraq without con-sequence and the thought of what hap-pens. If we do not pass a supplemental soon, Secretary Gates has laid out what happens in April, May, and June to our military. Because of time limi-tations, I will not go into detail on what happens to the military, but I can tell you with certainty that the mili-tary needs this money for ongoing op-erations, and every month and week that goes by without this money going into the Department of Defense, major decisions have to be made that com-promise troop safety, that hurt the quality of life of families, and keep this surge from being successful. If your goal is to end this war be- cause you think we have lost, choose an honorable path. The honorable path would be to come to this floor, offer an amendment to stop funding now and get out of Iraq as soon as possible. A date certain a year from now, a year and a half from now, whatever date you pick, it ensures we lose, and it ensures that the people who are left there to fight until that day comes get injured and die in vain. This is the wrong way to run a war. This is the wrong way to fight ter-rorism. Three weeks ago, I was at Guanta- namo Bay listening to Shaikh Moham-med, the mastermind of 9/11, explaining why he was at war with us. He will be at war with us until his last breath. There are people like him in Iraq meas-uring us as a nation. Please do not send them the wrong signal. Fund our troops without condition. Stand behind General Petraeus because he deserves our support. We sent him off to do a mission. Give him the resources to do it, and in time we will figure this out. This is not an open-ended commitment. I know as well as everybody else that we are not going to be in Iraq forever. But we need to be in Iraq on terms that will em-power moderates and deflate extrem-ists. I believe the Iraqi political leader-ship, given the breathing space, will have the ability, with our support, to reconcile their country because it is in their best interests. Literally thou-sands of Iraqis have died for their own freedom. What more can we ask of someone. Political reconciliation is hard. It took us 13 years to write our Constitution. We were at civil war among ourselves. Democracy is hard, but it is worth fighting for. AMENDMENT NO . 643 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. TESTER ). The Senator from Wash- ington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, under the previous consent agreement, for the information of all Senators, we are now going to the debate on the Coch-ran amendment; is that correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5 p.m. is for debate with respect to amendment number 643, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. B YRD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from West Virginia is recognized. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from Washington. While I oppose the amendment by the Senator from Mississippi, I thank him for his courtesy in bringing this bill to VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3805 March 27, 2007 the floor. In order to facilitate Senate action on this critical supplemental bill, the Senate Appropriations Com-mittee reported a bill by voice vote on Thursday, March 22. Again, I thank the able Senator from Mississippi, Mr. C OCHRAN , for his support. In this 2007 supplemental, the Con- gress is providing nearly $100 billion to support our military and diplomatic ef-forts in Iraq and Afghanistan. This brings total appropriations for the wars to nearly $170 billion for this year alone. When Congress approves this supplemental, it will have appropriated $448 billion for the war in Iraq. As the conflict in Iraq enters its fifth year, more than 3,220 members of the uniformed services have sacrificed their lives, with over 24,000 more wounded, many grievously wounded. The Iraq conflict most certainly has become a civil war. The American peo-ple need to know what we are accom-plishing by remaining in Iraq. How much longer will Congress continue to blindly write checks for this failed strategy in Iraq? Supporting the troops means doing all we can to remove them from this violent internal sectarian conflict in Iraq. The American people have made it very clear where they stand on this matter. A large majority of Americans, according to any number of polls, wants the troops home, and the sooner the better. I, for one, am not so stub-born that I will keep marching on to-ward some intangible success in Iraq, no matter how many may die, no mat-ter how many may be wounded, and no matter how many families are torn apart by grief. A continued U.S. pres-ence is a catalyst for violence in Iraq and in the region. It is time to remove that spark from this volatile situation and pursue a diplomatic track which may lead to a national reconciliation for the people of Iraq. The language in this bill encourages a decrease in Iraqi reliance on U.S. troops to keep the peace in Iraq and pave the way for the Iraqi people to take steps toward national reconcili-ation. The language in the bill is not Draconian, nor is it precipitous. It is simply a recognition of the reality of the situation in Iraq. It calls for a gradual redeployment of U.S. troops in conjunction with concerted efforts to train and equip Iraqi security forces while building regional and inter-national support for the Iraqi Govern-ment. The language permits continued counterterrorism operations by U.S. forces and allows a limited number of U.S. forces to remain in order to pro-tect U.S. and coalition personnel and infrastructure. That is not a precipi-tous withdrawal. It is not cutting and running. Rather, it is a commonsense compromise between those who want all the troops home now and those who advocate a continued massive Amer-ican presence in Iraq. It is time \u2014yes, time \u2014to change course in Iraq before 3,000 more Ameri-cans and thousands more Iraqis are killed. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment to strike section 1315(a) and (b) of the bill. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. COCHRAN. I yield the distin- guished Senator from Louisiana 5 min-utes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Louisiana is recognized. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to encourage all of my colleagues, Demo-crat and Republican, to support the Cochran amendment as a responsible action. The situation in Iraq is deeply controversial and divisive. As we de-bate it, everyone here and in the coun-try say they are clearly for supporting our troops in the field and giving them what they need once they are put there to do their mission. That is why just a week or two ago huge numbers of Mem-bers of the Senate supported the Gregg resolution, 82 Senators saying clearly: We are going to support the men and women in uniform in the field; like-wise, they supported in huge numbers the Murray resolution, 96 Senators, to support the men and women in uniform in the field. I am afraid the path some are urging us to go down today belies that state-ment, contradicts that statement, and does not support those men and women in uniform in the field. We all know the consequences of the Reid language. That language insists that the President pull our troops out of Iraq on a date certain with no regard at all for the conditions on the ground or the progress being made by our troops or the Iraqi Government. It micromanages the war, taking what is in the purview of the Commander in Chief and bringing it to Congress. The Reid language will absolutely draw a veto from the President. What would that do? It would delay for a signifi-cant amount of time getting aid, money, help, and equipment to our troops in the field. We should not go down this path. This language will earn a veto from the President. Indeed, it would earn a veto from any President because it micro-manages his responsibilities as Com-mander in Chief, and that will delay getting resources to folks in the field. Our military leadership has said in no uncertain terms that they must get this supplemental funding to support the troops in the field by mid-April. This language will push all of that well beyond that deadline, will delay it by 5, 6 weeks or more, and endanger our troops in the field by not getting them the resources and equipment they need. That is not right. That is exactly con-trary to what almost all Members of this body have spoken for: supporting our troops in the field. This supplemental appropriations bill also has important help for the vic-tims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the gulf coast, emergency measures that are supported by the President and the Congress but have not yet been fully funded. Just as we are playing politics potentially with our troops in the field with this veto scenario, we would be playing politics with this lan-guage, drawing a veto from the Presi-dent, with the victims of the worst nat-ural disaster in U.S. history. That is not right. It is politics over people. Worse than that, it is politics over our people in uniform. It is politics over our people who suffered the worst nat-ural disaster in history. We should not go down this path. We should not be so cynical and callous. We should put our people in uniform first and get them the funds and support they need in the field as we promise to do speech after speech after speech. Words are cheap. Actions, votes lead to consequences. That is what this de-bate and what these votes are all about \u2014supporting our troops in the field, supporting the victims of the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Ne-braska, Mr. H AGEL . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Nebraska. Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, there will be no victory or defeat for the United States in Iraq. There will not be a mili-tary solution to Iraq. Iraq belongs to the 25 million Iraqis who live there. It does not belong to the United States. Iraq is not a prize to be won or lost. We can help the people of Iraq, as we have been helping them over the last 4 years, with a tremendous amount of our American blood and treasure. We have much invested in Iraq. America has strategic interests in the Middle East. And we will continue to help the people of Iraq, as we will continue to protect our interests and those of our allies in the Middle East. But the future of Iraq, however, will be determined by the Iraqi people. The future of Iraq will be determined by a political accommodation by the people in Iraq, which will result in a political resolution that will be supported by the Iraqi people, its regional neighbors, and other powers, including the United States. After 4 years in Iraq, America 's pol- icy there should be designed to gradu-ally pull the United States further away from the day-to-day responsibil-ities, those day-to-day responsibilities of defending Iraq and de facto govern-ance of Iraq, and turning over those re-sponsibilities to the Iraqis, not esca-lating \u2014not escalating \u2014our military involvement in Iraq. Today, we are headed in the opposite direction. I will not support sustaining a flawed and failing policy in Iraq. We are now in our fifth year in an ac- tive war in Iraq. Iraq is more dan-gerous today than at any time in the last 4 years. And \u2014puzzling \u2014the admin- istration says, we are making real progress in Iraq. So if we are making VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3806 March 27, 2007 real progress in Iraq, then why are we putting more and more American com-bat troops into Iraq at the same time our allies are leaving or have already left? The President 's strategy is taking America deeper and deeper into this quagmire, with no exit strategy. In January, we were told that 21,500 more U.S. troops would be sent to Iraq. This month, we learned that as many as 7,000 more U.S. troops, in addition to the 21,500, would be sent to Iraq. The Congressional Budget Office has esti-mated that the President 's recent deci- sion to escalate our military involve-ment could require as many as 48,000 additional U.S. troops in Iraq. In January, the administration said progress on the Iraq war would be measurable by this summer. We have heard that at 6-month intervals for the last 2 years in oversight committee hearings. But now we are being told that additional troops could be re-quired in Iraq well into next year. This strategy to deepen America 's military involvement in Iraq will not bring a resolution in Iraq. It will only continue to undermine America 's standing in Iraq and the Middle East, complicating and limiting our diplo-matic options, and doing further dam-age to our military. And we continue to finance and build the most powerful and unaccountable mercenary armies in history, like Blackwater. We cannot continue down a path that is destroying our military and con-tinuing to place our men and women in uniform in Iraq in the middle of a civil war. In February, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace, reported to Congress that there is now \u2014his word \u2014a ''significant '' risk that our military will not be able to re-spond to an emerging crisis in another part of the world. Why did he say that? It is because we are overburdened, overstretched. We are breaking our force structure \u2014third and fourth tours. Recently, the inspector general of the Defense Department issued a report on our National Guard. Our National Guard \u2014our Army National Guard in America is broken. The Chief of Staff of the Army, General Schoomaker, has made similar, recent comments in open testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. It is now time for the Congress to step forward and establish responsible boundaries and conditions for our con-tinued military involvement in Iraq. That is our responsibility. Need I re-mind our colleagues in this body, the Congress of the United States is a co-equal branch of Government with the President of the United States? We not only have moral obligations but we have constitutional responsibilities. To hear some of my colleagues say we should dispense with this ''frivo- lous'' debate because the President has threatened a veto \u2014what a waste of our time\u2014if you logically follow that through, why do we need a Congress? Why don 't we let the President make all the choices, make all the decisions? There are some, I suspect, in this ad-ministration who would like that, some in this country would like that. But we tried a monarchy once. It is not suited to America. There are separa-tions of power. Of course there are. But there are three coequal branches of Government. It is now time for the Congress to step forward, after a disastrous 4 years in Iraq. The language in the Senate supplemental bill does this in a respon-sible way. The Senate language does not cut off funds. It does not impose a precipitous withdrawal of troops from Iraq. This language establishes a lim-ited U.S. military mission in Iraq: counterterrorism, training Iraqi forces, and protecting U.S. personnel. That is not new. We have heard that from this administration over the last 4 years. This was not dreamed up. This idea that somehow you do not support the troops if you do not continue, in a lem-ming-like way, to accept whatever this administration 's policy is wrong. That is what is wrong, and that is dan-gerous. This language establishes a limited U.S. military mission in Iraq that fo-cuses on the things we should be doing, we can be doing. This new and respon-sible mission would pull our troops out of the middle of Iraq 's civil war. Is that wrong? Is there something wrong with that\u2014asking these young men and women to put their lives on the line in the middle of a civil war in Baghdad, kicking down doors, with a bull 's eye on their back \u2014to pull them out of that? Is that wrong? Does that some-how display a cavalier attitude toward the support of our troops? I think not. I think just the opposite. There is a timeline in the Senate lan- guage. But it does not establish a bind-ing date for U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Let's get that clear. It would establish the goal \u2014those are the terms, goal \u2014a goal that U.S. forces not involved in this more limited military mission be redeployed by March 2008. Is there something wrong with that? That means March of 2008 is 5 years we will have been there \u20145 years. We will have done significant damage to our Marines and our Army and our National Guard by then. We have misunderstood, misread, misplanned, and mismanaged our hon-orable intentions in Iraq with an arro-gant self-delusion reminiscent of Viet-nam. Honorable intentions are not policies or plans or responsible. It may take many years before there is a cohe-sive political center in Iraq. America 's options on this point have always been limited. I support the President 's decision to initiate a new diplomatic strategy and support a regional diplomatic process on the future of Iraq that began on March 10 at the regional security con-ference in Baghdad. But the President must devote his attention to foster those efforts. As the Baker-Hamilton report made clear, we must develop a regional diplomatic strategy to achieve stability in Iraq. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's time has expired. Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask for 60 seconds to conclude my remarks. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 60 seconds. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HAGEL. America finds itself in a dangerous and isolated position in the world. We are perceived as a nation at war with Muslims. This debilitating and dangerous perception must be re-versed as the world seeks a new center of gravity for this new century. The United States must begin planning for a phased troop withdrawal from Iraq. The cost of combat in Iraq in terms of American lives, dollars, and world standing has been devastating for our country. The American people are demanding that we develop a bipartisan consensus for an honorable and responsible exit strategy from Iraq. If we fail to build a bipartisan foundation for an exit strat-egy, America will pay a high price for this blunder \u2014one we will have dif- ficulty recovering from in the years ahead. Our actions today in the Congress begin this effort. Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield to the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, Mr. T HUNE , 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for yield-ing. I rise in support of his amendment and also note that Friday of last week, March 23, was, in my view, a sad day because it was on that day the House of Representatives voted to usurp the re-sponsibilities of the President of the United States as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Unfortunately, the Democratic majority in the Senate, rather than reject this ill-conceived and dangerous line of thinking, has chosen to endorse it. I believe the phased redeployment language in the supplemental is wrong. Today, I ask my colleagues to stop and think about the long-term effects the redeployment language is going to have. This language will do more than redeploy troops. It will set a precedent that Congress may interject itself into the military chain of command. This is not a slippery slope, it is a straight drop to the bottom. War requires one Commander in Chief. Every civilization, from Greece to the British Empire, has understood this basic premise, as did our Founders. Wars are unpredictable, and they are fluid. Success in any military conflict requires energy, speed, flexibility, and VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, 27, 2007 adaptability. I thought the Senate un- derstood this, particularly when we unanimously confirmed General Petraeus to be the commander of forces in Iraq. What are our commanders in the field supposed to think? What orders are they to comply with? Are they going to conduct the surge or are they going to reorganize their forces to com-ply with redeploying the troops? Should we expect our commanders to read their operations orders or congres-sional conference reports to determine their priorities? This effort, led by the Democratic majority, is simply a bad idea, and I hope my colleagues can see that the short-term gain they seek on this bill will lead to long-term consequences for the military. The other reason I oppose the rede- ployment language is it confuses stra-tegic policy with foreign policy. Both have the same goal: victory in Iraq and to bring our troops home. However, that goal is arrived at by very different means. Our strategic policy is set by the President and by our military com-manders. Conversely, our foreign pol-icy is set by their diplomatic counter-parts at the State Department. That is why interagency cooperation is impor-tant now more than ever. In order for the U.S. Government to effectively em-ploy the elements of the national power, Congress must resist the temp-tation to intervene and ultimately make matters worse. Redeploying our troops from Iraq on a published timeline is not going to end the war on terrorism. To me, the rede-ployment language in this bill is the strategic equivalent of the Maginot line. In World War II, the French built a wall and the Germans went around it. If we publish our deployment timeline, then Shia and Sunni insurgents, al- Qaida in Iraq, and Iranian instigators will all simply wait for us to leave and then begin their efforts to undo all we have worked for over the past 4 to 5 years. The conflict we are fighting today is unlike any other we have fought. That is why I find the Democratic talking points about how the war in Iraq has lasted longer than this conflict or that conflict to be so disingenuous. They are right on one point: This is not World War II. It is not Vietnam. It is Iraq. It is the war on terror, and our ef-forts in Iraq cannot be looked at in a vacuum. Iraq is a front in the war on terror, but it is not the front in the war on terror, because this war has no front. If you want to know where the front is in the war on terror, then get in your car and drive 10 minutes over to the Pen-tagon. That is a front. Go to New York and look at the gaping holes in the ground. That is a front. Or visit the field in Pennsylvania where a group of brave passengers forced a plane to the ground at the expense of their own lives. That is a front. If any of my col-leagues are still wondering where the front is on the war on terror, you are standing on it. In order to deal with this phe- nomenon, in almost every sector of U.S. security policy we are trying to push America 's enemies further away. Port security is a perfect example. We are putting inspectors in foreign ports to inspect cargo before it comes to the United States, and we are allowing the Coast Guard to inspect ships further out at sea, all for the purpose of put-ting the enemy farther away from us. Yet in this instance, this bill seems to invite our enemies into the very heart of our country. To me, it simply does not make sense. Our colleagues on the other side also like to note there were no Iraqis on the planes that attacked us on September 11. Well, there weren 't any Afghanis ei- ther. In fact, if we follow this line of thinking to its logical conclusion about who was on those planes, then perhaps this Congress should change the 2002 authorization for the use of force and allow the President to attack Saudi Arabia, because the majority of the hijackers were Saudis. Of course, such a line of thinking is ridiculous because this conflict is not about national identity, it is about ide-ology. It is about good versus evil, right versus wrong, freedom versus tyr-anny, and hope versus cynicism. I will concede this administration has not handled Iraq as well as it could have, but I also believe this debate is more about our national identity or re-solve than our involvement in Iraq. I still believe that America, for all its faults, is a shining city on a hill, that our greatest export should be free-dom and our greatest asset being peo-ple and ideas; that we are a beacon of hope to those who toil in the darkness of tyranny and oppression. I also be-lieve if we pass this legislation, we are saying to the world the United States is committed to defending freedom only when it is convenient or popular. That is not the America I know. It is not the America my father, a World War II fighter pilot, taught me about or the country we should hope to be-come. It is my sincere hope my colleagues will vote to support Senator C OCHRAN 's amendment to remove the troop with-drawal language from this bill. If we do not, I believe we will be doing more harm than good, despite the intentions to the contrary. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Illinois is recognized. Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we gath- er on another occasion to bring the Iraq war to its fateful end. While this effort may fall short again, we will continue to try to do what is in the na-tional security of our country. The Iraq war should never have been authorized. I was proud to say so in 2002, but I am even more proud of the plan I have offered that calls for com-bat to begin redeploying on May 1 with the goal of all combat troops out of Iraq by March 2008. We also must make sure that we are not as careless getting out of this war as we were getting in, and that is why this withdrawal should be gradual, and keep some U.S. troops in the region to prevent a wider war in the region and go after al-Qaida and other terrorists. Those who would have us continue this war in perpetuity like to say that this is a matter of resolve on behalf of the American people. But the Amer-ican people have been extraordinarily resolved. They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded on the streets of Fallujah. They have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort \u2014money that could have been de- voted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation. No, it has not been a failure of re- solve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy \u2014a strategy that has only strengthened Iran 's strategic position; increased threats posed by terrorist organizations; reduced U.S. credibility and influence around the world; and placed Israel and other na-tions friendly to the United States in the region in greater peril. Iraq has been a failure of strategy and that strategy must change. It is time to bring a responsible end to this conflict because there is no military solution to this war. Before we send our best off to battle in the future, we must remember what led us to this day and learn from the principles that follow. We must remember that ideology is not a foreign policy. We must not em-bark on war based on untested theo-ries, political agendas or wishful think-ing that have little basis in fact or re-ality. We must focus our efforts on the threats we know exist, and we must evaluate those threats with sound in-telligence that is never manipulated for political reasons again. We must remember that the cost of going it alone is immense. It is a choice we sometimes have to make, but one that must be made rarely and al-ways reluctantly. We must remember that planning for peace is just as critical as planning for war. Iraq was not just a failure of con-ception, but a failure of execution. So when a conflict does arise that requires our involvement, we must try to under-stand that country 's history, its poli- tics, its ethnic and religious divisions before our troops ever set foot on its soil. We must understand that setting up ballot boxes does not automatically create a democracy. Real freedom and real stability come from doing the hard work of helping to build a strong police force, and a legitimate government, and ensuring that people have food, and water, and electricity, and basic services. And we must be honest about VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3808 March 27, 2007 how much of that we can do ourselves and how much must come from the people themselves. And finally, we must remember that when we send our service men and women to war, we make sure we have given them the training they need, and the equipment that will keep them safe, and a mission they can accom-plish. And when our troops come home, it is our most solemn responsibility to make sure they come home to the serv-ices, and the benefits, and the care they deserve. The cause to defend our country and our interests around the world will never end. It will be one of our coun-try's constant threads through the ages. It is our sacred trust to ensure that those moments, those times of great struggle, are the right ones. And when they are not, we must continue to try and end those conflicts for the sake of our country, our service men and women, and the ideals we hold dear. For these reasons, I strongly support the provision in the supplemental bill that calls for the withdrawal of Amer-ican combat troops by March 31, 2008, and I will oppose any efforts to strip that provision from the bill. Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we have arrived at a key moment for U.S. policy in Iraq. History recalls Oper-ations Desert Shield and Storm in 1990 and 1991. It recalls the no-fly zones we maintained in the 1990s. It recalls the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. It recalls our sanctions against Saddam Hussein. And when history records Operation Iraqi Freedom, it will remember whether Congress provided the direc-tion necessary to complete the mission or chose to cut it off prematurely. His-tory win judge today 's vote. The American people await this vote. The Iraqi people await this vote. Al- Qaida awaits this vote. The surge is now underway. I did not support the surge, but I hope it works. The first re-ports have been encouraging, but the fog of war remains thick. Over the next few months, we will be able to assess whether the surge is working or not. Now is hardly the time to set a date for retreat. I am not saying we should have an open-ended commitment, but I am say-ing that our mission over there \u2014and not politics over here \u2014should drive our policy. I know many of my colleagues believe we have nothing to gain by staying. But I believe there is a way forward. Everyone agrees that a political solu- tion is crucial to success. And it turns out that the political solution Iraqis ought to pursue is the most American of all: Federalism. Thankfully, in the early days in America, we did not have the kind of factional violence and terrorism we have seen in Iraq. But it certainly in-cluded rivalries between the colonies and different visions of the future. The great solution chosen by the founding fathers was federalism \u2014some-thing embodied by the Senate itself. An Iraq with several federal regions, with Baghdad as a federal capital rep-resents the best chance for Iraq to achieve stability. If the surge works, federalism can provide the framework necessary to stabilize Iraq over the long term. If the surge fails, and Iraq 's sectarian vio- lence deepens, a federal Iraq will be the only choice available to separate the warring factions while keeping Iraq from breaking apart \u2014something that we cannot allow to occur in such a vital region. I believe that instead of giving the terrorists a reason to be hopeful and sending mixed signals to our forces in the field, we should be talking about the possibility of a federal Iraq. The Iraqi Constitution calls for it. The Iraqi Parliament passed a law sup-porting it. The Kurdish region proves that it can be successful. Yes, a federal Iraq may require the presence of U.S. forces for some period of time. But as we have seen in Bosnia, our deploy-ments in support of a political solution endorsed by all sides can bring lasting peace and a chance for a brighter fu-ture. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Cochran amend-ment. We need to stop talking about how to retreat and start talking about winning in Iraq. A conversation about a federal Iraq is the best way for the Senate to contribute to success in Iraq. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I op- pose the Republican effort to strike the critical section of this bill requiring our troops in Iraq to begin to come home in 120 days and that we finish the job in 2008. This is a defining moment for our country. The American people are watching, and the world is watching. The issue is clear. Will we stand with our soldiers by ending their misguided mission and beginning to bring them home? Or will we stand with the Presi-dent and keep our soldiers trapped in Iraq's civil war? History will judge us. We can either continue down the President 's perilous path or insist on a new direction. If we don't change course, we know what lies ahead \u2014more American casualties, more deaths, more destruction, greater loss of respect for America in the wider world, and greater danger to our na-tional security. A new strategy that makes Iraqis less reliant on our mili-tary is the best way forward. More of the same misguided policy will result in more of the same tragedy for our military. We need a realistic strategy, and we need it now. Iraq is the overarching issue of our time. Our national security itself is at stake. In this debate, we hear echoes of the past: We are accused of cutting and running. We are accused of giving com-fort to the enemy. We are told we need to be patient and to accept the impor-tance of staying the course. We are told we have to give the latest esca-lation a chance to succeed. Listen to this comment from a high- ranking American official: It became clear that if we were prepared to stay the course, we could help to lay the cor-nerstone for a diverse and independent Asia . . . If we faltered, the forces of chaos would scent victory and decades of strife and ag-gression would stretch endlessly before us. The choice was clear. We would stay the course. And we shall stay the course. That is not President Bush speaking. It is President Lyndon Johnson 40 years ago, ordering a 100,000 more American soldiers to Vietnam. Here is another quotation: The big problem is to get territory and to keep it. You can get it today and it will be gone next week. That is the problem. You have to have enough people to clear it . . . and enough people to preserve what you have done. That is not President Bush on the need for more forces in Iraq. It is Presi-dent Johnson in 1966 as he doubled our military presence in Vietnam. Here is yet another familiar argu- ment. We are not going to tuck our tail and run ... Those are not President Bush 's words. Those are the words of Presi-dent Johnson in 1966. Here is another familiar argument: We are being steadfast in Vietnam because we don 't want the next generation of Ameri- cans to have to fight another war. That is not President Bush, but it sure sounds like him. It is Vice Presi-dent Agnew in December 1969. Here is another familiar argument being used in the Iraq debate by the stay-the-course Republicans that we 've heard before: We think we can bring peace. We will bring peace. The peace that we will be able to achieve will be due to the fact that Ameri-cans, when it really counted, did not buckle, did not run away, but stood fast . . . That is not President Bush. It is President Nixon in September 1969. And here is another: If, when the chips are down, the world 's most powerful nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institu-tions throughout the world. That 's not President Bush. Those are the words of President Nixon in April of 1970. These words from the past resonate painfully in today 's debate on Iraq. In Vietnam, the White House grew in-creasingly obsessed with victory, and increasingly divorced from the will of the people and any rational policy. The Department of Defense kept assuring us that each new escalation in Vietnam would be the last. We were told to be steadfast, to stay the course, and not to retreat. There was no military solu-tion to that war. But we kept trying to find one anyway. In the end, 58,000 Americans died in the search for it. Echoes of that disaster are all around us today. Iraq is George Bush 's Viet- nam. But we have heard all that in the current debate about Iraq as well. We VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3809 March 27, 2007 have heard for years that the adminis- tration has a plan for success, that progress is just around the corner. But the plans for success keep getting tossed aside for new plans. The admin-istration has benchmarks to measure success, but there are no consequences when the benchmarks are not met. The timelines for progress keep getting ex-tended. We have turned so many cor-ners that we have ended up back where we started \u2014trying to control Baghdad. It is time to change direction. Mr. President, 3,200 members of our forces have been killed, and more than 24,000 have been wounded. The casualties keep mounting. The violence continues to spiral upward. Our troops are in the impossible position of trying to sta-bilize a country at war with itself. The recent National Intelligence Es- timate confirms the nightmare sce-nario unfolding for our troops. Iraq is sliding deeper into the abyss of civil war, and our brave men and women are caught in the middle of it. Prospects for halting the sectarian violence are bleak. Greater chaos and anarchy are loom- ing ahead. Needless additional U.S. causalities are inevitable. The facts speak for themselves. Ac- cording to the United Nations, nearly 35,000 civilians were violently killed in Iraq last year. Most were killed in Baghdad, where ''unidentified bodies killed execution-style are found in large numbers daily. '' More than 2 million refugees have fled the violence in Iraq, and another 1.8 million have been displaced inter-nally. Our military should not be caught in the middle of this quagmire. Only a po-litical solution can solve Iraq 's prob- lems. General Casey, in his testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in June 2005, called for a political solu-tion. He said: If you look back historically at how insurgencies have been defeated, they have been defeated when the insurgents saw their options as better protected in the political process and their prospects for economic ad-vancement can be better protected by the po-litical process than fighting for them. And that's the essential element here. Last August, General Abizaid spoke about the need for a political solution. He said: Our troops are the best equipped, the best trained, the best led in the world. And I am enormously proud of them, and I have the utmost confidence in their ability to handle any mission. Yet, sectarian violence is worse than ever in Baghdad in particular. And I wonder about the validity of a strategy that says that less capable troops that are not as well equipped, trained and led as the best troops in the world can handle the security of this country if the upswing in violence has occurred despite the presence of the best troops in the world. It doesn 't give me a lot of confidence in our underlying strategy. And it suggests to me that what we need is a political rather than a military solution. General Petraeus, the new com- mander of our forces in Iraq, recently emphasized as well that there is ''no military solution '' in Iraq. But no one in the administration has been able to clearly articulate a political solution or how it can take hold in the midst of this chaos. Instead of giving the Iraqis a nec- essary incentive to get their political house in order by beginning an orderly redeployment of our troops out of Iraq, the President stubbornly insists on sending more and more American troops into Iraq 's civil war. Escalation didn't work in Vietnam and it won 't work in Iraq either. Even worse, the administration has not been honest about the number of troops the President plans to send to Iraq for the surge. On January 10, he announced that he had committed ''more than 20,000 '' ad- ditional troops to Iraq. Within a few days, we were told the number was 21,500. The Congressional Budget Office esti- mated that it would be far higher as much as 35,000 to 48,000 troops when support troops are included. On February 6, I asked General Pace and Secretary Gates for the best mili-tary estimate as to the actual size of the escalation. Their answer was an ad-ditional 10 to 15 percent. General Pace said, ''you're going to need no more than another 2,000, 2,500 troops on the ground. '' Nine days later, the number more than doubled. General Schoomaker told the Armed Services Committee his estimate was somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 troops when he included imbedded trainers. Then, on March 6 Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England told a House committee ''about 4,000, maybe as many as 7,000. '' On March 7, at the request of General Petraeus, Secretary Gates authorized an additional 2,200 military police troops. We still don 't have an accurate total for the size of this escalation. The ad-ministration refuses to speak with clarity and candor. Since the current surge began, Shiite militias in Baghdad may be lying low, but violence has increased elsewhere in Iraq. In Diyala province, in just 3 months, American casualties have exceeded the number for the entire year of 2006. In January this year, 83 American soldiers were killed, compared to 62 in the same month a year ago. Eighty more American soldiers were killed in February this year. In the same month last year, we lost 55 sol-diers. In March, we have already lost 76 sol- diers, compared to 31 in March 2006. Continuing our open-ended commit- ment to stay in Iraq will not bring vic-tory. It will not stop the violence, and it will not protect our national secu-rity. The administration has outlined military, economic, and political benchmarks to measure success. But it has not given any timeline to achieve them, and it has not specified any con-sequences if the benchmarks are not met. This same administration supported timelines for every Iraqi election and for drafting the constitution. Yet it re-mains emphatically opposed to any timeline for the redeployment of our military. The American people have been pa- tient. But America has now been in Iraq longer than it took us to win World War II. Instead of progress, we continue to see unacceptably high lev-els of violence, death, and destruction. We are putting too much strain on our Army, especially the Army Na-tional Guard. Our forces are over-extended. Many soldiers are now on their third rotation. In the long run, we can 't protect our Army if we don 't end the war. Our troops have done their part. They have served with great courage. We are proud of their service, and we are ready to welcome them home. It is time to change course. It is time to insist that Iraqis step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future. It is time to begin to rede-ploy our troops out of Iraq. It is time to put the Iraqis on notice that our military will no longer be a permanent crutch for them to lean on and avoid their responsibility to achieve a polit-ical solution. As General Abizaid told the Armed Services Committee last November: I believe that more American forces pre- vent the Iraqis from doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own future. The only practical way to accomplish the change that is long overdue is for American combat troops to begin to come home. Those of us who opposed the war are used to the administration 's attacks when we disagree with their wrong-headed policy. We have come to expect that. They have questioned our patriotism and called us defeatists. When we challenged the President 's misguided policy, they accused us of having political motives and being par-tisan. But all of their criticisms have a hollow ring, because the administra-tion has been so consistently wrong about the war in Iraq. They were wrong about the link be- tween al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein. They were wrong about Saddam Hus- sein's possession of weapons of mass destruction. They were wrong about America being greeted as liberators. They were wrong about the insurgency being in its last throes. And they are wrong to deny that Iraq is in a civil war. The American people are far ahead of the administration. For all of us who oppose this misguided war, our goals have always been clear: to pro-tect the lives of our soldiers and to pro-tect our national security. We have an obligation to stand up for our troops and stand up to our Presi-dent when he stubbornly refuses to change course in Iraq. This legislation will do that. It will change the mission of our military away from combat and require the VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, 27, 2007 President to begin to redeploy Amer- ican combat troops out of Iraq in 4 months. The target date for the com-pletion of the redeployment is March 2008, 1 year from now. A limited num-ber of troops would remain in Iraq after that, to train and equip the Iraqi Security Forces, to conduct counter- terrorism operations, and to guarantee the safety of our soldiers. Legislation is clearly necessary to give the Iraqi Government enough in-centive to step up to the plate, work out its political differences, and take responsibility for Iraq 's future. Our proposal is consistent with the bipartisan Iraq Study Group 's findings. It is also consistent with the wishes of the American people, who want most of our troops home within a year. How much clearer does it have to be before Republicans in Congress and the Presi-dent finally respond to the voices of the American people? We are meeting our responsibilities by changing the mission of our military. We are not micromanaging the war. Many of us oppose the war, but all of us support our troops. We don 't want to keep sending more and more of them into the middle of a civil war. Under no circumstances do we want them to go to war without proper armor and equipment. Our troops deserve better. Their families and loved ones deserve better. For the sake of our men and women in uniform in Iraq and the American people, it is time for us to take a stand. We need to adopt a new strategy. We need to make clear to the Iraqi Govern-ment that the mission of our troops must change and that we have a clear timeframe for their departure from Iraq. The Senate will fail our troops unless we vote to change course and begin to bring our soldiers home. At the end of this debate, the Amer- ican people will know where each of us stands. On our side of the aisle, we stand with the American people. The voters told us in November to change course and begin to bring our troops home, and that is what we want to do. We stand with our troops. We and we alone are the ones insisting on a policy worthy of their courage and sacrifice. We stand for protecting America 's national security. The war in Iraq has been a disaster from the start. It has made America more hated in the world. It has made it harder to win the war against terrorism. It has made it hard-er to work with other nations on every issue. Peace and progress in Iraq must be earned by Iraqis and their neighbors. We must no longer send our brave soldiers to an uncertain fate on the streets of Baghdad. We must begin to bring them home, to the hero 's welcome they have surely earned. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Cochran amend-ment, which would strike language in the bill that takes a significant step toward ending our involvement in the war in Iraq. The language I am referring to won the support of 48 Senators just a few weeks ago. I voted for it then and will vote to retain it today. While it does not go as far or as fast as I would like, it would effectively end the President 's misguided policies in Iraq by termi-nating, within 120 days, the current open-ended military mission in Iraq. At that point, U.S. troops could remain in Iraq for three specified, narrow pur-poses. The remainder of our troops would be redeployed. This provision is binding and it would bring to an end our current involvement in perhaps the greatest foreign policy mistake in our country 's history. Some of my colleagues continue to argue that Congress should defer to the Commander in Chief when it comes to Iraq, that we should give him the op-portunity to change course in Iraq, or that we should allow his escalation plan the chance to succeed. Those ar-guments ignore our congressional re-sponsibilities. Congress authorized this war and it is in our power to bring it to a close. More importantly, we have not just the power but the responsibility to end a war that is draining vital na-tional security resources in pursuit of a goal that cannot be achieved mili-tarily. The political problems that are driving much of the insurgency and sectarian strife in Iraq are tragic and important. They require the attention of U.S. policymakers. They do not re-quire in fact, they cannot be solved by a massive and indefinite U.S. military presence in Iraq. Our troops continue to perform heroically in Iraq but there is no military solution to Iraq 's prob- lems. Some of my colleagues raise the specter of dire consequences if we rede-ploy U.S. forces from Iraq. That is pre-cisely why we need a strategic ap-proach to redeployment, one that ad-dresses ongoing instability and other threats with our intelligence, diplo-matic, economic and, in a limited man-ner, military capabilities. Not only is the continuation of this war not going to end sectarian and insurgent vio-lence, it puts off the day when we de-velop a comprehensive strategy for Iraq that is sustainable and fits square-ly within the larger struggle of fight-ing al-Qaida. As long as the President 's policies continue, our troops will continue to put their lives on the line, our con-stituents will continue putting billions of their dollars into this war, our mili-tary readiness will continue to erode, our Guard and Reserve members will continue to face heavy burdens, and our ability to respond to an array of national security challenges will con-tinue to suffer. From Somalia to Af-ghanistan to the ongoing fight against al-Qaida, we face threats and chal-lenges that require serious attention and resources. Right now, far too much of both are being spent on a single country. It is this single-minded and self-defeating policy that needs to end, and it is up to Congress to do so. Time and again, the President has made it clear that nothing not the wishes of the American people, not the advice of military and foreign policy experts, not the concerns of members of both parties will dissuade him from pursuing policies in Iraq that are not working. Faced with a clear mandate from the voters last November, he stalled for time, before announcing not just a continuation but an escalation of his policies. Congress cannot wait for the President to change course we need to change the course ourselves. The provision that Senator C OCHRAN seeks to strike represents a change of course. It requires redeployment of our troops while recognizing that the U.S. has an ongoing role to play in address-ing the terrorist threat in Iraq. While Iraq was not a hot-bed of terrorism be-fore the President led us to war in that country, al-Qaida and its allies are try-ing to use the anger and frustrations unleashed by that war to their advan- tage. Like Afghanistan and Somalia, Iraq will need to be closely monitored to ensure that it does not become a failed state and breeding ground for terrorism. And we must be prepared to pursue targeted missions to take out terrorists. But maintaining 140,000 U.S. troops in Iraq is not the way to defeat al-Qaida. And military operations of any size will only succeed if they are combined with other measures includ-ing diplomatic, economic and intel-ligence measures as part of a com-prehensive strategy for defeating the terrorists who threaten our country. Al-Qaida is not a one-country franchise it is a global threat that requires a global response. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address the amendment offered by Senator C OCH- RAN. The Senate finds itself in the same position it was in just 2 weeks ago, when it considered an amendment offered by the majority leader, Senator R EID. Senate amendment No. 643, of- fered by the Senior Senator from Mis-sissippi, who is the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, would strike the language that is essentially that of S. J. Res. 9, which the Senate rejected on March 15, 2007. I draw to the attention of my colleagues my statement in the R ECORD of March 15, 2007, at page 53166. As I stated 2 weeks ago, I would be prepared to cross party lines, as I have done in the past when I thought it war-ranted, if I agreed with the thrust of the resolution. Seven Senators of the minority joined with the majority in voting for cloture several weeks ago to move ahead with the debate and try to come to a resolution on the Iraqi issue. I was one of the seven. I would not hesitate to do so again if I agreed, but I cannot agree with the language re-quiring that not later than 120 days after enactment to have phased rede-ployment of U.S. forces, with the goal of redeploying by March 31, 2008, all U.S. combat forces in Iraq. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3811 March 27, 2007 The thrust of the language in the bill, however, is to leave Iraq in a year, something that will ensure defeat \u2014as setting a timetable simply enables our opponents to wait us out. I think beyond that, the idea of hav- ing the Congress of the United States micromanage the war is simply not re-alistic, and perhaps it may even be un-lawful. I note in the case of Fleming v. Page, in 1850, the Supreme Court said: As Commander in Chief, he is authorized to direct the movements of the naval and mili-tary forces placed by law at his command, and to employ them in the manner he may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy. That is a fairly forceful statement that it is not up to the Congress to micromanage a war but that it is up to the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States. That is not to say that the Congress does not have au-thority in the premises. I continue to seek hearings by the Judiciary Com-mittee on the relative powers, author-ity of the Congress under the Constitu-tion, with our power of the purse and our power to maintain and direct ar-mies, contrasted with the President 's power as Commander in Chief. I believe, however, it is impractical and of questionable legal authority for us to seek to micromanage the war if the consequences of giving an order to the President would just enable the enemy to wait us out. That is not to say that at sometime in the future it may be necessary, and there may be a considered joint judgment by the Con-gress, to use the extraordinary power of the purse to implement our constitu-tional authority to maintain armies to effectuate a withdrawal. I had one additional thought to the substance of my floor statement of March 15. We may find victory, unex-pectedly, as Winston Churchill said in a June 18, 1940 speech, when he was commenting on World War I: During the first four years of the last war the Allies experienced nothing but disaster and disappointment. That was our constant fear: one blow after another, terrible losses, frightful dangers. Everything miscarried. And yet at the end of those four years the morale of the Allies was higher than that of the Germans, who had moved from one ag-gressive triumph to another, and who stood everywhere triumphant invaders of the lands into which they had broken. During that war we repeatedly asked ourselves the question: How are we going to win? And no one was able ever to answer it with much precision, until at the end, quite suddenly, quite unex-pectedly, our terrible foe collapsed before us, and we were so glutted with victory that in our folly we threw it away. Churchill 's words suggest that if we maintain our determination we can win although the path to victory, at the moment, is very uncertain. Furthermore, the President has issued a veto threat should legislation contain the provision Senator C OCH- RAN's amendment would strike. Such an action would deprive funds vital to U.S. troops and the operations of the Department of Defense. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership and floor management. The Cochran amendment would strike the heart of the provision relat-ing to Iraq from this supplemental ap-propriations bill. The main point of our provision is a requirement that the President commence a reduction of U.S. forces from Iraq not later than 120 days after enactment. Not included in the reduction would be those forces that are essential for force protection, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting targeted counterterrorism operations. This language is essential because nothing else has been successful in con-vincing the Iraqis that they have to take responsibility for their own coun-try and that they must make the polit-ical compromises that are necessary to end the sectarian violence and defeat the insurgency in Iraq. Only when the Iraqis realize the mission of U.S. forces is going to change and that we are going to reduce the number of U.S. forces in Iraq will they realize we can-not save them from themselves, and that they need to act to meet the com-mitments they made to themselves and to us. Commitments are only words unless they are fulfilled. Last month, during our debate on Iraq, I put in the R ECORD Secretary Rice 's letter to me of Janu- ary 2007 which had an enclosure of the listing of the political commitments and the timelines the Iraqis themselves had established. Virtually none of those commitments has been met, de-spite the fact most of them were to have been fulfilled last year, and all but one were to have been accom-plished prior to this month. They com-mitted themselves to approve a provin-cial elections law and they set a date for a provincial elections law by Octo-ber of 2006. They set a date to approve militias and other armed formations by December 2006. They set a date for the constitutional review committee to complete its work by January 2007. They made a commitment to conduct a referendum on constitutional amend-ments which was to have been accom-plished by this month. They violated every single one of those commit-ments. We need to retain this language. We need to retain the language that we begin to reduce the number of Amer-ican forces in Iraq beginning in 4 months because that reduction is the action-forcing mechanism \u2014the sign to the Iraqi leaders we cannot save them from themselves, and their future is in their hands, not our hands. The most graphic demonstration of the importance of our provision is the fact that even our senior leaders in this administration, while opposing our po-sition, have used the growing support for our position to try to impress upon the Iraqi leaders they have to move promptly to settle their differences and to meet their commitments. Last month while in Baghdad, Sec- retary Rice used the restiveness in Washington to emphasize to the Iraqi leaders the growth of American frus-tration with the absence of a political settlement in Iraq. She said she had ''made clear that some of the debate in Washington is indicative of the con-cerns that the American people have about the prospects for success '' if Iraq's leaders do not quickly take the steps needed to ensure longer-term sta-bility. Ambassador Khalilzad, in a television interview on March 9, said the debate in Congress: Sends a message to the Iraqis that the pa- tience of the American people is running out. And\u2014 He said, Ambassador Khalilzad said \u2014 that is helpful to my diplomacy. The Iraqi Study Group said: The open-ended commitment of American forces does not provide the Iraqi government with the incentive that it needs to take po-litical actions that give Iraq the best chance of quelling sectarian violence. In the absence of such an incentive \u2014 The Iraq Study Group said \u2014 in the absence of ending the open-ended com- mitment that has been made to Iraq, the Iraqi government might continue to delay taking those difficult actions. I think perhaps General Casey said it best: The longer U.S. forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraq 's security, it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation in dealing with the militias. General Casey had it right. Let us not sustain the Cochran amendment. Let's keep this critically important ac- tion-forcing mechanism in the bill where it will do some good to force those Iraqi leaders to finally recognize their future is in their hands, not ours. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Mississippi is recognized. Mr. COCHRAN. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Con-necticut, Mr. L IEBERMAN . Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today the Senate approaches a decisive turning point in the history of our en-gagement in Iraq, a moment that will have repercussions not only for the fu-ture of that country but for the secu-rity of our country as well. The immediate question before us is direct. Should Congress impose a dead-line for the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq? To that question I answer: No, no, no. We all know the circumstances under which this vote is taking place. The ad-ministration is politically weak. The war is politically unpopular. It has never been easier to advocate a with-drawal. But I cannot support it because I believe deeply that it would be wrong. Our cause in Iraq remains just and nec-essary, and we continue to have the prospect of achieving success there. If passed, this legislation would order a withdrawal of American troops from Iraq to begin in 120 days, regardless of conditions on the ground, regardless of whether we are succeeding or failing, regardless of the consequences for VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3812 March 27, 2007 America 's security, regardless of the consequences for our allies in the re-gion, and regardless of the rec-ommendations of the man we unani-mously put in charge of our troops there \u2014GEN David Petraeus. In short, this withdrawal would be ordered by this legislation regardless of reality. This congressionally ordered with- drawal of our troops from Iraq would essentially be giving up on our cause in Iraq just when our prospects are pick-ing up there. It would snatch defeat from the jaws of progress in Iraq today \u2014progress that is critically im- portant to our success in the larger war against terrorism. What then are the arguments given to justify such an arbitrary order to our troops from this Congress so far away? First, proponents of withdrawal keep returning to the proposition that American soldiers shouldn 't be policing a civil war. Surely my colleagues don 't mean to say the U.S. military has never or should never police a civil war. That would certainly come as a surprise to our soldiers who have been keeping the peace in Bosnia and Kosovo over the past decade, dis-patched there wisely and strongly under a Democratic President with the support of Democrats in Congress. Clearly, our military has policed civil wars in the past and will do so and must do so in the future. So why do proponents of withdrawal from Iraq keep insisting it shouldn 't happen now? The answer has to do with the way some people choose to characterize what is happening in Iraq. When they suggest our soldiers are stuck in a civil war there, it suggests the conflict has become hopeless, a pit of violence where there are no heroes, only villains, and where our military cannot possibly do any good. Is this the case? I think the facts suggest not. There are more heroes by far than vil-lains in Iraq today and, most of all, there is the overwhelming majority of the Iraqi people who are the innocent victims of violence and want nothing more than to live secure and free lives. Iraq has a government \u2014a govern- ment freely elected by the people; a government where every day Iraqis of every ethnicity and sectarian identity come together. That is not a civil war. The Iraqi Government has faults and weaknesses, to be sure, and we should be using every instrument at our dis-posal to pressure its leaders to make better choices. But there is a world of difference between the moderates who compose the Iraqi Government and the extremists who seek to murder them. The image of Iraq as a country in which everyone is complicit in the vio-lence also overlooks something else. It overlooks the innocent victims of that violence who are the majority. The truth is we are confronted in Iraq today with a deliberated, calculated campaign of murder of civilians, often on the basis of religious identity alone, by insurgents and terrorists. All of us should be able to unite around the proposition, therefore, that we as Americans have a moral respon-sibility not to pick up and walk away and turn our backs on the slaughter. Like the Serb death squads that tried to ethnically cleanse Kosovo or Hutu extremists in Rwanda, or the jingaweit today in Darfur, the sectarian violence we are witnessing in Iraq is directed at the extermination of human beings on the basis of nothing more than who they are. It is an awful irony of this debate that many of the same people who con-sistently and correctly call on the United States to do more to stop the genocide in Darfur now demand we abandon the Iraqis and invite a geno-cide there. I know some believe the violence in Iraq is inevitable, the outgrowth of an-cient hatreds that exist outside the bounds of normal politics. We heard those arguments before also. We heard them in the 1990s about Yugoslavia and about Rwanda. Surely, from those con-flicts, we should know better than that now. The wanton slaughter of innocent people that our soldiers are trying to stop in Baghdad, and now with some success, is not the inevitable product of ancient hatreds but the consequence of a deliberate, calculated strategy by an identifiable group of perpetrators, first and foremost al-Qaida. We know this because al-Qaida itself has said so. Its leaders have stated openly that they have worked to foment hatred, fear, and violence between Sunnis and Shi-ites, precisely because al-Qaida knows it represents their best opportunity to overthrow the elected Iraqi Govern-ment, to sow the seeds of chaos, to stamp out any hope of Middle Eastern democracy, and, sadly, as this debate shows today, to push the United States of America \u2014the world 's superpower, the embodiment of the hopes and dreams of so many for freedom \u2014to the point of retreat from Iraq. This is also why the notion expressed in the supplemental that we can sepa-rate the fight against terrorism from the fight against sectarian violence in Iraq simply defies reality. The fact is, the worst sectarian violence in Iraq is being committed by al-Qaida and other Islamist terrorists. The biggest cause of the violence in Iraq is not the split between the Sunnis and Shiites but a specific ideology \u2014the ideology of Islamic extremism \u2014that is trying to exploit that divide for its own evil ends. The success of that ideology is not inevitable. Thanks to General Petraeus, his troops, and the new strat-egy, sectarian violence is down. Maqtada al-Sadr has disappeared. The Mahdi army is splintering. Displaced Iraqi families are returning to their homes. Of course, we will not know for some time to what extent the new strategy will succeed, but it is clear that, for the first time in a long time, there is reason for cautious optimism about Iraq. Why would we, at this moment, order a withdrawal of the very troops that are bringing greater security and a cause for optimism? Mr. President, the record of the past 2 months shows Prime Minister Maliki has allowed and encouraged U.S. forces to sweep into Sadr City. He has worked with General Petraeus to ensure that all of the Iraqi Army units required by the new strategy are available. He has flown to the heart of Al Anbar Prov-ince to meet with Sunni leaders. These breakthroughs have happened not in spite of but because of the American commitment to Iraq and because of the presence of General Petraeus and his troops. I ask my colleagues to consider what it will mean if Congress now orders our troops to pull back from this battle, just at the moment that they are be-ginning to succeed. Consider the con-sequences if we knowingly and will-ingly withdraw our forces and abandon one of the few states in the Middle East to have had free, competitive elections as an alternative to extremism and vio-lence. I understand the frustration and anger and sheer sense of exhaustion so many feel about Iraq. I am acutely aware of the enormous toll this war has taken. But I ask those determined to order a withdrawal to think care-fully about the consequences, and not just geopolitical but moral, for the United States. We cannot redeploy from our moral responsibility in Iraq or in our foreign policy, more gen-erally. It is contrary to our traditions. It is contrary to our values. It is con-trary to our interests. Yet that is pre-cisely what this Congress will be call-ing for if we order our troops to with-draw now. That is precisely what the Congress will be calling for if we order our troops to withdraw from Iraq now, regardless of what is happening on the ground. I appeal to my colleagues, don 't do this. Give General Petraeus and his troops a chance to succeed for us in Iraq. Strike this language from this bill. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Washington is recognized. Mrs. MURRAY. How much time re- mains on both sides? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma- jority has 12 12minutes. The Repub- licans have 13 minutes. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 212minutes. We need to change course in Iraq. That is why I support the supplemental bill now before the Senate and oppose the Cochran amendment that is pend-ing. This underlying bill finally sets a new direction for our mission in Iraq. It begins to redeploy our troops, and it helps us refocus our efforts on fighting and winning the war on terror. Mr. President, our troops have done everything we have asked them to do. Now it is time to start bringing them VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3813 March 27, 2007 home. It is time for the Iraqi people and for the Iraqi Government to take responsibility for their own country. We should not be sending more and more Americans into the middle of a civil war. The conflict in Iraq is not going to be solved by military force alone. It is going to require a political solution among Iraqis. So this under-lying bill sets benchmarks for the Iraqi Government on the types of progress that we all agree they ought to be making. They should not be stricken from this by the Cochran amendment. The President wants to commit more American servicemembers to an open- ended conflict. This bill recognizes that we need a new strategy. We need to do what the Iraqi Study Group and what many generals and what the American people have called for. We need to redeploy our troops. The bill says a redeployment should begin with-in 120 days, and it sets the goal of hav-ing most U.S. forces out of Iraq by next March. Importantly, this bill helps us take care of those who are injured fighting for our country. It is time we focused our attention on those men and women who have sacrificed so much, who have come home and have endured the hard-ship we have seen at Walter Reed and other facilities across this country. We need to make sure they get the re-sources they need, and this bill does that. I am pleased to support the under- lying bill. I oppose the Cochran amend-ment, and I support this bill because it sets a new direction for our policy in Iraq and it provides important new support for our servicemembers and veterans who are here at home. I retain the remainder of our time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Mississippi is recognized. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Vir-ginia, Mr. W ARNER . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Virginia is recognized. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my long-term friend, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. We came to the Senate together some 29 years ago. I commend him for the leadership he has provided throughout his many years and, particularly, on this coming vote, which is most important \u2014not just to the Senate but to the whole Congress and to the people of the United States and to the world. I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. C OCHRAN . Some many weeks ago, shortly after January 10, when the President an-nounced his new strategy for a surge, I was among those few voices on this side that expressed concern about that initiative. I believed that this Nation had invested so heavily in Iraq, in life, in limb, and an extraordinary amount of money, much of that having been spent on the training of the Iraqi secu-rity forces, and that the time had come for those security forces to bear the brunt of the battle. Our group, having drawn up a resolution, endeavored to try to get it debated, but the record shows that opportunity, and the oppor-tunity to vote on it, was not given. But that is history. At this time, however, I believe the operations of our troops under the new strategy are well underway. We have many men and women of our Armed Forces in harm 's way, and we must be very cautious as to the message we send at this time. Mr. President, I say most respect- fully that with this current draft we are trying to strike out the language that, if allowed to stand, would send a sound all over the world. It would be the bugle of retreat; it would be echoed and repeated from every minaret throughout Iraq: The coalition forces have decided to take the first step backward. We cannot send that message at this time. I will be among those who will constantly challenge any aspect of the policies of this administration which I believe are not in the best interest. I have two amendments that, hopefully, will be considered in the context of the pending bill. One calls for an inde-pendent investigation \u2014independent of the Department of Defense and all enti-ties of the Federal Government \u2014of the Iraqi security forces, principally the army and, to some extent, the police, to determine what the status is of those forces today. What has been the result of the bil- lions of dollars we have expended over 2 12years to train and equip them? Are they now, or in the immediate future, able to carry the burden of this fight to enable the people and the Government of Iraq to have greater security and eventually achieve the goals and the full reins of a democracy? The other amendment I have calls for a table of benchmarks and a reporting sequence from our administration as to whether the Iraqis are or are not meet-ing those benchmarks because any op-tion laid down is dependent on the ca-pability of the Iraqi security forces. Early reports in the engagements thus far indicate that, in some measures, they have met the commitments they made to have sent battalions, to have engaged with such limited aggression that has been brought against them in the course of this surge and against the coalition forces. Nevertheless, it is the American forces that are primarily in the lead, primarily in the support role and carrying the greater burden of this battle. So at this time I do not think it is wise to sound that bugle, that sound of retreat. Think of the consequences if that nation implodes and fractures and the Government and all of the gains that we have gotten thus far are lost. Think of the consequences on, for ex-ample, the potential for other energy sources to be developed in that re-gion\u2014energy that is vital to the world, energy that must flow from that region through the Straits of Hormuz that could be jeopardized if there is a con-vulsion among the border states and the spreading of the anarchy that could simply flow from this most distressed land of uncertainty we call Iraq, this situation that is so fragile at this time. So I urge my colleagues, with no dis- respect to those who put this in the bill, to support the Cochran amend-ment. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I simply ask unanimous consent to send a modification to the desk for an amendment filed, No. 698. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia, I would have to object at this time. We are happy to work with the Senator during the vote to deal with the modification. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I re- spect the manager of the bill, and I thank her. Mrs. MURRAY. How much time re- mains on both sides? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma- jority controls 10 minutes. The minor-ity controls 6 12minutes. That includes 10 minutes for the leadership. Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the amendment which we are going to vote on very shortly in the Senate is a his-toric amendment. It is an amendment which I think will be followed very carefully not just in the United States but around the world, particularly in Iraq. Understand what this amendment does. The Cochran amendment removes the language which starts to bring American troops home. The Cochran language, instead, calls on the Presi-dent to make periodic reports to Con-gress on the progress in Iraq. With all due respect to those who support that amendment, periodic reports will not bring this war to an end. Periodic mes-sages from the White House will not turn over this war to the Iraqis to de-fend their own country. What we have seen in Iraq is the worst foreign policy mistake in our time. We have paid so dearly in our Na-tion for this mistake. Over 3,200 of our bravest soldiers have given their lives. Over 24,000 have come home injured, some with serious injuries that will haunt them for a lifetime. We have spent $500 billion of our treasure in Iraq that could have been spent in the United States for the betterment of our people. We have given to the Iraqi peo-ple more than any other Nation could ask for. We have stood behind them, we have deposed their dictator, we have given them free governance and a chance at a constitution and free elec-tions. Now it is time for us to make it clear to the Iraqis that it is their coun-try, it is their war, and it is their fu-ture. This President recently said we need to continue to send soldiers, more sol-diers, into Iraq. Sadly, many of them are being sent to battle without the equipment, the training, the rest they VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3814 March 27, 2007 need, and the time at home with their families. We are pushing these brave men and women to the limit. Voting for the Cochran amendment says it is enough that the President sends us every 60 or 90 days a report; that he tells us how things are going; how we are doing. Is that why we are in Con-gress, to receive reports from the President, to put them on a bookshelf somewhere and hope a staffer has time to read them? I think not. What we are here to do is speak for the American people who want a new direction in Iraq. They want this Con-gress to stand up once and for all and say to this President that this policy has to change. American soldiers must start to come home in an orderly man-ner and the Iraqis have to stand and defend their own country. A vote for the Cochran amendment, sadly, will take away any type of incentive for the Iraqis to do the right thing for their own Nation. Many have studied this over the last 4 years, a war that has gone on longer than World War II. They have come to the same conclusions \u2014the Iraq Study Group and many others \u2014it is time for the United States to announce a new policy. The Cochran amendment says we will stay with the old policy; we will receive periodic reports from the White House. That is not the answer. What we need to do is to stand be- hind our soldiers by bringing them home as quickly as possible. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. H UTCHISON . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? That exceeds the Senator 's time. Mr. COCHRAN. How much time do I have, Mr. President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has 112minutes before the 5 min- utes. Mr. COCHRAN. I yield 112minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas. Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to use about 5 minutes of my leader time after Senator H UTCHISON , and she needs a minimum of 3 minutes. I will ask unanimous consent that Sen-ator H UTCHISON be allowed to have 112 minutes of my leader time, and I will take about 5 minutes. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will not object if we can add an equal amount of time to the majority side. Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me ask for 2 minutes. I thought the last time the Chair announced the time it was 6 12minutes after Senator W AR- NER. The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 612 minutes, but the leader gets 5 of those 6 12. Mrs. HUTCHISON. I understand. I ask unanimous consent that I be al-lowed 2 minutes, after which the leader will then be allowed his 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Texas is recog- nized. Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me say that the distinguished deputy leader on the other side said that if the Cochran amendment passes, it will be the same strategy, nothing new, nothing changed. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the President heard what the people said in the elections of last year. The President has changed the policy. We have confirmed a gen-eral to go over there and direct a new strategy, which, by all accounts, is be-ginning to have some hope of success. If we do what is in this bill, by not passing the Cochran amendment, it says that the President must com-mence the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq not later than 120 days after the date of this act. That puts a bulls-eye on our troops on the ground. It says we are not committed to do what we said we would do, to stand with Iraq to have a stable democracy in their country. It says that we are just going to leave. We are not stating any benchmarks; we are not stating any success strate-gies; we are saying 120 days and we are gone. What do you think that does to our troops on the ground? What does it say to our allies? Most importantly, what does it say to the enemy? It says the greatest country in the world is going to be there as long as it is not very hard. But when it gets too tough for America, we will leave and we will walk out. That should not be the message of the greatest country on Earth, and I hope we will pass the Cochran amend-ment and do what is right for our coun-try for the long term. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Republican leader. Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, less than 2 weeks ago, a bipartisan major-ity of Senators put aside disagreements over the war in Iraq and agreed on at least one thing and that one thing was that announcing a surrender date for our troops is certainly not in our na-tional interest. It is wrong by the troops who have been risking their lives to bring sta-bility and order throughout Baghdad and Iraq. Certainly, they do not want to tell the enemy they intend to run up the white flag 365 days from today. Set-ting a date for withdrawal is akin to sending a memo to our enemies to rest, refit, and replan until the day we leave. It is a memo to our friends, too, telling them we plan to walk away and leave them on their own, regardless of what we leave behind. We know as well as they do that we can expect the fol-lowing: a Sunni minority exposed to the whims of the Shia majority, ethnic cleansing, and regional instability the consequences of which are painful to contemplate but easy to predict. It is wrong by the commanders in the field, who have been sent into battle with a mission to fulfill and who know better than we do how to carry out that mission. It is wrong by the Iraqis themselves, who have risked their lives and for-tunes on the strength of a promise that the United States of America would stand with them and see this struggle through until the end. We voted against setting a surrender date, despite intense political pressure because common sense tells us that politicians in Washington don 't tell the commanders on the battlefield when the fight is won. Common sense told us something else a few months ago. It told us we had to change course, and that is exactly what we have done. We realized the only way we would win this fight would be to secure the city of Baghdad, the seat of the Iraqi Government, and home to a quarter of its population. We implemented a strategy to do it. Some have said there is no military, only a political solution to ending the violence in Iraq. But we can 't pretend the Iraqis will forge a political solution unless they are secure in their homes and on their streets. That is the key to the Petraeus strategy and to our ef-forts in Baghdad. We have been pursuing that new course for the last few months. A Democratic-controlled Senate sent a new commander into the field of battle to carry it out. We have seen early signs of success, enough to believe this new approach was exactly the right thing to do. Now Congress is being asked to fund it. I agree this is also the right thing to do. We are not about to pull the rug out from under our soldiers in the field just as they begin to carry out the mis-sion we have sent them on. We are going to give them everything they need, and we are not going to slip a deadline now into their security pack-age. The Constitution gives those who op- pose this war a clear and concrete way of expressing their views, and that is to vote against funding it. Attempting to have it both ways \u2014by slipping a with- drawal date into this bill and making the support of our troops contingent on a dangerous and defeatist surrender date\u2014was wrong a week and a half ago and it is wrong now. It is also dangerous. President Bush has repeatedly said he will veto a bill that includes a surrender date. He said it again this morning. He said this spending bill, in its current form, as-sumes and enforces the failure of the new strategy even before American commanders are able to implement their plans and he will veto it if it reaches his desk. I urge my colleagues not to take us down this path, not to delay the deliv-ery of emergency funding to our troops by forcing a Presidential veto. There is no need. Nothing has changed since the majority of us voted against this very same timeline the week before last. Stripping the withdrawal date will not prevent anyone in this Chamber VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3815 March 27, 2007 from expressing his or her views on Iraq. Its only effect would be to delay the delivery of much needed funding and equipment to our soldiers in the field. I strongly urge my colleagues to strike this dangerous provision and support the Cochran amendment. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator K ENNEDY has 212minutes, but he is not here, so I will proceed to wrap up the debate. My friend, the Republican leader, said nothing has changed since the last vote. That is the whole problem, noth-ing has changed. Nothing has changed in over 4 years of this bloody war in Iraq. One course. That course has been followed from the very beginning and has never changed. The choice tonight is very clear. It is as clear as it is important. It is a choice between staying the course in Iraq and changing the course in that faraway land. With their votes, Sen-ators tonight can send a message to the President that it is time to come with us, to help find a new way and end this intractable civil war or Senators can allow this course to continue, allow President Bush to commit more U.S. troops in this open-ended Iraqi civil war. After more than 4 years, the related deaths of 3,250 of our brave soldiers, and the wounded tens of thousands of these men and women, it is time we should change. This war is not worth the spilling of another drop of Amer-ican blood. As it stands, this emer-gency legislation before this body to-night will send a signal to our Presi-dent that it is time for a new direction, it is time to set benchmarks, it is time to send a signal to the Iraqi Govern-ment that they must take responsi-bility for their own people, and it is time to start redeploying our troops and recommitting ourselves to fighting al-Qaida and other terrorists around the world. If this amendment passes, sending a message to the President to change course, that is the right way to go. If, however, Senators decide to allow the President to continue along the line he has outlined for more than 4 years, that would be a shame. That is what this amendment is all about, whether this carefully crafted legislation will be stripped from this bill. It would then turn out to be, instead of a bill that de-mands the President change his policy, that we will have a bill that gives the President a blank check and a green light to continue the failed course we have had in Iraq. Without this language in the supple- mental, the President would be free to keep U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely, serving an impossible mission of polic-ing an acknowledged civil war. Staying the course in Iraq will not lead to suc-cess. There are no military solutions. My friend, the Republican leader, said ''some say. '' ''Some say. '' Well, one person who says the war can 't be won militarily is the man we have com-manding the troops over there, General Petraeus. He said 20 percent of the war is military, the rest is political and diplomatic and economic. That is the way it is. The bill, without this amendment, of- fers a responsible strategy in Iraq, which the American people asked for last November, a strategy that will maximize our chances to succeed in Iraq and enhance our ability to defeat al-Qaida. General after general after general has said that is the right strat-egy. A group of patriotic Americans de-voted a year of their lives to giving the American people and this Congress and the President the advice of their col-lective wisdom \u2014and it was wisdom \u2014 former Secretaries of Defense, Secre-taries of State, college professors, former Members of Congress. They came to the conclusion that we have in this amendment. It is in this bill. The Iraq Study Group agrees with what we have in this legislation. It is time for the Senate to put a stamp of approval on people such as Secretary Jim Baker. He is a man who is a card-carrying Republican. He served as Secretary of State, Chief of Staff for the President of the United States, and he has held other Cabinet positions. He is an example of what that Iraq Study Group was all about. They did it because it was the right thing to do. The reason we are having even minimal contact right now with Iranians is because of Secretary Baker. Secretary Baker said you do not only negotiate with your friends, you have to negotiate with your enemies. I have come to know very well a per- son who is part of my security detail. He has traveled with me all over the country \u2014has been to my home in Searchlight. He is now headed for his third tour of duty in Iraq. He has two little children. He is headed for Iraq. He leaves in less than a month. I ad-mire James for his courage and his pa-triotism, but he should not be going back for a third go-around. He is a Na-tional Guardsman. I understand how some of my col- leagues feel. In this Chamber is J OE LIEBERMAN . There is not a Senator for whom I have more respect than J OE LIEBERMAN . I know how passionately he feels on this issue. JOHNWARNER , seated across from me, is one of my friends. I can say that without any reservation or hesitation. We have served together for many years. I was his subcommittee chair-man in the Environment and Public Works Committee. I know how he feels about this issue, how torn he is as to what is the right thing to do, what is not the right thing to do. I acknowl-edge the feelings of J OHNWARNER and JOELIEBERMAN , but that does not take away from the way I feel about this issue. I have said on this floor before and I will say it again, the sparsely popu-lated State of Nevada has lost 39 sol-diers in Iraq. The last one, I called his mother less than 2 weeks ago. Raul Bravo is dead. He was 21 years old \u2014a marine on his second tour of duty in Iraq. His mother expressed to me what a tremendous loss this was. He was the only man in her family, she said \u2014she and her three daughters. I admire Raul Bravo for going to Iraq twice. He did what he had to do. But we have had too many Raul Bravos dying over there, unnecessarily, in the middle of a civil war. I listened to my radio yesterday morning, as I do every morning. Yes-terday morning: five dead soldiers the day before. I say sincerely that we should not spill any more blood there. We should start redeploying these troops, have them work in counterterrorism, force protection, training the Iraqis. Every one of my colleagues should understand that the Prime Minister of Iraq told the President of the United States to his face the last time they met: Get the American troops out of Baghdad. That is what he told him. This was before the surge that the President came up with. The leader of the country of Iraq told the President of the United States: Get the American troops out of here. The Iraqi people don 't want us there. All the polls show overwhelmingly the people, Iraqi people, don 't want us there. The majority of the people think it is OK to kill and injure Americans. Is that what we want to be involved in? I think not. A lot of people worked very hard on the provision that is subject to being stricken from this bill. This is a good piece of legislation that is in this bill. It is the right thing to do. It is good for America. It is good for our world. And it is good for President Bush. I yield back Senator K ENNEDY 's time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment of the Senator from Mississippi. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. J OHN- SON) is necessarily absent. Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. E NZI). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. E NZI) would have voted ''aye.'' The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SALAZAR ). Are there any other Sen- ators in the chamber desiring to vote?

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SALAZAR ). The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to shortly suggest the absence of a quorum again. I want to tell every-body, it is going to take us a little while to figure out where we go next. I need to meet with Senator M CCONNELL , Senator B YRD, and Senator C OCHRAN . This is not an easy proposition. We have cloture in the morning. As we have heard from both sides, this is a very important bill and we have to move as quickly as we can. Well over 100 amendments have been filed on this bill. That is going to throw a monkey wrench into things. Senator M CCON- NELL has worked in good faith for us to get to the point where we are today. I hope I have done the same. I rep-resented to Senator M CCONNELL we could have a vote on the Iraq bill, and we have done that. I represented to Senator M CCONNELL we could have a vote on the minimum wage, and we al-most have that worked out. I rep-resented to Senator M CCONNELL there were certain amendments a couple of his Senators wanted to offer and we were going to work that out, and I think we have done that. There is something that is wanted on both sides, very important to Senator W YDEN and Senator S MITH, Senator BINGAMAN and Senator B AUCUS , and others. We are at a point where we can resolve that. Beyond that, it is a legislative mess. Standing here in the well, I have had five Senators come up to me and say they had emergency things they needed done. I asked each of them: Is it in the supplemental? No. It makes it tough to try to be every- thing to everybody. We need a little time to see what we can do to work through this. I want to be as fair as we can, but this is an unusual piece of leg-islation. We have a cloture vote in the morning. The staff will work during the night to find out which of the amendments that have been filed ei-ther are germane or appear to be ger-mane or are not. We will not have a vote in the near future. It will be a little while. I would say it will probably take us at least 15 minutes before we know where we are going. We have Senator C OCHRAN , Sen- ator B YRD, who are as experienced as anyone could be on this most impor-tant bill. We will do our best to give everyone an idea of where we are head-ed. Mr. M CCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for an observation? Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky. Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I think we are close to sorting out a way to go forward, as the majority leader has described. As soon as we finish this colloquy, why don 't we get about fig- uring out how to sort that out. Mr. REID. I appreciate that very much. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the Senate now re-turn to the Kennedy amendment and that a Grassley second-degree amend-ment be considered and agreed to; that the Kennedy amendment, as amended, be agreed to and the motion to recon-sider be laid upon the table; that on Wednesday, March 28, there be 30 min-utes of debate to run concurrently with respect to the Wyden amendment No. 709 and the Burr amendment No. 716, with the time equally divided and con-trolled between Senators W YDEN and BURRor their designees; that the Burr amendment be modified to be a first- degree amendment; that no amend-ments be in order to either amend-ment; that there then be 30 minutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on H.R. 1591, with the time equally divided and controlled be-tween the two leaders or their des-ignees; that upon the use of time, with-out further intervening action or de-bate, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Wyden amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Burr amendment, and then a vote on the motion to invoke cloture; that there be 2 minutes of debate equally di-vided prior to each vote; that on Wednesday, it be in order for Senator H AGEL to call up amendment No. 707 and there be 90 minutes of debate under the control of Senator H AGEL ; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the amendment be withdrawn. That would be whether cloture is in-voked or not. And it relates to the Hagel amendment. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have taken, as you know, a long time to get to this point. There are a number of other Senators who have questions, and we are still in the process of work-ing our way through that. I further ask unanimous consent that Senator C OBURN be recognized to call up six amendments en bloc \u2014Nos. 648, 649, 656, 657, 717, and 718; that once they are reported by number, the amend-ments be set aside. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. The Senator from Virginia. AMENDMENT NO . 698, AS MODIFIED Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know there has been a diligent effort on both sides to get the Byrd-Warner amend-ment cleared. I am hoping to get the final clearance from Senator S TEVENS . I know where he is, and I have con-tacted him. If that could just be held in abeyance for a minute or two, in the meantime, may I modify one of the amendments that is filed at the desk? I ask unanimous consent to modify amend- ment No. 698. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, the amend-ment is so modified. The amendment (No. 698), as modi- fied, is as follows: (Purpose: Relating to Iraq) At the end of chapter 3 of title I, add the following: SEC. 1316. IRAQ. (a) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress makes the fol- lowing findings: (1) On the fourth anniversary of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the regime of a brutal dic-tator has been replaced by a democratically elected government in the Arab world. (2) United Nations Security Council Reso- lution 1723, approved November 28, 2006, ''determin[ed] that the situation in Iraq con- tinues to constitute a threat to inter-national peace and security ''. (3) More than 137,000 United States mili- tary personnel are currently serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since March 2003, with the bravery and professionalism con-sistent with the finest traditions of the United States armed forces, and are deserv-ing of the support of all Americans, which they have strongly. (4) Many United States military personnel have lost their lives, and many more have been wounded, in Iraq, and the American people will always honor their sacrifices and honor their families. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3817 March 27, 2007 (5) The United States Army and Marine Corps, including their Reserve and National Guard organizations, together with compo-nents of the other branches of the military, are under enormous strain from multiple, ex-tended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, and these deployments, and those that will follow, will have lasting impacts on the fu-ture recruiting, retention and readiness of our Nation 's all volunteer force. (6) Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating problem of sectarian and intra-sectarian vio-lence based upon political distrust and cul-tural differences between some Sunni and Shia Muslims, concentrated primarily in Baghdad. (7) Iraqis must reach political settlements in order to achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to reach such settle-ments to support a truly unified government greatly contributes to the increasing vio-lence in Iraq. (8) The responsibility for internal security and halting sectarian violence in Iraq must rest primarily with the Government of Iraq, relying on the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). (9) President George W. Bush said on Janu- ary 10, 2007, that ''I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq 's other leaders that America 's commitment is not open-ended '' so as to dispel the contrary impression that exists. (10) It is essential that the Government of Iraq set out measurable and achievable benchmarks and President George W. Bush said, on January 10, 2007, that ''America will change our approach to help the Iraqi gov-ernment as it works to meet these bench-marks ''. (11) According to Secretary of State Rice, Iraq's Policy Committee on National Secu- rity agreed upon a set of political, security, and economic benchmarks and an associated timeline in September 2006 that were \u2014 (A) reaffirmed by Iraq 's Presidency Council on October 6, 2007; (B) referenced by the Iraq Study Group; and (C) posted on the website of the President of Iraq. (12) The Secretary of State indicated on January 30, 2007 that ''we expect the Prime Minister will follow through on his pledges to the President that he would take difficult decisions ''. (13) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified about, and, or, provided unclassified material to members of Congress on Iraqi commitments and goals. (14) Congress acknowledges that the Bagh- dad Security Plan is in its initially months and while there are signs of progress, there are also signs of difficulty and uncertainty. For these reasons, and others, Congress must have timely reports to evaluate in perform-ance of roles under the Constitution of the United States.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The amendments are pending en bloc. Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have filed amendment No. 670 to H.R. 1591. This amendment authorizes the Sec-retary to spend up to $50 million for the establishment and maintenance of a civilian reserve corps to address postconflict situations and other emer-gencies overseas. The amendment pro-vides the Secretary the flexibility to use a portion of the funding in this act to make an urgent effort to recruit and train more civilians in planning and managing stabilization and reconstruc-tion. The Senate embraced the creation of such a civilian corps when it unani-mously passed S. 3322 last May. The funding in this amendment matches the level provided in the House version of the emergency supplemental. If enacted, this amendment provides the Secretary with access to imme-diate funding to recruit and send civil-ians with the appropriate skills to as-sist in reconstruction and stabilization in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as to emerging trouble spots around the world. The United States must have the right structures, personnel, and re-sources in place when an emergency oc-curs. A delay in our response of a few weeks, or even days, can mean the dif-ference between success and failure. Both the State Department and the Defense Department are keenly aware of the importance of this amendment. They understand that, if we cannot work together better as a government in postconflict and other unstable situ-ations, the United States may come to depend even more on our military for tasks and functions far beyond its cur-rent role. This amendment builds on the planning that has already taken place to develop a civilian reserve and jumpstarts it so that it can be avail-able as soon as possible. Mr. President, I would like to have printed in the R ECORD at this point a letter from the Secretary of State strongly endorsing the need for the funding contained in this amendment. There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: THESECRETARY OF STATE , Washington, DC, March 27, 2007. Hon. R ICHARD G. L UGAR , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D EARSENATOR LUGAR : I am writing to ex- press my strong support for including fund-ing of $50 million in the supplemental appro-priations bill to establish a Civilian Reserve Corps. Since our supplemental funding re-quest went forward, we have worked dili-gently to refine a proposal to jump start the creation of a Civilian Reserve Corps. We are pleased the House of Representatives agrees and has included. $50 million in its supple-mental appropriations bill for this purpose. We believe that we are able to justify and to spend wisely these funds in building a re-serve capability to complement our internal surge capacity. We have seen the dangers to U.S. interests that can occur from unstable and ungoverned territories that foster the emer-gence of terrorist organizations. We must find new and better ways to respond to the urgent demands of post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction. The Civilian Reserve Corps, which the President proposed in his State of the Union address, is one way to do just that. We cannot create stability, recon-struct economies, and foster the growth of institutions with military solutions; for these purposes we must call on American ci-vilians who have the necessary expertise to assist in these vital tasks. The Civilian Reserve Corps will tap the creativity, the energy, and the idealism of the American people. I look forward to work-ing with the Congress to advance and refine the legislation which will authorize the use of these funds. Sincerely, Condoleezza Rice. Mr. LUGAR. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on February 6, Secretary of Defense Rob-ert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Peter Pace talked about the ur-gent need for civilian expertise in the Iraq stabilization effort. General Pace also called for more civilian resources for the broader worldwide effort, people who can build judicial and rule of law systems, provide engineering expertise, and bring clean water and electricity to people ''before a country devolves into a state where the terrorists can find a home. '' Passing the amendment will dem- onstrate that there is a keen under-standing in the Senate that we need to move forward now to strengthen our ci-vilian reconstruction capabilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. I recommend this amendment to my colleagues and urge its adoption. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, once again we are debating additional war-time funding for Iraq. Once again, we are trying to mitigate the damage caused by the President 's utterly failed Iraq policy and the failure to properly plan for and manage the aftermath of Saddam Hussein 's fall. I have spoken many times about how damaging this lack of planning has been to our efforts in Iraq and to our standing in the world. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3819 March 27, 2007 For the past 2 months, the spotlight has shone on another administration failure in this war: the shameful condi-tions our wounded soldiers face as out-patients navigating the military health system when they return from Iraq or Afghanistan. This is another example of gross mismanagement and a strained system. As such, I will offer amend-ment No. 766 to improve the care that members of the Armed Forces and vet-erans receive at Walter Reed and other military medical facilities. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that some of the reasons for concern at Walter Reed do not occur in the future. As the living conditions for outpatients at Walter Reed Army Med- ical Center indicate, moving to private contracts for maintenance can cause problems. After a private contract was awarded for maintenance and upkeep of buildings on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, a maintenance crew of approximately 300 was whittled down to 50 by the time the contract went into effect. Many of the terrible living conditions found in Building 18 were a direct result of delays in build-ing repair and maintenance because of a shortage in manpower. To prevent this situation from occurring again, this amendment calls for public-pri-vate competitions of maintenance serv-ices at military medical complexes to stop while our country is engaged in military conflicts. It also calls for a Government Accountability Office re-view of contracting-out decisions for basic maintenance work at military fa-cilities. Other problems discovered at Walter Reed are directly attributable to short-ages resulting from pressures to cut budgets for military medical services. These cuts cannot be tolerated at a time when military medical services are needed to treat servicemembers who have been wounded in Iraq and Af-ghanistan. As such, this amendment would require medical command budg-ets to be equal to or exceed the prior year amount while the Nation is in-volved in a major military conflict or war. Another issue that the conditions at Walter Reed brought up is whether or not the facility should be closed as the Base Realignment and Closure Com-mission recommended. The Commis-sion recommended building new, mod-ern facilities at the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort Belvoir to improve the overall quality of care and access to care in this re-gion. Military leaders have indicated that the planned closure has limited their ability to attract needed profes-sionals to jobs at Walter Reed and there have been concerns raised wheth-er adequate housing for the families of the wounded has been properly planned. To deal with that, this amend-ment requires the Department of De-fense to submit to Congress within one year a detailed plan that includes an evaluation of the following: the desir-ability of being able to guarantee pro-fessional jobs for 2 years or more fol- lowing the closure; detailed construc-tion plans for the new facilities and for new family housing; and the costs and benefits of building all of the needed medical treatment, rehabilitation, and housing before a single unit is moved. Another major problem and source of frustration for injured soldiers is the length of time it takes to receive a dis- ability determination. In order to has-ten the disability determination proc-ess, we need to ensure that the Depart-ment of Defense has information sys-tems capable of communicating with those in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA has been a leader in implementing electronic medical record keeping, but we have to improve the capability of the Department of De-fense to send electronic medical records to the VA to speed up the dis-ability determination process. Making the disability determination system more efficient can reduce the stress on the soldiers and their families going through the determination process. Caseworkers are also critical. They schedule appointments and make sure wounded servicemembers get the reha-bilitative and follow-up care they need. As more and more soldiers and marines come home wounded, many military caseworkers are overwhelmed. To im-prove the care given to servicemem-bers, this amendment requires a min-imum ratio of case managers to pa-tients of 1 to 20, that case managers have contact with recovering service-members at least once a week, and that case managers be properly trained on the military 's disability and discharge systems so they can better assist pa-tients with their paperwork. Currently, many combat veterans re- turning from Iraq and Afghanistan have service-related mental health issues like posttraumatic stress dis-order, PTSD, and traumatic brain in-jury, TBI. Many have labeled TBI the ''signature injury '' of the Iraq and Af- ghanistan conflicts. It is estimated that as many as 10 percent of those serving or who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan have brain injuries. That would mean about 150,000 of the 1.5 mil-lion soldiers who have served in Oper-ation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom have suffered a brain in-jury. In many cases, these injuries are not diagnosed because there is not an external wound. Depending on the se-verity of these injuries, returning sol-diers can require immediate treatment or not have symptoms show up until several years later. This amendment calls for every returning soldier to be screened for TBI. While the VA has an-nounced plans to do this, it needs to happen in active-duty military medical facilities too. In addition, the amend-ment calls for a study on the advis-ability of treating TBI as a presump-tive condition in every service 's dis- ability evaluation system, as well as the VA disability evaluation system. We often hear about the 25,000 sol- diers and marines who have been wounded in these wars \u2014but that figure grossly underestimates the demand that the VA health care system faces. Since our country was attacked on September 11, 2001, more than 1.5 mil-lion soldiers have been deployed to Af-ghanistan, Iraq, and other locations. Of these, 630,000 are now veterans and, ac-cording to the Department of Defense, more than 205,000 have already received medical treatment through the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs. A recent Har-vard study on the long-term costs of treating these new veterans estimates that by 2012 more than 643,000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan will be using the VA system, an almost three- fold increase of what the system faces now. With a significant backlog of claims currently existing, the system is in desperate need of an upgrade. To address this concern, my amendment directs the Secretary of Veterans Af-fairs to submit to Congress a plan for the long-term care needs for veterans for the next 50 years. In addition to this amendment that I offer today, I am happy to have also joined with my colleagues Senators O BAMA and M CCASKILL and offered an amendment based on the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act. My amendment complements the Obama and McCaskill amendment to improve the care our wounded soldiers receive at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and other military medical facilities. I believe both amendments will make medical care better for our military personnel and veterans. I also commend the Ap-propriations Committee for already providing approximately $3.1 billion in funding above the President 's request for health programs in the Department of Defense and the Department of Vet-erans Affairs. Providing $1.3 billion for defense health programs and $1.767 bil-lion for veterans ' health programs is a great step to fix some of the problems we currently face. It is our highest obligation to heal the hundreds of thousands of brave men and women who will bear the physical and emotional scars of these wars for the rest of their lives. While President Bush and his administration may have failed to plan adequately to ensure that these soldiers and veterans receive the care that they deserve, we in Congress must act now to improve this situation. Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior Senator from Massachusetts, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions Committee, in support of amend-ment No. 680. The substance of this amendment is what the Senate passed by a 94-to-3 vote as the minimum wage and small business tax bill on February 1. This amendment would thus extend to hard-working Americans a long- overdue increase in the minimum wage. It is long past time when Con-gress should have increased the min-imum wage. Now some worry that an increase in the minimum wage would burden small VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3820 March 27, 2007 businesses. Smaller businesses employ a disproportionate share of workers earning the minimum wage. Representatives of small businesses have therefore argued that any in-crease in the minimum wage should be accompanied by tax incentives tar-geted for small businesses in order to lower their costs. Small business is particularly impor- tant in rural States like Montana. Rural communities generally do not have large employers. Rural families rely on small businesses for jobs. The Finance Committee has jurisdic- tion over taxes. The committee held a hearing on January 10 entitled ''Tax Incentives for Businesses in Response to a Minimum Wage Increase. '' The committee heard from a variety of wit-nesses, including labor economists, small business owners, and tax experts. Following that hearing, the com- mittee held a markup on January 17. The committee reported an original bill called the Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007. That bill is a revenue-neutral bill containing a number of tax incentives for small businesses and businesses that hire minimum wage workers. The committee favorably reported the bill by unanimous voice vote. And the ma-jority leader included that bill in its entirety in his amendment to the House-passed Fair Minimum Wage Act. That bill passed the Senate on Feb-ruary 1. Now the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-mittee and I have included that bill in its entirety in our amendment to the House-passed supplemental appropria-tions bill, the U.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans ' Health, and Iraq Account- ability Act. The small business tax provisions in- cluded in this amendment will help small businesses to succeed. These pro-visions will spur investment and thus create jobs. They will provide greater opportunity for workers looking for a job. They all enjoy strong support. To carry out day-to-day activities, small business owners are often re-quired to invest significant amounts of money in depreciable property, such as machinery. The amendment would help business owners to afford these large purchases for their businesses. To do so, the amendment would extend for another year expensing under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code. New equipment and property are nec- essary to successfully operate a busi-ness. But large business purchases gen-erally require depreciation across a number of years, and depreciation re-quires additional bookkeeping. Expensing under section 179 allows for an immediate 100-percent deduction of the cost for most personal property purchased for use in a business. In 2007, small business owners may deduct up to $112,000 of equipment expenses. When small business owners are able to expense equipment, they no longer have to keep depreciation records on that equipment. So extending section 179 expensing would ease small busi-ness bookkeeping burdens. The amendment would also allow small business owners to quickly re-cover the cost of improvements to their establishments through extension and expansion of the 15-year straight- line depreciation period for leaseholds and restaurant improvements. Without this provision, they would have to de-preciate over the course of 39 years. Allowing retailers and restaurants to use a 15-year straight-line depreciation period would help entrepreneurs who open a business or remodel their prop-erty. The entrepreneur 's investment could be recovered over a period of time more closely reflecting wear and tear. The amendment would extend the 15- year recovery period for leasehold and restaurant improvements. The amend-ment would also broaden the provision to allow retail owners and new res-taurants to take advantage of this shortened depreciation period. The amendment would also help busi- nesses to provide jobs for workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce by extending and ex-panding the work opportunity tax cred-it or WOTC. WOTC encourages businesses to hire workers who might not otherwise find work. WOTC has been remarkably suc-cessful. By reducing expenditures on public assistance, WOTC is highly cost- effective. The business community is highly supportive of these credits. In-dustries like retail and restaurants that hire many low-skill workers find it especially useful. The amendment would extend WOTC for 5 years, and the amendment would expand the credit to make it available to employers who hire veterans dis-abled after 9/11. As of July 2006, nearly 20,000 mem- bers of our Armed Forces were wound-ed in action in Operation Iraqi Free-dom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Many of these soldiers are now perma-nently disabled. Many do not know what they are going to do. We need to help these young men and women. A modest tax incentive to help them get back into the workforce is one place to start. The amendment would simplify the way that small businesses keep records for tax purposes. The cash method of accounting is often the easiest method of accounting. Allowing small business to use the cash method reduces the ad-ministrative and tax compliance bur-den of these businesses. The amendment would let more busi- nesses take advantage of this method. Businesses with gross receipts up to $10 million would be able to use the cash method. The amendment helps small busi- nesses by modifying S corporation rules. These modifications reduce the effect of what some call the ''sting tax.'' These modifications improve the viability of community banks. Senator G RASSLEY , members of the Finance Committee, and I have worked to develop a balanced package, and I believe that we have succeeded. The language included in the amend- ment is a responsible package that will ensure the continued growth and suc-cess of small businesses. We have also paid for it. Most of the offsets are proposals that the Senate has supported several times before. The offsets include a proposal to end future tax benefits for abusive sale in/ lease out tax shelters, or SILOs. These deals use foreign tax exempt entities to generate sham tax deductions. Even after Congress shut these deals down in 2004, some taxpayers continue to take excessive, unwarranted depreciation deductions on German sewer systems and the like. The IRS says that it has 1,500 of these deals under audit, involv-ing billions, yes, billions, of dollars. The offsets include doubling fines, penalties, and interest on taxes owed as a result of using certain abusive off-shore financial arrangements to avoid paying taxes. Taxpayers who hide their money from the IRS through offshore credit cards and other shady financial arrangements need to get the message that this Congress is serious about end-ing these abuses. The offsets include closing corporate loopholes for companies who re-invented themselves as foreign cor-porations to avoid paying tax here in America. In March of 2002, Senator G RASSLEY and I made it clear that those who put profits ahead of patriot-ism did so at their own peril. The amendment would treat those who moved offshore after that date like a U.S. company, and the amendment would make those companies pay U.S. taxes. The hard-working American tax- payers whom we are trying to help in this amendment should not have to pay more in taxes because some taxpayers are abusing the tax system through tax shelters. They also should not have to bear the burden of civil settlements and punitive damages paid by compa-nies who engage in questionable behav-ior. These are sound tax policy changes. Let us finally enact an increase in the minimum wage, and let us also pass this useful package of tax benefits to help America 's small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support the amend-ment. Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, along with Senator B ONDand Senator C OLE- MAN, I will offer an amendment that addresses an issue about which there has been much news reporting and hearings in both House and Senate sub-committees; namely, the situation fac-ing Iraqi and Afghani interpreters and translators who are bravely working on the front lines with our soldiers and diplomats. Such work is vital to our ef-forts in these two conflicts, yet it often makes them and their families targets for insurgents. This past week, Mr. George Packer wrote a lengthy piece in VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3821 March 27, 2007 the New Yorker on this that I com- mend to my colleagues. My interest in this issue, like many of my colleagues, began last summer when I received e-mails from a first lieutenant in the Indiana National Guard who had recently returned from a tour in Iraq and from a sergeant in the Army who was at the time serving in a combat support hospital, also in Iraq. Aaron Inkenbrandt wrote: During my year in Iraq, I served as a mili- tary Transition team member. As such, I lived exclusively with Iraqi forces and acted as a mentor and advisor to them. My team and I did much to build and train these forces under very difficult circumstances. However, we could not have achieved success without our Iraqi interpreters. I believe that our Nation must reciprocate the loyalty proved by these men by offering to them sanctuary in the United States. Iraqi interpreters are an outstanding group of people. These men not only act as our communicators but also our cultural advi-sors and our friends. Our interpreters share with us the dangers of combat and the rigors of military life. While interpreters are gen-erally well paid, the risks associated in as-sisting Coalition forces are extraordinary. Both at work and at home, interpreters fear for their lives. This fear is often so great that they cannot tell even their closest rel-atives what they do for a living. The insurgency in Iraq has made clear that they will murder any Iraqi caught assisting Coalition Forces. Interpreters are especially prized by insurgents who often pay high bounties for their killings or capture. Iraqis not associated with the insurgency are also hostile toward interpreters. Many Iraqis be-lieve, though wrongly, that interpreters are snitches or traitors. Such hostility makes life very difficult for Iraqi interpreters. '' The withdrawal of Coalition Forces will likely increase rather than decrease the dan-ger posted to interpreters. Without our pro-tection, former interpreters will be left de-fenseless before their enemies and subject to persecution by their friends. In my opinion, [it] would be immoral and contrary to the precepts of our Constitution to abandon these brave patriots in light of the vast sac-rifices that they have made in the cause of freedom. Therefore, I implore you to advo-cate preferable immigration status to all Iraqi interpreters whose loyalty we reason-ably ascertain. The e-mails, and a cable that our then Ambassador to Baghdad, Zalmay Khalilzad, released regarding the life- threatening conditions our Foreign Service Nationals were facing prompt-ed me to write to the Secretary of State last July about the issue. I en-couraged her to develop a policy to ad-dress these various situations and sug-gest legislative language. The United States has experience and tradition in this respect from past wars that pro-vide precedent and guidance. The amendment I am offering today with Senator B ONDand Senator C OLE- MAN is not a conventional amendment for an emergency supplemental, but be-cause it has a direct impact on the mis-sions in Iraq and Afghanistan, we are hopeful this can be included in the package. By virtue of a provision crafted by former Congressman John Hostettler of Indiana, the 2006 Defense authorization bill established a program to allow 50 Iraqis and Afghans who have worked for the U.S. military as translators for at least 12 months to come to the United States on a special visa. The program has been underway now for just over a year and has been met with success and approval by all of the agen-cies who work with it. Since instatement, 445 applications have been received. 377 have been ap-proved, 10 denied and 58 are pending. Under the current cap of 50 per year, it will take until 2016 to admit those cur-rently in the queued \u2014and their fami- lies\u2014for entry to the United States. In order to help reduce this wait- time, my colleagues and I have crafted an amendment that expands the pro-gram to 300 admissions per year and also makes some other technical changes. We change the language to in-clude interpreters as well as trans-lators \u2014as that is the proper term for those who translate conversation while translators work on documents. We also authorize the U.S. Ambassadors in Iraq and Afghanistan to nominate non- Department of Defense personnel under this program, and we exempt those ad-mitted under this program, and their families from the numerical cap of im-migrants who enter in this same, so- called 4th Preference category. Fi-nally, we wish to sunset the program after 3 years. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we have before us today a supplemental appropriations bill that will finally start the process of bringing our troops home. The United States today is in its fifth year in Iraq. The administration offers no apparent road out of Iraq. It offers only an escalation plan that keeps growing, and an open-ended com-mitment to a civil war. The Congress of the United States has an obligation to express its voice on this matter and to offer a solution. The search for a solution has been difficult. We have come to the floor many times this year, and we have struggled to find the right course of ac-tion. I believe that path is before us today. This legislation would initiate the orderly drawdown of our forces and re-define the mission for a small sup-porting force that would remain. It sets benchmarks for the administra-tion and for the Iraqi Government. This legislation calls for actions which this administration has stub-bornly resisted, including the prompt phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. This redeployment would begin within 120 days of the legislation being enacted. The legislation sets a goal of March 31, 2008, for redeploying major combat forces from Iraq. A smaller force would be allowed to remain, with its mission limited to protecting American and co-alition personnel and infrastructure, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting targeted counterterrorism operations. This supplemental also calls for a vigorous ''diplomatic, political, and economic strategy. '' This strategy would involve ''sus- tained engagement with Iraq 's neigh- bors and the international community for the purpose of working collectively to bring stability to Iraq. '' This is the key to ending the violence in Iraq \u2014the recognition that the solu- tion to Iraq lies not in U.S. force but in political accommodation among the Iraqis. This legislation also sets benchmarks for the Iraqi Government. These include deploying trained and ready Iraqi security forces in Baghdad; strengthening the authority of Iraqi commanders to make tactical and operational decisions without political intervention; disarming militias and ensuring that Iraqi security forces are accountable only to the central govern-ment and loyal to the Iraqi Constitu-tion; enacting and implementing legis-lation to ensure that Iraq 's oil is dis- tributed to all Iraqi citizens in an equi-table manner; enacting and imple-menting legislation that reforms the de-Ba 'athification process in Iraq; en- suring a fair process for amending the Iraqi Constitution to protect minority rights; and enacting and implementing rules to protect the rights of minority political parties in the Iraqi Par-liament. Finally, this supplemental requires that the top U.S. commander in Iraq report to Congress on progress by the Iraqi Government in meeting these benchmarks \u201430 days after this act is enacted and every 90 days thereafter. Our Nation 's present course of action is untenable and unsustainable. Our very purpose for being in Iraq bears little resemblance to the reasons Congress authorized the use of military force in October 2002. What do we have as we enter the fifth year of this war? A terrible human toll in dead and in-jured \u20143,200 Americans killed, more than 24,000 wounded, with estimates of Iraqi civilian deaths that soar well into the six figures and a toll on our Treas-ury that is unsustainable. According to the Congressional Re- search Service, the Iraq war is already the fourth most expensive war in U.S. history, behind World War II, Korea and Vietnam. We are spending roughly $8.4 billion in Iraq a month \u2014more than $2 billion a week. So far we have spent nearly $400 billion in Iraq. Think of the opportunity costs to this Nation. Wars cost money. I understand this. But we cannot continue this level of spending on a distant civil war with no exit strategy. If we keep our combat forces in Iraq for years to come \u2014as this ad- ministration seems intent on doing \u2014it will likely become the second costliest war we have ever waged. Our military cannot continue to bear this heavy burden. This war has eroded our troop readiness, depleted military equipment, and left our fighting forces weary. Consider these developments: VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May S3822 March 27, 2007 Army and Marine officers say the rapid pace of deployments into Iraq has put the readiness of their troops into a ''death spiral ''\u2014with 40 percent of gear worn out and soldiers and marines left fatigued and undertrained. Our Nation owes our fighting forces better than this. The 3rd Infantry Division, scram- bling to meet deployment orders, re-portedly has sent injured troops back to Iraq \u2014including ones so badly in- jured that they could not put on their body armor. We owe our fighting forces better than this. The Army 's medical facilities are understaffed and underfunded \u2014not just at Building 18 at Walter Reed \u2014and its medical staff is overwhelmed. We owe our fighting forces better than this. Some 1,800 Marine Corps reservists will get letters this week notifying them that they are being involuntarily recalled for a year, thanks to a short-age of volunteers to fill some jobs in Iraq. This follows news that should make everyone in this Chamber take notice: The 82nd Airborne Division \u2014the sto- ried ''All-American '' Division \u2014is so strained by this war that it can no longer respond on short notice to a cri-sis. For decades, the 82nd Airborne has kept a brigade on round-the-clock alert \u2014ready to respond to a crisis any- where around the globe within 18 to 72 hours. But The New York Times re-ported on March 20 that the 82nd Air-borne can no longer meet this stand-ard\u2014a standard it has long held with pride. I believe the supplemental that we have before us today is the solution to the Iraq problem. It provides a vehicle for Congress to express its sense on Iraq and to require the President to take concrete, measurable steps for- ward. It sets clear deadlines and re-quires vigorous regional diplomacy. It sends a message to an administration marked by arrogance and declares to the Iraqi Government that their time has come. Zalmay Khalilzad, the outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, said as much Mon-day, March 26, in his farewell news con-ference. Mr. Khalilzad was direct: The Iraqi leadership must understand, he said, that time is running out. Finally, most importantly, this legis- lation begins the process of bringing our troops home. We have a choice today. We can vote for a clear-headed Iraq policy or do nothing. We can exercise our constitu-tional oversight duties or we can be a rubberstamp for a failed Iraq policy. I urge my colleagues to choose the first path. To choose the other is to ab-dicate our responsibility. (At the request of Mr. L OTT, the fol- lowing statement was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD .) f VOTE EXPLANATION Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to state my position on the Cochran amendment No. 643 voted on by the U.S. Senate. I was unable to vote due to a family emergency but would have voted in favor of the Cochran amendment. I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of the amendment. I do not support congressional micro- management of military operations and I do not support the congression-ally mandated phased deployment of our troops in Iraq. Troop redeployment decisions should be made by military leaders and the combat commanders who are on the ground in Iraq. I do not favor a set re-deployment date, reporting to our en-emies in language ''cut in stone. '' Congress must provide our troops with the resources they need when they need it. I fully support our Armed Forces personnel in their current mili-tary operations in Iraq and Afghani-stan. I want our troops to come home as soon as possible. My goal has always been for American Armed Forces to stand down as the Iraqi forces stand up. The United States cannot abandon the efforts of the people who have sac-rificed so much. f MORNING BUSINESS Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now go into morning business, with Senators allowed to speak for 10 min-utes on each side. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Is there objection? Hearing no objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator C OBURN be recognized for up to 1 hour. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. f HEALTH CARE Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I under- stand that I am to be able to speak as in morning business for up to 1 hour. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. We are in morning business, and the Senator is recognized for up to 1 hour. Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, if you go out in our country and you ask, besides the war, what is on people 's minds, the No. 1 topic you will hear about is health care. And what are the questions that you hear? Why can 't I choose my own doctor? Why can 't I pick my own health insurance plan? Why do my pre-miums increase every year but my ben-efits don 't increase? Why do I have trouble understanding which benefits my health plan offers? Why does my employer get a tax break from my health care but I don 't? Who can make the best health care decisions for my family, us in Washington, the insur-ance bureaucrats, other people, my em-ployer, or how about me? How about me getting to make a decision about my health care? There is no question America 's health care is broken. It is not that we are getting bad care, it is that we pay a tremendous amount for what we get in our care. The estimates are any-where from $1 out of every $3 to $1 out of every $4 we spend on health care doesn 't go to help anybody get well in this country and doesn 't go to help anybody prevent having an illness. That is $2.2 trillion, and it will be over $2.3 trillion this year. When you see what happens \u2014and these are not my numbers, by the way; these are Price Waterhouse numbers, a breakdown on health care dollars \u2014 what you see are some pretty inter-esting statistics. You see that when we go to spend $1 on health care, 35 per-cent of it goes to hospitals, 21 percent of it goes to doctors, 15 percent goes to prescription drugs, and 5 percent goes to equipment. All the rest of that, the medical li- ability insurance \u2014nobody realizes that is 10 percent. Ten cents out of every dollar we spend goes to medical liabil-ity. We are insuring against a problem in health care \u201410 percent. It costs us 6 percent to process the claims. One-half of all the claims filed against all the insurance companies in this country are denied because the people haven 't met their deductible, and yet we keep sending the claims, keep spending the money. One out of every three people who works in a hospital, one out of every three people who works in a doctor 's office doesn 't do anything to help any- body get well. Why is that? It is because of the system we have set up. If you add this 10 percent for li-ability insurance, 6 percent for proc-essing, 5 percent for marketing, 23 per-cent for the insurance industry profit \u2014 and I doubt seriously it is that low \u2014 what you come up with is 24 percent, as a minimum, that doesn 't have any- thing to do with helping anybody get well. Now, why is that? Why is it we have this system? It is because we have somebody besides the patient choosing what they will get in terms of health care. In Medicaid, it is your State. Of-tentimes in Medicaid it is your State paying a very low rate, so now you get to choose from those who will accept the lowest rates. In Medicare, they tell you exactly what the price is. We spend all our time around here trying to change Medicare, because when we push on the balloon one way, some-thing else pops out. So whether it is the Deficit Reduc- tion Act or some of the other things we have had, what we find is we cannot control this tiger because we have a bureaucratic maze that nobody under-stands. When we try to use price con-trols, when we try to limit expendi-tures, we end up losing control. So what happens? Who makes your health care decisions? Either CMS, the Center for Medicare Services, in con-junction with your State, either for Medicare or Medicaid, your employer, or an insurance company. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3823 March 27, 2007 Whatever happened to you making decisions about your health care, about which doctor, about which insurance policy, about which hospital you want to go to? And why is it that if you hap-pen to be Medicaid, you get to choose less than somebody who doesn 't happen to be Medicaid? Why is it we are treat-ing in an unequal fashion those who are the poorest among us? Why shouldn 't we have the right to pick what insurance benefits are best for us? Why shouldn 't we have the right to choose who is going to be our caregiver, whether it is a doctor, a nurse practitioner, a physician 's assist- ant, a chiropractor, or an optometrist? Why shouldn 't we get to choose that, rather than an insurance company or an employer deciding who we can or cannot see? They also decide the price we are going to pay because we are trying to control all these costs. They are also going to decide which hospital we go to. But how is it that we have a system now where everybody except the pa-tient gets to decide what happens to them in terms of their health care? We can 't afford the health care sys- tem we have today. For one thing, 16 percent of our GDP, the highest of any country in the world by 50 percent, is spent on health care. Although we have good health care, we don 't have better health care than those countries that are spending less. We are spending 16.2 percent, or $2.3 trillion, per year on health care, so we should be 50 percent better off. We should have a 50-percent better life expectancy, 50 percent less heart disease, and 50 percent less can-cer. Of the money we spend on health care, fully three-quarters of that is spent on five diseases. Think about that: 75 cents out of every dollar that actually gets into health care, which is only 60 to 70 per-cent of the money we actually pay into health care, 75 cents of that goes for ei-ther heart disease, stroke, chronic ob-structive pulmonary disease, diabetes, or cancer. Five diseases, most of which are readily preventable \u2014not partially preventable but readily preventable \u2014 through increased prevention activi-ties. This Government this year will spend $20 billion on prevention in 12 different agencies, through 27 different pro-grams, none of which are coordinated to try to maximize the education of the American people to what they need to know about their health care so they can make decisions on prevention. Con-sequently, we are very ineffective with prevention. If you look down the road at what is coming in terms of Medicare and Med-icaid, what you see is an unfunded li-ability of over $60 trillion \u2014$60 tril- lion\u2014we are adding. This isn 't about health care now. That $60 trillion that is getting ready to hit our kids and grandkids in terms of Medicaid and Medicare that we have promised for the future, that we have no way to pay for now, one of the great ways of lessening that number is to change what we do on prevention. Prevention is the key. Grandma was right: An ounce of pre- vention is worth a pound of cure. As a matter of fact, it is said in 2070 $1 out of every $2 that Medicare spends, at our current rates, will be spent on dia-betes \u2014$1 of $2. So when you look at this Medicare number, with the vast majority of the baby boomers who are going to retire and then their genera-tion is going to retire, $1 of every $2 that will be spent by Medicare will be spent on one disease only, which means we only have $1 to spend on all the rest of health care for seniors, plus any at-tempts at prevention and at early diag-nosis or new and modern treatments. We can 't continue without a coherent plan on health care. The other problem that is facing us as a nation is right now we can 't com- pete globally in many areas because of health care costs. When you compare GM and Toyota, there is a four times greater differential for what goes into a car made in this country by one of the Big Three versus what goes into a car made outside of this country by their competitors. So there is no way that we can, in fact, be competitive globally until we handle health care. There is no way we can handle Medi-care and Medicaid until we change the health care system. Myself and R ICHARD BURRand several other Members of the Senate will be in-troducing a bill tomorrow that address-es every problem our health care sys-tem faces today, whether it is tort li-ability, and making sure people get awarded what they need when a mis-take is made during the practice of medicine, or whether it is immuniza-tions. The fact is, we have very few States where we have achieved 90-per-cent immunization. We are going to address every prob- lem we face, the liability that comes at us in the future through Medicaid and Medicare, the problems we face on li-ability, the problems on access, the in-equality that somebody, because they happen to work at a very low-paying job, gets stamped with something on their forehead that says, you are of less value than somebody who happens to work someplace that has great insur-ance and a higher paying job. Our bill changes all of that, and in- stead of going to the Department of Motor Vehicles to wait in line, we are talking about a health care system where you, the consumer, are No. 1. The government isn 't No. 1, the doctor isn't No. 1, the hospital isn 't No. 1, the drug company isn 't No. 1, but you, the patient, become No. 1. You get to choose what insurance you want, you get to choose what kind of insurance you want, and you get to choose how much you will pay for it. We create a new insurance market where everybody gets to play by an even set of rules. How do we do that? We do that by giving everybody the same advantage in this country when it comes to health care, and that is a refundable tax credit, $2,000 for every individual, or $5,000 for every family. What that means is, if you are earning about $120,000 a year or less in this country, you will gain in terms of your taxes off of this bill. If you are making $120,000 or less, what is going to happen is you are going to have the option of staying with your employer, if you like what they have, and that tax credit will be available to your employer. But if you decide you want something different, maybe it offers something you don 't get covered today or doesn 't cover a whole lot of things you think you need, you can take that tax credit and buy that insurance and save the difference in the money for your future health care. The Universal Health Care Choice and Access Act provides $2,000 for every one of the 45 million uninsured tomor-row, every one of them as an indi-vidual. Now, what does that buy? People say: That won 't buy much. Well, if you go to Kentucky and you happen to be 35 years of age, you can buy a $2,000 year-ly deductible policy for $897 and have $1,300 or $1,100 left over between that and the deductible. If you try to buy that same policy in the Chair 's State, it is almost $6,000 for that identical policy. Why? Because government has decided in New Jersey differently than what government has decided in Ken-tucky. Therefore, the cost of getting this minimal coverage, because of the mandates put on by government \u2014not what a patient wants but by what gov-ernment says patients should have \u2014 makes that unavailable in New Jersey. How do we fix that? We allow people to buy insurance anywhere they want, just like they buy their auto insurance today; like they buy their homeowner 's insurance. They can buy it from any company anywhere in America, as long as they have a registration with a State. We create a primary and a sec-ondary location for that. So if you want to buy something that has a bet-ter price, that fits your needs, you have the capability to do that and put the difference into a health savings ac-count, where you can use it for future health care needs, that you can use to apply to any deductible, or if you get enough money in it, you can bring it down to where, if you want to, you can have a zero deductible \u2014if you want \u2014 but most people will not want to do that. We allow you to select a health plan that truly meets your family 's needs, not what some Government bu-reaucrat says or some Senator says you must have. It is what you want. We allow individuals to choose what they want in terms of their health care. What will that do in terms of the market? That is going to create inno-vation in the health care market all across this country. It is going to cause competition like crazy for the dollars. Once we truly have competition, which is something we do not have in health care today, which we tremendously need, then we are going to see a big change. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3824 March 27, 2007 The other thing this does is it gives access for affordable health care for a ton of people who do not have it today. They get to choose their health care provider. The patient gets to choose who takes care of them. Not the Gov-ernment, not their employer, not the Senate, not their State insurance com-missioner, but they are going to get to choose who is going to take care of them. It is the right to choose who is going to care for you. How do we do that for the States? We do not mandate anything for anyone. We do not say anybody has to do any-thing. But we create a lot of incen-tives. We tell the States that, if you want to, you can take your Medicaid funds and your disproportionate share funds and anybody who is Medicaid eli-gible, under the 133 percent of poverty level, you can take their $2,000, plus the Medicaid money, plus the DSH money, and you can help them buy an insurance policy in your State. If you want to stay with Medicaid, you can stay with Medicaid. There is no man-date from the Federal Government other than to get people into coverage. You ask any government tomorrow if they would take $2,000 per eligible per-son in their Medicaid program, would they take a deal with them having the freedom to design what is best for their State? Every Governor will tell you yes. Every Governor will tell you yes. Why? Because now we are given the re-sources there to allow a Medicaid pa-tient to be just like everybody else \u2014a Senator, their mayor or somebody who works at the best factory in town. They have an option to not be discrimi-nated against because they show a Medicaid card. Now they have an insur-ance card. People ask: What about the people who do not want to have insur-ance? We allow the States the oppor-tunity to have a default mechanism. If the State of Tennessee \u2014I see the Sen- ator from Tennessee here. If the State of Tennessee wants to decide we will option, if we have people in our State who are going to be so irresponsible that they will not even buy themselves coverage and they have an opportunity to take tax money to do that, then we are going to create a default mecha-nism whereby the State of Tennessee \u2014 if you are a 25-year-old motorcycle rider and you don 't want to buy insur- ance, they can take your tax credit and buy a high-deductible policy for you so when you go to the ER, all the rest of us don 't have to pay all your costs. What is happening in our health care system is we keep transferring the costs so we have a rationale for jump-ing up the price because they are doing something for somebody else at a low price. What the real facts are \u2014and we never hear it \u2014the real facts are, when you look at the hospitals out there, all\u2014the vast majority of them \u2014and this is a very key, important point \u2014 the vast majority are nonprofit enti-ties. That means they pay no income taxes, they pay no payroll taxes. On order, the vast majority, and on aver- age, offer 10 percent of their total billed care as indigent care. But that is not a real number. The reason it is not a real number is be-cause they bill the highest prices they have for that indigent care. If you look at the cost of that care, it would be far below that. I know in the State of Oklahoma, the hospitals there last year billed over $5 billion in revenue, made over $5 billion in profit, and out of that they billed another $400-some- odd million in care that was uncollectible to people who did not have insurance or couldn 't pay. That was not really their cost. That was their billed price. Remember, we give this nonprofit status to all these entities, this $500 million worth of profit in Oklahoma, for example, and they pay no taxes on that. They pay no real estate taxes. In essence, they offer about $100 million worth of charitable care. What this bill does is it takes away all the cost shifting. What are the other things we do? We incentivize high-risk pools. What about the person who gets a chronic illness and they say all of a sudden their in-surance company drops them. We have incentivized so the insurance company is not going to do that. In every State we give a bonus if they set up a high- risk pool and then the high-risk pool is funded out of everybody who is insured in that State. So if you have an insurer insuring someone with complications from diabetes and they say we will drop this person because it is too cost-ly, they go to the high-risk pool. Guess what. That insurance company is going to pay for them anyway. There is no benefit for them to drop them. There is all the benefit then for that insurance company to get busy and involved in managing the chronic disease, where we know we can eliminate complica-tions, we can improve the quality of life, and we can also increase life ex-pectancy by managing the chronic dis-ease. Here is what we do for Medicaid pa- tients. They get a $2,000 check from the Federal Government plus from their State. They can go into whatever plan they want. If their State says we want to stay with Medicaid and take that in enhanced Medicaid, the State gets to do that. There is not a mandate in any-thing. What it says is: If you think a State Medicaid Program is better for your State, without choice, then you can do it. But all the rest of the States are going to say I think I would rather have our Medicaid patients have a true insurance, a real card where they have the same access, the same equality of access as anybody else. All of a sudden you have everybody in the marketplace compete. They can stay in a State-run system. They get to save what they don 't spend on their health care for future health care needs. One of our problems is savings in this country. It is important. How do we fix our health care system? We know that, if we look at the liability costs that showed 10 percent of the health insur-ance dollar going for liability insur-ance, that is an underestimate. The American Hospital Association found, recently reestablished by another orga-nization, I can 't remember who, that repeated the study \u2014what we know is each year, today, besides that 10 per-cent, providers order another 8 percent of the cost of health care for tests that patients do not need. Why do they do that? They do that because they perceive they need to have everything on the books to defend themselves that they can have, so they fire a shotgun at it. We will get this test, this test, this test \u2014knowing they don't need it but they operate under the ''what if '' scenario, this adversary system that we have. Finally, we address liability. We give another percentage bonus to the States that will set up what is called a ''health court '' system. It is a real sim- ple system. If you have a complaint against a provider, a hospital or a doc-tor, you can go to the health court. You don 't have to go to the health court. But you can go to the health court and you can be seen in front of three lawyers, three doctors, and a judge who have their own expert wit-nesses. This judge is schooled in med-ical malpractice. They can make a de-cision for you right then. If you accept the decision, then you give up your right to go to court. If you don't accept the decision, you can 't ever come back to that court on that particular issue, but everything you do in court is admissible. We do not take away anybody 's right to go to court. But what we do accomplish is making sure people get made whole quicker and cheaper \u201440 percent now doesn 't go to the trial lawyer for you to get made whole. There is no question we make mis- takes in medicine every year. But why should we drag it out for 3 to 5 years, No. 1. Why should we pay 40 percent of whatever the ultimate award is to somebody who helped us accomplish that, where we can set up a system that will arbitrate that in front of a nonbiased group of peers, lawyers and doctors who say: Here is the right thing, here is the medical case, the legal case, let 's make a decision and send it on. What it does is it saves tons of money directly, but what will it do? As soon as you create confidence on the part of providers that they do not have to order this other 8 percent of tests, you are going to see that dropping about half. So we can gain 4 percent in this cost of health care by setting up health courts, by changing the dy-namic under which we make sure peo-ple are made whole when something happens to them in the medical mal-practice area. Not every State has to do this. But if your State decides to do this, you get a 1-percent bonus on your Medicaid money \u2014out of a large pool. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3825 March 27, 2007 We have lots of ways in which we do not say we want the States to do this and now we are going to tell you how to do it. We are saying here are some ways we think you can also do it. Go figure out the best way for you, and by the way, if you do some of the things that we think will save some money, here is some extra money for you. Ultimately, if we do not fix health care\u2014everybody in this Chamber knows we are going to go the way of Western Europe and that is the fol-lowing: We are going to decide that we are going to have a single-payer system run by the Government. As P.J. O'Rourke says: ''If you think medicine is expensive now, wait until it is free. '' We are going to control costs. We are going to do it the same way we are try-ing to control costs with CMS. What happens? What happens is we are going to start rationing care. Let's take some real statistics. In England, diagnosis? Cancer. In Eng-land, if you get a diagnosis of cancer right now, the average starting time for your chemotherapy is 10 months after your diagnosis. Anybody here who wants that kind of medicine will vote against this bill. That is exactly what we get. We get rationing. What it means is people with great potential will not get the treatment in time to capture that great potential. What it means is great suffering. What it means is loss of innovation. What it means is a lack of available, fair ac-cess. It is everything in England in their health care system takes away all freedom. It is also interesting to know this past year in Canada there was a law-suit filed, which was won. What this in-dividual said is the Canadian law says I can 't go to anybody except a Cana- dian doctor who is owned and run by the Government. They challenged that. The Canadian supreme court ruled on the side of the patient: You ought to have the right and freedom to go wher-ever you want, to whomever you want if you are willing to pay the bill. Paying the bill is the insurance part of this. If you want to be able to have that access, then you are going to want to be able to buy a policy that allows you to have it. If you don 't want that access, you can buy a policy that says here is a straight HMO, here are the only four doctors you can go to, and here is the hospital you are going to get to go to. We are talking about freedom in health care. How do we get to the bot-tom line, away from 16 percent of our GDP, down to 10 percent of our GDP? More importantly, how do we create a system that gives us better quality, at lower cost, with better value. That is what we are talking about. I yield to the Senator from North Carolina. Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Oklahoma, a dear friend and somebody who has been pas-sionate about health care for years. He and I came to Washington together in 1995. We served on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and we recog-nized then that changes needed to be made. Every year we have seen the same response in Washington. We have seen the end of a calendar year come, the need to find savings in health care. Administrations, Republican and Democratic, turn to Medicare and Med-icaid and say we are going to extract $60 billion, $70 billion out of savings in these health care systems. We have laughed as they called it ''waste, fraud, and abuse '' because there is waste, fraud and abuse in it. We just didn 't get any money out of it because we have been reluctant to fix the health care system in this country. What are we doing? What is this plan? This plan is universal health care. Let me say it again. This plan is universal health care. This is providing affordable, accessible health care, pro-vided by the private sector, for every American in this country. This is change in the design of health care that has been historically, up to this point, employer negotiated, the majority employer paid for, and an em-ployee has very little input into the makeup of the policies that cover them. It doesn 't reflect their age, it doesn 't reflect their health conditions, it does not reflect their income. What we are talking about is shifting it away from employers over time. We are talking about creating real incen-tives for individuals. We are talking about making sure 47 million unin-sured Americans today and tomorrow have tax credits that can be used for real insurance coverage. What does that provide for them? For the first time, it creates a relationship between a patient and a health care profes-sional. We have talked in this institution, we have talked in this town, and we have talked in this country about the need to project wellness and prevention in health care. Well, this does it. This, for once, accomplishes that because we as individuals can negotiate our plans, not through the group plan but as 250 million-plus Americans. We can nego-tiate what makes sense for us from the standpoint of the scope of coverage that reflects what we are willing to pay as it relates to premium \u2014and, by the way, provides States the capability to do the same thing with their Medicaid beneficiaries, their Medicaid patients, if, in fact, they want to begin to change the way their care is delivered, by creating the same relationship be-tween a health care professional and them, because they now have the same insurance we do. Medicaid beneficiaries have this big ''M'' on their foreheads. They do not want to be on Medicaid, but they are there because it is the last resort. What we want to do is integrate them into what all of the rest of us have; that is, individual insurance. Dr. C OBURN hit on a real key; that is, an attempt to bring everyone 's health care costs down. It is not to pick out a group and to say, We are going to re-duce yours, and pick out a group over here and say, We are going to reduce yours. This is an attempt \u2014it is the first real attempt \u2014to bring every- body 's health care costs down. What we learned when we created Part D Medicare, the drug benefit for 35 million-plus seniors in this country, was that when we created real competi-tion between insurers and we brought transparency to price, two very real things happened: In the first year, pre-miums dropped 28 percent over what we had projected, and drug pricing dropped 33 percent. We have a model we have already tried that seniors across this country say: Do not mess with this plan. That, in fact, exemplifies what we are trying to do. We are trying to create real com-petition between insurance for our in-surance business; we are not letting one employer negotiate the plan and then dump it on the employees. But the question is, Can we have the same results as Part D by seeing the cost of health care reduced for all Americans? Well, you start that process when you eliminate cost-shifting. You accelerate that process when you inject what this bill does; that is, transparency in the price of health care that is delivered to you. Imagine the day that you can go on- line and you can actually see what your doctor 's visit is going to cost, what the lab workup is going to cost, what a visit to the emergency room at your local hospital is going to cost. In markets in North Carolina today, some choose not to go to the hospital for the nonemergency care, even though that may be their primary provider; they choose to go to the community health center because the community health center actually delivers the same if not a better level of care. But one thing is for certain: They know exactly what it is going to cost them. And these are in-dividuals who are insured. For the first time, all Americans have an opportunity at prevention and wellness. What does that mean? It means we can make decisions about our health care that have an impact on the cost of our health care to us and consequently have a ripple effect across the marketplace, that as more and more Americans make healthy de-cisions, the cost of health care overall comes down. It means we have freed up those valu- able health care dollars to make sure they are there for the individuals who are going to be susceptible to disease \u2014 chronic or terminal illness. It means the relationship we have now established between patient and health care professionals means we have recognized we can accumulate the data we need so that Medicare reim-bursements are no longer a shot in the dark where we pull a number down that may not be reflective of the cost of delivering the service, may not be reflective of the value of the service. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3826 March 27, 2007 The reality is that when we create that relationship, we are able to accomplish the accumulation of data that tells us what things really should cost. In health care, those healthy deci- sions allow individuals to make deci-sions about disease management. The most costly part of the U.S. health care system is the chronic diseases that exist and our inability to manage those diseases. The most expensive is diabetes. Today, we have electronic capabili- ties for diabetics and for coronary heart patients where, at different peri-ods during the day, their vital signs can be transmitted over a telephone line to their doctor. The doctor can in-stantly know whether, if it is a dia-betic, they are managing their insulin. If it is a coronary heart patient, they can determine whether the fluid build-up means they need to adjust their medication. What does that give us the ability to do? It means we can take a patient who up to that point got too much fluid on the heart, made an emer-gency room visit, and in all likelihood was admitted for 3 days as they get the medicine back in balance. Now, a doc-tor, 24 hours a day, as these reports come in, can change their diuretic, can work with a diabetic on checking their blood sugar and what their insulin in-take is, can detect whether they took the right medication. We can extrapo-late that across every disease because technology now lets us do it in a real way. If we are not able to do this, then we are not able to recognize the value of new technology. So much technology today that would benefit us in the Medicare mar-ketplace is not reimbursable by Medi-care. It is a decision they make be-cause it is not tested in the market-place; therefore, it has no value be-cause they do not know how to reim-burse for it. Well, the reality is, when you have a health care system that re-sponds to the benefits to individuals, all of a sudden you have the market that creates a value for the tech-nologies and for the innovations. So I am delighted to be here. There is so much to this bill. This bill is the most comprehensive transformation of the health care system in my lifetime. One might say it is difficult to do so big a bite at one time. I made that mis-take. The reality is that when you look at the timeline we are up against every year we do not adopt this type of trans-formation of our health care system, more Americans become uninsured, more individuals with preexisting con- ditions no longer can afford health care, and the cost of everybody 's health care in America goes up because we have not eliminated cost-shifting. With disease management we could do today if, in fact, people had incen-tives in their system to take the time to monitor their health, to take their medication, to counsel with health care professionals about changes they could make, the more money we can save not only for each one of us but for the total system. I am convinced that if you could only pick one thing out of this plan that you highlighted for the American peo-ple, it would be this: For the first time, we are presenting a very real way to insure 47 million Americans, the people who are most at risk in this country. If all of us were the beneficiaries in some way of reduced prices, more access, the ability to have transparency in pricing, the accumulation of data, electronic medical records that enable us to find savings, if that is the byproduct of us finding a way to use savings in the sys-tem to insure 47 million Americans, I believe that is the right thing to do. The President came out in the State of the Union and he presented a very similar plan. Our plan expands on what the President said. Our plan goes to the heart of the health care system and says: If we are going to change it, then we have to go through total trans-formation. This is that total trans-formation that at the end of the day empowers every individual in this country to have custom health care coverage for themselves, for everyone in their family, for their health condi-tions, for their income and, more im-portantly, for their security. So I commend the Senator for his work. I now look forward to working with him as we go through what I think will be a very intellectual debate about the future of health care in this country. As some look at Europe and look at other countries and say, Maybe we ought to do that in the future, I be-lieve if we adopt this method we are going to have every country in the world looking at this model and say-ing, How do we do this? How fast can we do that? Mr. COBURN. People may be saying: Well, how do you know this will work? There is a great little company named MedEncentive. They have been running pilot programs all across the country. Let me explain what they do. They get doctors to agree to follow a certain set of protocols called best practices, and they sign up communities, municipali-ties, and their employees, and then they do a couple of things. They take them under coverage, and they reward the employee \u2014i.e, the patient \u2014if they will use those doctors. What is unique about this system? One is, after the patient has finished their office visit with the doctor, they have a patient-doctor interactive form they fill out that says: The doctor wants me to take this medicine. I un-derstand this. Here is the reason he wants me to take this. So they have to fill out the form to say they really un-derstood. The other thing is, on the profes- sional side, the practitioner side, they agree to follow the best-practice model in how they treat these patients. That was actually developed by Vanderbilt, where they followed a best-practice guideline which helps them decide what to order, what not to order, what to do, what not to do in terms of what is best for that patient. They can get off if they choose to, if they think in their medical judgment that they need to. What has been the result? The three published results that I know of, in all three communities, in the first year of operating this where there was this competitive model, best-practice qual-ity outline, patient followup, because the insurance company is involved in making sure the patient does that \u2014 what happened to their health care costs? One down 18 percent, one de-clined 22 percent, and one declined 12 percent. Now, that is just in three. Each one of them had 300 or 400 pa-tients and took all comers, chronic dis-ease or not. How did their costs go down? The costs went down for a lot of reasons. One is they were practicing not defen-sive medicine, they were practicing real medicine. They were not throwing tests at a patient because they were worried but because they had the back-ground of the excellence of Vanderbilt University as a practice guideline at their defense. So what we know is that in the var- ious test models where true marketing, true competition, true transparency as far as price, true concern for the pa-tients ' well-being, not just at the office visit but thereafter, wellness and pre-vention were modified, what happens is costs go down. That is just in three cities in Okla- homa. It has been done all across this country. But what we do know is that if we attack it in a nonbureaucratic way, but we allow competitive forces \u2014 which would you rather have, an insur-ance company that is invested to try to make your health better or one that just wants to make a dollar on you and turn on you? So going back, let me just kind of summarize. The system we have today limits our ability to do what we as Americans do well; that is, discern value for what we have purchased \u2014dis- cern whether we get value for it, dis-cern how to do it, and we discern that on an individual basis. Our health care is not designed on an individual basis. In many places, we get one-size-fits-all; what the Govern-ment says you will have or what the State says you must have, you must buy this. I believe a lot of our problems have come because we have tried to micromanage it from Washington and from the statehouse. What we are talk-ing about is giving freedom of choice, not just to patients and providers but to insurance industries. Imagine the tremendous possibilities that will come into a market that says: This is a new day. I get to market all sorts of different things that might match up with different people. All of a sudden, now I will have to compete not only with people in my State but all across the country for the best plan that gives me the best value that meets my needs. Why would we not want that? We have that in every other VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3827 March 27, 2007 thing. Why would we not want to cap- ture the best aspect of the American consumer, which is discernment? Not long ago I was sitting with some friends and put forth the fact that I be-lieve Americans are smart enough to know what they want in health care. The idea got pooh-poohed. I thought, how insulting. We can figure out what computer to buy and how much mem-ory we want and how big a hard drive we want and whether we want a photo section on it or a print lab. We can fig-ure out all of those things \u2014as a matter of fact, our 10-year-old kids can figure that out \u2014but we can 't figure out how to buy health care. We are going to say to the American people: You are not sophisticated enough, you are not smart enough to know what is good for you or to know what you need. So, therefore, the Government is going to tell you what you need. That is what we have today, whether it is the Gov-ernment or your employer or some-where else. This bill changes all that. This is a bill that will create transparency so you as a consumer can know what something is going to cost. It is going to create a situation where you can perceive whether you have value. It is going to create an incentive to save for health care for the future and an incen-tive for wellness, not just by what the insurance company will come to sell you but by the $20 billion that we are now spending, of which less than $2 or $3 billion makes any difference at all in somebody 's health care. We are going to focus that on true prevention. We are going to direct that the HHS relook at every one of these programs and de-velop a model to where we educate the American people about the risk. Let me give a personal story. I am a colon cancer survivor. What we do know is with good prevention and good screening, one out of every two people who are going to get colon cancer we can keep from getting it. Why wouldn 't we do that? Why wouldn 't we prevent half the colon cancer in this country? We don 't have a good reason. One of the reasons is because we have an inef-fective prevention program. I am a small government person; I admit that. But there is a legitimate role for the Federal Government when it comes to teaching America about our health needs, prevention, and wellness. We have plenty of money to do it if we take the same money we have now and redirect it in a way that educates the American people. Innova-tion works. We know that. Competition works. Take, for example, a year ago a 46- inch plasma TV cost $11,526. Today you can buy the same thing for $2,300. Next year you will be able to buy it for $1,400. The next year you will be able to buy it for $700. Why? Competition. Competition breeds quality and value, only if you have a market under which you can operate. We don 't have that today in health care. Innovation also works in health care. Look at Lasik. Here is a procedure that is not paid for by the Government. It is not paid for by any of the insur-ance industry. But if you are near-sighted and you want to be able to look far away, you can get that done. When it first started, it was $4,000 an eye. Now there are places you can get it done\u2014the same piece of equipment, the same computer \u2014for $500 an eye. Why won't that work? It will work in health care. It will work. Innovation will come as a result of that. What happens when we innovate. What we get is better quality at a lower price and better value. I am hopeful that as the American people look at this, they will be reminded of a couple things. This is universal cov-erage. Everybody in America gets treated the same by the Federal Gov-ernment when it comes to health care. Everybody in America is on equal foot-ing as far as the Income Tax Code is concerned when you go to buy your health care. No longer do we advantage the very rich with $2,700 a year in tax benefit and the very poor with $100. We totally neutralize that and say: Every-body ought to be treated the same under the Tax Code for health care. It is universal coverage. No. 2, it takes away discrimination. Because you are poor, because you don't have the ability to have a job that has insurance coverage today, and if, in fact, you are at 133 percent of poverty, why should you be discrimi-nated against because you are on the Medicaid Program? This is no offense to any practicing professional out there because there are great profes-sionals who are taking care of Med-icaid patients. But if you look at the marketeering, the ones with the best doctors, as a rule, because Medicaid pays so low, do they have time to take care of Medicaid patients? No. What happens is, somehow they don 't have time. So what we have done is dis-criminated down with Medicaid pa-tients. Why shouldn 't a Medicaid patient get the best doctor every time, just like a Senator? Why shouldn 't they have ac- cess to capability? Why should they be discriminated against by having a Med-icaid stamp on their forehead? We are talking about universal access, equal-ity of care, and personal freedom and choice. You get to decide what is best for you and your health care and your family. By the way, when you get this money and you haven 't spent it all, you get to save it for next year and the year after and the year after. You can buy what is best for you with that money. This money also goes to retirees. If you retire at 60 and are not eligible for Medicare, you still get your tax credit. We don 't discriminate against any- body. Everybody gets the tax credit. The final thing I would say, it doesn 't cost the American taxpayer one additional dollar in income tax. There will be no increased cost with this plan. Actually, we have tried to make it revenue neutral. My worry is that it will save us money. We have tried to make it where it does not. We have tried to make it the most gen-erous thing we can to get the most cov-erage for everybody out there. Again, prevention first, free choice, freedom, and liberty. You get to decide who cares for you, what insurance, what hospital, and every American gets that. It is the Government not telling you what you must do but saying here is what you can do if you want. I yield to the Senator from North Carolina if he has any additional com-ments. Mr. BURR. I would only use that time to thank the Senator from Okla-homa. This is a crucial debate that this country needs to have, this institution needs to have. More importantly, we are at a point where we have to stop talking about what we are going to do and actually start doing something. The Senator from Oklahoma has stated it very well. What we can do is bring a higher level of care to all Americans \u2014 not just some Americans, to all Ameri-cans. Through that effort, all Ameri-cans receive a financial benefit. Our system prospers because we are able to take care of more, and we are able to provide an unlimited opportunity in the future because we unleash innova-tion and technology in health care. I have wondered what it would be like if we had innovation at the same level in health care as, say, in cell phones; that we would have a new plat-form every 6 years, and that platform would provide an array of opportuni-ties to us that we are not forced to take, but they are available to us if, in fact, we want them. Health care has been starved of innovation, in large measure because it treats every Amer-ican differently. This is the first real opportunity for universal coverage, universal access, where every Amer-ican has an opportunity at the best coverage available. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. COBURN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BROWN). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f RENO-TAHOE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS NETWORK Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Reno-Tahoe Young Pro-fessionals Network, RTYPN. This im-portant organization has been formed recently by local community leaders and will provide a significant service to northern Nevada. I am pleased to rec-ognize the group here today. The Reno-Tahoe area has been grow- ing swiftly for the past decade. The re-gion enjoys a strong and relatively di-verse economy, offering a range of jobs VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, 27, 2007 and professional opportunities. Reno- Tahoe also offers a wonderful quality of life and some of the finest rec-reational opportunities in the Nation. Despite the overall growth and unde- niable lures to the region, it has not succeeded as well in attracting and re-taining young professionals, a demo-graphic critical to its continued and fu-ture economic growth. To address this issue, the Economic Development Au-thority of Western Nevada, EDAWN \u2014 through the leadership of Chuck Alvey, Michael Thomas, and consultant Stacey Crowley \u2014wisely recognized the need to provide young local profes-sionals with an opportunity to mean-ingfully engage with regional business and community leaders and participate in directing the region 's future. Toward that end, EDAWN launched the RTYPN, an organization designed to teach valuable skills, provide net-working and leadership opportunities and participate in the regional discus-sion about how to capitalize on the re-gion's assets to grow a better commu- nity and economy for the future. With the partnership of organizations such as EDAWN and the Reno Sparks Cham-ber of Commerce, the creation of RTYPN shows the vision and resource-fulness of the Reno-Tahoe community and I am eager to learn of RTYPN 's fu- ture successes. f NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on Janu- ary 17, 2007, Senator I NOUYE and I in- troduced S. 310, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007 to extend the Federal policy of self- governance and self-determination to Hawaii 's indigenous people. This meas- ure is of critical importance to the peo-ple of Hawaii. It would, at long last, clarify the existing legal and political relationship of Native Hawaiians with the United States, allowing for the for-mation of a government-to-government relationship. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very well aware of the support of the Sen-ator from Hawaii for this measure and his determination to see it enacted. As a result of the hard work by Senator A KAKA as well as his colleague, Senator INOUYE , on behalf of this legislation, every Member of this body should know how important this bill is to the people of Hawaii. Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator for his recognition of our continuing perse-verance and unwavering resolve to move this measure forward. At its core, S. 310 is about equity. It is about estab-lishing parity in the Federal policies towards Native Americans, Alaska Na-tives, and Native Hawaiians. Our U.S. Constitution is clear in the means by which it addresses the status of the in-digenous, native people of this land. It is a status based not on consideration of race or ethnicity, but rather on the political relationship that existed be-tween the United States and the native people who occupied and exercised sov- ereignty over lands that later became part of the United States. Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the sen- ior Senator from Hawaii is absolutely correct, and I appreciate both his com-ments and that of our majority leader about my efforts to date. I first intro-duced this bill, together with the mem-bers of Hawaii 's Congressional Delega- tion, in 1999. And, I have introduced a similar bill every Congress. In each Congress, the bill has been favorably reported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and its companion measure has been favorably reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources. During the 109th Congress, Senator I NOUYE and I were successful in filing a cloture motion to proceed to the bill. This procedural action required 60 votes to bring the bill, S. 147, to the Senate floor for a full debate and vote. Falling four votes short of the required 60 votes, cloture was not invoked. As a result, the Senate has not yet voted on the substance and merits of this bill. In fact, the cloture vote demonstrated that if the measure was considered on an up-or-down vote, the votes are here to pass it by a simple majority. Senator I NOUYE and I are currently working to have S. 310 considered by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in the near future, and brought to the Senate floor shortly thereafter. In the U.S. House of Representatives, the companion measure, H.R. 505, was scheduled for markup by the House Natural Resources Committee, but Ha-waii Congressman A BERCROMBIE was not able to be present. At Congressman A BERCROMBIE 's request, H.R. 505 is being rescheduled for committee con-sideration shortly. Mr. REID. Mr. President, through his position on the Indian Affairs Com-mittee, the senior Senator from Hawaii has demonstrated leadership on and knowledge of Indian issues. He has been second to no Member in this body with his empathetic advocacy for fair and equitable treatment of Native Americans. I can clearly understand what drives both Hawaii Senators to secure some measure of fairness and self-determination for the indigenous people of their beautiful home State. Senator A KAKA 's description of events here in the Senate culminating with a failed cloture vote was accurate. However, I want to be very clear to every Member of this body: As a Sen-ator from Nevada, I strongly support S. 310. As majority leader, I am com-mitted to ensuring Senate consider-ation of S. 310 and will work with the Senators from Hawaii to gain the sup-port of members from both sides of the aisle. This is my commitment to the gentlemen from Hawaii. Mr. INOUYE. We thank you, the leader. Native Hawaiian programs and institutions continue to be under at-tack in the courts. Hence, there is an urgency to act and to clarify that the status of Native Hawaiians is a polit-ical question best left to the political arena, namely the Congress, to resolve. Mr. AKAKA. I deeply appreciate the leader 's commitment and support. Ha- waii is the only homeland of the Native Hawaiian people, and I remain com-mitted to empowering the people of Ha-waii and our Nation to preserve a Ha-waii that respects Native Hawaiians and the contributions made by those who have made Hawaii their home. f BUDGET RESOLUTION Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I voted against the budget resolution for the 2008 fiscal year because it con-tained record-breaking tax increases on hard-working American families in a time when we should be putting more money back into the pockets of tax-payers, not taking it out. This year 's budget resolution is historical because it proposes the largest tax increase ever\u2014$916 billion in tax increases on the backs of the American people. This is almost four times the amount of the second largest tax hike in history, $240 billion proposed in 1993. By letting progrowth tax policies expire, this res-olution reaches deep into the pockets of hard-working families and seeks to reduce the take-home pay of a family of four earning $50,000 by as much as 6 percent. Additionally, this budget ignores the concerns of future generations. Pro-posed tax hikes would slow the econ-omy, and stifle investment and job cre-ation. Since 2003, over 7 million new jobs have been created. The U.S. econ-omy is experiencing 5 uninterrupted years of growth, and since the tax cuts of 2003, the rate of economic growth has more than doubled. Tax increases move us in the wrong direction and that is why I am opposing this budget resolution \u2014because it is wrong for the economy, wrong for hard-working fam-ilies, and wrong for America. Despite the inclusion of funding for several essential programs in this budget resolution, it is imperative that we realize the effect of this proposal as a whole. When we examine closely the entire package, it is clear that the tax increases on Americans included in this budget will serve to stunt our con-tinued economic growth. Therefore, I opposed this budget resolution. We simply cannot afford to appease short- term priorities at the expense of long- term stability and prosperity. The suc-cess of our economy depends on and de-mands from us fair tax policies which enable hard-working Americans to prosper, leading us as a country to fis-cal stability. f HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES SERGEANT WAYNE R . CORNELL Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. Presi- dent, I rise today to honor Army SGT Wayne R. Cornell of Holstein, NE. Sergeant Cornell will be remembered as a dedicated husband and father. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3829 March 27, 2007 Having been deployed to Iraq earlier this year, Sergeant Cornell made cer-tain he would be allowed to take his 2 weeks ' leave in July. He was deter- mined to make it home to Holstein, NE, in time to see his wife Patricia give birth to their third child. With both his father and grandfather having served in the military, enlisting had always been a top priority for Ser-geant Cornell. While at Silver Lake High School in Roseland, no matter what branch of service was making a recruiting visit to his school, Sergeant Cornell was always the first in line to meet with the military recruiter. In addition to his desire to enlist, Ser-geant Cornell was also a skilled mar-tial arts student and is remembered by his teachers as a kindhearted and well- meaning individual. Shortly after graduating from high school in 1999, Sergeant Cornell chose to enlist in the Nebraska Army Na-tional Guard. During 4 years with the Guard, he served twice in Bosnia and once in Afghanistan. In addition to his service to his country, Sergeant Cor-nell also served his community as a volunteer firefighter. Last year he en-listed in the Army; he was deployed to Iraq when called up in February. On March 20, 2007, while serving with the Army 's 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry, 4th Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, based out of Fort Riley, KS, Sergeant Cornell passed away when the vehicle he was traveling in was struck by a roadside bomb in Baghdad. ''He did it all for his family, '' said his wife Patricia. ''He was an awesome fa- ther, and he just made every sacrifice for us. '' In addition to his wife Patri- cia, Sergeant Cornell is survived by his two children, Dameion, 5, and Zoie, 3, of Holstein; mother Patricia Perrie of Holstein; father Larry Cornell of Fair-mont, NE; and sisters Jadeen Cornell of Blue Hill, NE, and Janalle Gowlovech, of Sioux Falls, SD. I offer my sincere condolences to Ser- geant Cornell 's family. Not only did he sacrifice for his family, he made the ul-timate and most courageous sacrifice for his Nation. Every American and all Nebraskans are proud of the service of brave military personnel such as SGT Wayne Cornell. Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. Army SGT Wayne Cornell of Ne-braska. Sergeant Cornell was killed in Baghdad when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. He was 26 years old. Sergeant Cornell grew up in the small town of Holstein, NE. A 1999 graduate of Silver Lake High School, his teachers had little doubt that he would serve his country after gradua-tion. He enlisted with the Army Na-tional Guard soon after graduation and was deployed to Bosnia and Afghani-stan. In 2006, Sergeant Cornell decided to continue his career in the Armed Forces and enlisted with the Regular Army. He was deployed to Iraq in Feb-ruary 2007 with the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Com-bat Team, 1st Infantry Division based at Fort Riley, KS. Sergeant Cornell was a deeply com- mitted father and husband. He always put his family first in the decisions he made. The Army was his means to pro-vide for his family, as well as serve his country. He and his wife Patricia had two children, Dameion and Zoie, and the family is expecting a third child in July. In addition to his wife and children, Sergeant Cornell is survived by his fa-ther Larry Cornell, his mother Patricia Perrie, and sisters Jadeen Cornell and Janalle Gowlovech. I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SGT Wayne Cornell. f MARCH MADNESS Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to spend a few minutes talking about March Madness. Millions of Americans are glued to their tele-visions to watch basketball this time of year, and I want to talk about a No. 1 seed that wasn 't closely followed na- tionwide. Everyone knows how Florida, Georgetown, UCLA, and Ohio State are faring in their tournament games, but the Winona State Warriors may not be on everyone 's radar. Well, they should be. The Warriors set a Division II record by winning 57 straight games over the last two seasons. This breaks the previous record of 52 games which has been intact since 1946. Over this stretch, the Warriors have dominated most teams that they met with the av-erage margin of victory being almost 20 points \u2014including one victory by 81 points. Unfortunately, this streak ended on Saturday as they came just a few points short of winning back-to- back Division II championships when their opponents made a buzzer-beating shot. I commend Coach Mike Leaf for his accomplishments. In the 9 years he has coached at Winona State, he has lead the Warriors to five regular-season Northern Sun Intercollegiate Con-ference titles, four tournament con-ference titles, four Division II tour-nament appearances, and the 2006 na-tional title. He was also named na-tional coach of the year after leading his team to the national championship last year. It takes a great deal to bring to- gether a championship basketball team. Coach Leaf has done this while serving as an inspiration to his players and the entire Winona community. He has taught his players to work hard and enjoy themselves while winning with class. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Coach Leaf, his staff, his players, the students of Winona State, and all the Warrior fans. I look forward to the continued successes of Coach Leaf and his team next year. Go Warriors! S. CON. RES. 21 Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the budget reso-lution that the U.S. Senate adopted last Friday. Every year, Congress considers a budget resolution, setting the Govern-ment 's priorities for the coming year. For the past 2 years since my election to the Senate, I have been compelled to vote against budget resolutions that I believed were out of touch with our fis-cal realities and national priorities. This year, I was proud to support the resolution. I commend the outstanding leader- ship of Chairman C ONRAD , who helped to produce a resolution that makes great progress getting our Nation 's pri- orities back on track. Instead of deep-ening our fiscal hole with irresponsible tax giveaways to the wealthy, this budget makes an important departure from the Republican budgets of the re-cent past and brings our budget back into balance. Instead of gutting pro- grams that help our most vulnerable citizens and communities, this budget allows these programs \u2014like the State Children 's Health Insurance Program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assist-ance Program, Medicare, COPS, and others \u2014to keep serving those who rely on the important moral commitments our Nation has made. Instead of budget gimmicks and deferred responsibility, this budget brings greater trans-parency and responsibility back to Washington. It does so first by reinstating pay-go. In a Democratic Senate, new manda-tory spending, just like new tax cuts, must be paid for by offsetting spending reductions or revenue increases. Pay- go will require tough choices and dif-ficult tradeoffs. We will not be able simply to pass along the debt to future generations for the choices we make today. We will have to be accountable for paying our own bills and collecting our own revenue. Pay-go by itself will not bring our budget back to balance, but it will prevent deficits from getting worse. Pay-go by itself cannot resolve our Nation 's long-term liabilities, but it will restore the budget discipline that has been lacking in Washington for too long. When I travel around the country or talk to families in Illinois, I hear about the same priorities again and again. People from all walks of life \u2014farmers and small businesspeople, teachers and veterans, salespeople and service work-ers, doctors and senior citizens, people prospering and those struggling at the margins \u2014all share a common set of concerns and aspirations. They want affordable health care for themselves and their children. They want a quality education for their children. They want to retire with dignity. They are con-cerned about our national security and our domestic security. Unfortunately, many Americans are not convinced that their voices are heard here in Washington. They are not convinced because the President VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3830 March 27, 2007 proposed a budget that ignores their priorities. They are not convinced be-cause they don 't see enough serious ef- forts to reduce their health care costs or to improve educational opportuni-ties. They are not convinced because it appears that for too long no one in Government has been held accountable for incompetent leadership and neglect of the public interest. Fortunately, the budget resolution we adopted last week responds to their voices. It demonstrates to families across the Nation that we are once again paying attention to their con-cerns. They have a reason to start once again to have confidence in their Gov-ernment. Let me give a few reasons, why I sup- ported this resolution. The failure of our Nation to guar- antee access to affordable health care for children is shameful, and the Presi-dent's budget threatened to worsen the situation for children in working fami-lies. This budget rejects the President 's proposed cuts to the State Children 's Health Insurance Program, extends care to 6 million additional eligible children, and makes children 's health- care a priority for Congress. This budget also makes progress to ensure that preschool children from disadvantaged backgrounds will re-ceive quality care and education; that children, no matter where they go to school, will have an equal opportunity for quality education; and will make college more affordable so that our children can compete in a global mar-ketplace. By rejecting the President 's proposed cuts in education and train-ing, this budget shores up the Federal end of the bargain to support No Child Left Behind and support programs that educate individuals with disabilities. This budget also includes $100 million for grants to establish summer learn-ing programs in local school districts through the Summer Term Education Program. I thank Chairman C ONRAD for his assistance in getting my amend-ment to fund these programs included in the final resolution. These grants will help students in early elementary grades by supporting their participa-tion in 6 weeks of summer school. Teachers tell us that students return to school each September at levels below their successes of the previous spring. Educators know this as ''sum- mer learning loss, '' and research has shown that students, on average, lose more than 1 month of reading skills and 2 months of math skills during the summer. The impact of summer learn-ing loss is greatest for children living in poverty, children with learning dis-abilities, and children who do not speak English at home. The achieve-ment gap in education begins early in life and remains a burden for too many throughout their time in school. The Summer Term Education Program funded by this resolution will help to bridge this gap through structured summer learning opportunities. The security of our Nation at home and abroad is also a critical priority, and honoring our veterans should be considered a sacred obligation. This budget fully funds our defense and homeland security funding needs and respects our duty to support our vet-erans. These brave men and women have sacrificed so much for us and for our Nation. Sadly, as uncovered by the Walter Reed scandal, our Government is failing them. This budget makes it possible to provide the quality health care and services that our veterans de-serve. We cannot ignore the reality that there are financial and human costs to war. This budget recognizes that reality. I am also pleased that the budget res- olution includes an important bipar- tisan amendment that I offered with my colleagues, Senators B UNNING , BINGAMAN , LUGAR , and B OXER , to triple the administration 's recommendation for carbon sequestration. This amend-ment provides an additional $200 mil-lion for Department of Energy efforts on carbon sequestration, for a total of $279 million in that account. Both envi-ronmental groups and the coal indus-try acknowledge the importance of bet-ter technology for carbon sequestra-tion and control. The International Panel on Climate Change, environ-mental groups like NRDC, and the min-ing industry all are on record that the long-term deep geological storage of carbon is possible and is happening now on a small scale. But for it to occur on a far larger scale, we must redouble Federal efforts to make technologies widespread and economical in the next 15 years. A recent report by the Massa-chusetts Institute of Technology rec-ommended a $5 billion program over the next 10 years to achieve that goal. My amendment today provides a sig-nificant increase down that path. Too many Americans say they lack confidence in our tax system because they hear about well-connected indi-viduals and corporations getting away without paying their fair share. I be-lieve this budget will begin to restore the confidence necessary for a fair and effective tax system. Instead of reach-ing deeper into the pockets of hard- working Americans, this budget will collect taxes where taxes are due. This budget calls for strong new measures to close the tax gap, shut down tax scams, and address offshore tax havens. I am proud of my efforts with Senator L EVIN and the Permanent Sub- committee on Investigations to stop tax haven abuses, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the 110th Congress to improve the fairness of our Tax Code. The budget resolution we passed last week demonstrates that we can rise above ideology and gimmicks and begin tackling the serious challenges we face as a nation. It demonstrates that vision matters and leadership matters. I am grateful for Chairman C ONRAD 's extraordinary leadership and the terrific work of his talented, dedi-cated, and hard-working staff. They worked well in committee and on the floor to help assemble a budget resolu- tion that a majority of us in the Sen-ate could vote for in good conscience and with confidence that America 's fis- cal policies have a chance, at long last, to get back on track. f COMMENDING MAJOR GENERAL GALE S. POLLOCK Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Army leadership for selecting the first woman and nurse to serve as the Acting Army Surgeon General. Today, MG Gale S. Pollock, a nurse, is in charge of the Army Medical Department and leading the way in im-proving organizational efficiencies and streamlining the care of our wounded warriors. Major General Pollock was born in Kearny, NJ, and entered the Army Nurse Corps in 1976 after earning her BSN from the Walter Reed Institute of Nursing through the University of Maryland. She also completed a master of business administration from Boston University, a master in health care ad-ministration from Baylor University, and a master in national security and strategy from the National Defense University. Major General Pollock also attended the U.S. Army Nurse Anes-thesia Program and is a certified reg-istered nurse anesthetist, CRNA, and a fellow in the American College of Healthcare Executives. Major General Pollock 's military education includes Senior Service Col-lege at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, the U.S. Air Force War College, the Interagency Institute for Federal Health Care Executives, the Military Health System CAPSTONE program, the Principles of Advanced Nurse Administrators, and the NATO staff officer course. On March 20, 2007, Major General Pol- lock, Chief of the Army Nurse Corps, was officially named Commander of the U.S. Army Medical Command and the Acting Army Surgeon General. Her previous military assignments include, Commander, Pacific Regional Medical Command and Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI; Special Assistant to the Surgeon General for Information Management and Health Policy; Com-mander, Martin Army Community Hos-pital, Fort Benning, GA; Commander, U.S. Army Medical Department Activ-ity, Fort Drum, NY; Staff Officer, Stra-tegic Initiatives Command Group for the Army Surgeon General; Depart-ment of Defense, DoD, Healthcare Ad-visor to the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Tran-sition Assistance; Health Fitness Advi-sor at the National Defense University; Senior Policy Analyst in Health Af-fairs, DoD; and Chief, Anesthesia Nurs-ing Service at Walter Reed Army Med-ical Center, Washington, DC. Major General Pollock brings exten- sive leadership, education, and experi-ence to her new position as the Acting Army Surgeon General. As an Army nurse and woman, I applaud her many VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3831 March 27, 2007 accomplishments which have brought her to the highest level of rank and re-sponsibility in military medicine. f HONORING JASON RAY Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Jason Ray, a young man whose life was tragically cut short this past weekend while with the University of North Carolina bas-ketball team during their trip to the NCAA Tournament games in New Jer-sey. Jason, a 21-year-old native of Con- cord, NC, was set to graduate from UNC-Chapel Hill this May majoring in business administration with a minor in religion. Jason was best known for regularly performing at sporting events as the university 's mascot, ''Rameses. '' He was a member of UNC 's cheerleading squad. I have seen Jason perform at the school 's sporting events. I admired his unmatched school spirit and his ani-mated, energetic interaction with the Tar Heel fans. The University of North Carolina community lost a dear friend in Jason on Monday. However, he left a legacy that will certainly last for the many generations of fans that watched him perform. College basketball holds a special place in North Carolinians ' hearts. Jason 's team spirit and dedica- tion helped make rooting for UNC bas-ketball a community tradition. I send my thoughts and prayers to his family, teammates, classmates, fans, and friends. f COLLEGE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a college basket-ball team that this past weekend won a national title. I am speaking of Barton College in Wilson, NC, which beat the defending champion Winona State to win the Di-vision II Basketball Championship. Through their win, Barton College also ended Winona State 's Division II record 57-game winning streak. Now I have seen a lot of college bas- ketball games over the course of my life, especially representing the State of North Carolina, where basketball is not just a game but a way of life, but this one ranks close to the top when it comes to exciting endings. With only 45 seconds left to play in the game, Barton down by 7 points \u2014a deficit that would be extremely dif-ficult to overcome by any team \u2014and assisted by the stellar performance of his teammates, Barton 's Anthony At- kinson scored an unbelievable 10 points in the remaining 39 seconds, included a buzzer-beating lay-up, to win the Divi-sion II national title by a score of 77 to 75. If you didn 't see the game live, I would suggest you go on the Internet and watch the ending to this fantastic game. It is simply unbelievable and is remi- niscent of Christian Laettner 's game- winning last-second jump shot in Duke 's dramatic 104 to 103 victory over Kentucky in the East regional final of the 1992 NCAA Tournament. For Barton College, a small private school with a student body of only 960 students, this win over Winona State, a relatively large school with an enroll-ment of over 8,000 students, represents a ''David and Goliath '' story for a smalltown North Carolina basketball team. Again, I congratulate the NCAA Divi- sion II National Champion Barton Bull-dogs and head coach Ron Lievense on an extremely exciting end to an ex-traordinary season. f BIOFUELS FOR ENERGY SECURITY AND TRANSPORTATION ACT Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, over 18 months ago, the President signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The enactment of that legislation was a watershed event in structuring sound energy policy for this Nation 's future. One of the linchpins of that act is its commitment to the development of ethanol and other alternative fuels that will move us toward greater en-ergy security by displacing foreign sources of energy for our transpor-tation fuels. Since EPACT was enacted, we have seen a surge of interest in the develop-ment of infrastructure for production and distribution of ethanol and other biofuels. I am proud that the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is greatly responsible for that. EPACT is creating American energy and American jobs in America 's heartland. Just as I am proud of the new world of alternative fuels created in EPACT, I am also very proud of the bill Senator B INGAMAN and I have introduced to build on the renewable fuels provisions of that Act \u2014the Biofuels for Energy Security and Transportation Act, the BEST Act \u2014of 2007. The Energy Policy Act established the first renewable fuels standard, which required the production of 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol annually by the year 2012. Private industry re-sponded, and today we are on course to exceeding significantly the levels set in the Energy. Since August 2005, con-struction has begun on more than 70 new ethanol biorefineries, creating more than 160,000 new jobs, and last year, this country produced nearly 5 billion gallons of ethanol. Building on that success, the BEST Act that Senator B INGAMAN and I have introduced increases the renewable fuels standard, RFS \u2014beginning at a level of 8.5 billion gallons next year and increasing to 36 billion gallons in 2022. We get this ambitious RFS with the understanding that promotion and enhancement of advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol, will be es-sential to making this new goal a re-ality. In his recent State of the Union speech, the President laid out an ambi-tious but worthy goal to reduce our consumption of gasoline by 20 percent in 10 years. The President envisioned biofuels as a key component to meet-ing this goal. In addition to imple-menting the 2005 Energy Bill, the BEST Act is another step, and a very significant one, in achieving that mark. By increasing our production and consumption of biofuels in the United States, we can decrease our re-liance on foreign oil, while at the same time creating American jobs in a grow-ing biofuels industry. To complement the increase in the renewable fuels standard, our bill in-cludes several measures to help pro-mote the establishment of a biofuels infrastructure, including grants to States and localities to build biofuels corridors. Another enhancement to speed pro- duction and distribution of these fuels is Federal loan guarantees specifically for these projects. I am pleased that we appear to be getting on the right path to implementing a significant loan guarantee program as envisioned in the title 17 of EPACT. This provision is ab-solutely essential to starting up some of the domestic clean energy invest-ments we so urgently need to ensure our energy security. The BEST Act fur-ther refines those provisions to reflect the realities of commercial project fi-nance. Finally, the bill increases our invest- ment in bioenergy research and devel-opment by 50 percent. This research is essential to developing methods to produce advanced biofuels, such as cel-lulosic ethanol, that we will need to meet our long-term goals. Several weeks ago, Senator B INGA- MAN and I sponsored a biofuels con- ference in the Energy and Natural Re-sources Committee to explore all of the issues related to this important piece of our energy policy. We heard from numerous government and private sec-tor scientists, industry project devel-opers, and the financial community. We explored every facet of the issues related to increased biofuels produc-tion and development. The BEST Act we have introduced is the culmination of our deliberations. I am very pleased with this effort and hopeful that it will be every bit as successful as the effort we spawned in the 2005 Energy bill. f ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS RETIREMENT OF JOE DART Mr. KERRY. Mr. President. I honor a great and dedicated American, Joseph A. Dart, who for almost 30 years has championed the rights of workers across Massachusetts. As he prepares for a well-deserved retirement, I am grateful to be able to pay tribute to this wonderful man and give him the recognition he deserves for touching the lives of so many. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3832 March 27, 2007 Joe has spent his career bringing real meaning to the American dream. As president of the Massachusetts Build-ing Trades Council, AFL -CIO, and ex- ecutive vice president of the Massachu-setts AFL -CIO, Joe advocates for the rights of more than 75,000 construction trades men and women throughout the Commonwealth. Joe has fought for, and defended, the right to collective bargaining and the empowerment that it has brought to working families throughout our his-tory. Joe helped write competitive bid laws for public construction projects, helped to pass the OSHA 10-hour law which requires all construction work-ers on public projects to undergo safety training, and helped to pass a law strengthening wage enforcement. Throughout his years in public serv- ice, Joe has negotiated dozens of agree-ments to guarantee fair, competitive wages, a reasonable work week, and safe working conditions on billions of dollars of construction projects throughout the Commonwealth. I am most fortunate to have had his support, friendship, and counsel throughout many campaigns and many years in office here in Massachusetts. An exemplary community leader, Joe has worked tirelessly to uphold the rights of thousands of Massachusetts workers who entrusted him with this office. Massachusetts is grateful for the service he has provided. Countless fam-ilies in Massachusetts are living better, safer lives because of Joe Dart and his commitment to organized labor. On behalf of workers throughout our State, I am proud to honor him for his selfless dedication to countless works across the Commonwealth. f RECOGNIZING DR. LEN PETERS Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a great contributor to the State of Washington and to the na-tional science and education commu-nities. Dr. Len Peters recently stepped down as the Director of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, WA. Fortunately, Dr. Peters has agreed to remain in Richland, working for Battelle Memorial Insti-tute to help promote and build edu-cation and community projects. PNNL, a DOE national laboratory, experienced tremendous growth during Dr. Peters ' tenure. The lab added 330 new members to its world-class staff, enabling the facility to better serve the Nation in the areas of renewable en-ergy, national security, and environ-mental research. Dr. Peters led the staff in enhancing relationships with a number of research universities in the region, continuing his commitment to quality public-private relationships in the interest of furthering math and science education. Dr. Peters came to PNNL in 2003, after serving as the vice provost for re-search at Virginia Polytechnic Insti-tute and State University. Prior to guiding Virginia Tech 's ambitious re- search portfolio, he served as acting vice president for research and grad-uate studies at the University of Ken-tucky. Dr. Peters spent nearly 20 years in the classroom, educating our next generation of scientists. He is a distin-guished scholar and a leader in the field of atmospheric chemistry. In his new role at Battelle, Dr. Peters will continue to serve Washington State through community outreach programs. His work to expand higher education opportunities in the Tri-Cit-ies, as well as his leadership on the Hanford Reach Interpretive Center Board are examples of his strong com-mitment to building a better commu-nity, region and State. I thank Dr. Len Peters for his guid- ance and commitment to PNNL over the past 3 12years. For the people of Washington State and the entire Pa-cific Northwest region, I thank Dr. Pe-ters for his continued service to our community and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. f MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE At 12:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate: H.R. 137.

Whereas, U.S. Senators Boxer and Fein- stein have introduced S. 151 to prohibit new oil and gas leasing in federal waters off Cali-fornia; and VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May S3833 March 27, 2007 Whereas, California 's 1,100 mile coastline, with its beautiful beaches, wild cliffs, abun-dant fish stocks and fragile environment is a national treasure and a valuable state re-source, which is at the heart of a tourist in-dustry that generates nearly five billion dol-lars in state and local taxes each year; and is the heart of the state 's $43 billion ocean economy; and Whereas, the citizens of California have long opposed new oil and gas drilling off their coastline and support protecting the fragile and valuable coastal environment over development of the relatively small amounts of oil and gas offshore California; and Whereas, California initiated protection of its coast from oil and gas development when the California Legislature in 1955 and 1963, prohibited oil and gas leasing in the State waters off Monterey and Santa Cruz counties and portions of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Humboldt, and Mendocino Counties; and Whereas, the California State Lands Com- mission has not issued any offshore oil and gas lease for new areas since the 1969 spill from a well in Federal waters off Santa Bar-bara that released over three million gallons of crude oil, coating Santa Barbara County 's ocean beaches; and Whereas, the California Legislature con- tinued the State 's efforts to restrict oil and development in its own waters by enacting the California Coastal Sanctuary Act in 1994, which codified the Commission 's earlier ad- ministrative prohibition of new offshore leases and created a statutory statewide coastal sanctuary that prohibits future oil and gas leasing in all State coastal waters, from Mexico to the Oregon border, in per-petuity; and Whereas, the U.S. Congress has protected California coastline from expanded offshore drilling for more than twenty years, renew-ing this protection in the form of a legisla-tive moratorium contained in the annual ap-propriations bill for the Department of the Interior; and Whereas, the need for new oil development can be reduced by improving automobile fuel efficiency and energy efficiency, utilizing and further researching renewable energy and alternative fuels, and fully funding en-ergy conservation and efficiency programs, including solar and renewables, weatheriza-tion, and other initiatives; thus increasing energy independence and reducing the reli-ance on foreign oil; and Whereas, in spite of the steady opposition to new oil and gas leasing off California, var-ious proposals have been made in the last five years to end the federal moratorium or to take steps, such as oil and gas inven-tories, that are intended to lead to new leas-ing; and Whereas, the Commission has adopted six resolutions since 2001 supporting the existing moratorium on new federal leases and oppos-ing the new initiatives to open the California coast to new oil and gas development and leases; and Whereas, S. 151, recently introduced by Senator 's Boxer and Feinstein would perma- nently ban new oil and gas leasing in federal waters, consistent with the state 's own pro- hibition of new leasing in state waters; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the California State Lands Com- mission, That it supports S. 151 and the prohi- bition it proposes for new oil and gas leases in federal waters off California and urges Congress to adopt this measure; and be it further Resolved, That the Congress of the United States and the Federal government be en-couraged to explore options to increase en-ergy independence and reduce reliance on foreign oil, such as incentives to improve en- ergy efficiency, requirements to improve automobile fuel efficiency, provide funding for research into renewable energy and alter-native fuels, and fully funding energy con-servation and efficiency; and be it further Resolved, That the Commission 's Executive Officer transmit copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the United States, to the Governor of California, to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, to the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, to the Chairs and Rank-ing Minority Members of the House Com-mittee on Natural Resources, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and the Senate Committee on En-vironment and Public Works and to each Senator and Representative from California in the Congress of the United States. POM -50. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan urging Congress to enact the Great Lakes Asian Carp Barrier Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. H OUSE RESOLUTION NO. 17 Whereas, two species of Asian carp are on the verge of invading the Great Lakes. Silver carp and bighead carp have advanced up the Mississippi River since their escape from southern fish farms in the early 1980s, and now have been identified within miles of Lake Michigan in the Illinois River near Chi-cago; and Whereas, Asian carp pose a significant risk to the ecology and economy of the Great Lakes region. Asian carp can grow as large as 100 pounds and are voracious feeders. They compete with native fish for food and de-grade water quality by disturbing sediments. They could become a dominant species in the Great Lakes, threatening a $4.5 billion com-mercial and recreational fishery. Silver carp can also jump up to 10 feet out of the water when disturbed, posing a risk to recreational boaters; and Whereas, Asian carp are the latest in a long line of exotic species to threaten the Great Lakes. Over 180 exotic species have in-vaded the Great Lakes since European set-tlement. The most harmful exotic species, zebra mussels and sea lampreys, have cost an estimated $100 million per year to control during the 1990s. Scientists project that Asian carp could have a similar impact on the Great Lakes; and Whereas, the only thing preventing the movement of Asian carp into the Great Lakes is a temporary electrical barrier in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal oper-ated by the United States Army Corps of En-gineers. In addition, the Army Corps and the state of Illinois are constructing a perma-nent electrical barrier to replace the tem-porary barrier; and Whereas, to date, over $12 million has been spent on construction and operation of the electrical barriers. To help match federal funding, the state of Michigan has contrib-uted nearly $70,000 toward the completion of the permanent electrical barrier; and Whereas, current funding is insufficient to complete construction of the permanent bar-rier and only finances operation of the tem-porary barrier through the first half of fiscal year 2007. In addition, there is no funding to renovate the temporary barrier as a perma-nent backup to the new barrier; and Whereas, The Great Lakes Asian Carp Bar- rier Act (H.R. 553 and S. 336) would provide funds to upgrade the current barrier and complete construction of the permanent bar-rier; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives , That we memorialize the United States Con-gress to enact the Great Lakes Asian Carp Barrier Act (H.R. 553 and S. 336) to protect the Great Lakes from Asian carp; and be it further Resolved , That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional dele-gation. POM -51. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of Kentucky urging Congress to repeal the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision; to the Committee on Finance. H OUSE RESOLUTION NO. 45 Whereas, the intent of Congress in the en- actment of the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and the Windfall Elimination Provi-sion (WEP) was to protect the Social Secu-rity program and eliminate perceived abuses in the payment of dual benefits to certain beneficiaries; and Whereas, the GPO and WEP, have resulted in devastating, unintended consequences for hundreds of thousands of teachers and other public employees nationwide; and Whereas, the GPO affects teachers and other public employees in Kentucky and other states who are participants in public retirement systems but who do not partici-pate in the Social Security retirement pro-gram; and Whereas, under the GPO, a teacher who re- ceives benefits under the Kentucky Teach-ers' Retirement System will suffer at least a two-thirds reductions in the Social Security survivor benefits the teacher would other-wise receive from a spouse 's private-sector earnings; and Whereas, teachers in fifteen states, includ- ing Kentucky, do not participate in the So-cial Security program; and Whereas, the WEP reduces the Social Secu- rity benefits of a teacher or other public em-ployee who has participated and received earnings sufficient to qualify for Social Se-curity retirement benefits as well as the ben-efits procured under the Kentucky Teachers ' Retirement System or other public retire-ment system; and Whereas, the GPO and WEP unfairly target public employees, especially our highly val-ued teachers who sacrifice lucrative earnings in the private sector to educate our children; and Whereas, Kentucky has a significant teach- er shortage and loses more than 2000 teach-ers annually to retirement and must actively recruit new teachers to meet growing enroll-ment demands; and Whereas, a federal proposal to repel both the GPO and WEP, the Social Security Fair-ness Act of 2007, has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate and clearly indicates an awareness and acknowledgment of the devastating im-pact of these provisions on teachers and other public employees; Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Kentucky urges the Congress of the United States to enact the Social Security Fairness Act of 2007 or simi-lar legislation to repeal the GPO and WEP provisions of the Social Security law. Section 2. The Clerk of the House of Rep- resentatives shall transmit copies of this Resolution to the President and Vice Presi-dent of the United States to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Ma-jority Floor Leader of the U.S. Senate, and VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3834 March 27, 2007 to each Senator and Representative from the Commonwealth of Kentucky in the Congress of the United States. POM -52. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan urging the President and Congress to appropriate additional funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program; to the Committee on Health, Edu-cation, Labor, and Pensions. H OUSE RESOLUTION NO. 33 Whereas, Home heating is a fundamental necessity in northern climate states during the months from October through March, However, low-income households in Michi-gan and across the nation struggle to pay for this basic necessity. High energy bills in winter force many low-income households into difficult situations, such as forgoing medicine or food in order to pay energy bills or putting themselves in danger by using stoves and portable heaters to provide warmth; and Whereas, In the early 1980s, Congress rec- ognized the need for heating and other home energy assistance when it enacted legislation to create the Low Income Home Energy As-sistance Program (LIHEAP). The LIHEAP program has become a crucial safety net for low-income households and families across the nation, especially in northern climate states. LIHEAP assistance has helped mil-lions of families keep their homes at safe and healthy temperatures; and Whereas, Last year Congress appropriated a record level $3.2 billion in LIHEAP funding. In spite of this, only a fraction of eligible low income households received assistance. According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, last winter only 15 percent of 38 million eligible low-in-come households actually received assist-ance from the LIHEAP program; and Whereas, This year, with the adoption of a September 29th, continuing resolution, Con-gress has appropriated only $1.98 billion for LIHEAP. The President 's proposed FY 2008 budget calls for funding to be reduced fur-ther to $1.78 billion. Under these funding pro-posals, it is estimated that Michigan will re-ceive as much as $47 million dollars less than last year. This will surely mean that state energy assistance programs will be forced to shut down programs and turn needy people away. Last year, even with the record level funding, only 35 percent of eligible low-in-come households in Michigan received LIHEAP assistance; and Whereas, such inadequate LIHEAP funding could be disastrous for Michigan. The state is struggling through one of the nation 's worst economic situations. Currently, nearly one third of Michigan households are at or below 60 percent of the state 's median in- come, and the unemployment rate, which is already much higher than the national aver-age, keeps growing. Clearly, such tough eco-nomic times coupled with a cold, harsh win-ter, and high heating fuel prices, make LIHEAP funding vital for the state of Michi-gan; now, therefore be it Resolved by the House of Representatives. That we urge the President and the Congress of the United States to immediately increase funding for LIHEAP to at least last year 's level of $3.2 billion; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the Office of the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation. POM -53. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan urging Congress to enact the Employee Free Choice Act; to the Com-mittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. H OUSE RESOLUTION NO. 21 Whereas, In 1935, the United States estab- lished, by law, that workers must be free to form unions. The freedom to form or join a union is internationally recognized as a fun-damental human right; and Whereas, Union membership provides workers better wages and benefits, and pro-tection from discrimination and unsafe workplaces. Unions benefit communities by strengthening tax bases, promoting equal treatment, and enhancing civic participa-tion; and Whereas, Even though on paper America 's workers have the freedom to choose for themselves whether to have a union, in re-ality, workers across the nation are rou-tinely denied that right. More than 40 mil-lion United States workers say they would join a union now if they had the opportunity; and Whereas, When the right of workers to form a union is violated, wages fall, race and gender pay gaps widen, workplace discrimi-nation increases, and job safety standards disappear; and Whereas, Many thousands of workers in our country are routinely threatened, co-erced, or fired each year because they try to form a union. Most violations of workers ' freedom to choose a union occur behind closed doors, and each year millions of dol-lars are spent to frustrate workers ' efforts to form unions; and Whereas, A worker 's fundamental right to choose a union is a public issue that requires a public policy solution, including legislative remedies; and Whereas, The Employee Free Choice Act (H.R. 800) has been introduced in the United States Congress in order to restore workers ' freedom to join a union; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we memorialize the United States Con-gress to enact the Employee Free Choice Act, which would authorize the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union as the bargaining representative when a major-ity of employees voluntarily sign authoriza-tions designating that union to represent them; provide for first contract mediation and, arbitration; and establish meaningful penalties for violations of a worker 's free- dom to choose a union; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation. POM -54. A resolution adopted by the Sen- ate of the Legislature of the State of Michi-gan urging the President and Congress to in-crease funding for the Low Income Home En-ergy Assistance Program and to facilitate the establishment of programs that provide information about responsible energy use; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. S ENATE RESOLUTION NO. 10 Whereas, Each winter, public and private programs offering help to low-income fami-lies trying to heat their homes usually find their budgets stretched thin; and Whereas, Fortunately, there is a federally funded program that provides energy assist-ance to low-income households. The Low In-come Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a federal block grant program that provides billions of dollars annually to help low-income households pay energy bills. LIHEAP funds have averted numerous trage-dies by enabling needy families to keep their homes at healthy and safe temperatures dur-ing the bitter cold months of winter; and Whereas, Utility companies, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations often make information available to low-income families to help reduce their heating bills. Such information often recognizes the need for reducing home energy costs through the use of conservation technologies and flexible bill payment practices designed to help em-power low-income consumers to pay their utility bills on a discounted basis; and Whereas, Coordinated and efficient con- sumer education programs of federal, state, and local agencies could help consumers take responsibility for their winter heating bills. Educational programming on things such as how to set proper temperatures in the home, the use of programmable thermo-stats, tips on household budgeting, how to weatherize a home, and energy efficiency training could better prepare low-income households with the skills needed to control their winter heating costs; and Whereas, The President 's proposed budget for next year would reduce the percentage of eligible needy families that receive LIHEAP assistance. The President is requesting only $1.782 billion for LIHEAP in FY 2008. This is far less than the $5.1 billion that is author-ized for the program under the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and a dramatic 44 percent reduction from FY 2006 funding levels. Ac-cording to the National Energy Assistance Directors ' Association (NEADA), the Presi- dent's proposed cut to LIHEAP would force states to eliminate energy assistance to more than a million households; and Whereas, The President 's proposal would hit Michigan particularly hard. No other northern climate state is suffering through such tough economic times. Michigan fin-ished last year with one of the nation 's worst unemployment rates, second only to Mis-sissippi. Since 2003, the unemployment rate in Michigan has exceeded the national rate by an ever-widening margin. As the number of unemployed persons in the state grows, so, too, does the number of households seeking energy assistance. In spite of this, under the President 's proposal, it is estimated that the state would receive nearly $50 million less than it did last year. Clearly, we should edu-cate customers on how to use energy wisely and we should adequately fund the LIHEAP program to ensure that low-income families in Michigan and across the nation receive the help they need during the bitter cold months of winter; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate, That we memori- alize the President and the Congress of the United States, particularly the Michigan congressional delegation and the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, to do all they can to provide additional fund-ing for the Low Income Home Energy Assist-ance Program and facilitate the establish-ment of programs that provide information on responsible energy use; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the Office of the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation. f REPORTS OF COMMITTEES The following reports of committees were submitted: By Mr. INOUYE, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, with an amendment in the nature of a sub-stitute: S. 39.

A bill to establish the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation under the authorities of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961; to the Committee on For-eign Relations. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have spoken many times about one of our Nation 's greatest public servants, the late Senator Paul Simon. He was an honorable man who devoted his life to working for the public good. In the months before his untimely death, Senator Simon returned to Washington to talk to his former col-leagues about the need to strengthen our Nation 's international under- standing and our ability to remain a world leader in the 21st century. His desire to promote peace and security through mutual understanding and sensitivity to the rest of the world was borne out of the tragic events of Sep-tember 11, 2001. Senator Simon struggled with the question of how America could lead when so few of our citizens have the proper knowledge and understanding of the world beyond our borders. He knew that America 's security, global com- petitiveness, and diplomatic efforts in working towards a peaceful society rest on our young people 's global com- petence and ability to appreciate lan-guages and cultural and social realities beyond what they may have experi-enced in the United States. He envi-sioned a United States populated by a generation of Americans with a greater knowledge and understanding of the world \u2014a generation of our Nation 's fu- ture leaders that have been abroad and have a personal connection to another part of the world. Senator Simon 's tireless efforts led to Congress 's establishment of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Com-mission. I was honored to serve on this bipartisan Commission, and it was a privilege for me to introduce legisla-tion last year that brought Senator Si-mon's dream one step closer to reality. The bill, based on the Commission 's recommendations, would have estab-lished a study abroad program for un-dergraduate students that would help build global awareness and inter-national understanding. I am once again proud to stand here today and introduce legislation that embodies Senator Simon 's vision. The bill has been renamed the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act so that all future generations will re-member Senator Simon 's commitment to international education. The goal of this legislation remains the same: to encourage and support the experience of studying abroad in devel-oping countries \u2014in countries whose people, culture, language, government, and religion might be very different from ours. This bill aims to have at least 1 million undergraduate students study abroad annually within 10 years and to expand study abroad opportuni-ties for students who are currently underrepresented. The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act would estab-lish study abroad as a national priority and provide the catalyst for the edu-cation community to commit to mak-ing study abroad an institutional pri-ority. This legislation would create an inde- pendent public-private entity, the Sen-ator Paul Simon Foundation, that would award grants to carry out the goal of making study abroad in high- quality programs in diverse locations around the world the routine, rather than the exception, for college stu-dents. Students who were previously unable to study abroad due to financial constraints would be eligible for grants. Grants also would provide col-leges, universities and nongovern-mental institutions with the financial incentive to develop programs that make it easier for college students to study abroad. The future of our country depends on having globally literate citizens \u2014those who are able to look at other points of view and incorporate those ideas into their thinking and manner of inter-acting with others. I have shared this VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3838 March 27, 2007 Paul Simon quote before, and I will do so again because it is the most poign-ant example of Paul 's vision in his own words: A nation cannot drift into greatness. We must dream, and we must be willing to make small sacrifices to achieve those dreams. This major national initiative can lift our vision and responsiveness to the rest of the world. I ask my colleagues to join with me and with Senator C OLEMAN in support of this legislation and to see to it that Senator Paul Simon 's dream of build- ing a stronger and more culturally aware nation is realized. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 991 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act of 2007''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) According to President George W. Bush, ''America 's leadership and national security rest on our commitment to educate and pre-pare our youth for active engagement in the international community. ''. (2) According to former President William J. Clinton, ''Today, the defense of United States interests, the effective management of global issues, and even an understanding of our Nation 's diversity require ever-greater contact with, and understanding of, people and cultures beyond our borders. ''. (3) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appro-priations and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108 -199). Pursuant to its man- date, the Commission has submitted to Con-gress and the President a report of its rec-ommendations for greatly expanding the op-portunity for students at institutions of higher education in the United States to study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing nations. (4) Studies consistently show that United States students score below their counter-parts in other advanced countries on indica-tors of international knowledge. This lack of global literacy is a national liability in an age of global trade and business, global interdependence, and global terror. (5) By numbers ranging from 77 to more than 90 percent, Americans believe that it is important for their children to learn other languages, study abroad, attend a college where they can interact with international students, learn about other countries and cultures, and generally be prepared for the global age, according to a December 2005 na-tional survey commissioned by NAFSA: As-sociation of International Educators. (6) In today 's world, it is more important than ever for the United States to be a re-sponsible, constructive leader that other countries are willing to follow. Such leader-ship cannot be sustained without an in-formed citizenry with much more knowledge and awareness of the world than most Amer-icans currently possess. (7) Study abroad has proven to be a very ef- fective means of imparting international and foreign-language competency to students. (8) In any given year, only approximately one percent of all students enrolled in United States institutions of higher education study abroad. (9) Less than 10 percent of the students who graduate from United States institu-tions of higher education with bachelors de-grees have studied abroad. (10) Far more study abroad must take place in the developing countries. Ninety- five percent of the world 's population growth over the next 50 years will occur outside of Europe. Yet in the academic year 2004 -2005, 60 percent of United States students study-ing abroad studied in Europe, and 45 percent studied in four countries \u2014the United King- dom, Italy, Spain, and France \u2014according to the Institute of International Education. (11) The Final Report of the National Com- mission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (The 9/11 Commission Report) recommended that the United States in-crease support for ''scholarship, exchange, and library programs ''. The 9/11 Public Dis- course Project, successor to the 9/11 Commis-sion, noted in its November 14, 2005, status report that this recommendation was ''unfulfilled, '' and stated that ''The U.S. should increase support for scholarship and exchange programs, our most powerful tool to shape attitudes over the course of a gen-eration. ''. In its December 5, 2005, Final Re- port on the 9/11 Commission Recommenda-tions, the 9/11 Public Discourse Project gave the government a grade of ''D'' for its imple- mentation of this recommendation. (12) Investing in a national study abroad program would help turn a grade of ''D'' into an ''A'' by equipping United States students to communicate United States values and way of life through the unique dialogue that takes place among citizens from around the world when individuals study abroad. SEC. 3. PURPOSES. The purposes of this Act are \u2014 (1) to significantly enhance the global competitiveness and international knowl-edge base of the United States by ensuring that more students in United States institu-tions of higher education have the oppor-tunity to acquire foreign language skills and international knowledge through signifi-cantly expanded study abroad; (2) to enhance the foreign policy capacity of the United States by significantly expand-ing and diversifying the talent pool of indi-viduals with non-traditional foreign lan-guage skills and cultural knowledge in the United States who are available for recruit-ment by United States foreign affairs agen-cies, legislative branch agencies, and non-governmental organizations involved in for-eign affairs activities; (3) to ensure that an increasing portion of study abroad by United States students will take place in nontraditional study abroad destinations such as the People 's Republic of China, countries of the Middle East region, and developing countries; and (4) to create greater cultural under- standing of the United States by exposing foreign students and their families to Amer-ican students in countries that have not tra-ditionally hosted large numbers of American students.

By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. INHOFE , Mr. L AUTENBERG , Mr. ALEXANDER , Mrs. , Ms. KLOBUCHAR , and Mr. C RAIG): S. 992. A bill to achieve emission re- ductions and cost savings through ac-celerated use of cost-effective lighting technologies in public buildings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the ''Public Buildings Cost Reduction Act of 2007. '' I am joined by my Environment and Public Works Committee colleagues Senators I NHOFE , LAUTENBERG K LOBUCHAR . This bill will reduce air pollution and save taxpayer money by accelerating the use of cost-effec-tive technologies that reduce energy use in public buildings. The goal of this legislation is to have the government lead by example. This bill will help to ensure less polluting and more cost-effective General Serv-ices Administration, or GSA, buildings. Under this legislation, the GSA, which is the Nation 's largest public real es- tate organization, must establish a program to speed the use of cost-effec-tive and energy-efficient technology and other actions, called ''cost-effec- tive technologies and practices '', in its buildings. GSA also must assure that a manager is named who is responsible for accelerating the use of cost-effec-tive technologies and practices for each GSA building. In addition, the GSA must review current and available highly-efficient lighting within 90 days, and complete a plan within 6 months for installing highly-efficient lighting in GSA build-ings. Within 1 year after enactment, GSA must issue a detailed timetable to replace all existing inefficient lighting in GSA buildings as quickly as feasible, within 5 years, using available funds. A second provision in the bill re- quires GSA to complete a broader plan that will: (1) achieve a 20-percent re-duction in operating costs at GSA fa-cilities to the maximum extent feasible within 5 years after enactment through the application of cost-effective, highly efficient technologies and practices, using available funds; (2) describe the current and needed funding for these programs and any issues that may in-hibit their implementation; (3) rec-ommend uniform standards for federal agencies for highly efficient tech-nologies; and (4) recommend ways to allow federal agencies to keep their savings from using efficient tech-nologies and practices, to use them for additional investments and other pur-poses. The bill also creates an EPA grant program to help local governments make their buildings more efficient. This $20 million per year matching grant program at EPA will help local governments renovate their buildings to make them more cost-effective and energy efficient. The grant program will require a 40 percent match from the local government, and will require grantees to show they will cut utility bills by 40 percent through renovations of a building or buildings that use highly efficient technologies and prac-tices. Further, EPA will have to verify the efficiency and savings and issue guidelines for the program. Grants of up to $1 million will be allowed. In ad-dition, the bill requires reports to Con-gress on progress under the program, savings achieved, and recommenda-tions. I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 992 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. D ODD): S. 993. A bill to improve pediatric re- search; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pediatric Re-search Improvement Act, legislation to reauthorize the Pediatric Rule and ex-tend it permanently. I believe that doing so is critically important to en-sure that the drugs designed for chil-dren are safe and effective for children. This legislation will result in better health outcomes for our children, grandchildren, and many generations of children to come. In 1998, the FDA issued a regulation called the pediatric rule, which allowed the agency to require companies to perform pediatric clinical trials on medications used by children. It is im-portant to note that this requirement does not slow the drug approval proc-ess. If a drug is not likely to be used in the pediatric population, it is not sub-ject to this testing. Companies can also apply for a deferral, so that they can perform necessary tests after a drug has been approved and is being used in the adult population. In October 2002, a U.S. District Court found that the FDA had exceeded its statutory authority when it promul-gated the Pediatric Rule, and that Con-gress needed to explicitly award the FDA the power to require these clinical trials. In response, I worked with my col- leagues in Congress to pass the Pedi-atric Research Equity Act, legislation that codified the Pediatric Rule, and which was signed into law on December 3, 2003. Since 2003, over 100 drugs have been evaluated under PREA \u2014and since 1998, more than 1,000 drugs have fallen under the authority of the pediatric rule. The legislation has successfully resulted in increased pediatric evaluations. We 've been able to collect data on drugs com-monly used in children \u2014like azithromycin, an antibiotic used to treat bronchitis, pneumonia, and other respiratory infections \u2014as well as drugs that may not be so commonly used, but that help keep children alive, like emtriva, one of the newer drugs we have to treat AIDS. But unless we act to reauthorize this legislation now, the pediatric rule is set to sunset on September 30 of this year, placing in jeopardy the ability of the agency to require these safeguards for our children. In order to address this, I am intro- ducing the Pediatric Research Im-provement Act to remove the sunset for the pediatric rule, so that we will never again be in danger of losing the authority to make sure that the drugs designed for children are safe for chil-dren. In addition to making the rule per- manent, this reauthorization would do the following: Improves Coordination between Pedi- atric Specialists and Others at the FDA. In order to improve coordination with the pediatric exclusivity provi-sions of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), PRIA would ex-pand an internal FDA committee to re-view all issues of pediatric-related la-beling and assessments. Doing so en-sures that a drug that falls under PRIA or BPCA is reviewed not only by ex-perts for that particular drug, but those with pediatric expertise. Streamlines the process for obtaining pediatric data on already-marketed drugs. If a company chooses not to pur-sue pediatric exclusivity for an already marketed drug under the Best Pharma-ceuticals for Children Act, the Sec-retary has the authority to require the submission of pediatric data for the drug. This authority has never been utilized, in part due to the lengthy ad-ministrative process required. PRIA would streamline this administrative process and help get essential data on drugs for which it is vitally needed, while preserving the ability of compa-nies to have a fair review of the agen-cy's decisions. Increases Data about the Use and Ap- plicability of PRIA. PRIA would re-quire two reports \u2014one from the Insti- tute of Medicine and one from the GAO\u2014that would allow us to have bet- ter data on the number and ways in which the pediatric rule is used, and evaluate its contributions to ensuring overall pediatric drug safety. This legislation is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, Eliz-abeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Founda-tion, Ambulatory Pediatric Associa-tion, American Pediatric Society, As-sociation of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs, and the Society for Pediatric Research. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to pass this vital piece of legislation as quickly as possible, and help to ensure that our pediatricians and other health profes-sionals have the tools they need to pro-vide safe and effective treatment to our Nation 's children. By Mr. TESTER (for himself and Mr. S ALAZAR ): S. 994. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to eliminate the deductible and change the method of determining the mileage reimburse-ment rate under the beneficiary travel program administered by the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and for other pur-poses; to the Committee on Veterans ' Affairs. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce legislation that will go a long ways toward meeting our Nation 's obligations to our rural vet- erans. The Disabled Fairness Act will make a real improvement in the lives of America 's rural veterans \u2014more than 17,000 of whom live in my State. For many veterans who live far from a VA hospital or community health center, transportation remains the sin-gle biggest obstacle to care. Today, dis-abled veterans are eligible to have only a small fraction of their transportation costs reimbursed. They must pay the first $18 per month out of their own pocket. And after that, they receive re-imbursement at the rate of just 11 cents per mile \u2014less than one-quarter of the current rate of 48.5 cents per mile for Government employees. The reimbursement rate has not been changed since 1977. That is unaccept-able. In Montana, we have several very good VA health clinics, as well as one of the best hospitals in the VA system, the Ft. Harrison Hospital in Helena. But the smaller clinics simply cannot provide all the services that Ft. Har-rison offers. That is no complaint against these clinics, it is just a fact. So when a disabled veteran in my State gets in his car and drives 200 miles from Havre to the Ft. Harrison VA hospital in Helena to receive treat-ment for an injury he suffered while de-fending our country, he will be reim-bursed $4. On the way back, he will be eligible to be reimbursed $22. That is $26 total for a trip that the Federal Government estimates will actually cost $194. That is a slap in the face to someone whose life has been fundamen-tally altered by the wounds they suf-fered on the field of battle. In the last month, AAA reports that the price of gas in Montana has in-creased 36 cents over the last month. That means disabled veterans are spending much more of their own money to get to a VA hospital, espe-cially in places like Montana, where a trip to the hospital can mean a journey of hundreds of miles. The Disabled Veterans Fairness Act ends this practice. My bill repeals the $18 per month deductible that disabled veterans must satisfy before they can be eligible for reimbursement for mile-age traveled to and from a VA hospital for treatment. The bill also raises the reimbursement rate from the current level of 11 cents per mile to the pre-vailing rate for Federal employees, as determined by the General Services Administration. I also want to thank Senator S ALAZAR for his advice on this legisla- tion. I am proud to have him as a co-sponsor. He has worked so hard to im-prove the lives of rural veterans, and I look forward to supporting his efforts in the coming months as well. By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. B OXER ): S. 996. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to expand pas-senger facility fee eligibility for cer-tain noise compatibility projects; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to allow the Los Angeles World Airports VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, 27, 2007 to provide the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts, which lie directly in the Los Angeles International Air-port's flight path, with noise reduction funds. This bill would authorize the Los An- geles World Airports to allow the use of passenger facility fees for noise reduc-tion projects at these schools. In 1980, the Lennox School District and the City of Los Angeles settled a lawsuit, allowing aircraft carrying up to 40 million people per year to fly overhead the schools. The City also agreed to provide approximately $2.5 million to the Lennox School District. Currently, an airplane flies a few hundred feet above the Lennox and Inglewood schools about every three minutes. The noise is deafening. It rat-tles windows, disrupts lessons, and makes it very difficult for these stu-dents to learn. In February 2005, the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts settled a lawsuit with the Los Angeles World Airports under which the Los Angeles International Airport agreed to provide the School Districts with more than $110 million in noise mitigation funds over 10 years. These funds are essential for the improvement of conditions at these schools. Unfortunately, the Federal Aviation Administration interpreted the 1980 agreement and Federal law in a way that prevents the payment of the funds under the 2005 agreement. Thus, Federal legislation is necessary to allow the use of passenger facility fees for noise reduction projects at the Lennox and Inglewood schools. I am in-troducing legislation to do just this. This bill was drafted with the assist- ance of the Federal Aviation Adminis-tration, and it has the support of the Lennox and Inglewood School Dis-tricts, the Los Angeles World Airports, and the Los Angeles Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa. My colleague in the House of Representatives, Congress-woman J ANE HARMAN , will introduce this same bill today. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this non-controversial legis-lation that will allow for the use of passenger facility fees for noise reduc-tion projects in the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts. I ask unan-imous consent that the text of this leg-islation be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 996 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. EXPANDED PASSENGER FACILITY FEE ELIGIBILITY FOR NOISE COM-PATIBILITY PROJECTS. Section 40117(b) of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ''(7) N OISE MITIGATION FOR CERTAIN SCHOOLS .\u2014 ''(A) I N GENERAL .\u2014In addition to the uses specified in paragraphs (1), (4), and (6), the Secretary may authorize a passenger facility fee imposed under paragraph (1) or (4) at a large hub airport that is the subject of an amended judgment and final order in con-demnation filed on January 7, 1980, by the Superior Court of the State of California for the county of Los Angeles, to be used for a project to carry out noise mitigation for a building, or for the replacement of a relocatable building with a permanent build-ing, in the noise impacted area surrounding the airport at which such building is used primarily for educational purposes, notwith-standing the air easement granted or any terms to the contrary in such judgment and final order, if \u2014 ''(i) the Secretary determines that the building is adversely affected by airport noise; ''(ii) the building is owned or chartered by the school district that was the plaintiff in case number 986,442 or 986,446, which was re-solved by such judgment and final order; ''(iii) the project is for a school identified in 1 of the settlement agreements effective February 16, 2005, between the airport and each of the school districts; ''(iv) in the case of a project to replace a relocatable building with a permanent build-ing, the eligible project costs are limited to the actual structural construction costs nec-essary to mitigate aircraft noise in instruc-tional classrooms to an interior noise level meeting current standards of the Federal Aviation Administration; and ''(v) the project otherwise meets the re- quirements of this section for authorization of a passenger facility fee. ''(B) E LIGIBLE PROJECT COSTS .\u2014In subpara- graph (A)(iv), the term 'eligible project costs ' means the difference between the cost of standard school construction and the cost of construction necessary to mitigate class-room noise to the standards of the Federal Aviation Administration. ''. By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. L ANDRIEU ): S. 1000. A bill to enhance the Federal Telework Program; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Govern-mental Affairs. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator L ANDRIEU in in- troducing the Telework Enhancement Act of 2007. This legislation will build on the existing Federal telework pro-gram to ensure maximum participation in the program among those in the Federal workforce. This measure will improve the cost-efficiency of the Fed-eral Government and will also serve to reduce traffic congestion and thereby save fuel and greenhouse gas emissions. It will also enhance efforts by the Fed-eral Government with respect to con-tinuity of operations, COOP, provide employee incentives to attract and re-tain highly skilled Federal personnel, and provide a model for the private sec-tor. In 2000, the key legislation affecting telework in the Federal Government was signed into law as part of that year's highway bill. The enacted provi- sion provided that ''each executive agency . . . establish a policy under which eligible employees of the agency may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance. '' The measure was intended to apply to 25 percent of the Federal workforce, and to an additional 25 percent of the workforce each year thereafter. The objective of that measure, as outlined in the bill 's conference report, was to ''reduce traffic congestion '' and to allow Federal employees to telework to the maximum extent possible. The Report also made clear that each Fed-eral agency was to establish telework criteria, and remove any ''managerial, logistical, organizational, or other bar-riers to full implementation and suc-cessful functioning of the policy. . . and provide for adequate administrative, human resources, technical, and logistical support for carrying out the policy. '' The lead agencies that have carried out this telework mandate are Office of Personnel Management, OPM, and the General Services Administration, GSA. Together these agencies formed a com-mon Web site www.telework.gov to fa-cilitate the advancement of the pro-gram, which has had a degree of suc-cess. As of 2004, of the 1.7 million Fed-eral employees in the 82 agencies, 752,337 had been deemed eligible for telework, which was an increase from 521,542 in 2001. But despite a very loose definition of ''telework, '' which only requires that an employee work from home 1 day per week to be considered a ''teleworker, '' 140,694, or 19 percent of those eligible, were deemed as having teleworked in 2004. Critics argue that this low percentage of teleworkers comparable to the much larger pool of telework-eligible employees can be at-tributed to insufficient employee edu-cation, program coordination, and workforce culture issues. While OPM and GSA should be com- mended for the strides they have made in implementing the Federal telework program, there are several enhance-ments to the program that can be made legislatively to facilitate the original goal of maximizing telework among el-igible Federal employees. The bill we introduce today would, among other things: invert the telework eligibility presumption to make all Federal employees eligible unless expressly determined otherwise; revise the definition of ''telework '' to be an arrangement where the employee regularly works at an alternate site at least 2 business days per week in order to reduce his/her commute, the current definition only requires 1 day; require that each agency designate a full-time Telework Managing Officer, TMO, within the agency 's chief administra- tive office, or comparable agency of-fice, to oversee the respective agency 's telework program; require that the TMO coordinate the telework policy for the agency or office, serve as the li-aison between employees and man-agers, and keep employees informed of their telework eligibility; require the TMO to work to expand the agency 's telework program, oversee the COOP program, and develop a telework per-formance and accountability system; require the TMO to submit a report to the head of the agency annually with an analysis of measures in place to carry out the telework policy; and re-quire the Government Accountability VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May S3844 March 27, 2007 Office, GAO, to evaluate each agency 's telework policy, and publish a report that rates each policy and the level of employee participation. The events of September 11, 2001, the anthrax attacks that occurred shortly thereafter, and the recent severe weather experienced across the country have focused our attention on the im-portance of energy independence, as well as our need to be prepared in the event of a disaster. This legislation would be a step toward achieving these broader national strategic objectives, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD .

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, stroke is a devastating disease that affects young and old, women and men, re-gardless of their race or ethnic back-ground. The physical, emotional, and financial toll of stroke on individuals and their families is enormous. Fortunately, we have achieved major advances in the prevention and treat-ment of stroke in recent years that have reduced the high toll of death and disability. The Nation 's investment in research through the National Insti-tutes of Health has led to many of VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3845 March 27, 2007 these advances, and it 's tragic that so many stroke patients do not yet have access to these advances. That 's why Senator C OCHRAN and I have introduced the bipartisan Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act in Congress, to help bring what we've learned in the laboratory to the bedside of the patient more quickly. Both Houses of Congress know the im-portance of this issue, and identical legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives. This bill is intended to become a national commit-ment to end the suffering from stroke. It will also be a promise that every American can lead a better and healthier life. By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. K ERRY , Mrs. B OXER , Mr. HARKIN , Mr. , Mr. CHU- MER, Ms. C ANTWELL , B IDEN, Mr. L EVIN, Mr. , Mrs. MURRAY , Mrs. , Mr. , Ms. S TABENOW , and Mr. W HITEHOUSE ): S.J. Res. 10. A joint resolution pro- posing an amendment to the Constitu-tion of the United States relative to equal rights for men and women; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it 's a privilege to join my colleagues in re-introducing the Equal Rights Amend-ment to the Constitution. Our strong commitment to equal rights for men and women should be clearly reflected in the Nation 's founding document. The ERA is essential to guarantee that the freedoms protected by our Constitution apply equally to men and women. From the beginning of our his-tory as a Nation, women have had to wage a constant, long and difficult bat-tle to win the same basic rights grant-ed to men. That battle goes on today, since discrimination still continues in many ways. Despite passage of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s, discrimination against women con-tinues to permeate the workforce and many areas of the economy. Today, women earn about 77 cents for each dollar earned by men, and the gap is even greater for women of color. In 2004, African American women earned only 67 percent of the earnings of white men, and Hispanic women earned only 56 percent. Women with college and professional degrees have achieved advances in a number of professional and managerial occupations in recent years. Yet more than 60 percent of working women are still clustered in a narrow range of tra-ditionally female, traditionally low- paying occupations, and female-headed households continue to dominate the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. A stronger effort is clearly needed to finally live up to our commitment of full equality. The Equal Rights Amend-ment alone cannot remedy all discrimi-nation, but it will clearly strengthen the ongoing efforts of women across the country to obtain equal treatment. We know from the failed ratification experiences of the past that amending the Constitution to include the ERA will not be easy to achieve. But its ex-traordinary significance requires us to continue the battle to finally see it ap-proved by Congress and ratified by the States. The women of America deserve no less. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S.J. R ES. 10 Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Con-stitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legis-latures of three-fourths of the several States: ''A RTICLE \u2014 ''SECTION 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. ''S ECTION 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. ''S ECTION 3. This article shall take effect 2 years after the date of ratification. ''. f SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS SENATE RESOLUTION 125 \u2014DESIG- NATING MAY 18, 2007, AS ''EN- DANGERED SPECIES DAY '', AND ENCOURAGING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES TO BECOME EDUCATED ABOUT, AND AWARE OF, THREATS TO SPECIES, SUC-CESS STORIES IN SPECIES RE-COVERY, AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE SPECIES CON-SERVATION WORLDWIDE Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. C OLLINS , F EINGOLD Mr. Mr. C RAPO Mr. SANDERS ) submitted the following reso- lution; which was referred to the Com-mittee on the Judiciary: S. R ES. 125 Whereas in the United States and around the world, more than 1,000 species are offi-cially designated as at risk of extinction and thousands more also face a heightened risk of extinction; Whereas the actual and potential benefits derived from many species have not yet been fully discovered and would be permanently lost if not for conservation efforts; Whereas recovery efforts for species such as the whooping crane, Kirtland 's warbler, the peregrine falcon, the gray wolf, the gray whale, the grizzly bear, and others have re-sulted in great improvements in the viabil-ity of such species; Whereas saving a species requires a com- bination of sound research, careful coordina-tion, and intensive management of conserva-tion efforts, along with increased public awareness and education; Whereas two-thirds of endangered or threatened species reside on private lands; Whereas voluntary cooperative conserva- tion programs have proven to be critical for habitat restoration and species recovery; and Whereas education and increasing public awareness are the first steps in effectively informing the public about endangered spe-cies and species restoration efforts: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate \u2014 (1) designates May 18, 2007, as ''Endangered Species Day ''; and (2) encourages \u2014 (A) educational entities to spend at least 30 minutes on Endangered Species Day teach-ing and informing students about threats to, and the restoration of, endangered species around the world, including the essential role of private landowners and private stew-ardship to the protection and recovery of species; (B) organizations, businesses, private land- owners, and agencies with a shared interest in conserving endangered species to collabo-rate on educational information for use in schools; and (C) the people of the United States to ob- serve the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to es-tablish the second annual ''Endangered Species Day '' on May 18, 2007. I am sub- mitting this resolution with Senators C ANDERS whose co-sponsorship I appreciate. I want to commend my constituent Mr. David Robinson, who first sug-gested the establishment of an ''Endan- gered Species Day. '' Individuals like Mr. Robinson do make a difference. The designation of an ''Endangered Species Day '' provides a multitude of opportunities for young people, stu-dents, and the general public to learn more about endangered species both in our country and abroad. Last year, thirty-six events were held across the country to highlight endan-gered species success stories. The Gov-ernor of Maine, the Rhode Island State legislature, and the cities and counties of Santa Barbara, San Diego, and San Francisco also declared State and local Endangered Species Days. Zoos and aquariums across the country, such as the Roger Williams Zoo and the San Diego Zoo, also held educational events. Endangered Species Day 2006 pro- vided an opportunity for schools, li-braries, museums, zoos, aquariums, bo-tanical gardens, agencies, businesses, community groups, and conservation organizations to educate the public about the importance of protecting en-dangered species and to highlight ev-eryday actions that individuals and groups can take to help protect our na-tion's wildlife, fish, and plants. Based on the success of last year, I believe that ''Endangered Species Day '' fosters increased communication and awareness about many of the most en-dangered species by encouraging such activities as school field trips to the VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3846 March 27, 2007 zoo or attending a lecture at the local library. In my home State of California, I am especially proud of the conservation and management efforts that have helped significantly restore popu-lations of California condor, winter run chinook salmon, the least Bell 's vireo songbird, and the California gray whale. Despite these success stories, we need to be aware that more can be done. At this time, we have more than 1,800 spe-cies in the U.S. and abroad, which are designated as ''at risk '' for extinction. One small step is to increase awareness about the seriousness of the cir-cumstances facing many of these en-dangered species and educating the public about these species. I am submitting this resolution with the hope that ''Endangered Species Day'' can spark the wonder and inter- est in our youth to continue the con-servation efforts we have begun, but still are far from finishing. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. f SENATE RESOLUTION 126 \u2014DESIG- NATING APRIL 2007 AS ''FINAN- CIAL LITERACY MONTH '' Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. D ODD, Mrs. C LINTON , Mr. C OCHRAN , Mr. D UR- BIN, Mr. K OHL, Mr. K ENNEDY , Mr. MENENDEZ , Mr. S EVIN, , Mr. Mrs. F AUCUS , Mrs. LINCOLN , Mr. A LLARD , and Mr. E NZI) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: S.

R ES. 127 Whereas Cushing 's Syndrome annually af- fects an estimated 10 to 15 people per mil-lion, most of whom are currently between the ages of 20 and 50; Whereas Cushing 's Syndrome is an endo- crine or hormonal disorder caused by pro-longed exposure of the body 's tissue to high levels of the hormone cortisol; Whereas exposure to cortisol can occur by overproduction in the body or by taking glucocrticoid hormones, which are routinely prescribed for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or as an immunosuppressant following transplantation; Whereas the syndrome also result Cushing 's Syndrome can cause ab- normal weight gain, skin changes, and fa-tigue and ultimately lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, osteoporosis, and death; Whereas Cushing 's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of tests, often requiring x- ray examinations of adrenal or pituitary glands to locate tumors; Whereas many people who suffer from Cushing 's Syndrome are misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed for years because many of the symptoms are mirrored in milder diseases, thereby delaying important treatment op- tions; Whereas treatments for Cushing 's Syn- drome include surgery, radiation, chemo-therapy, cortisol-inhibiting reduc-ing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones; Whereas Cushing 's Syndrome was discov- ered by Dr. Harvey Williams Cushing, who was born on April 8th, 1869; Whereas the Dr. Harvey Cushing stamp was part of the United States Postal Service 's ''Great American '' series, initiated in 1980 to recognize individuals for making significant contributions to the heritage and culture of the United States; Whereas President Ronald Reagan spoke on April 8, 1987, in the Rose Garden at a White House ceremony to unveil the com-memorative stamp honoring Dr. Harvey Cushing; Whereas following the ceremony, President Reagan hosted a reception in the State Din-ing Room for Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Dr. Cushing 's daughter, and representatives of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons; and Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise awareness in the general public and the medical community of Cushing 's Syn- drome; Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate \u2014 (1) designates April 8, 2007, as ''National Cushing 's Syndrome Awareness Day ''; (2) recognizes that all Americans should become more informed and aware of Cush-ing's Syndrome; (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy of this resolution to the Cushing 's Understanding, Support & Help Or- ganization. f SENATE RESOLUTION 128 \u2014TO AU- THORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCU-MENT PRODUCTION, AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN UNITED STATES V.

SA 695. Mr. WARNER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 1591, making emer-gency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: On page 94, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following: SEC. 2904. (a) Congress makes the following findings: (1) Congress authorized the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) proc-ess in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107 -107) as the only fair and objective way for the De-partment of Defense to reduce excess mili-tary base infrastructure and to obtain sav-ings from these reductions. (2) In order to ensure a fair and objective process, the President was required to present to Congress a list of bases to be closed or realigned, as determined by the BRAC Commission, in a totality without any changes or alterations. (3) The President submitted to Congress the decisions of the BRAC Commission under the 2005 round of defense base closure and re-alignment on September 15, 2005, two and a half years after the commencement of Oper-ation Iraqi Freedom. (4) As part of the BRAC process, the Sec- retary of Defense was required by law to as-sess the probable threats to national secu-rity and, as part of such assessment, deter-mine the potential, prudent, surge require-ments to meet those threats. (5) The Department of Defense and the BRAC Commission were required by law to determine whether each decision accounted for the ability to accommodate contingency, mobilization, surge, and future total force requirements at both existing and potential receiving locations to support operations and training. (6) Congress took no action to disapprove the decisions of the Commission, thus allow-ing the totality of the 2005 round of defense base closure and realignment to become law on November 20, 2005. (7) Contained within the totality of the 2005 BRAC decisions was the realignment of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., which would result in the closure of the main post and the relocation of\u2014 (A) all tertiary (sub-specialty and complex care) medical services, Legal Medicine, and a Pathology Program Management Office to National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland; (B) all non-tertiary (primary and spe- cialty) patient care functions to a new com-munity hospital at Fort Belvoir, Virginia; (C) the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, DNA Registry, and Accident Investigation to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware; and (D) the Combat Casualty Care Research sub-function and the enlisted histology tech-nician training to Fort Sam Houston, Texas. (8) The decision to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center is estimated to save the De-partment of Defense over $170,000,000 annu-ally after 2011. (9) The cost to maintain and renovate cur- rent facilities at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and in the national capitol region was estimated by the Department of the Army to exceed $13,000,000,000 over the next 13 years. (10) A delay in the closure or realignment of a military installation would cause fur-ther disruption and uncertainty for the workforce supporting the installation and the local community surrounding the instal-lation until the action is complete. (11) The Defense Base Closure and Realign- ment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101 -510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) re- quires the Secretary of Defense to complete all such closures and realignments no later than September 15, 2011, in order minimize to the negative impact on military operations and local communities by establishing clear, specific goals for the realignment and clo-sure activities. (12) The inadequate conditions and proc- esses recently identified at Walter Reed Army Medical Center are, in part, due to an-tiquated facilities spread over a 113-acre campus, which was not initially designed for processes necessitated by current military operations. (13) The BRAC decision will allow the De- partment of Defense to transform legacy medical facilities into a premier, modern, state-of-the-art joint operational medical fa-cility that will combine the best military practitioners, medical practices, and medical research efforts from both the Department of the Army and the Department of the Navy under one roof working side-by-side for wounded servicemembers. (14) The acceleration of the construction at the receiving locations from the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center will allow for a quicker transition of functions and pa-tient services to newer, more modern facili-ties, significantly improving the capability to care for our Nation 's wounded service members. (15) Any action by Congress to delay or re- verse the BRAC decision to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center will result in an unprecedented disruption to the BRAC proc-ess and introduce a level of uncertainty in every other BRAC decision, which could paralyze the efforts of the military and local communities to faithfully carry out the deci-sions made under the 2005 round of defense base closure and realignment. (b) It is the sense of Congress that the re- alignment of functions from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, as prescribed under the 2005 round of defense base closure and re-alignment, should be accelerated to mini-mize the uncertainty faced by the dedicated professionals serving at the Center, and to ensure the quickest possible completion of facilities and the immediate transfer of func-tions from the Center. (c) There are authorized to be appropriated $123,000,000 for an additional amount to be deposited into the Department of Defense Base Closure Account 2005 established under section 2906A(a)(1) of the Defense Base Clo-sure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101 -510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) for the purpose of accelerating construction activities related to the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Any funds so appropriated shall remain available until expended. SA 696.

SA 697 . Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. B YRD, Ms. C OLLINS , Mr. N ELSON of Nebraska, Ms. S Mr. S ALAZAR Mr. S MITH) sub- mitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 1591, making emergency supplemental ap-propriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other pur-poses; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the fol- lowing: SEC. ll. INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF CAPA- BILITIES OF THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES. (a) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress makes the fol- lowing findings: (1) The responsibility for Iraq 's internal se- curity and halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the Government of Iraq, relying on the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). (2) In quarterly reports to Congress, and in testimony before a number of congressional committees, the Department of Defense re-ported progress towards training and equip-ping Iraqi Security Forces; however, the sub-sequent performance of the Iraqi Security Forces has been uneven and occasionally ap- peared inconsistent with those reports. (3) On November 15, 2005, President Bush said, ''The plan [is] that we will train Iraqi troops to be able to take the fight to the enemy. And as I have consistently said, as the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down ''. (4) In testimony to Congress, on November 15, 2006, U.S. Central Command Commander General John Abizaid said, ''I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from taking more responsi-bility for their own future ''. (5) On January 10, 2007, the President an- nounced a new strategy, which consists of three basic elements: diplomatic, economic, and military; the central component of the military element being an augmentation of the present level of the U.S. military forces with more than 20,000 additional U.S. mili-tary troops to Iraq to ''work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded in their formations. Our troops will have a well-defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure neighbor-hoods, to help them protect the local popu-lation, and to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security that Baghdad needs ''. (6) The President said on January 10, 2007, that ''I've made it clear to the Prime Min- ister and Iraq 's other leaders that America 's commitment is not open-ended '' so as to dis- pel the contrary impression that exists. (7) The latest National Intelligence Esti- mate (NIE) on Iraq, entitled ''Prospects for Iraq's Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead, '' released in January 2007, found: ''If strength- ened Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), more loyal to the government and supported by Coali-tion forces, are able to reduce levels of vio-lence and establish more effective security for Iraq 's population, Iraqi leaders could have an opportunity to begin the process of political compromise necessary for longer term stability, political progress, and eco-nomic recovery ''. (8) The NIE also stated that ''[d]espite real improvements, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) \u2014particularly the Iraqi police \u2014will be hard pressed in the next 12-18 months to exe-cute significantly increased security respon-sibilities ''. (9) The current and prospective readiness of the ISF is critical to (A) the long term stability of Iraq, (B) the force protection of U.S. forces conducting combined operations with the ISF; and (C) the scale of U.S. forces deployed to Iraq.

Mr. WARNER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 1591, making emer-gency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: SEC. 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING IRAQ. Whereas on the fourth anniversary of Oper- ation Iraqi Freedom, the regime of a brutal dictator has been replaced by a democrat-ically elected government in the Arab world; Whereas, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723, approved November 28, 2006, ''determin[ed] that the situation in Iraq continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security; '' Whereas, over 137,000 American military personnel are currently serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since March 2003, with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the finest traditions of the United States armed forces, and are deserving of the support of all Americans, which they have strongly; Whereas many American service personnel have lost their lives, and many more have been wounded, in Iraq, and the American people will always honor their sacrifices and honor their families; Whereas the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, including their Reserve and National Guard organizations, together with components of the other branches of the military, are under enormous strain from multiple, extended de-ployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, and these deployments, and those that will fol-low, will have lasting impacts on the future recruiting, retention and readiness of our na-tion's all volunteer force; Whereas Iraq is experiencing a deterio- rating problem of sectarian and intra-sec- tarian violence based upon political distrust and cultural differences between some Sunni and Shia Muslims, concentrated primarily in Baghdad; Whereas Iraqis must reach political settle- ments in order to achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to reach such settle-ments to support a truly unified government greatly contributes to the increasing vio-lence in Iraq; Whereas the responsibility for Iraq 's inter- nal security and halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the Government of Iraq, relying on the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF); Whereas the President said on January 10, 2007, that ''I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq 's other leaders that Amer- ica's commitment is not open-ended '' so as to dispel the contrary impression that exists; Whereas it is essential that the Govern- ment of Iraq set out measurable and achiev-able benchmarks and President Bush said, on January 10, 2007, that ''America will change our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet these benchmarks; '' Whereas according to Secretary of State Rice, Iraq 's Policy Committee on National Security agreed upon a set of political, secu-rity, and economic benchmarks and an asso-ciated timeline in September 2006 that were (a) reaffirmed by Iraq 's Presidency Council on October 6, 2007; (b) referenced by the Iraq Study Group; and (c) posted on the President of Iraq 's website; Whereas the Secretary of State indicated on January 30, 2007 that ''we expect the Prime Minister will follow through on his pledges to the President that he would take difficult decisions. '' Whereas the Secretary of State, the Sec- retary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified about, and, or, provided unclassified material to members of Congress on Iraqi commitments and goals. Whereas Congress acknowledges that the Baghdad Security Plan is in it 's initial months and while there are signs of progress, there are also signs of difficulty and uncer-tainty. Now therefore be it Resolved that VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3888 March 27, 2007 (1) The United States strategy in Iraq, hereafter, should be conditioned on the Iraqi government meeting benchmarks, as told to members of Congress by the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected in the Iraqi Govern-ment 's commitments to the United States, and to the international community, includ-ing: (a) forming a Constitutional Review Com- mittee and completing the Constitutional re-view; (b) enacting and implementing legislation on de-Bathification; (c) enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the equitable distribution of hy-drocarbon resources to the people of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of re-cipients, and ensuring that the energy re-sources of Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an equitable manner; (d) enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to form semi-autonomous re-gions; (e) enacting and implementing legislation establishing an Independent High Electoral Commission; provincial elections law; pro-vincial council authorities; and a date for provincial elections; (f) enacting and implementing legislation addressing amnesty; (g) enacting and implementing legislation establishing a strong militia disbarment pro-gram to ensure that such security forces are accountable only to the central government and loyal to the constitution of Iraq; (h) establishing supporting political media, economic, and services committees in sup-port of the Baghdad Security Plan; (i) providing three trained and ready Iraqi brigades to support Baghdad operations; (j) providing Iraqi commanders with all au- thorities to execute this plan and to make tactical and operational decisions, in con-sultation with U.S. commanders, without po-litical intervention; (k) ensuring that the Iraqi Security Forces are providing even handed enforcement of the law against all who break it; (l) ensuring that, the Baghdad security plan is not providing a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of their sectarian or po-litical affiliation; as Prime Minister Maliki stated to President Bush. (m) establishing all of the planned joint se- curity stations in neighborhoods across Baghdad; (n) increasing the number of Iraqi security forces units capable of operating independ-ently; (o) allocating and spending $10 billion in Iraqi revenues for reconstruction projects, including delivery of essential services, on an equitable basis; (2) The Iraqi government achieving, or demonstrating satisfactory progress towards achieving these benchmarks should be viewed as the condition for continued United States military and economic involvement in Iraq; Sec. 2. Reporting Requirements. A. Report Required on Benchmarks (1) The Commander, Multi-National Forces-Iraq, in coordination with the United States Ambassador to Iraq, shall submit a report (hereafter known as ''the report ''), to the Commander of U.S. Central Command not later than July 15, 2007, and every 60 days thereafter.

SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that \u2014 (1) the primary objective of United States strategy in Iraq should be to achieve a polit-ical solution and national reconciliation in Iraq through increased, concerted regional and international diplomacy; (2) the United States should engage all na- tions in the Middle East, including Iraq 's im- mediate neighbors, in developing a regional, internationally sponsored peace and rec-onciliation process for Iraq; (3) the regional security conferences on Iraq that are being organized by Prime Min-ister of Iraq Nuri al-Maliki represent impor-tant first steps to achieve a more robust dip-lomatic initiative that should be given the full and direct support by the President; and (4) the President and the Government of Iraq should build on the momentum of the Baghdad conference and the upcoming min-isterial meeting by convening a diplomatic conference with the purpose of bringing sta-bility to the region, reinforcing national rec-onciliation efforts, achieving the withdrawal of the United States Armed Forces from Iraq, and promoting a comprehensive re-gional diplomatic solution. SEC. 1802. FINDINGS REGARDING THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The United States Armed Forces, and the members of the Armed Forces and their families, are under enormous strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. (2) The readiness of nondeployed Army and Marine Corps units has declined signifi-cantly due to a lack of equipment and insuf-ficient time to train, thereby jeopardizing their capability to respond quickly and effec-tively to other crises or contingencies in the world. (3) The Navy and Air Force are sustaining high operating tempos in support of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as conducting other global missions. (4) Each of the Armed Forces has impor- tant requirements to modernize and recapi-talize aging legacy platforms and systems if our Nation is to possess the military capa-bility needed to defend against a growing array of dynamic and challenging threats to our national security. (5) The current deployment tempo of the United States Armed Forces will have last-ing impacts on the future recruitment, re-tention, and readiness of the All-Volunteer Force. SEC. 1803.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING BUDGETING FOR OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM. (a) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress makes the fol- lowing findings: (1) The global war on terrorism began in September 2001 and military operations in Iraq began in March 2003, and United States military involvement in Iraq and Afghani-stan no longer represents unforeseen, unpre-dictable, or unanticipated events. (2) Since the beginning of the global war on terrorism and the military operations in Iraq, Congress has provided $503,000,000,000 in budget authority to carry out Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on ter-rorism, including funding for military oper-ations and other defense activities, indige-nous security forces, diplomatic operations, and foreign aid. (3) The President has requested $98,000,000,000 in additional fiscal year 2007 supplemental appropriations to carry out Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism, bringing the total appropriated upon the date of the enactment of this Act for that purpose to $601,000,000,000. (4) The President has requested $145,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2008 supple-mental appropriations to carry out Oper-ation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism. (5) During the past few years, both the President and Congress have consistently underestimated the future costs of carrying out Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism in budget requests and in congressional budget resolutions. (6) The President and Congress have pro- vided funds to carry out Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism largely through the use of supplemental ap-propriations bills that escape the budget lim-itations imposed on regular appropriations. (7) As a result of insufficient budget projec- tions and exemption of supplemental appro-priations from budget rules, Congress and the President have provided the public with erroneous information regarding the true impact of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism on future budget deficits and the growth of the national debt. (b) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .\u2014It is the sense of Congress that \u2014 (1) fiscal year 2008 should be the last fiscal year for which Congress provides funding to carry out Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism through the use of supplemental appropriations that generally are not subject to budget limitations; and (2) beginning in fiscal year 2009, Congress should include funding to carry out Oper-ation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism in the regular budget and appro-priations processes so that the public is able to recognize and understand the costs of car-rying out such activities and Congress may consider whether additional spending and revenue policies should be enacted to offset such costs.

Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 126. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 126) designating April 2007 as ''Financial Literacy Month. '' There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased I have submited a resolution designating April of this year as Finan-cial Literacy Month. I thank my co-sponsors, Senators D ODD, C LINTON , COCHRAN , D URBIN and E NZI. I am glad to work once again with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to advance fi-nancial and economic literacy for all Americans. As we enter into the month of April, I wish to recognize those organizations that released information last April shedding light on financial literacy in our country. This includes Junior Achievement 's annual poll of teenagers on issues of personal finance, the Jumpstart Coalition for Personal Fi-nancial Literacy 's survey of the finan- cial literacy of high school seniors, and the Employee Benefit Research Insti-tute's Retirement Confidence Survey. These surveys present deeply troubling figures that underscore the need for in-creased financial literacy. For in-stance, while 84 percent of teens with credit cards reported paying off their balance in full each month, 16 percent admitted that they were just making the minimum payments according to the Junior Achievement poll. Further, the Jumpstart survey found that most high school seniors failed a test about credit cards, retirement funds, insur-ance, and other personal finance basics, and the Employee Benefit Research In-stitute found that despite modest sav-ings, over two-thirds of Americans are confident in their retirement. In addi-tion to these valuable surveys, I would like to acknowledge the biennial Sur-vey of the States published by the Na-tional Council on Economic Education. It was last released in 2005 and pro-vided a useful update on the status of financial and economic education na-tionwide. The resolution I have submitted today designates April 2007 as Finan-cial Literacy Month, and highlights the need to promote financial literacy. To this extent, I would like to mention a few efforts that give a sense of the variety of approaches being taken to highlight financial and economic edu-cation. Here in Washington, the Na-tional Foundation for Credit Coun-seling will award a winner for its na-tional poster contest later in the month. With a theme of ''Plant the Seed of Saving to Grow Your Future, '' the contest encourages first through twelfth grade students to start think-ing about how to best manage their fi-nances. On public television, a new show, called ''What 's up in Finance?, '' created by station WNET in New York City, will premiere this April. It will help to make financial and economic education more accessible to young adults and introduce them to the range of job opportunities in finance and eco-nomics. In Santa Barbara, California, the Money Camp, in coordination with Junior Achievement and BizWorld, will host a Financial Literacy Training In-tensive program. The event is intended to be the first of an annual event to provide advanced training to profes-sionals in the area of financial edu-cation. In New Jersey, the state de-partments of Education and of Banking and Insurance are coordinating with banks and credit unions to bring staff from government and financial institu-tions who will make presentations on budgeting, saving, and credit at high schools in the State. I applaud these and other efforts taking place in April to address the need for greater finan-cial literacy among Americans. Increased financial and economic lit- eracy can help people navigate around the countless pitfalls found in the mar-ketplace. Consumers with a variety of credit histories can easily find credit in many different forms. Lenders ' aggres- sive marketing campaigns encourage families to take on substantial debt for indulgences and luxuries, which may be harmful if families are already saddled with debt and not saving toward an education or retirement nest egg. Tak-ing on substantial or additional debt that they cannot effectively pay back is irrational, but abusive marketing ef-forts have resulted in unprecedented levels of borrowing. Although the availability of credit has grown dramatically, the under-standing of financial matters has not. Consequently, we are presented with a number of worrisome statistics. During the last 2 years, Americans have on av-erage spent more money than they make. The last year this occurred was in 1933 at the end of the Great Depres-sion. Moreover, the household debt service ratio, which gives a sense of the proportion of disposable income people are using to pay off their debt, in- creased to record levels again in 2006. These findings suggest a serious prob-lem exacerbated by the fact that most workers have not calculated how much they need to save for retirement, even if they believe they are behind sched-ule in their retirement. As policymakers, we need to focus on these issues year round. However, fo-cusing on Financial Literacy Month in April means that we have a designated part of the year when we can reassess our efforts to highlight those that worked and improve on those that have not. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 127. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 127) designating April 8, 2007 as ''National Cushing 's Syndrome Awareness Day. '' There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to have proudly introduced a res-olution designating April 8, 2007, as ''National Cushing 's Syndrome Aware- ness Day. '' I have long been dedicated to quality health care and therefore seek to raise awareness of this debili-tating disorder that affects an esti-mated 10 to 15 people per million. I seek your help in raising awareness of Cushing 's Syndrome, which is an en- docrine or hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body 's tissue to high levels of the hormone cortisol. Though it can lead to death, Cushing 's Syndrome often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed because the initial symp-toms are shared with a number of mild-er ailments. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, abnormal weight gain, skin changes, fatigue, dia-betes, high blood pressure, depression, and osteoporosis. Cushing 's Syndrome can take a vari- ety of forms. Normally, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain which is about the size of a small sugar cube, stimulates the pituitary gland, the adrenal glands, and then the kid-neys, which release cortisol into the bloodstream. High levels of cortisol can result from overproducing cortisol or from taking glucocorticoid hor-mones, which are routinely prescribed for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory dis-eases. Doctors can detect Cushing 's Syn- drome through a series of tests, often using x-rays to examine adrenal or pi-tuitary glands to locate tumors. How-ever, since awareness of the syndrome is low, doctors do not always run these tests, and patients do not know to ask for them. Therefore, treatment often comes later than it should for victims of Cushing 's Syndrome. Potential treatments for Cushing 's Syndrome in- clude surgery, radiation, chemo-therapy, cortisol-inhibiting drugs, or reducing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones. The need for heightened awareness of Cushing 's Syndrome was brought to my attention by constituents who suf-fer from this dangerous disease. For the sake of these individuals and for the benefit of sufferers in your own State and around the Nation, I ask you to join me in this effort to raise aware-ness of Cushing 's Syndrome. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 127) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows: S. R ES. 127 Whereas Cushing 's Syndrome annually af- fects an estimated 10 to 15 people per mil-lion, most of whom are currently between the ages of 20 and 50; Whereas Cushing 's Syndrome is an endo- crine or hormonal disorder caused by pro-longed exposure of the body 's tissue to high levels of the hormone cortisol; Whereas exposure to cortisol can occur by overproduction in the body or by taking glucocrticoid hormones, which are routinely prescribed for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or as an immunosuppressant following transplantation; Whereas the syndrome also result Cushing 's Syndrome can cause ab- normal weight gain, skin changes, and fa-tigue and ultimately lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, osteoporosis, and death; Whereas Cushing 's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of tests, often requiring x- ray examinations of adrenal or pituitary glands to locate tumors; Whereas many people who suffer from Cushing 's Syndrome are misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed for years because many of the symptoms are mirrored in milder diseases, thereby delaying important treatment op-tions; Whereas treatments for Cushing 's Syn- drome include surgery, radiation, chemo-therapy, cortisol-inhibiting reduc-ing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones; Whereas Cushing 's Syndrome was discov- ered by Dr. Harvey Williams Cushing, who was born on April 8th, 1869; Whereas the Dr. Harvey Cushing stamp was part of the United States Postal Service 's ''Great American '' series, initiated in 1980 to recognize individuals for making significant contributions to the heritage and culture of the United States; Whereas President Ronald Reagan spoke on April 8, 1987, in the Rose Garden at a White House ceremony to unveil the com-memorative stamp honoring Dr. Harvey Cushing; Whereas following the ceremony, President Reagan hosted a reception in the State Din-ing Room for Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Dr. Cushing 's daughter, and representatives of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons; and Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise awareness in the general public and the medical community of Cushing 's Syn- drome; Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate \u2014 (1) designates April 8, 2007, as ''National Cushing 's Syndrome Awareness Day ''; (2) recognizes that all Americans should become more informed and aware of Cush-ing's Syndrome; (3) Calls upon the people of the United States to observe the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy of this resolution to the Cushing 's Understanding, Support & Help Or- ganization. f AUTHORIZING LEGAL COUNSEL REPRESENTATION Mr. REID.

TO AWARD A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO MICHAEL ELLIS DEBAKEY, M.D. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs be discharged from further consideration of S. 474 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 474) to award a congressional gold medal to Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill. Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today the Senate will unanimously pass S. 474, a bill I introduced to award a Congressional Gold Medal \u2014the high- est civilian award which may be be-stowed by the United States Congress \u2014 to my dear friend, Dr. Michael DeBakey. I thank my colleagues for joining me in recognizing and honoring Dr. Deakey for his lifetime of medical achievement and public service. I would especially like to thank my friend and colleague from Louisiana, Senator M ARY LANDRIEU . She joined me in circulating a letter to our Senate colleagues on this bill, and she was very helpful in gathering key co-spon-sors needed to pass this legislation today. Dr. DeBakey is currently in Texas re- covering from the very type of heart operation he pioneered. At the age of 98, he is the oldest survivor of the oper-ation he developed to repair a damaged aorta, the main artery from the heart. I certainly wish him well as he con-tinues to recover from this major oper-ation. I would also like to take this op-portunity to thank him once again for his lifetime of commitment and service not only to the medical community but to the world and strongly encourage my colleagues in the House of Rep-resentatives to pass this legislation as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Dear Colleague letter for S. 474 be printed in the R ECORD , and I re- quest that Senator L ANDRIEU be added as an original cosponsor of this bill be-cause without her help, this bill would not have passed. There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: U.S. S ENATE , Washington, DC, March 6, 2007. DEARCOLLEAGUE : Please join us in recog- nizing Dr. Michael DeBakey, a public servant and world-renowned cardiologist, for his many outstanding achievements in the field of medicine. We encourage you to co-sponsor S. 474, a bill to award Dr. DeBakey the Con-gressional Gold Medal. This is the highest award which may be bestowed by the United Stated Congress, and Dr. DeBakey is most deserving. Dr. Michael DeBakey, a native of Lou- isiana and graduate of the Tulane University School of Medicine, is a pioneer in every sense of the word. His long and distinguished career has impacted nearly every aspect of modern medicine. VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3983 March 27, 2007 When he was just 23 years old and still at- tending medical school, Dr. DeBakey devel-oped a roller pump for blood transfusions \u2014 the precursor and major component of the heart-lung machine used in the first open- heart operation. During his service in World War I1, Dr. DeBakey observed soldiers dying on the battlefield who he believed could be saved. From that experience he made numer-ous recommendations to improve the mili-tary's medical procedures, including the de- velopment of mobile army surgical hospitals, better known as MASH units. These efforts earned him the Legion of Merit in 1945. Dr. DeBakey later helped establish the special-ized medical and surgical centers system for treating military personnel returning from the war, which subsequently became the Vet-erans Affairs Medical Center System. In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor Uni- versity College of Medicine, where he started its first surgical residency program and was later elected the first President of Baylor College of Medicine. Adding to his list of ac-complishments, Dr. DeBakey performed the first successful procedure to treat patients with aneurysms, performed the first success-ful coronary bypass surgery, and he was the first to successfully implant a partial artifi-cial heart. Dr. DeBakey continued to amaze the med- ical world when he pioneered the field of telemedicine by performing the first open- heart surgery transmitted over satellite and later when he supervised the first successful multi-organ transplant, where a heart, both kidneys and a lung were transplanted from a single donor into four separate recipients. Most recently, Dr. DeBakey worked with NASA engineers to develop the DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, which may elimi-nate the need for some patients to receive heart transplants. These accomplishments have led to na- tional recognition. Dr. DeBakey has received both the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction from President Lyndon Johnson and the National Medal of Science from President Ronald Reagan. Dr. DeBakey 's efforts and innovative sur- gical techniques have saved the lives of thou-sands, if not millions, of people. We hope you will join us in recognizing Dr. DeBakey 's profound impact on the field of medicine and how we care for our veterans, by co-spon-soring legislation to award him the Congres-sional Gold Medal. If you wish to co-sponsor or have any questions about this legislation, please contact Chad Heflin at (202) 224 -5922. Sincerely, K AYBAILEY HUTCHISON . . Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this matter be printed at the appropriate place in the R ECORD . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill (S. 474) was ordered to be en- grossed for a third reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows: S. 474 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress makes the following findings: (1) Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D., was born on September 7, 1908, in Lake Charles, Lou-isiana, to Shaker and Raheeja DeBakey. (2) Dr. DeBakey, at the age of 23 and still a medical student, reported a major inven-tion, a roller pump for blood transfusions, which later became a major component of the heart-lung machine used in the first suc-cessful open-heart operation. (3) Even though Dr. DeBakey had already achieved a national reputation as an author-ity on vascular disease and had a promising career as a surgeon and teacher, he volun-teered for military service during World War II, joining the Surgeon General 's staff and rising to the rank of Colonel and Chief of the Surgical Consultants Division. (4) As a result of this first-hand knowledge of military service, Dr. DeBakey made nu-merous recommendations for the proper staged management of war wounds, which led to the development of mobile army sur-gical hospitals or ''MASH '' units, and earned Dr. DeBakey the Legion of Merit in 1945. (5) After the war, Dr. DeBakey proposed the systematic medical follow-up of veterans and recommended the creation of specialized medical centers in different areas of the United States to treat wounded military per-sonnel returning from war, and from this recommendation evolved the Veterans Af-fairs Medical Center System and the estab-lishment of the Commission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National Research Council. (6) In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University College of Medicine, where he de-veloped the first surgical residency program in the city of Houston, and today, guided by Dr. DeBakey 's vision, the College is one of the most respected health science centers in the Nation. (7) In 1953, Dr. DeBakey performed the first successful procedures to treat patients who suffered aneurysms leading to severe strokes, and he later developed a series of in-novative surgical techniques for the treat-ment of aneurysms enabling thousands of lives to be saved in the years ahead. (8) In 1964, Dr. DeBakey triggered the most explosive era in modern cardiac surgery, when he performed the first successful coro-nary bypass, once again paving the way for surgeons worldwide to offer hope to thou-sands of patients who might otherwise suc-cumb to heart disease. (9) Two years later, Dr. DeBakey made medical history again, when he was the first to successfully use a partial artificial heart to solve the problems of a patient who could not be weaned from a heart-lung machine following open-heart surgery. (10) In 1968, Dr. DeBakey supervised the first successful multi-organ transplant, in which a heart, both kidneys, and lung were transplanted from a single donor into 4 sepa-rate recipients. (11) In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. DeBakey to the position of Chairman of the President 's Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke, leading to the creation of Regional Medical Programs established ''to encourage and assist in the establishment of regional cooperative ar-rangements among medical schools, research institutions, and hospitals, for research and training ''. (12) In the mid-1960s, Dr. DeBakey pio- neered the field of telemedicine with the first demonstration of open-heart surgery to be transmitted overseas by satellite. (13) In 1969, Dr. DeBakey was elected the first President of Baylor College of Medicine. (14) In 1969, President Lyndon B. Johnson bestowed on Dr. DeBakey the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, and in 1985, President Ronald Reagan conferred on him the National Medal of Science. (15) Working with NASA engineers, he re- fined existing technology to create the DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, one- tenth the size of current versions, which may eliminate the need for heart transplantation in some patients.

Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1002 submitted earlier today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 1002) to amend the Older Ameri- cans Act of 1965 to reinstate certain provi-sions relating to the nutrition services in-centive program. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Older Americans Technical Corrections Act of 2007 that I introduced today with Senator E NZIand Senator R OB- ERTS will restore States ' ability to ob- tain Department of Agriculture com-modities under the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Through this pro-gram seniors obtain their meals through organizations in the commu-nity such as Meals on Wheels. Last year, during the Older Ameri- cans Act Reauthorization negotiations, the Department of Agriculture asked VerDate Aug 31 2005 04:15 May 13, S3984 March 27, 2007 Congress to make a change to this pro- gram. It was not made clear to us at the time that, under this change, States could not continue to receive commodities through the Department of Agriculture. Without this correction, thousands of seniors in Massachusetts and a number of other States will be affected. Depart-ment of Agriculture commodities are much less expensive than what States can purchase on the commercial mar-ket and are of higher quality. And they're less expensive. The State dis- tributing agency in Massachusetts has calculated that purchasing similar commodities would cost $1 million more a year which would lead to 500,000 fewer meals served. Six States in addition to Massachu- setts have been obtaining USDA com-modities for several years. The pro-gram is especially important to our States, to their partners, and to the seniors who obtain their meals through this program. I urge our colleagues in both the Sen- ate and the House to pass this legisla-tion without delay. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to this matter be printed in the R ECORD , with no in- tervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill (S. 1002) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows: S. 1002 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Older Amer- icans Reauthorization Technical Corrections Act''. SEC. 2. NUTRITION SERVICES INCENTIVE PRO- GRAM. Section 311 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3030a), as amended by section 309 of the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006, is further amended \u2014 (1) by striking subsection (b)(3); (2) by striking subsection (d) and inserting the following: ''(d)(1) Each State agency and each title VI grantee shall be entitled to use all or any part of amounts allotted under subsection (b) to obtain, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), from the Secretary of Agriculture commod-ities available through any food program of the Department of Agriculture at the rates at which such commodities are valued for purposes of such program. ''(2) The Secretary of Agriculture shall de- termine and report to the Secretary, by such date as the Secretary may require, the amount (if any) of its allotment under sub-section (b) which each State agency and title VI grantee has elected to receive in the form of commodities. Such amount shall include an amount bearing the same ratio to the costs to the Secretary of Agriculture of pro-viding such commodities under this sub-section as the value of commodities received by such State agency or title VI grantee under this subsection bears to the total value of commodities so received. ''(3) From the allotment under subsection (b) for each State agency and title VI grant-ee, the Secretary shall transfer funds to the Secretary of Agriculture for the costs of commodities received by such State agency or grantee, and expenses related to the pro-curement of the commodities on behalf of such State agency or grantee, under this subsection, and shall then pay the balance (if any) to such State agency or grantee.
