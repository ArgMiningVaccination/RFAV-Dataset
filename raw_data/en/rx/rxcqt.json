It involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to balance its energy flow. In modern society, acupuncture is a popular complementary therapy for weight loss. The idea is that it can help to manage food cravings, increase your metabolism and improve digestion. Studies examining how effective acupuncture is for weight loss have produced mixed results, but there are plenty of testimonials from people who have lost weight after undergoing this therapy. We therefore wanted to explore the subject of using acupuncture for weight loss in more detail, and highlight the specific pressure points when it's used in this way. Can Acupuncture Help With Weight Loss? Acupuncture for weight loss tends to be recommended as a supplement to habits like a healthy diet and exercise routine. Although there's definitely some research that supports acupuncture's role in weight loss, there's a need for more studies to be carried out for us to fully understand the exact contribution it makes. However, the ways that acupuncture is believed to help with weight loss include: Reducing Stress & Anxiety Acupuncture is thought to help you lose weight by stimulating the release of endorphins. These are the natural chemical hormones in your body that improve your mood and reduce stress. Stress and anxiety can sometimes trigger food cravings or responses like overeating, which can lead to you putting on weight. Therefore, it stands to reason that increasing the level of endorphins may help to curb emotional or stress eating habits like \"comfort eating\". Improving Digestion By taking advantage of specific acupuncture points located at the stomach and kidney, it's possible to improve the digestive system's function and even increase nutrient absorption. Caring for your gut health like this can help to ease gastrointestinal issues like constipation and bloating, and also address water retention (this latter can also contribute to weight gain). Regulating Hormones Hormones like insulin (regulates blood sugar levels), cortisol (a stress hormone that affects metabolism) and leptin (controls feelings of hunger) are key regulators of your metabolism and your weight. In turn, acupuncture may help to regulate these hormones and improve their function, which can ultimately aid weight loss. Suppressing Appetite Acupuncture could also help to suppress appetite by affecting the levels of hormones that control hunger. These hormones include ghrelin (produced in the stomach to stimulate appetite) and leptin (produced by fat cells to tell the brain when the body has had enough to eat). Acupuncture can therefore help to reduce cravings and make sure you feel \"full\", resulting in it being easier to stick to a healthy diet and avoid overeating. Boosting Metabolism Acupuncture may help to boost your metabolism by improving the function of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland produces the hormones that control the body's metabolic rate and, when it's not functioning correctly, you can experience slower metabolism and increased weight gain. Acupuncture can actually increase the blood flow to the thyroid gland and reduce inflammation, resulting in a higher metabolism and making it easier to burn off fat and calories. Acupuncture Points for Weight Loss Various acupuncture points are believed to help with weight loss, although the specific points that are favoured may vary (depending on the individual and the practitioner). The common pattern is that all points are believed to be related to the organs and/or systems that regulate your weight, such as the digestive system, nervous system, and endocrine system. The most commonly used acupuncture points for weight loss are: Ear Shen Men Location: In the upper part of the ear. This point is believed to help reduce stress and anxiety, which can contribute to overeating. Spleen 6 Location: On the inner leg, four fingers above the ankle. It's believed that this point helps regulate digestion and reduce food cravings. Stomach 36 Location: On the outer leg, below the knee. This point is believed to improve digestion and boost metabolism. Large Intestine 4 Location: On the hand, in the webbing between the thumb and index finger. This point is believed to help reduce hunger and cravings. When used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise, acupuncture can certainly be a useful inclusion into a weight loss program. In fact, with more evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in weight loss continually emerging, it's only likely to get more popular and attract many new users and practitioners. However, it's vital to note that acupuncture should not be explored for weight loss purposes without first consulting your GP, and you should never try to practise it on yourself. It should only be used as a complementary therapy with the guidance of a healthcare professional.
