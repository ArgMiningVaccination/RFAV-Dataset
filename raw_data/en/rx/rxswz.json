We do this from a functional medicine approach that takes into account each individual's unique health history, exposures, genetics, and biochemical and hormonal levels. We offer the best of both medical and naturopathic practices. You deserve the whole picture: medical and science based recommendations as well as holistic medicine and complimentary therapies. Dr. Loomis created the Center to offer individuals natural and safe solutions to commonly experienced symptoms many have attributed to \"just getting older\" or menopause such as fatigue, weight gain, changes in mood and mental clarity. Too many times she encounters patients who suffer unnecessarily when they are really experiencing hormonal imbalance and nutritional deficiencies. Often patients are told \"all the test results came back normal\" and you \"just need to lose weight.\" If this sounds familiar, osteopath Dr. Loomis offers you a more complete approach to your needs whether it be weight loss or weight gain, control of menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, or preventing and addressing disease. She does this by offering bioidentical hormone replacement and medical nutrition therapy as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. As part of your healthy living program, every client receives advanced hormone testing and a complete micro-nutrient analysis. When it comes to personalizing your treatment there's no guess work involved! Dr. Loomis is unique in that she offers an integrative medicine approach that includes the \"what\" and the \"how\" to healthy living. Take advantage of our different holistic medicine lifestyle programs to ensure your success for weight loss, healthy gut and cardiovascular health and healthy aging. As a client you will have access to pharmaceutical grade supplements, bio-identical hormone therapy sourced from the most reliable manufacturer, and our registered dietician/nutritionist and holistic medicine life coach. We want to meet you and are happy to offer a one time complimentary consultation. [Schedule your consultation online](https://www.loomishealthyliving.com/contact-us/) or call us at [(562) 296-5528](tel:5622965528). We welcome patients from Anaheim, Garden Grove, Long Beach, Los Alamitos, Huntington Beach and surrounding communities. Here is to healthy aging! After a major medical mishap, I struggled to find my way back to health. It has been awesome to partner with Dr. Kim, she made me believe it was possible to be healthy again. My energy level is up, I'm sleeping better at night, and my pain level is down. My autoimmune is no longer detectable. When you live years discouraged, thinking this is as good as it get and suddenly finding someone to partner with, I decided I would get better and healthy.- Ariana Brown First of all, everyone is so nice. Dr. Kim and Lori are so knowledgeable I can't describe why I'm so comfortable here. Lori is so realistic and they have turned my life around so much. I changed my eating habits drastically and it has helped me with my drinking, and now I don't even miss it when I don't have it. I like that all the supplements are here in office. I've been happy since I started coming "}
