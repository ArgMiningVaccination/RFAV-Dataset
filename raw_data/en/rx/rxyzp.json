Eurocam unites European umbrella organisations representing patients and trained health professionals, including medical doctors, veterinarians and other practitioners in the sector of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), covering a broad spectrum of modalities, including acupuncture, Ayurveda, anthroposophy, herbal medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy, osteopathy and traditional Chinese medicine. WHAT is their vision? - In the spirit of WHO's definition of health Of a society which seeks the optimum health of European citizens largely achieved by encouraging and enabling citizens to take responsibility for the maintenance and promotion of their own health whilst also acknowledging freedom of choice in selecting an appropriate treatment from a variety of healthcare options, including CAM. In addition, EUROCAM submits that citizens should have access to reliable information supporting an effective and safe health provision that includes relevant CAM options. CAM should be available, accessible and affordable at both national and European level. - From treatment-oriented agenda to personal health and well-being EUROCAM's vision is of a paradigm shift that moves the focus of healthcare away from primarily a treatment-oriented agenda to one which engages people more directly in their personal health and well-being thereby preventing illness and prolonging life. EUROCAM advocates the notion of salutogenesis, an approach that primarily supports health and well-being, rather than focusing on factors that cause disease. - Holistic approach Of a holistic approach to the maintenance and health care of European citizens that takes into account the psycho-spiritual, corporeal and social needs of each individual. - One health approach Of a 'One-health' approach to health that embraces the understanding that the physical and mental health of the animals we live with and that we rely on for food is given equal importance and consideration to that of humans. In this respect, the provision of healthy environments and healthy diets for animals should be of equal importance in maintaining their good health as well providing the benefits of CAM modalities in their treatment as and when appropriate. - Conventional medicine and CAM That the best of conventional medicine and CAM are thoroughly integrated into healthcare schemes for the benefit of European citizens who are free to make an informed choice about the treatment they require so there is no dichotomy in the delivery of excellent healthcare. WHICH aims and objectives do they have? Aims The main aim of EUROCAM is to achieve a significant political presence within the EU so as to influence the decision making of the European Commission, European Parliament, Council of the EU and the Member States to support and provide the means for the integration of CAM into European healthcare systems as well as to fund research into its benefits and cost-effectiveness. This collaboration recognises the stated wish of the EU institutions and its citizens to deal with the CAM sector as a whole. Objectives - Highlighting the scope and potential of CAM to key politicians and policymakers so that CAM is fully taken into account when the policy is formulated. - Establishing the (added) value of CAM for relevant EU policies and programmes mirroring the Health in All Policies agenda. - Demonstrating the value of patient-focused and cost-effective treatments via CAM services and products. - Demonstrating to health and finance authorities that CAM can deliver significant benefit in terms of health economics.
