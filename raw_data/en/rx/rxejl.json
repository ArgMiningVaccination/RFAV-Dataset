By Ronald Glick, MD TCM is a culturally -based system of healing that includes acupuncture, the use of herbal therapies, as well as a philosophical orientation for balance and wellness. In standard medical practice, a physician goes through the steps of obtaining a patient history, physical exam, diagnosis, and treatment. In the same way, an acupuncturist will obtain a detailed history, perform an exam of the tongue and pulses, and formulate a diagnosis and treatment plan. The diagnosis is within the Chinese system, which looks at the functioning of organs and the flow of energy through systems in the body. Even if a person has a problem that defies western diagnosis or treatment, things may make perfect sense within this system. For example, blood test results may not show a specific cause of a patient's fatigue. The TCM diagnosis may be \"Kidney Yang Deficiency.\" This doesn't mean that the kidneys aren't working in a western sense. But acupuncture, specific herbs, and diet changes may help infuse qi into that system and help restore energy. Naturopathy and Nutritional Approaches: After graduating from college, naturopaths attend one of seven accredited naturopathic medical schools. They are licensed to practice in 17 states and legislature is pending to make Pennsylvania the 18thstate. A naturopath's training makes him or her qualified to counsel individuals on diet and supplements. For example, after a careful evaluation of a patient with irritable bowel syndrome and muscular pain, a naturopath may advise a patient to try an elimination diet and supplement this with a probiotic. Mind -Body approaches encompass a wide range of practices. Increasingly, research is finding a close connection, going both ways, between stress and disease. In conditions such as heart disease and cancer, there appears to be a strong relationship between stress and disease markers. The good news is that there's emerging research that looks at how managing stress with meditation and other mind -body and relaxation techniques may reduce inflammation in the body and help improve the disease outlook. Massage and other forms of bodywork: We may experience stress along with tightening up certain muscles, such as the shoulder girdles. Also, being sedentary may cause muscle tightness or having a condition like arthritis or migraines may \"spill over\" into the muscles. Massage that's performed by a skilled licensed massage therapist can help to ease these problems, along with the added benefit of reducing pain and stress levels. \"Alternative ... complementary ... integrative\" ... what do these terms mean? The term alternative medicine connotes that one uses certain treatments instead of traditional medical approaches. Complementary therapy implies that a person can use the approaches together. People can combine alternative medicine and complementary therapy. For example, someone may take glucosamine for arthritis and also see his or her primary physician for a non -steroidal medication. Andrew Weil, MD, led the way with the idea that a physician can help a patient tie -in or integrate mind -body, nutritional, and other complementary therapies. The Center for Integrative Medicine at UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh are members of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine. The consortium is a group of 57 North American medical schools and health centers that have programs (like ours), with clinical, research, and educational components. This consortium defines integrative medicine as , \"The practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.\" (Developed and Adopted by the Consortium, May 2004; Edited May 2005, May 2009 and November 2009) Why do we need integrative medicine? Some people, who focus on holistic health, prefer to use \"natural alternatives.\" These individuals may take melatonin rather than a prescription sleep medicine. This is fine as long as it's not a condition that requires a specific treatment. Many people seek out integrative medicine approaches when their experiences with \"usual\" therapies haven't been completely helpful. A patient with recurrent migraine headaches that only partially respond to medications may benefit from biofeedback, a mind -body technique. What treatments are included in integrative medicine? Some common treatments include: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and acupuncture, mind -body approaches, naturopathy, and bodywork such as massage therapy.

(cont. from page 1) What makes a program integrative? A comprehensive evaluation can identify specific problems or components that are amenable to treatment. Western approaches may include anti -inflammatory medicines for arthritis or an antidepressant for depression or anxiety. An integrative program would consider whether stress is a factor, or if dietary changes and supplements may help. It may ask if a different system, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, could lead to a productive approach. What does the research show? We're informed by evidence, but often with complementary approaches the definitive study has yet to be conducted. Research is helpful if you're testing a simple intervention, like fish oil for the prevention of heart disease. Researchers recruit a number of individuals and perhaps give some the supplement and others a placebo. They would then compare results of the two groups. People may have complex or multiple problems and the treatments that are used often are complex. Our research methods are shifting to allow us to study approaches in combination, more akin to what one would do in clinical practice. How do we decide what kinds of treatments make sense? For the patient who may be experiencing distressing symptoms that haven't responded to the usual therapies, there are several questions that guide our thinking: Does the treatment have a scientific rationale, such as is mentioned above with stress, disease, and inflammation? What is the level of evidence: is it anecdotal, case reports or case series, or controlled trials? What are the financial costs? What are the trade -offs, in terms of risks and benefits? As the definition highlights, the key parts of an integrative approach are: the partnership between practitioner and patient, using all appropriate therapeutic approaches, and working to achieve optimal health and healing. Previously, we used the terms, \"alternative and complementary.\" Today, we refer to the field as, \"integrative medicine.\" Our hope is that the research will guide us so that there is one form of medical practice, which will include all of these complementary approaches. For more information, please call 412-623-1714 Do you have spinal stenosis in your lower back? You must: Be 60+ years of age. Have been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis confirmed by imaging (CT or MRI). Currently have difficulty walking, but be able to walk at least 50 feet without a cane or walker. Be able to participate in mild exercise. If eligible, you will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to one of three groups: Group 1: Standard medical care Three office visits with a medical doctor over a six - week period at UPMC Shadyside Center for Integra- tive Medicine. Group 2: Community -based exercise Two exercise classes per week for six weeks at the JCC Squirrel Hill or the Vintage East Liberty. Group 3: Clinic -based manual therapy Two sessions per week for six weeks with a physical therapist or chiropractor at the University of Pitts- burgh Department of Physical Therapy in Oakland. If you do , you may be eligible to participate in a University of Pittsburgh research study on lumbar spinal stenosis, or arthri- tis of the spine. Many people with stenosis com- plain of weakness and pain in their legs while walking. Our study wants to compare the ef- fectiveness of three nonsurgical approaches for reducing these symptoms. The Center for Integrative Medicine at UPMC Shadyside is a hospital -based center in Pittsburgh that combines natural healing pra ctices with conventional medicine. \"Integrative medicine\" refers to the incorporation of evidence -based complementary therapies into conventional treatme nts for patients. Integrative medicine is meant to work in conjunction with traditional medicine, providing a more holistic approach to healing \u2014 mind, body, and spirit. 4 UPMC Center for Integrative Medicine Team Neal Ryan, MD, Director Ronald Glick, MD, Medical Director 2014 Lectures and Classes at the UPMC Center for Integrative Medicine Administration Jeanette Adams Administrative Manager Kathy Hecht Administrative Assistant Gail Chalmers -Blair Office Assistant Rhonda Mason Office Assistant Research Christine McFarland Research Coordinator Adam White Research Specialist Practitioners Joseph Bozzelli, MMO Tai Chi, QiGong Teacher Sari Cohen, ND Naturopathic Counselor Deborah Grice Conway, PhD Psychotherapist Psychotherapist Dinnie Goldring, LCSW Psychotherapist Carol Greco, PhD Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Meditation Instructor John Laird, ND Naturopath/Nutritionist Jessie V.
