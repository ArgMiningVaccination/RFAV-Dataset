I want to share with you one of my client's experiences. She was a woman of thirty-five and the mother of young children. She came for an appointment with me saying she had been ill since having a flu vaccination nine months earlier. Immediately after the shot she developed chest pain. When she came to see me, she still had a shooting pain behind her left breast and pain in her right breast extending down her right arm. At the same time, she had developed a strong fear of cancer and of what would happen to her children if she died. She was generally anxious and bit her nails. She also had a history of mouth ulcers, stiff knees, and a blocked nose with post-nasal drip. She was very prone to catching colds and was generally a chilly person. Silica is a remedy with indications that include painful shooting sensation behind the left breast. It can also be an excellent remedy for someone who has never been well since vaccination. It is indicated in anxious, chilly people who are prone to catching colds. I gave one dose of Silica 30C. Initially the pains in her breasts worsened and some old symptoms reappeared briefly: mouth ulcers, a blocked nose and sticky eyes, stiffness in the leg. She then began to feel much better. Two months after taking the homeopathic remedy, she reported that the pains had disappeared, her mind felt more focused, her fear of death had diminished, and she was generally less anxious. She felt stronger and was much less susceptible to the cold. Her health continued to improve, and eighteen months later she continued to be well. My client was fortunate, some people never recover from their vaccine injuries and others lose their lives. Many of these are babies and young children whose parents thought they were doing the right thing. You can read their experiences here: If you are considering a flu shot, whether for yourself or a loved one, please do make sure your choice is a fully informed one by visiting the National Vaccine Information Center site: [http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Influenza.aspx](http://http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Influenza.aspx) Soon I'll be posting great information on how homeopathy can help you recover quickly from the flu.
