The role of decision tree and machine learning models for outcome prediction of bupropion exposure: A nationwide analysis of more than 14,000 patients in the United States. Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology, 133(1), 98-110. doi:10.1111/bcpt.13865 [More info](#more-journal-publication0)Bupropion is widely used for the treatment of major depressive disorder and for smoking cessation assistance. Unfortunately, there are no practical systems to assist clinicians or poison centers in predicting outcomes based on clinical features. Hence, the purpose of this study was to use a decision tree approach to inform early diagnosis of outcomes secondary to bupropion overdose. This study utilized a dataset from the National Poison Data System, a six-year retrospective cohort study on toxic exposures and patient outcomes. A machine learning algorithm (decision tree) was applied to the dataset using the sci-kit-learn library in Python. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used as an explainable method. Comparative analysis was performed using Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting classification, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting (LGM), and Voting Ensembling. ROC curve and Precision-Recall curve were used to analyze the performance of each model. LGM and random forest demonstrated the highest performance to predict outcome of bupropion exposure. Multiple seizures, conduction disturbance, intentional exposure, and confusion were the most influential factors to predict the outcome of bupropion exposure. Coma and seizure, including single, multiple and status, were the most important factors to predict major outcomes. - Dehghani, R., Monzavi, S. M., Mehrpour, O., Shirazi, F.

Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology, 230, 107149. [More info](#more-journal-publication1)Snakebite is a relatively common health condition in Iran with a diverse snake fauna, especially in tropical southern and mountainous western areas of the country with a plethora of snake species. The list of medically important snakes, circumstances and effects of their bite, and necessary medical care require critical appraisal and should be updated regularly. This study aims to review and map the distributions of medically important snake species of Iran, re-evaluate their taxonomy, review their venomics, describe the clinical effects of envenoming, and discuss medical management and treatment, including the use of antivenom. Nearly 350 published articles and 26 textbooks with information on venomous and mildly venomous snake species and snakebites of Iran, were reviewed, many in Persian (Farsi) language, making them relatively inaccessible to an international readership. This has resulted in a revised updated list of Iran's medically important snake species, with taxonomic revisions of some, compilation of their morphological features, remapping of their geographical distributions, and description of species-specific clinical effects of envenoming. Moreover, the antivenom manufactured in Iran is discussed, together with treatment protocols that have been developed for the hospital management of envenomed patients. - Dudley, S., Klotz, S.

Here we describe a case of a patient with transient atrial fibrillation (afib) and painful muscle cramps requiring hospitalization for pain management after being bitten by a Poecilotheria tigrinawesseli (Wessel's Tiger Ornamental) spider. He was discharged with a cardiac event monitor and outpatient cardiology follow-up. The event monitor documented transient afib which decreased in frequency then resolved halfway through the three-week monitoring period. In conclusion, tarantula envenomation is usually mild with local pain and edema most reported. However, bites by some species, such as P. tigrinawesseli may have local and more systemic, long-lasting effects. - Ataei, M., Shirazi, F. M., Nakhaee, S., Abdollahi, M., & Mehrpour, O. (2022). Assessment of cloth masks ability to limit Covid-19 particles spread: a systematic review. Environmental Science and Pollution Research International, 29(2), 1645-1676. doi:10.1007/s11356-021-16847-2 [More info](#more-journal-publication4)After the spread of Covid 19 worldwide, the use of cloth masks increased significantly due to a shortage of medical masks. Meanwhile, there were different opinions about the effectiveness of these masks and, so far, no study has been done to find the best fabric masks. This study reviews and summarizes all studies related to fabric masks' effectiveness and various fabrics against coronavirus. This systematic review is based on PRISMA rules. Two researchers separately examined three databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Laboratory and clinical studies were included. After extracting the articles, their quality was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool. In addition to efficacy, other factors, including the penetration of masks, pressure drop, and quality factor, were examined to select the best fabrics. Of the 42 studies selected, 39 were laboratory studies, and 3 were clinical studies. Among the various fabrics examined, cotton quilt 120 thread per inch (TPI), copy paper (bonded), hybrid of cotton with chiffon/ silk, and flannel filtration were found to have over 90% effectiveness in the particle size range of Covid-19. The results and comparison of different factors (pressure drop, filtration efficacy, penetration, filtration quality, and fit factor have been evaluated) showed that among different fabrics, hybrid masks, 2-layered cotton quilt, 2-layered 100% cotton, cotton flannel, and hairy tea towel + fleece sweater had the best performance. Clinical studies have not explicitly examined cloth masks' effectiveness in Covid-19, so the effectiveness of these types of masks for Covid 19 is questionable, and more studies are needed. - Edwards, C.

Toxicon : official journal of the International Society Toxinology, 207, 48-51. doi:10.1016/j.toxicon.2021.12.020 [More info](#more-journal-publication6)Latifi's viper (Montivipera latifii), also known as Lar Valley or Damavandi viper, is endemic to Iran. It has rarely been recorded, as it occurs in a highly-protected national park. In this first clinical report of a confirmed bite by this species, a teenage girl was bitten on the chin, causing rapidly-progressive swelling of the face and oropharyngeal mucosa. At a local hospital, a misleading history given by the patient's relatives of a wasp sting and inadequate inspection of the bite wound misled the physicians from making the correct diagnosis, resulting in a considerable delay in the administration of antivenom. This allowed the development of partial obstruction of the upper airway causing respiratory distress. After transfer to a tertiary hospital, attempts at endotracheal intubation failed, necessitating tracheostomy, but this was not implemented early enough to prevent her developing respiratory failure and losing consciousness. After she was stabilized, snakebite envenoming was diagnosed by a clinical toxicologist who observed two fang puncture marks on her chin. This was later confirmed when a snake, identified as M. latifii, was discovered at the room where the bite had occurred. Her facial swelling and ecchymosis, attributable to envenoming, were effectively controlled by high-dose antivenom therapy. However, she did not recover consciousness, remaining in a vegetative state. About three weeks after the bite, she died as an indirect result of hypoxic brain damage complicated by septicemia. Prompt diagnosis, relief of upper airway obstruction and timely antivenom therapy might have prevented this tragic fatal outcome. - Mehrpour, O., Hoyte, C., Goss, F., Shirazi, F. M., & Nakhaee, S.

Drug and Chemical Toxicology, 1-7. doi:10.1080/01480545.2022.2083149 [More info](#more-journal-publication7)This study is aimed at establishing the outcome of RSTI exposure to acetaminophen based on a decision tree algorithm for the first time. This study used the National Poison Data System (NPDS) to conduct a six-year retrospective cohort analysis, which included 4522 individuals. The patients had a mean age of 26.75 \u00b1 16.3 years (1-89). 3160 patients (70%) were females. Most patients had intentional exposure to acetaminophen. Almost all the patients had acetaminophen exposure via ingestion. In addition, 400 (8.8%) experienced major outcomes, 1500 (33.2%) experienced moderate outcomes, and 2622 (58%) of the patients experienced mild ones. The decision tree model performed well in the training and test groups. In the test group, the accuracy was 0.813, precision of 0.827, recall being 0.798, specificity 0.898, and an F1 score 0.80. In the training group, accuracy was 0.831, recall was 0.825, precision was 0.837, specificity was 0.90, and F1 score was 0.829. Our results showed that serum liver enzymes being present at elevated levels (Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 1000 U/L followed by ALT, AST between 100 and 1000 U/L) , prothrombin time (PT) prolongation, bilirubin increase, renal failure, confusion, age, hypotension, other coagulopathy (such as partial thromboplastin time (PTT) prolongation), acidosis, and electrolyte abnormality were the effective factors in determining the outcomes in these patients. The decision tree algorithm is a dependable method for establishing the prognosis of patients who have been exposed to RSTI acetaminophen and can be used throughout the patients' hospitalization period. - Mehrpour, O., Saeedi, F., Hoyte, C., Goss, F., & Shirazi, F.

European Journal of Medical Research, 27(1), 21. doi:10.1186/s40001-022-00645-8 [More info](#more-journal-publication11)The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world's population by causing changes in behavior, such as social distancing, masking, restricting people's movement, and evaluating existing medication as potential therapies. Many pre-existing medications such as tocilizumab, ivermectin, colchicine, interferon, and steroids have been evaluated for being repurposed to use for the treatment of COVID-19. None of these agents have been effective except for steroids and, to a lesser degree, tocilizumab. Ivermectin has been one of the suggested repurposed medications which exhibit an in vitro inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2 replication. The most recommended dose of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 is 150-200 \u00b5g/kg twice daily. As ivermectin adoption for COVID-19 increased, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning on its use during the pandemic. However, the drug remains of interest to clinicians and has shown some promise in observational studies. This narrative reviews the toxicological profile and some potential therapeutic effects of ivermectin. Based on the current dose recommendation, ivermectin appears to be safe with minimum side effects. However, serious questions remain about the effectiveness of this drug in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. - Smelski, G., Shirazi, F. M., Massey, D.

Fashionably late: A characterization of info](#more-journal-publication12)Rattlesnake envenomation may lead to a multitude of clinical effects, including a late onset hemorrhage. Laboratory values such as platelets and fibrinogen are commonly used to assess the risk of developing a life-threatening bleed. To date, no specific threshold has been identified that links a lab value to the risk of bleeding. This has led to widespread practice variability among clinicians managing snake bites. In assessing risk for patients, we apply the concept that the more abnormal the lab values are, the higher the risk probably is. Late onset coagulopathies pose a unique clinical challenge because they indicate the potential risk for a life-threatening hemorrhage, yet they have been identified after hospital discharge. There are currently two antivenom (AV) products on the US market to treat rattlesnake envenomations, a Fab product, CroFab\u00ae (BTG, UK) and a F (ab')2 product, Anavip\u00ae (Bioclon, Mexico)..This study intended to characterize the incidence and severity of late coagulopathies reported to a Regional Poison Center (RPC) and hypothesized that late coagulopathies occur at rates higher than previously reported in the literature. Additionally, we sought to compare rates of late coagulopathy between Fab and F (ab')2 AV..The investigators performed an in-depth review of all suspected snakebite envenomations from 2018 to 2020 that presented to an Arizona healthcare facility in the RPC's catchment area between January 2018 through December of 2020. Patients were excluded from analysis if they did not receive any antivenom, had an incomplete medical record with the APDIC, were diagnosed as something other than a rattlesnake bite or had a known medical history that clouded the diagnosis or assessment of a rattlesnake envenomation..In total, 522 records were reviewed of which 283 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 149 patients who received Fab AV and 134 who received F (ab')2. No significant baseline or demographic differences existed between the groups. 95 of the 283 patients developed a late onset coagulopathy. 39% of the late onset coagulopathies were delayed, 32% were recurrent and 29% were persistent. When comparing the two different AV products, delayed or recurrent coagulopathies occurred in 36% of Fab AV- and 10% of F (ab')2 treated patients. Persistent coagulopathies occurred in 17% of Fab AV- and 8% of F (ab')2 treated patients. Interestingly, there were zero cases of late hypofibrinogenemia in any of the 134 F (ab')2 treated patients compared to 26% of all Fab treated ones. The average onset of late coagulopathy post-bite was 8 days for Fab AV and 7 for F (ab')2..The results from this study suggest the total rate of late onset coagulopathies may be underestimated. Additionally, our results suggest the potential that F (ab')2 AV may be associated with fewer late onset coagulopathies, especially late onset hypofibrinogenemia. - Wilson, B.

We describe the expansion of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center (APDIC) to fill such a need for residents of Arizona. The original mission of the APDIC was recognition and management of chemical exposure, poisoning, envenomation, and drug-related medical problems. In response to COVID-19, APDIC expanded its personnel and facilities to accommodate telephone calls and teleconsults regarding COVID-19. Thirteen different topics dealing with COVID-19 were addressed and tracked and included: testing information, isolation, prevention, personal protective equipment, travel, vaccines, therapies, antibody testing, contact tracing, exposure to the virus and what to do in businesses, at work or at school regarding isolation and quarantine. Responding to the public health needs, APDIC accepted >320,000 telephone calls and completed 48,346 teleconsults from March 3, 2020 to March 3, 2021. This represented a 15-fold increase in calls and twice the number of consults over 2019. Upon release of the vaccine, calls increased sharply with >7,000 calls in 1 day (February 7, 2021). In conclusion, the APDIC, rapidly expanded to address urgent public health information needs surrounding COVID-19 while still accomplishing its founding mission. - Klotz, S. A., Yates, S., Smith, S.

The American Journal of Medicine, 134(2), 182-193. doi:org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.09.015 [More info](#more-journal-publication19)Utilization of marijuana as a medicinal agent is becoming increasingly popular, and so far, 25 states have legalized it for medical purposes. However, there is emerging evidence that marijuana use can result in cardiovascular side effects, such as rhythm abnormalities, syncope/dizziness, and myocardial infarction, among others. Further, there are currently no stringent national standards or approval processes, like Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluation, in place to assess medical marijuana products. This review includes the largest up-to-date pooled population of patients with exposure to marijuana and reported cardiovascular effects. Although purported as benign by many seeking to advance the use of marijuana as an adjunctive medical therapy across the country, marijuana is associated with its own set of cardiovascular risks and deserves further definitive study and the same level of scrutiny we apply in research of all other types of medications. When used as a medicinal agent, marijuana should be regarded accordingly, and both clinical providers and patients must be aware of potential adverse effects associated with its use for early recognition and management. - Rinner, G.

The present review aimed to highlight hazardous pollution sources, management, and review symptoms of lead poisonings in various parts of the world. The present study summarized the information available from case reports and case series studies from 2009 to March 2020 on the lead pollution sources and clinical symptoms. All are along with detoxification methods in infants, children, and adults. Our literature compilation includes results from 126 studies on lead poisoning. We found that traditional medication, occupational exposure, and substance abuse are as common as previously reported sources of lead exposure for children and adults. Ayurvedic medications and gunshot wounds have been identified as the most common source of exposure in the United States. However, opium and occupational exposure to the batteries were primarily seen in Iran and India. Furthermore, neurological, gastrointestinal, and hematological disorders were the most frequently occurring symptoms in lead-poisoned patients. As for therapeutic strategies, our findings confirm the safety and efficacy of chelating agents, even for infants. Our results suggest that treatment with chelating agents combined with the prevention of environmental exposure may be an excellent strategy to reduce the rate of lead poisoning. Besides, more clinical studies and long-term follow-ups are necessary to address all questions about lead poisoning management. - Wilson, B. Z., Larsen, J., Smelski, G., Dudley, S., & Shirazi, F. M.

A double-edged sword of using opioids and COVID-19: a toxicological view. Substance abuse treatment, prevention, and policy, 15(1), 91. [More info](#more-journal-publication23)Today, COVID-19 is spreading around the world. Information about its mechanism, prognostic factors, and management is minimal. COVID-19, as a human disease, has several identifying phases. Physicians of patients with COVID-19 may be interested in knowing whether opioid use disorder may affect their patients' course or prognosis. This information may be crucial when considering the opioid epidemic in the US and other parts of the world. Opioid use at high doses and over several months duration can mitigate the immune system's function, which may complicate the course of COVID-19 disease. Potential suppression of parts of the immune response may be important in prevention, clinical support, and therapeutic use of medications in various phases of the COVID-19. Specifically, opioid use disorders via an inhalation route may enhance the \"late hyper-inflammatory phase\" or result in end-organ damage. It is well established that opioids decrease ventilation as their effect on the medullary respiratory centers increases the risk of pneumonia. This increased risk has been associated with immune-suppressive opioids. The ultimate role of opioids in COVID-19 is not clear. This paper endorses the need for clinical studies to decipher the role and impact of chronic opioid use on viral diseases such as COVID-19. - Nakhaee, S., Brent, J., Hoyte, C., Farrokhfall, K., Shirazi, F.

Thus, the present study was performed to collect and summarize the latest information about this issue in a systematic way.: An exhaustive literature search was carried out using relevant keywords. Web of Sciences, PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar were interrogated until 30 June 2019. Case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, clinical trial, case report, and animal studies that focused on the objective of the study were retrieved. This review summarizes the results of 761 papers on glycemic changes due to tramadol exposure. Thirty-six publications reported hypoglycemia and 17 hyperglycemia during tramadol use. Twenty-two studies either reported normal blood glucose concentrations, or did not observe any difference in the blood glucose levels following tramadol use. Finally, hypoglycemia was reported in diabetic individuals exposed to tramadol in 12 studies.: The data suggest that primarily hypoglycemia but some degree of hyperglycemia has been reported with tramadol use. Importantly, all studies on tramadol use in diabetes reported hypoglycemia. Tramadol-induced hypoglycemia may be severe in some cases. The risk of alterations in glucose homeostasis accompanying tramadol exposure indicates time importance of careful blood glucose monitoring during tramadol use.

The center received 399 calls regarding 312 victims of bee stings from January 2017 to June 2019. Calls originated from private residences and emergency centers..Stings occurred at victims' home residences in 272 (84.7%) of cases and 24 (7.5%) in public areas; 251 people suffered 1 sting; 42 individuals, 2-10 stings, 4 had 11-49 stings, and 13 individuals had >50 stings (so-called massive stinging). Three individuals were admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and one 35-year-old man died of anaphylaxis after 1 sting; moderate clinical effects occurred in 32 individuals including 6 admitted to the hospital but not in the intensive care unit. Anaphylaxis occurred in 30 (9.6%) of individuals, 16 receiving 1 sting. Toxic effects, tachycardia, elevated creatinine, or rhabdomyolysis occurred in 13 (4.2%) individuals..In the past, individuals stung more than 50 times were beekeepers working with European honeybees, whereas, in the current era, single as well as massive stings are the result of feral \"killer bees.\" This change in epidemiology requires a new approach to sting victims: those with massive stinging should be evaluated and observed for anaphylaxis and serial laboratory values obtained for days to detect the toxic effects of envenomation. - Smelski, G., Shirazi, F., Junak, M., & Brady, M. (2020). Rattlesnake Envenomation in the Setting of Disrupted Lymphatic Flow: A Case Series. Journal [More info](#more-journal-publication29)Objective: Rattlesnake envenomation is a pathophysiologically complex process with a range of local effects including pain, erythema, local edema resembling compartment syndrome, ecchymosis that extends beyond the bitten extremity, as well as the development of blisters, bullae and tissue necrosis in severe cases. Previous animal studies have suggested that lymphatic flow is a crucial part of dissemination of venom after initial injection to produce systemic effects. However, the effects of baseline lymphatic obstruction on local injury in humans have yet to be described clinically. Methods: Three cases of patients that sustained rattlesnake bites with a history of lymphatic disruptions were reviewed, two with histories of mastectomies and one with chronic lower extremity lymphedema. All three patients experienced bites on the limb affected by lymphatic obstruction, yet their presentation of local symptoms and treatment regimens varied. Results: The first case describes a woman with a history of bilateral mastectomy and complete lymph node dissection who was bitten on her upper extremity and developed severe local cytotoxicity and tissue necrosis despite standard antivenom administration protocols. Providers in the second case treated the patient, who also had a history of mastectomy and complete lymph node dissection, more aggressively with repeat loading doses rather than maintenance dosing based on standard criteria of swelling progression greater than an inch an hour. In this instance, the patient had a favorable outcome with complete recovery of the local tissue and no evidence of necrosis. The final case, which involved a bite on an extremity with chronic lymphedema, resulted in delayed necrotic skin breakdown requiring two surgical debridements after initial standard antivenom dosing. Conclusion: The clinical outcomes of these cases revealed a more severe local injury with lymphatic disruption, suggesting that either venom is unable to travel systemically and concentrates at the site of injection or that antivenom therapy is unable to reach the site of the bite. Future studies are needed to better understand this relationship as this case series suggests that lymphatic obstruction may be a risk factor for more severe local injury. - Yip, L., Bixler, D., Brooks, D.

Morbidity and mortality weekly report, 69(32), 1070-1073. [More info](#more-journal-publication30)Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a liquid, gel, or foam that contains ethanol or isopropanol used to disinfect hands. Hand hygiene is an important component of the U.S. response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol) (2). According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient. Cases of ethanol toxicity following ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products have been reported in persons with alcohol use disorder (3,4). On June 30, 2020, CDC received notification from public health partners in Arizona and New Mexico of cases of methanol poisoning associated with ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The case reports followed an FDA consumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Whereas early clinical effects of methanol and ethanol poisoning are similar (e.g., headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased level of consciousness), persons with methanol poisoning might develop severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis, seizures, and blindness. If left untreated methanol poisoning can be fatal (5). Survivors of methanol poisoning might have permanent visual impairment, including complete vision loss; data suggest that vision loss results from the direct toxic effect of formate, a toxic anion metabolite of methanol, on the optic nerve (6). CDC and state partners established a case definition of alcohol-based hand sanitizer-associated methanol poisoning and reviewed 62 poison center call records from May 1 through June 30, 2020, to characterize reported cases. Medical records were reviewed to abstract details missing from poison center call records. During this period, 15 adult patients met the case definition, including persons who were American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN). All had ingested an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Four patients died and three were discharged with vision impairment. Persons should never ingest alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoid use of specific imported products found to contain methanol, and continue to monitor FDA guidance (7). Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when evaluating adult or pediatric patients with reported swallowing of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product or with symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis) compatible with methanol poisoning. Treatment of methanol poisoning includes supportive care, correction of acidosis, administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor (e.g., fomepizole), and frequently, hemodialysis. - Panich, J., Gooden, A., Shirazi, F.

Toxicon : official journal of on Toxinology, 151, 84-88. doi:10.1016/j.toxicon.2018.07.001 [More info](#more-journal-publication34)This case report describes the effects of an envenomation from one of the most infrequently encountered species of rattlesnake in the United States, Crotalus willardi willardi (C. w. willardi), the Arizona Ridge-nosed Rattlesnake. A previously healthy 57-year-old male sustained a bite to his non-dominant hand from a C. w. willardi. The most pronounced effect from the envenomation was edema and progression of edema that extended from his hand to the mid bicep. He also experienced erythema and tenderness to palpation in the affected limb, and some diminished range of motion in the hand. He expressed only minimal pain. Other than a mildly positive D-Dimer and leukocytosis, he had no significant hematologic effects and no systemic effects. He was treated with standard doses of Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine). He reported complete recovery from the envenomation within three days of the bite. Although envenomation from rattlesnakes is somewhat common in Arizona, knowing the exact species of snake is not. Confirmed documentation is exceedingly rare as most people do not recognize the different rattlesnake species. In addition, some species of rattlesnake (such as C. w. willardi) are especially reclusive and found only in isolated mountainous regions. Being able to confirm an envenomation by C. w. willardi would require not only someone knowledgeable in herpetology, but also, preferably, photographic evidence. This case has both. - Hurst, N.

Kissing Bug (Triatoma spp.) Intrusion into Homes: Troublesome Bites and Domiciliation. 10, 45-9. doi:10.4137/ehi.s32834 [More info](#more-journal-publication46)Kissing bugs (Triatoma spp.) frequently enter homes and bite human and pet occupants. Bites may lead to severe allergic reactions and, in some cases, death. Kissing bugs are also vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas disease. In general, modern houses in the United States are not conducive to domiciliation of kissing bugs (bugs living out their entire life within the home with the presence of eggs, nymphs, adults, and exuviae). Construction features such as concrete foundations, solid walls and ceilings, window screens, tight thresholds for doors and windows, and other measures impede bug entry into homes, and air conditioning reduces the need for open doors and windows. Where Chagas disease is endemic in Mexico and Central and South America, homes often have thatch roofs, adobe walls, and open doors and windows. We investigated numerous instances of kissing bug intrusions into homes in Southern Arizona, California, and Louisiana and documented the reactions to kissing bug bites. Our work confirms the importance of modern home construction in limiting kissing bug intrusions. Older homes, especially those lacking modern screening, caulking, and weather stripping to reduce air leakage, may be subject to kissing bug intrusions and domiciliation. We describe a community in Southern Arizona where domiciliation of homes by Triatoma recurva is common. We also provide recent data regarding kissing bug bites and allergic reactions to the bites. - Ori, M., Boesen, K. J., & Shirazi, F. M. (2016).

We are reporting a fatality resulting from gastrointestinal bleeding after the ingestion of a single dose of dabigatran 150 mg. - Walter, F. G., Stolz, U., Shirazi, F., Walter, C. M., & McNally, J.

Establishing causality of CNS depression in breastfed infants following maternal codeine use. Paediatric 10(6), 399-404. [More info](#more-journal-publication64)We recently reported on a breastfed infant who succumbed to opioid toxicity following exposure to morphine, the active metabolite of codeine, which was prescribed to his mother who was a cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) ultrarapid metabolizer. This report is believed to be the first case of neonatal fatality as a direct result of maternal drug excretion into breast milk and, therefore, it is critical to corroborate the causative relationship between maternal codeine use during breastfeeding and neonatal opioid toxicity with other existing evidence. - Walter, F.
