Sponseller Ation face the AAEP By MS, DACT, Immediate Past President Editor's note: AAEP past presidents have been invited to share their thoughts and experiences in a new column called \"Throwback\" that will run occasionally in EVE. Over the past months, several people have inquired about my year as AAEP president. Questions ranged from: Did you enjoy the year? (Yes!) Are you glad that your time as AAEP president is over? (No!) Do you wish that your time as AAEP president was longer? (No, it was perfect.) What were some of your favorite things about being AAEP president? o Representing the people who care for the horses that we love. o Meeting equine veterinarians from all over the world. o Learning about aspects of equine veterinary medicine that are less familiar to me. o Providing a voice for up-and-coming generations of equine practitioners. Serving as AAEP president was truly a professional pinnacle for me. Admittedly, I started the year wondering if I was the right person for the job; after all, I am a specialist in equine reproduction who works at an academic institu- tion. Clinical research is my hobby. It would be no small wonder if some of our members thought that I had nothing in common with her or him, professionally. But here are some other things about me. I educate young veterinarians, and I have a strong interest in the future of equine veterinarians. I owned a solo private practice before starting my career at the University of Florida. I worked on the backside of the track at Mountaineer Park. I am the mother of two kids, one who is a high school junior looking at colleges and one who is in middle school. I not only work on subfertile females, I was one. I love to ski. I am a woman in a profession that has transitioned from mostly men to one that is growing with women. I am unique, just as each of one of our AAEP members are. I raise this point because the AAEP leaders before me, and those after me, represent myriad factions of life that capture the essence of our membership. Yet, it is difficult to ascertain the complexities of an individual based on readily identifiable characteristics: gender, race, religion, marital status, geographic location and practice type. As we transition with our next generation of equine veteri- narians, it is important that the AAEP leaders represent our members. I have confidence that our present leadership represents our members, but do you? The selection process for future AAEP leaders is as democratic as one can be with over 9,000 members. Names for prospective board members are drawn from the AAEP Volunteer Interest Form (VIF), which highlights the skills and experiences of our members as well as interest in AAEP volunteer activities. Our Member Engagement Committee (MEC) reviews member profiles to focus prospective board nominees and provide balance. Information from the MEC is provided to the Nominating Committee, which considers the demograph- ic needs of the board. Candidate profiles are discussed via conference call and a board ballot is created for an at-large vote by the members. Many members ask how they can be more involved in the AAEP. To some degree, the answer is simple: put yourself out there. Fill out the VIF. Include as much detail as you can about your experience and expertise. Outline your desired participation, and don't be afraid to self-advocate. The person who states, \"I hope to be involved in the AAEP leadership one day\" is not self-promoting. That person stands out as a willing volunteer with a defined goal. Get to know chairs of standing committees and task forces. Members of committees provide input about committee vacancies with a goal of balanced representa- tion. Data (VIF) and visibility (networking) help focus 9,000 volunteer members to you. Now back to the question of whether our present leadership represents you. Ultimately, that is for each member to decide. Here are some interesting facts about the 2019 AAEP officers to ponder. One officer (a) passion- ately studied political science and history in college and intended to teach. That same officer grew up in a veterinary family but did not originally choose veterinary medicine as a career path. A second officer (b) spent a year studying film in Denmark and moved pianos to help offset college tuition. Authoring a children's book is an accom- plishment of a third AAEP officer (c). Yet another officer (d) grew up living on an island and has never won a bike race despite being fiercely competitive. The identities of these officers appear at the conclusion of this column. I am hoping that you will learn even more about AAEP member leaders from upcoming columns in EVE. There is no question that diversity in gender, race, religion, marital status, geographic location and practice type is essential to our future growth. However, diversity runs much deeper than the obvious points. When you get a chance, reach out to a present or past AAEP leader and get to know something unique about him or her. You might be surprised at what you discover. The identities of the officers are (a) Dr. Scott Hay, (b) Dr. Jeff Berk, (c) Dr. Lisa Metcalf, and (d) Dr. David to new AAEP Practice Life, EVE and EVJ podcasts Learn how sharing emergency coverage with area colleagues can benefit your quality of life, professional collegiality and practice stability on the newest episode of the AAEP Practice Life podcast.

Touch Point: Don't overlook young horse owners for practice growth Young horse owners (18-40 years) may present an overlooked oppor- tunity for veterinarians seeking to grow their practices, according to AAEP market research. Not only do these young owners provide the most long-term opportunity for business, but their above- average involvement in the horse industry adds to their prospective customer value. Compared with older horse owners, those aged 18-40 are more involved in the horse industry and their horses see an equine veterinarian more frequently. These owners also put as much or more emphasis on relationship-oriented attributes as they do on their veterinarian's knowledge and experience. Demonstrating compassion, taking time with the horse, explaining diagnoses and having a pleasant demeanor are characteristics that the younger owner places a higher importance on than older owners. With lower incomes than older owners, the 18-40 segment is the most cost-sensitive but also the most likely to increase their already frequent usage of veterinarians. Young owners are the most likely to expect to increase their usage of veterinarian services over the next few years (8% vs. 5% for those aged 41+), pointing to stricter regu- lations at horse shows and plans to do more preventive care and breeding in the future. To obtain more information about the preferences of this important client group, read the complete Touch research report at touch.aaep.org. Log in to the Touch website using the same username and password that you use to access aaep.org. The bottom line: young horse owners can contribute to your practice's bottom line if you take the time to understand the attributes they most value in veterinary relationships and services.

VI AAEP News July 2019 Men and women grow up in different cultures and learn different lessons about teamwork, problem solving and leadership. These differ- ences are often difficult to see, let alone manage.

His volunteer efforts are not only expanding knowledge and appreciation but are helping to heal the human spirit. Dr. Weseli, the May honoree of the AAEP's Good Works for Horses Campaign, has volunteered for the past four years at the weeklong Camp Rising Sun, which provides children with terminal illnesses from across the region an opportunity to forget about their medical situation and experience outdoor adventures and bonding with other children in similar situations. Dr. Weseli rolls into camp accompa- nied by mini horses, goats, and mini pigs from his home. The children get to feed, pet and dote on the animals. \"I love seeing the kids light up and get excited about interacting with the animals, especially considering they don't get that opportunity very often,\" said Dr. Weseli. In addition to Camp Rising Sun, Dr. Weseli has been involved with a Fellowship of Christian Athletes horsemanship camp, leading demon- strations and educational programs for children ages nine to 13 (pictured at right). Campers have learned the basics of horse care and when to call the veterinarian; watched Dr. Weseli perform routine horse dentistry; and participated in interactive horse anatomy lessons. \"I like to volunteer with programs involving children because so many kids don't grow up in a rural environ- ment or on a farm anymore,\" he said. Dr. Weseli is currently offering advice on the restructuring of the Mississippi State University Equine Assisted Therapy Program, which is being reconstituted to combine therapeutic riding programs for children with dis- abilities and for veterans. He expects to help with program fund-raising in an expanded volunteer role. In addition to his involvement with camps and therapeutic riding programs, Dr. Weseli has donated time discussing pets and pet care in local schools; organizing low-cost vaccination clinics with the Mississippi Board of Animal Health; coordinating the applications of a couple of non-profit horse rescues for free core vaccines through the Unwanted Horse Veterinary Relief Campaign; and assisting Mississippi Wildlife Rehabilitation volunteers with care and stabilization of injured deer, hawks, owls and other animals. Throughout 2019, the AAEP's Good Works for Horses Campaign will spotlight AAEP-member practitioners whose volunteer efforts are improving the health and welfare of horses.

AAEP Media Partner Profile: The Horse: Your Guide to Equine Health Care X AAEP News July 2019 MEMBER sHiP FoUnDAtion Three organizations dedicated to the improvement of horse health have announced a call for research proposals to investigate bisphospho - nate administration in racehorses and in young racing prospects intended for sale at public auction. The initiative by the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium (RMTC), the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation and the AAEP Foundation seeks to understand how bisphosphonates affect the long-term health and soundness of equine athletes. No research exists regarding the medication's influence on horses under four years of age. \"The expeditious development, funding and execution of targeted tactical research will be critical to our industry's efforts to effectively regulate the use of bisphosphonates and prevent their abuse,\" said RMTC Chair Alex Waldrop. The areas of requested research are: Improving existing detection methodologies, including the potential use of alternative matrices such as hair and biomarkers in addition to the traditional testing matrices of urine and blood. Understanding the effects of bisphosphonate administration on bone healing and remodeling. Assessing the analgesic properties of bisphosphonates in the horse.Read the complete Request for Proposals at grayson-jockeyclub.org/ resources/RFPBIO.pdf.

The Halina Leonard Legacy Society includes 28 members who have pledged a portion of their estate to the Foundation. Mrs. Leonard, of Chino, Calif., left her entire estate to charities devoted to animal welfare, including an initial $225,000 gift toward the AAEP Foundation upon the advice of longtime AAEP member Dr. Wes Williams, who cared for Mrs. Leonard's horses while practicing in Southern California at that time. Now in its 25th year as the charitable arm of the AAEP, the Foundation has disbursed more than $5.4 million in support of projects and programs that share the Foundation's mission of improving the welfare of horses. Mrs. Leonard was born in Odessa, Russia, and with her father escaped the Russian Revolution in 1917 on one of the last trains to leave the war-torn country. Her father was forced to leave his young daughter in a convent in Istanbul. He then made his way to America, returning for Halina in 1921 and bringing her to the United States. In 1936, Halina married California insurance broker A.J. Leonard, who would become a successful racehorse trainer in Southern California. The couple enjoyed the race meets and assortment of people associated with the sport. Following her husband's death in 1981, Mrs. Leonard purchased several racing prospects. Although none of the racehorses developed into stars, Mrs. Leonard ensured they were well-cared for during their racing careers and in retirement.

Highlights of recent clinically relevant papers Equine ulcerative keratitis with furrow In this retrospective case series, William Berkowski and colleagues in the USA aimed to describe the features and outcomes of horses with ulcerative keratitis with an associated peripheral furrow (circumferential thinning of the corneal stroma 20% deeper than the central lesion and surrounding cornea) . A total of 72 horses with furrow-forming ulcerative keratitis seen at the University of Florida between 1987 and 2015 were included in the study. A de nitive aetiologic diagnosis was available for 37 eyes, with 27% (n =10) diagnosed with fungal keratitis, 38% (n fungal keratitis and 35% (n =13) with bacterial keratitis. Treatment varied between cases. In total, 36% of eyes (n=26) were treated with medical therapy alone and the remaining 64% (n =46) were treated with a combination of medical and surgical therapy. Surgical interventions included keratectomy (super cial keratectomy, anterior lamellar keratectomy or penetrating keratoplasty) with or without an accompanying graft or conjunctival flap. Grafting materials included frozen equine donor cornea, equine amniotic membrane and/or processed porcine small intestine. Of those that received medical therapy alone, 20 (77%) healed with a positive visual outcome and six eyes were nonvisual (23%). Of the 46 eyes which received surgical intervention, 40 (87%) healed with a positive visual outcome and six eyes were nonvisual (13%). In total, 83% (n =60) of eyes healed with a positive visual outcome following surgical and/or medical treatment. The remaining 17% (n =12) were considered treatment failures, with six requiring enucleation and six becoming phthisical. Cases of ulcerative keratitis with furrow may have a more favourable prognosis than previously thought. The speci c aetiologic diagnosis was not a signi cant predictor of visual outcome. Surgical treatment was not associated with an increased likelihood of a positive visual outcome. Faecal microbiota changes following anthelmintic administration In this study, Isabelle Kunz and colleagues in the USA reported on equine faecal microbiota changes associated with anthelmintic administration . The authors evaluated the hypothesis that anthelmintic administration will alter the equine faecal microbiota in horses without an observed helminth infection. Ten horses were treated with a single dose of an anthelmintic containing moxidectin and praziquantel. Faecal samples were collected before and after treatment. Amplicon sequencing data were quality- ltered, processed and analysed using QIIME2. Anthelmintic treatment corresponded with a small but signi cant decrease in alpha diversity. Analysis of taxonomic abundances before and after treatment with DESeq2 identi ed 21 features that were signi cantly different after treatment. Differences in beta diversity associated with treatment were not signi cant and potentially suggest factors unique to the individual may play an essential role in the speci c responses observed.The results of this study do not indicate a broad, large-scale impact on the gastrointestinal microbiota after anthelmintic treatment. The results do, however, suggest the potential of individualised responses that are based instead on host factors. Identi cation of these factors and investigation of their impact on the host/microbiota relationship will contribute signi cantly to our understanding of the role of the microbiome in horse health. SAA concentration in post-operative colic horses In this prospective case study, Maia Aitken and colleagues in the USA aimed to determine serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations in the post-operative (PO) colic horse and its association with PO complications and infection . Blood samples from 51 horses undergoing exploratory celiotomy were analysed for quantitative SAA and brinogen concentrations and for neutrophil count at days 0, 1, 2 and 4- 6 and at hospital discharge. Complications developed in 35 (69%) horses and included PO colic (n =13, 25%), PO re flux (n (n =7, 14%) and diarrhoea (n =4, 8%). There was an association between day 2 SAA and PO colic, diarrhoea, IVC complications and PO re flux as well as day 4 -6 SAA and PO colic and diarrhoea. Discharge SAA concentration was associated with SSI. Fibrinogen concentrations at days 4 -6 and at discharge were associated with PO colic, diarrhoea, IVC complications and PO re flux. No differences were seen in SAA, brinogen or neutrophils between horses with PO infection and those with noninfection-associated complications. Serum amyloid A was markedly increased in the PO period in all horses but did not differ between PO infection and noninfection complications. The amount of in flammation associated with PO colic and colic surgery was high and may have affected the predictive value of SAA for early PO infection. Although increases occurred earlier, measurement of SAA with a point-of-care analyser may not be a more sensitive indicator of infection in the early PO colic horse than brinogen concentration. Serum amyloid A may help detect SSI in the late PO period. Equine gastric glandular disease treatments This prospective study by Georgie Varley and colleagues in the UK compared the ef cacy of misoprostol and combined omeprazole -sucralfate for the treatment of equine gastric glandular disease . Horses were enrolled onto the study if they presented with clinical signs consistent with equine gastric disease and were subsequently found to have grade >1/4 glandular disease identi ed by gastroscopy. Horses were assigned to one of the two treatment groups (5 lg/kg misoprostol orally twice daily or 4 mg/kg enteric-coated omeprazole plus 12 mg/kg sucralfate orally twice daily) based on the hospital at which they were initially examined. Gastroscopy was repeated 28 - 35 days after the initial examination, and images were \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd338 10.1111/eve.13123reviewed by clinicians blinded to the treatment received. Owners/keepers were not blinded to the treatments and were asked to complete a questionnaire prior to both gastroscopy examinations. Lesion healing was de ned as improvement to a grade 0, and horses were considered to have improved if the score decreased by at least one grade. A total of 63 horses met the inclusion criteria, with poor performance being the most common presenting sign. All horses had lesions involving the pylorus and/or pyloric antrum, and there was an overall reduction in lesion score in both treatment groups. Of those treated with misoprostol, 72% of lesions healed, compared with 20% of the omeprazole - sucralfate group. In addition, 98% of horses in the misoprostol group improved, compared with 65% in the omeprazole - sucralfate group. Overall healing and improvement of lesions were associated with resolution of clinical signs. Misoprostol was superior to combined omeprazole - sucralfate treatment both for improvement and for healing of gastric glandular lesions. Deep digital flexor tendinopathy In this retrospective case series, Andrew Jones and colleagues in the USA described the use of non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) to identify deep digital flexor (DDF) tendinopathy in 28 horses with lameness attributed to pain in regions distal to the metatarsophalangeal or metacarpophalangeal joints . Medical records were searched to identify horses that had undergone non-contrast-enhanced CT with or without high- eld MRI as part of an evaluation for lameness localised to areas distal to the metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joint in 1 limb. Horses were included in the study if they had 1 DDF tendon lesion (DDF imaging anaesthetic agents and duration of anaesthesia and imaging ndings. Bilateral imaging was performed for all horses, irrespective of unilateral or bilateral lameness. Nine of 28 horses underwent both CT and MRI, and all DDF tendon lesions identi ed by one modality were identi ed by the other. Of 48 limbs with DDF tendinopathy, 46 (96%) had core lesions and 35 (73%) had dorsal border irregularities. Median anaesthesia time for CT and CT followed by MRI was 15 and 110 minutes, respectively. Results suggested that non-contrast-enhanced CT was useful for identifying DDF tendinopathy in horses with lameness localised to the phalangeal regions, and this was supported by consistency of ndings in a subset of horses that underwent MRI. Further research is needed to con rm these results. Tarsal slab fractures in juvenile Thoroughbreds This study by Cate Steel and colleagues in Australia and the USA examined the prevalence, radiographic resolution and outcomes of slab fractures of the third (T3) and central tarsal (Tc) bones in juvenile Thoroughbred horses .Weanling and yearling horses with complete or incomplete T3 or Tc fracture were identi ed by searching a database of radiographs. The prevalence and radiographic appearance of fractures of T3 and Tc at initial diagnosis and after continued pasture turnout, as well as prognosis for racing, were determined. Fractures were identi ed in 186 tarsi (184 T3 fracture only, 1 Tc fracture only and 1 Tc and T3 fracture) of 157 horses (126 unilateral T3, 29 bilateral T3, 1 contralateral Tc and T3 and 1 unilateral Tc and T3) from 7676 examinations. The prevalence of T3 and Tc fractures was 2.40 and 0.04 per 100 radiographic examinations, respectively. Fractures were identi ed on the D556-65 \u00b0MPlLO view and occurred by survey examination at 11.1/C61.3 months in 85.7% horses. At initial diagnosis, 84.3% of T3 fractures appeared incomplete and involved the distal articular surface. Fracture score improved, and dorsal modelling and osteoarthritis score increased in the distal intertarsal joint, but not the tarsometatarsal joint, between survey and repository examinations. Fractures healed by repository examination in 71.9% of tarsi if there was >6 months between examinations. There was no difference in sale price, and horses with T3 fractures had fewer trials when 2 and 3 years old, yet there was no difference in other parameters of racing success at 2 or 3 years old compared with controls. These results show that most tarsal slab fractures in juvenile Thoroughbreds heal with continued pasture turnout of>6 months. Further investigation is required to determine risk factors and before making rm conclusions regarding the optimal management, prognosis for racing and long-term soundness. S.

Equine inpain management fortheequine practitioner Four articles published inthisissue ofEVE demonstrate recent advances inequine pain management; they also highlight some issues around these developments (Bruniges etal.2019; Hopster and van Eps 2019; McFadzean and Love 2019; van Loon 2019). This editorial aims tosummarise these advances and enlarge onthe practical implications forthe equine clinician. Inturn, this should contribute toimproving our patients 'health, welfare and outcome. These equine advances fall into increasing evidence 2019; Loon 2019) and the development ofpain scoring systems (Hopster and van Eps 2019; ofadministration toaffect as many different parts ofthepain pathway aspossible (Figs 1 and 2).Many clinicians already either deliberately or inadvertently employ aspects ofmultimodal analgesia when using traditional analgesics, and there areboth class ofdrugs given tohorses. They have thebene tsofarelatively wide and Love 2019) butalthough there are potential deleterious side effects (Andrews and McConnico 2009; McFadzean and Love 2019) thisdoes not appear topreclude their widespread useinhorses. Alpha2-agonists are primarily used assedatives but have antinociceptive effects (Muir and Robertson 1985; Moens etal. 2003), enabling them to contribute to have animportant role pain. a2-agonists reduce propulsive gastrointestinalmotility; however, there are noreports demonstrating that their repeated orlonger term usecauses colic. Opioids tocon flicting evidence oftheir efcacy and potential side effects. Studies reporting unwanted side effects are generally from pain-free horses undergoing research; the more 'clinical etal.2006). regularly use opioids foranalgesia and anaesthesia. Local anaesthetics are the only agents that completely block sensory input and loco-regional anaesthesia adds signi cantly tomultimodal tocase reports (Hopster and van Eps 2019; McFadzean and Love 2019), most clinicians appreciate the added value ofloco- regional anaesthesia when itisincluded in pain management protocols. Evidence fortheanalgesic efcacy ofsystemic local anaesthetics isweaker and side effects can occur (McFadzean and Love 2019). Ketamine is most familiar as an anaesthetic agent, but it has potent analgesic effects due to NMDA antagonism and can be administered atsub-anaesthetic 'New 'agents The case report by Bruniges etal. (2019), and the accompanying clinical commentary (van Loon 2019) illustrate Spinal cord: Modulation of the nerve impulseBrain: Modulation/Perception Sensory nerve fibre: Transmission of the nerve impulse Nociceptor: Transduction = conversion of stimulus into nerve impulse Fig1:Schematic summary ofthepain pathway. Alter Perception 10.1111/eve.13009both 'new ways to use old drugs ', and also introduce some 'newer 'drugs. Paracetamol is very widely used for analgesia in people although its precise mechanism of action is still not fully understood. Most evidence suggests it acts on serotonergic and cannabinoid pain pathways in the CNS and has only very mild interactions with cyclooxygenase (COX); hence it can be regarded as a centrally acting analgesic. Since it is not a NSAID (does not inhibit COX), it can be used alongside NSAIDs. Paracetamol has become popular for acute pain in dogs and in horses good effect has been reported for particularly intractable pain in acute laminitis (West et al. 2011). Whilst there is as yet little evidence for its analgesic efcacy in horses, paracetamol 's oral bioavailability is excellent (Neirinckx et al. 2010; van Loon 2019). Although unlikely to be ef cacious for use as a sole analgesic, anecdotal experience suggests it has a role in multimodal analgesia. Gabapentin has been used to treat neuropathic pain in people for over 20 years and its use in horses for neuropathic pain (Davis et al. 2007) and chronic laminitis has been reported (Guedes et al. 2013; Caldwell et al. 2015). However, oral gabapentin has poor bioavailability in horses and probably always fails to reach plasma levels associated with analgesia in people (Guedes et al. 2013). Tramadol is a synthetic opioid that also acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Some analgesic effect has been reported in chronic laminitis, but this was improved signi cantly when co-administered for 3 days with a daily 6 h ketamine CRI (Guedes et al. 2012, 2016). Like gabapentin, tramadol has a poor oral bioavailability. It also has potential for misuse and is classi ed as a Schedule 3 controlled drug. Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHI) are new agents with effect in in flammatory processes, with one case report describing their use in laminitis (Guedes et al. 2013). The review by Hopster and van Eps (2019) illustrates how pain is both individual to the animal and also to the disease process, including its chronicity. Some agents may be more suitable for treating one type of pain than another (e.g. ketamine, gabapentin, tramadol in neuropathic pain); sEHI appear more et al. 2013, 2017). Bisphosphonates and amitriptyline (Hopster and van Eps 2019) have potential as analgesics in horses but their use has not yet been reported. Pain-scoring systems in horses McFadzean and Love (2019) reiterate that treatment of pain is dependent on its recognition. The ability to measure pain objectively also helps to evaluate the ef cacy of analgesic therapies. Several composite equine pain scales [e.g. Bussi /C18eres et al. (2008), Sutton et al. (2013a,b), van Dierendonk and van Loon (2016), Taffarel et al. (2015), Gleerup and Lindegaard (2016)] and facial expression equine pain scales (Dalla Costa et al. 2014; Gleerup et al. 2015; van Loon and van Dierendonck 2017) have been described. These scales vary in their attributes such as validation, type of pain they have been designed for and ease of use. However, they should still provide the basis for clinicians at least to attempt to measure and monitor the degree of pain in their patients, particularly those residents within the clinic.Conclusion Evidence for the most effective treatments in horses is considerably sparser than in human medicine. However, reports of prospective studies, treatments extrapolated from other species and individual cases have contributed to our evidence base and should encourage clinicians and scientists to work together to enlarge it further.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium diphosphonic acid - um salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sen- sitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyper - kalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in hors- es less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormal - ities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the field study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary Products 7015 66211 866-933-2472 \u00a9 2018 Dechra Ltd.

Surgical excision of the mass was performed under standing sedation using a transcutaneous approach and the excised sialolith submitted for histopathological and mineral composition analyses. Histological examination found no evidence of a nidus at the sialolith 's core. Mineral analysis of the sialolith revealed its composition to be 40% calcium phosphate (apatite) and 60% calcium carbonate. The mare recovered with no post-operative complications and was clinically unremarkable 2 years later. Introduction Sialolithiasis is a rare condition in horses and has been infrequently reported in the veterinary literature (MacLean 2006; Barat and Rawlinson 2013; Kilcoyne et al. 2015) although there may be a higher incidence in donkeys (Misk and Nigam 1984; Kay 2006; Oreff et al. 2016). commonly et al. 1991; Rakestraw 2003; Kay 2006). Multiple sialoliths have been reported but are uncommon (Singh et al. 1987). To the author 's knowledge, there are no detailed reports of standing transcutaneous excision of sialoliths. This paper reports a con rmed case of chronic sialolithiasis in the parotid salivary gland duct in a horse, treated by surgical excision using a transcutaneous approach under standing sedation. Case details An 11-year-old Thoroughbred mare, kept as part of a university teaching herd, was presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Teaching Hospital (OVAH) for routine dental evaluation and examination of a protruding facial mass in the right maxillary region of approximately 12 months ' duration. The teaching herd manager reported that the mass had gradually increased in size during this period and the mare had shown no evidence of dysphagia or dif culty drinking. The mare had not been used for ridden work so noinformation was available regarding acceptance of a bit or bridle during this time. Clinical examination at presentation revealed the mare to have normal clinical parameters and mentation with no evidence of regional lymphadenopathy. An oral examination was unremarkable. Palpation of the right maxillofacial region revealed a rm elongated smooth subcutaneous mass of 8 cm length 92 cm width. The mass was present under the skin in the right maxillary region in the proximity of and lateral to premolar 4 (tooth 108) (Floyd 1991). The mass was not adherent to the skin and no pain could be elicited on palpation ( Fig 1 ). No other abnormalities were evident on a general physical or oral examination. Radiographic examination ( Fig 2 ) of the right maxillary region revealed a discrete mineralised radio-opaque oval structure with smooth borders lateral to premolar 3 (tooth 107) and premolar 4 (tooth 108). A small radiolucent area was evident at the centre of the mass and oval concentric lines were present around it. An ultrasonographic evaluation of the right parotid salivary gland duct revealed a hyperechoic structure that cast a strong acoustic shadow and was located within the margins of the salivary duct. A provisional diagnosis of a single large sialolith in the rostral aspect of the right parotid salivary duct was made and the decision taken to perform a surgical excision via a transcutaneous approach using standing sedation. Peripheral venous blood samples were obtained for routine preoperative haematological and serum biochemical analyses with all parameters being within normal limits. An intravenous catheter was aseptically placed in the left jugular vein. Preoperative medication administered as a bolus before and during the procedure, as required to maintain a plane of sedation that allowed the procedure to be performed. Lignocaine hydrochloride (0.25 mg/kg bwt: 2% Lignocaine6) was instilled into the subcutaneous tissues overlying the mass to provide surgical anaesthesia. The right maxillary region was aseptically prepared and draped. A skin incision was made over the long axis of the mass and the subcutaneous tissues were sharply divided to expose the wall of the parotid salivary duct. The lateral wall of the duct was sharply incised and the ovoid mass ( Fig 3 ) retrieved from culture and sensitivity was obtained from lumen and wall at the sialolith site. was passed through advanced until itappeared through thebuccal ostium into the oral cavity. The suture material was then tied onto the distal aspect ofsilastic tubing (10 gauge French urethral catheter8).Byapplying traction tothenylon suture salivary gland duct via the thesurgical site, thenylon suture removed and the tothe incision site (Fig4).Catheterisation oftheparotid was sitetoreduce the riskof dehiscence. Therostral aspect ofthecatheter was withdrawn 3cm 3-0glycomer 631 (Biosyn8)inasimple interrupted suture pattern and thesubcutaneous tissues were closed with 2-0glycomer 631(Biosyn8)inasimple continuoussuture pattern. Prior toskin closure, saliva was visually con rmed toflowthrough thefeeding tube. The skin incision was closed with 2-0nylon (Ethicon7)i na simple interrupted suture pattern. The excised mass was submitted forhistopathological and mineral analyses. Post-operative medication included sixfurther days the post- and thesilastic tubing (10French Catheter8) was removed 7days post-operatively when the mare was discharged. The mare was re-examined asanout-patient 14days after surgery when the skin sutures were removed and was found tobeclinically unremarkable and having nodifculty eating ordrinking. There was noevidence ofinfection, stula formation orswelling atthesurgical site. Two years later, the mare remained clinically unremarkable with noabnormality apparent ofthe bordered and around central area ofradiolucency islocated intheregion demarcated bythemolars 107 and 108. EVJLtd344 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019although after surgical removal and prior tosample submission tothe pathology laboratory, there appeared to beacentral spherical core within which anidus likely had been present (Fig3).Samples ofthe sialolith were assessed for mineral composition which revealed ittobeacombination of40% calcium phosphate and 60% calcium carbonate. Thisresult is with previous sialoliths (Kay 2006; Bacterial culture oftheswab obtained from theparotid duct populations had susceptibility togentamicin sulphate and penicillin onantibiogram/sensitivity testing. Discussion The horse has three paired salivary glands, the parotid, mandibular and sublingual, with entry offoreign material such asplant awns, ascending infection and trauma from sharp enamel points onthemolars, more likely (Kilcoyne etal. 2015). salivary aredeposited (Bouayad Kay 2006). This organic matter identi edasforeign bodies such asgrain, plant awns Thismay have been due tothe nidus being composed ofcellular debris which has a ofanamnesis, clinical examination, radiographic examination, ultrasonographic evaluation and Carlson etal.2015), which isanding consistent with Radiographic examination aids in the diagnosis of sialolithiasis inequids. This mare 's radiographic ndings matched the typical radiographic description ofadiscrete mineral opacity within thesofttissue structures inthe oftheadjacent cheek (Isgren and Fig3:The incision. VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE JULY 20192019Townsend 2016). Ultrasonographic evaluation of the parotid salivary glands and ducts can con rm the diagnosis with the characteristic ndings of a hyperechoic structure with acoustic shadows and can also identify septic sialodenitis (Kilcoyne et al. 2015; Carlson et al. 2015). The sialolith evaluation ndings in this case were consistent with the clinical history and the results of the radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. There was no indication to suggest a neoplastic process at the site of the sialolith within the parotid salivary gland. Bacterial culture and sensitivity evaluation has been performed rarely during surgical treatment of sialolithiasis, although the growth of Streptococcus viridans has been previously reported (Kilcoyne et al. 2015). We consider correct prophylactic antibiotic therapy to be essential in avoiding complications associated with the transcutaneous approach to sialolith removal. Successful treatment of sialolithiasis in horses has been reported with surgical excision of the sialolith using transoral and percutaneous approaches (MacLean 2006; Carlson et al. 2015). Complications of a transoral approach include difculty in accessing the sialolith, infection at the unsutured surgical site, stula formation at the surgical site and granulation tissue causing an obstruction at the buccal ostium (Kilcoyne et al. 2015). Complications of a transcutaneous approach include stula formation if closure of the parotid salivary duct fails, and damage to the dorsal branch of the facial nerve (MacLean 2006; Carlson et al. 2015). A transoral approach instead of a transcutaneous approach has been recommended by numerous authors (Baskett et al. 1995; Kay 2006; MacLean 2006; Kilcoyne et al. 2015; Oreff et al. 2016). We consider a transcutaneous approach using a standing sedation protocol to have several advantages over a transoral approach in the treatment of sialolithiasis in the horse. These include superior exposure of the parotid salivary duct surgical site, correct silastic tubing placement within the parotid salivary duct, precise suture placement with accurate repair of the lateral wall of the parotid salivary gland, decreased risk of infection compared to an oral incision and increased comfort for the horse during mastication in the immediate post-operative period. In this case a transcutaneous approach allowed a large sialolith to be removed from the rostral parotid duct which would not have been possible using a transoral approach. Additionally, performing the procedure under standing sedation eliminates the requirement for a general anaesthetic. The use of silastic tubing to ensure patency of the buccal ostium ensured adequate drainage of saliva from the ostium and reduced pressure from saliva at the surgical site (Fig 4 ). The silastic tubing was also useful during reconstruction of the duct lumen during closure. Surgical excision of a large sialolith via a transcutaneous approach was used to successfully treat chronic sialolithiasis in this case and resulted in a return to normal function and structure of the right parotid salivary gland. Clinical relevance To our knowledge, there are no previous detailed reports of a transcutaneous approach for sialolith removal in horses under a standing sedation protocol. Several authors have reported a transcutaneous approach to the parotid salivary gland et al. 1995; Kilcoyne et al.2015; Carlson et al. 2015). Two reports discuss a transcutaneous approach in the standing horse without detail (Ramey 1987; Kay 2006). Surgical excision of the large sialolith in this case report enabled a full resolution of the clinical signs in the follow-up period and is recommended in the treatment of sialolithiasis in horses when a transoral approach is not possible.

J. T. Y. Graham*, P. M. Dixon, N. Haizelden, L. R. Morrison\u00a7and R. J. M. Reardon Equine Hospital, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, Midlothian;Ledston Equine Clinic, Castleford; and\u00a7Easter Bush Pathology, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, Midlothian, describes a 10-year-old Welsh Section D gelding presented for signs of neck stiffness that was found to have a mineralised lesion in the funicular part of the nuchal ligament overlying the dorsal aspect of the rst cervical vertebra using radiography and ultrasonography. Surgical resection of the mass, including a complete removal of the adjacent nuchal ligament, resulted in improvement in the signs of neck stiffness. Histopathological examination identi ed the mass as calcinosis circumscripta. These lesions do not appear to have been reported at this site nor has outcome following excision of a complete section of the nuchal ligament. Case history A 10-year-old Welsh Section D gelding used for low-grade dressage presented with a history of reluctance in bending its neck to the left and general stiffness, with an inability to exercise in a small circle. Progressively worsening signs of head-shaking were reported and physiotherapy had not improved the condition. The owner had been in possession of the gelding since he was 10 months old and there was no known history of injury; however, a chronic intermittent multi- limb lameness was reported and had been managed with rest and oral nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory medication. Radiography of the head and neck prior to referral identi ed a radio-opaque mass dorsal to the rst cervical vertebra (C1). Clinical examination On admission, the gelding was bright and alert, in good body condition and weighed 524 kg. All clinical parameters were within normal limits. A rm, elongated, nonpainful mass, approximately 7 cm long by 4 cm wide, was palpable close to midline, dorsal to the wings of the C1. Physical examination, including use of treats to encourage lateral head and neck movement, con rmed the presence of a restricted range of motion when the head and neck were turned to both sides, in particular the left. Dynamic gait assessment revealed mild left forelimb lameness and a neurological examination identi ed no signi cant de cits. Diagnostic imaging Digital radiography (Cuattro Slate 3; 68 kVs 12 mAs) of the cranial cervical vertebrae, using left-to-right lateral and oblique left-35 degree evaluation of the C1-C2 region (11 MHz linear transducer, GE logic) demonstrated a well-demarcated irregularly shaped hyperechoic mass extending between the planes of the soft tissues to a depth of 25 mm. As radiographical and ultrasonographical ndings were not consistent with cranial nuchal al. 2010; Abuja et al. 2014), extra-thecal mineralisation was suspected. Because of the gelding 's resistance to handling and manipulation, further investigation, such as intra-thecal analgesia of the nuchal bursa, was not attempted. Surgical investigation and excision of the calci ed mass was recommended. Surgical treatment Pre-operatively the administered cefquinome (Cobactan in a semi-closed circle anaesthetic system. The gelding was positioned in left lateral recumbency. The dorsal aspect of the right cranial cervical region was clipped and prepared in an aseptic manner, followed by the application of a sterile iodine dressing (Ioban8). A longitudinal incision was made on the right side of the neck along the palpable length of the mass, extending 10 cm caudally from the dorsal aspect of the wing of the The overlying ) was bluntly dissected and the fascial planes separated. Further sharp and blunt dissection was used to expose the calci ed mass, which was found to be entirely within the funicular part of the nuchal ligament. The complete (approximately 7 cm long) funicular part of the nuchal ligament, which contained the calci ed mass was sharply excised ( Fig 2 ). A small amount of aberrant calci ed tissue closely associated with the dorsal aspect of C1 was left in-situ to avoid excessive further dissection. An intraoperative, left-35 degree dorsal right-ventral oblique radiograph con rmed removal of the majority of the mass ( Fig 3 ). The remaining dead space was lavaged with sterile saline \u00a92017 3.5metric polyglactin 910 (Ethicon Vicryl9)inasimple continuous pattern. apposed using 3.5metric poliglecaprone 25(Ethicon Monocryl9)and a sterile dressing placed over the surgical site.

The horse became increasingly refractory to EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019treatment and euthanasia was elected almost a year after the surgery due to the inability to maintain soundness. Discussion The clinical outcome following complete excision of a portion of the funicular part of the nuchal ligament at this level does not appear to have been previously reported. The vertebrate ligamentum nuchae is an elastic structure on the dorsal midline between the occiput, the cervical vertebrae and the cranial thoracic spinous processes (Gellman 2002), providing both passive support for the head and neck and contributing to locomotion by storing and returning elastic strain energy during head and neck oscillations, thereby helping to reduce neck pitch excursions (Gellman and Bertram 2002; Gellman et al. 2002). The equine nuchal ligament is well-developed and structurally complex when compared to those in primates and carnivores. The dorsal funicular section is broad at its origin on the cranial thoracic spines and narrows to become cordlike towards its insertion on the skull, whereas the lamellar part is flat and sheet-like, inserting on the dorsal spines of the second to sixth cervical vertebrae, after which it is contiguous with the predominantly collagenous supraspinous ligament (Minns et al. 1973; Dunbar et al. 2008). Whilst a direct comparison cannot be made between bipeds and quadrupeds because of the different loads experienced by the nuchal ligament, complete resection of the human nuchal ligament is reported to increase flexion range of motion and decrease stiffness in flexion, although it increases the risk of cervical spine instability and malalignment (Takeshita et al. 2004). A recent case report found good recovery following complete resection of a portion of the nuchal ligament in a human patient with calcinosis circumscripta in the cranial cervical vertebrae (Sasaki et al. 2015). Likewise, no evidence of neck pain or instability was found post-operatively in the present case suggesting that the lamellar portion of the nuchal ligament and cervical musculature provide suf cient compensatory support for normal head and neck motion in equidae. Numerous disorders can cause neck pain or stiffness in equidae, including trauma, fractures of the cervical vertebrae (Lopez et al. 1997), diskospondylitis (Adams et al. 1985), neurological de cits (Mckelvey and Owen 1979; Marks 1999), osteoarthrosis-associated Dyson 2003) and supraspinous bursitis (Gaughan et al. 1988; Cohen et al. 1992; Hawkins and Fessler 2000). De nitive diagnosis can be challenging due to variability in clinical signs, which may be complicated by the presence of concurrent unrelated orthopaedic problems (Gaughan et al. 1988; Ricardi and Dyson 1993). In the current case, intra- thecal anaesthesia of the nuchal bursa was not attempted because of the gelding 's temperament and, in hindsight, may not have affected the clinical signs because the lesion was within the ligament. The decision to use fourth- generation antimicrobial therapy in this case was not undertaken lightly, however, because of the location of the lesion, the dead space left following its excision and the challenges in treating a surgical site infection in that location, particularly considering the animal 's temperament, broad- spectrum bactericidal perioperative antibiotic cover was considered necessary. Unfortunately, repeated intramuscular injection would not have been tolerated by the animal and other intravenous and per os antibiotics available at the timewere not deemed to provide suf cient broad-spectrum bactericidal coverage. Improvement in neck flexibility post- operatively was suggestive that the lesion in the nuchal ligament was at least contributory to the reported problem. Although forelimb lameness can be associated with cervical abnormalities (Ricardi and Dyson 1993), the multi-limb lameness was considered unlikely to be related to the lesion or excision of the nuchal ligament. Calcinosis circumscripta or tumoural calcinosis have been Hutchins Olsen and Chew 2006; Toth et al. 2009), including the horse. Characterised by solitary or multiple painless, periarticular masses, these lesions may be cystic and contain calcium hydroxyapatite crystals with amorphous calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. Calcinosis circumscripta can present in animals of all ages, however, it is more commonly identi ed in younger animals (Scott and Buerger 1988; Tafti et al. 2005; Mauldin and Peters-Kennedy 2016). Equine lesions are most commonly found lateral to the femorotibial joint (Goulden and O 'Callaghan 1980) and may be associated with the joint capsule (Dodd and Raker 1970; Hutchins 1972), though invasion of the middle carpal (Stone et al. 1990) and antebrachiocarpal joints have been described (Toth et al. 2009). In dogs, lesions are most often solitary and two cases close to the cervical vertebrae have been reported (Tafti et al. 2005). The pathogenesis of this disorder is poorly understood and multiple reports exist in both human and veterinary literature where these lesions occur, especially in the cervical spine, in the absence of known tissue injury or systemic metabolic mineral disorders (Lewis and Kelly 1990; Marks et al. 1991; McEwan et al. 1992; Tafti et al. 2005). Some cases have an obvious inciting cause, such as necrosis, in flammation, neoplasia or injury, whereas others may have concurrent abnormalities in calcium or phosphate metabolism, such as in cases of chronic renal failure or vitamin D toxicosis (Cotchin 1960; 1994; Gross 1997). Presumptive diagnosis may be made based on clinical signs and radiography, with other imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography, useful for delineating tissue margins (Milner 2009). De nitive diagnosis and staging of the lesion (Scott and Buerger 1988) is made on histopathological analysis, with lesions appearing as well-de ned cystic-like structures containing amorphous to granular basophilic materials, occasionally accompanied by peripheral granulomatous reaction and surrounded by varying amounts of brous connective tissue (Tafti et al. 2005). Lesions may progress from initially being fluctuant and cyst-like, to rmer with increased mineralisation and chondroid metaplasia (Mauldin and Peters-Kennedy 2016). Surgical excision is the only treatment described (Dodd and Raker 1970; Goulden and O 'Callaghan 1980) and prognosis is excellent following removal (Tafti et al. 2005), with rare recurrence of lesions (ojszczyk-Szczepaniak et al. 2008). Other differential diagnoses for this case included ossication of the nuchal ligament (Luo et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2011) and brocartilaginous pseudotumour, both of which are thought to occur as a result of prior trauma or chronic overload (Tsai et al. 2012). Equine onchocerciasis is another cause of \u00a92017 EDUCATION / JULY 20192019this is commonly found more caudally in the nuchal attachment of the thoracic vertebral spinous processes or in the region of the (Ottley et al. 1983). Cranial and caudal nuchal bursitis have been reported in the veterinary literature but were not associated with distinct well- circumscribed mineralised masses (Garcia-Lopez et al. 2010). Conclusion Calcinosis circumscripta can affect the funicular part of the nuchal ligament in the cervical region of equidae. Surgical excision should be curative, with no recurrence of the lesion observed at 6 months post-operatively in this case. Complete excision of a 7 cm length of the funicular part of the nuchal ligament at the level of C1 did not result in signi cant neck pain, instability or movement reduction, suggesting removal of a portion of the nuchal ligament may be safely performed if indicated.

Bruniges* , P. Milner and D. Bardell Institute of Veterinary Sciences, University of cross Dartmoor mare was referred to the clinic with marked lameness and swelling involving the left sti fle region. There was poor initial response to medical management and arthroscopic examination of the sti fle joint was performed under general anaesthesia. Following surgery, the lameness and swelling worsened and extremity compartment syndrome was suspected. A multimodal analgesia protocol was instigated to provide adequate analgesia and improved mobility, aiding the use of physical therapy in resolving the swelling. This report demonstrates the successful combination of nonsteroidal anti-in flammatories, paracetamol, ketamine infusion and epidural opioid administration to manage the clinical signs. The mare was discharged from hospital after 15 days and at short-term follow-up (3 months), there was no reported residual swelling or lameness. Introduction Compartment syndrome occurs when increased pressure within a tissue in an enclosed space compromises visceral and neuromuscular function within that area (Rorabeck and McGee 1990). This increased tissue pressure restricts local perfusion, leading to physiological dysfunction of cells, including cytokine release and oxygen free radical formation, ultimately resulting in cell death (Vegar-Brozovic and Stoic-Brezak 2006). Compartment syndrome may occur directly as a result of the disease process itself (haemorrhage, oedema, thrombosis), or iatrogenically as a result of external compression from improper surgical positioning, constrictive bandages or excessive fluid resuscitation (Nielsen and Whelan 2012). De nitive diagnosis requires measurement of intracompartmental pressure using a needle and manometer, wick catheter, slit catheter or noninvasive, near infrared spectroscopy (Rorabeck and McGee 1990; Garr et al. 1999; Nielsen and Whelan 2012). In a clinical setting, however, these tools may not be available and therefore diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical signs consistent with compartment syndrome (Rorabeck and McGee 1990; Nielsen and Whelan 2012). Compartment syndromes are well recognised in human medicine and have been documented in the thorax, abdomen and limb extremities (Nielsen and Whelan 2012). Skeletal muscle or extremity compartment syndrome (ECS) is the most widely recognised type in veterinary medicine and involves increases in pressure within fascial compartments surrounding limb muscles (Nielsen and Whelan 2012). Literature in the veterinary eld is mainly con ned to case reports (Sullins et al. 1987; Dodman et al. 1988; Norman et al. 1989; Nelson et al. 2015), butintracompartmental muscle pressures have been measured experimentally in horses (Lindsay et al. 1985; McDonell et al. 1985; Nielsen and Whelan 2012). Clinical signs of ECS include severe pain disproportionate to that expected for the injuries sustained, paresis, tenseness of the limb and weak or absent pulses in the affected area (Rorabeck and McGee 1990; Nielsen and Whelan 2012). Effective management of associated pain is essential and treatment with surgical decompression via fasciotomy is often required (Bae et al. 2001). Development of lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy and complex regional pain syndrome secondary to gluteal compartment syndrome was recently reported in the human literature, highlighting the potential for progression to chronic pain syndromes in these cases (Lederman et al. 2016). Femoral compartment syndrome secondary to intramuscular haemangiosarcoma has been described in two dogs (Bar-Am et al. 2006; Radke et al. 2006). There has also been a report of acute ECS development in the sti fle region of a Holstein cow following biopsy of an intramuscular haemangiosarcoma (Vogel et al. 2012). In equine medicine, ECS is most commonly reported associated with post- anaesthetic myopathy, particularly in the gluteal and et al. 1987; Dodman et al. 1988; Norman et al. 1989; Kobluk 1995), but has been described in the forelimb antebrachial region of two horses secondary to trauma at pasture (Nelson et al. 2015). To the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst case report of suspected ECS secondary to trauma in the pelvic limb of a horse and describes the pivotal role of multimodal pain management in the successful outcome of this case. Case history A 12-year-old Thoroughbred cross Dartmoor mare was referred to the clinic following a 3-day history of swelling around the left sti fle with progressively worsening lameness, secondary to a suspected traumatic episode. Treatment prior to referral had included 1.1 were identi ed on radiography by the referring veterinary surgeon, but synoviocentesis of the left femoropatellar joint yielded sanguinous fluid on two subsequent days. Clinical ndings On presentation, the mare was moderately lame (6/10; Stashak 2002) on the left pelvic limb at walk with marked \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd354 were present onexamination and allother ndings oftheleftfemoropatellar and inthe were found and femorotibial joints. Synoviocentesis ofthe leftfemoropatellar joint yielded a sanguinous sample consistent with haemarthrosis (Table 1). Treatment On admission tothe clinic, medical management improvement was evident after 24h,arthroscopic evaluation oftheleftfemoropatellar joint was performed under general anaesthesia. Atsurgery, marked synovial thehaematoma and biopsies taken from the synovium for culture. Phenylbutazone 4.4mg/kg bwt i.v.q. 12hwas administered and antimicrobials continued at microbiological culture results.

Haematology was otherwise unremarkable (Table 2). Three days after arthroscopy, thedemeanour ofthemare deteriorated and shewas extremely tothe lack ofimprovement inswelling or degree ofpain, development ofextremity compartment syndrome (ECS) within the fascial planes around the femoropatellar joint was suspected. Asdexamethasone resulted inno clinically appreciable improvement, this treatment was not repeated and asthe mare was too painful forphysical therapy tobeeffective, the analgesic protocol was analgesia was discontinued and theepidural catheter leftinsitu. The mare epidurally also commenced at0.8mg/ kgbwt/h. Nobacterial growth was observed insynovial fluid, or synovium following extended culture (>48h).Antimicrobial v 2 ofmixed demeanour signi cantly improved. The mare was able toambulate effectively and the swelling around the stifleand inguinal regions had reduced. The ketamine CRI was discontinued after 24hand epidural morphine administration was reduced to30mg q.12h4days after catheter before further reduction indose to15mgq.12h 2days. ofhospitalisation. Physical therapy was implemented, consisting oflocal tissue massage and in-hand walking three times daily for5-10min initially, increased to15min over the following week. Oral paracetamol was discontinued 5days after epidural catheter placement. Theepidural catheter was removed after 8days. Atthispoint, the mare was almost sound onthe leftpelvic limb with marked reduction inswelling evident (Fig4).Day to day pain assessment and analgesic management is summarised inTable 3. Outcome The mare was discharged 15days after tothe referral arthroscopy portals suture removal.TABLE 2:Haematology results two days after arthroscopy Parameter Result Reference interval Units White blood cells 6.22 4.3-14.8 9109/L Red blood cells / JULY 20192019were also recommended once theswelling had completely resolved. Atfollow-up 3months after hospital discharge, the referring veterinary surgeon reported that the horse was sound intheleftpelvic limb attrotinastraight line with no evidence oflameness after flexion oftheleftpelvic limb. The owner declined further ultrasonographic examination. Discussion This report describes the successful management ofa suspected case ofECS inthe pelvic limb ofahorse. Femoropatellar haemarthrosis and subcutaneous haematoma arthroscopic likely due to additional subcutaneous oedema formation inthe region. ECS has been described inman and animals with few case reports detailed inthe horse, although the fascial compartments oftheequine proximal pelvic limb have been described inanatomical literature (Sisson 1975). Most equine ECS case reports are related topost-anaesthetic myopathy with thegluteal and triceps muscles being most susceptible (Norman etal.1989; Nielsen Whelan Surgical cases, butappropriate pain management is paramount forasuccessful outcome. Through the use of multimodal pain management, physical therapy was able tobeinstigated, assisting intheresolution oftheclinical signs in this case without fasciotomy. Itispossible that femoropatellar joint sepsis contributed to the pain associated with this case and antimicrobial medication varied over thecourse oftreatment. Penicillin and gentamicin are considered rstline treatments forsynovial sepsis (Anon 2015), had been administered prior to referral and were continued assynovial sepsis had notbeen ruled outon admission. Intra-articular amikacin was administered atsurgery asan aminoglycoside togentamicin due to reported increases ingentamicin resistance inequine isolates (Johns and Adams 2015) and synovial infection remained a possibility atthisstage. Systemic antimicrobial treatment was continued atprevious doses whilst awaiting microbiological culture results. As no bacterial growth was observed in synovial fluidorsynovium following extended culture, it was considered unlikely that aseptic process was acontributing factor and antimicrobial medication was changed totrimethoprim and sulphadiazine asaprophylactic measure against infection viatheopen arthroscopic portals. Thiscombination is recommended asarstlinetreatment forcontaminated limb wounds (Anon 2015). Due tothe extreme nature ofthe swelling post- operatively, thechronic nature oftheinjury and indication of was considered. Haematological and biochemical allwithin normal limits with Whilst reductions inPTand APTT due topremature activation ofclotting factors may result from technical errors with sample acquisition and storage (Song etal.2016), evidence inman and dogs suggests that shortened PTand APTT may be associated with hypercoagulability and etal.2010; Song etal. 2016). Therefore, PTand APTT could have been measured on subsequent samples tomonitor these changes. Compartment syndrome results incellular hypoxia and necrosis through two proposed mechanisms. The 'arteriovenous pressure gradient theory 'describes how anincrease invenous pressure in acompartment reduces the arteriovenous pressure gradient and hence reduces oxygen delivery tothose tissues (Mars and Hadley 1998). Ischaemia-reperfusion injury also occurs where interstitial fluidpressure within acompartment initially rises above capillary pressure, preventing perfusion of tissues inthat compartment. Subsequent reperfusion leads to production ofreactive oxygen species inaddition toreduced oxygen delivery, resulting inacycle ofhypoxia, anaerobic metabolism and further vasoconstriction which continues to damage cells (Matsen and Krugmire 1978). Compartment syndrome isassociated with severe pain due toinflammation, increased intracompartmental pressure, ischaemic damage and tissue necrosis. Movement ofthe affected limb can help toencourage venous blood flowand hence movement offluidoutofaparticular compartment. In this case, the severity ofthe pain and swelling precluded physical therapy oftheaffected limb, hence augmenting the underlying condition. Thekey objective was tomodulate the associated pain thus allowing mobilisation ofthe limb, reduction and isbene cial induced ECS inrats and dogs Fig4:Photograph of caudal view of the pelvic limbs demonstrating marked reduction inswelling around left stifle/ thigh after 8days ofhospitalisation (immediately prior catheter removal). EVJLtd357 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019 demonstrated increased perfusion to the affected compartment, decreased muscle necrosis and lower intracompartmental pressures (Dabby et al. 1998; Manjoo et al. 2010). Both phenylbutazone and flunixin have been shown to reduce prostaglandin production in experimentally- induced in flammation in horses (Higgins et al. 1984; Lees and Higgins 1984) and the ef cacy of both drugs has been demonstrated for musculoskeletal pain (Johnson et al. 1993; Hamm et al. 1997; Kallings et al. 1999). Phenylbutazone was chosen in this case based on several factors including reduced cost compared with flunixin and thereforeanticipated improved owner compliance with potential long-term treatment. The degree of pain, potential requirement for systemic opioids, ongoing NSAID treatment, dietary changes and stabling during hospitalisation are additionally risk factors for developing colic (Senior et al. 2004; Williams et al. 2011; Scherrer et al. 2016). Flunixin is more likely to mask the cardiovascular changes associated with endotoxaemia, should this develop as a consequence, potentially delaying identi cation and appropriate intervention (King and Gerring 1989; Mair and Edwards 1998). Newer NSAIDs such as rocoxib could have been consideredTABLE 3: Day-to-day pain evaluation and analgesic management during hospitalisation Day (s) since admission to hospital Pain evaluation Analgesic management 0 6/10 lame left pelvic limb (LPL) \u00814.4 with around left per os q. 12 h \u0081Distal portal sutures removed and cold packing/hosing commenced 3 8/10 lame LPL lame LPL Low head carriage and 'low ' ear position with tense face.

There is, however, insuf cient evidence for superior efcacy or safety of rocoxib compared with phenylbutazone when used at recommended doses (Doucet et al. 2008). Concurrent glucocorticoid and NSAID administration is contraindicated in drug datasheets due to potential increased risk of gastric ulceration (Anon 2017). Experimental studies in dogs concluded that concurrent administration of NSAIDs and glucocorticoids increased the risk of developing gastric mucosal erosions observed via endoscopy and faecal occult blood measurement (Dow et al. 1990; Boston et al. 2003; Narita et al. 2007). Evidence supporting NSAID administration as a cause of equine glandular gastric ulceration syndrome (EGGUS) at a population level is weak (Sykes and Jokisalo 2015). Although there is potentially an increased risk of EGGUS with concurrent NSAID and corticosteroid administration, the authors felt that this risk was outweighed by the bene to fa potential reduction in periarticular swelling and as colic was a concern due to the aforementioned factors, the horse was monitored closely for signs of abdominal pain. Although not licensed in horses, oral paracetamol was added to the treatment protocol when clinical signs did not improve with phenylbutazone. There is a paucity of literature on the analgesic ef cacy of paracetamol in horses, but there is a report of its successful use as an adjunctive analgesic to phenylbutazone in a pony with acute laminitis (West et al. 2011). Mechanism of action is different from NSAIDs as analgesia is thought to be centrally mediated, involving both cannabinoid and serotonergic pathways (Oscier and Milner 2009). Ketamine is a widely used anaesthetic agent in horses, but its use as an analgesic in horses is not commonly reported. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is believed to mediate analgesia by preventing transmission of pain stimuli and modulating pain perception. In particular, ketamine may prevent hyperalgesia and central pain sensitisation, preventing development of chronic pain (Koizuka et al. 2005; Latremoliere and Woolf 2009). Reports demonstrating this bene t in horses are, however, limited to pain management in chronic laminitis (Jones et al. 2007; Muir 2010). Additional potential bene ts of ketamine that have been demonstrated in rodent and human experimental studies include potentiation of opioid analgesia, as well as reduction of opioid tolerance and side effects (Inturrisi 1994; Lauline et al. 2002; Shulte et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2009), but these effects have not been demonstrated in horses. It has been suggested that ketamine infusion rates ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mg/kg bwt/ h in horses are likely to result in analgesia whilst reducing central sensitisation and hyperalgesia (Fielding et al. 2006; Muir 2010). As chronic pain is a reported consequence of compartment syndrome in man (Lederman et al. 2016), in the authors 'opinion, it was logical to include ketamine in the analgesic protocol. Lameness dramatically reduced following 12 h of ketamine infusion at 0.8 mg/kg bwt/h in this case, although concurrent epidural opioid administration precluded the ability to determine the analgesic effect of each drug individually. Whilst the analgesic ef cacy of opioids, particularly mu receptor agonists, in man and other veterinary species is well reported, there are few studies that convincingly demonstrate the ef cacy of opioid analgesics in horses. Inconsistent results and discrepancies exist betweenexperimental and clinical studies (Lowe 1978; Kamerling et al. 1985, 1988; Brunson and Majors 1987; Bennett and Steffey 2002). Intra-articular morphine could have been considered during arthroscopy in this case as this has been shown to reduce lameness scores in horses with experimentally- induced synovitis compared with systemic morphine (Lindegaard et al. 2010). However, the authors considered the administration of systemic and epidural opioids preoperatively in addition to intra-articular bupivacaine suf cient analgesia. Studies investigating epidural opioid administration have provided some of the most convincing evidence supporting use of opioids in providing analgesia in horses (Valverde et al. 1990; Robinson 1994; Bennett Steffey 2002; van Loon 2012). Epidural opioid administration can produce segmental analgesia, resulting in a higher local concentration with longer analgesic duration as well as fewer CNS and cardiorespiratory side effects compared with systemic opioid administration (Natalini and Robinson 2000; Torske and Dyson 2000). Lipid solubility of opioids can affect onset and duration of analgesia when administered into the epidural space. Relatively hydrophilic compounds such as morphine have a slow onset of action but longer duration of action than more lipophilic agents such as methadone and fentanyl (Cousins and Mather 1984; Natalini and Driessen 2007). It is for this reason that methadone and morphine were administered concurrently following epidural catheter placement in this case. Methadone provides rapid onset of analgesia, whilst duration is enhanced with the inclusion of morphine (Olbrich and Mosing 2003; Martin-Flores et al. 2014). Epidural administration of opioids was considered likely to be of bene t in this case to target the source of pain in the left pelvic limb, to allow a more convenient dosing interval of 12 instead of 4 h with systemic morphine and to reduce reported systemic side effects associated with opioid usage in horses (Martin-Flores et al. 2014). Given the increasing severity of lameness and poor response to systemic opioids post-operatively, epidural opioid administration could have been considered earlier in this case. Placement of an epidural catheter facilitates regular opioid administration without the need to perform repeated needle punctures. Complications associated with the use of epidural catheters in horses include premature dislodgement, obstruction, leakage, in flammation around the catheter site, generalised muscle tremors, ataxia, pruritus and epidural Natalini 2002; Martin et al. 2003; Steblaj et al. 2013). The horse in this case was cross-tied after epidural catheter placement to reduce risk of dislodgement. Lameness dramatically reduced and mobility improved within 12 h of epidural opioid administration, but simultaneous commencement of epidural opioids and ketamine CRI made it dif cult to assess which was most bene cial or whether there was a synergistic effect. Assessment of pain in equids can be challenging and there is no universally accepted or validated pain scale in horses. Numerous pain scales have been designed to try to quantitatively assess pain due to various pathologies (Pritchett et al. 2003; Bussi Loon and van Dierendonck 2015). Lameness scoring (Stashak 2002) was performed in this case as an indicator of improved mobility and hence response to analgesia, but recent research has focused on assessment of facial expression to interpret pain (Dalla Costa et al. 2014, \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd359 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / Gleerup et al. 2015). 'Low 'positioning of ears and a tense stare were identi ed in this case which were considered indicative of pain (Gleerup et al. 2015). Pain was assessed largely subjectively in this case and managed accordingly, although it would have been advantageous to adopt a more structured and consistent method of assessing pain to monitor progress and response to analgesic medication more quantitatively. Palpation of the swollen area could have been performed to determine how the mare reacted. This can be assessed more objectively with the use of pressure algometers or von Frey laments, but these are not readily available in a clinical setting (Gleerup and Lindegaard 2016). An Equine Pain Scale, incorporating pertinent ndings from previous studies, which is quick and relatively easy to perform in a clinical setting, has recently been proposed (Gleerup and Lindegaard 2016). This could therefore be considered in similar cases in the future. In conclusion, provision of multimodal analgesia played a pivotal role in the management of a suspected case of ECS. Reduction in pain allowed the mare to be walked out of the stable regularly, assisting in the resolution of swelling and leading to marked clinical improvement over a short period. Short-term outcome was favourable in this case but long-term follow-up of this and similar cases in horses is recommended to identify any sequelae such as development of chronic pain, muscle contracture and sensory neuropathy as reported in man and dogs (Taylor and Tangner 2007; Frink et al. 2010; Lederman et al. 2016).

PP-AI-US-0222 2/2019 Multimodal analgesia, a fashionable term or evidence-based medicine? J. P. A. M. van Loon* Department of Equine Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands. *Corresponding author email: j.p.a.m.vanloon@uu.nl The different levels of nociception (from Latin nocere 'to harm or hurt ', i.e. the physiological processes underlying the sensation of pain) comprise the peripheral nociceptors and their activation ( 'transduction '), activation of afferent bres that transmit electrical signals from the peripheral tissues towards the spinal cord ( 'transmission '), further processing of the signals in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord ('modulation '), and nally, transport to the brainstem and higher brain centres for conscious and emotional experience ('perception '). These processing steps are regulated by a vast amount of different channels and receptors and their various agonists and antagonists that all interact in ascending and descending pain pathways. Multimodal analgesia is based on the concept of combining different analgesic techniques that act by different mechanisms at these different levels of the peripheral and central nervous system. This results in additive or synergistic effects with reduced adverse side-effects of the individual pharmaca that are used in the protocol (Kehlet and Dahl 1993). The American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Acute Pain Management advocates the use of multimodal analgesia (Apfelbaum et al. 2004) and numerous studies have been conducted to study the effects of multimodal analgesic strategies in different types of pain, especially for acute and post-operative pain (Beverly et al. 2017; Wick et al. 2017). Bruniges et al. (2019) present a horse with suspected extremity compartment syndrome in the pelvic limb and the use of a multimodal analgesic protocol in the current issue of Equine Veterinary Education. They describe the combination of nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs (phenylbutazone) with constant rate infusion (CRI) of ketamine, epidurally applied morphine and methadone and orally administered paracetamol. This case report comprises several interesting aspects. Although paracetamol is the corner stone of a lot of analgesic regimens in human species and has approved efcacy in various types of pain (Sjoukes et al. 2016; Stephens et al. 2016; Wiffen et al. 2017b), there is no evidence for analgesic ef cacy in horses. As described by Bruniges et al. (2019), one earlier case report about a laminitic pony that was treated with paracetamol has been published (West et al. 2011). Despite the lack of evidence for analgesic efcacy, there is abundant literature on the oral bioavailability of paracetamol in horses, as it has been used as a marker for gastric emptying in horses (Doherty et al. 1998). Oral bioavailability in horses has been studied by Neirinckx et al. (2010) and was over 90%. Based on similarities between man and mammals (analogy postulate), paracetamol could be a very useful analgesic in horses as well. Another very important component of the analgesic protocol by Bruniges et al. (2019) is the epidurally applied morphine. The authors have chosen to use the lumbosacral approach for application of the epidural catheter. Thisapproach for placement of subarachnoid or epidural catheters has been described with very good visual support by Natalini (2010). Although feasible, this approach is technically rather demanding and there is a risk of inadvertent spinal placement. As a good alternative, the caudal approach that uses epidural entrance of the catheter at the junction of the rst and second coccygeal vertebra has also been described in horses (Natalini 2010). When the catheter is advanced far enough towards the lumbosacral junction and the administered volume is adequate, the ef cacy of this approach will also be sufcient. Combined with the CRI of ketamine and the oral administration of phenylbutazone, the patient in the case report by Bruniges et al. (2019) improved very well over time. The biggest improvement was seen after addition of the CRI of ketamine and the epidural administration of morphine and methadone. This emphasises the added and possibly synergistic effects of the different drugs, showing the bene ts of the multimodal approach. Other interesting analgesic drugs that have been extensively studied in humans that could potentially have been used in the patient described by Bruniges et al. (2019) are tramadol and gabapentin. Both drugs have been thoroughly investigated for treatment of neuropathic pain in people (Duehmke et al. 2017; Wiffen et al. 2017a) and especially gabapentin showed good ef cacy in human patients with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Zhai et al. (2016) described analgesic and opioid-sparing effects of gabapentin in acute post-operative pain after orthopaedic surgery in people. Both tramadol and gabapentin, although not licensed for horses, have been investigated in a few studies in horses with laminitis. Guedes et al. (2012) describe the analgesic effects of tramadol in a dosage of 5 mg/kg, twice daily and orally administered in 15 horses with chronic laminitis. Tramadol showed mild improvement of limb loading and these analgesic effects were signi cantly increased when tramadol was combined with a CRI of ketamine (0.6 mg/kg/h for 6 h a day for 3 days). This study shows clear synergistic effects of tramadol and ketamine, indicating the positive effects of a multimodal approach. In the study of Guedes et al. (2016), two dosages of tramadol (5 and 10 mg/kg twice daily, orally administered) are investigated in four horses with chronic laminitis. The higher dosage showed signi cant improvement of forelimb loading. Caldwell et al. (2015) assessed the analgesic effects of two dosages of gabapentin (5 and 10 mg/kg, orally administered three times daily over a period of 2 weeks) in six horses with chronic laminitis. They did not observe any signi cant improvement in lameness with both dosages of gabapentin, but the number of included horses was relatively low and the chosen dosages were not supported by pharmacokinetic studies. Guedes et al. (2013) described a \u00a92017 doi: 10.1111/eve.12822laminitic horse in a case report that did not bene t from treatment with flunixin combined with gabapentin and that improved dramatically when an experimental drug, the soluble epoxide to Guedes et al. (2017) measured increased soluble epoxide hydrolase activity in the digital laminae of laminitic horses compared with healthy horses; furthermore, they assessed analgesic efcacy of the soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor in a group of 10 horses with chronic laminitis. The current case report by Bruniges et al. (2019) and all the aforementioned small clinical studies and case reports show that various analgesic drugs can be combined in multimodal protocols for horses with acute or chronic pain. The need for further prospective, randomised clinical studies into the analgesic ef cacy of individual hydrolase inhibitors, ketamine, opioids, etc., is urgent. From the human meta- analyses and systematic reviews, it can be learned that large clinical studies are needed that could for instance compare current analgesic treatment with nonsteroidals with current treatment plus analgesic adjuncts in horses. If veterinarians and researchers could collaborate more intensely and could participate more in multicentre randomised clinical trials to assess multimodal analgesic protocols in for instance horses with laminitis, trauma and post-operative analgesia, we could learn much more about analgesic ef cacy of these very interesting and promising analgesic drugs. With the increasing number of scienti c studies on objective pain recognition in horses and the availability of validated pain scales for different types of pain, analgesic ef cacy of different analgesic protocols can be objectively monitored. Combining evidence-based multimodal analgesic protocols with objective pain assessment tools could further improve the wellbeing of our equine cases and could bring veterinary practice to the next level.

Steel Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Werribee;Advantage Equine Veterinary Practice, Ascot Vale; and\u00a7Urorenal and Vascular severe left hindlimb lameness and colic-like signs lasting 30 -60 min post-exercise was diagnosed with unilateral internal aorto-iliac thrombosis. The thrombus was identi ed using transrectal ultrasonography in the terminal aorta and was initially thought to extend into the left external iliac artery. However, attempted thrombectomy via a left femoral arteriotomy performed under general anaesthesia using thrombectomy and angioplasty catheters was unsuccessful, as the thrombus was located in the left internal iliac artery. Transrectal ultrasound evaluation was repeated monthly for 12 months post-operatively during which time the gelding remained asymptomatic at rest. As removal of thrombi in the external but not internal iliac artery may be possible, correct diagnosis of the location of the thrombus is critical in preventing unnecessary attempts at surgical correction. The aetiology remains unknown, but altered haemodynamics within the abdominal aorta with mechanical stresses during intense exercise are proposed as a cause of thrombus formation. The sequential monitoring of this case also con flicts the assumption that thrombi in this location propagate over time as partial regression was observed 6 months after referral and 9 months after onset of clinical signs. Introduction Aorto-iliac thrombosis is an uncommonly diagnosed, reportedly progressive vascular condition of the horse of unknown aetiology (Rijkenhuizen et al. 2009). Clinical signs include an exercise-induced hindlimb lameness which generally resolves promptly with the cessation of exercise (Azzie 1969; Maxie and Physick-Sheard 1985), decreased digital pulses and saphenous ll and a palpably cooler affected limb (Rijkenhuizen et al. 2009). A diagnosis is most commonly made via transrectal ultrasonography with or without Doppler visualising the thrombus in situ (Reef et al. 1987), nuclear scintigraphy (Boswell et al. 1999; Duggan et al. 2004) or at necropsy (Oyamada et al. 2007). The prognosis is generally considered poor (Tillotsen and Kopper 1966; Branscomb 1968; Brama et al. 1996), but recent advances in surgical thrombectomy techniques may alter prior practitioner conceptions (Hilton et al. 2008; Rijkenhuizen et al. 2009). Medical therapy has previously been attempted with varying success (Branscomb 1968; Duggan et al. 2004). Morerecently, attempts at surgical removal with the use of balloon angioplasty (Hilton et al. 2008) and graft thrombectomy catheters (Brama et al. 1996; Rijkenhuizen et al. 2009) via a transverse femoral arteriotomy have been successful, with up to 65% of patients regaining athletic activity (Rijkenhuizen et al. 2009). Despite this, the prognosis is still generally considered poor, particularly in cases with bilateral involvement (Maxie and Physick-Sheard 1985; Boswell et al. 1999). This is not the rst reported case of aorto-iliac thrombosis involving the internal iliac artery in the horse, although cases more commonly involve the external iliac artery (Warmerdam 1998; Oyamada et al. 2007). The purpose of this report is to highlight the importance of accurate diagnosis of thrombus location before surgical treatment is attempted, discuss potential aetiologies which have not previously been explored in the literature and question the assumption that this disease is progressive. Case details History and diagnosis A 4-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was referred to the University of Melbourne 's Equine Centre with a history of poor performance, left hindlimb lameness and clinical signs of colic following a race start. Moderate left hindlimb lameness at the walk was observed following swimming exercise 3 months prior to presentation, with signs resolving after a 30-60 min period of rest. A complete blood count and serum biochemistry were unremarkable. Swimming exercise was ceased and the horse continued to be exercised under saddle for 3 weeks prior to racing, where he then performed below expectations. Following this race he was severely left hindlimb lame, appeared distressed with colic-like signs and became recumbent which resolved following the administration of flunixin meglumine ([Flumav1] No abnormalities were detected on lameness examination the following day, however, a left hindlimb lameness could be induced with further swimming exercise. The referring veterinarian performed a transrectal ultrasound examination and a thrombus in the abdominal aorta and left iliac artery identi ed. On presentation digital pulses in the left hindlimb were palpable and within normal limits. Saphenous ll was present \u00a92017 EVJ onalunge rein. Cardiac was performed atthecanter onthelunge rein forapproximately 30min. NoECG abnormalities were noted lameness could notbeinduced. Digital pulses, revealed egg count indicated transrectal with a7.5MHz linear transducer, anirregularly shaped, smooth margined, crescent- shaped mass was identi ed within the left external (presumed) iliac artery extending from thequadrifurcation of the abdominal aorta. The mass was adherent tothe dorsolateral margin of the and occluded arterial diameter (Fig1) extending from theaortic branch 10cm. echogenicity echogenic arterial blood. Blood flow was visualised moving unimpeded down the ventromedial aspect ofthe artery. Adiagnosis was subsequently made of unilateral aorto-iliac thrombosis involving the terminal aorta and left external iliac artery. Given theocclusal diameter, presumed location and impact on performance, plans for surgical thrombectomy were made. Medical therapy was not attempted given the chronicity and sizeofthethrombus. Attempted surgical correction The positioned inleftlateral recumbency withthe tilted toadorsolateral abduction tissue, centred over thesitewhere the saphenous todeep tissues approximately 15cm proximal tothe femoropatellar joint. Soft dissection was performed down tothe femoral triangle exposing thefemoral artery, which was then mobilised a0.5cmtransverse incision was made, with haemorrhage cleared from the surgical eld using suction. A50cm6FFogarty/C226graft thrombectomy catheter7with anextended spiral diameter of6.0mm and retracted passed proximally through the transverse arteriotomy site the Fogarty/C226thru-lumen embolectomy catheter7,with a maximum inflated diameter of 14mm, with corresponding size 8Fintroducer and 0.038 inch diameter guide wire was then passed proximally inattempts toengage thethrombus. When thiswas also unsuccessful, atransrectal ultrasound examination was repeated which clearly identi ed the catheter inthe external iliac artery, with the thrombus visible inthe adjacent internal iliac artery (Fig2).Further attempts atthrombus removal were aborted due to inaccessibility oftheinternal iliac artery. The arteriotomy site was Post-operative management Recovery from general anaesthesia was assisted with ropes and was uneventful. Administration ofprocaine penicillin and commenced immediately post-operatively, but adjunctive treatment with acetylsalicylic acid and lowmolecular weight heparin was was notremoved and hence theriskforfurther thrombogenic foci not applicable. The only complication observed was the formation ofamoderately sized seroma atthe incision site diagnosed via transcutaneous subsided over 7days. Sequential ultrasonographic evaluation The gelding was subsequently retired from racing. The thrombus was assessed viatransrectal ultrasonography and colour flowDoppler monthly with the size, shape, margins, opacity and con guration compared. Over 5months, the thrombus remained atamaximal occlusal diameter of approximately 60% area aorta, and theright-sided vessels remained unaffected. However, after initial presentation the thrombus had regressed of35% via ultrasound observed. No other abnormalities (Azzie 1969), with no more comprehensive ornew data available. The condition is repeatedly described inveterinary texts (Reef and McGuirk 1996; Young ofthe disease inthe last 20years. Thoroughbred racehorses are over represented, presumably due tohigh-intensity exercise exacerbating clinical signs coupled with the close observation ofthese animals (Maxie and Physick-Sheard 1985). Although reported infoals and geriatric horses, horses ofracing age areover represented again likely reflecting the in-work racehorse demographic (Moore etal.1998; Duggan etal.2004). No denitive pathogenesis larval migration etal.2006). The role strongly advocate parasitism asthecause ofcirculatory disturbances inthe abdominal aorta, associating the prevalence ofparasitism with increased anthelmintic the subjectively decreased incidence Conversely, S.vulgaris larvae have a forthis gelding, hehad asigni cant economicvalue and had been housed atreputable farms that have well-established anthelmintic programmes. The limitations ofparasitism, it isconsidered anunlikely contributing factor (Nielsen etal. 2013). The incidence ofclinical disease inmales has been consistently higher inprevious reports (Azzie 1969, 1972; Maxie and Physick-Sheard 1985), the reason forwhich remains unknown. Hormonal influences have been proposed insimilar human conditions with low oestrogen levels associated with reduced brinolysin production and anincreased incidence ofthrombosis, suggesting that high androgen levels may be important (Azzie 1969). Authors have also queried whether collateral supply tothehindlimbs viatheovarian and uterine arteries inmares require more severe vascular obstruction prior toclinical signs observed (Maxie and Physick-Sheard also bethat performance author hasproposed ahereditary predisposition, with one stallion producing sixaffected progeny and another mare producing four (Azzie 1969). (Schoeman 1999). Acardiac examination conducted inthisgelding didnot reveal any abnormalities, however, anECG was performed atacanter rather than during strenuous exercise due tothe riskofinducing severe lameness and distress. Cardiovascular disturbances altering blood flow and contributing toarterial and cardiac thrombosis through outinhorses with thrombosis. propose most likely cause ofthrombus formation inathletic horses isdue tomechanical stresses and secondary alterations inhaemodynamics. The dorsal wall of the abdominal aorta isonthe outer circumference ofthe spinal arc during flexion, with the internal iliac arteries and branches closely adhered tothe deep sacral movement inrelation toadjacent structures. (tunica and / JULY 20192019Merritt 2002). When the normal laminar blood flow becomes turbulent, platelets are brought into contact with the endothelium and the retarded in flow of clotting factor inhibitors may permit an environment for thrombus formation (Kiyomura et al. 2006). In addition, the catecholamine release at the onset of exercise in horses is also associated with splenic contraction and a signi cant increase in haematocrit (Young 2004), which could theoretically predispose to thrombus formation as described in pregnant women with haemoconcentration (Kiyomura et al. 2006). A recent review of the human literature assessing sports- related vascular insuf ciency in cyclists supports the theory of alterations in haemodynamics, postulating that the main aetiological factor is mechanical strain secondary to posture and performance intensity (di Alencar et al. 2013). Lesions were commonly identi ed in the external and internal iliac arteries, with 81.5% (119/146) of cases being male and 18.5% (27/146) being female. Tortuosity caused by flexion of the coxofemoral joint and arterial compression by the psoas muscle during pedalling are the proposed factors responsible for blood flow reductions, with increased arterial tension resulting in endothelial damage, stenosis and claudication. It is also suggested that a combination of the repetitive movements and vascular compression causes the endothelium to convert from an antithrombogenic to a prothrombotic state, resulting in the production of bronectin and von Willebrand factor (di Alencar et al. 2013). Unlike the horse, the primary lesion is endo brotic stricture of vessels, which can cause secondary arterial thrombosis if severe. Although different manifestations of occlusion, similar factors may contribute to aorto-iliac thrombosis in the horse. A diagnosis of aorto-iliac thrombosis is most commonly made via transrectal ultrasonography. The thrombus location in this case was incorrectly identi ed before surgery, resulting in unnecessary patient morbidity and potential cost to the client. Although the dif culties of imaging the iliac arteries are described (Edwards and Edward Allen 1988; M.B. Whitcomb, Personal Communication 2016), little information is available to the practitioner on how to ascertain the difference transrectally between the internal and external iliac arteries. Anatomically, the aortic quadrifurcation occurs on dorsal midline at the level of the fth or sixth lumbar vertebrae. The internal iliac arteries pass caudally under the wings of the sacrum, ventrally along the pelvic surface of the ilial body and along the ventral border of the iliac head of the obturatorius internus , before the caudal gluteal pudendal arteries which supply the gluteal musculature (Sisson et al. 1975). The external iliac artery branches from the abdominal aorta at the level of the fth lumbar vertebrae generally cranial to the origin of the internal, but individual variation may result in some branching at the level of the most caudal lumbar vertebrae. The external iliac artery travels down the side of the pelvic inlet adjacent to the tendon of the psoas minor before reaching the level of the cranial border of the pubis and continuing down the distal limb as the femoral artery (Sisson et al. 1975). The anatomical landmarks should be identi ed ultrasonographically to ensure the correct vessel is identi ed to aid in treatment decision making. Aorto-iliac thrombosis is repeatedly referred to as a continually progressive vascular disease (Maxie and Physick-Sheard 1985; Edwards and Edward Allen 1988;Rijkenhuizen et al. 2009) and has historically carried a poor prognosis (Tillotsen and Kopper 1966; Branscomb 1968; Brama et al. 1996). The sequential monitoring of this case showed no lesion propagation and an eventual reduction in thrombus size and degree of arterial occlusion, consistent with brotic reorganisation and contracture (Reef 1998). The reduction could also be due to thrombus recanalisation following the proteolytic activity of recruited in flammatory cells coupled with mechanical retraction and proangiogenic enhancement as postulated in the human literature (Chabasse et al. 2015). Although the gelding has yet to be trialled under strenuous exercise, given the reduction in size and minimal impedance to blood flow, the prognosis for returning to high-level performance should be considered fair. Although the aetiopathogenesis of aorto-iliac thrombosis remains unknown, the over representation of the disease in racehorses suggests mechanical alterations in haemodynamics as a major contributing factor. Aorto-iliac thrombosis is a differential diagnosis of exercise-induced hindlimb lameness and efforts should be made to ensure correct lesion localisation to prevent unnecessary efforts to remove the thrombus surgically. With recent thrombectomy applications from the human eld in addition to adjunctive medical therapy, there is no reason to encompass this disease as carrying a poor prognosis in all cases. Furthermore, the spontaneous reduction in thrombus size contradicts prior assumptions that the disease is progressive. Authors 'declaration of interests Authors declare no con flicts of interest.

Almost a fth of the population over the age of 65 has intermittent claudication (Diehm et al. 2004). The prevalence of the disease in horses is unknown because the majority of patients are asymptomatic, show vague symptoms or remain undiagnosed. It is likely that the true prevalence in horses is higher than suspected, due to the unawareness of the practitioner. Despite complementary diagnostic imaging techniques such as ultrasonography (Doppler) and scintigraphy being available, determining the correct diagnosis is still challenging because standard diagnostic algorithms may not discover rare diseases due to their low prevalence, and unless the veterinarian is triggered by the (a)speci c symptoms, a lot of patients with thrombosis stay undiagnosed. Extensive diagnostic tests will be repeated, imaging studies conducted, and altogether, the veterinarian -patient relationship suffers. As soon as the symptoms are pathognomonic then the triad of symptoms are memorised and diagnosis will be made, however, rather unspeci c symptoms like reducing speed just before nishing (for instance Trotter, Thoroughbred), or knocking down the last sprung are dif cult to distinguish for the veterinarian as a consequence of thrombosis. The differential diagnosis of these symptoms is usually broad. The saying 'You only treat what you see, and you only see what you know ', might be applicable. As soon as veterinarians become familiar with diagnosing the disease, the number of cases increases and more cases are referred for surgery. As with all uncommon diseases, all available literature is systematically quoted and so the assumed fact that Thoroughbreds have higher prevalence of this disease might actually be incorrect because most of the reports have originated from veterinarians mainly working with Thoroughbreds (Azzie 1969; Maxie and Physick-Sheard 1985). The experience of the authors is different. They were consulted on 47 horses, of which 37 horses were operated on, with an average age of 9.5 years, and 38% stallions, 35% geldings and relatively low percentage (26%) of mares; 38 Warmbloods and two riding ponies, ve Thoroughbreds, one Trakehner and one Lipizzaner. If we would have been the rst authors to describe the disease, it might have been quoted that thrombosis occurs mainly in Warmblood horses. So, probably it is a disease occurring in many breeds. In this issue, Lloyd et al. (2017) describe the examination and course of a patient with intermittent claudication. This case report nicely illustrates the clinical and diagnostic imaging features and their interpretation, and the unawareness of the necessity to perform ultrasonography of the femoral artery before surgical management.If clinical symptoms occur, the main complaint is intermittent claudication and the diagnosis is based on a classic history of progressive lameness that occurs after exercise, which is quickly relieved by rest and is reproducible. However, a spectrum of symptoms can occur, the severity of which depends on the extent of the occlusion and perhaps the available collateral circulation. If the external iliac artery and/or femoral artery is occluded for more than 60% exercise-induced reproducible lameness that subsides with rest can occur. Pain usually occurs distal to the arterial narrowing or obstruction. In speci c cases, even pain at rest can be present and sometimes the induced pain is so severe that the horse is presented with colic symptoms, profuse sweating and reluctance to stand. Pain develops because of inadequate blood flow. If the internal artery is occluded and not the external, then different symptoms might occur as described in human patients, like erectile dysfunction secondary to reduced internal iliac perfusion. Decreased blood flow to the internal iliac and following the internal pudendal artery (with the end branches: middle penis artery and the artery of the penis) can decrease the perfusion pressure and arterial flow to the sinusoidal spaces of the penis, thus increasing the time to maximal erection and decreasing the rigidity of the erect penis (blood supply of branches from the internal pudendal artery as well as the obturatory artery) (Dean and Lue 2005; Rayt et al . 2008). The internal iliac artery divides into the caudal gluteal and internal pudendal arteries, and thus reduced perfusion from the terminal branch arteries to the muscles of the croup and gluteal regions could result in soreness and intermittent lameness. As far as the authors are aware, no clinical reports have been written on whether complete obstruction of the internal iliac artery is associated with clinical signs. Based on our ultrasonographical ndings, horses which underwent a thrombectomy of the external iliac and femoral artery and revealed an additional occlusion of the internal iliac artery were able to perform as previously. Ultrasonography of the aorta and the iliac arteries provides information about haemodynamics; it is noninvasive and highly experience-dependent. Examination is performed via a transrectal approach with a linear or small microconvex probe. A microconvex probe allows easier rotation in the rectum for transversal and longitudinal imaging. Prior to imaging, each of the vessels should be manually identi ed and examined for abnormal size and pulse quality. The terminal aorta divides at its end into the two internal iliac arteries ( Figs 1 and 2 ). Cranially, the external iliac arteries emerge from the aorta to continue as femoral arteries more distally. Thrombi are recognised by anechoic to echogenic material in the lumen and blood flow is imaged and can be measured by Doppler method (Fig 3 \u00a92017 acomplete especially surgery, femoral arteries should beimaged from the proximomedial aspect ofthethigh.

Theformation ofcollateral circulation justcaudal tothebifurcation. The leftside has normal areoccluded. Thrombus Femoral 20192019In human patients, occlusion of the aortoiliac segment is bypassed naturally by several visceral and parietal collateral channels. Each of these pathways helps to maintain perfusion to the lower extremities. The anatomic location of the occlusion directly affects which pathway will develop, the systemic circulatory pathway or the visceral circulatory pathway. The visceral arterial anastomotic connections are most prominent in distal aortic lesions, including lesions of the aortic bifurcation and common iliac arteries (Hardman et al. 2011). In horses, no collateral visceral pathway has been demonstrated but it seems likely that they will be formed. In one case report of femoral occlusion, collateral blood flow has been described (Warmerdam 1998); blood flow was imaged in the distal femoral artery only provided by a con fluent vessel just distal to a thrombus. In chronic cases, the authors have observed diffuse blood flow in the area around the femoral artery, which was usually not suf cient to abolish clinical signs. In human patients, collateral circulation via pathways in aortoiliac occlusive disease is identi ed by using CT angiography, a technique which is not used in horses until now. There are three primary in fluences recognised which act together to predispose to thrombus formation, the so-called Virchow triad ( Mitchell and Cotran 2003) .These are (i) endothelial injury, (ii) stasis or turbulent blood flow and (iii) blood hypercoagulability. Although pathogenic theories have been suggested varying from parasitic endothelial lesions ( Strongylus vulgaris ) (Oyamada mechanical endothelial lesions with loosened thrombi that occlude the bifurcation, speci cally the aortic-iliac bifurcation (Boswell et al. 1999), it still remains speculation. New assumptions have been made by Lloyd et al. (2019) based on a literature review and one case. The challenge is that it is a chronic disease and it might be useful to look at the aorta of all dissected horses to nd out in how many cases a thrombus can be found and how far it extends. Treatment remains a challenge, also because we have to deal with a chronic problem, although some cases have severe acute signs due to a loosened floating thrombus that acutely occludes the external iliac or femoral artery. In all the cases operated on the thrombus has had its origin in the aorta and slowly grows in the direction of the bifurcation. It might be possible for a thrombus to start cranial to the mesenteric arteries and occlude these arteries resulting in ischaemia of the intestine. While extending caudally, the external and internal iliac arteries can be partly or totally occluded. The slow-growing lesion in the external iliac arteries can lead to decreased or no blood flow to the femoral artery, resulting in a decreased pulse, while isolated occlusion of the internal iliac artery may present with normal femoral pulses. The goal of treatment is to eliminate ischaemic symptoms and prevent progression to vascular occlusion. In partially occluded femoral arteries, this might be obtained by medical treatment, like the administration of pentoxifylline, a methylxanthine derivative, a haemorheologically active agent. In patients with peripheral arterial disease, pentoxifylline has been reported to improve abnormal erythrocyte deformability, reduce blood viscosity, and decrease platelet hypercoagulability (Weitz et . 1996; Kabbesh et al. 2012). The bene cial effect of aspirin is most likely due to prevention or retardation of platelet thrombogenesis on the surface of the thrombus and maybe cilostazol might be an option (Rijkenhuizen et al. 2009).In horses, cases have been known to improve on medication, but rarely in horses with intermittent lameness with partial or total occlusion of the femoral artery, surgery is indicated in such cases (Brama et al. 1996; Rijkenhuizen et al. 2009). In human patients, robot-assisted laparoscopically assisted aortofemoral bypasses have been performed with satisfactory results. However, a signi cant learning curve seems to be involved, and no long-term follow-up data are available for review. This would be an interesting approach in horses which have a high post-operative complication rate, whereas already in human patients median operative time was 295 min (range, 180 -475 min) (Novotn /C19yet al. 2011) and the approach to the aorta will be hard. The thrombectomy is used with the goal of debulking the thrombus as far as possible and create recanalisation in order to obtain good blood flow. It might be interesting to combine this with an intra-arterial infusion of Streptokinase (Stelzner and Langhoff 2011) to improve the results. In future, even cell-based therapeutic angiogenesis, already described in human patients, might be an option (Raval and Losordo 2013).

J. M. McFadzean* and E. J. Love School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK The inability to talk does not diminish an animal 's ability to experience pain, although it may hinder its recognition and therefore lead to the under-treatment of pain. Pain assessment and treatment in horses has advanced considerably with the recent publication of numerous research papers in this area. This review will summarise these research ndings and suggest how advances in knowledge of perioperative pain management can be implemented in equine clinical practice. Introduction Unresolved stress or pain behaviour was recently identi ed as one of the four priority welfare challenges facing horses in the UK (Horseman 2017). It is imperative that equine clinicians both assess pain in horses presented for veterinary attention and ensure that pain management protocols are optimised as far as possible for individual horses. The understanding of the physiology of pain has evolved from the concept of a simple re flex arc to one that involves many complex interactions at all levels of the peripheral and central nervous system (Livingston and Chambers 2000). Acute pain usually results from a speci c injury or disease and has a biologic function, whereas chronic pain can be considered as a disease entity in itself (Lamont et al. 2000). In chronic pain, synaptic plasticity of the central nervous system results in increased transmission of pain and a reduction in pain thresholds at the site of original injury and also areas distant to it (Ji et al. 2003). The difference between pain and nociception is relevant when evaluating results of clinical and experimental studies investigating analgesics. Pain is de ned by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as 'An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage '(https://www.iasp-pain. org/Taxonomy). Measuring pain in animals is challenging; so, studies often measure nociceptive responses using electrical, mechanical or thermal stimuli (Moens et al. 2003). Nociceptive threshold testing is a useful technique but does not replicate the complete pain experience that is seen in clinical cases and this disparity can lead to differences in response to a drug in an animal presenting with clinical pain compared with the results from an experimental model. The treatment of pain is dependent upon the recognition of pain. Horses in pain may show '\"low \"and/or \"asymmetrical \"ears, an angled appearance of the eyes, a withdrawn and/or tense stare, mediolaterally dilated nostrils and tension of the lips, chin and certain facial muscles ' (Gleerup et al. 2015) along with changes in behaviour (Price et al. 2003). Generalised behavioural changes occurregardless of the type of pain stimulus, but these are often accompanied by more speci c localising pain behaviours or physiological changes (Gleerup and Lindegaard 2016). An increase in composite pain scale (CPS) and horse grimace scale (HGS) has been seen in ponies following castration (Dalla Costa et al. 2014), with similar results following arthroscopic surgery (Price et al. 2003). An association between CPS score and survival without complication has been found in horses after emergency gastrointestinal surgery (Van Loon et al. 2014). A review on the recognition and quanti cation of pain in horses along with a practical guide to the implementation of pain assessment protocols in horses was recently published in this journal and should be consulted for an in-depth discussion of this topic (Gleerup and Lindegaard 2016). In 2005, only 36.9% of UK equine veterinarians provided analgesia following castration (Price et al. 2005). Hopefully, with increasing awareness of equine pain behaviours and more data regarding the use of analgesics in horses, this under-treatment will have improved. The reluctance to use analgesics is not limited to the UK. In New Zealand, 55% of veterinarians have morphine available for the treatment of horses, but only 13% use it (Waran et al. 2010). In an international survey of veterinarians who perform equine anaesthesia, 81.2% of respondents 'or'not at all '(Wohlfender et al. 2015). The tendency towards older analgesics is also highlighted with 69% of equine veterinarians using Phenylbutazone or Flunixin either 'as standard 'or'frequently '(Wohlfender et al. with of UK equine veterinary surgeons prescribing phenylbutazone or flunixin. This is in contrast to small animal practice where there is a move towards more recently licensed treatments (Hunt et al. 2015). An effective perioperative analgesic plan starts before the procedure and should be appropriate to the diagnosis, planned surgery and duration of expected post-operative discomfort. Pre-emptive analgesia will result in clinically effective drug concentrations before surgery begins. An understanding of drug pharmacology and pain pathways is essential and assists with the formulation of an individualised multimodal drug protocol which targets the pain pathways at multiple levels (Muir 2010). The theory behind the use of a multi-modal technique is that lower doses of individual drugs can be used by taking advantage of additive and synergistic effects that certain drugs show when given together with a consequent reduction in side effects (Lamont 2008). In horses, locoregional anaesthesia plays an important role and should be used with systemic analgesia whenever possible in multi-modal analgesic protocols. The World Health Organization rst introduced the idea of 'pain ladders 'in the context of cancer pain in adult human \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd374 10.1111/eve.12880patients (WHO, 2017). The idea behind the pain ladder is that increasing pain severity is matched with an increase in the analgesic potency or interventional nature of the route of administration. With minimal adjustment, the pain ladder formula can provide a good framework for designing a perioperative analgesic plan in equine practice. The horse is classi ed as a food-producing animal within the EU, and therefore medicines mentioned in this article should be prescribed in accordance with BEVA guidelines (www.beva.org.uk). Medicines prescribed for competition horses should be checked against the Equine Prohibited Substance List (https://inside.fei.org/fei/cleansport/ad-h/ prohibited-list). Commonly used analgesic drug doses are listed in Table 1 . Systemic the mainstay of analgesia in horses and, unless there is a contraindication to their administration, they should be included in the analgesic protocols of horses undergoing surgery. The variety of formulations and their long duration of action make them an attractive choice, with phenylbutazone and flunixin the most commonly used drugs (Price et al. 2002; Wohlfender et al. 2015). Pre-emptive administration of NSAIDs may help to reduce the likelihood of development of central sensitisation as has been shown with opioid and NSAID administration in other species (Lascelles et al. 1997, 1998) and timing their administration so that they are given before surgery means that they will be having an analgesic effect when the effects of anaesthesia are waning. Clinical experience and familiarity form the basis of NSAID selection in clinical practice; clinicians often express a preference for the use of phenylbutazone in horses with orthopaedic pain and flunixin for horses with visceral pain, although this is not supported by evidence (Johnson et al. 1993). Nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs act by inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1 and -2) enzymes, resulting in a reduction in the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane. COX-2 selectivity was thought to COX-1 a constitutive enzyme requiredfor coagulation, protection of gastric mucosa and maintenance of renal blood flow. It is now known that COX-2 is also a constitutive enzyme in the eye, central nervous system and kidney, with COX-2 required for the healing of gastric ulcers. Potential adverse effects reported for NSAID use at therapeutic doses in the horse include gastric ulceration, renal dysfunction and right dorsal colitis (Andrews and McConnico 2009). Meloxicam is a COX-2-selective NSAID that is licensed for the treatment of acute and chronic musculoskeletal disorders and colic. Evidence suggests a bene cial effect on healing of the intestinal mucosa following ischaemic injury when meloxicam is used compared with flunixin (Little et al. 2007). When meloxicam was compared with flunixin for provision of post-operative analgesia following surgery for strangulated small intestine, horses that received flunixin had signi cantly lower pain scores than those that received meloxicam (Naylor et al. 2014). Firocoxib is licensed for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis, and vedaprofen for the treatment of post-operative pain. The reduction in lameness score after treatment with rocoxib is similar to both phenylbutazone and vedaprofen, with the only treatment-related side effects being swelling of the lips and tongue and likely related to the paste formulation of the rocoxib and vedaprofen (Doucet et al. 2008; Koene et al. 2010). The use of topical NSAID creams and gels is reported clinically, with a cream containing 1% diclofenac sodium available in North America. Five-day treatment with diclofenac applied twice daily over an affected joint causing lameness was found to cause a signi cant reduction in pain and lameness score (Lynn et al. 2004) Opioids Opioids, particularly butorphanol, are often included in sedation protocols although perioperative use of opioids is still limited in equine practice (Wohlfender et al. 2015). This may be related to apprehension over possible side effects, with the potential for excitability following i.v. injection and decreased intestinal motility following general anaesthesia being commonly stated concerns (Clutton 2010). The optimal dose of systemically administered morphine for analgesia in clinical cases has not yet been established.

(2011) \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd375 EQUINE EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019The early dose -response studies investigated relatively high doses of morphine in small numbers of pain-free, healthy horses using experimental threshold testing assays rather than clinical pain (Kalpravidh et al. 1984b; Roger et al. 1985). Morphine may have some bene ts when administered to horses under anaesthesia; horses that received a morphine bolus followed by a continuous rate infusion (CRI) during halothane anaesthesia had similar haemodynamic variables to those that did not (Clark et al. 2005) and the administration of morphine was also associated with the need for less additional anaesthetic agent, fewer attempts to stand and shorter times to standing (Clark et al. 2005, 2008; Love et al. 2006). In horses undergoing airway surgery, 0.2 mg/kg bwt had no additional bene ts over 0.1 mg/kg bwt on the duration or quality of recovery following anaesthesia although the surgery performed was relatively noninvasive (compared with orthopaedic surgery) and post- operative pain was not assessed (Love et al. 2006). Con flicting results on the association of post-anaesthetic colic and the use of morphine may make clinical decision-making dif cult. In one retrospective study, the use of morphine was associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of colic following orthopaedic surgery (Senior et al. 2004), although another retrospective study found no increased incidence of post-anaesthetic colic in horses that received morphine compared with those that did not (Andersen et al. 2006). It is likely that the aetiology of post-anaesthetic colic is multifactorial rather than simply attributable to morphine alone. Morphine is associated with an increase in locomotor activity in healthy pain-free horses (Carregaro et al. 2007). This increase in locomotor activity is less likely to be seen in horses having surgery or those that are already experiencing pain (Muir 1981; Mircica et al. 2003), with horses that received 0.1 mg/kg bwt morphine for sedation for standing surgery showing no intraoperative ataxia or locomotor activity (Potter et al. 2016). The con flicting arguments presented above highlight the different ndings that may be seen in experimental and clinical studies and explain why the use of systemic morphine in horses is controversial. More data are available to support the use of morphine by the epidural or intra-articular routes in horses. Buprenorphine has a marketing authorisation in the UK for post-operative analgesia in horses. It produces a longer duration of antinociception to thermal stimuli than butorphanol (Love et al. 2012). These experimental ndings were con rmed in a clinical study where buprenorphine provided more effective post-operative analgesia than butorphanol after elective surgical procedures performed under general anaesthesia without detrimental effects (Taylor et al. 2016). The use of buprenorphine in combination with a detomidine CRI and local anaesthetic blocks for standing surgery resulted in more complications in the post-operative period than the use of morphine (Potter et al. 2016). All horses that received buprenorphine, box-walked and had muscle tremors or shivered and half of the horses were hypersensitive to noise. No horses that received morphine showed complications, although only a small sample size of four horses per group was used. This increased incidence of side effects in the buprenorphine group may be due to detomidine in fluencing the excretion of the concurrently administered buprenorphine resulting in a higher plasma concentration than that achieved when buprenorphine isgiven alone (Pakkanen et al. 2015). To investigate this hypothesis, plasma samples would have needed to be taken for buprenorphine concentration determination. In addition, local anaesthetic blocks were used as part of the analgesic protocol -if these were effective, the requirements for buprenorphine would have been reduced. Sublingual use of buprenorphine has been reported in a 5-month-old Thoroughbred lly with a cervical vertebral fracture (Walker 2007). A dose of 0.006 mg/kg bwt was given twice daily with onset of analgesia and sedation subjectively assessed to occur 45 min after administration into the interdental space. Mucosal absorption of buprenorphine following sublingual administration may provide a practically easy method of providing longer duration post-operative analgesia. Butorphanol is the most commonly used opioid in equine practice (Wohlfender et al. 2015). In nociceptive studies of visceral and super cial pain 0.2 mg/kg bwt was suggested as the optimal dose (Kalpravidh et al. 1984a) although this is considerably higher than the doses listed on the datasheet in the UK for sedation and analgesia. The duration of analgesia for visceral pain was 4 h after 0.22 mg/kg bwt, compared with 1 bwt morphine (Kalpravidh et al. 1984b). Despite this, no improvement in recovery quality or a reduction in inhalational requirement has been seen during anaesthesia (Bettschart-Wolfensberger et al. 2011; Dias et al. 2014). A post-operative CRI of butorphanol at 13 lg/kg/h was associated with lower plasma cortisol concentrations, improved behaviour scores and less bodyweight loss (Sellon et al. 2004) [Correction added on 24 Jan 2018, after rst online publication: The units for butorphanol were incorrect and are updated in this version]. This nding is consistent with the horses that received a butorphanol CRI post-operatively experiencing less pain. It has been demonstrated to be an ineffective sole analgesic following castration (Love et al. 2009). Methadone has a UK marketing authorisation for use in cats and dogs. A dose of 0.2 mg/kg bwt has been demonstrated to have an antinociceptive effect to mechanical, thermal and electrical stimulus when administered in combination with acepromazine or detomidine to horses, with the combination of methadone and detomidine having the greatest effect (Lopes et al. 2016). In a lipopolysaccharide-induced synovitis model, methadone was found to produce analgesia with less reduction in gastrointestinal sounds than morphine (Carregaro et al. 2014). If this nding is found to be consistent in clinical cases, this may alleviate some of the concerns of post- operative ileus after morphine. Studies on the analgesic effect of methadone on animals experiencing clinical pain are currently limited. Transdermal fentanyl patches have been used to treat horses with pain nonresponsive to NSAID treatment; application of either one or two 10 mg fentanyl patches to the antebrachium was found to reduce pain but not lameness scores. Uptake of drug varies between sites of application; the thorax or groin results in greater systemic absorption with shorter lag time than the limb (Mills and Cross 2007). The method used to prepare the area for transdermal drug administration in fluences the systemic absorption as does variation in skin thickness between sites (Mills et al. 2004; Mills and Cross 2006). The time taken to reach analgesic serum concentrations varies from 1 to 14 h (Maxwell et al. 2003; Thomasy et al. 2004), and in one study, plasma \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd376 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019concentrations of fentanyl failed to reach analgesic levels in 33% of horses (Orsini et al. 2006). Transdermal fentanyl patches were found to be easy to apply and well tolerated in foals, but similar to adults, systemic absorption was variable with no assessment of analgesic provision (Eberspacher et al. 2008). Based on the studies, when placing a transdermal fentanyl patch, the skin should be clipped and prepared with alcohol and chlorhexidine solution (Mills and Cross 2006). This approach may differ between human subjects and other species as the relatively clean, hair-free and consistent dermal thickness make transposition of human ndings hard. The most appropriate site to apply the patch is the thorax. Due to impracticalities of keeping the patch in position, use of a limb is better suited for keeping the patch in contact with the skin. The variable lag time and systemic absorption means that the use of transdermal fentanyl patches requires close attention to the monitoring of pain scores, but may be useful for long-lasting analgesia of outpatients post-operatively. In summary, there is evidence that perioperative administration of opioids reduces post-operative pain in horses and they should be included in multi-modal analgesic protocols. Further research is required to determine the effects of longer term administration on gastrointestinal function and repeated dosing of morphine, or buprenorphine in the post-operative period should be based on the assessment of an individual horse whereby the risk of ileus is balanced against the welfare of the animal. Lidocaine Lidocaine is often used systemically for its prokinetic properties in horses with colic. In horses undergoing castration under general anaesthesia, i.v. lidocaine had analgesic properties (Murrell et al. 2005), and during various surgeries in horses, there was a reduction in inhalational agent requirements when lidocaine was administered i.v. (Schuhbeck et al. 2012). In conscious horses, administration of i.v. lidocaine produced antinociception to a thermal stimulus but not to colorectal distention, suggesting a possible role in managing somatic pain (Robertson et al. 2005). The potential for adverse effects should be considered when lidocaine is used systemically. Neurological signs of toxicity include rapid blinking, anxiety, visual disturbance and ataxia and may be seen at doses of 30 lg/kg/min (Meyer et al. 2001). Horses that had a 1.5 mg/kg bwt loading bolus developed clinical signs earlier than those horses that did not, with cardiovascular signs of toxicity not apparent at doses causing neurological signs. A bolus of lidocaine is often given before commencing the CRI although this may not be required as no inhalant-sparing effect or difference in cardiopulmonary parameters and recovery scores was found between horses that did or did not receive a loading bolus under iso flurane anaesthesia (Nannarone et al. 2015). Not giving a loading bolus may reduce the potential for reaching a toxic threshold. The systemic dose needed to produce toxic side effects may be reduced in compromised cases due to a slower hepatic clearance of the drug. General anaesthesia may mask the signs of neurological toxicity making recognition harder. Intraoperative administration of lidocaine may have a negative impact on quality of recovery from general anaesthesia (Valverde et al. 2005; Schuhbeck et al. 2012); so, it is recommended that the lidocaine CRI should be stoppedat least 30 min before transfer to the recovery box and also that additional sedation in recovery may be required (Valverde et al. 2005). One study supports the therapeutic role of lidocaine in horses with ileus by reduction in re flux and shorter length of hospitalisation (Malone et al. 2006); however, a more recent study found no effect of lidocaine administration on total reflux volume or duration, or on post-operative survival (Salem et al. 2016). Equivocal results on its use for analgesia and reduction in post-operative ileus mean that lidocaine should not be relied upon to provide post-operative analgesia and other analgesics should be administered concurrently. Ketamine Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative and is the most commonly used agent for the induction of general anaesthesia in horses (Wohlfender et al. 2015). Sub- anaesthetic doses produce analgesia by interacting with NMDA receptors. In chronic pain states, NMDA receptor antagonism limits the development of central sensitisation by inhibiting temporal summation and secondary mechanical hyperalgesia (Woolf 2011). Ketamine is commonly presented as a racemic mixture of the R( /C0) and S( +) enantiomers, although enantiopure preparations containing the S( +) isomer are available. S( +)-ketamine is twice as potent as the racemic mixture and is associated with faster recovery times. These possible bene ts have led to preliminary investigations into its use in the horse (Larenza et al. 2009; Canola et al. 2015; Casoni et al. 2015) although this preparation does not have a veterinary Marketing Authorisation. In healthy cases, after administration of ketamine, direct stimulation of the central nervous system leads to increased sympathetic tone and subsequent increases in blood pressure and heart rate. In sick cases, the direct depressant effects of ketamine on the myocardium may become apparent due to depletion of catecholamine stores within the sympathetic system. A MAC-sparing effect of 37% was found under halothane anaesthesia when ketamine was given by CRI; this combination of ketamine administration and reduced inhalation agent resulted in an increased cardiac output (Muir and Sams 1992). Administration of a low-dose ketamine infusion (20 mcg/kg/min) in conscious experimental horses reduced the response to electrical cutaneous stimulation (Peterbauer et al. 2008). In horses with naturally occurring laminitis that received 0.6 mg/kg/h ketamine for 6 h once daily for 3 days, alongside tramadol twice daily, increased forelimb loading was found both during and after treatment and this was attributed to ketamine 's effect on reducing central sensitisation (Guedes et al. 2012). The same laminitic horses also had lower concentrations of circulating inflammatory prostaglandins TNF- aand thromboxane B(2) suggesting an anti-in clinical experience suggests that a low-dose ketamine CRI may have some bene t in cases that involve orthopaedic and somatic pain that is not responding to conventional treatment with opioids and NSAIDs, although it may be of less use in visceral pain (Matthews et al. 2004). Ketamine should not be relied on as a sole analgesic agent although it should be considered in horses experiencing neuropathic pain due to conditions such as laminitis and as an analgesic adjunct in horses with pain that is proving dif cult to control. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd377 the locus coeruleus in the brain and analgesic effects via actions on supra- and spinal tissues (Murrell and Hellebrekers 2005). The antinociceptive properties of the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists have been demonstrated using both visceral and mechanical pain models (Muir and Robertson 1985; Moens et al. 2003). However, in clinical cases, their sedative effects can confound the interpretation of their analgesic effects, particularly as the sedative effects outlast the analgesic properties (Chambers et al. 1993). Increased alpha-2 adrenoreceptor selectivity should theoretically lead to increased analgesic ef cacy, especially as alpha-1 adrenoreceptor agonist activity has been found to interfere with alpha-2 adrenoreceptor-mediated analgesia (Gil et al. 2009). al. 1989; Sinclair 2003). Other mechanisms of analgesia may play a role as the in vivo analgesia does not precisely follow the increasing alpha-2 adrenoreceptor selectivity, with detomidine providing better analgesia than romi dine against electrical stimulation of cutaneous regions (Moens et al. 2003). This nding may not translate precisely to clinical manifestation of pain (Hamm et al. 1995; Moens et al. 2003). Constant rate infusions of alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists are commonly used for sedation in standing horses and to supplement inhalant anaesthetic techniques (partial i.v. anaesthesia). Following an initial loading dose, the aim is to administer the drug by infusion to achieve stable plasma drug concentrations. This should avoid peaks and troughs in analgesia or sedation and potentially lead to fewer side effects. The pharmacokinetic pro le of (dex-) medetomidine makes it a good choice for intraoperative CRI (Bettschart- Wolfensberger et al. 1999). A signi cant reduction in isoflurane requirement is seen with medetomidine CRI (Neges et al. 2003), and dexmedetomidine is associated with improved recovery scores with only limited cardiopulmonary effects (Marcilla et al. 2012). The use of a CRI of an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist results in a subjectively more stable plane of anaesthesia and less requirement for additional anaesthetic top-ups (Neges et al. 2003) although it is not clear whether this is a result of their antinociceptive effects or as a consequence of MAC reduction. Dexmedetomidine or medetomidine do not have a marketing authorisation for administration to horses making their routine use dif cult to justify. Romi dine and detomidine are licensed alternatives and also have an iso flurane-sparing effect (Niimura Del Barrio et al. 2017). Although the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists lead to a reduction in intestinal motility, the precise effect of an intraoperative CRI on post-operative gastrointestinal function is not clear and their effects on post-operative analgesia requirements have not yet been established. Their use may contribute to a multimodal protocol although they should not be relied upon as a sole analgesic. The sedative effects of the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists often preclude their use for post-operative and longer term analgesia. Other systemic analgesics The use of gabapentin is documented in case reports for the treatment of neuropathic pain unresponsive to other treatments (Davis et al. 2007), and management of severehoof pain in combination with other systemic analgesics (Dutton et al. 2009). Tramadol co-administered with a low dose of ketamine was successfully used as part of an analgesic protocol in a horse with pain due to laminitis (Guedes et al. 2012). Tramadol 5 mg/kg bwt orally every 12 h for one week gave limited analgesia for 3 days only. The addition of a ketamine infusion at 0.6 mg/kg/h, for 6 h on the rst 3 days of treatment, signi cantly increased the level and duration of analgesia. An experimental study reported a lack of antinociceptive effects against thermal, electrical or pinprick stimulation following administration of tramadol at 2 mg/kg bwt i.v. (Dhanjal et al. 2009; Seo et al. 2011) although the duration of antinociception following xylazine administration was extended by the concurrent use of tramadol (Seo et al. 2011) suggesting that it may play a useful role as part of a multimodal analgesic protocol. The use of paracetamol as an adjunct treatment for laminitis has also been described in a pony (West et al. 2011). Further research is needed before routine use of these drugs can be recommended although their use can be considered on an individual case basis. Locoregional techniques Local anaesthesia The use of local anaesthetics for the diagnosis of lameness in horses is commonplace; the same techniques and drugs can also be used for the provision of effective perioperative analgesia. The versatility of this class of drug means that it can be used in multiple different ways, with a technique available for most situations. Local anaesthetics stop the transmission of the pain signal by binding to and blocking Na+channels when they are in the open or inactivated state; for this reason, nerves of high ring frequency are most likely to be blocked. One limitation of the local anaesthetics is their reduced performance in infected tissues, this is due to the altered pH of the tissue affecting the fraction of unionised drug (Ueno et al. 2008). In this instance, a nerve block at a site remote from the infected tissue may be of bene t. The use of nerve blocks to facilitate dental and ophthalmic procedures in the standing and anaesthetised horse has been well described. The inferior alveolar (mandibular) block will desensitise the mandible and lower dental arcade (Harding et al. 2012) and the maxillary block desensitises most structures of the maxilla including the rostral maxilla, paranasal sinuses and upper dental arcade (Bardell et al. 2010). Accidental blockade of the lingual nerve has been reported to occur with blockade of the mandibular nerve resulting in self trauma of the tongue (Caldwell and Easley 2012). This is probably an increased risk when bilateral mandibular nerve blocks are performed. When performing nerve blocks of the horse 's eye it should be remembered that the auriculopalpebral/palpebral nerve supplies only motor function and, although a block of this nerve will aid in examination of the eye, it does not desensitise any structures. Blockade of the frontal, lacrimal, zygomatic and infratrochlear nerves will desensitise the periorbital region. A retrobulbar block will facilitate enucleation, but may need to be accompanied by an auriculopalpebral block for immobilising the upper eyelid. Inltration of local anaesthetic into the testicle, cord and subcutaneously before castration in standing, sedated horses is routine; this technique is also useful in anaesthetised horses \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd378 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019and may reduce the incidence of movement as well as requirement for supplemental doses of anaesthetics (Portier et al. 2009). Subcutaneous in ltration of local anaesthetic is easy to perform before wound closure. Increasingly, orthopaedic surgery is being performed in standing, sedated horses and nerve blocks can improve surgical conditions and reduce the requirements for additional chemical restraint. In standing, sedated horses distal limb blocks should be performed before arthroscopy or fracture repair, with speci c nerve blocks often being used alongside a ring block (Payne and Compston 2012). Intravenous regional techniques for delivery of antimicrobials is commonly implemented in equine practice and the same technique can be used to desensitise the distal limbs. Desensitisation of the limb being operated on with local anaesthesia can also be considered in horses having the procedures done under general anaesthesia although careful thought should be given to the individual case as ataxia and effects on control of the limb are potential hazards during recovery from anaesthesia. Intra-articular injection following arthroscopic procedures can contribute analgesia for in flamed joints (Van Loon et al. 2010). Caution must be used as systemic uptake of the drugs still occurs and systemic side effects can still be seen (Di Salvo et al. 2014). Concern over chondrotoxicity of the local anaesthetics has been a topic of discussion in recent years. In an in vitro cell culture preparation of equine chondrocytes mepivacaine was the least chondrotoxic, with bupivacaine showing the most chondrotoxicity to equine cartilage (Park et al. 2011). However, in vivo effects do not always mimic the changes seen in laboratory cell culture preparations and the method of delivery of the local anaesthetic probably has a signi cant impact on the effects of local anaesthetics on chondrocytes since in human subjects continuous infusion of local anaesthetic into the joint has a more deleterious effect than would be expected from a drug effect alone (Dragoo et al. 2008). A single injection of a low concentration of local anaesthetic would appear to be safe, whereas the effects of a continuous infusions require further investigation (Webb and Ghosh 2009). When morphine (0.05 mg/kg) is given intra-articularly, to horses with lipopolysaccharide-induced synovitis, it is detectable within the synovial fluid for 24 h and results in less swelling and lameness than the same dose of morphine given i.v. (Lindegaard et al. 2010a,b,c). The reduced swelling of the joint when morphine was given intra-articularly supports morphine having a peripheral anti-in flammatory effect as well as a central mechanism of action. Despite a reduction in lameness there was no difference in pain score between the two routes of administration (Lindegaard et al. 2010c). Paravertebral thoracolumbar anaesthesia in horses having standing laparoscopic procedures produces good to excellent anaesthesia in 80% of cases (Moon and subarachnoid anaesthesia and analgesia Epidural anaesthesia was rst described in the horse almost 100 years ago (Pape and Pitzschk 1925). Use of both a single injection and repeated dosing via an epidural catheter are options for both anaesthetics, opioids and be administered via the epidural space,although it must be remembered that systemic uptake of the drugs will occur and side effects may become apparent, for example, sedation and ataxia. Epidural injections are most commonly performed via the rst intercoccygeal space, with location of the space most practically identi ed by repeatedly raising and lowering the tail. Subarachnoid injection, where the drug is injected into the cerebrospinal fluid rather than the epidural space, can be performed at the lumbar-sacral (L7-S1) space, although this technique is more challenging and often resented by the horses (Natalini and Driessen 2007) which limits its use clinically. Opioids, most commonly morphine, are used for epidural analgesia. Opioid receptors are found extensively in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and opioid agonists can provide effective and long-lasting pain relief (Cousins and Mather 1984; Valverde et al. 1990). Analgesia can be achieved as far cranially as the thoracic dermatomes after a single epidural injection of morphine diluted to a volume of 20 mL (Natalini and Robinson 2000). Another potential bene t is that morphine administered into the epidural space has also been found to inhibit the development of hyperalgesia in an experimental model of synovitis (Van Loon et al. 2012). Concern over side effects is similar when administering opioids in the epidural space as when they are given systemically although the dose administered epidurally is usually lower than that given systemically which should reduce the risk or intensity of side effects. In healthy horses morphine reduced gastrointestinal transit times but not when used for provision of analgesia for laparoscopic castration (Sano et al. 2011; Martin-Flores et al. 2014) indicating differences in effects between healthy and painful horses. Both methadone and buprenorphine also provide effective analgesia when given epidurally. Methadone provides effective analgesia but with a shorter duration than that reported for morphine (Olbrich and Mosing 2003). In horses undergoing bilateral sti fle arthroscopy, epidural buprenorphine plus detomidine produced analgesia of similar intensity and duration to that provided by morphine and detomidine (Fischer et al. 2009). Combining a local anaesthetic with an opioid extends the duration of analgesia compared with the use of an opioid alone (Hendrix et al. 1996). However, care should be taken with the volume of local anaesthetic used as cranial spread can impair the function of the pelvic limbs and cause ataxia or even paralysis. If an epidural including a local anaesthetic is to be administered consider restraining the horse in stocks and ensure that everyone working with the horse is aware that ataxia is a potential risk. The total volume used will depend on the size and conformation of the horse and the drug or combination of drugs used. Less than 10 mL total volume should be used in adult horses if a combination including a local anaesthetic is used, as cranial spread of volumes greater than this may cause hindlimb paralysis and recumbency of the cases (Natalini and Driessen 2007). Alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists administered epidurally can increase both the sensory and motor blockade compared with an opioid or local anaesthetic used alone. Speed of onset is quicker and an extended duration of action is also seen (Grubb et al. 1992). Doses of other drugs given at the same time should be reduced. Systemic uptake of the drug also occurs and signs of sedation, ataxia and cardiovascular changes such as bradycardia and atrioventricular block may become apparent. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd379 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019Adjunctive therapies When devising a perioperative analgesia plan, the use of nondrug therapy should also be considered. Good nursing care is imperative and, in addition, the use of cold packs on inflamed tissues and physiotherapy when appropriate will also help. Although acupuncture is frequently employed by equine veterinarians in the treatment of chronic pain (Bergenstrahle and Nielsen 2016) its ef cacy for treatment of acute pain and in the perioperative period is unknown. Its use for the treatment of colic pain has been shown to be less effective than butorphanol in one method (Skarda and Muir 2003) and ineffective in another (Merritt et al. 2002). Application Table 2 suggests when each therapy should be used. The basis of any plan should be the use of NSAIDs, with the addition of partial and then full opioid agonists as the severity of pain increases. Dosing intervals for opioids in acute surgical pain should also be determined by the severity of the pain shown and not by set timing intervals. The addition of a locoregional technique prior to surgery should always be used if appropriate. This basic plan of NSAID plus opioid and locoregional technique is suf cient in most elective surgery cases and addition of further drugs is rarely required. Only when pain persists despite this, or comorbidities mean this plan cannot be implemented, are other options considered. In the hospital setting, use of an infusion seems the most obvious choice to add next. Lidocaine will be familiar to many for its use after colic surgery and may make this an attractive choice, despite unfamiliarity with ketamine as an analgesic it could also be considered at this point. The risk of sedation and the dif culty with the differentiation of sedation and analgesia may limit the use of alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists. The ease of use of a fentanyl patch makes this an attractive option but its individual variability may make this an unreliable option. The choice of which drug to choose is also limited by cost, familiarity and practicality.Conclusion The ability to recognise pain behaviours in horses is an essential skill of the equine veterinarian. The publication of clinically useful pain scales for this species will further aid in the recognition of pain in the perioperative period. Careful consideration should be given to the mechanism of the pain stimulus when planning a surgery and an analgesic plan. The use of multimodal analgesia, using drugs from different classes, and given both systemically and locoregionally, will improve outcomes and the welfare of horses.

W. van Eps* Department of Clinical Studies, New Bolton Center, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, USA The inability to control pain is the most common reason for cessation of treatment and euthanasia in cases of laminitis, yet pain also serves a unique protective function in these cases, particularly in the acute phase when lamellar integrity is weakened. Successful analgesia requires an understanding of the disease pathophysiology, the sources of pain in laminitis, methods of serial pain evaluation, and methods of analgesia including systemic and regional techniques. This review discusses the approach to analgesia including detail of traditional and novel analgesic medications and techniques with speci c reference to the laminitis case. Introduction The inability to control pain is arguably the most important factor contributing to treatment failure and euthanasia in horses suffering from laminitis. A multimodal analgesic approach may be required, and this can be formulated based on knowledge of the different sources and pathways of pain in laminitis. Such a multimodal approach, particularly with the inclusion of regional techniques, can also help to minimise side effects associated with the use of systemic pharmaceutical agents. Sensory innervation of the foot The equine foot is innervated by the medial and lateral digital nerves and dorsal branches of the palmar/plantar nerves (Sack 1975). A recent study has con rmed that the palmar digital nerves innervate the lamellar corium in the forelimb, whereas the dorsal branches of the palmar digital nerves innervate the coronary band (Paz et al. 2016). Nociceptors are specialised sensory neurons in tissues which are activated speci cally by noxious (mechanical, chemical or thermal) stimuli. The A dand C sensory nerve bres are primarily responsible for nociceptive transmission associated with these noxious stimuli that are registered by free nerve endings in the dermis of the lamellae, sole and coronary band (Bowker et al. 1993). Central to the conversion of the noxious stimuli into electrical signals at the nociceptor are transient receptor potential (TRP) channels present at the nerve endings (Julius 2013). The A band A anerve bres transmit information from mechanoreceptors (Pacinian corpuscles and Merkel cells) located in various regions of the foot, including the heels, frog and lamellae (Bowker et al. 2017). Sensory innervation of the distal phalanx is via branches of the digital nerves entering the solear foramina and also near the insertion of the deep flexor tendon (Sack 1975). Despite the potentially important contribution of nociceptive signals registered and transmitted by nervereceptors and bres within the distal phalanx itself to laminitis (Engiles 2010), sensory innervation of the distal phalanx has not been studied in detail. Afferent nerve bres transmit the signals from the foot via the digital nerves to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. At the spinal cord level, the passage of pain information (spinal nociception) from peripheral to central areas is controlled and modulated and further transferred to higher centres and the brain (Urban and Gebhart 1999). Here, the thalamus is the key area for processing somatosensory information (supraspinal nociception) and the perception of pain as well as the interaction with other areas of the brain, for example, the cerebellum and basal ganglia (Apkarian et al. 2005). Descending pain pathways suppress pain, with noradrenaline and serotonin the key neurotransmitters. The origins of pain in laminitis The precise sources of foot pain in laminitis vary with the stage of the disease process as well as the inciting cause. Processes and pathways that may contribute to pain in laminitis are summarised in Figure 1 , and include inflammation, increased tissue pressure, tearing and contusion of soft tissues, ischaemia, altered/excessive contact between the sole and the distal phalanx, bone pathology and neuropathic mechanisms (Jones et al. 2007; Collins et al. 2010; Driessen et al. 2010; Engiles 2010). Intense in flammation within the lamellae is well documented early in models of acute sepsis-associated laminitis (Belknap et al. 2007) and may account for the relatively severe and sudden onset of foot pain (preceding any perceivable displacement of the distal phalanx) that is typical of laminitis development in this clinical scenario. In contrast, the insidious clinical onset of endocrinopathic laminitis may be, in part, explained by the relative lack of lamellar in flammation (at least early) in this form of the disease (Visser and Pollitt 2011). There is a component of ongoing in flammation within both the lamellae and adjacent distal phalanx in chronic laminitis regardless of the inciting cause (Engiles et al. 2015). Lamellar ischaemia may be an important initiator of supporting limb laminitis and may contribute to the progression of other forms of laminitis (van Eps et al. 2010; Gardner et al. 2017). Ischaemia causes pain through local tissue lactic acidosis and release of chemical mediators including serotonin, bradykinin, histamine, reactive oxygen species and adenosine (Benson et al. 1999; Fu and Longhurst 2005). Once the suspensory function of the lamellae is compromised, secondary tissue injury including tearing and contusion of soft-tissue structures of the lamellar and solear corium will contribute to pain. In particular, crushing of the sensitive solear corium by the (now improperly suspended) nerve-like structures (Serre etal. 1999) and itfollows that the oflaminitis, marked byosteolysis/remodelling, oedema and inflammation (Engiles etal. 2015), may directly contribute Ifpain signalling isaltered, apathologic pain can occur, which leads toaperception ofpain that isinappropriately great compared with the actual noxious stimulus (hyperalgesia) (Costigan etal.2009). Neuropathic pain can result from disturbances ineither the peripheral orthe central nervous system. While peripheral changes usually lead tospontaneous activity and can cause temporal summation (addition ofmultiple nociceptive stimuli over ashort-time period), central ascentral sensitisation lead toprolonged response times inthe dorsal horn viaN-methyl-d-aspartate and Mannion The result ofallofthese changes isthat the sensory threshold forpain signalling is lowered and there isspread ofthe receptive eld. Ithas been demonstrated that the morphological and molecular changes typical ofneuropathic pain states can befound inthe digital nerves (nerve bres within the feet and the cell bodies within thedorsal ganglia ofthespine) and thismust beconsidered pain account may serve aunique protective function inhorses with laminitis and the importance ofthis factor varies with the stage ofthe disease. Itisessential that analgesia isadequate toensure the comfort and welfare ofthe patient, but this must be balanced and complimented simultaneously byappropriate con nement and restriction ofambulatory activity. Acute episodes ambulation isminimised horse recovering from acute laminitis inparticular, thecombination ofanalgesia and premature paddock turnout typically will toexacerbation ofthe lamellar injury and protracted convalescence due tosecondary damage.

From the authors 'experience, at a minimum a week of con nement for every day of acute lameness is a good general recommendation for a horse or pony recovering from an acute laminitis bout. The concept of multimodal analgesia involves the use of different types of analgesic drugs that act by different mechanisms at different sites of the nervous system to provide superior analgesia with fewer side effects. The use of multimodal analgesia is often reserved for laminitis cases that do not respond to conventional therapy; however, the suspected contribution of spinal 'wind-up 'in acute laminitis cases and the documented neuropathic component to the chronic laminitis pain state (Jones et al. 2007) are reasons to consider an early multimodal analgesic approach in every case. In the severe acute laminitis case, for example, a combination of centrally acting medications, such as lidocaine, ketamine, opioids and alpha-2 agonists, can be administered together as an infusion for the short-term treatment of severe acute pain (Abrahamsen 2005). In less severe acute laminitis (or the chronic case with an acute component), the addition of individual centrally acting analgesic agents, such as lidocaine, ketamine or gabapentin, and/or regional techniques, such as cooling, epidural therapy (opioids and alpha-2 agonists) or regional nerve blockade, should still be considered in order to provide superior analgesia compared with NSAIDs alone and to help prevent the development of neuropathic pain. In chronic cases, the addition of oral gabapentin to an NSAID regimen may be a practical means of targeting the neuropathic pain component in the longer term. Using these multimodal combinations may lead to a reduction in NSAID dose requirements in individual cases at different stages of the disease, reducing the risk of NSAID-related side effects. Besides pharmacological treatment options, there are a number of other important considerations when addressing pain in the laminitis case. Provision of a soft and deformable ground surface that supports the sole and frog (e.g. sand) can markedly improve lameness in many acute and chronic cases. Careful evaluation of the feet using hoof testers can help to identify speci cally painful regions of the sole that may be associated with either bruising (often due to displacement of the distal phalanx) or the formation of a solear abscess: both common complications of chronic laminitis. Appropriate drainage of solear abscesses, as well as the use of trimming, shoeing or orthotic manipulations aimed at redistributing load off painful regions of the sole are critical measures in affected cases. There may be a considerable component of pain in some chronic laminitis cases associated with distopalmar/distoplantar rotation or displacement of the dorsodistal aspect of the distal phalanx and the resultant compression between the tip of the bone, the sole and the ground surface. Evaluation of the feet in these cases will reveal convexity, prolapse and sometimes perforation of the sole in this region with a marked focal response to hoof testing. If orthotic or shoeing intervention fails to control pain associated with this, surgical intervention to reduce traction of the deep flexor tendon via tenotomy may be bene cial (Eastman et al. 1999). In many of these cases, there is also marked osteolysis and in flammation of the bone that may also itself contribute to pain (Engiles et al. 2015). Interestingly, the refractory neuropathic pain of complex regional pain syndrome in human patients isresponsive to therapy aimed at inhibiting similar osteoclastic bone resorption using bisphosphonates (Wang et al. 2016; Chevreau et al. 2017). An important aspect of the analgesic management for cases undergoing procedures that could temporarily worsen foot pain is the concept of pre-emptive analgesia. Pre- emptive analgesia prevents establishment of altered processing of afferent input which can amplify post-operative pain and is a well-established strategy for minimising post- operative pain in human patients (Russo et al. 2017). In horses with laminitis, pre-emptive regional (nerve block or epidural therapy) and/or systemic analgesic treatment should be considered before surgical or farriery interventions that are likely to temporarily worsen pain despite providing longer term bene t. Pain monitoring Laminitis-related pain has an important impact on equine welfare, and the complexity of the laminitic pain pro le necessitates thorough and repeated pain assessment as a basis for successful pain therapy. The assessment of pain should be as objective and sensitive as possible so that the effectiveness of the analgesic regimen can be reliably assessed. Lameness evaluation remains the primary means of evaluating laminitis pain along with regular assessment of vital parameters such as heart rate and respiratory rate. The physiological stress response and the behavioural signs of severe and acute pain are well described in horses and include elevated heart and respiratory rates, increased body temperature and blood pressure, and many other speci c behavioural signs (Dobromylskyj et al. 2000). It should be taken into account that the same observations can result in multiple interpretations because of differences in experience, training and 'philosophy 'between veterinarians, owners and others involved with the care of the horse. In the authors ' experience, serial evaluation of heart rate remains one of the most sensitive indicators of pain and response to analgesia; however, physiological parameters like the heart rate can be decisively affected by factors other than pain. In equine practice, repeated measures are recommended and factors such as excitability and unfamiliar surroundings need to be considered. In recently published literature, composite pain scales have been described for various types of pain (de Grauw and van Loon 2016). These scales include speci c behaviours like restlessness, sweating, weight shifting, muscle tremors, poor appetite, but also aggression towards humans, and/or a lack of response. Facial expression alone has been used to assess the presence and severity of pain in horses (Dalla Costa et al. 2016). Use of facial expression for pain scoring is rapid to carry out and observers can easily be trained. However, these scales still need to be validated and adapted for laminitic pain in horses. For the assessment of laminitic pain, more speci c changes in behaviour need to be considered. Incessant shifting of weight is one of the rst and most subtle signs of laminitis pain. The use of human pedometers attached to the antebrachium (to document weight shifting frequency) have provided useful information in a research setting where they proved to be more sensitive than visual assessment alone (van Eps et al. 2012). Pedometers (or accelerometer devices with bespoke equine algorithms) may be useful for quantitative measurement of limb weight shifting frequency in horses at risk of developing supporting limb laminitis and could also provide an indication \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd386 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019Platinum Performance\u00ae formulas are only available from your licensed equine veterinarian or direct from Platinum Performance\u00ae.

Since inflammation is considered an important component of the pathophysiology of laminitis (and appears to be involved in perpetuation of the lesion), it is rational to treat with NSAIDs in acute and chronic laminitis (Pollitt 2001; Blikslager et al. 2006; Belknap et al. 2007). Inflammatory processes are a feature of sepsis-related laminitis models in the developmental stage and the acute stage (when horses begin to exhibit signs of digital pain). Inflammation is also a feature of endocrinopathic and supporting limb laminitis once it has progressed to the acute stage; therefore, NSAIDs may also help to control inflammatory processes in these cases. Despite this, there is no evidence that NSAID administration actually alters disease progression in laminitis through inhibition of the local inflammatory response. There are two main forms of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme: COX-1 and COX-2. In the gastrointestinal tract, COX-1 helps to maintain mucosal perfusion and acid resistance and it is also important for maintenance of kidney perfusion and platelet function. COX-2 is primarily induced and found at sites of inflammation. Therefore, the more COX 2-selective NSAIDs (rocoxib, meloxicam) are potentially associated with fewer side effects and their use in chronic laminitis cases is often clinically desirable. However, control of lamellar inflammation may not be the primary mechanism by which NSAIDs mediate their analgesic effects in laminitis: rather inhibition of central sensory neurons may be more important (Driessen et al. 2010). Experimental evidence suggests that inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 produces superior analgesia than inhibition of either alone (Martinez et al. 2002). Also, NSAIDs appear to have analgesic effects that are independent of their effects on peripheral in flammation: for example, a comparison of ketoprofen (moderately preferential for COX-1) and parecoxib (selective for COX-2) in a rodent model showed that although the peripheral anti-in flammatory effects of parecoxib were greater than ketoprofen, ketoprofen still produced greater inhibition of nociceptive spinal neurons (Urdaneta et al. 2009). This helps to explain the anecdotally superior analgesic effect of nonselective NSAIDs like phenylbutazone for laminitis pain in horses, a phenomenon that is widely recognised in clinical practice. Serial measurement of serum total protein (hypoproteinaemia is an early indicator of right dorsal colitis) and urinalysis (for the presence of protein, casts and microhaematuria indicating renal damage) are the most sensitive means of monitoring horses for the main side effects of NSAIDs. Opioids Opioids play an important role in human pain management and their importance in veterinary practice is growing. While their use in small animals is widespread, the application of opioids in equine medicine is still limited, with the main reason being the opioid-associated side effects which includeincreased locomotion, excitation and increased risk of large intestinal impactions (Price et al. 2002). Opioids are usually considered as an adjunctive therapeutic to NSAIDs, especially in severely painful states. There are two main opioid receptors relevant for the analgesic effects of opioids: land j. The l-receptors are distributed throughout the neuraxis with the highest densities found in the thalamus, neocortex and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Their activation leads to strong analgesia. The j-receptors are located predominantly in the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus, and their activation is associated with less analgesia but also fewer side effects (Carregaro et al. 2014). Morphine, the prototypic opioid, is a full l-receptor agonist and cutaneous, as well as visceral pain models demonstrate its analgesic ef cacy in horses (Kalpravidh et al. 1984). Methadone is a synthetic opioid with agonistic effects mainly at the l-receptor and furthermore has antagonistic effects at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (Gorman et al. 1997), which could play an important role in processing within central pain pathways. Both agonists have a slow onset of a few minutes, and the duration of action is dose dependent but usually 3 -4 h. In contrast to morphine and methadone, butorphanol is a j-agonist and l-antagonist and it is commonly used in equine medicine. It has a short duration of action of 60 -90 min (Kalpravidh et al. 1984) and may have less negative effects on the intestinal tract, the cardiopulmonary system and behaviour in horses (Roger et al. 1994). Buprenorphine is a l-opioid-agonist and j-opioid- antagonist, which has been claimed to have a ceiling effect. When applied as a sole analgesic agent in horses, measurable antinociception has been reported to occur at doses of 10 lg/kg bwt or higher, lasting for up to 10 h (Bennett and Steffey 2002). Although being potent and effective pain killers, opioids are restrictively used because of their strong side effects, particularly where the requirement for analgesic therapy may be prolonged as is the case in chronic laminitis. Recently, Spahn and colleagues designed a l-agonist that selectively activates peripheral l-opioid receptors at the source of pain generation (Spahn et al. 2017). This yielded a novel opioid analgesia of similar ef cacy to conventional opioids, however, without detrimental side effects. The incorporation of opioid therapy into the regular management of laminitis is likely to require the development and validation of similar novel agents in the horse. Systemic lidocaine Systemic lidocaine is used in equine medicine as a treatment for post-operative ileus (Brianceau et al. 2002), but it has also been reported to have inhibitory effects on a broad spectrum of systemic in flammatory processes (Hollmann and Durieux 2000). However, a study evaluating the effects of systemic lidocaine therapy on the in flammatory processes during a black walnut extract model of laminitis indicated that systemic lidocaine at concentrations achievable in the clinical setting did not exert anti-in flammatory properties (Williams et al. 2010). Besides its well-studied local anaesthetic actions in the peripheral and central nervous system, it also has analgesic effects through inhibition of spinal and supraspinal nociception when administered systemically (Ness 2000) and, therefore, is also used as an analgesic adjunct in multimodal pain therapy. Experimental studies have found i.v. lidocaine to suppress development of peripheral \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd387 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JULY 20192019hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain) and allodynia (increased sensitivity to nonpainful stimuli) (Ness 2000). Furthermore, it has been shown to be bene cial in chronic pain with hyperalgesia and/or allodynia (Gormsen et al. 2009). In horses, lidocaine infusions (3 mg/kg/h) have been shown to produce moderate analgesia during somatic pain models (Robertson et al. 2005). The requirement for i.v. infusion means lidocaine is unsuitable for long-term administration in chronic laminitis cases; however, lidocaine infusion is a useful adjunctive analgesia in horses with acute pain from either an active laminitis episode or when a procedure (e.g. hoof resection or other surgery) is likely to cause acute pain, and can be used pre-emptively to avoid hyperalgesia. Ketamine Ketamine also induces analgesia through numerous signalling pathways, with NMDA receptor antagonism appearing to be the most important (Craven 2007). In an orthopaedic pain model in otherwise healthy experimental horses 'responses to ketamine varied from no analgesia to marked improvement of comfort within 6 -12 h after starting the drug infusion (Lankveld et al. 2006). Ketamine has been shown to regulate in flammatory responses and to reduce hyperalgesia, and its administration results in almost complete remission of symptoms of refractory neuropathic pain in human patients (Craven 2007). Results of a recent study indicated that a short-term infusion of ketamine at a subanaesthetic dose (0.6 mg/kg/h over 6 h) had an analgesic effect in horses with chronic laminitis-associated pain when used in combination with orally administered tramadol (Guedes et al. 2012). These effects included a reduction in blood pressure variables and improvement in off-loading frequency and total load of the affected limbs. However, despite the improvement in lameness, many of the variables remained substantially elevated, compared with the values for healthy horses. A low-dose ketamine infusion should be considered an adjunctive therapy for treating central hyperalgesia in laminitic patients, although due to the dosing and regulatory requirements for this drug it is only suitable for short-term treatment. Gabapentin Gabapentin is an effective analgesia in human neuropathic and chronic pain which has also been used in acute pain to inhibit the processes of temporal summation and spinal cord 'wind-up '(Harding et al. 2005; Arendt-Nielsen et al. 2007). Although it is increasingly used in equine practice, there is currently no data on whether gabapentin has analgesic effects in horses. Gabapentin has low bioavailability in horses (16%) (Terry et al. 2010) and, therefore, must be used at high doses orally (at least 5 -20 mg/kg bwt 2 -3 times per day). Intravenous infusion or oral administration of gabapentin may be appropriate in acute laminitis cases, keeping in mind that there is currently no commercially available injectable preparation for horses. The authors routinely administer oral gabapentin to clinical cases with acute and chronic laminitis without ill-effect. Unfortunately, it is very dif cult to accurately assess whether gabapentin improves analgesia in these cases. The main side effect of gabapentin administration in horses is mild sedation and tranquilisation (Terry et al. 2010). However, this may actually be of bene t in acute laminitiscases as recumbency and reduced ambulation are encouraged which protects the tissues from further damage caused by weightbearing and ambulation. Gabapentin may be suitable for long-term oral in with chronic laminitis. Alpha-2 agonists Alpha-2 agonists provide analgesia primarily through spinal and supraspinal mechanisms, although peripheral mechanisms may contribute (Valverde 2010). All alpha-2 agonists can be used as a single i.v. or i.m. dose and may be combined with other medications for constant infusion (Abrahamsen 2005). As Table 1 indicates, the dosing range is wide, with higher doses tending to produce longer durations of effect, but also causing more adverse effects including decreases in gastric emptying and intestinal motility which is more profound upon repeated, continuous and/or higher dose administration (Freeman and England 2001; Sutton et al. 2002; Elfenbein et al. 2009). The analgesic properties of alpha-2 agonists should not be underestimated and these drugs are particularly useful in severe acute pain states or when the combination of short-term analgesia and sedation is desirable, e.g., for procedures such as shoeing, standing surgery or diagnostic radiography. Systemic medications under development/investigation One case report describes the use of acetaminophen as an adjunctive analgesic agent in a pony with severe laminitis where acetaminophen as an adjunct showed some improvement of the lameness (West et al. 2011). The mechanisms of action of acetaminophen are not yet completely understood. It does not appear to inhibit the function of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes outside the central nervous system, but it is a strong inhibitor of the central COX-3 enzyme (Graham and Scott 2005). COX-3 (COX-1b) is an enzyme that is encoded by the COX-1 gene and is mainly present in the cerebrospinal fluid and therefore only involved in central pain perception. Acetaminophen also acts on TRPA1-receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Andersson et al. 2011) and modulates the endogenous cannabinoid system via inhibition of TRPV-1 receptors (Ottani et al. 2006). These receptors are important for peripheral nociception, and this may explain the peripheral analgesic effects of acetaminophen. Controlled studies are needed to show whether acetaminophen has a place in laminitis therapy. Among the novel anti-in flammatory and analgesic medications under investigation, a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor has shown some promising results. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases mediate a relatively unexplored pathway of by which endogenous bioactive lipids, known as epoxy-fatty acids, are produced (Wagner et al. 2011). It has been shown that pharmacological inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase results in stabilisation of epoxy-fatty acids and anti-nociceptive effects that are greater than COX inhibitors, opioids or gabapentin (Morisseau et al. 2010). A recent study showed that soluble epoxide hydrolase activity was signi cantly increased in horses with active chronic laminitis compared with healthy horses and that several inhibitors initially designed to inhibit the human enzyme are also active against equine soluble epoxide hydrolase (Guedes et al. 2013, AE / JULY 20192019with severe chronic laminitis resulted in mild to moderate, statistically signi cant, decreases in forelimb lifts and pain scores, suggesting that t-TUCB helped control pain associated with laminitis (Guedes et al. 2016a). These results argue for a role of endogenous bioactive lipids in laminitis pain signalling and support further exploration into manipulating these molecules, via soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibition or other strategies, as an additional therapeutic approach for laminitis analgesia. Tramadol is a synthetic, centrally acting analgesic therapy with a multimodal mechanism of action as it activates l- opioid receptors and inhibits neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (Driessen et al. 1993). In human patients with in flammatory and neuropathic pain states, tramadol may also produce analgesia modulation inflammatory mediators such as proin flammatory cytokines and prostanoids, but this mechanism is less likely in horses (Guedes et al. 2012). When administered orally to horses it has a low bioavailability (Knych et al. 2013). In human patients, tramadol undergoes hepatic metabolism producing active metabolites (Subrahmanyam et al. 2001), which are important for the analgesic effects. In horses this hepatic metabolism and the production of metabolites is different and often reduced. Whether the metabolites produced in horses have signi cant biological activity is not known. A recent study on four horses with laminitis showed that tramadol administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg bwt intravenously twice daily produced analgesic plasma levels and decreased the forelimb off-loading frequency signi cantly (Guedes et al. 2016b). Therefore, more studies are warranted to investigate the analgesic potency of tramadol for treatment of laminitic pain. Amitriptyline tricyclic The tricyclic antidepressants to relieve neuropathic pain rstemerged from observations in depressed patients treated with imipramine (Paoli et al. 1960). Since the 1980s, clinical trials have con rmed the bene t of amitriptyline to relieve post-herpetic neuropathic pain and painful diabetic polyneuropathy (Max et al. 1987). To date, there are no studies in horses on the ef cacy of amitriptyline but extrapolation from human medicine suggests that evaluation in horses as an adjunctive analgesic therapy for controlling chronic laminitis pain may be warranted. Regional techniques Peripheral nerve blocks can be useful in laminitis cases especially when temporary profound analgesia is required. Lidocaine and mepivacaine are the local anaesthetic agents most commonly used to induce regional anaesthesia, however, for longer pain relief either a continuous application of these drugs or longer acting local anaesthetics like bupivacaine or ropivacaine need to be used. The addition of a-2-adrenoceptor agonists, such as dexmedetomidine, to local anaesthetic agents has been used to intensify and prolong the conduction block produced (Brummett et al. 2008). A technique for continuous peripheral nerve block of the palmar nerves using commercially available catheters and syringe pumps is well described elsewhere (Driessen et al. 2008; Zarucco et al. 2010). This technique is particularly useful for blocking nociception over extended periods if a painful procedure (e.g. hoof resection) is required, especially when the technique is performed pre-emptively (avoiding 'wind-up '). These authors have also successfully used this technique in the research setting. In chronic and severely painful conditions, a continuous nerve block may be useful to help temporarily avoid excessive weightbearing on the supporting limbs and, thus, help reduce the risk of supporting limbTABLE 1: Systemic analgesic medications for the treatment of laminitis Drug Dose Target Side effects oral and gastric ulceration /C15Decreased renal perfusion and 10 min followed by 3 mg/kg/hSodium channels muscle tremors (rare) Ketamine 0.3-0.6 mg/kg/h i.m./i.v.

However, loss of nociception can be associated with increased ambulation and weightbearing on laminitic limbs (loss of pain associated inhibition/preservation) and, therefore, worsening of existing laminitis pathology. Therefore, care must be taken to balance the requirement for peripheral nerve blocks against the potential detrimental effects in established laminitis cases. Epidural analgesia can be useful to control pain associated with fore- and hindlimb laminitis and long-term pain management can be facilitated by placement of an epidural catheter. Drugs including opioids, tramadol, alpha-2- adrenergic agonists, local anaesthetics and ketamine have been investigated. These drugs are often used at much smaller doses than if they were administered systemically and are associated with fewer side effects. Further, side effects occurring from epidural injection itself are rare (infection, temporary nerve damage, bleeding). Morphine is probably the most useful as its analgesic effects are long lasting (12 - 24 h) and it does not cause ataxia. Administration of larger volumes of drugs (by dilution) into the epidural space may facilitate cranial migration of the drugs and contribute to some analgesia of the thoracic limbs: A combination bwt) and morphine (0.2 mg/kg bwt) diluted to a volume of 0.2 mL per 1 kg bwt administered epidurally is effective for providing front limb analgesia. Therapeutic hypothermia may also provide analgesia through a combination of profound anti-in flammatory effects and also direct effects on nerve conduction and may be a useful adjunctive analgesic strategy in horses with acute laminitis (van Eps 2010). Apparent analgesic effects of cooling have been noted in experimental laminitis models (van Eps et al. 2012, 2014); however, evidence of an analgesic effect in clinical patients with painful limb conditions is lacking. Preliminary data showed increased mechanical nociceptive threshold in horses when the limb skin temperature decreases below 7 \u00b0C (A.W. van Eps, unpublished data 2018). Therapeutic hypothermia could prove useful clinically for managing severe laminitis pain, but also as an adjunctive measure to reduce primary limb pain in horses at risk of supporting limb laminitis. Conclusion Advancements in our understanding of the complex physiology and pathophysiology of laminitis pain have made it clear that effective and safe analgesic therapy is unlikely to be achieved through the use of a single drug with a single mode of action, particularly in severe and/or chronic cases. Although NSAIDs remain the rst choice for analgesia and are effective in many cases, implementation of multimodal or balanced analgesia using other systemic medications and regional techniques may be of bene t in treating both acute and chronic laminitis pain more effectively with less side effects.
