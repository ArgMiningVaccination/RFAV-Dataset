Or call the Member Services number on Your Identification Card.17 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4UHow Your Plan Works This is Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) health insurance coverage. To get benefits for Covered Services, You must use In-Network Providers, unless Your care involves an Emergency situation. The Summary of Benefits lists out-of-pocket expenses You may incur. We strive to maintain reasonable health care costs by working with Physicians, Hospitals, other Providers and Members in unity. When Members and Physicians work together to obtain care from Specialists and to obtain Preauthorization for services, Members can help ensure that they receive care that is Medically Necessary, performed in the appropriate setting, and is otherwise a Covered Service. A result of Member and Physician collaboration is lower cost of health care. Primary Care Physicians (In-Network Providers) The Primary Care Physician (PCP) is the Doctor who normally gives, directs, and manages Your health care. PCPs include general practitioners, internists, family practitioners, pediatricians, and geriatricians. While You are not required to choose a PCP, You should choose an In-Network Provider who is listed in the Provider directory. This can either be a PCP or a Specialist. Each Member of a family may select a different PCP. For example, an internist or general practitioner may be chosen for adults and a pediatrician may be selected for children. Regardless of medical necessity, no benefits will be provided for care that is not a Covered Service, even if performed by the PCP, or another In-Network Provider such as a Specialist. How to Find a Provider in the Network There are three ways You can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the network. You can also find out where they are located and details about their license or training. \u00b7Go to the directory of In-Network Providers at www.anthem.com .Here You can find lists of Doctors, Providers, and Facilities that participate in Our network. \u00b7Call Customer Service to ask for a list of Doctors and Providers that participate in Our network, based on specialty and geographic area. \u00b7Check with Your Doctor or Provider. If You need help choosing a Doctor who is right for You, call the Customer Service number on the back of Your Member Identification Card. TTY/TDD services also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get in touch with Us to help with Your needs. Visiting a Provider in the Network In-Network Providers include Primary Care Physicians/Providers (PCP's), Specialists (Specialty Care Physicians/Providers (SCP's), other Professional Providers, Hospitals, and other facilities who contract with Us to care for You. Referrals are never needed to visit an In-Network Specialist including behavioral health Providers. You do not need a referral from Us or from any other person (including a PCP) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in Our network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. To see a Physician, call their office: \u00b7Tell them You are Our Member. \u00b7Have Your Identification Card handy. The Physician's office may ask You for Your group or ID number. \u00b7Tell them the reason for Your visit. When You go to the office, be sure to bring Your Identification Card with You.How Your Plan Works 18 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4UGuest Memberships When You or any of Your covered Dependents will be staying temporarily outside of the Service Area for more than 90 days, You can request a guest membership to a Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliated health maintenance organization in that area. An example of when this service may be utilized is when a Dependent student attends a school outside of the Service Area. Call Customer Services at the number on the back of Your Identification Card to make sure that the area in which You or Your Dependents are staying is within the Guest Membership Network. The Guest Membership Network is a network of Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliated plans. If the area is within the network, You will need to complete a guest membership application and You will receive benefit/plan information as well as an Identification Card from the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliate where You or Your covered Dependents will be staying. A Customer Services representative will explain any limitations or restrictions to this benefit. If You are staying in an area that is not within the Guest Membership Network, this service will not be available. Identification Card When You get care, You must show Your Identification Card. Only a Member who has paid the Premium for this coverage has the right to services or benefits under this Certificate. If anyone gets services or benefits to which they are not entitled to under the terms of this Certificate, he/she must pay for the actual cost of the services. Maximum Allowed (Allowable) Amount (MAA) General Reimbursement for services rendered by In-Network Providers is based on the Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that You receive. Please see the \"Inter-Plan Arrangements\" section of this Certificate for additional information. The Maximum Allowed Amount is the maximum amount of reimbursement Wewill allow for services and supplies: \u00b7That meet Our definition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered under Your Certificate and are not excluded. \u00b7That are Medically Necessary; and \u00b7That are provided in accordance with all applicable Preauthorization, Utilization Management or other requirements set forth in Your Certificate. You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met Your Deductible or have a Copayment or Co-insurance. In addition, when You receive Covered Services from a Non-Participating Provider, You may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider's actual charges. This amount can be significant. Generally, services received from an Out-of-Network Provider under this Certificate are not covered except for Emergency Care, or when allowed as a result of a Preauthorization by Us. When You receive Covered Services from an Out-of-Network Provider, You may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider's actual charges. This amount can be significant. When You receive Covered Services from a Provider, We will, to the extent applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect Our determination of the Maximum Allowed Amount. Our application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services You received were not M edically Necessary .It only means We have determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, Your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount willHow Your Plan Works 19 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4Ube based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. When multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Provider, or other healthcare professional, We may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amount s for those secondary and subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. Provider Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is an In-Network Provider or an Out-of-Network Provider. An In-Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specific Certificate or in a special Center of Excellence/or other closely managed specialty network. For Covered Services performed by an In-Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this plan is the rate the Provider has agreed with Us to accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because In-Network Provider s have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send You a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum Allowed Amount .However, You may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met Your Deductible or have a Copayment orCo-insurance .Please call Customer Service for help in finding an In-Network Provider or visit Our website at www.anthem.com . Providers who have not signed any contract with Us and are not in any of Our networks are Out-of- Network Providers, subject to Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules governing claims filed by certain ancillary Providers. ForCovered Services You receive from an Out-of-Network Provider that have been Preauthorized by Us, theMaximum Allowed Amount for this plan will be one of the following as determined by Us: 1)An amount based on Our Out-of-Network Provider fee schedule/rate, which We have established in Our discretion, and which We reserve the right to modify from time to time, after considering one or more of the following: reimbursement amounts for like/similar Providers, reimbursement amounts for like/similar Providers contracted with Us, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies, and other industry cost, reimbursement and utilization data; or 2)An amount based on reimbursement or cost information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). When basing the Maximum Allowed Amount upon the level or method of reimbursement used by CMS, We will update such information, which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less than annually; or 3)An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect one or more of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment; or (3) comparable Providers' fees and costs to deliver care, or 4)An amount negotiated by Us or a third party vendor which has been agreed to by the Provider. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management; or 5)An amount based on or derived from the total charges billed by the Out-of-Network Provider. Providers who are not contracted for this product, but contracted for other products with Us are also considered Out-of-Network. For this plan the Maximum Allowed Amount reimbursement for services from these Providers will be one of the five methods shown above unless the contract between Us and that Provider specifies a different amount.How Your Plan Works 20 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4UUnlike In-Network Providers, Out-of-Network Providers may send You a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider's charge that exceeds Our Maximum Allowed Amount. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount can be significant. Choosing an In-Network Provider will likely result in lower out of pocket costs to You. Please call Customer Service for help in finding an In-Network Provider or visit Our website at www.anthem.com . Customer Service is also available to assist You in determining this plan's Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from an Out-of-Network Provider. In order for Us to assist You, You will need to obtain from Your Provider the specific procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will render. You will also need to know the Provider's charges to calculate Your out of pocket responsibility. Although Customer Service can assist You with this pre-service information, the final Maximum Allowed Amount for Your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted. For Prescription Drugs: The Maximum Allowed Amount for Prescription Drugs is the amount determined by Us using Prescription Drug cost information provided by the Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM). Member Cost Share For certain Covered Services and depending on Your plan, You may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as Your Cost-Share amount (for example, Deductible, Copayment, and/or Co- insurance). We will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You will be responsible for the total amount billed by Your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are performed by an In-Network or Out-of-Network Provider. Non-Covered Services include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of Your plan, and services received after benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, Your day/visit limits. In some instances You may only be asked to pay the lower In-Network Cost-Sharing amount when You use an Out-of-Network Provider. For example, if You go to an In-Network Hospital or Provider Facility and receive Covered Services from an Out-of-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who is employed by or contracted with an In-Network Hospital or facility, You will pay the In- Network Cost Share amounts for those Covered Services. However, You also may be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out-of-Network Provider's charge. Authorized Services In some non-Emergency circumstances, such as where there is no In-Network Provider available for the Covered Service, We may Preauthorize the In-Network Cost-Share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Co-insurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service You receive from an Out-of-Network Provider. In such circumstance, You must contact Us in advance of obtaining the Covered Service. We also will authorize In-Network Cost-Share amounts to apply to a claim for Covered Services if You receive Emergency Services from an Out-of-Network Provider and are not able to contact Us until after the Covered Service is rendered. If We authorize an In-Network Cost Share amount to apply to a Covered Service received from an Out-of-Network Provider, You may also still be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out-of-Network Provider's charge. Please contact Customer Service for Preauthorization information or to request Authorization. Deductible Calculation The In-Network and Out-of-Network Deductibles are separate and do not apply toward each other. The family Deductible is also applicable for newborn and adopted children for the first 31 day period following birth or adoption if the child is enrolled or not enrolled following the 31 day period. The Deductible applies to most Covered Services even those with a zero percent Co-insurance. An example of services not subject to the Deductible is In-Network Preventive Care Services required by law. Generally, Copayments are not subject to and do not apply to the Deductible, however to confirm how Your plan works, please refer to the Summary of Benefits.How Your Plan Works 21 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4UThe Deductible and Copayment/Co-insurance amount incurred in a Year apply to the Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum. Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum Calculation The Deductible, Co-insurance and Copayment amounts incurred in a Year apply to the Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum. Once the Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum is satisfied, no additional Cost Sharing will be required for the remainder of the Year. Benefit Period Maximum Some Covered Services have a day or visit limit that We will allow during each Benefit Period. This is called the Benefit Period Maximum. When the Deductible applies to a Covered Service that has a limit, the limit will be reduced by the amount applied the Deductible. It does not matter whether or not the Covered Service is paid by HMO Nevada .These limits apply even if You have met the Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum. These limits apply even if some or all of the claims first applied to meet Your Deductible. See the Summary of Benefits for services that have a Benefit Period Maximum. Requesting Approval for Benefits Preauthorization: In-Network Providers must obtain Preauthorization in order for You to get benefits for certain services. Preauthorization criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy, clinical guidelines, and Pharmacy and Therapeutics guidelines. We may decide that a service that was prescribed or asked for is not Medically Necessary if You have not first tried other Medically Necessary and more cost effective treatments. If You have any questions about the information in this section, You may call the Customer Service phone number on the back of Your Identification Card. Types of Requests : \u00b7Precertification - A required review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination which must be done before the service, treatment or admission start date. For Emergency admissions, You, Your authorized representative or Doctor must tell Us within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. For labor / childbirth admissions, Precertification is not needed unless there is a problem and/or the mother and baby are not sent home at the same time. \u00b7Predetermination - An optional, voluntary Prospective or Continued Stay Review request for a benefit coverage determination for a service or treatment. We will check Your Certificate to find out if there is an Exclusion for the service or treatment. If there is a related clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical Necessity under this Certificate or is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Certificate. \u00b7Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A retrospective review for a benefit coverage determination to decide the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a service, treatment or admission that did not need Precertification and did not have a Predetermination review performed. Medical Reviews are done for a service, treatment or admission in which We have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by Us. Typically, In-Network Providers know which services need Precertification and will get any Precertification or ask for a Predetermination when needed. Your Primary Care Physician and other In-Network Providers have been given detailed information about these procedures and are responsible for meeting these requirements. Generally, the ordering Provider, Facility or attending Doctor will get in touch with Us to ask for a Precertification or Predetermination review (\"requesting Provider\"). We will work with the requesting Provider for the Precertification request. However, You may choose an authorizedHow Your Plan Works 22 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4Urepresentative to act on Your behalf for a specific request. The authorized representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or older. Who is responsible for Precertification Services given by an In-Network ProviderServices given by a BlueCard/Out-of-Network/non-participating Provider ProviderMember has no benefit coverage for an Out-of-Network Provider unless: \u00b7You get Authorization to use an Out-of-Network Provider before the service is given; or \u00b7For Emergency admissions, You, Your authorized representative or Doctor must tell Us within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. We will use Our clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy and other internally developed clinical guidelines, procedures, and Preventive Care clinical coverage guidelines, to help make Our Medical Necessity decisions, including decisions about Prescription and Specialty Drug services. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines from time to time. We will administer benefits for any Medically Necessary determination, as decided solely by Us notwithstanding that it might otherwise be found to be investigational as that term is defined in the Policy otherwise Your Certificate take precedence over these guidelines. You are entitled to ask for and get, free of charge, reasonable access to any records on which We based Our determination. To ask for this information, call the Preauthorization phone number on the back of Your Identification Card. We may, from time to time, waive, enhance, modify or discontinue certain medical management processes (including Utilization Management, case management, and disease management) if in Our discretion, such change is in furtherance of the provision of cost effective, value based and/or quality services. In addition, We may select certain qualifying Providers to participate in a program that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would otherwise apply. We may also exempt Your claim from medical review if certain conditions apply. Just because We exempt a process, Provider or claim from the standards which otherwise would apply, it does not mean that We will do so in the future, or will do so in the future for any other Provider, claim or Member. We may stop or modify any such exemption with or without advance notice. You may determine whether a Provider is participating in certain programs by checking Your on-line Provider Directory, on-line pre-certification list or contacting the Customer Service at the number listed on Your Identification Card. We also may identify certain Providers to review for potential fraud, waste, abuse or other inappropriate activity if the claims data suggests there may be inappropriate billing practices. If a Provider is selected under this program, then We may use one or more clinical utilization management guidelines in the review of claims submitted by this Provider, even if those guidelines are not used for all Providers delivering services to plan's Members. Request CategoriesHow Your Plan Works 23 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4U\u00b7Expedited - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is in the view of the treating Provider or any Doctor with knowledge of Your medical condition, could without such care or treatment, seriously threaten Your life or health or Your ability to regain maximum function or subject You to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without such care or treatment. \u00b7Prospective - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted before the service, treatment or admission. \u00b7Continued Stay Review - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted during the course of treatment or admission. \u00b7Retrospective - A request for approval that is made after the service, treatment or admission has happened. Post Service Clinical Claims Reviews are also retrospective. Retrospective review does not include a review that is limited to an evaluation of reimbursement levels, accuracy of documentation or coding or adjudication of payment. Decision and Notice Requirements We will review requests for benefits according to the timeframes listed below. The timeframes and requirements listed are based on State and federal laws. Where State laws are stricter than federal laws, We will follow State laws. If You live in and/or get services in a State other than the State where Your Certificate was issued other State-specific requirements may apply. You may call the phone number on the back of Your Identification Card for more details. Request Category Timeframe Requirement for Decision and Notification Prospective Expedited 72 hours from the receipt of request Prospective Non-Expedited 15 calendar days from the receipt of the request Continued Stay Review Expedited when hospitalized at the time of the request72 hours from the receipt of the request and prior to expiration of current certification.

If We do not get the specific information We need or if the information is not complete by the timeframe identified in the written notice, We will make a decision based upon the information We have.How Your Plan Works 24 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4UWe will give notice of Our decision as required by State and federal law. Notice may be given by the following methods: Verbal : Oral notice given to the requesting Provider by phone or by electronic means if agreed to by the Provider. Written : Mailed letter or electronic means including email and fax given to, at a minimum, the requesting Provider and You or Your authorized representative. Precertification does not guarantee coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed. For benefits to be covered, on the date You get service: 1)You must be eligible for benefits; 2)Premium must be paid for the time period that services are given; 3)The service cannot be subject to an Exclusion under Your Certificate; and 4)You must not have exceeded any applicable limits under Your Certificate. We have processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud, waste, abuse and other inappropriate activity. Members could be balanced billed by the Out-of-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not payable as a result of these review processes. A claim may also be determined to be not payable due to a Provider's failure to submit medical records with the claims that are under review in these processes. Health Plan Individual Case Management Our health plan case management programs (Case Management) help coordinate services for Members with health care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions. Our programs coordinate benefits and educate Members who agree to take part in the Case Management Program to help meet their health-related needs. Our Case Management programs are confidential and voluntary and are made available at no extra cost to You. These programs are provided by, or on behalf of and at the request of, Your health plan case management staff. These Case Management Programs are separate from any Covered Services You are receiving. If You meet program criteria and agree to take part, We will help You meet Your identified health care needs. This is reached through contact and team work with You and/or Your chosen representative, treating Doctor(s), and other Providers. In addition, We may assist in coordinating care with existing community-based programs and services to meet Your needs. This may include giving You information about external agencies and community- based programs and services. In certain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, We may provide benefits for alternate care that is not listed as a Covered Service through Our Case Management program. We may also extend Covered Services beyond the Benefit Maximums of this Certificate. We will make Our decision case-by-case, if in Our discretion the alternate or extended benefit is in the best interest of the Member and Us. A decision to provide extended benefits or approve alternate care in one case does not obligate Us to provide the same benefits again to You or to any other Member. We reserve the right, at any time, to alter or stop providing extended benefits or approving alternate care. In such case, We will notify You or Your representative in writing. Inter-Plan Arrangements Out-of-area services We cover only limited healthcare services received outside of Our Service Area. For example, Emergency or Urgent Care obtained out of Our Service Area is always covered. For those out-of-area healthcare services that We do cover, and which are obtained from Providers(s) that have a contractual agreement with a local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee (\"Host Blue\") with which We have aHow Your Plan Works 25 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4Urelationship (referred to as an \"Inter-Plan Program\"), a claim for those services may be processed through an Inter-Plan Program. If so, the claim will be presented to Us for payment in accordance with the then current rules that apply to these Programs. These Programs include the BlueCard\u00ae Program, which is described in general terms below. BlueCard\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard Program, when You obtain out-of-area Covered Services and supplies within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, We will remain responsible for fulfilling its contractual obligations. But the Host Blue is responsible for: (a) contracting with its participating Providers; and (b) handling interactions with those Providers. The BlueCard Program allows You to obtain out-of-area Covered Services and supplies from a healthcare Provider participating with a Host Blue, where available. The participating Provider will automatically file a claim for those Covered Services and supplies, so there are no claim forms to fill out. You are liable for the applicable Copayment or Co-insurance stated in this Certificate. Whenever You obtain Covered Services or supplies outside Our Service Area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount You pay for them, if not a Copayment, is calculated based on the lower of: \u00b7The billed Covered Charges for the Covered Services or Supplies; or \u00b7The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Us. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to the Provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with the Provider or Provider group that may include: types of settlements; incentive payments; and/or other credits or charges. Sometimes, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of Providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of modifications of past pricing for the types of transaction modifications noted above. But such adjustments will not affect any price that We have already paid for Your claim or Your liability for any such claim. Also, federal law or laws in a small number of States may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to a claim calculation. If federal law or any State laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, We would then calculate Your liability for any Covered Service or supply according to applicable law. Non-Participating Healthcare Providers Outside Our Service Area As mentioned under \"Out-of Area Services\" above, We only cover limited healthcare services outside of its Service Area. If You need to go to a non-participating, out-of-area Provider for Emergency or Urgent Care, the charges for that care are covered. To the extent that the services of non-participating, out-of- area Providers are covered, the amount that You pay for the provided services, if not a Copayment, will generally be based on either the Host Blue's local payment to that Provider or any pricing arrangement required by applicable State law. In some cases, We may pay claims from non-participating Providers outside of Our Service Area based on the Provider's billed charge. For example, this could happen in a case where You did not have reasonable access to a participating Provider, as determined by Us or in accordance with applicable State law. In other cases, We may pay such a claim based on the payment We would make if We were paying a non-participating Provider inside of Our Service Area. This could happen when the Host Blue's payment for the service would be more than Our payment for the service. Also, at Our discretion, We may negotiate a payment with such a Provider on an exception basis.

See Your Summary of Benefits for Your Cost Share amounts, such as Deductibles and/or any Co-insurance. Your Dental Benefits We do not determine whether the Dental Services listed in this section are Medically Necessary to treat Your specific condition or restore Your dentition. There is a preset schedule of dental care services that are covered under this policy. We evaluate the procedures submitted to Us on Your claim to determine if they are a covered service under this policy. EXCEPTION: Claims for orthodontic care will be reviewed to determine if it was Dentally Necessary Orthodontic Care. See the section \"Orthodontic Care\" for more information. Your dentist may recommend or prescribe other dental care services that are not covered, are cosmetic in nature, or exceed the benefit frequencies of this policy. While these services may be necessary for Your dental condition, they may not be covered by Us. There may be an alternative dental care service available to You that is covered under Your policy. These alternative services are called optional treatments. If an allowance for an optional treatment is available, You may apply this allowance to the initial dental care service prescribed by Your dentist. You are responsible for any costs that exceed the allowance, in addition to any Co-insurance or Deductible You may have. The decision as to what dental care treatment is best for You is solely between You and Your dentist. Pretreatment Estimates A pretreatment estimate is a valuable tool for You and Your dentist. It provides You and the dentist with an idea of what Your out of pocket costs will be for the dental care treatment. This will allow the dentistMember Benefits (What is Covered) 60 NV_OFF_HMO_(1/15) 1G4UandYou to make any necessary financial arrangements before treatment begins. It is a good idea to get a pretreatment estimate for dental care that involves major restorative, periodontic, prosthetic, or orthodontic care. The pretreatment estimate is recommended, but it is not required for You to receive benefits for covered dental care services. A pretreatment estimate does not authorize treatment or determine its medical necessity (except for orthodontics), and does not guarantee benefits. The estimate will be based on Your current eligibility and the policy benefits in effect at the time the estimate is submitted to Us. This is an estimate only. Our final payment will be based on the claim that is submitted at the time of the completed dental care service(s). Submission of other claims, changes in Your eligibility or changes to the policy may affect Our final payment. You can ask Your dentist to submit a pretreatment estimate for You, or You can send it to Us Yourself. Please include the procedure codes for the services to be performed (Your dentist can tell You what procedures codes).
