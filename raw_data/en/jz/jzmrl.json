Most colloidal silvers contain only 10% of charged silver. Sovereign Silver contains >98% positively charged silver ions and silver nanoclusters, making it much more powerful, safer*, and a better value than other brands. The EPA has established a daily Oral Silver Reference Dose (RfD) of 350 micrograms (mcg). It is critical to know this when you look to buy a silver supplement because higher concentrations quickly take you above the safe limits.* Like an hourglass filled with sand compared to an hourglass filed with gravel, the smaller the particle size, the easier it is for the body to absorb and eliminate. Sovereign Silver features an unprecendented particle size as small as 0.8 nanometers, verified by 3rd party. While one teaspoon per day is perfect for daily immune support*, there will be times you will want to take silver up to 7x/day. Only 10 ppm can safely* be taken that often. For thousands of years, silver has played an essential role in safeguarding human health. In fact, until 1938, colloidal silver was the preferred choice of physicians for empowering the immune system and stimulating the body's innate healing processes. Today, as more people embrace natural ways to maintain their health and well-being, silver is experiencing a resurgence in popularity. And Sovereign Silver is leading the way. By developing technologically advanced refinements in the production of silver colloids, Sovereign Silver Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol delivers advantages no other manufacturer can match. The Sovereign Silver Difference Actively Charged - As corroborated by several universities, Sovereign Silver contains 96% positively charged silver particles [Ag(n)1+], making it at least 34 times more powerful than other brands. Easily Absorbed - Sovereign Silver's unprecedented particle size of 0.8 nanometers (validated by Transmission Electron Microscopy) allows for easy absorption and excretion from the body. Less is More - The smaller the particle, the greater the surface area and the higher the efficiency. That's why even with a low concentration of 10 ppm, Sovereign Silver is still much more effective than brands which contain up to 500 ppm! Perfectly Safe - Sovereign Silver is formulated to be safe for the whole family. Taken 7 times a day for 70 years, Sovereign Silver still falls below the EPA daily Oral Silver Reference Dose (RfD). 99.999% Pure - Sovereign Silver has only two ingredients: pure silver and pharmaceutical grade purified water. It does not contain added salts or proteins that render other silver products less effective. Plus, it is packaged in non-leaching glass bottles to guarantee purity throughout its shelf life. Suggested Use Adults: 1 teaspoon, hold under tongue for 30 seconds, then swallow. Children 4 years & older: 1/2 teaspoon. According to the EPA (CASRN 7440-22-4) daily Oral Silver Reference Dose (RfD) applied to 10 ppm, one may ingest 178,850 servings safely over 70 years. Guidelines: Maintenance: Once Daily.
