SARS-CoV-2 infects mainly lungs and may cause several immune-related complications, such as lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm, which are associated with the severity of the disease and predict mortality. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in immune system dysfunction is still not fully understood. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human CD4+ T helper cells, but not CD8+ T cells, and is present in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage T helper cells of severe COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) directly binds to the CD4 molecule, which in turn mediates the entry of SARS- CoV-2 in T helper cells. This leads to impaired CD4 T cell function and may cause cell death. SARS-CoV-2-infected T helper cells express higher levels of IL-10, which is associated with viral persistence and disease severity. Thus, CD4-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of T helper cells may contribute to a poor immune response in COVID-19 patients. Editor's evaluation This study represents an important contribution where SARS-CoV-2 infection of T-helper cells is implicated and found to be mediated by CD4. It identifies the interaction between spike RBD domain and N Terminal domain of CD4 molecule as the specific viral attachment strategy. This solid paper also provides a potential usefulness for future work in understanding how viruses mediate infection of T cells. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84790.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84790.sa0) Introduction Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths around the world. Most of the deaths are associated with acute pneumonia, cardiovascular complications, and organ failure due to hypoxia, exacerbated inflammatory responses, and widespread cell death ( [Candido et al., 2020](#bib7); [Laing et June, 2020](#bib43); [Zhang et al., 2020](#bib73)). Individuals that progress to the severe stages of COVID-19 manifest marked alterations in the immune response, characterized by reduced overall protein synthesis, cytokine storm, lymphocytopenia, and T cell exhaustion ( June, 2020](#bib43); [Thoms et al., 2020](#bib59)). In addition to these acute effects on the immune system, a considerable proportion of infected individuals present low titers of neutralizing antibodies ( [Robbiani et al., 2020](#bib48); [Souza et al., 2021](#bib55)). Moreover, the levels of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) decay rapidly after recovery in part of the infected individuals ( [Long et al., 2020](#bib37)), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may exert profound and long-lasting complications to adaptive immunity. Recently, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect lymphocytes ( [Pontelli et al., 2022](#bib46); [Shen et al., 2022](#bib54)). In this context, it is urgent to characterize the replicative capacity and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 replication in different immune cells, especially those involved with the formation of immunological memory and effective adaptive response, such as CD4+ T lymphocytes. In what has been proposed to be the canonical mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the spike glycoprotein of binds to the host angiotensin-converting which it is [Hoffmann et al., 2020](#bib25)). tissues ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/84790/figures#fig1s1)), ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as in the kidney, testis, and small intestine ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/84790/figures#fig1s1)). Still, a wide variety of cell types are potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 ( [Codo et al., al., 2022](#bib50); [Yang et al., 2020](#bib70)), even though some of these cells express very low levels of ACE2. We showed that this is the case for lymphocytes ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/84790/figures#fig1s2)). These findings suggest that either SARS-CoV-2 uses alternative mechanisms to enter these cells or that auxiliary molecules at the plasma membrane may promote infection by stabilizing the virus until it interacts with ACE2. In agreement with the latter, binding of sCoV-2 to certain cell surface proteins facilitates viral entry ( [Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020](#bib8); [Cecon et al., 2022](#bib9)). Since the structures of the spike of SARS-CoV-1 (sCoV-1) and the sCoV-2 proteins are [Wrapp et al., 2020](#bib66); [Yuan et al., 2020](#bib71)), we used the P-HIPSTer algorithm to uncover human proteins that putatively interact with spike ( [Lasso et al., 2019](#bib32)). Seventy-one interact with sCoV-1 ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3](/articles/84790/figures#fig1s3)). We then cross-referenced the proteins with five databases of plasma membrane proteins to identify the ones located on the cell surface (see 'Methods' for details). CD4 was the only protein predicted to interact with sCoV-1 that appeared in all five databases ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3](/articles/84790/figures#fig1s3)). CD4 is expressed mainly in T helper lymphocytes and has been shown to be the co-receptor to HIV ( [Shaik et al., 2019](#bib51)). Since CD4+ lymphocytes 2014](#bib21); [O'Shea and Paul, 2010](#bib44)), T cells by SARS-CoV-2 could explain lymphocytopenia and dysregulated inflammatory response in severe COVID-19 patients. Moreover, from an evolutionary perspective, infection of CD4+ T cells represents an effective mechanism for viruses to escape the immune response ( [Xu et al., 2001](#bib69)). To test whether human primary T cells are infected by SARS-CoV-2, we purified CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood of noninfected healthy controls/donors (HC), incubated these cells with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hr, and washed them the three times with PBS. The viral load was measured 24 hr post infection. We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ ( [Figure 1A](#fig1) and [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A](/articles/84790/figures#fig1s4)). To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cells, we performed in situ hybridization using probes against the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, immunofluorescence for sCoV-2 using antibodies spike transmission electron microscopy ( [Figure 1B and C](#fig1)). In parallel, we infected cells with the VSV-mCherry-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus ( that SARS-CoV-2 infects CD4+ T cells. Notably, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA remains roughly stable until 48 hr post infection ( [Figure 1D](#fig1)). Of note, although most of the data presented here was generated using the ancient SARS-CoV-2 B lineage, CD4+ T cells were also infected by the P.1 (gamma) variant ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C](/articles/84790/figures#fig1s4)). Furthermore, we identified the presence of the negative strand (antisense) of SARS-CoV-2 in the infected cells ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4D](/articles/84790/figures#fig1s4)), demonstrating that the virus replicates in T helper cells. We also found by plaque assay analysis that SARS-CoV-2-infected CD4+ T cells release infectious viral particles, although much less efficiently than Vero cells (positive control) in vivo, we purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood cells of COVID-19 patients ( [Supplementary file 1](/articles/84790/figures#supp1)). Similar to our ex vivo experiments, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients ( [Figure 1F](#fig1)). available ( [Liao et al., 2020](#bib36)), we detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 2.1% of CD4+ T cells of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with severe COVID-19 ( [Figure 1F](#fig1) and [Figure 1\u2014figure demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infects CD4+ T cells. Next, we sought to explore the role of the CD4 molecule in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the putative interaction found using P-HIPSTer, we performed molecular docking analyses and predicted that sCoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) directly interacts with the N-terminal (NTD) and 1](/articles/84790/figures#fig2s1)). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with stepwise temperature increase were applied to challenge the kinetic stability of the docking model representatives ( [Figure 2B](#fig2)). Two models remained stable after the third step of simulation at 353 K and represent likely candidates for the interaction between the CD4 NTD and sCoV-2 RBD ( [Figure 2B](#fig2)). Additionally, we evaluated the dynamic behavior of closely related binding mode models present in the same cluster as these two models. We observed a strong structural convergence toward the putative model in one case, which indicates plausible and rather stable interaction between CD4 NTD and sCoV-2 RBD ( [Figure interaction region of RBD with CD4 is predicted to overlap with that of human ACE2 ( [Figure 2C and D](#fig2)). The interaction confirmed by physical CD4 (Kd = 22 nM) spike full length and CD4 (Kd = 27 nM). Considering the similar affinities, these results suggest that the interaction interface between sCoV-2 and CD4 occurs at the RBD ( [Figure 3B and C](#fig3)). Consistent with the hypothesis that CD4-sCoV-2 interaction is required for infection, we observed that pre-incubation with soluble CD4 (sCD4) completely blunted viral load in CD4+ T cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 ( [Figure 3D](#fig3)). Together, these data demonstrate CD4 molecule.

Moreover, we used human T cell lines that express CD4 (A3.01) or not higher levels of TMPRSS2 than primary CD4+ supplement 1](/articles/84790/figures#fig3s1)), the presence of CD4 was sufficient to increase viral load in A3.01 cells compared to A2.01 ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/84790/figures#fig3s1)). These results the VSV-mCherry-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype model ( [Figure 3F](#fig3)). Importantly, the load ( [Figure 3H and H](#fig3)). Our immunoprecipitation experiments indicated no physical interaction between CD4 and ACE2 (data not shown). Since CD4+ T cells have very low ACE2 expression, we tested whether CD4 alone was sufficient to allow SARS-CoV-2 entry. Inhibition using reduced SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate that ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD4 are all required to allow the infection of CD4+ T cells by SARS-CoV-2. To assess the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infecting CD4+ T cells, we performed mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics in CD4+ T cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection alters multiple housekeeping pathways associated with the immune system, infectious diseases, cell cycle, and cellular metabolism ( [Figure 4A and B](#fig4) exposure elicits alterations associated with 'cellular responses to stress,' which include changes in proteins involved in translation, mitochondrial metabolism, cytoskeleton remodeling, cellular vivo exposure of CD4+ T cells with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 10% reduction of cell viability 24 hr after infection with a low MOI (0.1) ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3](/articles/84790/figures#fig4s3)). SARS-CoV-2 may cause cell death by different mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 can induce apoptosis in different cell lines through stimulation of autophagy via inhibition of mTOR signaling ( [Li et al., 2021](#bib35)). It can also induce inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in primary monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients ( [Alvim et al., 2020](#bib2)). In epithelial respiratory and kidney cell lines, SARS-CoV drives multimodal necrosis ( [Yue et al., 2018](#bib72)). In lymphocytes, however, it has been demonstrated that apoptosis is the mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2-mediated cell death ( [Crunfli et al., 2022](#bib11)), which is in line with our proteomic data ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1 and 4\u2014source data 1 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/84790/elife-84790-fig4-data1-v1.zip](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/84790/elife-84790-fig4-data1-v1.zip) - Figure 4\u2014source data 2 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/84790/elife-84790-fig4-data2-v1.zip](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/84790/elife-84790-fig4-data2-v1.zip) - Figure 4\u2014source data 3 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/84790/elife-84790-fig4-data3-v1.zip](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/84790/elife-84790-fig4-data3-v1.zip) - Figure 4\u2014source data 4 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/84790/elife-84790-fig4-data4-v1.zip](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/84790/elife-84790-fig4-data4-v1.zip) The expression and release of IL-10 have been widely associated with chronic viral infections and determines viral persistence ( [Brooks et al., 2006](#bib6)). Noteworthy, increased serum levels of IL-10 are associated with COVID-19 severity ( [Han et al., 2020](#bib24); [Zhao et al., 2020](#bib74)). We found that IL-10 expression by CD4+ T cells was higher in BAL [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3](/articles/84790/figures#fig4s3)) and blood ( [Figure 4C](#fig4)) of severe COVID-19 patients. These changes were at least in part cell autonomous since purified CD4+ T cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 also expressed higher levels of IL-10 ( [Figure 4D](#fig4)). Due to the immunomodulatory role of IL-10, we measured the expression of key pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines involved in the immune response elicited by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells from severe COVID-19 patients had decreased expression of IFN and IL-17A in relation to cells from patients with the moderate form of the disease or healthy donors ( [Figure 4C](#fig4)). These results show that SARS-CoV-2 induces IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells, which is associated with suppression of genes that encode key pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN and IL-17A, and correlates with disease severity. The activation of the transcription factor CREB-1 via Ser133 phosphorylation induces IL-10 ( [Figure 4E](#fig4)). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a signaling cascade that culminates in the upregulation of IL-10 in CD4+ T cells. Altogether, our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infects CD4+ T cells, impairs cell function, leads to increased IL-10 expression, and compromises cell viability, which in turn dampens immunity against the virus and contributes to disease severity. Impaired innate and adaptive immunity is a hallmark of COVID-19, particularly in patients that progress to the critical stages of the disease ( [Hadjadj et al., 2020](#bib23); [Mathew et al., 2020](#bib42)). Here, we propose that the alterations in immune responses associated with severe COVID-19 are at least partially triggered by infection of CD4+ T helper cells by SARS-CoV-2 and consequent dysregulation of immune function. T helper cells are infected by SARS-CoV-2 using a mechanism that involves binding of sCoV-2 to CD4 and entry mediated by the canonical ACE2/TMPRSS2 pathway. We propose a model where CD4 stabilizes SARS-CoV-2 on the cell membrane until the virus encounters ACE2 to enter the cell. Moreover, Cecon and colleagues showed that CD4 co- expression with ACE2 in HEK293 cells decreases the affinity and the maximal binding between the sCoV-2 RBD and ACE2 ( [Cecon et al., 2022](#bib9)), which is in line with our MD results and the binding assays ( [Figure 3](#fig3)), suggesting an intricate mechanism of CoV-2 infection in CD4+ D](#fig2) and [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/84790/figures#fig2s1)). Taken together, these data indicate that in CD4-expressing cells direct binding of sCoV-2 to the CD4 molecule represents a potential mechanism to favor viral entry. Once in CD4+ T cells, SARS-CoV-2 leads to protein expression changes consistent with alterations in pathways related to stress response, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation, which, if sustained, culminate in cell dysfunction and may lead to cell death. SARS-CoV-2 also results in phosphorylation of CREB-1 transcription factor and induction of its target gene IL-10 in a cell-autonomous manner. IL-10 is a powerful anti-inflammatory cytokine and has been previously associated with viral persistence ( [Brooks et al., 2006](#bib6)). Serum levels of IL-10 increase during the early stages of the disease - when viral load reaches its peak - and may predict COVID-19 outcome ( [Han et al., 2020](#bib24); [Zhao et al., 2020](#bib74)). This increase occurs only in patients with the severe form of COVID-19 ( [Zhao et al., 2020](#bib74)). In contrast, we found IFN and IL-17A to be upregulated in CD4+ T cells of patients with moderate illness, indicating a protective role for these cytokines. However, in patients with severe illness, the expression of IFN and IL-17A in CD4+ T cells is dampened. IL-10 is a known suppressor of Th1 and Th17 responses and it is likely to contribute to the changes in IFN and IL-17A. These features will ultimately reflect in the quality of the immune response, which in combination with T cell death and consequent lymphopenia, may result in transient/acute immunodeficiency and impair adaptive immunity in severe COVID-19 patients ( [Arunachalam et al., 2020](#bib3); et al., 2020](#bib59)). is a characteristic feature of severe COVID-19 ( [Zheng et al., 2020](#bib75)). Here, we demonstrated that infected CD4+ T cells undergo cell death, which may contribute to the development of lymphocytopenia. In addition, cytokines such as IL-1 released by infected monocytes can promote T cell dysfunction ( [Codo et al., 2020](#bib10)). Therefore, the decrease in lymphocyte count may be attributed to both infected T cell death and dysfunctional T cells resulting from inflammatory cytokine storm. How long these alterations in T cell function persist in vivo and whether they have long-lasting impacts on adaptive immunity remains to be determined. Hence, avoiding T cell infection by blocking sCoV-2-CD4 interaction and boosting T cell resistance against SARS-CoV-2 might represent complementary therapeutic approaches to preserve immune response integrity and prevent patients from progressing to the severe stages of COVID-19. Methods Subjects The samples from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were obtained at the Clinical Hospital of the University of Campinas (SP-Brazil). Both COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects included in this work signed a term of consent approved by the University of Campinas Committee for Ethical Research (CAAE: 32078620.4.0000.5404; CAEE: 30227920.9.0000.5404). Human blood samples from severe COVID-19 patients analyzed in this study were obtained from individuals admitted at the Clinics Hospital, University of Campinas, and included in a clinical trial (UTN: U1111-1250-1843). In vitro experiments were performed with buffy coats from healthy blood donors provided by The Hematology and Hemotherapy Center of the University of Campinas (CAAE: 31622420.0.0000.5404). Diagnosis Nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage were tested for SARS-CoV- 2 by real-time qPCR. The tests were performed in the Laboratory of High-Performance Molecular Diagnostic or Laboratory of Clinical Pathology, all located at the University of Campinas. The samples were aliquoted and extracted manually using the MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems). Some RNAs were automatically isolated by MagMAX Express-96 Magnetic Particle Processor (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time qPCRs were performed in duplicates using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) for the detection of SarbecoV E-gene with specific primers reverse-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA, QSY. Patients positive for COVID-19 when Ct < 38. qPCRs were performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system. Blood sample collection and lymphocyte separation Each COVID-19 patient had heparin and plain blood tubes collected. Whole blood, serum, and plasma samples were separated. PBMCs from COVID-19 patients and buffy coats were obtained through the Histopaque-1077 density gradient (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were diluted in Hanks (1:1) and gently poured into 15 or 50 ml conical tubes containing 3 or 10 ml of Histopaque, respectively. Then, the samples were centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C without brake. The PBMC layer was collected into a new tube, lymphocytes were sorted (see below), and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C 5% CO2 and A2.01 (ARP-2059) cells were acquired from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program (MD) and maintained in RPMI contamination was not detected. A3.01 is a lymphoblastic leukemia cell line that expresses high levels of CD4, while A2.01 does not show detectable levels of CD4. The A2.04 was produced for this article. In brief, the coding sequence for CD4 was amplified from pCMV.CD4 and cloned into the BglII/SalI cloning site of pMSCV-IRES-GFP. The retrovirus carrying pMSCV-CD4-IRES-GFP vector was produced in Peak cells by using pVSV-G and pCL-Eco packing vectors as previously described ( [Tavares et al., [Tavares et al., 1986](#bib20)) were transduced with this retrovirus and sorted for GFP positive in the BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer in the Ribeir\u00e3o Preto Center for Cell-Based Therapy/Hemotherapy, and the confirmation for CD4 expression was done by western blot and flow cytometry. Virus and infection The ancient SARS-CoV-2 viral lineage [CoV-2(B)] was isolated from the second confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil and kindly donated by Prof. Dr. Edson Luiz Durigon The variant [CoV-2(P.1)] was isolated from residual nasopharyngeal lavage specimens of a patient from Manaus City, Brazil, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (GISAID accession ID EPI_ISL_1708318). SARS-CoV-2 virus stocks were propagated in Vero cell line CCL-81 (STR profiling authentication method, mycoplasma contamination not detected, origin: ATCC) and supernatant was harvested at 2 dpi. The viral titers were determined by plaque assays on Vero cells. Vero cells were propagated atmosphere. Cells were incubated with the CoV-2(B) or CoV-2(P.1) lineage (MOI = 1 unless indicated otherwise) for 1 hr at room temperature. After viral adsorption, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with a culture medium under standard culture conditions (37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 atmosphere). Most of the in vitro experiments were done with 1 million sorted CD3+CD4+ live cells plated over a well of a 48-well plate. For proteomic and immunoblotting experiments, 4 million live CD3+CD4+ cells were used. All experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were done in a biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL-3) located in the Institute of Biology from the University Campinas. Flow cytometry CD4+ T cells were sorted with FACSJazz or FACS Melody (BD Biosciences) as CD4+CD3+ and, in some experiments, CD8-CD3+. CD8+ T cells were sorted as CD8+CD3+ or CD4+CD3+ (see the list of antibodies in [Supplementary file 3](/articles/84790/figures#supp3)). We performed flow cytometry with a Lin CD14, CD16, CD19, and CD56 5% CO2 atmosphere for infection. All flow cytometry analyses were performed in FACS Symphony A5 (BD Biosciences). All antibodies used in the present study were sodium azide free. Biotinylated DNA probe synthesis Probe synthesis is based on two PCR steps both using the same pair of primers (primer sense: AACACGCAAATTAATGCCTGTCTG; primer antisense: GTAACAGCATCAGGTGAAGAAACA) for The amplifying PCR mix contains 1\u00d7 buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.1 \u00b5M of each primer, 1 \u00b5l of cDNA (1:10), and 1.5 U Taq polymerase (GoTaq DNA Polymerase, Promega) in a final volume of 50 \u00b5l. The reaction was subjected to 35 cycles of PCR including denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s, following incubation at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in order to verify a final amplicon of 300 pb. The second PCR contained slight modifications in relation to the first, that is, we used 0.2 mM of d (C, G, A) TP and 0.2 \u00b5M of 16-dUTP instead of the regular dNTP mix, and used 1 \u00b5l of the previous PCR as a template ( [Day et al., 1990](#bib13)). Plaque assays Vero cells in 24-well plates up to 80% confluency. Supernatant samples from infected were added and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for an hour for virus adsorption. Samples were replaced with a semi-solid overlay medium (1% w/v carboxy methyl cellulose in 37\u00b0C with 5% of CO2 (PFA), stained in 1% w/v methylene blue, results were expressed as viral plaque-forming units per milliliter of sample (PFU/ml).

Briefly, 100 \u00b5g of magnetic bead was washed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and then incubated with 10 \u00b5g anti-CD4 antibody for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C with mixing. For complex formation, we co-incubated 60 pmoles of recombinant CD4 (Cat# 60 pmoles of Spike S1 Twin-Strep-Tag recombinant protein expressed and generously provided by Dr. Leda Castilho from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( [Alvim et al., 2020](#bib2)). Incubation was performed in 300 l of PBS and kept overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle agitation. After incubation, the recombinant protein solution was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube with the washed immobilized beads and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. The complex was precipitated and proteins that did not bind to the beads were subsequently removed during the washes. The protein was eluted from the bead using Laemmli buffer and heat (95\u00b0 for 5 min). The sample was analyzed by affinity blot using a streptavidin-HRP detection (Cat# 405210, BioLegend). Full-range Rainbow (Cat# RPN800E) was used as the molecular weight marker. Spike target prediction The P-HIPSTER database ( [http://phipster.org](http://phipster.org); last accessed: June 1, 2020) was used to find potential SARS-CoV-2 spike-human interactions. P-HIPSTER discoveries are predicted using protein similarities of known interactions ( [Lasso et al., 2019](#bib32)). Only interactions with a final likelihood ratio (LR) score 100 were used in the analysis. According to the authors, this threshold has a validation rate of 76%. To evaluate whether these proteins were found on the cellular membrane, four databases were used. The Human Protein Atlas ( [https://www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org); last accessed: June 1, 2020) contains tissue and anatomical protein annotations; 1917 proteins classified as 'Cell Membrane' were retrieved. Panther GO is a gene set enrichment analysis tool (Mi H, PANTHER version 14: More genomes, a new PANTHER GO-slim and in enrichment analysis tools); 1504 genes annotated as 'integral ;last 2020) is a app that integrates various enrichment analysis tools ( [Kuleshov et al., 2016](#bib29)), which library was used to retrieve JENSEN compartment annotations ( [https://compartments.jensenlab.org/](https://compartments.jensenlab.org/); last accessed: June 1, 2020) 'plasma membrane' (1148), and surface' (715). To common datasets generate the Venn diagram, jvenn ( [http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/](http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/); last accessed: June 1, 2020) was used ( [Bardou et al., 2014](#bib4)). Gene set enrichment analysis EnrichR was used for enrichment analysis for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein predicted interactions. GO Molecular Function data was downloaded, and enrichments with an adjusted p-value<0.05 were retrieved. Global expression analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD4 To evaluate which tissues and cells express ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD4, expression data (both protein and consensus mRNA expression, NX) from The Human Protein Atlas ( [https://www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org); accessed: 7, 2020) 7, 2020) ( [Wu et al., 2016](#bib68)) were downloaded and plotted. In The Human Protein Atlas data, only normalized expression level 1 and protein detection 'low' of at least one of the three genes was plotted. In the BioGPS data, this threshold was 10 a.u. (arbitrary units). sCoV-2-ACE2-interacting peptide (ACE2) design and synthesis A peptide representing the interacting region of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with ACE2 and present at the receptor binding domain (RBD receptor binding doming) was designed based on the tridimensional structure described elsewhere ( [Shang et al., 2020](#bib52)). Based on the structure, we selected an unstructured and continuous segment of 16 amino acid residues (THR487-GLY502), which contained most of the interaction points with ACE2. We added to the segment a substitution of CYS488 to SER, which intended to avoid random disulfide bond formation and structural alterations, keeping the same hydrophilicity in the interacting region. An amidated CYS residue was added at the C-terminal of the peptide to allow simple and specific conjugation with accessory detection molecules. The complete 17 amino acid residues (487NCYFPLQSYGFQPTNG502C) were synthesized using standard FMOC solid-phase peptide synthesis chemistry as previously described ( [Fields and Noble, 1990](#bib18)) at a 100 \u00b5M resin (Advanced ChemTech, Cat# SA5130). All FMOC-aas (Advanced ChemTech) were used with 2.5 excess. FMOC-aa coupling reaction assisted by six cycles of 2 min in a home-made microwave device. At the end of coupling reactions, the peptide was cleaved from the resin using a solution of trifluoroacetic acid solution, 4% water, 4% triisopropylsilane, mg 2 hr. Cleaved peptide was precipitated with ethylbutylether and then purified on C18 seppack solid phase extraction cartridges (10 mg, Sigma-Aldrich) using a water:acetonitrile solvent system. Proteomic analysis Infected and mock cells were resuspended in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1% Triton freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Sigma). After three cycles of 30 s of ultra-sonication for cell lysis, the protein amount was quantified by the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Aiming to obtain a higher yield, we performed the FASP protocol for subsequent analyses ( [Distler et al., 2016](#bib16)). The FASP protocol is a method that allows to concentrate proteins and clean up the samples through washing steps in a microcolumn tip with a 10 kDa MW cut off and perform the tryptic digestion in this column. Also, 10 g of protein were used to carry out the FASP protocol, where the samples were reduced, alkylated, and later digested using trypsin. An amount of 100 fmol/l of digestion products of Enolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was added to each sample as internal standard, then separation of tryptic peptides was performed on an ACQUITY MClass System (Waters Corporation). Then, 1 \u00b5g of each digested samples was loaded onto a Symmetry C18 5 m, 180 m \u00d7 20 mm precolumn (Waters Corporation) and subsequently separated by a 120 min reversed phase gradient at 300 nl/min (linear gradient, 2-85% CH3CN over 90 min) using a HSS T3 C18 1.8 m, 75 m \u00d7 150 mm nanoscale LC column (Waters Corporation) maintained at 40\u00b0C. After peptide separation, the ionized peptides were acquired by a Synapt G2-Si (Waters Corporation). Differential protein expression was evaluated with data-independent acquisition (DIA) of shotgun proteomics analysis by Expression configuration mode using the Ion Mobility cell (HDMSe). All spectra have been acquired in Ion Mobility Mode by applying a wave velocity for the ion separation of 800 m/s and a transfer wave velocity of 175 m/s. The mass spectrometer operated in 'Expression Mode,' switching between low (4 eV) and high (25-60 eV) collision energies on the gas cell, using a scan time of 0.5 s per function over 50-2000 m/z. The processing through low and elevated energy, added to the data of the reference lock mass ([Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B Standard, Waters Corporation) provides a time-aligned inventory of accurate mass-retention time components for both low and elevated-energy (exact mass retention time [EMRT]). Each sample was analyzed in four technical replicates. Continuum LC-MS data from three replicate experiments for each sample was processed for qualitative and quantitative analysis using the software Progenesis QC for Proteomics (PLGS, Waters Corporation). The qualitative identification of proteins was obtained by searching in the Homo sapiens database (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Protein reviewed 2020). The expression analysis was performed considering technical replicates available for each experimental condition following the hypothesis that each group is an independent variable. Protein identifications were based on the detection of more than two fragment ions per peptide, and more than two peptides measured per protein. The list of normalized proteins was screened according to the following criteria: protein identified in at least 70% of the runs from the same sample and only modulated proteins with a p<0.05 were considered significant. Raw data are available in ProteomeXchange database under accession number PXD020967. In situ hybridization Sorted CD4+ T cells were incubated for 24 hr with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (MOI of 1) or mock. After 24 hr, the cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, at room temperature, followed by two washes with PBS (pH 7.4) prepared with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. Further, the cells were seeded on silanized glass slides and kept on a prewarmed surface until liquid is fully evaporated. The slides were washed with PBS and pretreated with 2% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min to bleach auto- and avoid nonspecific fluorescence. They were then washed twice with PBS 0.05% Triton X-100 (PBST), treated with Proteinase K (10 \u00b5g/ml) for 2 min, followed by PBST-Glycin (2 mg/ml) for 10 min, and a second fixation step with PFA 4% for 10 min, followed by three more washes with PBST at room temperature. Each sample was pre-hybridized with pH 7.0, and 100 \u00b5g salmon DNA), without the probe, for at least 2 hr at 37\u00b0C in a humid box. Samples were then incubated with Hyb containing the biotinylated probe (100 \u00b5l of the probe in 500 \u00b5l of Hyb), pre-denaturated (85\u00b0C for 10 min), in a humid box overnight at 37\u00b0C. The slides were then subjected to sequential washes with 50% Hyb in 2\u00d7 SSC and in 2\u00d7 SSC, for 20 min at 37\u00b0C each, and two washes for 10 min each with 2\u00d7 SSC, 0.2\u00d7 SSC, and 1:300) for 2 hr at room temperature in the humid box protected from light. The slides were washed with PBST, incubated with DAPI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-3598), diluted 1:1000 in PBST for 5 min at room temperature, protected from light, and mounted in an aqueous mounting solution for confocal imaging. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antisense cDNA was generated using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, 60 ng of RNA were incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min with 1\u00d7 annealing buffer and 250 nM of a primer complementary to the anti-sense CoV-2 strand containing a nonviral tag at the 5 end. The sample was chilled at 4\u00b0C for 1 min and incubated at 55\u00b0C for 50 min with SuperScript III/RNaseOUT and 1\u00d7 master mix for reverse transcription (RT). The sample was heated to 85\u00b0C for enzyme inactivation. The antisense strand was amplified in a PCR using 100 nM of primers complementary to the nonviral tag and to the antisense CoV-2 strand. As a control for false-priming ( [Bessaud et al., 2008](#bib5)), we performed the RT without the tagged reverse primer and a PCR using both the RT and the PCR primers at 100 nM. The sense strand was also amplified as a control with the same method using nontagged primers for the RT and PCR. The samples were loaded in a 4% agarose gel in Tris/borate/EDTA buffer containing 1\u00d7 SybrSafe (Thermo Fisher). Immunoblotting Cells were infected for 3 hr with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (MOI of 1) or mock, washed with PBS, and the protein was extracted using lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 100 mM pH Protein quantification was performed using Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, 5 \u00b5g protein of each sample was diluted with Laemmli buffer and heated at 95\u00b0C during 5 min. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF were blocked with StartingBlock (37539, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min, and incubated during 1 rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cat# RPN4301, GE Healthcare, diluted 1:10,000 in block buffer). Membranes were then washed and Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Cat# WBKLS0500, Millipore), and the 1:5000) antibodies as loading controls. Quantification was performed using ImageJ. Immunofluorescence Cells were prepared onto silanized glass slides as previously described for in situ hybridization ( [Alamri et al., 2017](#bib1)), followed by a washing step using PBST 0.1 M pH 7.4. To avoid autofluorescence, the cells were treated with 2% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min, washed with PBST, and treated with 0.1 M glycine in PBST for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were then washed and treated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution in PBST for 30 min (according to the manufacturer's suggestion), to block nonspecific epitopes. Cells and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humid box. The slides were then washed and incubated with anti-human IgG Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher, A11013) diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA solution in PBST for 2 hr at room temperature in a humid box, protected from light. The samples were washed again, incubated with DAPI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-3598) diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA solution in PBST for 5 min at room temperature protected from light, and mounted in an aqueous mounting solution for confocal imaging. Microscopy images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan on an Axio Observer 7 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) with a C Plan-Apochromat \u00d763/1.4 Oil DIC objective, 4\u00d7 optical zoom. Prior to image analysis, raw .czi files were automatically processed into deconvoluted Airyscan images using the Zen Black 2.3 software. For DAPI, conventional confocal images were acquired using a 405 nm laser line for excitation and a pinhole set to 1 AU. Transmission electron microscopy T lymphocyte cell cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 \u00d7 g for 10 min. Cell culture supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of the fixative solution, which consisted of 1 M sodium cacodylate aqueous solution supplemented with 2.5 % v/v glutaraldehyde and 3 mM calcium chloride at pH 7.2, and kept overnight (16 hr) at 4\u00b0C. Cells were pelleted (1500 rpm for 2 min) and washed in cacodylate buffer with calcium chloride for a total of five times. Post-fixation was performed with 1% reduced osmium tetroxide plus 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide in a cacodylate buffer with calcium chloride for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C covered from light. Pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 1500 rpm at 4\u00b0C and washed three times in ddH2O for 2 min. Cells were resuspended in 4% low melting agarose (approximately 50\u00b0C) and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 30\u00b0C and kept 20 min on ice for solidification. Agarose pellets were trimmed in small blocks and stained for contrast enhancement with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate overnight at 4\u00b0C. Later, samples were washed in ddH2O and dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol (20, 50, 70, 80, 90, 100% twice), 1:1 ethanol:acetone, and acetone (twice), 20 min each. Samples were embedded in Embed-812 (Electron Microscopy Science, USA, #14120) following manufacturer's recommendations. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were mounted in 200 mesh copper grids and stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and imaged in a JEOL JEM-1400 Transmission Electron Microscope (120 kV accelerating voltage) and/or Helios Nanolab Dualbeam 660 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (30 kV accelerating voltage) at the Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Brazilian Nanotechnology National Laboratory, LNNano, CNPEM. RNA extraction cDNA synthesis Total RNA was extracted from samples using TRI Reagent (Sigma) (200 \u00b5l per pellet of cells) according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified using NanoDrop 200 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). cDNA was synthesized using 500 ng of total RNA and the GoScript Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Promega) or the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA final concentration was Expression levels of each gene were normalized to a housekeeping gene (i.e., hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 [HPRT1]). qPCR reaction was performed using 15 cDNA, of specific primers, Amplification occurred upon cycling conditions: 95\u00b0C for 3 min and 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 20 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. Amplification plots, melting curves, and Ct values were obtained using CFX Manager (Bio-Rad). Gene expression fold change was calculated with the Ct method ( [Supplementary file 4](/articles/84790/figures#supp4)). Viral load was determined specific SARS-CoV-2 N1 primers, as described previously ( [Won specific SarbecoV E-gene primers and probe. For the preparation of a standard curve, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 were used. qPCR was performed using the Bio-Rad CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System and Thermo Fisher QuantStudio 3. Relative expression of the viral envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes from in vitro CD3+CD4+ cells were detected using GeneFinder COVID-19 Plus RealAmpKit (OSANG Healthcare Co). Expression level of each gene was normalized to internal control of the kit and relative gene expression was calculated as 2- CT. For this kit, the qPCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 data from six samples of BALF-containing immune cells of severe COVID-19 patients (C145, C146, C148, C149, and C152) by downloading the respective single-cell processed data matrices from GEO under the accession number GSE145926. The number of viral transcripts mapped to SARS-CoV-2 was previously integrated by their authors as an additional feature into data matrices called 'NcoV' used to quantify the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. The data matrices were then imported to R version 3.6.3 and analyzed using Seurat v3.1 ( [Stuart et al., 2019](#bib56)). A quality control filtering was applied to remove low-quality cells considering a gene number between 200 and 6000, unique molecular identifier (UMI) count > 1000, and mitochondrial gene percentage <0.1. After the filtering step, a total of 37,197 cells and 25,722 features (including SARS-CoV-2 viral load) were left for downstream analysis. The filtered gene-barcode matrix of all samples was integrated with FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions considering the first 50 dimensions of canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Then, the filtered data matrix was normalized using the 'LogNormalize' method in Seurat with a scale factor of 10,000. The top 3000 variable genes were then identified using the 'vst' method in Seurat using the FindVariableFeatures function. Variables 'nCount_RNA' and 'percent.mito' were regressed out in the scaling step, and principal component analysis was performed using the top 3000 variable genes using 100 dimensions. Then, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding were performed on the top 40 principal components for visualizing the cells. Additionally, a clustering analysis was performed on the first 40 principal components using a resolution of 0.8. Then, differential gene expression analysis was performed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test using the FindAllMarkers function to obtain a list of representative gene markers for each cluster of cells. Representative gene markers were considered based on adjusted p-value<0.05 and average log fold change > 0.25 among cells. T cell cluster annotation was performed using an evidence-based score approach with scCATCH ( [Shao et al., 2020](#bib53)) based on differential gene markers list. Finally, CD4+ T cell subpopulations were annotated considering a high differential expression of CD4, and IL32 gene markers ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5](/articles/84790/figures#fig1s5)). Based on the methodology applied above, a total of 1846 single cells were identified as CD4+ T cells. T cells were considered infected assuming a threshold with at least 10% of viral RNA expression. The applied threshold resulted in 39 single cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Docking The RosettaDock4.0 protein docking protocol ( [Leman et al., 2020](#bib33); [Marze et al., 2018](#bib41)) was applied to model the interaction between CD4 NTD ( [Wu et 6lzg, residues 333-527) as described previously. Briefly, the first step consisted of generating an ensemble of 100 conformers for each target. The two-stage automated Rosetta docking protocol simulates the physical encounter of the proteins and maximizes interactions, which may lead to binding. In the first stage (global docking), a rigid-body translation-rotation of one of the protein samples' possible interaction modes using a low-resolution, centroid-based representation of the side chains. RosettaDock4.0 also mimics binding-induced conformational adaptations by assessing a pre-generated list of conformers. This is an important feature for cases where backbone perturbation is inherent to the interface of interaction. Additionally, a score term named Motif Dock Score ranks low-resolution models according to their chance to generate promising high-resolution models, reducing the number of candidates to proceed to the next stage. In the second stage (local docking), the centroid mode is converted into full-atom representation, where small random rigid-body perturbations take place, followed by side-chain relaxation that aims to optimize local interactions. A first set of models consisted of generating 10,000 low-resolution candidates using global docking with 3 \u00c5 translation and 8\u00b0 rotation perturbation parameters. The 2000 highest-ranked models according to Motif Dock Score proceeded to the local docking stage using default parameters (0.1 \u00c5 translation and 3\u00b0 rotation perturbation parameters). Twenty-five high-resolution candidates were generated for each low-resolution input model totaling 50,000 models. A second set of models was generated by first randomizing CD4 NTD orientation previously to docking run. For this strategy, 40,000 low-resolution and 300,000 high-resolution models were generated similarly to the description above. As an alternative docking approach, monomeric chains were also docked using the HADDOCK 2.4 server ( [van Zundert et al., 2016](#bib61)), which returned 40 model candidates spread into 13 clusters. A total of 800 additional models were generated using these models as input to the high-resolution docking stage at RosettaDock4.0. Next, best-ranked 2000 models according to interface score (I_sc) were fully relaxed with Relax application (beta_genpot score function, Rosetta Package) and evaluated with InterfaceAnalyzer application (Rosetta package) to extract interface metrics. A total of 500 top-ranked models according to interface binding energy (dG_separated) were evaluated for pairwise structural similarity with LovoAlign ( [Mart\u00ednez et al., 2007](#bib40)) and were clustered at 2.0 \u00c5 radius. Best-ranked models of each of the first 50 clusters were selected for MD simulation. This set of models is available at [https://github.com/ajrferrari/CD4-RBD-interaction-models](https://github.com/ajrferrari/CD4-RBD-interaction-models) (copy archived at [Ferrari, 2023](#bib17)). Molecular dynamics simulations MD simulations have been used to discriminate among protein complexes decoys by challenging their thermal stability ( [Radom et al., 2018](#bib47)). All-atom MD simulations were carried out with pmemd within AMBER20 software suite for 50 representative models of CD4 NTD sCov2 RBD interaction obtained as al., 2020](#bib65)) was built using the Glycam web server. Each system was solvated in a periodic octahedral water box such that the initial structure was more than 24 \u00c5 of its closest image. Neutralizing ions (Na+ and Cl-) were added to a final concentration of 0.15 M ( [Machado and Pantano, 2020](#bib38)). The ff14SB force field ( [Maier et al., 2015](#bib39)) was used for modeling proteins, the GLYCAM06 force field ( [Kirschner et al., 2008](#bib28)) for modeling the glycan, and water was described with the TIP3P model ( [Jorgensen et al., 1983](#bib27)). Electrostatic interactions using Mesh Ewald ( [Darden et al., 1998](#bib12)), nonbonded interactions were truncated at 9 \u00c5, bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained at their equilibrium values, and a time step of 2 fs was used for the numerical integration of the equations of motion. Before production runs, all systems were equilibrated in five sequential steps: (1) 2500 steps of steepest descent line minimization followed by 2500 of conjugate gradient minimization; (2) 1 ns simulation at 303 K in the NVT ensemble with harmonic restraints of 10 kcal mol-1 \u00c5-2 to protein and glycan atoms; (3) 1 ns simulation at 303 K in the NPT ensemble with harmonic restraints of 10 kcal mol-1 \u00c5-2 to protein and glycan atoms; (4) 1 ns simulation at 303 K in the NPT ensemble with harmonic restraints of 10 kcal mol-1 \u00c5-2 to protein backbone atoms; and (5) 1 ns simulation at 303 K in the NPT ensemble without restraints. Subsequently, production runs for assessment of the kinetic stability of the proposed structural models ( [Radom et al., 2018](#bib47)) were performed in the NPT ensemble in four sequential steps: (1) 50 ns simulation at 303 K; (2) 50 ns simulation at 323 K; (3) 50 ns simulation at 353 K; and (4) 50 ns simulation at 383 K. At each production step, models were evaluated according to their root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) to the initial model such that models with RMSD > 4 \u00c5 did not proceed to the next step. The 4 \u00c5 threshold was rationalized based on the fluctuations observed in the MD simulations on the sCov2 RBD and CD4 monomers independently. These simulations revealed that both monomers exhibited fluctuations ranging between 2 \u00c5 and 4 \u00c5 when evaluated up to 323 K ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/84790/figures#fig2s1)). Additionally, for the data contained in [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/84790/figures#fig2s1), triplicate production runs were performed for 100 ns at 303 K in the NPT ensemble. All trajectory analyses were performed with CPPTRAJ ( [Roe and Cheatham, 2013](#bib49)). Model structural visualization and image rendering were performed either in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, ACE2 (GenScript), and purified human thyroid receptor (TR) (negative control) proteins were labeled with FITC by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate probe, at molar ratio 3 FITC:1 protein, 4\u00b0C for 3 hr. The probe excess was removed by a desalting column (HiTrap 5 ml, GE) in a buffer containing 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl, pH of 7.4. To evaluate the affinities between RBD and CD4, TR or ACE2, serial dilutions of RBD (0.01-10 M) were performed. To evaluate the affinity between Spike full length (LECC/UFRJ LM220720) and CD4, serial dilutions of Spike (0.01-4.5 M) performed. The anisotropy curves were assembled in 0three replicates in black 384-well plates (Greiner). After serial dilution setup, each point was incubated with 20 nM of the labeled proteins (CD4, ACE2, or TR) for at least 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. For each fluorescence curve, the mixtures were submitted to fluorescence anisotropy measurements using ClarioStar plate reader (BMG, using polarization filters of 520 nm for emission and of 495 nm for excitation). Data analysis was performed using OriginPro 8.6 software, and dissociation constant (Kd) was obtained from data fitted to binding curves through Hill model.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: Comments and suggestions: 1. A weakness of the paper is the reference citations. Please be consistent in maintaining the citation style and numbering in the manuscript. 2. Although the extended Figure 9 suggests the expression of a multitude panel of gene expression, including apoptotic genes, the authors could not provide a piece of direct evidence to show how CD4 T cell death happens. What is the underlying mechanism of cell death? Is it by necrosis or apoptosis or pyroptosis? Please discuss. 3. Some previous studies suggested that lymphocytopenia in COVID infection could be due to impaired T cell proliferation or extravasation of T cells into tissue. The exact mechanism for lymphocytopenia should be discussed. 4. The data on CREB-1 Ser 133 in Figure 4E is not sufficiently convincing. It is difficult to understand what is the difference between every three lanes within mock and SARS CoV-2 infection. There is a pCREB band in lane 5 (2nd lane of CoV-2), but not in the other two. Please clarify. 5. Please add more specific information on the Insitu hybridization method. What is PK in the Insitu hybridization method? '...a couple of more washes'.

It is interesting from a computational biology perspective that if GO database is removed (too unvalidated), and \"Cell surface\" component of the Jensen database (considering its more dedicated \"Plasma membrane\" and \"External side of plasma membrane\" components considered in the work) out of the Venn diagram (Extended Data Figure 3), then what will be left is more interaction partners shared between the remaining 3 databases. Interestingly, these additional partners would include CD8A and CD8B. However, the authors show that the interaction was experimentally noted to happen with CD4+ T cells but not with CD8+ ones. This warrants some discussion on why this might be the case. Moreover, what would be the computational docking/MD results if the authors were to attempt modelling an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and CD8?

The 4 \u00c5 cutoff for the temperature gradient-based structural stability check sounds reasonable, but would be more justifiable if the authors would also present a histogram of all RMSDs (of final aberrations) for all the tried models and show how outlying the 4 \u00c5 is in the whole distribution, additionally attributing a p-value on the selected cutoff. 16. \"Methods\" section, \"Target selection\" subsection.

A weakness of the paper is the reference citations. Please be consistent in maintaining the citation style and numbering in the manuscript. We have edited the references according to the eLife citation style. 2. Although the extended Figure 9 suggests the expression of a multitude panel of gene expression, including apoptotic genes, the authors could not provide a piece of direct evidence to show how CD4 T cell death happens. What is the underlying mechanism of cell death? Is it by necrosis or apoptosis or pyroptosis? Please discuss. We would like to thank the Reviewer for the question, which gave us the opportunity to review the text and include a discussion about this topic in the paper. Please see sentences between lines 240 and 246. SARS-CoV-2 can induce cell death by different mechanisms, depending on the infected cell type and the microenvironment and inflammatory condition where these cells are inserted. For example, SARS-CoV-2 can induce apoptosis in different cell lines through stimulation of autophagy via suppression of mTOR signaling (DOI: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2021.166260). SARS-CoV-2 can also induce inflammasome activation and cell death by pyroptosis in primary monocytes and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients Immunomodulatory inhibit inflammasome pathways impair in monocytes and other cell types (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abo5400) and may have beneficial effects to the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 drives multimodal necrosis in epithelial respiratory and kidney cell lines by a mechanism dependent on Open Reading Frame-3a of the virus (doi:10.1038/s414190180917y) and it is able to induce PANoptosis by a mechanism dependent on ISG production, such as Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), in a context of cytokine storm and IFN-I treatment (10.1126/sciimmunol.abo6294). Thus, cell death induced by SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Interestingly and in line with this idea, proinflammatory cytokines produced by SARS-CoV-2-infected apoptotic cells inhibit the expression of efferocytic receptors and impairs the continual process of clearance of dying cells by macrophages (DOI: 10.7554/eLife.74443). In the present paper, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and induce cell death of CD4 T cells. Although the mechanisms of cell death have not been explored in depth in this article, data in the literature suggests that apoptosis is the mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2-infected T cell death (DOI: 10.1093/jmcb/mjac021). 3. Some previous studies suggested that lymphocytopenia in COVID infection could be due to impaired T cell proliferation or extravasation of T cells into tissue. The exact mechanism for lymphocytopenia should be discussed. Lymphocytopenia is a common characteristic of COVID-19 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-0148-4). The decrease of the number of circulating lymphocytes might be due to innumerous factors, such as cell death, migration into the inflamed tissue as well as by promoting systemic inflammation and direct neutralization in human spleen and lymph nodes ( [https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.661052](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.661052)). Single-cell analysis demonstrated that lymphocytes are not the main infiltrated cell population in the infected tissue (see figure 1E). Hence, it is likely that the decrease in lymphocyte count is attributed to both infected T cell death and dysfunctional T cells resulting from the inflammatory cytokine storm. This discussion has been incorporated into the manuscript. 4. The data on CREB-1 Ser 133 in Figure 4E is not sufficiently convincing. It is difficult to understand what is the difference between every three lanes within mock and SARS CoV-2 infection. There is a pCREB band in lane 5 (2nd lane of CoV-2), but not in the other two. Please clarify. Each lane in the western blotting experiment represents a different sample and each group were done in triplicate (see [Author response image 1](#sa2fig1)). Hence, a combination of experimental and biological variability, which is common when using human samples, explains the differences between the lanes, particularly in the 5th lane of pCREB. 5. Please add more specific information on the Insitu hybridization method. What is PK in the Insitu hybridization method? '...a couple of more washes'. Please be specific on experimental details. PK is an abbreviation for Proteinase K (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/BR/pt/product/mm/124568) used in the antigen retrieval step by digesting mRNA bound proteins that could prevent the DNA probes to hybridize to their target mRNA. As for the wash steps after fixation with 4% PFA, three washes were performed to remove possible fixative residues. More specific information was added to the manuscript. 6. Detection of antisense strand: Any reason to use 4% agarose gel? Is it due to the difficulty to detect the smaller size of the amplicon? The 4% agarose gel was employed in this protocol to attain the necessary resolution for discriminating between the sense and antisense strands based on their size difference. The difference in size between the two strands is only 21 nucleotides, which is caused by the non-viral tag present in the antisense strand. To effectively separate the small DNA fragments, a higher percentage agarose gel was required as it provides better resolution. 7. Immunoblotting: More experimental details are required. How many cells were infected or what is the total number of cells started with to get MOI=1? What is the exact time point used in Figure 4. E? Most of the experiments were done with one million sorted CD3+CD4+ live cells plated over a well of a 48-well plate. For proteomic and immunoblotting experiments, four million live CD3+CD4+ cells were used. All experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were done in a biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL-3) located in the Institute of Biology from the University Campinas. This information was clarified in the text. 8. Immunofluorescence: Normally immunofluorescence protocol suggests 5% BSA for blocking. Is there any specific reason to use 1% BSA for blocking? Percentage of BSA for blocking in immunofluorescence usually varies from 1-5%. We used different concentrations and decided to follow the manufacturer's suggestion (https://www.abcam.com/protocols/immunocytochemistry-immunofluorescence-protocol). 9. Transmission electron microscopy: More details on cacodylate buffer with calcium chloride in terms of concentration/molarity. We added the following sentence to the manuscript: \"T lymphocyte cell cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 min. Cell culture supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of the fixative solution, which consisted of 1 M sodium cacodylate aqueous solution supplemented with 2.5% v/v glutaraldehyde and 3 mM calcium chloride at pH 7.2, and kept overnight (16h) at 4\u00b0C\". 10. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis: Please specify the sample volumes used for extracting the RNA. Specify the quantity of total RNA or cDNA used for qRT PCR. We included more information in the text regarding the methods for RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Briefly, pelleted cells were resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of TRI Reagent and the RNA extraction performed following the manufacturer's instructions. 500 ng of RNA was converted into cDNA. The cDNA final concentration was 25 ng/L and qPCR reaction was performed using 15 ng of cDNA. 11. What is the housekeeping gene HPRT? Please expand it. The HPRT is a gene that encodes the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 protein, an enzyme responsible for recycling purines (purine salvage pathway) in DNA molecules. This enzyme catalyzes conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate phosphoribose from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). This gene is present in all somatic cells and is considered a housekeeping gene because GTP is necessary for DNA synthesis and cellular energy. For lymphocytes, especially in non-activated conditions, HPRT has shown to be a reliable housekeeping gene (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35645343/). 12. Please watch the abbreviations and provide the expanded version wherever required. For example Single-cell mRNA seq: What is CCA? What is PCA? We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. Abbreviations were defined as they appeared for the first time. 13. It is interesting from a computational biology perspective that if GO database is removed (too unvalidated), and \"Cell surface\" component of the Jensen database (considering its more dedicated \"Plasma membrane\" and \"External side of plasma membrane\" components considered in the work) out of the Venn diagram (Extended Data Figure 3), then what will be left is more interaction partners shared between the remaining 3 databases. Interestingly, these additional partners would include CD8A and CD8B. However, the authors show that the interaction was experimentally noted to happen with CD4+ T cells but not with CD8+ ones. This warrants some discussion on why this might be the case. Moreover, what would be the computational docking/MD results if the authors were to attempt modelling an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and CD8? Would they not arrive at stable complexes with the MD workflow and 4 \u00c5 cutoff for temperature-induced stability scrutinization, that would be extra validation and weight on the adopted computational scheme for the discovery. Although the Reviewer raises an interesting observation, our experiments beyond the computational prediction do not support a role for CD8 in T lymphocyte infection. Hence, we decided not to focus on a potential interaction between CD8 and SARS-CoV spike protein, although this does not exclude that the interaction may exist. Indeed, a highly stable interaction between Spike and CD8 molecules could result in a 'stable' complex that would trap the viral particles outside the cell precluding infection. This would be consistent with T CD8 cells not being infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, we would need more experiments to prove this mechanism and this is beyond the scope of this manuscript, which focuses on the interaction between spike and CD4 and its role in CD4 T cell infection. 14. Looking at the last complex in Figure 2, where the full-length sCov2 is recovered on top of the modelled fragment, one can see some additional interaction points or potential clashes with CD4 NTD. Were some of the models discarded on the ground of the orientation between CD4 NTD and sCov2 RBD being incompatible with the full length sCov2 due to possible steric clashes? We appreciate the Reviewer's observation regarding the potential clashes between CD4 NTD and the full-length sCov2 in the last complex presented in Figure 2. In constructing the full model, we initially performed a superposition of the RBD domain onto the full-length sCov2. The primary criterion for selecting the final models was the kinetic stability analysis, as we aimed to identify the most stable configurations. We acknowledge that the compatibility between the docking model and the full-length sCov2, considering possible steric clashes, is an essential factor to consider. For the two most stable models, namely model95 and model148, we carefully examined their structures. In the case of model148, illustrated in Figure 2D, we did not observe any apparent clashes between CD4 NTD and the full-length sCov2. However, we would like to emphasize that in model148, there is a possibility of CD4 NTD interacting with a second sCov2 RBD in its closed state. These interactions may involve polar interactions or mediation by water molecules when solvated. Nevertheless, based on our analysis, we do not anticipate that these few interactions play a significant role in the overall stability and function of the complex. To provide further clarity, we have made available a PyMOL session containing the structures used for the analysis in Figure 2. This session can be accessed via the following GitHub page: https://github.com/ajrferrari/CD4-RBD-interaction-models under the 'pymol-session' folder. We hope this additional information addresses the concern raised by the Reviewers. 15. The 4 \u00c5 cutoff for the temperature gradient-based structural stability check sounds reasonable, but would be more justifiable if the authors would also present a histogram of all RMSDs (of final aberrations) for all the tried models and show how outlying the 4 \u00c5 is in the whole distribution, additionally attributing a p-value on the selected cutoff. We appreciate the Reviewer's feedback regarding the justification for the 4 \u00c5 cutoff used in our temperature gradient-based structural stability check. We agree that providing additional analysis to support the chosen cutoff would enhance the validity of our findings. To further rationalize the selected cutoff, we conducted MD simulations on the sCov2 RBD and CD4 monomers independently (see figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1e). These simulations revealed that both monomers exhibited fluctuations ranging between 2 \u00c5 and 4 \u00c5 when evaluated up to 323K. These fluctuations serve as a baseline, indicating the inherent flexibility and dynamics of the individual monomers. In our analysis, models that crossed the 4 \u00c5 cutoff at any point during the MD trajectory were considered kinetically unstable, as they exhibited higher fluctuations than the individual monomers. We have now clarified this rationale in the main text to provide a clearer understanding of the criteria used for assessing stability. To address the Reviewer's suggestion, we have generated a histogram of the maximum backbone RMSD values for all the tried models. This histogram is provided in figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1f. It is important to note that the p-value obtained from the distribution of maximum RMSDs is 0.15. However, it is crucial to consider the characteristics of our evaluation process. Not all models completed the four MD steps, as some diffused away early during the evaluation. As a result, the distribution of maximum RMSDs observed is biased toward lower values. Consequently, the 4 \u00c5 cutoff appears less of an outlier than it would be if all models were equally sampled. We believe that this additional analysis, including the histogram of maximum RMSDs, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the distribution and relative position of the 4 \u00c5 cutoff. It accounts for the limitations of the sampling process and strengthens the justification for its selection. We have revised the manuscript to include these findings, addressing the Reviewer's' concern. 16. \"Methods\" section, \"Target selection\" subsection.

It would help if model 95 and model 148 were brought roughly in the same spatial orientation as the final CD4 NTD and full sCov2 RBD model, to aid the readers in matching and getting more insight. We appreciate the Reviewer's suggestion regarding Figure 2 and the importance of presenting model 95 and model 148 in a spatial orientation similar to that of the final CD4 NTD and full sCov2 RBD model. We agree that this would facilitate the readers' ability to match and gain deeper insights from the figure. In response to this valuable feedback, we have revised Figure 2 to ensure that model 95 and model 148 are now presented in a comparable spatial orientation to the final CD4 NTD and full sCov2 RBD model. This modification allows for a more straightforward visual comparison and enhances the clarity and comprehensibility of the figure.

Assessment of inflammatory and metabolic characteristics of a urbanizing African population and the comparison with populations outside Africa could provide insight in the pathophysiology of the rapidly increasing epidemic of NCDs, including the role of environmental and dietary changes. Using a proteomic plasma profiling approach comprising 92 inflammation-related molecules, we examined differences in the inflammatory proteome in healthy Tanzanian and healthy Dutch adults. We show that healthy Tanzanians display a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to Dutch subjects, with enhanced activity of the Wnt/-catenin signalling pathway and higher concentrations of different metabolic regulators such as 4E-BP1 and fibroblast growth factor 21. Among the Tanzanian volunteers, food-derived metabolites were identified as an important driver of variation in inflammation-related molecules, emphasizing the potential importance of lifestyle changes. These findings endorse the importance of the current dietary transition and the inclusion of underrepresented populations in systems immunology studies. - - Genetics and Genomics - Immunology and Inflammation CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ Trm) cells play key roles in many immune-inflammation-related diseases. However, their characteristics in the pathological process of oral lichen planus (OLP) remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the function of CD8+ Trm cells in the process of OLP. By using single-cell RNA sequencing profiling and spatial transcriptomics, we revealed that CD8+ Trm cells were predominantly located in the lamina propria adjacent to the basement membrane and were significantly increased in patients with erosive oral lichen planus (EOLP) compared to those with non-erosive oral lichen planus (NEOLP). Furthermore, these cells displayed enhanced production, including IFN- (Interferon-gamma, a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule), TNF- Necrosis cytokine regulating inflammation), and IL-17 (Interleukin-17, a cytokine involved in immune response modulation), in patients with EOLP. And our clinical cohort of 1-year follow-up was also supported the above results in RNA level and protein level. In conclusion, our study provided a novel molecular mechanism for triggering OLP erosion by CD8+ Trm cells to secrete multiple cytokines, and new insight "}
