You can also choose to leave your crystal out in the sunlight or moonlight as the energy of the earth will then purify the stone. Once your crystal is cleansed, you are ready to meditate! Simple Crystal Meditation If you are new to meditating with crystals, holding the stone in your hand whilst you meditate is a great way to get started and to connect your body and mind with the crystal. As you meditate, bring your awareness to the feel of the stone in your hand and allow its vibrations to connect with you. Remember to listen to the crystals you are holding, letting your spirit open to the natural energy of the stone. If you are holding a rough crystal, feel its edges against your skin and linger on the interaction between your physical form and its physical form. Take notice of any tingling or warming sensations that are coming from the crystal. Allow the energy to disperse throughout your body, calming and uplifting your soul. The crystal will clear your mind and help you relax and focus your meditation. Connecting With Your Chakras If you are wanting to unblock or stimulate a chakra during meditation, place the crystal on your body near to the chakra that needs healing. For example, if your heart chakra is underactive, lie down and place a rose quartz on your chest. This crystal purifies the heart and boosts self-love. As you are meditating with the crystal, be sure to focus on your intention and repeat mantras if you so wish. Similarly, if you are feeling if you cannot express yourself and speak your truth, you may wish to work with your throat chakra. To unblock your throat chakra with crystals, place an aquamarine on your throat and meditate with your intentions. The crystal will unblock your throat chakra and soothe the anxiety that was occurring. All chakras are connected to colors. These colors can be used to find crystals that can be used to unblock each chakra. Here is a list of the chakras, their colors, and a crystal that you can use to open up each chakra.

Color Visualisation A great way of meditating with crystals is to visualize their colors connecting with your soul or your chakras. This allows the mind to focus on the color, clearing your psyche and letting other thoughts fade away. Let us look at a guided meditation to use with crystals and their colors. This guided meditation is perfect for beginners and allows us to clear the mind and harness the energy of the crystals. Let's use the example of amethyst in this mediation, but of course, this technique can be used for any crystal either in your hands or on a chakra. - Firstly, make sure you are in a comfortable, safe space. Sit or lie down, with the [amethyst](https://www.crystals.com/collections/amethyst)in your hand. - Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Breathe in through your nose for seven counts and exhale through your mouth for eleven. Count along to your breathing, allowing your body to calm and relax. Exhale any negativity that you have been carrying. - When you feel ready, bring your mind to the amethyst in your hand. As your eyes are closed, you will not be able to see the stone, however, you can visualize it. Recall the color of the amethyst, its brilliant glowing purple. Picture the glow of purple energy in your hand. Pay attention to any vibrations and warmth that you may feel from the crystal. - Now, imagine the glow of purple energy rise up from the stone and into your body. Imagine the purple light flowing through your hands, up into your body, and into your heart and soul. Allow the vibrations of color to move through your body and flow with the rhythm of your breath. - When the energy of the amethyst is in your body, acknowledge any intentions you may have, or, sit in peace and harmony with the purple light. Allow any messages from the universe to come to you. - When you are ready, gently come back to your physical body and the world around you. Open up your eyes. Pay attention to the feel of the ground below you. Thank the crystal for helping you.
