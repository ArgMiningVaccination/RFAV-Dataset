The city is home to a dynamic environment rich in innovation, and a tradition for knowledge sharing between companies, hospitals, universities, and public research institutions. What better place to widen your perspective on the relationship between research in academia and the biotech industry? Is this program right for you? It is a good fit if you study: Biology Biochemistry Neuroscience Pre-Medicine/Health Science View this program at DISabroad.org Core Course Medical Biotechnology and Drug Development Fall/Spring, 3 Credits This course gives you an overview of the drug discovery and development processes where disease-targeted research leads to clinical treatments. Recent advances within medical biotechnologies and the latest treatment approaches are introduced, including stem cell technology, immunotherapies, and modern vaccines where the current 'fast track' development of new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the virus causing COVID-19, will be considered. You visit European pharmaceutical and biotechnology communities, university/hospital labs and start-up companies and get an insight into the business aspects of drug development and the many job niches of the field.
