A unique immersive experience blending traditional Usui Reiki + Sound Healing to begin to retrain the autonomic nervous system What is Usui Reiki? Usui Reiki is a traditional Japanese form of healing energy, literally translated as universal life-force energy. Reiki is activating energy by touching (or hovering over) another person, animal or plant. During Reiki, clients are fully clothed on a massage table while the practitioner lightly places their hands on the client or hover just above their body. What is Sound Healing? Sound healing is the transfer of vibrational frequencies into the cells of the nervous system. It helps your brain to more easily access a meditative state of theta brainwaves, triggering strong feelings of clarity and calm. Together, both forms of energy transfer are designed to compliment each other to help you retrain your autonomic nervous system to achieve a state of deep relaxation and balance. Energy applied to energy affects some type of change. Some may call it healing. It is all about intention from giver to receiver. Packages All sessions include traditional Usui Reiki healing treatment, along with an intuitively guided healing Sound bath and Chakra balancing. Sessions include time for discussion and self-care homework to take with you. $185 new client session (90-Minute) New client sessions allow for extra time to discuss intention for your treatment and answer any questions you may have. $150 reiki + sound healing (60-Minute) Our signature Reiki + Sound treatment.
