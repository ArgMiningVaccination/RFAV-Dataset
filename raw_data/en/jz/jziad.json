Information regarding the responsibilities a nd benefits of the chief resident will be dispersed to the residency class at the beginni ng of their residency year. RESIDENT RESPONSIBILITIES The UB SPPS residencies are 12-month, full-time appointments an d will take place from July 1st through June 30th unless otherwise arranged with an individual RPD. Outlined be low are activities and responsib ilities of all UB SPP S PGY1 residents. Clinical Activities Residency-specific: It is the r esponsibility of the individual RPD to work with their resident to design and implement a customiz ed residency experience meeti ng ASHP accreditation standards and program goals and ob jectives. The resident develo pment plan should be based Updated 8/16/2022 Page 8 of 56 both on the resident's interests a nd the resident's strengths and weaknesses as determined by RPD assessment and resident self-assessment. Resident Duty Hours Please see Appendix D, \"Duty-Hour R equirements for Pharmacy Res idencies,\" for more details. o Maximum Hours of Work per Week Per ASHP, duty hours must be lim ited to 80 hours per week, aver aged over a four-week period, inclusive of i nternal and external moonlighti ng. Moonlighting (i.e., voluntary, com pensated work performed within or outside the residency training site th at are not scheduled duty periods of the residency program) is permitted, however: Successful completion of residenc y training requires a signific ant time commitment. The PTAC therefore discourages residents from moonlighting. Each residen t who wishes moonlight: o Must obtain approval from th eir RPD. This should be documented in the residen t's development plan. o Must not exceed 24 hours/month. All moonlighting hours must be documented in monthly duty hour attestations and reviewed by RPD. Moonlighting must not affect the resident's judg ment while on scheduled duty periods (as assess ed by the preceptor or other supervising entity), interfere w ith their ability to provide safe patient care (as assessed by the preceptor or other supervising entity) , or impair their ability to achieve the educa tional goals and objectives of their residency program (as asse ssed by the preceptor and/or RP D). o If moonlighting appears to be a ffecting residen t performance during scheduled duty hours, resident and RPD will develop a remediation plan that may inc lude reduction in moonlighting hours or ceasing moonlighting activ ities. If resident does not comply with remediation plan or does not demonstrate improvement, resident will be subject to dismissal from the program. o Mandatory Time Free of Duty Residents must be scheduled for a minimum of one day free of du ty every 7 days (when averaged over four w eeks). At-home ca ll cannot be as signed on these free days. o Maximum Duty Period Length Continuous duty periods of residents should not exceed 16 hours in duration (see Appendix D for additional details). o Minimum Time Off between S cheduled Duty Periods Updated 8/16/2022 Page 9 of 56 Residents should have a minim um of 8 hours free of duty between scheduled duty periods. Recording of Duty Hours o It is the responsibility of each resident to keep an electronic log all of their duty hours and submit to their RPD monthly (by the 4th of the following month). It is recommended to use the duty hour tracking functionality in PharmAcademicTM. o The following activities are not included in the duty hour requ irement: reading, studying, academic preparation t ime (e.g. presentations, journa l clubs, closing knowledge gaps), travel time to a nd from work or conferences, o r other hours that are not scheduled by a residency preceptor or RPD (see Appendix D for additional information). o RPDs will be notified in PharmAcad emic if residents report violations of ASHP's duty hour policy. Evaluations All evaluations (both those completed by preceptor and resident ) should be completed using PharmAcademicTM in a timely manner. Evaluations must be completed in entirety (by the resident and preceptor) within 7 days of their scheduled due da te. It is the responsibility of the resident to complete rotation-s pecific evaluations and self- evaluations on schedule. It is the responsibility of the rotation preceptor to complete an evaluation of the resident and review this evaluati on with the resident at the conclusion of the rotation in order to provide constructive feedback. The resident and preceptor should complete and review evaluatio ns together. It is the responsibil ity of the RPD to ove rsee the evaluation p rocess. Teaching Activities Academic appointment: Residents will receive an appointment as a clinical instructor with the UB SPPS. Resident/Fellow Teaching Certifi cate Program: Residents acquire the basic skills needed to practice in the area of pharm acy academia. Upon completion of t he course, residents will be awarded a UB SPPS teaching certifi cate. The certificate progra m consists of 6-8 weekly seminars and multiple teaching requirements as detailed in the course syllabus. Residents are required to attend all seminars and it is required that all UB SPPS residents complete requirements to achieve the Advanced Academic Teaching Certific ate as opposed to the Basics of Teaching Certificate. Please see the syllabus for th e Teaching Certificate Program for additional information. (Note : these activit ies are include d in the requirements for program completion.) Updated 8/16/2022 Page 10 of 56 Experiential teaching: Each resident, with the guidance of thei r rotation preceptor, is expected to participate in student precepting/co-precepting for students completing their Introductory (IPPE) and Advanced (APPE) Pharmacy Practice Exper iences. Other academic / teaching activities: Each resident may be give n the opportunity to proctor pharmacy examinations and partic ipate on department or academic committees during the course of their residency year. Residency Project Each resident is required to par ticipate in a project relating to the area in which they are practicing. o The focus of the project should be r esidency director driven, b ut if deemed appropriate by the residency di rector, may be chosen by the res ident based on a mutual interest so as to allow fo r customization o f the learnin g experience. o Acceptable types of research include: clinical research, drug u se evaluation, administrative research, qualit y improvement research, survey-b ased research, laboratory research, etc., as l ong as it contains all the usual components of research (hypothesis, methods, s tatistics, etc.). o All projects that are expected t o be receive Investigational Review Board (IRB) approval in advance of b eginning the project. o Projects should be able to be com pleted in the span of the residency year. o A proposed project timeline will be provided to residents at th e start of the residency year. o Preliminary and/or final results of the project are to be prese nted at the UB SPPS Postgraduate Research Forum and a t least one national or one lo cal/regional conference. o Project writeup: A final manuscr ipt of the residency project mu st be submitted to the program director prior to the e nd of the residency year. The manuscript must undergo at least one round of edits by the RPD/preceptor/co-authors and be formatted to a specific journal agreed upon by the manuscript authors. A cover letter to the journal must be submitted with the manus cript. The decision to submit the manuscript for publication will be at the discretion of the research preceptor and/or RPD. If publication is pursued and resid ent does not maintain active involvement in manuscript writing, the position of primary author will be tran sferred to the RPD or preceptor overseeing the project. Fundamentals of Postgraduate Schol arship (formerly referred to as \"Didactic Resident Research Course\"): All PGY-1 residents are expected to attend t his course offered during July or August. Attendance is mandatory. Professional Presentations Updated 8/16/2022 Page 11 of 56 Residency Journal Club o Each resident is expected to all ocate 1-2 evenings per semester for attendance at Journal Club. Journal Club will be held in conjunction with th e UB SPPS Scholars Program (a program with an enhance d curriculum for our residency-bound students) to facilitate tiered learning. All residents are expected to attend the first journal club of the fall semester, as a faculty member will present and review resident expectations. Residents are expected to mentor two (2) Scholars students as t hey prepare and present a journal club. This will require the resident to r ead and critically evaluate the journal article, a pprove the article chosen by the student, and provide guidance to the student. R esidents must also attend the journal club at which their assigned s tudents present. Continuing Education Program o Each resident is required to prepare and present at least 1 con tinuing education program in coordination with the UB SPPS Office of Continuing E ducation. Presentation at a national meeting o Preliminary and/or final results of the residency project are t o be presented as a poster at the ASHP Midyear Clinical M eeting or other national/local/re gional meeting (i.e. APhA, appropriate by the RPD. UB SPPS Postgraduate Research Forum o Preliminary and/or final results of the residency project are t o be presented as a platform presentation at the UB SPPS Postgraduate Research Foru m in the spring. Eastern States Residency Conference o Research projects for all PGY1 residents (preliminary and/or final results) are to be presented at the Eastern States Residency Conference as a platf orm presentation each spring. Licensure Requirement for Residents It is the expectation of ASHP and UB SPPS PTAC that all residen ts obtain a New York State Pharmacy License prior to the sta rt of their residency training program, or if not possible, within 90 days of the start of their residency program. Theref ore, residents must be licensed as soon as possible, but no l ater than October 1st. o To assist pharmacy residents in obtaining licensure, UB SPPS re sidents are highly encouraged to participate in the NYS pharmacy law review offere d by the UB SPPS during the month of May or June preceding the start of their residency year. This program is offered free of charge to incoming UB SPPS residents. Updated 8/16/2022 Page 12 of 56 To obtain NYS licensure, incoming residents should follow the i nstructions on the NYS Education Department Office of the Professions website. oLicensure requirements: http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/pharm/pharmlic.htm oLicense application forms: h ttp://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/pharm/p harmforms.htm The must send proof of licensure to th eir RPD as soon as possible, but no later than October 1st. Residents unable to obtain licen sure prior to the start of thei r residency program MUST have a valid NYS pharmacy intern permit prior to their residency sta rt date. An intern permit can be obtained by filing Form 5. Pleas e see NYSED website for deta ils: http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/ pharm/pharmforms.htm If a resident is unable to obtain licensure prior to October 1st; o The resident may be dismisse d from the residency program. o The resident must contact their RPD and PTAC Chair prior to this date to set a meeting to obtain guidance for attaining li censure and meet tra ining program requirements so as to successfu lly complete the program and obt ain a completion certificate. If dismissal is defe rred, a plan will be set for the resident to obtain licensure. If necessa ry, training may need to be extended past June 30th to ensure that the resident completes at least 2/3 of their residency training as a licensed pharmacist. Any extension of the residency may be completed without compensation or benefits. Failure of the resident to meet goals set forth in the aforemen tioned plan will result in resident dismissal. Costs associated with licensure must be borne by the resident. Liability Requirement for Residents Professional Liability Insurance o All residents are required to carry their own professional liab ility insurance policy; limits of the insurance mu st be a minimum of $1,000,000 occurre nce/$3,000,000 aggregate effective on the start date of the residency program. Your practice site may request that they are listed as an additional insured or that a certificate of insurance is issued with them listed as a cer tificate holder. Please discus s site requirements with your RPD. The cost of the policy is the responsibility of the resident. Proof of coverage must be submitted prior t o the start of the residency year to Mary Enstice Kruszynski. Special Training Requirem ents for Residents Updated 8/16/2022 Page 13 of 56 All residents are required to complete training in the followin g areas prior to the start of the residency: o Collaborative IRB Initiative's (CITI) courses in the Protection of Human Research Subjects: https://www.citiprogram.org/default.asp When logging in be sure to indicat e SUNY - the University at Bu ffalo as your affiliated institution (not Buffalo State). This program requires seve ral hours to complete. Please complete the following courses: -Human Subjects Research for Bio medical Research ers (depending on project, the Social/Behavioral/Humanistic Course may also be required) -Conflict of Interest -Health Information Privacy and S ecurity (HIPS/HIPAA) \"Additional (GCP) (Under \"Additional Courses\") Submit your certificate( s) of completion to Mary Enstice Kruszynski . For more information about research and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University at Buffalo, please see: http://www.buffalo.edu/research/research- services/compliance/irb.html . Pharmacy Resident Professionalism Resident professionalism o It is the expectation of the PTA C that all UB SPPS residents w ill adhere to generally accepted standards of professionalism throughout the residency. o It is the expectation of the PTA C that all UB SPPS residents wi ll adhere to policies and procedures of their training program, their practice site a nd their employer of record (if the employer is not t he University or the practice s ite). o Residents deemed to be unprofes sional will be subject to disciplinary action and possible dismissal from the r esidency program (Appendix F). Residency Program Evaluation Strategy This section shall serve as a guide to RPDs and preceptors, out lining the minimum requirements for evaluation of residents. Summative Evaluations should be completed at the end of each learning experience and a minimum of quarterly for longitudinal learning experiences. Updated 8/16/2022 Page 14 of 56 Formative Evaluations (i.e. verbal feedback): are equa lly as important to resident g rowth as summative evaluations and should be provided frequently and consistently. Verbal feedback can and should be documented usin g PharmAcademic and may be linked to a specific objective or objectives, learni ng experience, and learning experience activity. Preceptor and Learning Experience Evaluations should be completed at the end of each learning experience. Resident Self-Evaluation is an important skill for reside nts to learn and with which to gain proficiency. At minimum, ASHP re quires that the resident self- evaluation objective be evaluated at LEAST three times ove r the course of the year, ide ally during three different learning experiences. More eval uations of this objective may b e added per the resident development plan if the resident requires additional practice. One suggested strategy for teaching residents to self-evalua te is to review a preceptor-co mpleted summative evaluation (or selected objectives from a summative evaluation) and a resi dent-completed summative K: Effectiv e Self-Assessment Monitoring the timeliness and quality of evaluations is the responsibility of the RPD but may be designated to another preceptor. Evaluations are consid ered timely if they are completed and submitted within sev en (7) days of the end of a learning experience. Evaluations should also be monito red for quality of the feedbac k contained therein. In general, feedback should be immed iate, specific and actionable. (Please see Appendix L for Tips for Providing Mea ningful Feedback.) RPDs are encouraged to send evaluations back for edits if they do not contain quality feedback. Summary of Requirements for Successful Completion of the Reside ncy Program Residents are responsible for upholding standards and policies of their practice site as well as residency program requirements. R esidents who are unable to meet or adhere to site standards and/or policies will be unable to successfully comple te residency training requirements. Residents who are unable to show sufficient progress towards ac hievement of program objectives will be unable to successfully complete the program (see Resident Progression Policy, below). Successful completion of the residency program entails: NYS Licensure by October 1st (see pertinent section) Completion of at least 1 2 full months of training Completion of: o Clinical rotations Updated 8/16/2022 Page 15 of 56 Attendance: Residents must not be absent for >3 days of 1-month learning experiences and >5 days for 3 month learning experiences and cu mulative time off must not exceed 20 days for the residency year. Achievement of residency program goals and objectives: By the final summative evaluation, the residency must: o Attain \"achieved for residency (ACHR)\" in 100% of the required patient care goals and objectives. o Attain \"achieved for residency (ACHR)\" in > 85% of the remainder of the progra m goals and objectives. o Attain \"needs improvement (NI )\" in 0% of the residency program specific evalua ted goals and objectives Note: a rating of NI on an obj ective earlier in the residency program does not preclude successful completion of the program. Definitions of ACH/SP/NI for Preceptors and Residents ACH (Achieved) - Resident consis tently demonstrat es independenc e and has refined judgment relate d to tasks in this area. SP (Satisfactory progress) - Resi dent is able to independently complete some tasks related to this area and is able to acknowledge limi tations. NI (Needs improvement) - Reside nt is unable to ask appropriate questions to supplemen t limitations and/or ha s a general defici t in this area. Attainment of ACHR (Achieved for residency) The PTAC defines ACHR as - Resid ent consistently demonstrates t he ability to independently perform and facilitate tasks relating to this objective such that no further evaluation of this objective is required. Each site RAC should determine whether ACHR for each program objective may be selected by an individual residency preceptor or discussed and agreed upon at a quarterly site RAC meeting. o Teaching activities Completion of Advanced Academic Teaching Certificate Prepare and instruct at least one (1) large group class/teachin g activity Participation in the patient car e plan activities in PHM 715: Pharmaceutical Care IV Participation in the PHM 505/ 506 (Patient Assessment I & II) sequence Precept/co-precept students during their Introductory (IPPE) an d/or Advanced (APPE) Pharmac y Practice Experiences Prepare and deliver at least one (1) ACPE-accredited continuing education (CE) program Preparation of a state ment of teaching philosophy Updated 8/16/2022 Page 16 of 56 o Residency project Complete a pharmacy (research) project relating to the resident 's area of practice Prepare a final manuscript and c over letter formatted to a spec ific journal that has undergone at least one round of internal edits o Professional presentations Participate in journal club as outlined above Present residency project as a p latform presentation at UB SPPS Postgraduate Research Forum Present residency project as a p latform presentation at the Eas tern States Residency Conference (or a comp arable regional meeting) Present residency project in abs tract/poster format at a suitab le national or regional/local meeting Residents who fail to meet thes e expectations will be considere d to have not graduated from the residency program and will not receive a residency certific ate o The UB SPPS is responsible for a dministering the school's PGY1 and PGY2 residency programs and provides ea ch graduating resident with a certificate of completion (residency certificate) in accordance with ASHP residency accreditation standards. The RPD is expected to complete the 'certification o f completion of residency program requirements' form (Appendix G) and return it to the PTAC chair no later than June 15th. Residency certificates will not be awarded until this documen t has been completed. Resident Progression Policy: While the above-listed achievem ent of ACHR for residency object ives does not impact the successful completion of the prog ram until the FINAL evaluation , it is a reasonable expectation that residents should be making s teady progress toward these criteria throughout the residency year. Therefore, it is the polic y of the UB SPPS residency pro gram that a resident should not receive any \"needs improvement\" ratings in the final quarter of the residency program. Inability to meet this interim requiremen t for progression may lead to de velopment of a performance improvement plan (if not already i n place) or resident dismissa l at the discretion of the RPD, as this performance likely indicates that the resident will be una ble to meet program completion criteria by the end of the program. Resident Wellbeing: A state of wellbeing requires ba lance in all areas of life. Re sidency training is demanding and keeping a focus on wellness and r esilience is important in preventing burnout. The UB SPPS residency program encourages resi dents to participate in progra mming that will help avoid burnout and promote wellbeing and resilience during the residen cy program. Discussion of wellbeing, resilience, and burnout, a s well as strategies to mi tigate burnout will be discussed at UB SPPS Resident/Fellow Orientation. Paid Time Off Updated 8/16/2022 Page 17 of 56 The resident has the option to us e Paid Time Off (PTO) to encou rage personal wellbeing. All time off should be discussed with t he resident program director and preceptor(s). Additional Activities Additional activities that my help to promote wellbeing and avo id burnout may occur based on discussion with the RPD or preceptors. These may include: Events with program d irector or preceptors o Incoming/Outgoing resident gathering o Dinner at ASHP Midyear mee ting and regional meeting Events with co-residents Regular check-ins with program director or primary preceptor Listening to podcasts on Mindfulness or Meditation Encouraging Meditation (sever al phone apps are available) Resident Recruitment Residents are expected to participate in recruitment of future residency candidates as determined by the RPD. Promotion of UB SPPS residency p rogram at nati onal meetings o ASHP Midyear Clinical Meeting Residency Showcase (PGY1 and PGY2 programs) Personnel placement service (PGY2 programs) o ACCP annual meeting o APhA annual meeting o NCPA annual meeting o AMCP annual meeting Pre-screening of res idency applicants o Applicants will be evaluated by pr ogram directors and/or progra m preceptors using an objective evaluation t ool (Appendix H): Academics performance Recommendations Pharmacy work experience APPE experience Teaching/presentation experience Professional involve ment and leadership Scholarship activity Letter of intent o Programs reserve the right t o make or deny offers for on-site i nterviews based on factors other than objective numer ic rating of th e items listed above and such information should be documented. Programs may opt for a preliminary telephone/video conference i nterview to determine whether a candidate should be offered an on-site interview. Updated 8/16/2022 Page 18 of 56 o All residency candidates will be provided online access to this Handbook and the appropriate policies when they are extended an offer for an onsite interview (i.e. leave policy, dismissal policy, require ments for completion of residency program) and will be asked to sign and return and ack nowledgement of receipt of t hese policies upon accepting an interview offer. o Any program entering into Phase I I of the Match will use the sa me process as described above to screen app licants. Depending on geographic location of the candidates, interviews with candi dates may take place on-site o r via telephone or video conference.

Resident Leave Policy Residency dependent: o UPRS-paid residents, please see UPRS, Inc. \"Employee Benefit an d Leave Policy\": http://pharmacy.buffalo.edu/academics/residency-training/how-to-apply-for- residency.important-documents.html o Site-paid residents, please refer to site policies Please note that requirements f or successful completion of the program supersede site policies regarding time off. Completion of residency program requirements o If an emergency medical situati on requiring long-term leave arises during a resident's contracted term, the resident mu st notify their RPD and the PT AC chair as soon as possible. o If a resident requires long-ter m leave during their residency p rogram: The resident must formulate a pl an for residency completion wit h their RPD and the PTAC chair.

ASHP DutyHour Requirements for Pharmacy Residencies Purpose Statement Residency program directors and preceptors have the professional responsibility to provide residents with a sound training program that must be planned, scheduled a nd balanced with concerns for patients' safety and residents' wellbeing. Therefore, programs must comply with the requirements outlined in this policy to ensur e optimal clinical experience and education for their program's residents. Statement on WellBeing and Resilience A. Residents are at an increased risk for burnout and depression due to the nature of the healthcare environment and psycho logical, emotional, and physic al wellbeing are critical in the development of the competent, ca ring, and resilient pharmacist. B. As part of the development of the resident, it is the responsib ility of the pharmacy leaders to ensure residents are educated on wellness and resilience, inclu ding education on burnout syndrome, the risks, and mitigation strategies as part of the orientation to th e residency. C. It is also the responsibility of pharmacy leaders to ensure pre ceptors are educated on burnout syndrome, including the risks and mitigation strategies, in ord er to help identify and provide resources for atrisk residents, and to recognize when it may be in the best interest of patients to transition care to another qualified, rested pharmacist. D. As part of promoting a culture of wellness, pharmacy leaders mu st ensure that there is not excessive reliance on residents t o fulfill service obligations that do not contribute to the educational value of the residency program or that may compromi se residents' fitness for duty and endanger patient safety. Howe ver, as members of the healthc are team, residents may be required to participate in departmental coverage in times of unusual circumstances/state of emergency situations (e.g., masscasualty, downtime, and natura l disasters, pandemic) that go beyond the designated duty hours for a limited timeframe. II. Duty Hour Requirements A. Duty hours: Defined as all hours spent on scheduled clinical an d academic activities, regardless of setting, related to the pharmacy residency program that are required to meet the educational goals and objectives of the program. 1.

If a program exceeds 16 hours of continuous duty periods, the \" In House Call Program\" limitations apply as described in the corresponding section. E. Tracking of Compliance with Duty Hours 1. Programs must have a method in place to track compliance with the Duty Hour Requirements for Pharmacy Residencies Policy. The documentation method used must allow the reviewer to determ ine compliance with all requirements outlined in this policy including hours worked, ho urs free of work, and frequency of all call programs. (e.g., attestation of complianc e by the resident, hours worked) 2. Review of tracking method must be completed on a monthly basis. 3. Any instances of noncompliance with this policy identified sho uld be assessed and actions taken, as needed, to avoid future instances of noncompliance. III.

Moonlighting (internal or external) must not interfere with the ability of the resident to achieve the educational goals and object ives of the residency program, and must not interfere with the resident's fitness for work nor c ompromise patient safety. It i s at the discretion of the residency program director whether to permit or to withdraw moonlighting privileges. C. All moonlighting hours must be counted towards the clinical exp erience and educational work 80hour maximum weekly hour limit averaged over a fourweek per iod and included in the tracking of hours. D. Programs that allow moonlighting must have a documented structu red process that includes at a minimum: The type (internal only, external only, or both) and maximum nu mber of moonlighting hours allowed by the program per week, pay period or month. Requirement for the resident to receive approval for moonlighti ng hours and to inform the residency program director of their completed moonlighting hours.

Early Commitment Policy Background: The ASHP Pharmacy Match Program includes an Early Commitment Pr ocess whereby a PGY1 resident may commit to a PGY2 residency offered by the same program sponsor. This process occurs prior to the matching process, and removes both the PGY2 residency and the resident from formal participation in the match. The PGY2 program in question must be registered for the Match; however, the PGY1 resident need not be registered. The PGY1 applicant must be a resident in a residency program offere d by the same sponsor as the PGY2 residency (e.g., the same or affiliated organiza tion). In addition, the PGY1 an d PGY2 residencies must be consecutive years of employment for the resident. Details can be found at: https://natmatch.com/ashprmp/ecp.html Procedure: 1. PGY1 residents interested in com pleting a PGY2 residency (Psych iatry or Ambulatory Care) at the University at Buffalo must subm it a curriculum v itae and letter of interest to the PG Y2 Residency Program Director by October 1st. 2. The PGY1 resident will then be formally interviewed by the PGY2 Residency Program Director and program preceptors. 3. Pending the results of the interv iew process, the PGY2 residenc y position will be off ered to the PGY1 candidate by October 15th. Note: the PGY2 Residency Program Director must inform the candidate of the decision prior to the ASHP-PPS and match deadline. This wi ll be followed up with an offer letter to the resident. 4. Pending acceptance (resident has 1 week to accept offer), both the resident and the PGY2 Residency Program Director must sign the AS HP Letter of Agreement and sub mit it to the National Matching Service (NMS) by mid-December (see annua l deadline). This will remove the PGY2 residency position and the resident (if applicable) from the matching process. 5. The PGY2 residency program must pay a fee to the National Matching Service (NMS) for each position committed to a resident via the Early Commitment Process. This fee must be receive d by the annual deadline. 6. PGY1 program requirements must be completed prior to the start of PGY2 training. Updated 8/16/2022 Page 46 of 56 Appendix K: Evaluations and Assessments Helpful Definitions Formative Evaluation vs. Summative Evaluation Assessments or evaluations allow program directors, preceptors, and residents to monitor progress towards achieving program objectives. Formative evaluation occurs during a learning experience. Formative evaluation, including ongoin g feedback during learning experiences to make the resident aware of strengths and areas of improvement so that they may continue to make ongoing improvements in their performance. Formative evaluations are generally viewed as \"low stakes\" assessments. Summative evaluation occurs at the end of a learning experience to assess resident progress toward program objectives. It is often viewed as a more \"high stakes\" assessment, particularly with regard to program requirements surrounding achievement of program require ments. Both formative and summative evaluations should be based on the resident's ability to meet pre-specified objectives. The measurement of the quality of the resident's p erformance and the progress they are making towards meeting these objectives are based on criteria. ASHP gives examples of criteria for each objective, however, these lists are not exhaustive. Residents and preceptors should look to the learning experience descriptions for objectives evaluated during a given learning experience as well as the activity or activities that will facilitate the achievement of the objec tives. Self-Evaluation Resident self-evaluation may be either formative or summative i n nature, as describe d above. It should also be a criteria-b ased process by which the resident judges t he quality of his/her own work and learning. This process should also lead to i dentification of strengths & weaknesses in their work to allow them to revise accordingly. Preceptors should discuss resident self-evaluations with the re sident differences between the preceptor's evaluations of resident perform ance and self-evaluations perfor med by the resident. Preceptors should also provide written comments i n summative self-evaluations abo ut how residents can improve their self- evaluation skills. Resident elf-evaluation ability is tracked in quarterly development plans. Self-Reflection Self-reflections include self-exa mination and introspection and include the learner's global view of his/her learning in which the learner reflects on professional growth over time and aspirations for the future. At the beginning of the residency, residents self-reflect by as king themselves questions about their short (residency) and long-term prof essional aspirations or career go als (3 to 5 years after the residency), etc. At the end of the residency program, residents self-reflect by asking themselves questions about their major areas of improvement during the residency, about their pr ofessional growth, what about the Updated 8/16/2022 Page 47 of 56 program was especially satisfying , and how their career and per sonal goals have changed over the course of the residency program. Why do a self-assessment? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FnkFesZSYk When to do one: Beginning, middle, end How to do one: Reflect on activity, focusing on opportunities to improve Goals: 1. Make yourself accountable for your progress. 2. Able to accurately asses s your knowledge, skills and abilit ies. Your self-assessment is consistent with preceptors/mentors/supervisors. Once you have identified areas to improve, seek information and guidance Set SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, T ime-sensitive From: http://topachievement.com/smart.html (accessed 7/10/2015): Creating S.M.A.R.T. Goals : Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely Specific: A specific goal has a much greater chance of being accomplishe d than a general goal. To set a specific goal you must answer the six \"W\" questions: *Who: Who is involved? *What: What do I want to accomplish? *Where: Identify a location. *When: Establish a time frame. *Which: Identify requirements and constraints. *Why: Specific reasons, purpo se or benefits of accomplishi ng the goal. EXAMPLE: A general goal would be, \"Get in shape.\" But a specif ic goal would say, \"Join a health club and workout 3 days a week.\" Measurable - Establish concrete criteria for measuring progress toward th e attainment of each goal you set. When you measure your progress, you stay on track, reach your t arget dates, and experience the exhilaration of achievement that spurs you on to continued effo rt required to reach your goal. To determine if your goal is me asurable, ask questions such as... ... How much? How many? How will I know when it is accomplished? Updated 8/16/2022 Page 48 of 56 Attainable - When you identify goals that are most important to you, you begin to figure out ways you can make them come true. You de velop the attitudes, abilities, skills, and financial capacity to reach them. You begin seeing previously ove rlooked opportunities to bring y ourself closer to the achievement of your goals. You can attain most any goal you set when you plan your steps w isely and establish a time frame that allows you to carry out those step s. Goals that may have seemed far away and out of reach eventually move closer and become attainab le, not because your goals shrin k, but because you grow and expand to match them. When you list your goals you build your self-image. You see yourself as worthy of these goals, and develop the traits and personality that allow you to possess them. Realistic - To be realistic, a goal must r epresent an objective toward wh ich you are both willing and able to work. A goal can be both high and realistic; you are the onl y one who can decide just how high your goal should be. But be sure that every goal represents substantial progress. A high goal is frequently easier to reach than a low one because a low goal exerts low motivational force. Some of the hardest jobs you ever accomplished actually seem easy simply because they were a labor of love. Timely - A goal should be grounded wi thin a time frame. With no time frame tied to it there's no sense of urgency. If you want to lose 10 lbs, when do you want to los e it by? \"Someday\" won't work. But if you anchor it within a timeframe, \" by May 1st\", then you've set you r unconscious mind into motion to begin working on the goal. Your goal is probably realistic if you truly believe that it can be accomplished. Additional ways to know if your goal is realistic is to determine if you have accomplished anything similar in the past or ask yourself what conditions would have to exist to accomplish this goal. T can also stand for Tangible - A goal is tangible when you can experience it with one of the senses, that is, taste, touch, smell, sight or hearing. When your goal is tangible you ha ve a better chance of making i t specific and measurable and thus attainable. Updated 8/16/2022 Page 49 of 56 Appendix L: Tips for Provi ding Meaningful Feedback Quality feedback should: Be specific and actionable Be timely...the sooner feedback occurs, the more impactful it wil l be. Use criteria related to speci fic educational objectives Recognize what the resident does well Focus on how the resident may imp rove his/her performance...consider the use of \"You should...\" statements to he lp direct the did fine.\" vs \"Your medica tion reconciliat ion with the patient generally went well. You were very careful to review all of the medication bottles and take note of the refill dates and how many tablets were left in order to estimate adherence. However , you didn't really probe the patient for information on how she takes the medications. Next time, you should try asking more open-ended questions to get the patient speaking more freely.\" Updated 8/16/2022 Page 50 of 56 Appendix M: Program Structures Updated 8/16/2022 Page 51 of 56 Scheduled Learning Experiences for Assigned Goals Community Pharmacy - Middleport Family Health Center Filter: All Curricular Sets Achieved For Residency?
