Note: The Overview section summarizes the published evidence on this topic. The rest of the summary describes the evidence in more detail. Other PDQ summaries on Cervical Cancer Screening and Cervical Cancer Treatment are also available. Who Is at Risk? Carcinogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the primary, etiologic, infectious agents that cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer. HPV type 16 (HPV-16) and HPV type 18 (HPV-18) are most often associated with invasive disease.[ Factors With Adequate Evidence of an Increased Risk of Cervical Cancer Human papillomavirus (HPV) Based on solid evidence from observational studies, HPV infection is associated with the development of cervical cancer. Magnitude of Effect: HPV has been implicated as the primary etiologic infectious agent causing virtually all cases of cervical cancer. |Study Design: Evidence obtained evidence, being immunosuppressed is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. |Study Design: Evidence obtained an early age and with a greater number of partners Based on solid evidence, sexual activity at a younger age and an increasing number of sexual partners are both associated with an increased risk of HPV infection and subsequent development of cervical cancer. Magnitude of Effect: Women who experience first sexual intercourse at age 17 years or younger or women who have had six or more lifetime sexual partners have approximately two to three times the risk of squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, compared with women aged 21 years or older or who have a single sexual partner.[ |Study Design: Evidence Based on solid evidence, high parity is associated with increased risk of cervical cancer in HPV-infected women. Magnitude of Effect: Among HPV-infected women, those who have had seven or more full-term pregnancies have approximately four times the risk of squamous cell cancer compared with nulliparous women, and HPV-infected women also have two to three times the risk of women who have had one or two full-term pregnancies.[ |Study Design: of oral contraceptives Based on solid evidence, long-term use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risk of cervical cancer in HPV-infected women. Magnitude of Effect: Among HPV-infected women, those who used oral contraceptives for 5 to 9 years have approximately three times the incidence of invasive cancer, and those who used them for 10 years or longer have approximately four times the risk.[ |Study Design: Evidence exposure Based on solid evidence, cigarette smoking, both active and passive, is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer in HPV-infected women. Magnitude of Effect: Among HPV-infected women, current and former smokers have approximately two to three times the incidence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive cancer. Passive smoking is also associated with increased risk but to a lesser extent. |Study Design: Evidence obtained exposure Based on solid evidence, DES exposure is associated with an increased risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Magnitude of Effect: About one in 1,000 women exposed to DES in utero will develop a clear cell adenocarcinoma of the cervix. |Study Design: Adequate Evidence of a Decreased Risk of Cervical Cancer Sexual abstinence Based on solid evidence, abstinence from sexual activity is associated with a near-total reduction in the risk of developing cervical cancer. Magnitude of Effect: Sexual abstinence essentially precludes HPV transmission. |Study Evidence of a Decreased Risk of Cervical Cancer Note: Based on solid evidence, screening with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test and screening with the HPV DNA test reduces cervical cancer incidence. For more information on these screening tests, see Cervical Cancer Screening. HPV vaccination: benefits Based on solid evidence, vaccination against HPV-16/HPV-18 is effective in preventing HPV infection in HPV-naive individuals and is associated with a reduced incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 and 3. By extrapolation, these vaccines should also be associated with a reduced incidence of cervical cancer. Magnitude of Effect: Vaccination against HPV-16 and HPV-18 reduces incident and persistent infections with efficacy of 91.6% (95% confidence interval obtained from randomized controlled trials (for intraepithelial precursor lesions) and cohort study analyses (for evidence, harms of HPV vaccines include injection-site reactions, dizziness and syncope, headache, and fever. Vaccination during pregnancy has not been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.[ |Study Design: protection during sexual intercourse: benefits Based on solid evidence, the use of barrier methods (e.g., condoms) during sexual intercourse is associated with a decreased risk of cervical cancer. Magnitude of Effect: Total use of barrier protection decreases cervical cancer incidence (relative risk, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9). |Study protection during sexual intercourse: harms Based on fair evidence, the use of barrier methods during sexual intercourse is associated with few serious harms. Barrier methods can break, potentially resulting in unintended pregnancy. Allergic reactions to the barrier material (e.g., natural latex) can occur. |Study Design: Evidence obtained cervical cancers and 4,310 cervical cancer deaths will occur in the United States in 2023.[ References: HPV Epidemiological studies to evaluate risk factors for the development of squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical malignancy demonstrate conclusively a sexual mode of transmission of a carcinogen.[ Immunosuppression Most cases of HPV infection are resolved by the host immune system. Immunosuppression leads to persistence of viral infection with a subsequent increased risk of cervical neoplasia. Women with immunosuppression resulting from HIV infection have been studied over the past three decades of the AIDS epidemic. In one North American study, a group of 13,690 HIV-infected women were studied for a median of 5 years. The rate of invasive cervical cancer in the HIV-infected women was 26 cases per 100,000 women, and this was approximately four times greater than an HIV-uninfected control group.[ Sexual Activity at an Early Age and With a Greater Number of Partners HPV infection has been established as a necessary cause of almost all cases of cervical cancer, and the primary mode of transmission is sexual contact. This provides context for the findings that younger age at first intercourse and an increasing number of lifetime sexual partners are both associated with an increased risk of developing cervical cancer. Pooled, individual, patient-level data from 12 cohort and case-control studies demonstrated statistically significantly increased risks of developing cervical cancer in women who were aged 17 years or younger at first intercourse, compared with women who were aged 21 years or older at first intercourse (relative risk [RR] for squamous cell cancer, 2.24; 95% for adenocarcinoma, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.83-2.33). Similar findings were observed in women who had six or more lifetime sexual partners, compared with women who had one lifetime sexual partner (RR for squamous cell cancer, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.62-3.40 and RR for adenocarcinoma, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.07-3.36).[ High Parity High parity has long been recognized as a risk factor for cervical cancer, but the relation of parity to HPV infection was uncertain. A meta-analysis of 25 epidemiological studies, including 16,563 women with cervical cancer and 33,542 women without cervical cancer, showed that the number of full-term pregnancies was associated with increased risk, regardless of age at first pregnancy. This finding was also true if analyses were limited to patients with high-risk HPV infections (RR, 4.99; 95% CI, 3.49-7.13 for seven or more pregnancies vs. no pregnancies; linear trend test X2 = 30.69; P < .001).[ Long-term Use of Oral Contraceptives Long-term use of oral contraceptives has also been known to be associated with cervical cancer, but its relation to HPV infection was also uncertain. A pooled analysis of HPV-positive women from the studies described above was undertaken. Compared with women who have never used oral contraceptives, those who have used them for fewer than 5 years did not have an increased risk of cervical cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52-1.03). The OR for women who used oral contraceptives for 5 to 9 years was 2.82 (95% CI, 1.46-5.42), and for 10 or more years, the OR was 4.03 (95% CI, 2.09-8.02).[ Cigarette Smoke Exposure Cigarette smoking by women is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma.[ DES Exposure Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic form of estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women in the United States between 1940 and 1971 to prevent miscarriage and premature labor. DES is associated with a substantially increased risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix among the daughters of women who used the drug during pregnancy (standardized incidence ratio, 24.23; 95% CI, 8.89-52.74); the risk persists as these women age into their 40s.[ DES exposure in utero is also associated with an increased risk of developing cervical dysplasia. An evaluation of three cohorts, including the Diethylstilbestrol Adenosis study, the Dieckmann study, and the Women's Health Study, with long-term follow-up of more than 4,500 women exposed in utero to DES, found that 6.9% of exposed women developed grade II or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, compared with 3.4% of nonexposed women (hazard ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.59-3.27).[ References: Sexual Abstinence Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is transmitted during sexual activity. Therefore, cervical cancer is seen more frequently in women with sexual activity at an early age and with multiple partners.[ References: HPV Vaccination Given the etiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the pathogenesis of cervical neoplasia, vaccines to immunize individuals against HPV infection offer a primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer. A quadrivalent (HPV type 6 [HPV-6], type 11 [HPV-11], type 16 [HPV-16], and type 18 [HPV-18]) vaccine using a late protein L1 construct to induce antibody-mediated immunity was approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006; a bivalent (HPV-16, -18) vaccine was approved in 2009; and a vaccine targeting nine HPV types was approved in 2014. Vaccination during pregnancy has not been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.[ Persistent infection with oncogenic types of HPV, such as HPV-16 and HPV-18, is associated with the development of cervical cancer.[ A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 2,391 women aged 16 to 23 years and randomly assigned them to receive either 40 \u00b5g of HPV-16 L1 VLP vaccine or placebo on day 1, at 2 months, and at 6 months. Papanicolaou (Pap) tests and genital samples for HPV-16 DNA were obtained on day 1, at 7 months, and every 6 months for 48 months. Colposcopy and cervical biopsies were obtained when clinically indicated at study exit. Serum HPV-16 antibody titers were obtained at study entry, at 7 months, and then every 6 months. A total of 1,505 women (755 receiving vaccine and 750 receiving placebo) completed all three vaccinations and had follow-up after month 7. After immunization, HPV titers peaked at month 7, declined through month 18, and then stabilized in months 30 through 48. There were no cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in the vaccine-treated women, but there were 12 cases in the placebo group (six CIN 2 and six CIN 3). HPV-16 infection that persisted for at least 4 months was seen in seven vaccine-treated women, compared with 111 placebo-treated women.[ An international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a bivalent HPV-16/HPV-18 VLP vaccine was performed in 1,113 women aged 15 to 25 years with normal cervical cytology who were seronegative for HPV-16, HPV-18, and 12 other oncogenic HPV types at enrollment. Women received either vaccine or placebo at 0, 1, and 6 months and were assessed by cervical cytology and self-obtained cervicovaginal samples for at least 18 months. A masked treatment-allocation follow-up study was performed for an additional 3 years, for a combined analysis of up to 6.4 years of follow-up. The 12-month persistent infection rate of HPV-16 or HPV-18 in an according-to-protocol cohort (i.e., women who received all three doses of vaccine or placebo on the correct schedule) was 0 of 401 women in the vaccine arm, compared with 20 of 372 women in the placebo arm, with a vaccine efficacy rate of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.8%-100%). Diagnoses of CIN 2 or higher in a total vaccinated cohort (i.e., women who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo) were 0 of 481 women in the vaccine arm compared with 9 of 470 women in the placebo arm, with a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI, 51.3%-100%). Adverse events were similar in vaccinated and placebo-treated women. Neither analysis was intention-to-treat (ITT), making it difficult to know what the true vaccine efficacy for either virological or cytohistological endpoints would be in the routine clinical setting. Furthermore, cytohistological outcomes were reported only as composite endpoints (CIN 2+), making it impossible to distinguish the vaccine's efficacy against invasive cervical cancer alone and potentially inflating the observed efficacy by including lesions with a relatively high probability (approximately 50% for CIN 2 [ |Estimated Relative Reduction (95% CI)| and -18) was evaluated in a multinational, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 17,622 women aged 15 to 26 years (FUTURE I and II).[ |Population||Point Estimate and 95% CI| HPV-CIN 3||100% (90.5%-100%) lesions -11, -16, or -18| |ITT CIN 3||45.3% (29.8%-57.6%) for lesions associated with HPV-6, -11, -16, or -18| This study also demonstrated decreased rates of abnormal Pap tests and subsequent diagnostic procedures. No cases of invasive cervical cancer were identified during the trial. A 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine was studied in another international randomized trial, which included 14,215 women. This new vaccine, 9vHPV, includes the four HPV types in the quadrivalent vaccine, qHPV (6, 11, 16, 18) and also 5 more oncogenic types (31, 33, 45, 52, 58). Sexually active women aged 16 to 26 years with fewer than five lifetime sexual partners received three intramuscular injections (day 1, month 2, and month 6) of either the qHPV vaccine or the 9vHPV vaccine. Women were evaluated every 6 months for up to 5 years. The rate of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease was the same in both groups (14.0 per 1,000 person-years) because of preexisting HPV infection, but the rate of disease related to HPV-31, -35, -45, -52, and -58 was lower in the 9vHPV vaccine group (0.1 vs. 1.6 per 1,000 person-years). Injection-site reactions were more common in the 9vHPV group.[ All forms of the HPV vaccine are currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States as a two-dose schedule at least 6 months apart for adolescents younger than 15 years. The current CDC recommendation for older individuals is to receive the original three-dose series. Recently, given issues of cost and adherence, there has been published data investigating whether similar vaccine efficacy could be obtainable using a reduced-dose schedule. A post hoc combined analysis of two phase III randomized controlled trials of the bivalent HPV vaccine (the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial and the PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults [PATRICIA] Trial) found that among women who were not HPV positive at enrollment for the specific virus type being studied, vaccine efficacy against either one-time incident detection of HPV 16/18 or incident infection that persisted at least 6 months was not statistically significantly different for those who received all three, two, or only one of the scheduled HPV vaccine doses (resulting from nonadherence or other factors) for up to 4 years of follow-up. Vaccine efficacy rates for persistent HPV 16/18 infection ranged from 89.1% (95% CI, 86.8%-91.0%) for three doses, to 89.7% (95% 73.3%-99.8%) for two doses, to 96.6% (95% CI, 81.7%-99.8%) for one dose. To date, there are no randomized controlled trials that directly assess this clinical question.[ On the basis of their mechanism of action, L1/2 HPV vaccines do not appear to impact preexisting infections. The FUTURE II trial demonstrated a markedly lower vaccine efficacy rate in the total randomized study population, which included individuals who were positive for HPV at baseline, compared with the per-protocol population (44% for lesions associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18, and 17% for lesions associated with any HPV type vs. 98%; see Table 2 above).[ The type-specific vaccines, if successful in preventing invasive cancer, will offer protection for only a subset of cases, the proportion of which will vary worldwide.[ There is growing evidence of population-level impacts and herd immunity with HPV vaccination. There are data that explore the impact of national HPV vaccination programs and report on vaccine effectiveness. These data come from studies conducted in different countries throughout the world including England, Denmark, Australia, Costa Rica, and the United States. In England, 15,459 residual genital specimens from women aged 16 to 24 years, collected for Chlamydia trachomatis screening between 2010 and 2016, were utilized for national HPV surveillance.[ A study of cervical HPV DNA among 202 Australian women aged 18 to 24 years who were sampled between 2005 and 2007, before implementation of a national quadrivalent prophylactic HPV vaccine program, compared the results with a matched group of 1,058 women who were sampled in the postvaccination era (2010-2012). This study found an adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) among fully vaccinated women of 0.07 (95% CI, 0.04-0.14; P < .0001) for vaccine-related HPV types and a smaller but statistically significant magnitude of protection of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.43-0.96; P < .03) among unvaccinated women, suggesting herd immunity (protection of unvaccinated individuals).[ Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2018 demonstrated an increasing impact of the HPV vaccination program and herd protection in the United States.[ Association of HPV vaccination with reduced incidence of invasive cervical cancer In a nationwide population-based cohort study of the impact of the national vaccination program in Sweden using quadrivalent vaccine, more than 1.67 million women aged 10 to 30 years with no previous history of HPV vaccination were followed through the national registry using individual person linkage.[ Use of Barrier Protection During Sexual Intercourse Barrier methods of contraception are associated with a reduced incidence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) presumptively secondary to protection from sexually transmitted disease.[ References: The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available.
