Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-MadisonParasites \u2014 What are they? The word \"parasites\" conjures up images of gross- looking tapeworms, roundworms, and fleas, or ofblood-borne diseases such as malaria and schistoso-miasis. Many have been considered problems con-fined to tropical countries and places with poorsanitation and therefore of little concern to the U.S.However, recent outbreaks of parasitic diseases havedemonstrated the inaccuracy of these assumptions.Not all parasites live only in the tropics [as witnessthe Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak ( 179)], and consumers in the U.S. can be exposed to parasitesthat originate in the tropics because of increasinginternational travel [ Angiostrongylus in tourists re- turning from Jamaica ( 252)] and globalization of food markets [ Cyclospora on raspberries from Guatemala (128)]. Finally, some of the most important parasites are neither tapeworms, insects, nor blood-borne. Parasites are organisms that obtain their food from other living creatures. A \"good\" or well-adapted para-site does not kill its host because it depends on thehost for a steady supply of food over a long period oftime. Usually parasites are smaller than their foodsource and this distinguishes them from predatorssuch as tigers, which also eat other living things.Some parasites live in only one species of animal butmany parasites, particularly the worms, spend part oftheir lives reproducing sexually in a final or definitivehost and developing asexually as larvae during anotherpart of their life in an intermediate host of a differentspecies. Different life cycles will be described in alater section. It has been estimated that humans harbor about 300 species of parasitic worms and over 70 speciesof protozoa ( 27;51;212 ). Many of these have co- existed with us for thousands of years and have beenidentified among human remains by archaeologists(62;104;116;123;173;213;231 ). We may have inher- ited some parasites from our primate ancestors, whileothers were acquired from companion and food ani-mals. Not all parasites are foodborne and some arevery rare. This review will summarize information on the more common foodborne parasites, including threetypes of worms and are larger and more complex thanbacteria. These parasites are generally not susceptibleto antibiotics that kill bacteria but there are effectivedrugs to treat some (not all) parasitic infections. What foods have the potential forcarrying parasites? Parasites of concern to food safety professionalsinclude several worms, ranging from a few centime-ters to several meters in length, and protozoa, singlecelled organisms (202;212 ) (Table 1). Many parasitic infections are asymptomatic, others cause acute short-lived effects, and still others may persist in the bodycausing chronic effects ( 195). Protozoa Protozoan parasites may be present in freshwatersources that have been contaminated with human oranimal feces; fruits and vegetables grown or washedwith such contaminated water may have parasites ontheir surface and be sources of infection. Toxoplasma is sometimes present in raw meat, particularly pork,and thorough cooking is needed to destroy it. Someprotozoa are very species specific and can survive inonly one species of animal, but others, includingmany human pathogens, can live in humans and inother animals and these animals may act as reservoirscontinually shedding parasites into the environment.Protozoan parasites have a resistant resting stage(cyst or oocyst) which can withstand some dryingand disinfectants. Foodborne parasitic worms Cestodes (tapeworms): Meat and fish may contain larval tapeworms that can develop into adults in thehuman intestine. The pork and beef tapeworms arethe best known ( Taenia solium and T. saginata , respectively) but there are also other species withlarval stages in fish muscles. Tapeworm eggs maybe present on fruits or vegetables fertilized withhuman wastes or washed with contaminated water.If humans consume the eggs of T. solium, the larvae hatching from the eggs burrow out of the intestineand travel to the muscles, brain, and other parts ofthe body where they encyst and may cause seriousproblems. http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdfFRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites 3 Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-MadisonNematodes (round worms) include the following such as Ascaris, have a simple life cycle that does not require an intermediate host but may be passed from one human to another by fecally contaminatedwater or vegetables. Others, including Trichinella, Gnathostoma, and Anisakis , exist as cysts in muscles of meat or fish and may ( Trichinella ) or may not (Anisakis and Gnathostoma) develop into adults in humans who consume infected meat. Angiostrongylus utilizes two intermediate hosts and may be present insnails and on leafy vegetables. Trematodes (flatworms or flukes) usually have two or more intermediate hosts. Some may be presenton aquatic vegetables or foods washed in contami-nated water ( Fasciola and Fasciolopsis) while others encyst in fish (Clonorchis) or crabs and wild boar (Paragonimus ).How much of a problem are parasites? Worldwide, parasites infect millions of people(Table 2.) In some underdeveloped regions, theyare a major cause of childhood diarrhea and stuntingof growth and cause significant economic lossesrelated to human health and to agriculture ( 72;111; 233). In the U.S. the number of people affected by parasites is proportionally much smaller than inunderdeveloped parts of the world, and viruses andbacteria are more frequent causes of foodborneillness in the U.S. However, parasites are becomingmore of a concern for the following reasons: - Increasing imports of fruits, vegetables, and ethnic foods, some of which originate in countrieswithout modern sanitary facilities and inspectionsystems, may introduce parasites. Table 1. Parasites found in different foods. Foods Protozoa Nematodes bear, horse, wild boar) (wild boar, (lamb, mutton) Gnathostoma (frogs, snakes) guinea pig) Milk Cryptosporidium by Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madison- Immigrants from under-developed countries may be infected with parasites that could be transmissible to others, particularly during foodpreparation. - The popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods, such as sushi and raw pork sausages, may increaseexposure to parasites. - As our population ages and more people have deficient immune systems, parasitic infections mayhave more severe consequences, as demonstratedin Cryptosporidium outbreaks ( 101;137). - Although parasitic infections may not be very frequent in the U.S., some parasites can causesevere chronic effects such as neurologicalproblems caused by the pork tapeworm (neuro-cysticercosis) and by Toxoplasma and liver cancer associated with Clonorchis ( 138;159;277). - An interesting issue being considered by some parasitologists is the potential spread of parasiticdiseases as global warming proceeds. Somediseases are presently confined to tropicaland subtropical areas because cysts or intermediatehosts are not cold hardy. But if lake temperatureswarm up and winter temperatures moderate,some diseases may encroach on temperate areas(7).How can parasites be controlled? Some basic strategies such as sanitation and propercooking of foods are useful in combating all parasites.Other approaches may be useful for some parasitesbut not for others. Below is a brief summary ofmethods which have been investigated, and Table 3lists references which describe published researchinvestigating the efficacy of different methods asapplied to different groups of parasites. Sanitation and Hygiene - Proper disposal of human and animal wastes to prevent contamination of foods and drinking watersources is an excellent and basic strategy forpreventing many parasitic infections that aretransmitted by the fecal-oral route. However, inmany developing countries these wastes serve asfertilizer for crops. Composting of this materialcould kill parasite eggs. - Control of flies, cockroaches, and other insects may prevent dispersal of infective stages ofparasites to foods. - Thorough washing of raw vegetables and fruits may remove cysts, oocysts, and eggs of parasites,but it is difficult to adequately clean some leafyvegetables and berries.Table 2. Estimated cases of food- and waterborne parasitic diseases. Parasite U.S. (reference) Foodborne Parasites 5 Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madison- Frequent handwashing, use of clean utensils, and measures to prevent cross-contamination during food processing are also important. Animal Husbandry and Inspection - Husbandry practices that limit exposure of pigs to contaminated feed and feces have been successfulin developed countries in drastically reducinghuman infections with Trichinella and pork tapeworms. - Rodent control is also important to prevent pigs from consuming rodents carrying parasites. - Infected animals may be treated with drugs to kill parasites, and vaccines are being developed toprevent infections with certain parasites. - Inspection systems can detect parasites in pork, beef, and fish. These systems ensure that nearlyall meat reaching consumers in the U.S. is free ofparasites.Marination, Pickling, Smoking, Fermentation - Hot smoking processes kill Anisakis, but these parasites do survive cold smoking. - Marination of herring in 2.6% acetic acid and 8-9% salt kills Anisakis after 6 weeks, but 12 weeks are required if the salt concentration is5-6%. - Traditional Mexican methods of salt pickling of pork kill tapeworm larvae (cysticerci). - Fermentation of meat to produce dry sausages and ham inactivates both protozoa and larvae ofparasitic worms. Low pH and low water activitycombine to kill parasites so that less acidic productsmay require an a w<0.9 to be safe. Cooking and Heat Treatment All infective stages of parasites are destroyed by adequate cooking of foods and boiling of water.However, microwave cooking does not reliably kill Table 3. References on Control of Parasites Protozoa Trematodes Nematodes Cestodes Sanitation, hygiene ( Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madisonall parasites in meat and fish because heating is uneven and cooler spots may permit survival. Con-sumers are advised to cook pork and any wild gamethat may be infected with trichinae to an internaltemperature of 160\u00baF (71\u00b0C). Cooking fish for 10 minat 60\u00b0C or 7 min at 70\u00b0C will kill Anisakis (13;279). Freezing For food to be eaten raw, such as fish and some meats, freezing for several days can inactivate or killsome parasites. - Fish should be frozen at -30\u00b0C for 15 hours in a commercial blast freezer or at -20\u00b0C for7 days in a domestic freezer to kill Anisakis (184). Some other parasitic worms require longer or shorter periods at freezing temperatures. - Freezing meat at 5\u00baF (-17\u00b0C) for 20 days, -10\u00baF (-23.3\u00b0C) for 10 days (-29\u00b0C) for6 days destroys trichinae in pork (41;175 ), but this may not be adequate for trichinae in wildgame. Infective trichinae have been found in polarbear and grizzly bear meat frozen for 24 months(41;131). Filtration and Chlorination and Other Disinfectants - Filtration systems can remove protozoan cysts and oocysts from water. However, severaloutbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated withsurface water that had been filtered indicate thatthese systems are not always effective. - Chlorination eliminates bacteria and some parasites from water, but cysts and oocysts are resistant tochlorine. - Soaking of vegetables in a 1.5% bleach solution, vinegar, potassium permanganate solution(24 mg/L), or saturated cooking salt destroyedinfective nematode and trematodeparasites. However, viable trematodes weredetected in fish stored for a week in salt(3 g salt/10 g fish) at 26\u00b0C. - A 10% solution of ammonium hydroxide killed 94% of Ascaris eggs after 3 hours but other disinfectants were less effective. Other Physical Processes - Irradiation can destroy parasites on some raw foods. Lower doses of irradiation (0.5-0.7 kGy)damage larvae and inhibit infectivity, but largerdoses (6-7 kGy) are required to kill all the trichinaein meat. Irradiation doses of 0.1-0.15 kGy havebeen reported to kill trematode cysts in inactivate protozoan oocysts ( 282). - High hydrostatic pressure has been reported to be a potentially useful non-thermal method for killingAnisakis. - Ultraviolet light can disinfect water containing Giardia cysts. - Ozone kills protozoan parasites in water. - Ultrasound treatment inactivates Cryptosporidium oocysts in water. Life Cycle TargetsAnother approach to the control of parasites involves an examination the life cycles of parasites to findweak links where the cycles may be broken. Forexample, persons carrying adult tapeworms can betreated with anthelminthic drugs to eliminate adultworms that are producing eggs and thereby reducethe incidence of cysticercosis. Parasites spend some time in the environment as cysts or eggs but these are resistant to desiccationand other stresses. Fasciola cysts, for example, can survive in running water for as long as 122 days andin pasture for up to a year, and Giardia cysts cansurvive for months in cold water. Many parasites live in one or more animals during different stages of their life cycle, and control of theseanimals could potentially reduce parasite numbers.However, it is impossible to completely controlpopulations of wild animals and it is not practical toattempt to eliminate some intermediate hosts such assnails and small crustaceans from every water source.Some parasites can complete their life cycles in otheranimals, including domestic and wild carnivores andomnivores. For example, wolves, bears, and otherfish-eating mammals and birds can also serve asdefinitive hosts for the fish tapeworm, Diphyllo- bothrium, and there are reports that dogs ( 141) and bear (260) can serve as intermediate hosts for the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. Beavers and other wild and domestic animals can harbor protozoa infec-tive to humans. These animals act as reservoirs ofinfection and therefore proper treatment of humanwastes may not completely eliminate the threat ofthese parasites. http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdfFRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites 7 Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-MadisonLife Cycles of Parasites Parasitic worms usually have distinct larval and adult stages which often live in different species of animals.Animals that harbor the mature adult worms are calleddefinitive hosts; animals that harbor the immature,larval forms are intermediate hosts . Parasites may be present in other animals ( transport hosts ) but not undergo any growth or development in them. Someparasites have a complex life cycle involving severalhost animals. In other cases, an animal or human withpoor sanitary habits may directly reinfect themselves.Most parasites have a resistant, resting stage (eggor cyst) which can survive for long periods in theenvironment and may survive sanitizing treatments.Larval worms, embedded in meat, fish, or shellfish,are moderately thermotolerant and may not be killedby light cooking. Cells of parasitic protozoa vary somewhat at different stages of their life cycle. However, many donot have different definitive and intermediate hosts. Direct reinfection Parasite in intestine eggs or cysts in feces ingestion of eggs/cysts on contaminated hands,water, fresh or vegetables - Examples: Ascaris, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Giardia, Entamoeba Completion of life cycle in one host Consumed as encysted larvae in infected meat, theseparasites mature in the human GI tract, producelarvae which migrate to the muscles, and encyst. Theencysted larvae can only mature when the musclesare consumed by another host animal. - Example: Trichinella One intermediate host Snail/slug as only intermediate host Parasite in human intestine or lung eggs expelled in feces or sputum eggs hatch into miricidia (larvae) in water miricidia penetrate snails and undergo development: (1) larvae emerge from snails and encyst in water or on aquatic plants humans consume contami- nated water or plants - Examples: Fasciolopsis, Fasciola(2) humans consume raw or lightly cooked snails or slugs containing larvae - Example: Angiostrongylus Shellfish as host Parasite in human intestine cysts in feces depos- ited or washed into water cysts taken up by clams, mussels, oysters, etc. humans consume raw or lightly cooked, contaminated shellfish - Example: Cryptosporidium Mammal as only intermediate hostParasite in human intestine eggs or cysts in feces deposited in environment eggs or cysts consumed by pigs or cattle larvae or protozoa migrate to muscles humans consume infected meat - Examples: Taenia spp., Toxoplasma Two intermediate hosts Snails, crustaceans and fish as intermediate hostsParasite in human intestine or lung eggs released in feces or sputum eggs hatch into miricidia (larvae) in water miricidia penetrate snails and undergo development larvae emerge from snail and penetrate crustacean (crab, shrimp, or crayfish) or fish humans consume raw or lightly cooked fish crustacean - Examples: Paragonimus , Gnathostoma , Clonorchis /Opisthorchis Mammals intermediate hosts Parasite in human or animal intestine cysts in feces deposited in environment cysts consumed by pigs or other animals infected meat (e.g. pork) consumed by cats oocysts in cat feces oo- cysts inhaled or ingested by humans - Example: Toxoplasma Protozoan Parasites Intestinal protozoan parasites in humans typically cause mild to moderate diarrhea although malnour-ished children, the elderly, and the immuno-compromised may suffer prolonged and intensegastrointestinal symptoms that can be life threatening.Some protozoa can penetrate the intestinal wall http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdf8 FRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madisonand cause symptoms elsewhere in the body. Some infections are asymptomatic. Thick-walled cysts oroocysts are passed in the feces and may be shed forweeks after symptoms have subsided. Many protozoacan live and reproduce in more than one animalspecies but they do not grow or reproduce in foods orin the environment. Five of the most common para-sites will be considered here. -Cryptosporidium parvum Toxoplasma gondii belong Sporozoa group. They have no specialized structures forlocomotion and reproduce by both sexual andasexual multiplication. Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora are coccidian parasites that multiply both sexually and asexually within the humanintestine. Following sexual reproduction, theyproduce oocysts that are passed with the fecesand, when ingested by another human or animal,start another round of infection. The sexual cycleof Toxoplasma is confined to cats, which eliminate oocysts in their feces. In other animals, includinghumans, the ingested or inhaled oocysts excyst inthe small intestine and the resulting cells penetratethe intestinal wall and disperse through the body.They may have severe effects on newbornoffspring of infected mothers. These cells mayalso encyst in the muscles, heart, brain or othertissues and survive there for years. These encystedforms are also infective to other animals thatconsume meat containing them. -Entamoeba histolytica moves by means reproducesasexually. intestine. These cells may irritate the intestinallining, causing bloody diarrhea, and in some casesthey migrate to the liver or brain, causing abscesses(120). Humans appear to be the main host for this species. -Giardia lamblia has ingested in contaminated food or water, activetrophozoites are released, attach to the intestinalwall and reproduce. As few as 10 cysts may besufficient to cause prolonged diarrhea ( 201). Many wild and domestic animals also harbor Giardia.Some isolates from animals (livestock, dogs, cats,beavers, rats) are infective to humans while otherstrains appear to infect only animals ( 162).Toxoplasma Toxoplasma gondii may be the most widespreadof the human protozoan parasites, with up to 40%of persons in developed countries and up to 80% ofthose in underdeveloped areas of Central and SouthAmerica estimated to be infected ( 130). In places such as France where it is customary to eat some rawor lightly cooked meat, there is a higher incidence ofinfection. One survey found that 84% of pregnantwomen in Paris had been exposed to T. gondii before becoming pregnant as compared to 32% of pregnantwomen in New York. In most cases, infections areasymptomatic but consequences can be devastatingfor the immunocompromised and for the unborn chil-dren of women who become infected during preg-nancy (253 ). While a pregnant woman rarely notices that she has become infected, Toxoplasma can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The most commoneffect of such infection in children is diminishedvision or blindness after birth; more severe effectsinclude hydrocephalus, convulsions, and calcium de-posits in the brain. Toxoplasmosis is responsible forthe deaths of 10-30% of AIDS patients in Europe andthe United States and causes encephalitis in manyimmunosuppressed patients ( 130). Immunocompe- tent adults may also suffer symptoms of retinitis andenlarged lymph nodes after exposure to infected meator water ( 26;44). Two reviews describe the variety of effects T. gondii has on human health ( 22;253). There is not a lot of genetic diversity in T. gondii but three main lineages have been identified. Current research isseeking to delineate virulence factors and to determinewhether some strains are more virulent than othersor are more often associated with specific symptoms(2;16;25;32;65 ). T. gondii can infect virtually all warm-blooded animals, but only cats (both wild and domestic) serveas the definitive host and can excrete up to 800 millioninfective oocysts in their feces ( 64). A recent survey of cats at spay/neuter clinics in Ohio revealed that48% of all cats were infected with T. gondii, with ahigher incidence in outdoor cats (66 ). These oocysts can survive for long periods in the environment andmay be spread by the wind or by a variety of insectsand earthworms and contaminate foods ingested byhumans and other animals. Toxoplasma cysts that apparently washed into a reservoir in British Columbia http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdfFRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites 9 Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madisonafter heavy rains caused the largest reported outbreak of waterborne toxoplasmosis in 1994-1995 ( 26). At least 100 people had acute symptoms and twenty ofthose suffered retinitis of varying degrees of severity(28). It was estimated that several thousand people in the city of Victoria became infected during thisoutbreak but most were asymptomatic. Domestic andferal house cats and cougars in the area tested positivefor toxoplasmosis. At the time, the reservoir waterwas treated with chloramination but was not filtered. In animals other than cats, Toxoplasma cells migrate out of the intestine and encyst in muscletissue. These muscle cysts may persist for the life ofthe animal and are also a source of infection \u2014whether it be cysts in muscles of mice and wild birdsthat infect house cats or cysts in pork or mutton thatinfect humans. Pork has been considered the mainvehicle for exposure of humans to T. gondii. Seroprevalence rates among pigs, particularly younganimals, appear to have fallen during the past fewdecades ( 176) but some surveys still show a high prevalence of T. gondii infection in market-weight pigs (64). Some recent surveys of meat from grocery stores have demonstrated the presence of Toxoplasma in a greater proportion of lamb samples than in pork(12). Toxoplasma cysts are also found in meat of rabbits and some other domesticated animals but arerarely observed in beef or horse meat. Cysts in rawgoat's milk have caused human infections but bovinemilk does not appear to be a vehicle of infection. Surveys of wild animals suggest that up to 80% of black bear and white-tailed deer in the U.S. containT. gondii cysts in their muscles ( 130). Marine mam- mals also harbor Toxoplasma, and one possible source of infection in the marine environment includesshellfish which can filter oocysts from sea water.Raw, contaminated oysters could also cause humaninfections (170 ). T. gondii cysts in meat can remain viable for weeks at refrigeration temperatures (1-4\u00baC) but canbe destroyed by freezing at <-12\u00baC, heat >67\u00baC, andirradiation (169 ; Table 3) But oocysts spread in the environment by cats may be more difficult to controlas they can be a source of infection to cat ownerswho permit their cats to roam outside and oocystscan adhere to berries and vegetables that are eatenraw (158).Cryptosporidium During the past decade, numerous outbreaks ofcryptosporidiosis have been described. Details onseveral of these outbreaks are provided in Table 4.Perhaps the most infamous outbreak occurred inMilwaukee in 1993, where over 400,000 people suf-fered gastrointestinal symptoms and an estimated69 died. Fatalities occurred primarily among patientswith AIDS or other immune system disorders(87;137;179 ). Elderly persons also had an increased risk of severe disease (198 ). The total economic cost, due to medical costs and productivity losses, wasestimated at $96.2 million (50 ). Cryptosporidium can cause mild or severe symp- toms depending on the dose of oocysts ingested,the virulence of the strain of C. parvum , and the immunocompetence of the affected individuals ( 207). In healthy adult volunteers, the median infective dosewas determined to be 132 oocysts ( 68). Foodborne outbreaks of Cryptosporidium have been associated with raw produce apparently con-taminated by infected food handlers and cider andunpasteurized milk that may have come into contactwith cattle feces. Cryptosporidium oocysts can sur- vive on stainless steel surfaces for several hours andare resistant to a 5% bleach solution, indicating thepotential for cross contamination (59 ). Water containing oocysts can be a source of contamination when it is used for washing fresh fruitsand vegetables and when it is used as an ingredient inprocessing foods. When contaminated water wasused to make beer and a carbonated cola beverage,there was an 85% loss of viability within 24 hours.In contrast, only a 35% viability loss was observed inorange juice and infant formula made with contami-nated water ( 89). Oocysts can survive in fresh, brackish and salt water at 15 and 30\u00baC for several months and arereadily filtered out of the water and taken up byclams, oysters and other shellfish ( 77;88;103; 107;197). As yet, no outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated with shellfish have been reported butsurveys of shellfish from various bodies of waterincluding some commercial beds reveal thatCryptosporidium is often present (65-81% of sites or times sampled along the Atlantic coast) ( 79;80;102; 174). Cooking will kill these parasites, but those who http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdf10 FRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madisonprefer raw shellfish have another foodborne pathogen to be concerned about. C. parvum oocysts have also been detected in flies, and these may serve as a vector by transferringoocysts from feces to foods ( 109). An excellent recent review discusses detection methods and processing controls that may be usefulto the food industry in reducing or eliminating thisparasite from human foods ( 188). Attention should be focussed on a clean water supply, the possibility ofcontaminated raw ingredients, rodent and insect con-trol, and employee hygiene. Cyclospora Only recently was Cyclospora cayetanensis recog-nized as a cause of foodborne illness. Several large,multistate outbreaks associated with consumptionof imported raspberries occurred in the 1990s.Other outbreaks implicated salad greens, basil, orother berries as vehicles of infection (Table 5). Theserecent foodborne outbreaks are believed to haveresulted from the use of contaminated water inirrigating or in applying pesticides or fertilizers tocrops. When oocysts are first eliminated in feces oftheir host, they are unsporulated and are not immedi-ately infective. Therefore, it is thought that infectedfood handlers are probably not capable of transmittingthis disease. However, the environmental conditionsnecessary to induce sporulation are unknown and it ispossible that sporulation could occur rapidly undersome conditions. Cyclospora is endemic in many developing coun- tries where the lack of clean water and sanitaryfacilities facilitate transmission by the fecal-oral route.Some epidemiological studies have found an associa-tion between ownership of domestic animals andcyclosporiasis. However, humans are the only knownhost for C. cayetanensis . There is evidence that people living in endemic areas and eating local food developan immunity to Cyclospora . People may pass oocysts but experience no gastrointestinal symptoms ( 19). Cyclospora causes prolonged diarrhea that can be debilitating particularly in infants and the immuno-compromised ( 18;90). There have been a few reports of severe complications of infections includingGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (232 ) and reactive arthritis (Reiter) syndrome (46 is an important cause of diar- rhea in people in tropical and subtropical countries.Cases in the U.S. generally occur in immigrants,travelers returning from endemic areas, and in per-sons living in states along the border with Mexico.The closely related and morphologically indistinguish-able species E. dispar is also found in the human intestine but does not cause diarrhea. Some older dataon prevalence and epidemiology of E. histolytica mayTable 4. Recent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis. Location Year Vehicle of infection Cases Deaths Ref.

E. histolytica is the second leading parasitic cause of death (aftermalaria) and has been estimated to infect 50,000,000people worldwide of whom 40,000 to 100,000 dieyearly. Over one million cases of amoebiasis werereported in Mexico in 1996 ( 257). Many people exposed to E. histolytica remain asymptomatic but even these people may be sourcesof infection. Recent data from Mexico showed that340 asymptomatic carriers excreted an average ofnearly 4,000 Entamoeba cysts/g feces. Cysts from some of these persons were likely to have beenE. dispar but the large numbers of cysts produced indicate a significant potential for transmission ifsanitary conditions are inadequate. Males producedsix times as many cysts as females, and these cystswere significantly smaller ( 96). Studies in an endemic area of Bangladesh revealed that some children develop resistance to E. histolytica while others are genetically more susceptible to ame-biasis (119 ). These results indicate that it may be possible to produce an effective vaccine. The mucinlayer in the intestine inhibits attachment of the amoe-bae but if it is breached, Entamoeba may cause colitis and invade other tissues, particularly the liver(120;257). Invasive amebiasis occurs almost exclu- sively in adults and is reported to be up to ten-foldmore common in males ( 24;249). Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that contaminated drinking water is an important vehiclefor transmission in underdeveloped countries.Epidemics have occurred in developed countrieswhen there was a breakdown in a water purificationsystem or cross-contamination between sewage anddrinking-water pipes (17 ). Foodborne transmission is often associated with an infected food handler andalso occurs when produce is freshened or crops areirrigated with contaminated water. Flies, cockroachesand other insects may also transfer cysts from fecesto foods (163 ). Giardia According to the Centers for Disease Control, Giar-dia lamblia (intestinalis ) is the most commonly diag- nosed intestinal parasite and causes an estimated twomillion cases of diarrhea in the U.S. each year ( 38). Giardia cysts may be released in the stool for weeksand even months and may be present in concentra-tions as high as 10 7/g (202). Foodborne giardiasis can result from the use of contaminated water for irrigating or washing fruitsand vegetables. A survey, in the U.S. and CentralAmerica, of 25 samples of water used to irrigate foodcrops traditionally eaten raw revealed that 60% Giardia cysts seed sprouts tested in Norway; source of thecontamination in the sprouts was not the water usedfor sprouting but the unsprouted seeds themselves(235). Food handlers who are infected themselves or have had contact with the feces of infected childrenhave been implicated in some foodborne outbreaks.An outbreak in 1996 was traced to contaminated icecream, and poor personal hygiene was cited as acontributing factor ( 40). Prepared foods such as sand-Table 5. Reported foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis.

Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madisonwiches, salads, canned salmon, and ice have also been implicated in foodborne outbreaks (201;241 ). G. lamblia cysts have also been detected in flies thatmay serve as a vector for contamination of foods(109). Giardia cysts are present in surface waters, even in areas remote from significant human activity, andapparently originate from wild animals. (Giardiasis inbackpackers has been nicknamed beaver fever.) Cystshave also been detected in some groundwater samples(117), in well water associated with acute digestive disorders ( 100), and in water distribution systems in cities in Australia ( 52) and Canada (274 ). Giardia contamination of surface and well waters may origi-nate from wild animals, domestic animals and humansewage. Giardia cysts are highly concentrated in some cattle feces (5800 cysts/g) ( 127) although some strains of Giardia do not readily infect humans ( 9). Of 39 outbreaks of this disease associated withdrinking water reported to the CDC in 1999-2000,6 outbreaks, affecting 52 people, were traced to thepresence of G. intestinalis in inadequately treated well or river water or in water contaminated by crossconnections with pipes containing sewage or drinkingwater for animals was first recognized as a human diseaseabout forty years ago but became more familiar toU.S. consumers about 15 years ago when peopleoccasionally noticed live, wriggling worms in fish thathad been cooked in microwave ovens. The increasingpopularity of Japanese and other ethnic dishes con-taining raw fish has aroused more concern about fishparasites ( 246). Fish most commonly identified as vectors for Anisakis are chub mackerel and flying squid in Japan and pickled anchovies, raw sardines,cold smoked salmon, raw or pickled herring inWestern Europe and the U.S. Pseudoterranova infects cod causing losses of $26-50 million annuallyto fish processors in Atlantic Canada (184 ). Other fish, including whiting, mackerel, pollack, and floun-der, may also contain these parasites ( 13;86;221;222; 259). A survey of fish in a Belgian market revealed that approximately 11% were infected ( 221) while arecent survey of farmed salmon in Norway did notfind any infected fish ( 178). Some surveys have shown that the rate of infection with anisakid larvaevaries by season and increases with fish size ( 148). Water temperatures and seal populations may alsoaffect the abundance of these parasites ( 185). Dolphins and whales are the normal definitive hosts for Anisakis, and seals and sea lions are defini- tive hosts for Pseudoterranova . Adult worms in these marine mammals produce eggs that pass outwith the feces, hatch, and the larvae are consumedby shrimp. When fish or squid eat the shrimp, thelarvae are released, bore through the stomach wall,and may remain in the abdominal cavity or penetratenearby muscles. The life cycle is completed wheninfected fish or squid are eaten by marine mammals(184;243). Humans are an accidental host and these larvae cannot mature in the human gut. Instead the wormsburrow into the intestinal or stomach wall and maywander to the liver, lungs or other tissues, causinggastric disturbances and allergic reactions. In fact,some people who appear to be allergic to \"fish\" areactually allergic to Anisakis in the fish muscle ( 13). It should be noted that even if larvae are killed bycooking, this will not completely eliminate the poten-tial for causing allergic reactions in sensitive people(13;55;71;86;155;181;184;217 ). Ascaris Ascaris lumbricoides is a common infecting an estimated one-quarter ofthe world's population ( 116). In some areas without adequate hygiene, babies may become infected withinmonths after birth and the subsequent growth of theworms stunts growth and contributes to diarrhealinfections and early childhood mortality ( 53;192). Many infected adults do not exhibit symptoms al-though these worms are known to irritate the intesti-nal lining and interfere with the absorption of fatsand protein. In some cases, Ascaris causes more severe infections in the liver or lungs ( 154;242). Humans are the only known host for this round- worm. Eggs passed out with feces may be ingestedby the same or another person who drinks contami-nated water, eats with dirty hands, or eats uncookedvegetables that have been fertilized with contaminatedhuman wastes. Upon ingestion, the eggs hatch in the http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdfFRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites 13 Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madisonintestine and the worms may migrate to the lungs or liver before returning to the intestine and maturing.Techniques for the detection and enumeration ofAscaris eggs on vegetables have been developed and may be useful for screening fresh vegetables forcontamination ( 234). Angiostrongylus cantonensis and A. costaricensis (Rat lungworm) As the common name suggests, the normal definitivehosts of these parasites are rats and other rodents.However, individual cases and outbreaks of humaninfection with these parasites have been reported \u2014usually from Southeast Asia ( 157;264), the Pacific islands (215) or Latin America ( 161). Some individual cases have been reported from the U.S. ( 140;199), and an outbreak involving 12 American touristsreturning from Jamaica occurred in 2000 ( 252). Because humans are not a natural host, these parasitesdo not migrate to the lungs in humans but rather tothe tissues surrounding the brain where they causeeosinophilic meningitis (A. cantonensis) or they re- main in the abdomen causing severe intestinal upset(A. costaricensis). Usually infections are self limiting although some serious cases (37;224;281 ) and even deaths have been reported. The usual life cycle of A. cantonensis involves a snail or slug as intermediate host with the rat as finalhost. Infected snails and rats have been detected inthe southern U.S. and on many Caribbean islands(168). Sometimes freshwater fish, frogs, or crayfish serve as transport hosts. People acquire these para-sites by consuming raw or inadequately cookedinfected snails or transport hosts ( 264). In a New Orleans case, an 11-year-old boy admitted eating araw snail on a dare. Infected snails traversing lettuceleaves or other vegetables in the field may depositinfective larvae in their slimy mucus trails ( 250) or small infected slugs may hide amid the folds ofvegetable leaves and be eaten inadvertently. In thetourist outbreak a salad was epidemiologicallyrelated to infection ( 252), while mint leaves were implicated in a Guatemalan outbreak ( 161). Gnathostoma sp. Nematodes of the genus Gnathostoma cause a foodborne human illness characterized by creepingskin eruptions that are sometimes accompanied byerythema and local edema. Occasionally the wormsmigrate to the eye or other internal organs and maycause meningitis and other serious illness ( 15;171). This disease occurs primarily in some Asian and LatinAmerican countries although it has been reportedin the U.S. and Europe in travelers returning fromendemic areas in Asia and Africa ( 114;171;226 ). Sixteen such travelers were identified at a Londonhospital for tropical diseases during a twelve-monthperiod (41 ). Gnathostomes usually utilize two intermediate hosts. Adult worms living in wild or domestic catsand dogs release eggs with the host feces. Larvaehatch in fresh water and are ingested by small crusta-ceans that are then eaten by fish, frogs, or otheranimals. In these animals, the larvae migrate out ofthe gut and encyst in muscles. Consumption of rawor lightly cooked, infected fish, shrimp, frogs, etc.introduces the parasite into humans or other animals.Gnathostomes are active little parasites and migrateout of the gut to various tissues. In cats and dogs,they eventually migrate back to the stomach andcomplete their life cycle while in humans they oftenmigrate to the skin, causing a creeping eruption. Cases of gnathostomiasis in Japan have been traced to consumption of raw fish and shrimp (3;204) whilein Mexico and other Latin American countries,patients often report consumption of cebiche (ceviche),a dish made with raw fish (206;239 ). A survey of swamp eels purchased at markets in Bangkokrevealed that 74% contained gnathostomes duringthe rainy season while only season ( 258). Trichinella spiralis (Trichinosis) T. spiralis is a cosmopolitan parasite occurring in numerous carnivores and omnivores. Humans in theU.S. have traditionally acquired this nematode byeating encapsulated larvae in raw or lightly cookedpork. Improved swine feeding practices and regularinspections at slaughterhouses have drasticallyreduced the incidence of trichinae in raw pork in theU.S. During 1997-2001, only 17% of cases wereassociated with commercial pork and 13% of caseswere traced to non-commercial pork ( 41). However, a small percentage of commercial hogs, estimated at0.1% (175), still contain this parasite. Occasional large outbreaks still occur, reminding us to cookpotentially contaminated meat well. In 1990, 105 peoplein the U.S. contracted trichinosis in two outbreaks http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdf14 FRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madisontraced to raw sausage made from pork from com- mercial hogs ( 219). Commercially prepared raw sau- sage and contaminated ground meat were responsiblefor 52 case of trichinosis in Germany in 1998-1999(37). In some European countries raw horse meat, also a vehicle for infection ( 6), is an ingredient in traditional foods. Trichinosis in the U.S. is a notifiable disease and cases have steadily declined from the late 1940s whenthere was an average of 400 cases of overt illness peryear to 1997-2001 with an average of 14 cases/year(41). Some recent outbreaks have been traced to wild boar, walrus or bear meat ( 110), and wild game meat was reported to be the most common source ofinfection in the U.S. during 1997-2001 ( 8;41;131;270 ). Bear meat was responsible for five outbreaks ac-counting for 29 (40%) cases, and cougar and wildboar meats were associated with one case each.Wild game is a source of trichinosis in other countriesas well. At least 16 cases associated with walrus meatwere reported from Canada in 2002 ( 131). In Febru- ary 2003, an outbreak in Poland affecting at least124 people is believed to have been caused by infectedwild boar meat although other wild game might havebeen involved ( 216). Trichinella completes one round of its life cycle in one host animal. After infective larvae in meat areingested, they excyst in the intestine, mature, and anew generation of infective larvae is produced. Theyburrow out of the intestine and travel throughout thebody. Highest concentrations of larvae in pigs arefound in the diaphragm and tongue but they are alsopresent in various skeletal muscles. The encapsulatedlarvae may remain alive for many years, but oftenthey become calcified and die within 6-12 months.In order for the larvae to mature, the infected musclemust be eaten by another carnivore. Parasitic Worms \u2014 Trematodes Clonorchis/Opisthorchis (Liver flukes) In eastern and southeastern Asia, several related para-sitic worms of the genera Clonorchis and Opisthorchis lodge in the liver of infected humans and other ani-mals causing blockage and hyperplasia of the bilepassages. Light infections may cause mild symptomsof liver dysfunction while heavier infections result inhepatitis and digestive disorders. Several epidemio-logical studies have demonstrated a significant asso-ciation between chronic infection with these liverflukes and a type of liver cancer, cholangiocarcinoma(277). Liver flukes have a complex life cycle involving two intermediate hosts, snails and fish. Humans andother fish-eating animals complete the life cycle byeating raw, infected fish and digesting out the cysts.Then the larvae migrate to the liver, mature, andproduce eggs. Traditionally, cases of this disease have been confined to Asia. The parasites have been detected infish, cats and other animals in most Asian countriesand also in Siberia, Kazakstan, the Ukraine, andGermany. With the influx of Asian immigrants toAustralia and other Western countries since the 1970s,human infections with liver flukes have been diag-nosed in numerous countries where the disease is notendemic (57 ). Liver flukes are unlikely to become an established or widespread problem in the U.S. However, theseparasites may be present in immigrants from Asiancountries and there is a potential for contaminatedfreshwater fish to be imported from endemic areas. Fasciola hepatica (Liver fluke) F. hepatica is a well-known parasite of domesticated ruminants causing significant economic losses in thecattle and sheep industries of some countries(124;156;210 ). Human cases usually occur in parts of countries in South America, North Africa and theMiddle East where sanitary facilities are inadequateand clean water is not available. In some areas ofBolivia more than 60% of the local population isinfected, and a large outbreak affecting 10,000 peopleoccurred in Iran in 1988 ( 75;182;238). Human out- breaks and cases may occur where this parasite is alivestock problem but also occur in areas where theanimal parasite burden is low ( 182). People in devel- oped countries are also occasionally infected if saladgreens have been contaminated ( 112;139). Disease symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, weight loss and enlarged liver. Some evidence sug-gests that heavy or chronic infections of this parasiteare associated with liver tumors ( 124). Experimental data demonstrated that Fasciola infections in mice can cause an increase in mutations in nearby livercells (98). http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdfFRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites 15 Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-MadisonAdult Fasciola inhabit the liver, producing eggs that pass out with the feces. The eggs hatch in water, larvae penetrate snails and undergo further develop-ment before leaving the snail and encysting in wateror on vegetation in or near the water. During rainyspells, cysts may also be present on field plants suchas dandelion leaves. Fasciola cysts can survive in running water for as long as 122 days, in pasture forup to a year, and even for a few months in hay ( 124). Humans often become infected from eating water-cress (112;139) and a variety of other plants (75;124 ) growing near contaminated fields and from drinkingcontaminated 70;135). Fasciolopsis buski (Fasciolopsiasis, Intestinal fluke) F. buski is the largest trematode infecting humans, with adult worms typically 8-10 cm long. Wormsmost commonly inhabit the intestines of farm pigsand school age children in Asian countries. Anemia,headache, and gastric distress characterize mild in-fections while heavier infections cause severe ab-dominal pain, malnutrition, edema, and sometimesintestinal blockage. This parasite requires a single intermediate host. Eggs are deposited in feces, hatch in water, and thelarvae penetrate snails and undergo development.After 4-6 weeks the parasites emerge from thesnails and encyst in water or on aquatic plants. Con-sumption of contaminated water or of raw aquaticvegetables allows for completion of the life cycle(108). This parasite is not likely to be a problem in the U.S. except among immigrants and foreign travelers.Contaminated vegetables that might be imported fromendemic areas would probably be dried or canned andboth processes would destroy the parasite. Paragonimus (Lung fluke) Nine species of the trematode Paragonimus reside in many parts of the world, including North America,and infect the human lung and occasionally othertissues, including the brain. Symptoms of diarrhea,abdominal pain, and fever may occur early after in-fection and progress to coughing and thoracic painas the worms settle in the lungs. Infections are some-times initially misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, whichcan delay effective treatment ( 196;267).The life cycle of this parasite includes two or more intermediate hosts: a freshwater snail, then acrab or crayfish, and sometimes an animal which eatsthe crabs and then is consumed by humans. Theworms can mature only in humans and some wildcarnivores. When other mammals, such as wild boar,consume infected crabs, Paragonimus cannot com-plete its life cycle but migrates to the muscles andencysts. If humans consume infected boar meat, theworms emerge from the cyst and migrate to the lungswhere they mate and produce eggs. Most commonly, people become infected by eat- ing raw or pickled crabs, including a Chinese delicacycalled \"drunken crab\" ( 47;54;147 ). But some cases been traced to undercooked wild boarmeat (196;245), and undercooked guinea pig meat is believed to be a vector in some South Americancountries (132 ). Many of the cases diagnosed in the U.S. occur in immigrants who were already infectedwhen they came to this country or continue to eatimported raw crustaceans (187 ). Cases acquired in the U.S. have been traced to consumption of rawcrayfish ( 58;225). Neither pickling nor salting adequate cooking will make crabs, crayfish and meat safe to eat. Parasitic Worms \u2014 Cestodes Taenia spp. Tapeworms of the genus Taenia may be the most familiar of foodborne parasitic worms, with adultsmeasuring 3-5 meters in length in the intestine ofhuman hosts. Three species are of primary concernto humans and all have intermediate stages in impor-tant domestic animals: Taenia saginata in cattle and Taenia solium and Taenia asiatica in hogs. There have been reports that other mammals, includingdogs and bear (141;260 ), can serve as intermediate hosts for T. solium, reindeer can harbor T. saginata, and goats and monkeys can harbor T. asiatica ( 29). Although Taenia spp. are cosmopolitan, modern sanitary facilities and animal husbandry practices indeveloped countries have greatly decreased risk ofinfection ( 265). However, in some regions of the world these parasites are a significant problem.T. solium , in particular, may be present in as many as 20% of hogs (resulting in loss of productivity) http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdf16 FRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-Madisonand causes debilitating human disease that is difficult and expensive to treat (72;134;220). Taenia life cycles involve two mammalian hosts. Adults in the human intestine may live for more thantwenty years, producing several thousand eggs dailythat pass out with the feces. If these are consumedby an intermediate host, they develop into larvae(cysticerci) which migrate to the muscles. Consump-tion of raw or inadequately cooked, infected beef orpork introduces the larvae into the human intestinaltract where they mature into adult worms. Infectionsmay be asymptomatic or may generate non-specificcomplaints such as altered appetite, abdominal pain,diarrhea or constipation. Humans may also serve as the intermediate host for T. solium (but not for T. saginata or T. asiatica ). When T. solium eggs are ingested via dirty hands or fecally contaminated vegetables, larvae hatch in thesmall intestine and travel to various tissues and organsin the body where they encyst causing cysticercosis.Some studies report that up to 40% of carriers ofadult worms also have cysticercosis, indicating thatfecal-oral transmission, either directly or via contami-nated food or water, is common. Use of untreatedurban sewage sludge on pastures may cause cysticer-cosis in cattle or hogs while untreated human wastescontaining T. solium eggs, if used as a garden fertil- izer, could cause cysticercosis in humans (29 ). The most serious consequences occur when the larvae reach the brain, causing neurocysticercosisthat often triggers headaches, seizures, and otherneurological symptoms (93 ). This is the most com- mon parasitic disease of the central nervous systemand is a major concern in some areas of Latin America,Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe ( 83;94;200;203; 205;223). Even in the U.S., where infection with adult tapeworms is relatively rare, more than 1000cases of neurocysticercosis occur each year ( 31). Most cases are diagnosed in immigrants from en-demic areas, and approximately 10-12% of emer-gency room visits for seizures in southern Californiaand New Mexico were due to this disease. Casesacquired in the U.S. can sometimes be traced tocontacts with immigrants, including cooks, infectedwith the pork tapeworm, who long associated withcultures that consume raw or lightly cooked fish(231). At present, human infections are most com- mon in Finland, Scandinavia, Alaska, Canada, Japan,and Peru ( 61). Humans are one of the primary definitive hosts and the adult tapeworm may grow to a length of tenmeters in the intestine. Eggs pass out with feces,hatch in water, and the larvae are eaten by a copepod.Fish that eat copepods become infected and then passthe parasites on to humans who eat raw fish. D. latumis widely distributed in pike and, to a lesser extent, inwalleye and yellow perch in central Canada and hasalso been found in fish in northern Minnesota andnorthern Michigan. Trout and salmon may carry thelarvae of D. latum in South America but not in North America. Some other species of Diphyllobothriumhave been isolated from salmon in Japan and Alaska.Wolves, bears, and other fish-eating mammals andbirds can also serve as definitive hosts for somespecies of Diphyllobothrium . Their feces will contain parasite eggs that can wash into lakes or streams. Usually the presence of one worm causes no symptoms but many worms can cause abdominalpain, diarrhea, and anemia. Humans cannot serve astrue intermediate hosts for this parasite (as is the casefor the pork tapeworm). However, consumption ofwater containing newly hatched larvae or infectedcopepods can give rise to a condition called spargano-sis. The ingested larvae penetrate the intestinal walland migrate to tissues just under the skin causingsome discomfort before they die. Echinococcus spp. The adult stage of this tapeworm lives in dogs, foxesand other canids and intermediate stages normallyinfect sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle. Humanscan also serve as an intermediate host if they ingesttapeworm eggs in contaminated water or on raw,contaminated vegetables. The larval tapeworms formfluid-filled cysts (called hydatid cysts) in the liver,lungs and other organs of intermediate hosts. Tissuedamage may be severe in some cases ( 106;262). This disease is endemic in some areas of northAfrica, Asia, the Middle East ( 5;263), and Mediterranean countries ( 152;248) and occa- sional cases seen in the U.S., usually amongimmigrants. http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdfFRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites 17 Prepared by M. Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. October 2003 Food Research Institute \u00a9University of Wisconsin-MadisonSummary Parasites do not cause as many outbreaks of foodborne disease in the U.S. as viruses and bacteria. However,even though they are less common, some parasitescan cause severe illness in elderly or immuno-compromised individuals and others can have seriouseffects even in the immunocompetent. The organismsmost likely to be of concern in sidered in this review are uncommon in temperateclimates and in areas with good sanitary facilities.However, there is the potential that some of themcould be present on imported foods or in foods pre-pared by infected food handlers. With increasinginternational travel, there is also the possibility ofexposure to these parasites in other countries. Although the incidence of trichinosis has decreased in the U.S. there are still some infected pigs and pigscan also carry Toxoplasma . Therefore, proper cook- ing of pork remains important. In addition, wild gamecan be an important source of both of these parasitesand should be well cooked. Freezing of wild gamemeat cannot be relied on to kill parasites. Taenia solium , the pork tapeworm, is seldom detected in pork in the U.S. It poses the most dangerto humans when the eggs are ingested and the larvaetravel to the brain causing neurocysticercosis. Theissue here is not the proper cooking of pork butsanitation \u2014 proper disposal of human wastes, cleanhands, and washing fresh fruits and vegetables thatmight have been contaminated with feces containingtapeworm eggs. Raw fish can contain Anisakis and some other less common parasites and, if it is to be eaten raw,should first be frozen to kill the parasites. There is apotential risk that raw shellfish will contain protozoanparasites, such as Cryptosporidium . Elderly and immunocompromised persons should avoid or bevery cautious about consuming raw meat, fish, orshellfish. Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora are all spread by the fecal-oral route and therefore sanitaryprocedures will aid in preventing transmission. How-ever, these parasites may also live in a variety ofdomestic and wild animals and outbreaks have oc-curred even in developed countries where sanitarysystems for human wastes are adequate. Untreatedsurface waters may contain these parasites and fruitsand vegetables may contain resistant oocysts or cystsof these parasites if they are washed or irrigated withcontaminated water. Proper cooking of meat and fish and washing of fresh fruits and vegetables \u2014 which are standardprocedures for preventing other foodborne diseases\u2014 will also be effective in killing or removing para-sites from foods. Several other procedures, includingfreezing, irradiation, UV light, and ozonation, mayalso be useful in killing some parasites. http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdf18 FRI BRIEFINGS: Foodborne Parasites Prepared by M.

Ellin Doyle , Ph.D. Food Research Institute, UW-Madison Cryptosporidium strikes over 400,000 people in Milwaukee! Cyclospora causes diarrhea in more than 1,000 residents of the USA and Canada ! Such dramatic outbreaks have enhanced our awareness of the potential for food- and waterborne microbes to affect large numbers of people in the USA. According to the latest World Health Report , \"Almost half the world's population suffers from diseases associated with insufficient or contaminated water and is at risk from waterborne and foodbornediseases, of which diarrhoeal diseases are the most deadly\" ( 1). As these recent outbreaks demonstrated, the USA is not an island and our citizens are also vulnerable to food- and waterborne pathogens. What are these unfamiliar organisms and where have they come from? Parasitic protozoa are not common in developed countries. Few people, even in the medical establishment, knew much about Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium until recently. At one time it was thought that Cyclospora was a blue-green alga because it appeared to share some structural and chemical features with this group of prokaryotes. Later observations revealed thatCyclospora is a eukaryotic organism related to the coccidian parasites Cryptosporidium and Isospora and more distantly related to the microsporidia Septata and Enterocytozoon . Although some of these protozoa were isolated long ago from a variety of animal hosts and a few were known to cause human diarrhea in some tropical countries, it hasonly been during the past few decades, with the increase in numbers of immunocompromised persons (transplantpatients, those undergoing chemotherapy, and AIDS victims) that they have become widely recognized as significantcauses of human diarrhea. As recent outbreaks have demonstrated, however, immunocompetent individuals are also atrisk for infection. All of these protozoa have a similar life cycle and are likely disseminated by some variation of the fecal-oral route, possibly involving contaminated water and food ( 2). When the oocysts (infectious stages) of Cryptosporidium , Cyclospora , and Isospora are ingested by an individual, they pass to the small intestine where they excyst, releasing sporozoites. These cells invade the enterocytes (epithelial cells lining the small intestine) and undergo a cycle ofasexual reproduction to form merozoites. When the merozoites are released from the enterocytes, they disperse toinfect other intestinal cells. There may be one or many cycles of this type of asexual reproduction and then a cycle ofsexual reproduction producing gametes. Fertilization results in the formation of oocysts, which are then passed outwith the feces. In some protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium , the oocysts are immediately infective to another host while in others, e.g. Cyclospora and Isospora , the oocysts must mature for several days or longer before becoming infective. Infectious stages of Septata and Enterocytozoon are called spores. When these are ingested and reach the small intestine, the spore contents are injected directly into an enterocyte. These parasites then multiply within the host cellsand carry on many cycles of asexual reproduction. Eventually spores are passed out with the feces and are ready toinfect another host ( 3). Depending on the age and immune status of the host, the number of spores or oocysts ingested, and the pathogenicityof the parasites, these protozoa can cause asymptomatic infections, a self-limited diarrhea (usually lasting about 2 or 3weeks), or a prolonged, severe diarrheal illness which may persist for months. Experiments with healthy human APPENDIX reprint of FRI Briefing, November 1996 Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdfvolunteers demonstrated that a dose of only 30 Cryptosporidium oocysts was sufficient to induce an infection in some persons, although some others who received higher doses did not develop infections ( 4). It has been hypothesized that invasion of the intestinal cells stimulates the release of cytokines which activate phagocytes. These cells then release soluble factors which increase intestinal secretions of chloride and water, thereby causing symptoms of diarrhea.Cryptosporidium is the best studied of this group of parasites, but some fundamental questions concerning its pathogenicity remain, such as the possible production of an enterotoxin. Although the small intestine is the main siteof infection, in some heavily parasitized patients, especially in the immunocompromised, the colon and liver may bealso be affected. Dissemination to other parts of the body has only been observed regularly with Septata. Surveys to determine the prevalence of oocysts in stool samples generally report a higher incidence of infection in persons from Asia, Latin America, and Africa than in those from Europe and North America. Cryptosporidiumprobably causes the greatest percentage of cases of diarrhea associated with these protozoa and has been linked tooutbreaks involving contaminated water in the USA ( 5-7) and England ( 8) and to outbreaks involving contaminated food and drink ( 9,10) as well as to cases of acute childhood diarrhea in developing countries, traveller's diarrhea, and chronic diarrhea in AIDS patients. Although only a small number of adults in developed countries have detectableoocysts in their stool specimens, antibodies to Cryptosporidium have been detected in 32-58% of population samples in Western countries ( 1). Therefore, many people in these countries have been exposed to this parasite during their lifetime. The other protozoa have been reported to cause diarrhea, at a lower frequency, in the same groups of people.All of these organisms are frequent causes of diarrhea in AIDS patients. In such patients with chronic diarrhea, 10-20% are infected with Cryptosporidium and 6-50% are or Enterocytozoon . Isospora infects approximately 15% of Haitian patients with AIDS but only about 0.2% of U.S. patients. This probably reflects ahigher prevalence of isosporiasis in the general population in Haiti as compared to the USA ( 1). Since the infective stages of these protozoa are present (at concentrations as high as 1,000,000/gram) in feces, sometype of fecal contamination is responsible for new cases of diarrhea. Person-to-person transfer may occur in familiesand institutional settings such as daycare facilities. In a 1995 outbreak in Minnesota, chicken salad was apparentlycontaminated with Cryptosporidium by a food handler who operated a home daycare and had recently changed an infant's diaper. Although the infant was asymptomatic and the woman had washed her hands before preparing thesalad, enough oocysts were transferred to the food to cause illness in more than half of the estimated 50 personsattending a social function ( 10). Water contaminated with oocysts (probably originating from animals) was responsible for the massive outbreak ofcryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee ( 5) and for smaller outbreaks affecting 70-100 people in Nevada ( 6) and Florida ( 7) and for an outbreak of cyclosporiasis in Chicago ( 11). Cryptosporidium oocysts have also been isolated from cider made from apples which had fallen on the ground in a cow pasture ( 9) and from raw vegetables in Costa Rica ( 12). Cyclospora oocysts (of unknown origin) on fresh berries were apparently responsible for an outbreak of diarrhea in Florida in 1995, and Cyclospora on raspberries imported from Guatemala was implicated in the 1996 outbreak in the USA and Canada ( 13,14). However, current methodology was not sensitive enough to detect oocysts on fresh fruit associated with these outbreaks. A variety of analytical approaches have resulted in the development of severaldifferent assays for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water ( 15), and a PCR assay that can detect as few as 1-10 Cryptosporidium oocysts in 10 mL of milk has been devised ( 16). Efforts are underway to modify these assays so that low concentrations of Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora oocysts can be detected in foods. Cryptosporidium is notorious for its lack of host specificity, with most isolates from mammals capable of infecting many different mammalian species. In fact, a number of waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in developedcountries have resulted from contamination of drinking water sources with runoff from agricultural lands whereinfected cattle have grazed. Animal reservoirs are not well known for other parasitic protozoa. Cyclospora oocysts, identical to those observed in human samples, have been isolated from fecal samples from baboons and chimpanzeesin Africa ( 17). In addition, the investigation of the Chicago Cyclospora outbreak indicated that rodent or bird feces may have contaminated the drinking water supply for a dormitory. No cross connections between water and sewagepipes in the building were detected. But the drinking water, stored in a rooftop tank, was not adequately protectedfrom the environment, and animal feces were observed on the rim of the tank. Cyclospora has also been isolated from stool specimens from members of a Peruvian family with diarrhea and from ducks bred by the family ( 18). Although it is not clear that all of these Cyclospora isolates are the same species, the zoonotic transmission of Cyclospora is a APPENDIX reprint of FRI Briefing, November 1996 Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/parasites.pdfdistinct possibility. High temperatures are known to be lethal to these protozoa and therefore boiled water and adequately heat-processed foods should be safe to consume. Recent experiments evaluating the efficacy of high-temperature-short-timepasteurization treatments demonstrated that heating to 71.7\u00b0C for 5, 10, or 15 seconds was sufficient to destroy theinfectivity of Cryptosporidium oocysts suspended in water or milk ( 19). However, oocysts are more resistant to cold and freezing temperatures ( 20). Oocysts suspended in water retained their infectivity after 168 hours storage at +5\u00b0C and at -10\u00b0C. At colder temperatures, infectivity was destroyed: at -15, -20, and -70\u00b0C, no infective cells remainedafter 168, 24, and 1 hour of storage, respectively. Cryptosporidium oocysts are also notoriously resistant to chlorination, as seen in outbreaks involving chlorinated drinking water. Laboratory experiments demonstrated thatoocysts suspended for up to 2 hours in 1.31, 2.63, or 5.25% aqueous sodium hypochlorite were still infective to mice(21). As these data demonstrate, it is possible to eliminate Cryptosporidium and probably other oocyst- and spore-forming protozoa from food and water with appropriate conditions of heat and freezing. However, viable oocysts and sporespersist in contaminated foods that are eaten fresh, such as fruits and salad ingredients, and in contaminated drinkingwater. Chlorination will not destroy the oocysts in water, and filtration systems may have an inadequate pore size toexclude oocysts or may become clogged or overwhelmed during certain seasons, such as spring, when snow melts andrains may be heavy. Although much research has been devoted to Cryptosporidium , methods for its control and elimination are not yet adequate. Further research is also necessary to refine methods for the detection of the otherprotozoa and to determine conditions necessary to destroy their spores and oocysts. References 1. WHO.
