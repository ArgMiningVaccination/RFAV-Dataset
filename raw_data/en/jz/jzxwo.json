You or your loved one can choose a facility that offers various levels of on-site care services, a smaller care community that features a homelike setting, or even a facility that identifies with a specific cultural background. There's also an abundance of resort-style assisted living communities in Los Angeles, especially in areas like Beverly Hills and in the heart of Los Angeles. Combined senior care Many of A Place for Mom's assisted living communities in Los Angeles offer on-site memory care services, which cater to residents who have Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia. These communities offer uniquely structured environments, highly trained caregivers, and specialized cognitive therapies. When seniors choose an assisted living facility that also offers memory care services, the specialized services may be offered in the same residence, in another wing of the facility, or in a different on-campus building. The benefit of choosing such a facility is that seniors don't have to worry about moving to a different community should their cognitive care needs change. Residential care homes Los Angeles also has many assisted living options that offer a more relaxed and homelike setting, which differs from larger facilities. Often referred to as board and care homes or residential care homes, these assisted living options provide the same level of assistance in a residential home. The difference is that that these homes typically house fewer residents, meaning each senior is able to receive a more personalized level care in an intimate setting. Cultural communities Some areas in Los Angeles have assisted living communities rooted in different faiths and cultures. For example, there are several Jewish assisted living communities in the Beverly Hills area offering Kosher-certified kitchens, Jewish cuisine, and religious services. Some are also located near synagogues and churches for seniors who wish to practice their faith outside of their assisted living facility. Los Angeles also has assisted living communities inspired by East Asian cultures, some of which are located in or near Little Tokyo. Resort-style assisted living There are many highly sought-after Los Angeles neighborhoods where seniors can find luxurious amenities combined with the daily care they need. Often nestled among high-end shopping districts, upscale dining establishments, and highly rated medical centers, these Los Angeles assisted living facilities have much to offer. Start each day with a chef-prepared, gourmet meal in a restaurant-style dining venue. Then, take a dip in an outdoor swimming pool or attend an exercise class in a professionally supervised fitness center. Join new friends for an afternoon high tea, or pamper yourself in an on-site beauty salon and barber shop. Many of these communities are also pet-friendly, so residents can treat their furry friends to a spa session at the dog wash station or take them on a stroll through the pristinely landscaped grounds. Some of Los Angeles' resort-style communities even offer perks such as a limousine service and personal shoppers. "}
