Recent publications have explored single-dose intranasal (i.n.) adenovirus-based vaccines as an effective strategy for curbing SARS-CoV-2 in na\u00efve animal models. However, the effects of prior immunizations and infections have yet to be considered within these models. Here, we investigate the immunomodulatory effects of Mycobacterium bovis BCG pre-immunization on a subsequent S-protein expressing i.n. Ad vaccination, termed Ad(Spike). We found that Ad(Spike) alone conferred long-term protection from severe SARS-CoV-2 pathology within a mouse model, yet it was unable to limit initial infection 6 months post-vaccination. While i.n. Ad(Spike) retains some protective effect after 6 months, a single administration of BCG-Danish prior to Ad(Spike) vaccination potentiates its ability to control viral replication of the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant within the respiratory tract. Though BCG-Danish had no effect on the ability of Ad(Spike) to generate and maintain humoral immunity, it promoted the generation of cytotoxic and Th1 responses over suppressive FoxP3+ TREG cells in the lungs of infected mice. These data demonstrate a novel vaccination strategy that may prove useful in limiting future viral pandemics by potentiating the long-term efficacy of next generation mucosal vaccines within the context of the safe and widely distributed BCG vaccine.
