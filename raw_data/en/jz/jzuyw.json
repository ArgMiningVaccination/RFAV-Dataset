Over a 40 year period he compiled his book Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica) which contains more than 1,800 drugs with 1,100 illustrations and 11,000 prescriptions.-Treatment with TCM is highly personalized, based on a patient's current state of yin and yang (The Four Natures), the Five Tastes and the Meridians. Unlike in western medicine, many times the efficacy of the treatment is believed to be based upon the balance and interaction of the combined ingredients, rather than on specific constituent being the cure.- In the Four Natures, each herb has a quality of hot or cold (yin/yang) associated with it, in which it can be used to balance out a person's own yin/yang state.- The Five Tastes consist of sweet, sour, bitter, salty and pungent, each of which has its own set of features and effects. - The Meridians involve which organs the herbs effect, which in turn have their own set of elemental qualities associated with them (wood, fire, earth, water and metal).

Preliminary results also show dan shen has potential efficacy against HIV. Some studies also show that the traditional preparation of the medicine exceeds the activity of the purified compounds, leading to possibly more bioactive minor metabolites orsynergistic effects.
