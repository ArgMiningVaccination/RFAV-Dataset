Jabs are under way for teenagers in some countries. But this pandemic is having a silent and devastating impact on children. [orphaned](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3135605/indian-children-struck-grief-loss-and-guilt-many-lose?module=inline&pgtype=article). Countless others lived in fear that this would happen to them. And it still might. [Delta variant](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3144722/delta-variants-global-spread-raises-question-will?module=inline&pgtype=article)infections washed onto Asia in May, a [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01253-8/fulltext)in The Lancet found that globally, more than 1.5 million children had already experienced the death of a primary carer or grandparent who lived in their home. Imagine what that's like for a child, living with the trauma of losing a parent to this disease. This virus does not discriminate. Yet the pandemic is having an unequal impact on people who can't access vaccines because richer countries have taken the lion's share. It's affecting children whose parents can't afford to stay at home so the virus is brought in through the front door. In Asia, both infections and deaths are higher than most could have imagined possible when the disease first broke out. Around 54 million people have been infected. Many have been hospitalised with serious and long-lasting health effects. Total lives lost from Covid-19 across Asian countries are creeping towards 1 million. [recent study](https://elifesciences.org/articles/69336#s2)from researchers at Hebrew University and University of T\u00fcbingen. [rising death toll among children](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/3135992/coronavirus-malaysia-death-toll-passes-3000-singapore-says-sorry-after?module=inline&pgtype=article)and young people. Many have died even though early last year many thought that children, at least, were safe. Initially, it was critical to focus on protecting older people, but as Covid-19 threatens further waves of misery across Asia, we must look after both young and old in the race to contain this pandemic of a century. Amid low vaccination rates, this year's tragic Covid-19 surge across Asia left children exposed in crowded homes, while enduring lengthy lockdowns and online schooling. [Bangladesh](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3143285/coronavirus-child-brides-bangladesh-teens-forced?module=inline&pgtype=article), schools have only recently reopened after 18 months. [still closed](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3150718/singapore-and-malaysia-philippines-teachers-say-online?module=inline&pgtype=article). Children are remarkably resilient and can bounce back after disasters. Yet the immense strain on the mental health of young people caused by the pandemic must not be underestimated. [mental health effects](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3134681/coronavirus-hong-kong-children-experienced?module=inline&pgtype=article)are not yet clear. But it is of great concern that studies across multiple countries already show increased mental health disorders for children during this pandemic, according to a recent British Medical Journal [paper](https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1730). The evidence also suggests that children who had prior mental health disorders were at increased risk of pandemic-related mental health trauma. Young adults have also been hit hard by this crisis. We also need to focus more on supporting teenagers and young people through this pandemic. [Give Asian youth a voice to decide their post-pandemic future](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3151527/asian-youth-hard-hit-covid-19-pandemic-should-have-voice-decide?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) [study](https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/young-people-s-concerns-during-covid-19-results-from-risks-that-matter-2020-64b51763/)from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that about 50 per cent of young people have experienced a job-related disruption either themselves or via a household member. The study also showed that close to two-thirds of young people are worried about their financial security and well-being. [\"long Covid\"](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3144236/what-long-covid-shortness-breath-fatigue-and?module=inline&pgtype=article)- are a growing concern as infections in young people have skyrocketed across Asian countries that are easing restrictions. [analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95565-8)of 15 studies and nearly 48,000 adult Covid-19 patients who contracted the disease last year found that 80 per cent experienced longer term symptoms including fatigue, headache and attention disorder. [study](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021)released in April. Vaccinations appear to offer millions of people in Asia a bright light at the end of this long, dark Covid-19 tunnel. But some countries are still languishing because they just can't get enough doses, and this is placing more children in peril. Indonesia and Vietnam still have less than 25 per cent of the population fully vaccinated whereas Bangladesh has just 11 per cent and Myanmar 8 per cent, according to Oxford University's Our World in Data. Richer countries have bought enough doses to vaccinate their populations, and many are now administering booster jabs, while people in Asia are still at risk of dying from a lack of vaccine access. Children are suffering in this pandemic and we are only just starting to realise how much.
