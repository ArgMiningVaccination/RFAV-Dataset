To this day, only the United States has completed successful manned missions there. They sealed its victory over the then Soviet Union in the Space Race, which had begun in the mid-1950s between the two Cold War superpowers. In the early years, however, the Soviet Union had been in the lead: In 1957 Sputnik 1 became the first satellite to go into orbit around the Earth; in 1961 Yuri Gagarin became the first person to travel into space. That rivalry has since given way to co-operation. The International Space Station is a project run by the space agencies of the US, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. Scientists from around the world come together up there to conduct experiments.SCIENCE 264898 001Apollo Astronauts - The Best of the BestNeil Armstrong was the first man to set foot on the moon in 1969.

Human eyes can differentiate between more than seven million colors. Human skin has thousands of sensors that detect sensations and relay information to the brain. The human brain can store the same amount of information as 20,000 dictionaries. All these statistics show that the human body is quite rightly regarded as a miracle. And not all human capabilities can be expressed in numbers.264781 005What Makes Some of Us Strong? Why does one person emerge stronger from a crisis, and another cracks under the strain? Why do some people know how to turn failure to their advantage, while others do not? The capacity to cope successfully with stressful situations such as failure, misfortune and emergencies is what researchers call resilience. But where does such strength come from? Is it something we are born with, or can we acquire it through learning? Documentary, 30 min., 2011, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; LR 264781 006The Secret of Healing Powers A baby is bor n and survives that doctors think does not stand a chance. A paralyzed cellist returns to the concert stage, even though that is said to be out of the question after four brain operations. Both recoveries were only possible because doctors were prepared, alongside modern medicine, to put their faith in the power of self-healing. Documentary, 30 min., 2011, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; LR264781 001Little Conquerors - How Babies Discover the WorldIn the first three to four years of their lives, children accomplish incredible feats of learning. They set out to explore and conquer the world. They aim to make contact with their counterparts from the first moment. Children are naturally inquisitive, and learning is an almost automatic process - providing they grow up in a stimulating environment in which they feel safe. For a long time, scientists thought conscious communication only began with language. But pre-linguistic contact with the world is the very first stage of all communication and learning. Documentary, 30 min., 2011, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; LR 264781 002The Ego... What is it?Is human consciousness just a neurochemical process? If so, what does that mean for the idea of free will or the human subject or self? Does modern brain research show that it is not the self that decides what we think and want, but rather chemical and physical processes in the neurons? Some philosophers reject such theories. They point to the impact that consciousness can have on the nervous system, for example in the case of the placebo effect. Documentary, 30 min., 2011, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; LR 264781 003How Our Muscles Influence Our LivesUntil now, the 640 muscles in the human body were viewed as components of a highly complex system, but also as passive command receptors. But new research shows that the fibers play a much more important role. Muscles emit a large number of transmitters, most of which have not yet been properly analyzed, and communicate with other organs. Documentary, 30 min., 2011, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; LR The Mysteries of the Brain The brain is the nerve center of the human body. It is the point where all information from the body and its environment is collected and processed into reactions and memories. Everything we think, say or do is controlled by the brain, as are processes that occur without our conscious input, such as understanding what we are seeing or hearing, feeling joy or fear, or recognizing danger. Researching the workings of the human brain is an even greater scientific challenge than decoding the human genome. 264762 001 The Brain Pacemaker Deep brai n stimulation is a treatment that can provide therapeutic benefits to people who have Parkinson's. The method involves placing electrodes at the heart of the afflicted region of the brain via a small hole drilled in the skull. These electrodes restore order to neural activity via electrical pulses. They are connected to a pulse generator implanted below the clavicle or in the abdomen via insulated wires that run beneath the skin. Documentary, 30 min., 2010, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR 264762 002 How We Learn The brain n ever stops learning. It is probably more flexible than we ever imagined. Experiments have shown that when it comes to absorbinginformation and making decisions, young people are not always at an advantage. Evidence that evolution has programmed the brain to learn is provided by its own internal reward system: learning makes you happy and content, right through to an advanced age. Documentary, 30 min., 2010, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR264762 003 Nerve Center for MovementWe need our brain to think and learn. But it is also responsible for controlling our movements. We learn to control our movements through the cerebral cortex. Later, when those movements have become so automatic that we execute them without having to think about them, other regions of the brain take over. But it is not just a case of the brain affecting our movements, movement itself also has an influence on the performance of the brain. Documentary, 30 min., 2010, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR 264762 004 Understanding Pain Increas ing numbers of people suffer from chronic pain. Latest studies show that such pain is an acquired behavioral pattern, like a program that has been stored by the brain. And once a pain memory has affected the nervous system, it is not easily erased, even with medication. Documentary, 30 min., 2010, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LRSCIENCE264762 005 Sleep as a Source of Energy We need sev en to eight hours of sleep every day. Sleep can have an enormous impact on our quality of life. If you have slept well, you are likely to be active, receptive and healthy. And regular, adequate sleep appears to be especially important for the brain. The reasons for this have not been fully explained, but experiments show that when we do not get enough sleep, our memory capacity is greatly reduced. Documentary, 30 min., 2010, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; LR 264762 006Conquering Fear Fear is an in stinctive protective mechanism, which is often activated without our conscious input. For example, we jump to the side when a car gets too close. This instinctive reaction is key to our survival. Fear can result in high performance, during an examination for example, but it can also leave you paralyzed. The situation becomes critical when fear gets so out of control that it suddenly turns into panic. Scientists are exploring ways to conquer fear. Documentary, 30 min., 2010, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; LR 264762 007What Makes a Person Evil? Violent c rime often leaves us speechless with incomprehension. How are such deeds committed? What occurs in the minds of the perpetrators? Are the mechanisms that trigger such actions similar in all those who carry them out, or are they very different? Neuroscientists have found some surprising answers to these questions. Documentary, 30 min., 2014, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR 264762 008 Doping for the BrainIn a bid to enhance their performance in various activities, many people use prescription drugs developed to treat health problems. That holds not only for physical performance but also for mental functioning. But does 'brain doping' really help? What is certain is that it has negative side effects and can inflict long-term damage. Documentary, 30 min., 2014, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR264762 009 Invisible, But Highly Effective: Our Thoughts We can use ou r thoughts to control devices and move artificial limbs. Our thoughts even have the power to heal disease. But what are thoughts? Mere brain waves, or something more? The latest neurological research shows that thoughts and feelings belong together, that they influence each other and cannot be understood independently of each other. Documentary, 30 min., 2014, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD; LR 264762 010 Neuromarketing - Tracking Our DecisionsHow does a person decide what to spend moneyon? Do commercials influence behavior? When do ads elicit the intended response, when are they ignored? Neuromarketing deploys psychological and neurological research to answer such questions. For the advertising industry and its clients, the answers are of huge significance and value in developing new strategies. Documentary, 30 min., 2014, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; LR 264762 011How Scientists Manipulate Our Memories Scientists are looking for ways to erase terrible, distressing memories in order to help people over - come crippling fear. Neuroscientists have discovered that a certain enzyme is involved in longterm fear memories and are seeking to control its activity. Might this mean a ray of hope for traumatized people? Or is it a risky path for society to take? Documentary, 30 min., 2014, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR 264762 012 Puberty - The Brain's State of Emergency Puberty i s often a challenging time in a family's life; for both parents and the youngsters themselves. During this phase of growing up, boys and girls watch their bodies change and experience accom-panying mood swings. They have to accept that their childhood is coming to an end and that they're maturing into young men and women. Puberty begins in the head. This is because certain zones of the brain give the green light for an interplay of hormones that fundamentally alters the body.

Sometim es, after someone has broken the law, he or she might say, \"I don't even know why I did it.\" We tend to think that is just an excuse because we humans are in fact always in charge of our actions. But neurologists see it differently. Not only have they discovered that this assessment is way off the mark, they have also found out why some people commit serious crimes. These findings are forcing society and the judiciary to rethink how to call criminals to account and punish them; but also how to help them find their way back to leading a normal life again. Documentary, 30 min., 2018, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, M, IFE, LR 264762 014 Always On Duty - When the Brain Needs a Break Our infor mation society - packed as it is with smart- phones, tablets and computers - is making ever-greater demands on our brains. Time pressure and too much work can make people ill. Studies show that multi-tasking is ineffective and inefficient: The more tasks someone takes on, the slower he or she becomes and the more prone to making mistakes. Have we reached the point where our brain can no longer process the information coming its way? The answer is yes, say some neurologists, sociologists and IT experts. They recommend: Rebuild your attention span, take breaks, and insist on the right to turn off digital devices. Some go a step further and say: Rather than us adapting to the devices, it's the devices that should be adapted to our needs.

We know less about them than we do about the moon. There are many reasons why researchers are making a concerted effort to gather information about the world's oceans. Concerns include the safety of global shipping traffic, the protection of marine plants and animals, and the search for natural resources. Comprehensive data are urgently needed if ocean resources are to be managed sustainably. And there is much to suggest that the oceans play a key role in the causes and consequences of climate change. Science on the Seven Seas reports on research projects about the mysteries of the deep.264749 004Dangerous Beauties - The Mysterious World of the JellyfishJellyfish reside in all ocean waters, from coastal regions to the deepest seas. Their life-cycle is characterized by extreme transformations. And although some species of jellyfish number among the seas' most deadly inhabitants, their sheer variety and beauty are a source of fascination. Jellyfish are effective hunters and an important food for many marine animals. Zoologist Gerhard Jarms has been investigating the jellyfish for years.

Documentary, 15 min., 2009, SD; English, Spanish; LR SCIENCE124666 001 Absolute and Relative It's all a question of perspective! EinSteinchen provides a simple example revealing how size - depending on your point of reference - is actually relative. 124666 002 E=mc \u00b2 Einstein's famous formula! EinSteinchen explains that energy can turn into mass, while mass can likewise be converted into energy. This second process, for example, constantly occurs in our sun. 124666 003 The Discovery of SlownessWhat is the 'relativity of time'? EinSteinchen shows how time changes when traveling through space. Of course, speed also plays a role. An external observer watching a clock on a spacecraft that was accelerating through space could see time 'slow down' as the ship gained speed. 124666 004 As Fast as LightEinSteinchen explains that light always moves at the same speed, and why nothing can be faster than light.124666 005Glowing Atoms - Stimulated EmissionsHow does a laser apparatus create its special, highly concentrated beam of light? EinSteinchen explains the role that 'excited' atoms play in the process. 124666 006 The Supermolecule - Bose-Einstein CondensationWhen EinSteinchen drops the temperature of molecules close to absolute zero, they change state and begin behaving like a single 'wave'. 124666 007 The Spooky Long-Distance EffectEinSteinchen takes a look at a paradox. Two particles can continue to be 'entangled' with each other even if they're far apart in space. 124666 008 Bent SpaceEinSteinchen shows how incredibly massive objects exerting enormous gravity actually bend space, and how even light follows the curve. 124666 009 Dancing ParticlesMolecules are in constant motion. Even inanimate particles can move in seemingly unpredictable ways. EinSteinchen explains how the forces that play a role in interactions between molecules can be defined by formulas. 124666 010 Electricity from LightLight can exhibit the characteristics of either a particle or an electromagnetic wave. That's why light energy can be converted into electrical energy. EinSteinchen shows us how. 124666 011 The Invisible ForceEinSteinchen reveals how the forces of gravity e xerted by stars and planets keep everything in the universe in motion. 124666 012 WormholesTheoretically, two black holes could distort space-time in the universe so extremely that they would create what's called a 'wormhole'. EinSteinchen explains how a theoretical journey through this kind of cosmic tunnel could provide shortcuts across the enormous distances of space.E=mc\u00b2 - the most famous formula in the world. Everyone knows it, but very few know what it actually means. This is true of most of Albert Einstein's revelations. You don't have to be a genius in physics to under-stand our program. Whether it's the photoelectric effect or the relativity of time, the virtual figure EinSteinchen will help you understand the ideas behind Einstein's work in a simple and straightforward fashion. In twelve 90-second, elaborately animated clips, the virtual whiz explains the great scientist's most important discoveries. EinSteinchen speaks directly to viewers, and makes them want to learn more about the basic principles inherent in Einstein's theories. He explains difficult concepts using amusing and fascinating examples that anyone can understand. 124666 Animation, 12 x 90 sec., 2005, SD;Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Indonesian, Macedonian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish WW, VoD, M, IFEEinSteinchen SCIENCEEinSteinchen 124665 005 The World's Fastest FlashLaboratories all over the world have been taking part in a competition to create shorter and shorter flashes of laser light. Now physicist Ferenc Krausz has broken a new barrier. He's first to produce an attosecond pulse. An attosecond is an unimaginable 0.000 000 000 000 000 001 of a second long. The technique that Krausz used is based on Einstein's prediction of stimulated emission. The great physicist's hypothesis helped lay the foundations for the development of that incredibly versatile tool - the laser. 124665 006 Juggling Ultra-Cold AtomsThough he's just 32 years old, Immanuel Bloch is already a professor of physics at the University of Mainz. He's an expert on a state of matter that was predicted by Albert Einstein - Bose-Einstein condensation. Immanuel Bloch has now taken things a step further. He has become the first to crack the Bose-Einstein condensation wave and regularly arrange several hundred of these special atoms into a glowing grid. In the future, grids like these could make up the basic elements of a new kind of supercomputer. 124665 007 Cloned Atoms Through Teleportation For the first time ever, Rainer Blatt was able to transfer the state of one atom to another. Although the process is called 'teleportation', no matter is transported from one spot to another. Instead, information leaps the gap. To achieve his goal, Blatt made use of what Albert Einstein described as the 'spooky action-at-a-distance between particles'. The discovery is a scientific sensation, even though the teleporting distances crossed up until now have only been a few hundredths of a millimeter.124665 001Nuclear Medicine: A Formula and its ResultsWhen an atom in a radioactive element decays, then part of the matter that makes up its nucleus is transformed into energy. This is part of the proof that backs up Einstein's realization that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. Without Einstein's discovery that is expressed in the formula E=mc\u00b2, some later medical developments would not have been possible. Artificially produced radioactive substances known as radiopharmaceuticals play a major role in modern medical diagnostics and research. 124665 002 Satellite Navigation - Einstein's Contribution to GalileoTime is relative - in the field of satellite navigation, Einstein's theory has practical applications. In space, clocks tick differently than they do on Earth. But the accuracy of satellite navigation systems is depen-dent on how precisely the atomic clocks on board can measure time. 124665 003 The Speed of Light - Part 1: Light ResearchersAt the root of Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity is the assumption that the speed of light never changes. Einstein said that the speed of light is a universal constant, one that always remains the same no matter where you are. Is that really the case? European researchers now want to conduct an experiment in space to find out. 124665 004 The Speed of Light - Part 2: Radar SatelliteThe speed of light also standardizes the exact length of a meter. That's important for large-scale surveys like those slated to be carried out by the radar satellite TerraSAR-X. The rader satellite will begin surveying Earth's surface with an accuracy never before seen in civilian applications. The new satellite, for example, will be able to map the ongoing urban sprawl of some of the world's largest cities. 124665 Clips, 12 x 03-05 min., 2005, SD;Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, Greek, Hindi, Indonesian, Macedonian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish WW, VoD, M, IFESCIENCE124665 011 The Search for a Theory of Everything For much of his life, Albert Einstein sought a formula that would describe and encompass all four funda-mental forces. He failed to find a unifying theory. The tunnel in Geneva is huge - and it runs in a circle that's 27 kilometers long. Thousands of scientists allover the world are waiting with bated breath for experiments to begin in the Large Hadron Collider. It's hoped that the gargantuan apparatus will be able to generate a kind of small scale Big Bang, lasting for just fractions of a second, that will recreate the conditions just after the birth of the universe. 124665 012 Time Travel Through Wormholes - Nothing More than a Dream? As early as 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen recognized that relativity theory did not rule out 'bridges' through space-time. Today, we call these hypothetical pathways 'wormholes'. Physicists nowadays admit that time travel through wormholes is at least theoretically possible, although journeys into the past or future have remained firmly in the realm of science fiction. 124665 008Cosmic Telescopes: Discovering Distant Galaxies According to a theory first put forward by Albert Einstein, a large body of mass curves space and the light that traverses it. Clusters of galaxies create what are known as gravitational lenses. Astrophysicist Joachim Wambsgan\u00df has spent years studying this phenomena in deep space. He searches and maps massive celestial objects such as galaxies that possess strong gravitational fields. These curve or bend the space around them, and force light from even more distant galaxies and objects into a curved rather than a straight trajec-tory. The process also 'bundles' the light, focusing and increasing its intensity. 124665 009 Racing down Einstein's Paths Molecules in gas and fluids tend to behave in unor-dered and random ways. This phenomenon, first identified by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown and therefore named Brownian Motion, was also of great interest to Albert Einstein. In 1905, he published his studies on Brownian Motion. Today, his findings can help researchers solve many of the problems linked to the movement of particles. 124665 010 Organic Solar Cells What a pain: the cell phone has to be charged at the mains every few days. But in future that could be rendered obsolete by a portable charging unit in a jacket. It consists of wafer-thin organic solar cells. Like conventional silicon cells, the organic solar cells convert light energy into electrical current. The principle behind it is the photoelectric effect. Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his explanation of this phenomenon.

We may imagine economic developments are happening somewhere \"out there\", but in fact we are in the midst of them the entire time. How do they affect our lives? What happens on the financial markets? What do free trade agreements mean for us? We look for the answers to such questions in Inside Economics.

Only the well-informed can make responsible purchase decisions, though some manufacturers would prefer us all to be blissfully ignorant: For them, an awful lot of money is at stake.

Many have experienced terrible things as refugees and live in a precarious situation in a new country. But here on the soccer pitch, they can forget about their worries for a few hours. Their laughter rings out over the field and, after scoring a goal, they all hug each other, regardless of where they come from, whether they're refugees or were born here. And where is this wonderful place? In the Lebanese capital Beirut. And the kids are taking part in 'Soccer Camp Lebanon'. Leb anon has more refugees relative to the size of its population than any other country. Here Syrian refugees live alongside Lebanese locals and Palestinian refugees who were forced to leave their homes decades ago - sometimes in close proximity. This has created a volatile situation that requires a variety of strategies to build tolerance and mutual trust if social conflict is to be avoided. 'So ccer Camp Lebanon', a nationwide tournament for children and young people, is an initiative of Germany's Goethe Institute and coaches at a local soccer school. Based on faith in the conciliatory power of soccer, it gives 900 youngsters from Beirut and three other Lebanese cities the chance to play soccer together, to escape from their everyday lives and gain new perspectives in the process. At training sessions in mixed teams - boys and girls from Lebanese, Palestinian and Syrian families - and a closing tournament, the children have the opportunity to explore their cultural and social commonalities and differences. Bei rut Parc - Kids Seeking Refuge in Football observes the young people and explores the impact of the soccer camp on their daily lives. The program provides an insight into how the youngsters and their families live in Lebanon - either as locals or refugees - and what role soccer can play in developing new perspectives and the foundation for a peaceful coexistence.Beirut Parc Kids Seeking Refuge in Football WORLD ISSUES\"People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,\" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences. Any one who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn't the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that \"The Greed Program,\" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We se t off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values. 884865 Documentary, 90 min., 2016, HD; English, German; WW, VoD, M, IFE 884866 Documentary, 52 min., 2016, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; WW, VoD, M, IFE 884867 001, 884867 002 Documentary, 02 x 45 min., 2016, HD; Arabic, English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M, IFEGreed A Fatal Desire WORLD ISSUESThe Rich, the Poor and the Trash Trash is a symbol of our times. The amount we generate and the way we deal with it speak volumes about our consumption patterns and level of prosperity - and also about social inequality. The rich consume much more than the poor and produce much more waste. But what some people throw away, others need to survive. God win Ochieng lives in Dandora, a poor suburb of Nairobi, Kenya, where one of the largest dumpsites in Africa is located. He spends his days combing through endless piles of garbage, brought in by the truck-load from the city's wealthier districts, in the hope of finding something to sell: for him, the mountain of trash is a lifeline. Meanwhile, halfway around the globe in one of the world's richest and most expensive cities, Pierre Simmons combs the streets of New York for cans he can sell to recycling companies. Both men live in countries where the gap between rich and poor is vast. But the economic and social disparities between the US and Kenya are also huge. Economists Lucas Chancel and Kate Raworth warn against the consequences of huge imbalances at both the national and international levels. They argue that they poses a great danger to our entire system of values, to our understanding of democracy and to our economy. 864905 Documentary, 30 min., 2018, HD Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEWORLD ISSUES 884903 Documentary, 45 min., 2018, HD Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEJudith Kerr, Aeham Ahmad, Saa Stanii, Nneka Egbuna and Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta come from four different continents and have one thing in common: They all fled war, hardship or persecution and started over in a new and unfamiliar place. Culture became their key to integration. Books, films and music helped pave the way. \"Is n't it wonderful to be a refugee?\" ten-year-old Judith Kerr shouted across the rooftops of Paris in 1934. She and her family had fled Nazi Germany one year earlier. Escape was a great adventure for her, and her parents didn't let her sense their fear. Today, the world-famous writer (\"When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit\") lives in London and says: \"For me, England was my home at the end of the war. But it wasn't for my parents. They never belonged anywhere.\" It's a story typical of many refugee families. Aeh am Ahmad, \"the pianist amid the rubble\" of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, keeps wondering why he of all people survived while so many others didn't. Saa Stanii has become a renowned German-language author after fleeing the Bosnian War in 1992 at the age of 14. Musician Nneka Egbuna who fled the violence in her family in Nigeria as a teenager, lives in Lagos, Hamburg and Paris but isn't truly at home anyplace - \"home\" to her is a feeling. Author Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta was no longer allowed to work at home in Chile after Augusto Pinochet's coup d'etat in 1973, and lived in exile in West Germany.After the Escape Finding a Home in a Foreign Land WORLD ISSUES 864843 Documentary, 06 x 30 min., 2015, HD;English WW, VoD, M, IFELife Links Sharing Realities, Changing Perspectives Life Links sheds light on issues that affect young people around the globe: on what holds them back, what cramps their style and how they nonetheless manage to master their lives. In each episode three Life Links reporters meet young people in different parts of the world.

Alina lives on the outskirts of Paris, France and has always experienced rejection because she is a Roma. Amin in Cologne, Germany considers himself German, though his roots are Egyptian. He is always confronted with people who insist on knowing where he is \"really\" from. 864843 002 Drug Trap - Breaking FreeGilda from Bolivia would much rather be a teacher than a coca farmer. She is forced to pick the leaves from which cocaine can be made. Dominik from Germany started taking drugs when he was a teenager and his life went downhill from there. Now he's in prison for aggravated assault. Emma hasn't had a sip of alcohol for three years. But even now that she's sober, she still struggles because her fellow Finns like to drink a lot. 864843 003Deal with Me - Seeking AcceptanceDavid is proud to be Jewish. As the stigmatization of minorities seems to have become socially acceptable in his native Hungary, he is trying to fight the trend. Ali has been a refugee almost all his life. Hoping for a future without discrimination, he left Iran and fled to Germany where he's struggling for acceptance. Leonidah lives in Kenya and has albinism. People with her condition face persecution and discrimina - tion. Yet Leonidah wants to be accepted for who she is and what she looks like. 864843 004 Blame My Parents - Bearing the BurdenIn Romania, Andrea has to take care of her younger sister all by herself. Their mother lives and works in western Europe, so she can support her family. Jean Claude in Rwanda doesn't know his father. His mother, an ethnic Tutsi, was raped by several Hutu militiamen during the genocide in 1994. Robin in Germany was still a student when his father died. His life changed from one day to the next when he had to take over the family business. 864843 005 For Christ's Sake - Ordain Me!Jacqueline from Germany feels called to Catholic priesthood. The only problem: she's a woman. Petrus is a member of the Suriyani, a Christian minority in Turkey. He wants to become a priest, but his religion isn't officially recognized in his country. M is a Methodist in the United States and believes that sexuality and gender are fluid concepts. She feels called to the ministry but has been turned down by her church. 864843 006 Head Above Water - Call of DutyShips make for some of the toughest workplaces on earth. It's hard work, long hours and little pay. Paul comes from a family of fishermen, but he's one of the last young men wanting to do the job in Germany. Jeroen from Holland, like his colleagues, faces countless obstacles: shipwrecks, piracy, dangerous working conditions and lots more. Alamgir works with his bare hands to dismantle ships in Bangladesh - a dangerous and backbreaking profession. But he has no choice but to keep going.

What do we now know about the machinations of those involved, kept secret from the public for decades after the end of the conflict? What were the crimes that one simply didn't speak of, even if one was aware of them? What were the events that historians were only able to find out about years after they happened? New facts are coming to light all the time, whether about espionage, diplomatic contacts or economic ties. Classified: World War II tells the stories from this terrible war that aren't common knowledge.364900 004Hitler's Mountain of TreasuresGeorge Clooney's The Monuments Men relates a Hollywood version of efforts by the Allies towards the end of World War Two to find and recover art treasures stolen by the Nazis. One trove the Nazis were about to destroy so it would not fall into the hands of the victors was rescued at the last moment. But who was actually responsible for saving the works?

So they thought up a disinformation manoeuver, Operation Mincemeat. It involved the body of a dead man dressed up as a British officer with misleading fake documents in his pockets. The Germans fell for the ruse.

He provided Stalin with reports on the war plans of the Axis powers. The fact that Stalin didn't always believe him cost the lives of millions of people. As for Sorge's own life, when he was arrested in Tokyo, Moscow did nothing to save him.

But even as early as 1931, Japan attacked and occupied the Chinese territory of Manchuria. The pretext was a staged event, which became known as the Mukden Incident. The secret operation and disinformation campaign was devised and led by a Japanese military officer named Ishiwara Kanji, who was probably acting independently of the government.

Banks in neutral Switzerland earned a fortune converting the gold into foreign currencies, which the Nazis then used to acquire raw materials. The banks have never been held to account for their actions.

Our protagonists lead us back to where they spent their teenage years, places were German and European history was made. The personal stories of young people at six different milestones in German history show that the role young people play in a society says a great deal about that country's attitude towards freedom and democracy. Teaching young people respect for human rights, freedom of speech and tolerance is a vital cornerstone for the peaceful co-existence of different peoples. 324851 0061961: Reinhold Gr\u00fcningStill in high school, he wants to help a friend escape from the GDR.

German prosecutors believe former high-level intelligence agent Josip Perkovic was responsible for at least one of the killings, and he's now been indicted in Munich. In a documentary as exciting as any spy thriller, Philipp Gr\u00fcll and Frank Hofmann look into this and other cases.

There were attempts at support - for example, the hunger strike by some 300 prisoners at a Stasi prison after martial law was proclaimed in Poland. But there were few direct contacts. Our film tells the stories of opposition activists then and now.

The British military government opened the camp for German refugees and returning soldiers in September 1945. Today, Friedland is a reception center for asylum seekers and refugees. Many have abandoned everything back home and risked their lives to reach Europe. We accompanied some refugees during their stay in the camp and also talked to people who came to Friedland in the early days. All had dramatic stories to tell. \"When I meet children from Syria or elsewhere in Friedland today, I am always meeting myself,\" says Annelie Keil, who arrived there as an eight-year-old child in 1947. How different are the feelings, experiences and aspirations of the people in this place where so many decades of escape stories intersect?

The Dong Xuan wholesale market in Berlin's Lichtenberg district is like a mini-version of Hanoi in Germany. The stalls are a meeting place for East and West, Germans, immigrants, tourists and locals alike. \"Dong Xuan means spring meadow,\" explains Mai-Phuong Kollath, who came from Vietnam to the former East Germany as a contract worker in 1981. Here she buys fresh herbs for her spring rolls. Retailers like Raghbir Singh buy clothes wholesale here. He arrived in West Berlin from Punjab as a student in the summer of 1989. The Sikh is now a grandfather. His children and grandchildren were born in Berlin and only know a unified Germany. Businessman Suat Bakir was eight years old when he arrived from Turkey with his parents. \"German reunification was like a wedding to which the immigrants were not invited,\" he says. We also meet Elisa Dosse from Mozambique, who lives with her husband in the eastern German city of Dessau. One of her best friends was murdered by neo-Nazis in 2000. They all have their own stories to tell, and all of them are closely linked to Germany. We visit them at home, in Dessau, Hamburg and Rostock, and accompany them to a place where Germany is exotic and different: a place that feels and smells like home.

The Inner German Border 524730 002 Making of \"Walled in!\"To recreate the border region in as much detail as possible, animators generated more than 130,000 images from historical models, in a high-definition computer process that took some 100,000 hours to complete. Every object had to be created as an individual graphical element using polygon shapes. The Church of Reconciliation, located in the death strip, for instance required some 500,000 polygons. The Making of Walled in! tells the backstory of the striking animation, including the intensive effort required to build a virtual replication of the Berlin Wall. Documentary, 11 min., 2009, SD; Arabic, English, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; WW, VoD, M, IFE524730 001 Walled in!The computer animation, depicting the Berlin Wall and the border between East and West Germany, illustrates the oppressive reality of the border region as it seeks to answer the question: \"What was the Wall really like?\" Toda y, only fractions of the no-man's land and the Wall itself remain. The computer animation connects the dots - making the perils of the border region visible. For the first time, historians and television producers have created a detailed reconstruction of the no-man's land as it looked at the start of the 1980s, including new views of the border fortifications. With s tartling imagery, the animation recreates what was once a divided Germany for those who know it today as just another piece of distant history, helping younger generations better understand the suffering of people in Berlin and throughout Germany, divided for decades by the border between East and West.

Few people know that G\u00f6tz took the decision of a lifetime at the age of 21. He left his family, his home, and his country, the German Democratic Republic. Falko G\u00f6tz tells the whole story of his flight and its consequences. Did he find the freedom he was looking for? 564713 002 Flight to FreedomThree brothers, three escapes, three incredible stories. Ingo, Holger and Egbert Bethke fled East Germany one by one in dramatic style.

When it was almost on top of the craft, the pilot pulled the nose up and turned away. The three men in the boat thought they had made it and continued heading north-west towards Denmark. What reads like a scene from an action novel was a daring escape bid that took place in 1986.564713 004Veiled PlansAs the daughter of a diplomat, Kerstin Beck saw more of the world than most East Germans. She lived in Iraq and Vietnam, and went to Soviet-occupied Afghanistan as an exchange student when she was 23 after hatching a plan to cross the Hindu Kush and enter Pakistan. From there, she was able to fly on to West Germany. 564713 005 Risking EverythingWhen Berit Gei\u00dfler was 21, she and her family escaped the GDR by hiding in the back of a caravan belonging to a holidaying Swiss couple. They then crossed from what was then Yugoslavia to the West, with Berit locked into a water tank and her husband and baby sewn into a mattress. 564713 006 Escape Through the SewersDieter Wohlfahrt was 15 when he left the GDR and moved to West Berlin. Years later, he took advantage of the fact that his Austrian nationality allowed him to cross between West and East Berlin to help East Germans escape through the sewerage system. During a rescue attempt in 1961 he was shot and killed by GDR border guards. Karl-Heinz Albert was with him at the time. He's never come to terms with his friend's death.

Twenty years on, most of the inhabitants were still there, but their lives had been transformed. This epic report from deep in the heart of the former GDR provides fascinating insight and is compelling as a study of personal hopes and fears, joy and suffering.The Berlin Wall was one of the most infamous symbols of the Cold War and the division of Germany. For some people living behind the Iron Curtain, the pull of the West was so strong that they were willing to risk their lives to cross the heavily guarded border between East and West Berlin. Hundreds were killed trying to flee, but many others managed to make it to the West by using ingenious and spectacular methods of escape. The Promise of the West 564713 Documentary, 08 x 30 min., 2008, SD;English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, IFE, MHISTORY It was Hitler's invasion of Poland that triggered World War Two in Europe. This assault by National Socialist Germany, which contravened interna-tional law, began on 1 September 1939 when German troops entered Poland without warning. It ended on 6 October that same year when the last remaining Polish forces capitulated. The co mmonly accepted theory is that the war began when the German warship Schleswig-Holstein shelled a Polish garrison on the Westerplatte peninsular in the city of Gdansk. In fact, however, a German air force bomber squadron had already reduced the small Polish town of Wielun to rubble. The to wn's unsuspecting residents were taken by surprize as they lay sleeping in their beds. Wielun was a town without any military presence or strategic importance. It was almost completely destroyed in three bombardments. Hitl er's Assault is without precedent in television history. It is the first German-Polish co-production to document the events that started World War Two. The bombing of Wielun forms the dramatic framework of the film, which is told from both sides - German residents of the border region and soldiers on the one hand, and Polish eyewitnesses on the other. 70 years on, they talked about their personal recollections of how the war began. Renowned historians also discuss the events of August and September 1939.Hitler's Assault How World War II Began 364738 Documentary, 02 x 30 min.,2009, SD;Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, MFake, Stolen - Sold! 364854 001 Great Masters, Easy Prey - Spectacular Art Thefts and ForgeriesThe list of spectacular raids on museums and galleries is a lengthy one.

Crooks sometimes threaten to destroy paintings or sculptures if their demand for cash isn't met. Another misleading clich\u00e9 is that of the forger as bril - liant artist.

Cultural buildings can serve as such spaces. A great number of museums, opera houses and arts centers are currently being built, especially in China. The structures are often spectacular and aim to give the cities a unique face. This approach is giving rise to a great number of bold and distinctive buildings in Asia, setting the architectural tone for the 21st century.

The perpetual influx of people is driving the skyline upwards, and transit systems are struggling to cope. Buildings are erected in every available space. A new kind of urban planning is needed. In the Chinese city of Ningbo, for example, a residential complex of 200 homes has been constructed in layers, to promote the establishment of neighborly relations. New cities are being built today in the hope they will attract millions of people in the future. Public buildings, central squares and residential districts have all been laid out, though no one knows whether these ghost towns will ever evolve into vibrant metropolises. Documentary, 30 min., 2015, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LRAsia's cities are growing at a fast and furious pace. In some regions, within just a few years fishing villages have become megacities with millions of inhabitants. Urban structures have barely had time to evolve in the process: many cities have no center, no appropriate infrastructure, and no discernible identity. Reno wned architects and urban planners are now trying to help shape the growth of Asia's cities. They aim to impose some controls on unbridled development and to come up with new architectural solutions for megacities that are unprecedented in size. First and foremost cities in China - such as Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai - and Japan - such as Tokyo and Yokosuka - are developing projects that might serve as models for the entire world. 364859 001The Creative Use of SpaceIn the densely built-up megacities of Asia, living space is scarce and the cost of property astronom-ically high. In the Japanese capital Tokyo, an entire school of architecture is dedicated to the design of compact residential units. For architects, the art lies in the creative use of available space. They build on the tiniest of plots or stack units one on top of the other. They also seek to counter the increasing isolation of urban dwellers by creating communal spaces, modern village communities within the anonymity of the metropolis. Documentary, 30 min., 2015, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR 364859 002 Architecture and LandscapeMost of Asia's new megacities have few public squares or green spaces. The high cost of land and the striving for maximum profit often result in a destructive style of architecture that pays no regard to nature, even though the landscape and greenery have a particular spiritual significance in Asia. But architects have again begun to consider the landscape and to integrate their buildings within it. They are trying to bring nature back into the city, with gardens on roofs and in courtyards and with pools and lakes. Sometimes, the architecture itself becomes the landscape, as in the Fake Hills project in the Chinese city of Beihai.

They were among the most successful painters of the 16th century, working as court painters and immortalizing Martin Luther and the Reformation in their paintings. They also ran printing workshops, were paper wholesalers, had a pharmacy license and were mayors of the renowned university city of Wittenberg. In Cologne, the Cranachs' work is being digitized - a treasure trove for professionals and art lovers. The Cranach Digital Archive (CDA) makes it possible to zoom in on even the tiniest figures or the fine networks of cracks in painted faces. Our film follows in the Cranachs' footsteps and provides an insight into the lives, work and times of the famous family of painters. With its 17,000 islands, 800 languages and 300 ethnic groups, Indonesia is a nation of superlatives. And one that is still searching for a common identity. After 350 years of Dutch colonial rule, decades of regional independence wars and a military regime that cost the lives of a million people, the country has yet to look its past squarely in the eye. For many years, a number of courageous writers have been agitating for this process to begin, by tackling subjects that still remain shrouded in silence: As a student in the 1990s, Linda Christanty from Jakarta joined the movement to topple Suharto. Azhari Aiyub from Banda Aceh writes about the region's past struggle for liberation and coping with the aftermath of the tsunami. Oka Rusmini lives on the island of Bali.

They are places to find shade and to rest, places for families and friends to gather. But the typical features of such gardens were developed much earlier: 2,500 years ago, the kings of Persia commissioned magnificent palace gardens, bursting with fragrant flowers and shrubs, cooled by watercourses, pools and fountains, and surrounded by high walls. Pavilions and trellises provided shade and dappled sunlight. The kings' engineers created underground channels to bring water from faraway sources. Thes e palace gardens stood in stark contrast to the arid and inhospitable landscape that surrounded them. With their symmetry and opulent vegetation, they were seen as ideal images of nature. It is no coincidence that ideas of para-dise in Judaism, Christianity and Islam were informed by such gardens. Whether on a grand scale, as the imposing park of a ruler's palace, or on a more modest scale as the courtyard of a merchant's house - this kind of garden spread, along with Islam, to the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia, North Africa, Spain and the Indian subcontinent. While remaining true to its basic principles, it developed in different ways in each region. The ga rdens in Morocco's oases and coastal towns are often embellished with splendid architectural elements, colorful ceramics and decorative metalwork. In India, under the Muslim Mughal emperors, many impressive parks were laid out, with huge ornamental pools. One famous example is at the Taj Mahal in Agra. In medieval Spain, horticulture flourished during the era of Moorish rule: For centuries, the opulent palace gardens of the Alhambra in Granada were also an inspiration to architects of Christian rulers. And in Arabia, the planners of public parks adhere to ancient tradition to this day: Fountains and streams with rippling water, trees that provide shade, and aromatic herbs are seen as indispensable features in spaces that offer the inhabitants of densely built-up cities relief from the heat and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. 364893 001 Pers ia - The Fount of Paradise 364893 002 Moro cco - Artful Beauty 364893 003 India Har mony and Mag nificence 364893 Anda lusia - The Moorish Garden as Leitmotif 364893 005 Arab ia - Parks and Gardens for the 21st CenturyThe Search for Perfection Islamic Garden Design CULTURECULTURE 384902 Documentary, 03 x 60 min., 2018, HD;Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEWhat do escalators in Medell\u00edn, Arabic lettering in Amman, story-telling furni - ture from London, urban farming in Detroit and a co-living complex in Tokyo have to do with the Bauhaus? The ar chitect Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Weimar in 1919. He brought together some of the most illustrious artists in Europe to create a school that would fuse the fine arts and the crafts. Together, they set out to fundamentally rethink the world and society. Although the Bauhaus school - which later relocated to Dessau and then to Berlin - only existed for a few years, it revolutionized ideas about the organization of modern life. In 201 9, the Bauhaus will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding. To mark the occasion, planetfilm has produced a series of three documentaries for Deutsche Welle. The films focus on the influence that the philosophy of the Bauhaus movement still exerts on the globalized society of the 21st century. They also explore historical parallels between 1919 and the present day: Society is facing major upheavals and challenges, just as it did back then. We mee t architects, urban planners, designers and artists from around the globe who, in the spirit of the Bauhaus, want to rethink and change the world. Tatiana Bilbao, for example, is a Mexican architect who has designed an 8,000-dollar house for the poorest members of society. The designer Ahmed Humeid is working on plans to bring order to the traffic chaos of the Jordanian capital Amman. How and where will the world's burgeoning population live in future? Minimalistically and collectively in tiny spaces, as the German architect Van Bo Le-Mentzel envisages it? Or maybe even on Mars?

All Lit Up: The \"Luminale\" Festival The six-day 'Luminale' festival turns Frankfurt in Germany into a sea of light, with installations by light artists making more than 100 sites in the city sparkle and shine.European architecture stands out through an almost unparalleled pluralism of style. The striking build - ings of the modern era are characterized sometimes by structural achievements or the innovative use of materials, sometimes by a special language of form. In view of such architectural variety, it is impossible to talk in terms of a pan-European style. Yet constants and popular stylistic devices can be identified. In postmodern architecture everything seems possible: from geometric cubes to organic domes, from neo-classical stylistic creations to futuristic constructions. To a ce rtain extent, the latest examples of post- modern European architecture pay homage to the old rule \"form follows function\", which dominated all schools of architecture and design in the early 20th century. We pr oudly present Euromaxx Architecture showcasing the most important and exciting and also the most controversial European buildings of the 20th and 21st centuries.

But design involves more than just shaping and styling: good design is a complex process in which different and often contradictory requirements have to be met to ensure that objects function in the desired way. Design is only good when aesthetic, ergonomic and ecological aspects, durability, function and comfort harmonize and complement one another.

Berlin is one of the most captivating cities in the world, and not just because of its fascinating history. It has long been regarded as a multi-cultural, creative metropolis with lots of green space and a night life unrivalled for its diversity and exuberance. 564842 002 Time Travel - Retracing the Footsteps of Famous GermansWe visit some key locations in the lives of influential Germans.

The series follows a bus that travels from Rio de Janeiro to Lima. The bus trip lasts six days and covers a distance of 6,300 kilometers - a journey of superlatives. A voyage filled with contrast: from the Atlantic, it leads initially through a savannah landscape, then through the Earth's largest area of wetland, the Amazon jungle, and finally up to the Andes and the Pacific on the western side of the mountain range. The road movie affords the viewer a glimpse into the soul of South America. It shows the beauty of its nature and the pride of its people, but also some of the negatives: environmental pollution, poverty and crime. 584888 001 The Maiden Voyage: From the Copacabana to Cowboys 584888 002 Crossing Jungle, Barricades and Borders: From Brazil to Peru 584888 003 The Final Stage: Over the Andes to LimaTransoce\u00e2nica The World's Longest Bus JourneyPLACESAlong the Rhine The Rhine is one of Europe's great rivers, and has long been bound up with myth and mystery. Majestic and romantic, scenic and legendary are just some of the adjectives used to describe it. The French writer Victor Hugo called it a \"noble river\". And the English landscape painter William Turner captured the essence of the romantic Rhine. No ot her river in Germany is so steeped in legend. For example, it is said that the Nibelung treasure lies on the riverbed near the town of Worms. Further north, the beautiful Lorelei would bewitch hapless sailors with her song and cause them to capsize their boats. The rock that bear her name is visited by tourists from all over the world. The R hine not only has its place in myths and legends, songs and poems, it also plays a political and economic role. Whereas it used to serve as a dividing line between \"arch enemies\" Germany and France, today it unites the two neighbors now perceived as the motor driving European unity. The river serves as a key transport route between the industrial cities along its course and the North Sea. Its banks are strewn with romantic towns and villages drawing tourists with their quaint alleys, picturesque half-timbered houses and countless pubs selling local wines and beers. Another attraction are the region's many castles, formerly customs posts that brought their owners great wealth and now elegant restaurants and hotels. 524830 Clips, 03 x 05 min., 2014, SD;English, German, Portuguese, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE 524831 Clips, 14 x 01 min., 2014, SD;English, German, Portuguese, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEPLACES524831 001 Konstanz 002 Basel Duisburg 524831 014 RotterdamTable of Contents CHILDREN ORDER NUMBER FORMAT RUNNING TIME Come and See My World! 764826 Documentary 40 x 30 min.

Striker Franz Roth recalls: \"The ball came so high over me, the goalkeeper came towards me and at the moment when the defender almost brought me down, I tried to lift the ball over the goalie. He couldn't get to it and the ball went in under the bar. That was the goal. Fantastic! I kept the trophy overnight on my bedside table and stared at it. All night long...\" In th e years that followed, Bayern Munich rapidly grew from erstwhile regional club to one of the most successful and best-known global soccer brands. Not least due to some 60 national and international titles and international star players, Bayern Munich's current membership stands at almost 300,000. Then there are about 4,300 fanclubs and millions of fans all over the world. \"What makes this club so special, isn't winning the Champions League, it's not the titles, it's the inclusive team concept with the fans,\" says Raffael, a fan from Puerto Rico. But a t the same time, few clubs manage to polarize opinion in the soccer world like Bayern, a club you either hate or love. Real Madrid once branded it \"La Bestia Negra\", a black beast that cannot be vanquished. Jaime Carrasco, a sports reporter for El Mundo says: \"There are in the world only two or three teams that have maintained such a continuous will to win over the years. Perhaps Barcelona and Madrid - and definitely FC Bayern.\" Phi lipp Lahm spent more than two decades \"asserting myself in the FC Bayern shark pool\", an effort that eventually earned him the captain's shirt. Why can so few players resist the call from Munich? And how was a club with such strong southern German roots able to develop such global appeal? Clu b President Uli Hoeness says FC Bayern is \"for many people some- thing akin to a homeland, a substitute family\". Players, coaches and fans from all over the globe explain the global \"Bayern Munich Phenomenon\". The film provides insights into the Bavarian club, its traditions, the way it sees itself, and its visions for the future.484890 Documentary, 60 min., 2018, HD Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, IFE SPORTSNeed to Compete 464874 001 Cabers, Hammers and Kilts - The Highland Games in ScotlandHighland Games are held every year across Scotland's rugged north.

But a form of the game was played in China some 2,300 years ago in the city of Linzi, the capital of the kingdom of Qi. The winners were awarded prizes, while the losers were flogged. Other versions of what we call football are associated with Egypt, Greece, the Roman Empire, and France. But it was in England in 1863 that the Football Association was founded which drew up the first rules of the game as we know it today. From E ngland the sport spread throughout the world. International matches and Olympic tournaments first made soccer popular in Europe. Then, in the 1920s the game also conquered Latin America. The fi rst World Cup tournament was held in Uruguay in 1930. In the final in Montevideo, the host nation defeated Argentina. The next two tournaments, 1934 and 1938, were won by Italy. In 1938 Indonesia became the first Asian nation to qualify for the World Cup finals. The 1950 tournament in Brazil saw Uruguay emerge as champions for the second time.

The w ork of Ludwig van Beethoven, who was born in Bonn in 1770 and died in Vienna in 1827, brought the Viennese School to its stylistic zenith, and thereby served as a bridge between Classicism and Romanticism.

For decades, researchers have tried to reconstruct the progression of his illnesses and seek clues as to the cause of his death. Ana lysis of strands of his hair by scientists in the US suggests Beethoven died from lead poisoning. That might also explain his deafness, mood swings and angry outbursts. But it is not clear why he should have been exposed to a lot of lead. The re are also questions about the history of the lock of hair that was brought to the US for analysis. One day after Beethoven died, his friend the pianist and composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel visited his apartment to bid him farewell. Beethoven's body was laid out in his coffin. Hummel was accompanied by a young student of his named Ferdinand Hiller, who cut off the lock of hair as a memento. It was kept by the Hiller family and passed on as an heirloom through the generations. The lock came into the possession of a doctor in a small town in Nazi-occupied Denmark. Who gave him the hair? Why? Nobody knows. Half a century later, in 1994, his daughter sold it at Sotheby's in London.

They offer a refreshing take on the work of one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. \"Af ter performing all of Schumann's symphonies you get a sense that what you learned about him at school was simply wrong. Robert Schumann's symphonic music is amazing. If you're brave enough to look beyond tradition and focus solely on the music, you'll see just how impressive it is.\" The project Schumann at Pier2 consists of two elements: a concert film and a recording of Schumann's four symphonies. The c oncert film Schumann at Pier2 offers a new and unconventional encounter with Schumann's symphonic oeuvre. The film stars the US-Estonian conductor Paavo J\u00e4rvi and the German Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra Bremen. The setting is Pier2, a former shipyard in Bremen harbor. Usually a venue for rock and pop concerts, on this occasion it hosts performances of Schumann's symphonies for a young audience. The fi lm observes the orchestra during rehearsals and presents elaborately recorded performances. Paavo J\u00e4rvi explains key sections of the symphonies and talks about Schumann's life. Studio-takes show members of the orchestra playing selected passages from the sympho-nies and talking about what makes them so special. Sch umann at Pier2 combines these various filmic elements - concerts, rehearsals and studio recordings - into an entertaining, informative and fascinating musical experience.MUSIC Gloria in Excelsis Deo - Celebratory Music at Christmas 684878 The little town of Marienberg is situated in the Ore Mountains of eastern Germany.

Live music, 52 min., 2016, HD; LR Robert Stolz: Es bl\u00fcht eine Fortuna Nuestra On the Morning of 25 December Irving Berlin: I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas MUSIC Wintry Dreams and Christmas Melodies 664705 Festive music to celebrate Christmas. On the programme: Arcangelo Corelli's \"Christmas Concerto\" played by the Baden-Baden Philharmonic, as well as traditional songs and other seasonal melodies. Concert venues include the Kurhaus Baden-Baden, castles, museums, churches and abbeys in southwestern Germany. The centrepiece is the famous \"Christmas Concerto\", a work that is easily as well known as Antonio Vivaldi's \"Four Seasons\" these days. It has an especially rich structure, with regard to movement progression, dynamics and melodic structure. Agg ressive sections alternate with wistfully pastoral parts, painfully dissonant movements with calm and peaceful ones; very fast, almost hurried sections are abruptly interspersed with measured passages that almost appear to be grinding to a halt. An intense musical game of questions and answers serves to draw all these divergent, contrasting elements together, and despite the ornamentation and virtuoso coloratura passages, the exceptionally soulful dominant violin melody comes very close to part writing for the human voice. The closing 5th movement leads into the famous Pastorale: in a major key, instead of an austere minor key, and in a tranquil, restrained manner, this comforting pastoral music ambles by: in a rocking gait, with cantilenas in thirds and sixths and a pianissimo as subtle as the beat of angels' wings - as the piece draws to a close.
