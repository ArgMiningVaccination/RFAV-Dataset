The nation's local, state, and federal public health agencies have a critical and central role to maximize system-wide pro-health accomplishments. The nation's public health system, as demonstrated by the 2009-10 H1N1 pan - demic response, documented the capacity of public health organizations to operate as a system [13]. On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a worldwide pandemic, indicating that H1N1 spread through community-level transmission world - wide [1, 3,7,14-16]. This system linked the community health and human services agencies at the local, state, national, and international level to effectively address a pandemic that had the potential to cause mass global casualties. This H1N1 influenza public health systems capacity assessment addresses a broad array of emergency re - sponse operational issues, best practices, and challeng -Abstract Objective: In early 2009, H1N1 influenza was identified within the human population [1-5]. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials responded with fo-cused assessment, policy development, and assurances [6-8]. The response was mobilized through efforts including procurement of adequate supply of vaccine, local area span of control, materials acquisition, and facilities and resource identification [ 8]. Methods: Qualitative evaluation of the assurance functions specific to the system's ability to assure safe and healthy conditions are reported [9]. The methodology mirrors Home-land Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) used to assess system capability [ 10]. Results: Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of com-munity responsive disease prevention efforts in partnership with the public health systems mission to unify traditional public sector systems, for-profit systems, and local area systems was accomplished. As a result of this response pharmaceutical industry, health care providers, health care agencies, police/safety, colleges, and health and human service agencies were united [ 11]. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of community response strategies utilizing feedback from sys-tem stakeholders. After-action review processes are a crit-ical part of all-hazards preparedness. This analysis of local health district response to the H1N1 influenza outbreak in-forms future public health service delivery.Results provide a synthesis of local health department's emergency response strategies, challenges encountered, and future-focused emergency response strategy implementation.Keywords H1N1, Influenza, Outbreak, Prevention, Mass vaccination, Volunteer management, Community mitigation, Interoperable communications, Risk communications, Epidemiological sur-veillanceORIGINAL RESEARCHISSN: Prev 2017, 3:050 Page 2 of 7 es faced in providing essential public health services during a pandemic outbreak [13]. Six capabilities were addressed including 1) Mass Vaccination, 2) Volunteer Management, 3) Community Mitigation, 4) Interoper - able Communications, 5) Risk Communications, and 6) Epidemiologic Surveillance and Investigation. Sixty-one of the 130 local public health departments in the State of Ohio voluntarily participated in the evaluation. Data was collected between the months of August, 2009 through March 2010. Findings provided in this report in - clude qualitative data analysis that is intended to give an in-depth understanding of how system responses devel-oped and were managed over the 2009-10 H1N1 mass vaccination response. The qualitative analysis is intend - ed to provide an understanding as to why certain poli - cies, procedures, and best practices emerged at the lo - cal level. Potential limitations of the qualitative analysis include generalizability to all Local Health Departments (LHDs) in the state due to potential response bias. The participating jurisdictions cover approximately 70% of Ohio's population, as the majority of non-participating LHDs represented city or rural county jurisdictions. This analysis represents feedback from both capabil - ity and activities that were experienced throughout the H1N1 influenza pandemic in a combination of health department types [17]. As local public health depart-ments move toward voluntary accreditation and other performance-based evaluation systems, it is critical that systems for data collection be developed and institut - ed to maximize efficiency [18]. To achieve public health objectives of maximal population-level effectiveness, data-driven decision making through centrally coordi - nated dynamic processes are essential. Future all haz-ards emergency response preparation requires time to pause and reflect on 21st-century events [19]. Examples include the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks [20], Hurricane Katrina in 2005 [21], the H1N1 influenza out - break of 2009-10 [22], and the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15 [23]. The primary mission of the public health system uniquely positions the workforce and organizations to transcend barriers in meaningful and impactful ways. The past decade has demonstrated that public health can and does affect community-level health and pop - ulation-level health [24, 25]. A critical challenge to be addressed over the next decade will be to retool the system to work both efficiently and effectively toward the primary objective of maximizing community health and prevention of disease. Activity-level analysis Activities are groups of similar tasks that, when car - ried out according to plans and procedures, allow an entity to demonstrate an associated capability. Such analysis helps assess the effectiveness of individuals working together in the discipline or at the organiza - tional level, and how well team members communicate across organizational boundaries during an incident. Ac -tivity-level analysis formed the basis for this response evaluation. Activities were selected for evaluation from multiple sources including; the Target Capabilities List and the Ohio Department of Health Public Health Emer - gency Response Grant [ 26] guidance documents. Task-level analysis Tasks are specific, discrete actions that individuals or groups must successfully perform or address during re - sponse. Task-level analysis assists representatives of re - sponding entities in analyzing shortcomings or strengths related to these individual actions. This analysis can also help entities target plans, equipment, and training re - sources to improve specific task performance. While this research does not specifically address task level analysis, it does provide information that may identify task-level improvement opportunities. Capability-level analysis Capabilities are combinations of elements (e.g., per- sonnel, planning, organization and leadership, equip - ment and systems, training, exercises, assessments, and corrective actions) that provide the means to achieve a measurable outcome. The capability-level analysis is designed to assist managers and executives in develop- ing operating plans and budgets, communicating with political officials, setting long-range training and plan - ning goals, and developing interagency and inter-juris - dictional agreements. For the purpose of evaluating this response, six capabilities were selected based upon the broad categories of public health response activities conducted. Methods A qualitative analysis was conducted based upon sur- veys received from 61 participating local public health jurisdictions. The six emergency response capabilities are reported by best practice-related response items as well as identified challenges. For each capability, ad-ditional analyses were conducted on specific response activities to provide additional depth and context. Two independent reviewers trained in qualitative data analysis analyzed the data generated by all partic- ipating LHDs. Both reviewers classified and coded the data and developed theme analyses as a result of the data reported by the respondents. Within each of the six domains, key questions have been selected and are reported. Researchers developed the original survey data col - lection instrument. Questions were developed across the six target capability areas as well as for clinical oper-ations and vaccination shipment data. Survey questions consisted of dichotomized (yes/no) questions, quantita - tive numeric data, and short answer/best practices re - sponse narrative type. The full survey instrument can be provided upon request.ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 10.23937/2469-5793/1510050 Mase et al. J Fam Med Dis Prev 2017, 3:050 Page 3 of 7 Sample population and selection All LHDs within the State of Ohio were invited to par- ticipate. The Association of Ohio Health Commissioners served as the lead agency on the initiative with the as- sistance of researchers from the Ohio State University Center for Public Health Practice and an external faculty consultant. The response rate, as calculated as the total number of participating local public health jurisdictions divided by the total number of jurisdictions statewide, is calculated at 47%. While just under half of the state's lo - cal health districts participated, these jurisdictions cov-er approximately 70% of Ohio's population. Responses were received from most of the major metropolitan ar-eas including Akron, Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Co - lumbus, Toledo, and Youngstown as well as geographi- cally dispersed suburban and rural districts. Data collection protocols Data collection occurred in two phases. During the first phase, representatives from participating jurisdic - tions entered their data into a commercial online survey system. A separate survey was deployed for each of the six assessed capabilities. Additionally, respondents used the online survey system to enter data about each mass vaccination clinic and all vaccine shipments during the reporting period, which was August 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009. Additional data was collected from January 1, 2010, through March 31, 2010. These data were also entered directly by the participating jurisdic - tions. The Association of Health Commissioners (AOHC) provided all communications to the participating juris - dictions regarding data collection and assisted in data entry for some participants. There was also a strong mo- tivation for accuracy as participating jurisdictions used the information they entered to hold subsequent local after-action review meetings with their response part- ners. Mass vaccination tracking systems varied widely by LHD. Common tracking methods included the Ohio De- partment of Health IMPACT SIIS system. The IMPACT SIIS is the statewide immunization information system [27] which uses hand-written logs and Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheet data entry. Given the variability within LHD delivery systems and staffing models, a variety of methods for tracking vaccine and vaccination supplies emerged. Many LHDs reported that limiting ordering, distribution, and accounting to one representative per jurisdiction was an effective approach in promoting ac- curacy and maximizing efficiency. Local public health districts were afforded the oppor - tunity to address the H1N1 epidemic using an approach that was most appropriate for their unique set of cir- cumstances. Public health districts were tasked with the primary objective of mass vaccination to specific popu - lations. Local area leadership had the flexibility and au-tonomy to develop, operate, and implement emergen - cy response plans for vaccinating the entire public. Results Findings are reported for each of the six emergency response capacities; 1) mass vaccination, 2) volunteer management, 3) community mitigation, 4) interopera-ble communication, 5) risk communication and 6) ep-idemiologic surveillance and investigation. Results are intended to provide details as to effective strategies im-plemented as well as to offer post-event review to guide future systems improvements. Capability 1: Mass vaccination The best practices for utilizing Incident Command System (ICS) for mass vaccination activities include col - or-coded vests, communication before and after, clear staff role delineation, and maintaining same staff in same roles across time. ICS was consistently reported as an effective approach across all LHDs. Some effective tools were used by LHDs including job action sheets, feedback protocols, briefing/debriefing, written proto - cols, structural details, and common language. LHD's re - ported using locations such as schools, health districts, and community centers to create mass vaccination clin - ics. Challenges with ICS include operational implemen - tation, staff matching for operational role(s), staff edu-cation about common language, and lack of sufficient staff to provide mass vaccination operations. Challenges for identifying and enrolling H1N1 vaccine providers in - cluded: lack of user-friendliness with complex data en-try systems, lack of participation among providers, and minimum dose requirements for participation. The most commonly cited challenge was the com- plexity and associated issues relating to the IMPACT SIIS data entry system. Respondents consistently reported that the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) on-line sys-tem for providers was complex, not user-friendly, the ODH order system was confusing, and some provider computer systems were outdated. Many health districts reported that local healthcare providers opted not to participate because training was time-consuming, tak-ing them away from their regular clinical practice com-mitment. Many providers did not like governmental in - trusion into their practice. Additionally, local providers stated that there were no incentives for participation and, in fact, there were disincentives. Some providers lacked adequate refrigeration units to secure and main - tain vaccine at appropriate temperatures. The ODH Fri - day briefings were beneficial as they opened communi - cation lines between all parties. Capability 2: Volunteer management Improved communications including advance brief- ings and debriefings were suggested as an effective strategy to promote high-quality mass vaccination clin - ics. Many LHD representatives reported that the par-ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 10.23937/2469-5793/1510050 J Fam 2017, 3:050 Page 4 of 7 ative agreements were beneficial as well as frequent departmental briefings. Targeted efforts to reach out to Spanish speaking populations through targeted media messaging in many communities were achieved. Many respondents mentioned an initial fear and panic in their jurisdiction that challenged their infra - structure. Some reported that incorrect information was disseminated through the media that decreased the effectiveness of the LHD's campaign to educate the public on the virus. After disease incidence waned, and rumors of the virus being less severe than originally ex-pected spread, the general public grew apathetic and disinterested in receiving the vaccine despite repeated recommendations from the LHDs. Some school districts acted against or without LHD authorized recommenda - tion. In particular, social distancing was found difficult to implement, especially when businesses, schools, and parents began to perceive the virus as less of a threat. Many LHDs provided schools with CDC H1N1 toolkits and guidance documents to best assist at the local level. Many LHD representatives also commented that their communication with the ODH was strained and less than productive. Many respondents cited that ODH had inconsistent messages and information, and this was a source of frustration and confusion. Vaccine ordering and delivery, lack of staff, and difficulties in communi - cating with the CDC were also of concern. Capability 4: Interoperable communication Most LHDs mentioned the use of traditional modes of communication in their responses. Blast faxing, mass e-mails and phone calls were seen as efficient strate - gies to communicate with healthcare providers. Several respondents added that the voice over Internet pro-tocols kept involved parties informed throughout this \"highly fluid\", potentially moment-to-moment chang-ing situation. Multi-Agency Radio Communication Sys-tem (MARCS) radios were a frequently discussed topic in LHD's responses. Some found that staff training in MARCS radio operation was beneficial. Some respon-dents also discovered that MARCS radios were ideal for communications between the physician practices/clin - ics and departmental operations centers. While staff training in MARCS radios was a topic of concern, most LHD representatives described the im- provement of MARCS radio abilities as a best practice worth pursuing. Improvements to the MARCS system include the use of a portable 800 MHz tower, removal of the interference with other emergency communication systems, and increased collaboration with emergency medical assistance (EMA). Many representatives found that their MARCS radios did not function in the build - ings in which they were operating. Some LHDs lacked enough MARCS radios for their operations. Some lacked the ability to set up phone banks to receive the multi - tude of calls they were getting. Several representatives lamented about the lack of regional and state cooper-ticipation of students from health professions schools/colleges, particularly nursing programs, was an effec - tive partnership extending the number of appropriately skilled personnel. It was recommended that an up-to-date volunteer database be maintained including mul - tiple health-related professionals such as nurses, family medicine practitioners, EMT's, social workers, mental health professionals, and other such professionals. The recommendation to maintain appropriate credential-ing and licensure in this database was advised. Google scheduling was suggested as an effective tool for vol-unteer scheduling and coordination. Many LHDs hosted hospitality efforts such as feeding volunteers and recog - nition for their efforts. Written policies and procedures for volunteers were vital to successful operations. There was need for formal written and operational policies and training for volunteers. Additionally, there was a need to develop processes and protocols for man-aging volunteer staff in practice within the mass vacci-nation clinical setting. The medical reserve corps (MRC) was an asset, but expansion for the MRC across multiple health-related disciplines was necessary. The utility of an expanded MRC would resolve a concern of many health district representatives relating to the issue that there were unresolved legal issues, liability issues, and health professionals credentialing concerns. In the future, there needs to be a larger and expanded pool of volun - teers. There were issues reported as to dependability and reliability of volunteers. Problems were created by time conflicts relating to mass vaccination clinic sched-uling that conflicted with regular work scheduled for volunteers who have practices and regularly scheduled work at the same time as the clinics. A consistent theme was reported that volunteers are needed to report in a 'just-in-time' model prior to a mass vaccination clinic to receive instruction and training. Communication with volunteers presented a challenge for volunteers with no e-mail access. A system for communication in the future that overcomes this challenge will be vital to success. Of specific concern for LHDs was an early rush and re - sponse on the part of community-based volunteers that decreased substantially as time passed. This is of partic- ular concern for future public health emergencies that might occur for an extended period. Capability 3: Community mitigation Public information management was critical. Fore- most, it is essential that public information officers provide clear and consistent messages to the media. Among the media messages that were reported by LHD representatives were: 1) hand-washing and hygiene, 2) \"Cover your cough\", and 3) social distancing. Public health worked effectively with local school superinten - dents statewide to monitor absenteeism rates and to modify attendance policies. Public information manage - ment was vital, and it was important to have correct and consistent media messaging. Local school cooper-ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 10.23937/2469-5793/1510050 Mase et al. J Fam Med Dis Prev 2017, 3:050 Page 5 of 7 maintaining long standing lines of communication with these community partners ensured both accuracy and cooperation in surveillance. The school symptom sur-veillance system was another key best practice accord-ing to many respondents. One specific improvement to this was modeled after a best practice in Tarrant County, Texas [28,29]. Many respondents also cited the continued creation of weekly reports when considering best practices. These reports organized epidemiological data and trends so that the LHDs could best assist phy-sicians in addressing issues surrounding the virus and immunization of their patient populations. Some LHD representatives advocated utilizing their standard sur-veillance practices, explaining that these can be applied to any abnormal situation. These LHDs felt that by using systems already in place they decreased the \"unneces - sary\" work created by building a new surveillance sys-tem, thereby decreasing response time. An area of major concern for LHDs involved the changes in the ODH testing algorithm. Many respon- dents reported that the \"inconsistency\" of recommen - dations from ODH and CDC was a source of confusion for physicians and LHDs alike. Numerous LHDs described themselves as overwhelmed at times. The sharing of one epidemiologist between multiple health districts and small staffs were frequently viewed as problematic. Many of respondents also noted difficulties with coop - eration of surveillance partners. Several LHDs cited phy-sicians' inconsistent reporting or confusion with the al-gorithms as obstacles to successful surveillance, which was one of the factors that adversely impacted the qual - ity and timeliness of data collection. Rural respondents reported that the lack of health care providers in their areas was a contributing factor affecting timeliness and accuracy. Emergency department visits and influenza-like in - fection hospital visits were both prevalent syndrome-re - lated surveillance indicators, with EpiCenter cited as an important tool for detecting anomalies in that data. In some cases, LHDs reported that they followed this data for surrounding regional hospitals as well, especially when there were no hospitals in their jurisdiction. Epi - Center was also used in some LHDs to track respiratory and constitutional syndromes, cough, and fever symp-toms at those hospitals. Many respondents mentioned attendance tracking systems at local school systems in describing their surveillance indicators. Over-the-counter sales of thermometers and related medications were indicators that many LHDs reportedly used. LHDs tracked this information using the Nation Retail Data Monitor (NRDM) system. LHDs used Ohio Disease Re-porting System (ODRS) to track influenza hospitaliza - tions. Also, some respondents mentioned tracking the number of rapid influenza tests completed and con - firmed as well as influenza-related deaths through the coroner's office. Additionally, web search tracking was cited among several LHDs.ation and large amounts of information from the CDC and the ODH, which could barely be processed by the limited staff. Another cause of concern for the LHDs was problems in receiving timely and accurate information from their vertical partners. Many health district rep-resentatives stated that frequent changes in guidance from partners such as the CDC and ODH overwhelmed them and decreased their credibility with other part-ners. LHDs must have streamlined approaches that in - crease efficient leadership and minimize ambiguity and confusion. Capability 5: Risk communication One of the challenges concerning risk communica - tion and disease prevention massaging experienced by LHDs was that information received at the local level from the ODH as well as from the CDC conflicted with earlier communications to the public. Indeed, as the H1N1 response activities unfolded from early 2009 through 2010, the local response was necessarily dy-namic as the unfolding of the pandemic and subsequent risk communication strategies emerged. Often, the gen-eral public was confused by these changing and at times conflicting messages. LHDs with public information offi-cers (PIOs) report that centrally coordinated communi - ty-level disease prevention communications through a central point person were effective and reduced confu - sion and public unrest. Many of the LHDs expressed concern that local me - dia aggravated public fear and confusion. Concerns over media were mixed. As some representatives reported that their existing and open communication with the lo - cal media was effective and was defined as a best prac-tice, other LHDs lacking existing communications with local media suffered from strained relations. LHDs with PIOs often implemented a strategy of regular communi - cation with local media with timely and regular commu-nication. Multiple communication avenues proved to be most effective including telephone, press conferences, web-based and other routes of information dissemina - tion. The recall of vaccine also presented problems for LHDs, and some reported community members failing to trust the effectiveness of the vaccine. Finding ways to communicate risk to minority groups, especially those for whom English is a second language, was also cited as a challenge. Finally, the media's frequent distortion of information was a continuous challenge faced by many LHDs. Capability 6: Epidemiologic surveillance and inves- tigation Many LHD representatives referred to effective com- munication and solid relationships with local partners including hospital infection control staff, family medi-cine practitioners, and other community physicians as an important practice. Overseeing a coordinated effort such as epidemiological surveillance, LHDs believed that ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 2017, 3:050 Page 6 of 7 fective communication plan requires transparency, full participation, centralization, and coordination. Above all, the effective coordination of disease prevention during a public health emergency is essential. An ef-fective response takes advanced planning and effective coordination requiring a great amount of time and dil - igence. Conclusions This post-event analysis of qualitative data generat - ed across the 6-month H1N1 influenza outbreak rein-forces many of the best practices as defined by the ICS. The six emergency response capacities are an effective structural model by which to evaluate system effective - ness and response. The vast majority of the post event analysis points to effective and efficient public health systems response. Areas for systems improvement relate specifically to improved mobilization of emergency response sys-tems and enhanced communication updates about outbreaks. Also recommended, was the importance of PIOs serving as intermediaries between the press and the public. Effective internal organizational communications re - lating to the chain of command, specifically effective up and down the chain of command communications were recommended. Effective communication between fed-eral, state, and local public health authorities play a crit-ical role in epidemiological surveillance and outbreak risk reduction. Based on these findings it is fair to state that the State of Ohio public health system response to the H1N1 outbreak was effective. The response demonstrated ef- fective system wide success across all six emergency response capacities. If one key lesson is to be learned from this assessment, it would be that after-action re - view processes are of vital importance, playing a critical part in the all-hazards preparedness operations ulti - mately reducing the spread of disease. This after-action review provides evidence as to the utility of vaccination planning and delivery at the popu - lation level [31]. Resources are provided by the WHO as to effective planning, implementing, evaluating, and re - tooling of mass vaccination initiatives. As demonstrated by this and other pandemics, the key to effective popu - lation-level response is maximized by systems thinking and systems-level quality improvement utilizing best practices evidence. Acknowledgement Thank you to the Association of Ohio Health Com- missioners, the 61 participating health departments, and the Ohio State University Center for Public Health Practice for their leadership in developing this post dis - ease outbreak evaluation.Discussion Consistency of information was a significant issue throughout the six-month evaluation period data was reported. Of critical importance was that public health emergencies are fluid, constantly changing with the passage of time. As new information and best practices toward response emerge, disease prevention officials are charged with implementing real-time responses to maximize public health protections. Communications are central to effective response plans. These communi - cations are multi-directional including within workforce, up and down the chain of command, across affiliated or-ganizational partners, between media, and to the gen-eral public. Of particular importance is that local area leadership be afforded the flexibility in establishing and implementing methods that best serve the entire citi- zenry. Training and education Advanced preparation as well as just in time train- ing are essential for future public health emergency re - sponse operations. Maintaining core clinical medicine skill sets within the workforce as well as the voluntary medical reserve corps is vital. Local leadership must continue to be vigilant about maintaining fundamen - tal-basic, clinical skill sets and assure the workforce is appropriately trained. Given the immediacy and com-plexity of the H1N1 immunization response, the ability to reach out to voluntary workers within the community was instrumental. The clear and consistent message re - ceived in their public health practice response was that the volunteer base was less than sufficient to meet com-munity-level needs during a large-scale response [30]. Databases and systems to coordinate voluntary workers need to be improved in an intentional and on-going sys-tematic manner. Education differs from training. Training can be un - derstood as hands on, skill-set oriented, and process outcomes oriented. Education is more overarching, en-compassing understanding and awareness among indi - viduals. As demonstrated in this evaluation, there are different levels of educational needs and educational resources. Messages are dynamic; changing with the passage of time. Although both training and education are active, it is important to recognize that training is skills-based and should be assured in an on-going sys-tematic manner. Education is multi-directional and needs to be implemented effective and responsive. Coordination Coordination of activities in a changing, complex, and dynamic environment is critical. Articulation and awareness of the ICS protocols are necessary but not sufficient, full and effective communications are re - quired throughout the multiple-evolved communities and are necessary to inform, engage, and evolve the community-wide system stakeholders [30]. The evalua-tion themes include fear and varied information among the media, schools, and a host of other sources. An ef-ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 10.23937/2469-5793/1510050 Mase et al.
