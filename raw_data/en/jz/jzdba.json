We strive to empower students to become more responsible and proactive in their own physical, emotional, and social health. Our medical practitioners provide initial consultation, evaluation, treatment, and follow up for illnesses and injuries. All services and supplies provided at Health Services are free of charge to any student, whether they are full time or part time, resident or non-resident. There are times when the provider may determine that a student's specific injury or illness should be treated by a specialist, may require additional procedures (x-ray, lab work, etc.) or treatment at a more advanced facility. When that occurs, it is recommended that the student collaborate with their health insurance provider to determine what additional costs may be incurred by the referral as any off-campus service and all prescription medications are the student's financial responsibility. The following diagnostic tests are available at no charge to the student, upon the order of our provider: RAPID STREP TEST | MONO TEST | ROUTINE URINALYSIS | PREGNANCY TEST | TB TESTS In compliance with Virginia state law, Bridgewater College requires entering students to provide immunization documentation of the vaccines listed, in order to continue to be registered and participate in classes: - Current TDAP - within 10 years - Hepatitis B - 3 dose series - Meningitis (MenACWY or MenB) (at age 16-23) - Varicella At institutions of higher education, the confidentiality of medical records is governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Information contained in the medical and mental health record of each student is confidential and may not be released to anyone outside of the College, including parents, without written permission from the student, except under specific emergency circumstances as outlined by the Code of Virginia. If a student has any chronic condition, takes special medication, or needs specific health treatment, it is recommended that they make these needs known to the appropriate department. If the student lives with a condition (i.e. insulin dependent diabetes or a history of seizures, etc.) that may require emergency assistance at some point, it may also be helpful to notify Residence Life Professional Staff. We encourage all students to maintain comprehensive, primary health insurance coverage while enrolled at Bridgewater. Students are responsible for all medical expenses, except for those provided by the Student Health Center. The College does not provide student health insurance.

Sexual health is \"a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled\" (WHO, 2006a). Why is sexual health important? Sexual health has a direct effect on and is directly affected by other areas of health, including but not limited to physical, emotional, social, and mental health. It is important to stay well-informed on ways to practice safe sexual health so that you are respectful to yourself and other individuals. Good ways to practice good sexual health (include drop down info below each of these bullet points): - Consent - What is Consent? - Consent is informed, freely and actively given, and mutually understandable words or actions that indicate a willingness to participate in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity. We can remember what consent is by using the acronym F.R.I.E.S. (Freely Given, Reversible, Informed, Enthusiastic, and Specific) - Protection - It is extremely important that if you choose to be sexually active, that you and your partner(s) use measure to protect yourselves against STDs and unplanned pregnancies. These can include (but are not limited to): - Condoms - 85% effective as the only form of birth control. Condoms are a physical barrier used during intercourse that prevents pregnancy by stopping sperm from getting into the vagina. Latex and non-latex condoms can also protect against STDs when used properly during oral, anal, or vaginal sex. While most condoms are made to cover the penis during intercourse there are also internal condoms that are inserted into the vagina prior to intercourse. Internal condoms have a lower effectiveness as a form of birth control at 79% effective. - Birth Control Pills - 91% effective as a form of birth control. Birth control pills are used by individuals assigned female at birth and contain hormones that stops ovulation and thicken the mucus on the cervix to prevent fertilization of an egg by a sperm. Birth control pills come in a pack and are taken once a day at the exact same time. It does not protect against STDs. - Patch - 91% effective as a form of birth control. Similar to the birth control pill the patch is a hormonal birth control. The patch is used by individuals assigned female at birth. The patch is placed on the skin in specific areas, typically the stomach or back, and releases hormones to stop ovulation and thicken the mucus on the cervix to prevent fertilization of an egg by a sperm. The patch must be replaced weekly. It does not protect against STDs. - Shot - 94% effective as a form of birth control. The birth control shot is given by a healthcare provider once every three months. The shot is used by individuals assigned female at birth. The shot is a form of hormonal birth control that releases hormones to stop ovulation and thicken the mucus on the cervix to prevent fertilization of an egg by a sperm. It does not protect against STDs. - Implant - 99% effective as a form of birth control. The birth control implant or Nexplanon is a small, thin rod that is inserted into the upper arm. The birth control implant is used by individuals assigned female at birth. The implant is a form of hormonal birth control that releases hormones to stop ovulation and thicken the mucus on the cervix to prevent fertilization of an egg by a sperm. The implant can last up to five years. It does not protect against STDs. - Diaphragm - 88% effective as a form of birth control. A diaphragm is a form of birth control that's a shallow cup shaped like a little saucer that's made of soft silicone. It is bent in half and inserted it inside the vagina to cover the cervix. A diaphragm is a non-hormonal birth control. For a diaphragm to be most effective it must be used with a spermicide (a cream or gel that kills sperm). The diaphragm must be inserted for every session of intercourse. It does not protect against STDs. - Intrauterine Device (IUD) - 99% effective as a form of birth control. The IUD is a small flexible plastic device shaped like a \"T\". The IUD is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. There are two types of IUDs copper and hormonal. Copper IUDs have no hormones but contain copper and can prevent pregnancy for up to 12 years. Hormonal IUDs releases hormones to stop ovulation and thicken the mucus on the cervix to prevent fertilization of an egg by a sperm. Hormonal IUDs can last for 3-7 years. IUDs do not protect against STDs. - Things to consider: - These are only a few of many forms of birth control. It is important to talk to your doctor if you plan on using forms of birth control. They will help you make the most informed choice about which form of birth control is best for you. - Forms of protection will depend on you and your partner(s) level of comfort and health factors, such as allergies. - Communication - It is important to talk about sex with your doctor and have honest conversations and questions. - Being clear and direct with your sexual partner(s) is very important. You should talk about your boundaries and expectations. - If you were diagnosed with an STD, you should disclose this to your sexual partner(s) since they may be affected too. - Education - It is important to know about sex, including risk factors, consent, communication, how to practice sex safely, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and abuse. - To learn more about sexual health and wellness visit: [cdc.gov/sexualhealth/](http://www.cdc.gov/sexualhealth/) - Sexual Misconduct - Sexual assault is any form of unwanted sexual contact obtained without consent or through the use or threat of force, intimidation or coercion.
