Dietary supplements containing vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other substances are popular immune system boosters. Many people use immune boosters to protect against illness and support the body's healing process when fighting an infection. This article explores the potential benefits of the most popular immune system boosters, including vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, echinacea, elderberry, and probiotics. It also covers the best ways to build your immune system to support your overall health. PeopleImages / Getty Images What Kinds of Immune System Boosters Are Out There? There are several immune boosters, and each offers benefits for strengthening your body's natural defense mechanisms. These boosters encompass a range of approaches, including vaccines, nutritious foods, supplements, and lifestyle habits. Immune boosters can support your immune system and reduce the risk of illnesses. Here is an overview of the different types of immune system boosters and their potential benefits. Vaccines Vaccines train your body's immune system to recognize and defend against specific diseases. Many vaccines contain small, harmless pieces of disease-causing germ or a weakened form of the germ itself. When you get a vaccine, your immune system learns how to recognize and fight that particular germ, so if you are exposed to that germ in the future, you do not get sick or have protection from complications of the disease. Vaccines help protect against many different diseases, including: COVID-19 Influenza (flu) Pneumococcal (pneumonia) Measles Mumps Varicella (chicken pox) Food The best way to consume natural immune boosters is through a nutrient-dense diet. Certain foods have immune-boosting properties due to their rich content of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other beneficial compounds. Incorporating these immune-boosting foods into your diet can provide your body with the nutrients it needs to enhance immune function and strengthen your defense against illnesses: Citrus fruits: Regularly consuming foods rich in vitamin C, like oranges, lemons, and grapefruits, can help reduce the duration of upper respiratory infections such as the common cold. Leafy greens: Vegetables like broccoli, kale, and spinach, provide vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to help your body fight many infections, including COVID-19, pneumonia, bronchitis, and influenza (flu). Berries: Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries are packed with antioxidants that can strengthen the immune system. Garlic: Known for its immune-boosting properties, garlic has antimicrobial and antiviral effects, helping protect against and fight bacterial and viral infections. Yogurt: Probiotic-rich yogurt helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which may enhance your body's innate immunity. Supplements Dietary supplements and herbal extracts provide concentrated doses of specific vitamins and minerals that may help support immune function, though they are not necessary if you're eating a balanced diet. Some popular supplements for immune support include: Vitamin C: Widely used as an immune booster, vitamin C supplements can support immune cell function and may reduce the severity and duration of illnesses. Vitamin D: Supplementing with vitamin D can help optimize immune function, especially if you have a vitamin D deficiency. Zinc: Zinc supplements are known to have antiviral effects, improve vaccination responses, and reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract infections. Elderberry extract: Often used to relieve cold and flu symptoms, research shows that elderberry supplements may help reduce the duration of the flu and the common cold and may prevent complications. Echinacea: Echinacea supplements may stimulate immune function and help fight off infections. What to Look for When Shopping for Immune Boosting Supplements When shopping for immune-boosting supplements, exercise caution if you see products that claim to be \"immune-boosting\" without scientific evidence to support the statement. While legitimate immune-supporting supplements are available, the market is flooded with misleading or unsubstantiated claims. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:Choose supplements from well-established brands known for their quality standards.Read the label carefully, checking for specific ingredients that support immune health (e.g., vitamin C, zinc).Look for supplements that have undergone third-party testing or have quality assurance seals from ConsumerLab.com, NSF, or U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP).Talk to a healthcare provider to determine whether you will benefit from taking \"immune boosting\" supplements. Beverages Certain beverages, such as green tea, herbal tea, and fresh juices, are a refreshing and flavorful way to support immune health. The following beverages can help keep you hydrated while providing nutrients to help fortify your immune defense: Green tea: Rich in antioxidants, green tea can provide immune-boosting benefits. Herbal teas: Certain herbal teas, like chamomile tea, contain beneficial compounds with immune-supportive properties. Fresh juices or smoothies: Juices and smoothies made from fresh fruits and vegetables, such as oranges, carrots, and kale, have a high concentration of nutrients easily absorbed by the body to keep your immune system strong. Ginger/turmeric infused water: Ginger has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, and contains curcumin\u2014a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound with immune-modulating effects. Slice fresh ginger and turmeric root, add them to water, and let it infuse for an hour or longer to enjoy the immune-boosting effects and flavor. When to Take Immune System Boosters Foods that contain immune-boosting nutrients like vitamin C and probiotics can help strengthen your immune system but cannot guarantee complete protection from getting sick. There are certain times when you may benefit from taking immune system boosters, such as: After spending time with a sick personWhen you're experiencing signs of low immunityWhen you feel the initial symptoms of sickness (e.g., runny nose, sore throat, fatigue)When you're sick and want to help your body heal When you're sick, immune boosters may help relieve symptoms and support your body's healing process. Vitamin C and zinc, for example, may help reduce the duration and severity of common cold symptoms and are known for their relatively quick impact. If you have signs of low immunity or are immunocompromised due to an underlying medical condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, cancer), immune boosters may help enhance your immune function and strengthen your body's ability to fight infections. Signs of a Weak Immune System Certain signs can indicate your immune system is weak and could use a boost, including:Frequent infections (e.g., respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, skin infections) Delayed or prolonged recovery from infections or illnesses Chronic fatigue, even with adequate sleep and nutrition Frequent digestive troubles (e.g., diarrhea, gas, constipation) High or chronic stress Wounds (e.g., cuts, scrapes) take longer to heal than usual Lifestyle Immune System Booster Healthy lifestyle choices are the best way to build and strengthen your immune system. To optimize your immune function, aim to: Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can enhance immune function and support your overall health. Get enough sleep: Sleep allows your body to rest, repair, and recharge. Lack of sleep increases the risk of infection, and long-term sleep problems increase the risk of chronic disease. Maintain a healthy weight: Excess body weight or obesity can contribute to chronic inflammation, impair immune function, and may reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. Manage stress effectively: Chronic stress can suppress immune function and make you more vulnerable to infections and illness. Stress-reducing activities (e.g., breathwork, meditation) can help lower stress levels. Eat a nutrient-dense diet: Consuming a variety of whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats, can help strengthen your immune system, reduce inflammation, and provide the building blocks for a robust defense against infections. Quit smoking and limit alcohol: Alcohol and smoking can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of infection and chronic diseases. Summary Vitamin C, zinc, echinacea, vitamin D, and elderberry extract are popular supplements that may shorten the duration of certain illnesses, such as the common cold or the flu. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and guidance around supplements based on your needs. Although immune boosters can be helpful, keeping your immune system strong is a continuous process, not an instant fix. Healthy lifestyle habits\u2014including a nutrient-dense diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and healthy body weight\u2014are ideal for maintaining a robust immune system. 18 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
