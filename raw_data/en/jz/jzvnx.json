Here's how (and where) to find wallcoverings that are free of VOCs, healthy, and beautiful for your home!", "sitename": "Well x Design", "date": "2023-04-21", "cleaned_text": "Wallpaper has definitely gone through phases over the years. From the vivid papers in Victorian homes to today's sleek and simple designs, it can be a beautiful way to dress up your house and add personality to your space. But not all wallpaper is safe. There are nontoxic wallpaper options on the market, but it's important to be aware that many wallpapers (and pastes) contain chemicals that could be harmful. Here's what you need to know to choose beautiful nontoxic wallpaper. Photographer: [Caroline Sharpnack](https://www.carolinesharpnack.com) Wall D\u00e9cor and Home Health [In the Renaissance period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper), many upper-class European homes were decorated with tapestries. Wallcovering options were limited, and people would select thick fabric because it provided insulation as well as beauty to their living space. People who couldn't afford tapestries took to covering their walls with paper. Printmakers created designs and patterns for the wallpaper, and by the 1800s, wallpaper was extremely popular in England and France, where many of the panoramic designs were considered works of art. Wallpaper made its way to the United States in the early 19th century and was ubiquitous throughout American homes by the turn of the 20th century. Photographer: [Caroline Sharpnack](https://www.carolinesharpnack.com) But traditional wallpaper hasn't always been the safest answer for wallcoverings. In fact, during the Victorian era, [brightly colored wallpapers contained arsenic](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/victorian-wallpaper-got-its-gaudy-colors-poison-180962709/) (copper arsenite) to get the vivid greens people desired. Unfortunately, these wallpapers made people, and especially children, very ill. In some cases, people hallucinated and were driven mad by the wallpaper. Today's wallpaper is much safer in that it doesn't contain arsenic. But there are still some concerns with certain wallpapers [containing toxins like PVC (polyvinylchloride) and other chemicals](https://www.wellbydesign.com/post/8-tips-to-avoid-off-gassing-and-bioaccumulation-the-problem-with-the-new-carpet-smell). PVC is a petroleum-based chemical. Like many of these chemicals, PVC off-gasses VOCs (volatile organic compounds) that can lead to many issues, from headaches to hormonal disruptions. Older wallpapers have also been linked to mildew, dust, fungus, and [the occurrence of \"sick building syndrome,\"](https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/the-wallpaper-in-your-room-is-the-reason-you-fall-sick-it-hides-dangerous-fungus/story-vzugzIIK1xRciShalVLXyK.html) where people fall ill due to toxins in their environment. So, while wallpaper can be beautiful, it's essential to select nontoxic wallpaper to avoid these potential hazards. Photographer: [Caroline Sharpnack](https://www.carolinesharpnack.com) Fortunately, there are many beautiful nontoxic wallpapers on the market. If you're exploring wallpaper for your home, you'll want to look at the paper material (such as organic fibers, wood, or recycled materials). You'll also want to look at the ink used to create the design. Water-based inks are generally safer. You should also look at the wallpaper certifications and any indication that the paper is PVC-free or otherwise safe. Don't limit yourself to paper-only, either. Many other options, like fabrics, grasscloths, and cork, can make interesting and lovely wallcoverings. Many of these alternative coverings are sold alongside wallpaper, and they are often healthy, sustainable, and beautiful. Keep in mind that it's not only about finding healthy wallpaper and wallcoverings. The paste is also a potential source of concern. Many wallpaper pastes contain VOCs and toxic metals that can be dangerous. One popular alternative is [cellulose paste](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/mix-cellulose-wallpaper-paste-72573.html), which you can buy premade or make yourself. Cellulose is a fiber derived from plants, making it safe and nontoxic. Many peel-and-stick wallpapers contain PVC, so you want to be mindful of this and potentially seek out non-pasted papers and wallcoverings. Photographer: [Caroline Sharpnack](https://www.carolinesharpnack.com) Finally, it's important to note that many wallpapers contain flame-retardant chemicals, which can also be toxic. These will often be listed in the description. They may also contain fungicides which can be harmful. Ecofriendly wallpapers and nontoxic wallpapers often forgo these chemicals\u2014important if you or your family members are chemically sensitive or concerned about the effects. As with all [nontoxic approaches to home d\u00e9cor](https://www.wellbydesign.com/post/nontoxic-interior-design), it's a good idea to do your best to find something you like and feel good about. It's virtually impossible to create a completely nontoxic home because [we don't live in a toxin-free world.](https://www.wellbydesign.com/post/the-scents-of-home-your-guide-to-7-nontoxic-home-fragrance-options) I find it's better not to stress too much about it (obviously stress can detract from your wellness too). Do a little background research and opt for papers and manufacturers that you feel good about\u2014then don't sweat the small stuff. Nontoxic Wallpaper Options If you're looking for nontoxic wallpaper choices, there are quite a few on the market today. As people realize the importance of selecting healthier products for their homes, I think manufacturers will continue to respond with more nontoxic options. [Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/) Spoonflower seems to be number one on everyone's list of the best nontoxic wallpaper sources. One look at their site, and you can quickly see why. They have so many beautiful wallpapers to choose from. In addition, they work with independent artists to create charming fabrics and wallpapers with healthy, sustainable materials. They're one of the few sources of nontoxic (PVC-free) peel-and-stick wallpapers, as well as a wide range of traditional pre-pasted and non-pasted varieties. Spoonflower uses water-based inks and dyes on their papers, and their products are durable and high-quality. [Kelly Ventura Designs](https://www.kellyventura.com/collections/wallpaper) One of my personal favorite wallpaper designers, Kelly Ventura, is a watercolor artist who designs a gorgeous line of sustainable, nontoxic wallpapers.
