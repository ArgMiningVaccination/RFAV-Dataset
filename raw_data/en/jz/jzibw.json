This includes our skin too, which is the largest organ of our body. Though all parts of our body age, it is ageing of skin that gains maximum attention because it clearly visible. We always seeks out different ways to delay this visible skin agein.1 Ageing skin, especially on the face, affects self-image and has many social and emotional implications.2 The signs of ageing skin are clearly visible, like wrinkling, sagging, and a blotchy, uneven skin tone.3 Causes of Sagging Skin: There are many reasons why skin becomes saggy as we age. These reasons may be internal (Intrinsic aging) or external (Extrinsic aging).2 Intrinsic aging Intrinsic aging develops over years as time passes. The speed at which intrinsic aging occurs can vary from one individual to another. Let's see what exactly happens in intrinsic aging.2 Reduction in Elastin: Elastin is a protein that provides tightness and elasticity to the skin. As one ages the amount of elastin in the skin reduces resulting in the skin losing its suppleness and resilience, causing skin to hang loose. Reduction in Collagen: Collagen's main function is to keep the skin taut and firm. As one's age increases, the amount of collagen in the skin becomes lesser.4 Loss of fat: Loss of fat under the skin contributes to the sagging of the skin, especially the face.3 Structural changes: With age, the fat pads under the skin shrink and there is reorganisation of the soft tissues along with bony alternations, especially on the face.3 Effect of Gravity: Gravity can also cause shifting of fats under the skin causing the overlying skin to displace, making it appear saggy and wrinkled.2 Extrinsic aging Extrinsic aging happens due to the external factors as follows:3 Exposure to sun and ageing causes skin damage resulting in production of abnormal type of elastin, which doesn't provide the same kind of elasticity as seen in young people.5 Skin damage by sun exposure causes a significant decrease in the amount of collagen.6 Smoking, pollution, poor diet, alcohol consumption and exposure to UV radiation from the sun significantly contribute to ageing.1 Tightening of skin need not be a costly affair! Read along for several natural home remedies that can help in firming up loose skin. Oils 1. Argan oil: Traditionally, Argan oil has been used in hair and skin care products.

It also prevents skin damage caused by UV radiation, which is one of the very important causes of extrinsic ageing7. 3. Avocado oil: Avocado oil is known to increase the production of collagen7., the main component that helps maintain the tightness of skin, thus preventing sagging and loose skin.5 How to use oils for skin firming?

Drinking enough water (more than 2 liters) is necessary to maintain the moisture levels of the skin. It is better to avoid smoking and heavy alcohol intake as they have a significant contribution to the ageing of the skin.1 The use of an appropriate moisturizer helps lock in moisture, providing hydration and helps keep the skin smooth.14 Application of sunscreen with a SPF of at least 15, is an essential step in skincare so as to prevent sun damage to the skin.15 Conclusion: With all these tips and simple home remedies, you need not resort to artificial and expensive cosmetics, to tackle saggy skin! Just look into your kitchen and you will find fresh and natural ways to maintain supple smooth skin! Can I go for surgical procedures for skin tightening? While surgery for sagging skin ('surgical lift ') can give the most radical results, one might not be the ideal candidate for it. For example, skin tightening procedures are not recommended for expecting mothers, people on certain medications and if someone has a skin infection. Consult a skin specialist to know if you can go for surgery for sagging skin.16 Do these home remedies give permanent skin tightening effect? There are no scientific studies available which show that the effect of skin tightening by home remedies is permanent. However, since there are no side effects, if you see results, you can continue them in regularly. Apart from home remedies, are there any other ways to improve tightness without going for surgery? Yes, you may opt for commercially available skin tightening lotions and creams or for non-invasive skin firming procedures like laser treatment, ultrasound or radiofrequency after consulting a skin specialist.16 Can I be allergic to any of the home remedies mentioned here? Yes, to be cautious about not breaking out into an allergy due to any of the remedies mentioned here, you may ask your doctor to conduct a skin patch test for you. The skin patch test is a simple, non-invasive test which can detect allergic reactions to any substance.17 Swift A, Liew S, Weinkle S, Garcia J, Silberberg M.
