Okay, that's not true. I've got nothing against a good juice cleanse! After all, green juice is the official spokesperson of the superfoods. But after overindulging in February, the month of \"self-love,\" my goal is to say goodbye to all the bad stuff residing in my body. There's something people don't always advertise about detoxes. They don't have to be expensive. You don't need to buy a detox kit. A natural detox can be as fancy or as simple as you want. Need some inspiration? Try adding these 11 foods to your diet - or your juice cleanse. Goji Berries We all know vitamin C is what you need to avoid getting sick, but it also helps your body remove unwanted waste. Goji berries are also packed with beta-carotene, which keeps your liver healthy. Flaxseeds Did you know there's a thing called the Flaxseed Cleanse? No? Imagine being so powerful, there was a whole cleanse just for you. Enter flaxseed. I could write 500 words on the benefits of flaxseed, but I'll stick with the detox facts. Lowers cholesterol. Reduces inflammation. Removes waste in the liver. Eliminates debt. That last one isn't true (hint hint: we're joking), but you get the point. Ginger Good in tea. Good in sushi. Ginger is as versatile as it is flavorful, which is probably why it's medicinal purposes have been praised for thousands of years. No matter how you use it, ginger will spike your metabolism, flush out water, and aide with inflammation. Beets Once considered a food for your grandparents, beets are having their much-deserved moment. This root vegetable is packed with magnesium, iron, zinc, and calcium, all crucial to keeping your body free of toxins. Red Cabbage Personally, I have been on the cabbage train for a while and I've got my fingers crossed they get their moment much like beets. Cabbage is one of the most potent sources of antioxidants, which makes it perfect for a detox. Add this to your diet to support the natural function of your liver and keep your digestive system clear. Green Tea Is it really a detox list without green tea? The answer is no. Green tea is worth the hype! It's high in all the good antioxidants your body craves while flushing out your liver. Garlic If you need an extra reason to double-triple the amount of garlic a recipe calls for, I am here to give you one. Garlic is considered a detox superfood, notably for removing heavy metals from your body. Cinnamon [Cinnamon](https://perfectbar.com/5-spices-boost-health-flavor/) is right up there with garlic when it comes to ancient detox foods. It reduces inflammation, helps with weight loss, regulates blood sugar levels, and keeps your heart happy. Blueberries A true healing food, blueberries contain natural aspirin, meaning it reduces inflammation and associated pain. It also acts as an antibiotic, helping to prevent infections. But wait, there's more! They also help block toxins from crossing the blood-brain barrier. Keep your brain safe and your body healthy. Seaweed When it's not hitching a ride around your legs in the ocean, this algae is packing a mean, green punch. Containing 10 to 20 times more minerals than most vegetables, seaweed absorbs toxins from the digestive tract and helps reduce inflammation. Lemons There's a reason everyone wants lemon with their water - and it's not just for the added taste. This well-loved citrus helps convert toxins into a water-soluble form allowing unwanted substances to flush out of your body. Now that you have 10 new items on your grocery list, it's time to detox. Maybe you're a detox pro or maybe this is your first time. Either way, listen to your body. Detoxing doesn't require you to make extreme diet choices. At its core, a natural detox is simply adding some good stuff to your body to get rid of the bad stuff. And isn't that what we should be striving for in every area of our life anyway?
