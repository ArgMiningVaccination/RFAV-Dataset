If you have been suffering from brain fog, depression, anemia, allergies, eczema, mood swings, chronic fatigue, poor concentration, burning skin and anxiety, it's a good bet that toxins have accumulated in your body. Toxins are just one of several interferences to a normal functioning body; but because of our consistent exposure to them and their often undetectable sources, they continue to pose one of the most serious threats to our health and well-being. Toxins are created internally from the waste by-products of cell metabolism during things like exercise and digestion; and externally from pesticides, cleaning solvents and/or disinfectants, heavy metals and food additives. What the body cannot excrete through sweat, urine, and feces becomes entrapped in the cells of the body that govern your very existence\u2014in nerve cells, fat cells, bones, teeth and organs. This creates an overload on the body, which weakens the immune system. Some interpret this as the aging process\u2014arthritis, heart disease, degenerative disk disease, diabetes, and difficulty with weight management. Despite the efforts by various watchdog and regulatory groups toward increased awareness for our safety, we inevitably become exposed to environmental pollutants on a daily basis. Today, there are approximately 80,000 chemicals in commercial use; however, studies show that our bodies cannot metabolize over 20,000 of these chemicals and that we have between 400 and 800 chemical residues regularly stored in the fat cells of the body. Chemicals such as pyrethoids, the main ingredient in many pesticides, can alter hormone function in low doses and are toxic to the nervous system in high doses. Other chemicals are found in 80% of supermarket foods when they become processed or made for shelf life. Processed foods force the body to \"burn the metabolic candle at both ends,\" since it must use additional energy, vitamins, minerals, co-factors and co-enzymes stored in the body to break down the unnatural food elements. Perhaps the largest contributors of environment toxins are heavy metals. They are found in the three core elements we depend on daily to stay alive\u2014air, water and soil (food). According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, \"Since metals build up in your body over time, symptoms are often attributed to other causes and people often don't realize that they have been affected by metals until it's too late...[causing] irreversible damage.\" Mercury, Lead, Aluminum, Arsenic and Cadmium are the most common toxic metals. Mercury is one of the most damaging neurotoxins known. Its toxicity is generated by vapors from mercury-based fillings in the teeth, by injection into the bloodstream as part of a vaccine, and by ingesting it from contaminated fish. Dental amalgams are in 78% of all Americans and are recognized as \"safe, affordable and durable\" by the ADA, yet studies show that 95% of all people with nervous system disorders such as MS, epilepsy, paralysis and migraines also have dental fillings with mercury in them. Furthermore, people with amalgams are exposed to vapors 10X greater than those without them and is worsened when brushing teeth, drinking hot liquids and chewing gum. Most vaccines contain a mercury preservative known as Thimerosal. The EPA has determined that the amount of mercury in a vaccine is 50 times more than the recommended limit for human safety to an adult individual. Imagine the exposure to a developing infant with 59 vaccines currently being \"required\" prior to the age of 18. Many experts agree that neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and ADD/ADHD, are directly linked to toxic levels of mercury in vaccines and the infant's inability to eliminate the mercury from the brain. Non-mercury based vaccines are available, but are in limited supply since they are cost prohibitive to the manufacturer. When in doubt, ask to see the packaging.

Unfortunately, industrial pollutants are also contaminating fish, whose Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids are found to be one of the healthiest fats on the planet for optimal function in the brain, blood, cells, muscles, skin and numerous other tissues. Larger fish in the food chain will have the most toxins in them. Despite the recognized pollutants in the ocean, avoid fish that is farm-raised, and go for the wild fish instead when buying it from the store. Furthermore, \"fresh\" fish doesn't always mean it is wild. I recommend the Tilapia or Salmon. If you're purchasing Omega-3 EFA Supplements, be sure to look for a description on the label about the oil being purified through a molecular distillation process. Otherwise, I would avoid it altogether. Lead exposure mainly occurs through lead-based paints and gasolines, lead batteries, rubber products, as well as lead-contaminated water and glass. Lead-based paints pose the biggest threats here since they still exist on an estimated 64 million homes and commercial properties. Lead exposure is known to affect children more than adults, and can cause hypertension, kidney dysfunction and poor brain development. Aluminum is absorbed into the body through drinking contaminated water, anti-perspirants, aluminum foil, aluminum cookware, over-the-counter drugs, some baking powders as well as refined foods, flours and processed cheeses. High Aluminum exposure has been implicated in Alzheimer's Disease. Arsenic is absorbed into the body through drinking contaminated water, sawdust from freshly cut wood treated with arsenic, and/or from an occupational hazard of pesticide use. Liver, kidney, bladder, prostate and skin cancer can be caused by long-term exposure to Arsenic. Cadmium is absorbed through drinking contaminated water, food, cigarette smoke and occupational hazards from battery manufacturing, welding and metal soldering. Although it is a naturally occurring metal, it is extremely carcinogenic and can harm DNA and the DNA repair process. Exposure to high levels of Cadmium can lead to liver disease, hypertension and neurological damage. Removing Toxins Nutrition. Chlorella and Chlorophyll are two of the most powerful green foods since they act like magnets for heavy metals as they pass through your body. Buy organic fruits and vegetables and eat them raw when possible. If food is cooked beyond 116-118, it will destroy most or all of the active enzymes in food. Various purifications programs are also available that range from 2 to 60 days for cleansing the blood, organs and other tissues. Massage. Lymphatic Drainage Massage can be very effective in stimulating the lymphatic system to mobilize the toxins in the body and release them through appropriate channels (skin, colon, urine and respirations). Foot Bath. The foot bath utilizes Himalayan mineral salts and special electronic equipment in a medically approved process known as Peritoneal Dialysis (Osmosis). After just 35 minutes, you will feel more balanced, cleansed, relaxed and refreshed. Infrared Sauna. The infrared sauna utilizes far infrared light, a natural band of light invisible to the human eye but felt as heat. According to High Tech Health, \"Unlike the heat produced in traditional saunas, far infrared heat is able to penetrate the body to a depth of 1 \u00bd to 2 inches...and [encourages] a slight rise in body temperature that boosts natural detoxification systems.\" It's important to remember that the time taken for most toxins to evoke a symptom or dysfunction in the body is usually months or years, and it may take an equal amount of time for the toxins to be removed. Over the next few weeks, think about all the things discussed in this article that may be contributing to a toxic burden on your body so you can [take action now](https://www.drkentencinitas.com/contact.html) and prevent problems from developing later in life.
