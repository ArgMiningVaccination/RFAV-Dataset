There are over 2000 acupuncture points shown to be effective in the treatment of many health problems. These points are mapped to 14 major meridian lines, one meridian for each of the 12 inner organs. Two of the major meridians are located along the spine and down the midline of the abdomen. Acupuncture needles are typically not much thicker than a strand of hair and their insertion is practically painless. In some cases you may not even know the needles are in place. In others, there may be some tingling, warmth, heaviness, or a feeling of Qi, such as achiness or heaviness, moving up or down the meridians. Most people find acupuncture extremely relaxing.
