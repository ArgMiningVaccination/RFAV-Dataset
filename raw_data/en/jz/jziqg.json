From collaborative programs that address obesity and diabetes, to raising awareness about mental illness and teenage alcohol abuse, to free support groups and participation in community health and safety programs, these partnerships are vital to making our community a healthier place.LETTER FROM THE CEO The Scripps story began with a strong commitment to the San Diego community - a commitment that continues today. Our founders, Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings, were both women ahead of their time. Their commitment to provide for the health care needs of a growing community resulted in the Scripps Health of today. Miss Ellen, as she was known, preferred the term \"investment\" over \"donation\", and her contributions were carefully considered as much for their future promise as for their immediate impact. Decades earlier, Mother Mary Michael's patient logs illustrated her fundamental mission to make quality health care available to all who needed it. Today, more than 15,000 employees , physicians and volunteers continue to build on our rich history and keep the spirit of community service alive. The pages that follow provide a comprehensive account of how we achieve that: our community benefit programs and services, and our plans for continued action in the future. In Fiscal Year 2018 , Scripps' community benefit contributions totaled $395,361,567. This includes $358,318,252 in uncompensated care, $ 26,757,826 in professional education and health research, $1, 133,020 in community building activities, $ 5,384,683 in community health services and $3,817,785 in subsidized health. Health care will continue to change in San Diego and across our country. At Scripps we are continually changing to better meet our patients' needs , improve access in our community , reduce our costs, and simply bring more value to the patients we serve. When Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings brought quality health care to San Diego around 100 years ago, they could never have imagined the care we provided today or the more than 70 0,000 lives we touch each year. As a private, tax -exempt health care system, Scripps will continue our legacy of making a vital and measurable difference in our community. Chris Van Gorder, FACHE President and CEO MISSION, VISION , AND VALUES OUR MISSION Scripps strives to provide superior health services in a caring environment and to make a positive, measurable difference in the health of individuals in the communities we serve.

Scripps cares for people throughout San Diego with four acute care hospitals on five campuses, 29 outpatient locations, and a home health network. Three highly respected graduate medical education programs and two pharmacy resident programs train the next generation of caregivers. Operating revenue: $3,243 billion Operating expenses: Assistance Assisting Low-Income, Uninsured Patients Scripps' financial assistance policy reflects our commitment to assisting low income and uninsured patients with discounted hospital charges, charity care, and flexible billing and debt collection practices. These programs are consistent with state and federal legislation, and are available to everyone in need, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, religion or national origin.3Oncology Nurse Navigators Guide Patients Through Care When someone learns they have cancer, their life can change in an instant. In addition to concerns about their future and how the disease will affect their loved ones, cancer patients may suddenly find themselves navigating multiple appointments, tests and treatments, as well as logistical questions and emotional issues. It's no wonder that a cancer diagnosis often feels overwhelming. To help patients manage these challenges, Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center has been expanding its nurse navigator program. Nurses who are specially trained in oncology (the study and treatment of cancer), nurse navigators provide support and encouragement to help patients through their cancer journey into survivorship. Navigators contact patients who are newly diagnosed with cancer, ensure that they understand all tests and procedures, and let them know what to expect from their care. They also provide education, help coordinate appointments and facilitate communication between patients and their care teams. All of this helps empower patients to make informed decisions and play an active role in their care. In addition, nurse navigators provide compassionate guidance by helping patients deal with treatment side effects and identifying support groups, classes and events, and other community resources. They also offer family members and caregivers support to guide their loved ones to the best possible outcome. Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center currently has nine nurse navigators partnering with patients and plans to add three in the coming year. 4 Family Medicine Residents Care for Students at School-Based Clinics In collaboration with the Sweetwater Union High School District and San Ysidro Health, Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program developed school-based clinics at Palomar High School in 2003 and Southwest High School in 2007. Based on the needs of students and families, the clinics provide a wide scope of services, including sports physicals, mental health assessments and treatment, and preventive health education. Both clinics collaborate closely with school personnel to identify students at risk and families in need of clinic services. Family medicine residents not only improve access to care and build their adolescent medicine skills, they serve as role models and support students who have an interest in pursuing health-related careers. Food Finders Partnership Feeds Families in Need Through a new partnership between Scripps Corporate Food Service and Food Finders, a nonprofit group that distributes food to people in need, all leftover food from Scripps corporate facilities is packaged, picked up each day and transferred to the Scripps 4S Ranch Food and Nutrition Services freezer for storage. Food Finders picks up the frozen food twice per week and transports it to one of its facilities to help feed our community. \"This community outreach from Scripps with the help of the nonprofit is what we are about at the end of the day,\" said Fri Reyes, director of culinary services for Scripps Corporate Food Service. \"We were able to touch more lives and offer a more positive culinary change that our less-fortunate neighbors desperately need.\" Left: Students learned how to dress up in sterile gowns, and apply and remove surgical staples on pumpkins. Right: Hoover High School, UCSD first-year medical students, and Scripps Family Medicine residents. The hand movements represents the school's mascot. 5Scripps Offers Students Mental Health Support Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program and Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Well-Being Center have partnered with San Diego State University to improve overall mental health care for local high school students through a school-based clinic at Southwest High School. Students earning their master's degrees in social work at SDSU work with local behavioral health providers and Scripps family medicine residents to address mental health issues of vulnerable adolescents, including core issues such as anxiety and depression. Parkinson's Event Empowers Hundreds It was a day of hope and inspiration for hundreds of San Diegans living with Parkinson's disease. In November 2018, more than 300 guests learned new ways to take control of their health at the Empowerment for Parkinson's Day at Marina Village. From the benefits of exercise and diet change to massage, acupuncture and even music therapy, attendees left the event armed with knowledge to help make positive changes. Empowerment for Parkinson's was the culmination of work that began 10 years ago. Several Scripps physicians and employees decided to create a motivational day of exercise, confidence-building and education that included neurologists, psychologists, integrative doctors, exercise specialists, physical therapists and more. From this, the annual Keep Moving with Parkinson's Bootcamp was born. Following the May 2017 bootcamp, the Parkinson's Association of San Diego (PASD) asked the team to share their model to create an even larger-scale event. Through the partnership with PASD and others, more people than ever before who attended the event discovered options to alleviate their symptoms and improve their quality of life. 6 Trauma Holds First San Diego County Lifeguard Education Conference The trauma catchment area for Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla includes most of the San Diego County coastline \u2014 and lifeguards are often the first responders to beach-related emergencies. In July 2018, the trauma department at Scripps La Jolla hosted the first San Diego County Lifeguard Education Conference. More than 150 permanent and seasonal lifeguards representing all 11 San Diego County lifeguard agencies learned vital information about topics, including beach injuries and illnesses, drowning resuscitation, shark attacks, sand entrapment and spinal cord injuries, as well as skin cancer prevention tips for the lifeguards themselves. \"You did an incredible job and it is so appreciated,\" said Mike Silvestri, lifeguard supervisor from California State Parks. The trauma department plans to continue this partnership to provide education and help lifeguards further identify opportunities for community outreach and injury prevention. 7Scripps Provides Hepatitis A Vaccines to At-Risk Populations Scripps Health builds awareness of disaster preparedness and actively responds to events to affect change at the community level. Following the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, Scripps developed a system-wide disaster preparedness program and moved quickly to integrate disaster preparedness throughout the organization's operations. The Scripps Medical Response Team (SMRT) arose from these efforts, and prepares Scripps to respond to emergencies at local, state, national and international levels. In Fiscal Year 2018, when San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer asked Scripps to help address the Hepatitis A outbreak, the Scripps SMRT team worked directly with city and county public health officials to make vaccinations accessible to individuals at risk of the highly contagious virus. SMRT teams, including physicians, nurses and support personnel, administered vaccinations and provided education on Hepatitis A at three county-sponsored housing sites over multiple dates and times. Each site housed numerous occupants, many of whom had risk factors, including homelessness or substance abuse recovery. Occupants were notified in advance that Scripps would be offering vaccinations without cost. For their own protection, all volunteers were required to show proof of immunity to Hepatitis A or get vaccinated prior to the outreach. SMRT volunteers vaccinated approximately 100 people against Hepatitis A; Scripps staff then entered their vaccination history into the San Diego Immunization Program webpage to track all individuals who received the vaccine. This helped prevent unnecessary revaccination of people who came to local emergency departments and primary care offices for care. Because the risk factors associated with the outbreak persist in our community, Scripps employee health offers Hep A vaccinations to all employees considered at risk, especially those who work in the emergency department, behavioral health and food service. Seniors Lunch and Learn with Scripps Scripps offers monthly hot lunch and senior health chats to more than 30 at-risk seniors at St. Charles Nutrition Center and Norman Park Center. The senior health chats cover a variety of timely topics, including heart health, diabetes, osteoporosis, healthy holidays and more. It's a wonderful opportunity for our local health professionals, family medicine residents, public health students and Scripps community staff to provide public health and social service education. \u00a9 2019 Scripps Health, (4/19) MCOM-1391High School Exploration Program Alumna Addresses Graduates Students who participate in the annual Scripps High School Exploration Program spend five weeks of summer break at Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas, Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, Scripps Green Hospital, Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego, or Scripps Mercy Hospital, Chula Vista, learning first-hand about medical careers, rotating through departments and working alongside our medical professionals. Recently, two-time Explorer alumna Ellen Douglas spoke to the 2018 Explorer graduates. Now a second- year osteopathic medical student at Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences in Yakima, Washington, Ellen shared her thoughts with graduates on how the program impacted her career choice. \"I found my path to medicine through personal experience with family illness, coupled with a passion for science and a desire to help others,\" Ellen said. \"By far the most impactful program that shaped my development as an aspiring health care professional was the Scripps Exploration Program.\" Growing up in Ramona, Ellen saw the challenges of living in a medically underserved community without immediate access to hospital services. \"If it were not for the Scripps High School Exploration Program, I would have never seen first-hand what superior health services looks like from such a young age. Whether I was standing over an open-heart surgery, following the trauma team up to Life Flight, serving patients lunch with the cafeteria staff, or working with the environmental services team to clean up after surgery, it was inspiring to witness how each department works together in synergy to provide the best patient experience and outcomes in a caring environment,\" she said. \"It was through my experience with the Scripps health care professionals that I truly witnessed what premiere patient-centered care looks like and saw the future doctor I aspire to be.\" For more information about the programs and services offered by Scripps Health, visit scripps.org/communitybenefit or contact the Scripps Health Office of Community Benefit Services at 858-678-7095 .

Passed in 1994, the bill requires California's, not -for-profit hospitals to annually describe and document the full range of community benefits they provide. Scripps has taken this legislative requirement a step further. This report incorporates not only documentation of community benefits, but also a more detailed explanation of the specific community benefit activities provided by our five acute- care hospital campuses, home health care, wellness centers and ambulatory care clinics. The report details programs and services that provide community benefits above and beyond standard practices of care. It is divided into three primary category areas: Community Health Services Professional Education and Health Research Uncompensated Care The report covers the period of October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018 (Fiscal Year 2018). During this fiscal year, Scripps devoted $395,361,567 to community benefit programs and services in the three areas listed above (see figures 1:1 and 1:2). Our programs emphasize commu nity-based prevention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greatest risk for health problems. Definitions of terms used in this report can be found in Appendix A. The documentation and activities described in this report are commitme nts we make to improve the health of both our patients and the diverse San Diego communities. As a longstanding member of these communities, and as a not -for-profit community resource, our goal and responsibility are to assist all who come to us for care, and to reach out especially to those who find themselves vulnerable and without support. This responsibility is an intrinsic part of our mission. Through our continued actions and community partnerships, we strive to raise the quality of life in the community as a whole. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 1 Community benefit is defined as programs or activities that provide treatment of promote health and healing in response to an identified community need. Community benefit programs must meet at least one of the following criteria: Respond to a public health need. Involve education or research that improves overall community health. Respond to needs of special populations Supply services or programs that would likely be discounted if the design was made on a purely financial basis because that operate at a financial loss. SCHEDULE H (FORM 990) Hospitals with tax -exempt status are required to provide information specific to their organization on Schedule H, Form 990 (the annual information return filed by tax - exempt organizations.) The entire Schedule H was mandatory beginning with tax year 2009 1 Scripps has aligned the 20 19 Community Benefit Plan and R eport to the Schedule H categories. According to the IRS, community building activities, bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reported, but not included in the community benefit totals.

Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) originated from California state w ide legislation in the early 1990s. SB 697 took effect in 1995, which required private not -for-profit hospitals to submit detailed information to the Office of Statewide health Planning and development (OSHPD) on their community benefit contributions. Annual hospital community benefit reports are summarized by OSHPD in a Report to the Legislature, which provides valuable information for government officials to assess the care and services prov ided to their constituents. The SB 697 requirement was supplemented in 2010 by requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA that not-for-profit hospitals conduct community health needs assessments with community stake holders to determine significant health needs of the community they serve and Implementation Strategies to help meet those needs. Additional information on the ACA requirements for not -for-profit hospitals can be found at http://www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations.\" For more detailed information on the CHNA regulatory requirements and Implementation Strategy see Appendix E. As part of the federal reporting requirement for private, not-for-profit (tax exempt) hospitals, Scripps conducts a consolidated Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and corresponding joint Implementations strategy for its licensed hospital facilities every three years. This comprehensive account of health needs in the community is designed for hospi tals to plan their community benefit programs together with other local health care institutions, community -based organizations and consumer groups. The 2016 Scripps Health CHNA is designed to provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County. The report will help us better understand our community's health needs, and inform community benefit planning and the Implementation Strategy for Scripps Health. In addition, the assessment allows interested parties and members of th e community mechanism to access the full spectrum of information relative to the development of the Scripps Health 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment Report. Scripps strives to improve community health through collaboration. Working with other health systems, community groups, government agencies, businesses and grassroots movements, Scripps is better able to build upon existing assets to achieve broad community health goals. The complete report is available online at Scripps Health 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment Report. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 6 CHNA EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Executive Summary provides a high- level summary of the 2016 CHNA methodology and findings. The full CHNA report contains in- depth information and explanations of the data that participating hospitals and healthcare systems will use to evaluate the health needs of their pati ents and determine, adapt, or create programs at their facilities Grounded in a longstanding commitment to address community health needs in San Diego, seven hospitals and health care systems, including Scripps Health came together under the auspices of th e Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) to conduct a triennial Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) that identifies and prioritizes the most critical health- related needs of San Diego County residents. Participating hospital s will use the findings to guide their community programs and meet IRS regulatory requirements. Per legislation hospitals conduct a health needs assessment in the community once every three years. Based on the findings from the 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and recommendations from the community, the 2016 CHNA was designed to provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County. Participating hospitals will use this information to inform and guide hospital programs and strategies. This report includes an analysis of health outcomes and associated social determinants of health which create health inequities - 'the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries 2 and communities- with the understanding that the burden of illness, premature death, and disability disproportionally affects racial and minority population groups and other underserved populations3. Understanding regional and population- specific differences is an import ant step to understanding and ultimately strategizing ways to make collective impact. These new insights will allow participating hospitals to identify effective strategies to address the most prevalent and challenging health needs in the community. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 7 2 World Health Organization.

Accessed March 2016 3 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; HHS action plan to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities: A nation free of disparities in health and health care (Washington, DC:U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health, 2011), http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/plans/hhs/hhs_plan_complete.pdf OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND In May 2015, HASD&IC contracted with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University (SDSU) to provide assistance with the collaborative health needs assessment that was officially called the HASD&IC 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (2016 CHNA). The objective of the 2016 CHNA is to identify and prioritize the most critical health -related needs in San Diego County based on feedback from community residents in high need neighborhoods and quantitative data analysis. The 2016 CHNA involve d a mixed methods approach using the most current quantitative data available and more extensive qualitative outreach. Throughout the process, the IPH met bi -weekly with the HASD&IC CHNA committee to analyzed, refine, and interpret results as they were bei ng collected. The results of the 2016 CHNA will be used to inform and adapt hospital programs and strategies to better meeting the health needs of San Diego County residents. COMMUNITY DEFINED For the purposes of this 2016 CHNA, the service area is defined as the entire County of San Diego due to a broad representation of hospitals in the area. Over three million people live in the socially and ethnically diverse County of San Diego. Select key demographic information is summarized in Figure 2:1 below. F IGURE 2:1. SELECTED COMMUNITY STATISTICS *Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is a measure of income issued every year by the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2019, the FPL for a family of four at 200 percent federal poverty level was $ 51,500. Additional information on socioeconomic factors, access to care, health behaviors, and the physical environment can be found in the full Scripps 2016 CHNA report at Scripps Health 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment Report. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 8 Because of its large geographic size and population, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) organized their service areas into six geographic regions. Central, East, North Central, North Coastal, North Inland and South. When possible, data is presented at a regional level to provide more detailed underst anding of the population. The geographical regions are represented below in Figure 2:2. FIGURE 2:2. SAN DIEGO COUNTY WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY REGION 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 9 SCRIPPS HEALTH COMMUNITY SERVED Hospitals and health care systems define the community served as those individuals residing within its service area. A hospital or health care system service area includes all residents in a defined geographic area surrounding the hospital. Scripps serves the entire San Diego county region with services concentrated in North Coastal, North Central, Central and Southern region of San Diego. Community outreach efforts are focused in those areas with proximity to a Scripps facility. Scripps hosts, sponsors and participates in many community -building events throughout the year.

FIGURE 2:3 SCRIPPS HEALTH SERVICE AREA 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 11 COMMUNITY PRIORITY PROCESS (CHNA METHODOLOGY ) The aim of the 2016 CHNA methodology was to provide a more complete understanding of the top four identified health needs and associated social determinants of health in the San Diego community. The 2013 methodology used to identify the top four health needs is described in Figure 2:4. FIGURE 2:4 HASD&IC 2013 CHNA METHODOLOGY *For a complete description of the HASD&IC 2013 process and findings, see full report available at https://www.hasdic.org/2016- chna When the results of all of the data and information gathered in 2013 were combined, four conditions emerged clearly as the top community health needs in San Diego County (in alphabetical order). 1.

Figure 2:5 provides an overview of the process used to identify and prioritize the health needs for the HASD&IC 2016 CHNA. For the purposes of the CHNA, a \"health need\" is defined as a health outcome and/or the related conditions that contribute to a defined health outcome. F IGURE 2:5. 2016 CHNA PROCESS MAP 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 13 The 2016 CHNA process began with a comprehensive scan of recent community health statistics in order to validate the regional significance of the top four health needs identified in the 2013 CHNA. Quantitative data for both the HASD&IC 2016 CHNA and SMH 20 16 CHNA included 2013 OSHPD demographic data for hospital inpatient, emergency department (ED), and ambulatory care encounters to understand the hospital patient population. Clinic data was also gathered from OSHPD's website and incorporated in order to pr ovide a more holistic view of health care utilization in SDC. The variables analyzed are included in Table 2:3 below and were analyzed at the ZIP code level wherever possible. TABLE 2:3 . VARIABLES ANALYZED IN THE HASD&IC AND SMH 2016 CHNA S Secondary Data Variables Hospital Utilization: Inpatient discharges, ED and ambulatory care encounters Community Clinic Visits Demographic Data (socio -economic indicators) Mortality and Morbidity Data Regional Program Data (childhood obesity trends and community resource referral patterns) Social Determinants of Health and Health Behaviors (education, income, insurance, physical enforcement, physical activity, diet and substance abuse) IDENTIFY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES Recognizing that health needs differ across the region and that socioeconomic factors impact health outcomes, the IPH used the Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Need Index (CNI) to identify communities within San Diego County with the highest level of health disparities and needs. The CNI score is an average of five different barrier scores that measure various socioeconomic indicators of each community using the 2013 source data. The five barriers used to determine CNI scores are : CNI Color Scale Income barrier Culture barrier Educational barrier Insurance barrier Housing barrier 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 14 The map shown below is based on CNI score for San Diego County area of high need (CNI score of 4 to 5) are individuals with red or orange while areas of low need (CNI score of 1 to 3 are yellow or green). The CNI data and the hospital discharge rate by primary diagnosis for the health conditions: Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and behavioral health.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY COMMUNITY NEED INDEX , 2013 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 15 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES Community engagement activities wer e conducted with a broad range of people including heath experts, community leaders, and San Diego residents, in an effort to gain a more complete understanding of the top identified health needs in the San Diego community. Individuals who were consulted i ncluded representative from state, local tribal, or other regional governmental public health departments (or equivalent department or agency) as well as leaders, representatives, or members of medically underserved, low income, and minority populations. Figure 2:7 below outlines the number and type of community engagement activities conducted as part of the collaborative HASD&IC 2016 CHNA. Community input was gathered through the following activities: Behavioral Health Discussions Community Partner Discuss ions Key Informant Interviews Health Access and Navigation Survey San Diego County HHSA Survey FIGURE 2:7 . HASD&IC 2016 CHNA COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES The overall purpose of collecting community input was to gather information about the health needs and social determinants specific to San Diego County. Specific objectives included: Gather in depth feedback to aid in the understanding of the most significant health needs impacting San Diego County. Connect the identified health needs with associated social determinants of health. Aid in the process of prioritizing health needs within San Diego County. Gain information about the system and policy changes within San Diego County that could potentially impact the health needs and social determinants of health. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 16 FINDINGS AND PRIORITIZED HEALTH CONDITIONS The Collaborative, HASD&IC 2016 CHNA prioritized the top health needs for San Diego County overall through the application of the following f ive criteria: 1. Magnitude or Prevalence 2. Severity 3. Health Disparities 4. Trends 5. Community Concern Using these criteria, a summary matrix translating the 2016 CHNA findings was created for review by the CHNA Committee. As a result of this review, the CHNA Committ ee identified behavioral health as the number one health need in S an Diego County . In addition, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity were identified as having equal importance due to their interrelatedness. Health needs were further broken down into priority areas due to the overwhelming agreement among all data sources and in recognition of the complexities with each health need. Within the category of behavioral health, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, drug and alcohol issues, and mood disorders are significant health needs in San Diego County. Among the other chronic health needs, hypertension was consistently found to be a significant priority area related to cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes was an important factor leading to complicat ion related to diabetes, and obesity was often found to co- occur with other conditions and contribute to worsening health status. The impact of the top health needs differed among age groups; with Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and anxiety affecting all age groups, drug and alcohol issues affecting teens and adults, and Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension affecting older adults. Figure 2:8 illustrates the prioritization of the tops health needs for S an Diego County . F IGURE 2:8 HASD&IC 2016 CHNA TOP HEALTH NEEDS 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 17 SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH In addition to the health outcome needs that were identified, social determinants of health were a key theme in all of the community engagement activities. Analysis of results from the community partner discussions and key Informant interviews revealed the most commonly associated social determinants of health for each of the top health needs above. Ten social determinants were consiste ntly referenced across the different community engagement activities. The importance of these social determinants was also confirmed by quantitative data. Hospital programs and community collaborations have the potential to impact these social determinants , which are outlined below in order of priority. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 18 FIGURE 2:9 . SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH , HASD&IC 2016 CHNA 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 19 COMMUNITY RECOMMENDATIONS Following the completion of the community engagement activities, all of the different types of feedback were combined and analyzed. Four key categories emerged: overarching strategies to address the top health needs; resources that must be increased or developed to meet the health needs; system, policy and environmental changes that could support better health outcomes, and possible collaborations to improve access and quality of care for vulnerable populations. A compilation of the overarching recommendations is below. FIGURE 2:10 . SUMMARY OF COMMUNITY RECOMMENDATIONS , HASD&IC 2016 CHNA 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 20 2016 CHNA FOLLOW UP SURVEY , PHASE 2 The Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (HASD&IC 2016 CHNA) used a multi -level, hospital -focused analysis to identify the priority community health needs in San Diego County. The CHNA Committee co mpleted Phase 2 of the 2016 CHNA, which included gathering community feedback on the 2016 CHNA process and strengthening partnerships around the identified health needs and social determinants. Two community surveys were conducted in the fall of 2016 and i n the summer of 2017. The results of these community surveys helped guide individual hospital programs and plans, and also helped refine the CHNA process in 2019. The fall 2016 survey was conducted as a follow -up to the Collaborative 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment process that was completed in May of 2016. The purpose was to gather feedback on the identified top four health needs and the top 10 social determinants of health that were identified in the 2016 CHNA. In addition, organizations were asked about their screening methods for behavioral health issues and methods for identifying social determinants of health. An electronic survey was created and a survey link was emailed to community partners. Due to the fact that community partners were able to forward the email to their colleagues the total response rate was unable to be calculated. The survey was open from October 10 th through November 7th, approximately four weeks. A total of 132 respondents completed the survey. Of the 132 respondents that completed the survey, 30 worked in hospitals or hospital - based settings, while the remaining 102 respondents self -identified as working for a range of entities including but not limited to community clinics, not -for-profits, community based organizations, local government, and health insurance plans. A summary of key findings from the survey is presented in the following section. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 21 In addition to soliciting feedback on the findings, the survey also included questions seeking to determine whether the integration of behavioral health and physical health was being integrated locally, as well as whether organizations were screening for and addressing social determinants of health. Ninety nine respondents stated that their organization screens patients and clients about their social determinants of health. Access to care of services topped the list, along with homeless/housing issues and insurance issues (details below in Table 2:4). Ninety four respondents shared information about how they screen patients and document the information. Findings clearly indicate that these organizations are screening patients for social determinants and m aking referrals, but indications are that follow -up is somewhat limited (details below in Table 2:5). There is strong interest on the part of respondents in learning more about the ways that our community partners are screening clients and patients.

Community partners feedback was gathered in order to understand how the health and social needs of communiti es facing inequity have changed over the past year. Feedback was collected in several key areas, including: 1. How has access to care changed over the past 12 months. 2. Ways that hospitals can work more effectively with community organizations to ensure that p atients are treated in the most appropriate setting. 3. How are patients'/clients' concerns about their immigration status impacting their access to needed health care. 4. Given the federal policies and budget cuts that are under consideration, what are the greatest challenges in the community's ability to address social determinants of health. An electronic survey was created and a survey link was emailed to community partners. Due to the fact that community partners were able to forward the email to their colleagues the total response rate was unable to be calculated. The survey was open from July 24th through August 16th, approximately three weeks. A total of 66 respondents completed the survey. Below are some of the results from a few of the survey questions. ACCESS TO CARE CHANGE QUESTION 1. IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS , HOW HAS ACCESS TO CA RE CHANGED FOR YOUR PATIENTS , CLIENTS OR COMMUNITY ? (N=66) In the fall of 2015, as part of the 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) process, a Health Access and Navigation Survey4 was distributed to identify specific barriers residents faced when trying to access healthcare services. The top 5 identified barriers were: 1. Understanding health insurance 2. Getting health insurance 3. Using health insurance 4. Knowing where to go for care 5. Follow -up care and/or appointment 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 23 4 Navigation Survey, Roadmap - Where Do You Get Stuck? Was created in collaboration with the Community Health Improvement Partners & the Resident Leadership Academy Council. As a follow up to this navigation survey, participants were asked how access to care has changed for their patients, clients or community within the past 12 months. The majority of respondents indicated that things are about the same. QUESTION 2. GIVEN THE BARRIERS ID ENTIFIED TO ACCESSIN G CARE , WHAT IS ONE WAY HOSPITALS COULD WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY WIT H COMMUNITY ORGANIZA TIONS TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ARE TR EATED IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE SETTING ? (N=57) The table below shows the categorizations of the open- ended responses. Education (21%), access to insurance and health care (19%), and data information sharing (16%) were the most common types of recommendations that respondents had to help hospitals ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate settings. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 24 QUESTION 3. HOW ARE YOUR PATIENTS '/CLIENTS ' CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS IMPACTING THEIR ACCESS TO NEEDED HEALTH CARE ? (N=59) Participants were asked about their patients'/clients' concerns on their immigration status and how it impacts their access to needed health care. Thirty -six percent responded that their patients'/clients' are significantly impacted by immigrations status. Of those that responded, 70% believe that their patients'/clients' are reluctant to apply for medical coverage. QUESTIO N 4.

Given federal policies and budget cuts that are under consideration, participants were asked the greatest challenge that they foresee in their community's ability to address social determinants of health. This question was asked in an open- ended format; the table below represents the major categories that participants referred to. The majority of respondents commented on the financial burden with accessing health care, housing, insurance, food, and overall lack of resources. Figure 1.

Vista Hill SmartCare (n=2) 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 29 NEXT STEPS The results of the community survey s will guide individual hospital programs and plans, and will also help refine the CHNA process for 2019. Hospital and healthcare systems that participated in the HASD&IC 2016 CHNA process have varying requirements for next steps. Private, not -for-profit (tax exempt) hospitals and healthcare systems are required to develop hospital or healthcare system community health needs assessment reports and implementation strategy plans to address selected identified health needs. The participating public hospitals and healthcare systems do not have federal or state CHNA requirements, but work very closely with their patient communities to address health needs by providing programs, resources, and opportunities for collaboration with partners. Every participating hospital and healthcare system review s the CHNA data and findings in accordance with their own patient communities and principal functions, and evaluates opportunities for next steps to address the top identified health needs in their respective patient communities. The CHNA report is made available as a resource to the broader community and may serve as a useful resource to both residents and healthcare providers to further communitywide health improvement efforts. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 30 SCRIPPS HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION PLAN With the 2016 CHNA complete and health priority areas identified, Scripps Health has developed a corresponding Implementation Strategy - a multifaceted, multi -stakeholder, plan that addresses the community health needs identified in the CHNA. The Implementation Plan translates the research and analysis presented in the Assessment into actual, measurable strategies and objectives that can be carried out to improve community health outcomes. Scripps Health anticipates the implementation strategies may evolve due to the fast pace at which community and health care industry change. Therefore, a flexible approach is best suited for the development of its response to the Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). On an annual basis Scripps Health evaluates the implementation strategy and its resources and interventions; and makes adjustments as ne eded to achieve its stated goals and outcome measures as well as to adapt to changes and resources available. Scripps describes any challenges encountered to achieve the outcomes and makes modifications as needed. In addition, Scripps Health Implementation Plan is filed with the Internal Revenue Service using Form 990 Schedule H on an annual basis. In response to identified unmet health needs in the 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment, during FY17- FY19 Scripps Health is focusing on the strategies and initiatives, their measures of implementation and the metrics used to evaluate their effectiveness. Scripps will monitor and evaluate the strategies listed in the Implementation Plan for the purpose of tracking the implementation of those strategies as well as the document the anticipated impact. Plans to monitor will be tailored to each strategy and will include the collection and documentation of tracking measures. The complete FY17 -FY19 Implementation Plan Report is available online at Scripps.org. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 31 Uncompensated Care UNCOMPENSATED HEALTH CARE Scripps contributes significant resources to provide low and no-cost health care for our patients in need. During FY18, Scripps contributed $358,318,252 in uncompensated health care, including $20,245,366 in charity care, $331,743,910 in Medi - Cal and Medicare shortfall, and $6,328,976 in bad debt . Scripps provides hospital services for one-quarter of the county's uninsured patients. Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego and Scripps Mercy Hospital, Chula Vista provide 64 percent of Scripps' charity care (refer to figure 3:3). The health care safety net in San Diego County is highly dependent upon hospitals and community health clinics to care for uninsured and medically underserved communities. Finding more effective ways to coordinate and enhance the safety net is a critical policy challenge. While public subsidies help finance services for San Diego County's uninsured populations, these subsidies do not cover the full cost of care. Combined with Medi -Cal and Medicare funding shortfalls, Scripps and other local hospitals absorb the cost of caring for uninsured patients in their operating budgets. This places a significant financial burden on hospitals and physicians.

Population size, change in population, race and ethnicity, and age of a population are all important in understanding communities and its residents. San Diego is the second most populous county in California and fifth most populous in the United States. San Diego has: Close to 3.3 million residents Majority minority population Busiest land border crossing in the world - 1 of every 13 people who enter the US come through San Ysidro 70 miles of c oastline 16 naval and military installations 18 federally qualified recognized Indian reservations A total of 4,526 square miles, larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined P opulation: Over three million people (3, 337,685) live in the 4, 526 square mile area of San Diego County (SDC) according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2009- 13, 5- year estimates. The population density for this area, estimated at 746 persons per square mile, is greater than the national average population density of 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 34 approximately 88 persons per square mile. Approximately 96.7% of the population lives in an urban area compared to just 3.3% living in rural areas . P opulation Change: According to the U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census, between 2000 and 2010 the population in S an Diego County (SDC) grew by 281,480 persons, a change of 10.0%. This is similar to the percentage population change seen during the same time period in California (10.0%) and the United States (9.7%). A significant shift in total population over time impacts the demand for health care providers and the utilization of community resources. Race/Ethnicity: In the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2009- 2013, data for race and ethnicity are collected separately. Of those who identified as non-Hispanic (67.7%) in SDC, the majority identified their race as White (70.9%), followed by Asian (16.1%), Black (7.1%), Multiple Races (4.5%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (0.6%), and American Indian/Alaskan Native (0.5%). Of those who identified as Hispanic or Latino (32.4%) in SDC, the majority also identified their race as White (72.4%), followed by other (19.9%), Multiple Races (5.1%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (1.1%), Black (0.6%), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (0.1%). SAN DIEGO'S UNINSURED The lack of health insurance is a significant barrier to accessing needed health care and to maintaining financial security. Between 2010 and 2013 uninsured rate was relatively stable in the United States, California and in San Diego County. In the past, gaps in the public insurance system and lack of access to affordable private coverage left millions without health insurance, and the number of uninsured Americans grew over time, particularly during economic downturns. By 2013, the year before the major coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) went into effect, more than 44 million nonelderly individuals lacked coverage. 5 Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), millions of Californians have gained health coverage. These gains have come either through the expansion of Medicaid (called Medi -Cal in California) to low income adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty guideline (FPG), or through Covered California, the state's ACA health insurance marketplace, where people earning up to 400% FPG can purchase subsidized insurance coverage. The major coverage expansions of the ACA were implemented starting in 2014, and by 2016 the uninured rate among nonelderly 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 35 5 Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of the 2013 National Health Interview Californians had fallen from 15.5% to a historic low of 8.5%. 6 (This percentage includes children). KEY FINDINGS Since 2010, generally all age groups experienced a decline in the percent uninsured for both the county and state. The 18- 64 year age group experienced the greatest decline in number of people uninsured under the ACA. 7 FIGURE 1: PERCENT UNINSURED : UNITED STATES , CALIFORNIA & SAN DIEGO COUNTY , 2012 - 2017 Note: Important to show the uninsured rate for adults 18- 64 as those who are 65+ have Medicare which creates a large impact on the uninured rate in the overall population (reducing the uninsured significantly). 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 36 6 California Health Care Foundation, \"ACA Reduces Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Health Coverage.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ASSISTING LOW-INCOME , UNINSURED PATIENTS The Scripps financial assistance policy is consistent with the language of both State (AB774) California Hospital Fair Pricing legislation and the Internal revenue Code (IRC) 501 (r) Regulations. These practices reflect our commitment to assisting low -income and uninsured patients with discounted hospital charges, charity care and flexible billing and debt collection practices. These programs are available to everyone in need, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, religion or national origin. Scripps makes every effort to identify patients who may benefit from financial assistance as soon as possible and provide counseling and language interpretation. Additionally , Scripps does not apply wage garnishment or liens on primary residences as a way of collecting unpaid hospital bills. Eligibility for financial assistance is based on family income and expenses. For low - income, uninsured patients who earn less than twice the federal poverty level (FPL), Scripps forgives the entire bill. For those patients who earn between two and four times the FPL, a portion of the bill is forgiven. Patients who qualif y for financial assistance are not charged more than Scripps' discounted financial assistance amount. For 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services defined a family of four at 200 percent federal poverty level as $51,500 . 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 37 ESTIMATED ECONOMIC VALUE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROVIDED BY SCRIPPS HEALTH IN FISCAL YEAR 18 Senate Bill 697 Category Programs & Services Included Estimated FY18 Unreimbursed Costs Medical Care Services Charity Care $ 20,245,366 Medi -Cal & Other Government Means Tested Programs (Shortfall) * $ 47,735,604 Medicare & Medicare HMO (Shortfall) ** $ 284,008,306 Bad Debt $ 6,328,976 Total Costs of Uncompensated Care $ 358,318,252 Benefits for Vulnerable Population Definition: Any population that is expose d to medical or financial risk, by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi- Cal, Medicare, California Children's Service Program, or county indigent programs.

Community Health Services COMMUNITY HEALTH SER VICES Community Health Services include prevention and wellness programs, screenings, health education, support groups and health fairs, supported by operational funds, grants, in -kind-donations and philanthropy. Per Section 2 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), behavioral health was identified as the number one health need in San Diego County. Among the other chronic health needs, hypertension was consistently found to be a significant priority area related to cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes was an important factor leading to complications related t o diabetes, and obesity was often found to co- occur with other conditions and contribute to worsening health status. The impact of the top health needs differed among age groups, with Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and anxiety affecting all age groups, drug and alcohol issues affecting teens and adults, and Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension affecting older adults In addition to the health outcome needs that were identified, social determinants of health were a key theme in all of the community engagement activities. Analysis of results from the communi ty partner discussions and key i nformant interviews revealed the most commonly associated social determinants of health for each of the top health needs. Ten social determinants were consistently referenced across the different community engagement activities. The importance of these social determinants was also confirmed by quantitative data. Hospital programs and community collaborations have the potential to impact these social determinants, which are outlined below in order of priority: Food Insecurity & Access to Healthy Food Access to Care or Services Homeless/Housing Issues Physical Activity Education/Knowledge Cultural Competency Transportation Insurance Issues Stigma Poverty 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 47 The programs included in this section raise public awareness and understanding of the community health needs documented in Scripps 2016 Community Needs Assessment Report (Refer to Section 2, Comm unity Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) 15 Included in this section are other health conditions and needs that Scripps addresses via community benefit programs and initiatives. Scripps defines Community Health services according to the Schedule H 990 IRS categories. The categories are broken down into five main areas: (see the Scripps Community Health Services Summary list for more details, page 118). These cost are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part I Lines 7 e, g and i. Community health improvement services Community benefit operations Cash and in- kind contributions Subsidized health services Community building activities During Fiscal Year 2018 (October 2017 to September 2018), Scripps invested $5,334,683 in co mmunity health services (does not include subsidized health). This figure reflects the costs associated with providing these programs, salaries, materials, and supplies minus revenue. Scripps Health strives to improve community health through collaboration with a wide range of partners and like-minded organizations. Working with other health systems, community groups, government agencies, businesses and grassroots movements, Scripps is better able to build upon efforts to achieve broad community health goals and partner with a wide variety of organizations on community health improvement programs.

Reduced access to basic health care services increases illness, injury and mortality and is a major burden on hospitals and health providers, who must provide uncompensated care for the uninsured. More people without insurance translates into higher use of emergency departments, which by law must provide stabilizing care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay. In an effort to provide for people in need, Scripps sponsored a number of programs and activities in FY1 8. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 49 16 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018 MERCY OUTREACH SURGICAL TEAM For three decades, Mercy Outreach Surgical Team (M.O.S.T) has been crossing borders and changing lives. Working in Mexico, the Mercy Outreach Surgical Team provides reconstructive surgeries for children suffering from birth defects or accidents. In special circumstances, surgeries are also provided for adults. During FY18 , the M.O.S.T team served in three outreach mission trips. The M.O.S.T team volunteered 2,243 hours to provide reconstructive surgeries for more than 700 people served. The M.O.S.T program celebrated its 31st anniversary this year. OCTOBER 2017 In October 2017, a team of 52 M.O.S.T. voluntee rs including two plastic surgeons, one urologist, and a general surgeon traveled over 1,500 miles from San Diego to Leon, Mexico. The team helped 164 patients on this mission. A PRIL 2018 With so many patients in need, M.O.S.T. returned for their second mi ssion to Queretaro, Mexico in April 2018. The teams of 58 volunteers included four plastic surgeons, one general surgeon, one urologist, and one ophthalmologist. The team provided 271 children with services. J UNE 2018 In June 2018, M.O.S.T traveled to the coastal city of Ensenada, Mexico at the invitati on of the local Desarrollo Integral de La Familia (DIF), a program that provides assistance to families living in poverty. The weekend mission was focused on corrective eye surgery and ophthalmology. The team performed 58 life changing surgeries and 20 eye exams during the 48 hour trip. SCRIPPS RECUPERATIVE CARE PROGRAM (RCU) The Scripps /San Diego Rescue Mission Recuperative Care Unit (RCU) Project provides a safe discharge for chronically homeless pa tients with ongoing medical needs. All patients are unfunded or underfunded. Most have substance use and/or mental health issues. The lack of funding and mental illness, along with alcohol and/or substance use , make post -acute placement of these homeless patients difficult. RN case management oversight is provided by Scripps with physician back up to ensure completion of their medical recovery goals. Scripps pays the Rescue Mission a daily rate for housing and services provided to the patient. The Rescue Mission provides a safe, secure environment with 24 hour supervision, medication oversight, meals, clothing, and counseling assistance with county medical 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 50 services, Medi -Cal and disability applicati ons, plus help find permanent or transitional housing. Patient transportation needs are coordinated and provided by both the Rescue Mission and Scripps. To maintain the patient's medical stability, medications, DME and other services are provided by Scripps until insurance funding has been established. Patients with psychiatric disorder are connected with a psychiatrist in the community and all patients are connected with a medical home in the community. In FY 18, 54 patients accounted for 65 RCU admissions. As a group, the RCU patients has a cumulative 646 hospital days of stay , an average of 10 hospital days of stay, before going to the R CU. The RCU has taken medically complex patients, including those with: IV antibiotics, wound vacs, skin grafts, fractures, abscesses, osteomyelitis, amputation, paraplegia, dog bites, DKA, G bleeds, pancreatitis, ESRD on dialysis, end stage liver disease, diabetes, traumatic brain injury or encephalopathy, ostomies, complex trauma, MVA, pedestrian versus auto, cancer (lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, brain mass), HIV/Aids, sepsis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, CHF. Patients were assault victims with gunshot and stab wounds, facial trauma, and surgical post op patients. Many are diabeti c and psych problems are common, occasionally the main problem for RCU clients. Over 70% of this group were either positive for alcohol, drugs or had a drug history addressed by the physician in the H & P. More specifically, 43 % of RCU clients were noted to have used heroin or meth. GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION STAFF SUPPORT , ST. LEO'S CLINIC The Graduate Medical Education (GME) program at Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Clinic focuses on physician training and clinical research, with 45+ residents and 38 fellows. Weekly community clinics were held at the St. Leo's clinic. Staffed by Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Clinic internal medicine residents, these clinics cared for approximately 800 of our county's most vulner able residents during FY 18. FIJI SOLOMON ISLANDS MEDICAL MISSION The medical mission consists of Scripps Health general medical specialists and residents setting up clinics on rural islands for the purpose of providing much needed medical care, medical supplies and surgical screening for an underserved population that have no access to basic medical care. The International Medical Missions provide an exceptional clinical education experience to our senior Internal Medicine residents at Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green Hospital. AMERICAN RED CROSS BLOOD DRIVES Scripps Health partnered with the American Red Cross in FY18 to host 13 blood drives ; 421 Scripps employees donated blood throughout the year. Scripps Health collected 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 51 365 pints of blood (for every pint donated 3 lives are saved) , which saved approximately 1,095 lives. SCRIPPS HEALTH HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK RESPONSE Scripps Health builds awareness of disaster preparedness and actively responds to events to affect change at the community level. Following the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, Scripps developed a system -wide disaster preparedness program and moved quickly to make disaster preparedness an integral element throughout the organization's operations. The Scripps Medical Response Team (SMRT) arose from these efforts. In 2017, when San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer asked Scripps to help address the Hepatitis A outbreak, the Scripps SMRT team worked directly with city and county public health officials to make vaccinations accessible to individuals at risk. SMRT teams including physicians, nurses and support personnel administered vaccinations and provided education on Hepatitis A at three county -sponsored housing sites over multiple dates and times. Each site housed numerous occupants, many of whom had risk factors including homelessness or substance use recovery. Occupants were notified in advance that we would be offering vaccinations without cost. For their own protection, a ll volunteers were required to show proof of immunity to Hepatitis A or get vaccinated prior to the outreach. SMRT volunteers vaccinated approximately 100 people against Hepatitis A; Scripps staff then entered their vaccination history into the S an Diego Immunization Program webpage to track all individuals who received the vaccine. This helped prevent unnecessary revaccination of people who came to local emergency departments and primary care offices for care. Because the risk factors associated with the outbreak persist in our community, Scripps employee health screens and offers Hepatitis A vaccinations to all employees considered at risk, especially those who work in the emergency department, behavi oral health and food service. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 52 SCRIPPS HEALTH COMMUNITY BENEFIT (CB) FUND In FY18, Scripps Health continued to deepen its commitment to philanthropy with its Community Benefit Fund. Over the course of the year, it awarded $ 221,000 in community grants to programs in San Diego (four grants ranging from $10,000 to $120,000). The funded projects address some of San Diego County's high priority health needs, seeking to improve access to vital health care services for at risk populations , including the homeless, economically disadvantaged, mentally ill and others. Since the Community Benefit Fund began, Scripps has awarded $ 3.7 million. Programs funded during FY18 include: CONSUMER CENTER FOR HEALTH EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY (CCHEA) Funding provides low income, uninsured Mercy Clinic and Behavioral Health patients help obtaining health care benefits, SSI and related services, while reducing uncompensated care expenses at Mercy. The project provides advocacy services for time intensive governm ent benefit cases . The Consumer Center stresses the importance of accessing community -based services for routine health care instead of using the ED's and hospital departments. They also emphasize the importance of establishing medical homes. CATHOLIC CHAR ITIES Funding provides short term emergency shelter for medically fragile homeless patients upon discharge from Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego and Chula Vista. Case management and shelter are provided for homeless patients discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital. While these patients no longer require hospital care, they do need a short term recuperative environment. Patients who demonstrate a willingness to change receive one week in a hotel, along with food and bus fare to pursue a case plan. The focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent sources of income, housing and other self -reliance measures. The partnership seeks to reduce emergency room recidivism in this population and improve their quality of life. 2-1-1 HEALTH CARE NAVIGATION PROGRAM Locally, 2- 1-1 San Diego was launched in June 2005 as a multilingual and confidential service committed to providing 24/7 access. There was an overwhelming need for a dependable service to help people navigate today's complex health care system. Scripps He alth has been a longtime supporter of 2- 1-1 San Diego's Health Navigation Program which creates a record for every person who calls, in order to provide a service that navigates clients through different referrals and tracks their success toward 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 53 achieving improved social determinants of health. All 2- 1-1 staff are trained to identify individuals who are in need of care coordination services, particularly individuals who are having difficulties managing their chronic health conditions. Health Navigators are trained to determine client risk using the Risk Rating Scale (RRS). The RRS determines a client's status ranging from \"In Crisis\" to \"Thriving\" using social determinants of health such as Housing, Nutrition, Primary Care and Health Management. Health Navig ators assess on the following to determine whether a client has decreased in vulnerability for health management: Understanding of prescription medication: Does the client understand how and when to take their medicine and do they understand the use/import ance of each medication? Health Condition Management: Does the client understand the illness/disease that they have been diagnosed with, what their prognosis is, and what they need to do in order to remain healthy? Health Insurance/ Medical Home: Does the client have health insurance and do they know how to utilize it? Does the client have a primary care doctor and/or specialists that they see and do they know how to make appointments with each? Does the client know in what situation they should make an appointment with the PCP vs going to an Emergency Room for an immediate medical need? Transportation: Does the client have the means to get to their doctor's appointments? During this grant period 2- 1-1 provided care coordination services to 576 clients with complex chronic conditions. Clients decreased vulnerability in the following social determinants of health: housing, nutrition, primary care, and health management by 67%.

Cancer is caused by external factors such as environmental conditions, radiation, infectious organisms, poor diet and lack of exercise, and tobacco use, as well as internal factors such as genetic mutati ons, and hormones. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Cancer causes one out of every four deaths in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, cancer survival is more likely to be successful if the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. Such diagnosis is an indication of screening and early detection. Regular screening that allow for the early detection and removal of precancerous growths are known to reduce mortality for cancers of the cervix, colon and rect um. Five year relative survival rates for common cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon and rectum, cervix, and melanoma of the skin, are 93 percent to 100 percent if they are discovered before having spread beyond the organ where the cancer began. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of cancer is described below: The HASD&IC 2016 CHNA continued to identify Alzheimer's disease as one of the top 15 priority health conditions among S an Diego County hospitals . In 2016 , cancer was the leading cause of death in San Diego County, responsible for 24. 1 percent of deaths. In 2016, t here were 5,096 deaths due to cancer (all sites) 17, and an age adjusted death rate of 146.6 deaths per 100,000 population.18 In 2016, 19.3 percent of all cancer deaths in San Diego County were due to lung cancer, 9.3 percent to colorectal cancer, 7.4 percent to female breast cancer, 7.2 percent to pancreatic cancer, 6.7 percent to prostate cancer, 5.7 percent to liver and female reproductive cancers, and 3.6 percent to Leukemia . According to the American Cancer Society (ACS) 2017 California Cancer Facts & Figures report, in 2014 there were 13,625 observed new cancer cases and 4,868 cancer deaths in S an Diego County . 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 55 17The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statist ics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in S DC in 2016. Causes ar e ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all rankable causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile.\" (Pe\u00f1a, M., County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2016. National Vital Statistics Reports; vol. 67 no 6. Hyattsville, Maryland: National Center for Health Statistics. 2018.) 18 County of San Diego HHSA, Public Health Services, Community Epidemiology Branch According to the ACS Cancer Statistics Center, in 2018 there will be an estimated 29,360 new cases of breast cancer and 4,500 breast cancer deaths for females in California. In 2016, the age- adjusted mortality rate of breast cancer in San Diego County was 20.0 per 100,000 women. This falls slightly below the HP2020 target of 20.7 breast cancer deaths per 100,000 women. According to the 2015 Susan G. Komen for the Cure\u00ae San Diego Affiliate Community Profile Report, in SDC there were 46.1 late- stage case s of breast cancer per 100,000 women, exceeding the HP2020 target of 42.4 cases per 100,000 women. The report projects that SDC will meet the HP2020 target within five years. The 2015 Susan G. Komen for the Cure\u00ae San Diego Affiliate Community Profile also reported that, in 2013, breast cancer mortality rates in SDC were highest among African American women, at 27.7 deaths per 100,000. This exceeded the mortality rate for Caucasian (23.9), Latina (17.3) and Asian/Pacific Islander (13.2). According to the ACS 2017 California Cancer Facts & Figures report, 72.4 percent of breast cancer cases among non- Hispanic white women in S an Diego County were diagnosed at an early stage, compared to 69.3 percent of African American cases, 68.1 percent of Hispanic cases and 70.4 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander cases. Data suggests that early breast cancer detection resources are needed in minority communities. According to 2015- 2016 CHIS data, 85.6 percent of women in S an Diego County between the ages of 50 to 74 reported h aving a mammogram in the past two years. This exceeds the HP2020 target of 81.1 percent for breast cancer screenings. Approximately 2.9 percent of women in this age range in SDC reported that they had never had a mammogram. According to findings from the A CS 2018 Cancer Facts & Figures report, screening offers the ability for secondary prevention by detecting cancer early. For example, the 39 percent decrease in the female breast cancer death rate between 1989 and 2015 is attributed to improvements in early detection, namely screening and increased awareness. In addition, over the past three decades, five-year relative survival rates for all cancers combined increased by 20 percent among whites and 24 percent among blacks, reflecting earlier diagnosis for so me cancers as well as improvements in treatment (ACS, 2018). Study findings from the 2015 Susan G. Komen for the Cure\u00ae San Diego Affiliate Community Profile indicate a critical need for culturally competent outreach, 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 56 especially for Hispanic, Middle Eastern and African American women (Susan G. Komen, 2015). A recent study by the ACS found that 42 percent of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the U.S. are potentially avoidable. Many of the known causes o f the cancer \u2014 and other non- communicable diseases \u2014 are attributable to behavioral factors including tobacco use and excess body weight due to poor dietary habits and lack of physical activity (ACS, 2018). The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) emphasizes the importance of patient navigators as part of a multidisciplinary oncology team with the goal of reducing mortality among underserved patients. A patient navigator may assist with various tasks, including: psychosocial support; assistance with treatment decisions; assistance with insurance issues; arrangement of transportation; coordination of additional services (i.e., fertility preservation); and tracking of interventions and outcomes. The navigator works with the patient across the care continuum, ensuring coordination and efficiency of care, and removal of barriers to care (ASCO, 2016). According to the NIH, clinical trials, a part of clinical research, are at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease by determining the safety and efficacy of a new test or treatment. Greater clinical trial enrollment benefits medical research and increases the health of future generations as well as improves disease outcomes, quality of life and health of trial participants. Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs to educate people about the importance of early detection and treatment for some of the most common forms of cancer. At Scripps, cancer care is more than just medical treatment, and a wide array of resources are provided such as counseling, support groups, complementary therapies and educational workshops. Here are a few examples of Scripps cancer programs during FY 18: SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER DIRECTORY OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES Scripps collaborates with the community and develops a cancer directory of a comprehensive list of resources available for cancer survivors, thei r families, and the community.

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 'Diseases of the heart' were the second leading cause of death in San Diego County in 2016. In addition 'cerebrovascular diseases' were the fourth leading cause of death, and essential (hypertension and hypertensive renal disease' was the tenth. Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of heart disease. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to CVD and stroke. About half of Americans (49%) have at least one of these thr ee risk factors. RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE : Behaviors: Tobacco use, obesity, poor diet that is high in saturated fats, and excessive alcohol use. Conditions: High cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Heredity: Genetic factors likely play a role in heart disease and can increase risk. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of cardiovascular disease is described below: The Scripps 2016 CHNA continued to identify cardiovascular disease (including cerebrovascular disease/stroke) as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. According to data presented in the Scripps 2016 CHNA, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to cardiovascular disease and stroke. About half of all Americans (47 percent) have at least one of these three risk factors. Additional risk factors include alcohol use, obesit y, physical inactivity, poor diet, diabetes and genetic factors (CDC, 2015). Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most racial/ethnic groups in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics and Whites. The World Health Organization defines cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels that include: Coronary heart disease Cerebrovascular disease Peripheral arterial disease Rheumatic heart dis ease Congenital heart disease Deep vein thrombosis Pulmonary embolism Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of heart disease and the leading cause of death in the U.S. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are all risk factors that c ould lead to CVD and stroke. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 61 In 2016, cerebrovascular diseases including stroke were the fourth leading cause of death for San D iego County overall. In 2016, there were 1,362 deaths due to stroke in San Diego County19, a 17.2 percent increase from 2015. The age- adjusted death rate due to stroke was 38.3 per 100,000 population, which was higher than the HP2020 target of 34.8 deaths per 100,000. In 2016, there were 6,346 hospitalizations for stroke in San Diego County, with an age- adjusted rate of 183 per 100,000 population. The rate of hospitalization for stroke increased 2.8 percent from 2015 to 2016 \u2014 the first increase since 2011, when S an Diego County recorded a stroke rate of 218.4 per 100,000 population. In 2016, there were 2,371 stroke -related ED visits in San Diego County . The age- adjusted rate of ED visits was 68.9 per 100,000 population. According to 2016- 2017 CHIS data, an estimat ed 23.9 percent of adults in San Diego County were obese, 9.7 percent smoked cigarettes and 62.0 percent did not regularly walk for transportation, fun, or exercise. In 2016, 16.3 percent of adults in SDC reported eating fast food four or more times in the past week. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) reports that 25 percent of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within five years (NINDS, 2016). The CDC estimates that up to 80 percent o f strokes are preventable through the recognition of early signs/symptoms and the elimination of stroke risk factors. According to the CDC, healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent stroke. Behaviors that can mitigate the risk of stroke include choosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate- intensity aerobic physical activity each week, refraining from or quitting smok ing, and limiting alcohol intake (CDC, 2018). Not only is Scripps a nationally recognized heart care leader, consistently ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's Best Hospitals for cardiology and heart surgery, but we treat more heart pati ents than any other health care provider in San Diego. We have state- of-the-art technology and highly trained heart care specialists, providing an innovative and expansive scope of services and high- quality outcomes. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 62 19The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed i n SDC in 2016. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all ranked causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile.\" (Pe\u00f1a, M., County of San Diego HHSA Publ ic Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2016.

EDUCATING WOMEN ABOUT HEART HEALTH Together with Women Heart National Hospital Alliance, Scripps Cardiovascular developed a women and heart disease education program. The efforts educate women on the importance of heart health, provide support groups and advocate for research funding and policies. SENIOR HEALTH CHATS A wide variety of senior chats are offered at local senior centers in South Bay to address education and prevention of heart disease. Some topics include heart health 101, stroke, and a variety of prevention education. A total of 10 presentations are given yearly to more than 223 individuals. THE ERIC PAREDES SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION Each year, 7,000 teens lose their lives due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). SCA is not a heart attack, it is caused by an abnormality in the heart's electrical system that can easily be detected with a simple EKG. Unfortunately, heart screenings are not part of a regular, well -child exam or pre- participation sports physical. The first symptom of SCA could be death. San Diego alone loses three to five teens from SCA annually . 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 65 Scripps efforts began when a registered nurse at Scripps created the foundation af ter her 15 year old son, Eric passed away from sudden cardiac arrest in 2009. Turning tragedy into an opportunity, the Paredes ' established the organization to prevent sudden cardiac arrest in school -age children and adolescents. As a sponsor for the Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation, Scripps has held more than 20,000 free cardiac screenings to local teens, including the homeless, uninsured and underinsured. In FY18, Scripps made an $8,500 donation to help pay for screenings. In FY 18, Scripps supported screening events at area high schools and screened 4,915 teens, identifying 42 with abnormalities and 24 who were at risk. SWEETWATER UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT - SPORTS SCREENINGS Every year, three to five student athletes in San Diego County die suddenly and unexpectedly from Sudden Cardiac Arrest/Death (SCA/D). SCA is an abnormality in the heart's electrical system that can happen without symptoms or warning signs. However, this life -threatening condition can be detected with a cardiac screening exam. Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Family Medicine Residency, Southwest Sports Wellness Foundation and the Sweetwater Union High School District partner to prevent sudden cardiac arrest and death among high school students by increasing awareness of the importance of healthy lifestyles and cardiovascular screenings among active students. Family Medicine residents offer yearly cardiac screening and sports physicals before students participate in organized sports, and implement an injury cli nic during football season to evaluate and treat possible concussions and other injuries. SU VIDA, SU CORAZON / YOUR LIFE, YOUR HEART COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS OF HEART DISEASE Heart disease is one of the most widespread and costly health problems facing our nation, even though it's also one of the most preventable. Heart failure and stroke account for more than $500 billion in health care costs per year. Heart failure is a progressive disease, primarily caused by high bloo d pressure, high cholesterol/lipids and damage to the heart muscle from coronary artery disease. Scripps Health offers a three week educational based community intervention program to support improved quality of life for patients diagnosed with heart disease. Tobacco use, alcohol abuse, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, stress and depression are some of the major contributing factors leading to heart disease, heart failure and readmission. Recent literature suggest s that post discharge , social support and education are important to prevent readmission. Group sessions provide education and social support. Discharge planning that uses transitional coaches has been proven to 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 66 reduce readmission rates. The overall goal of Your Life, Your Heart is to decrease the readmission rates for heart failure patients, which reduces medical costs for the patient and improves their quality of life. A total of 33 community members have participated in this educational series for those affected by hypertension, angina, cardiac heart failure or any other heart health concerns. Topics covered include the risk of heart disease, signs of heart att ack, diabetes, cholesterol, physical activity, healthy eating and much more. Health assessments are reviewed including waist circumference, weight, height, BMI and blood pressure. Overall, participants have made a positive impact from the course. 2018 BE THERE SAN DIEGO PREVENTING HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES SUMMIT Be There San Diego is an unprecedented, nationally -recognized collaboration and community -wide activation focused on preventing heart attacks and strokes in the San Diego region. Scripps sponsored the 2018 Summit as it is a unique opportunity to bring together physicians, community leaders, healthcare systems, and community partners to impact the region's health by sharing best practices and discussing strategies for future progress . 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 67 DIABETES Diabetes is an important health need because of its prevalence, its impact on morbidity and mortality, and its preventability. An analysis of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 20 16 'Diabetes mellitus' was the seventh leading cause of death. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of diabetes is described below: The Scripps 2016 CHNA continued to identify diabetes as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify diabetes as the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., as well as the leading cause of kidney failure, non- traumatic lower -limb amputations and new cases of blindness among adults. The number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than tripled in the last 20 years (CDC, 2017). In 2016, there were 734 deaths due to diabetes in San Diego County overall 20, a 3.7 percent increase when compar ed to 2015 (708 deaths). The age -adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 20.7 per 100,000 population. In 2016, there were 4,132 hospitalizations due to diabetes in San Diego County. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalization was 120.9 per 100,000 population in 2016, which was slightly lower than the age- adjusted rate in 2015 (123.1 per 100,000 population). In 2016, there were 5,168 diabetes -related ED discharges in SDC, an 8 percent increase from 20 15 (4,783 ED discharges). The age- adjusted rate of diabetes Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin- dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is the body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, the body either resists the effects of insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 68 20 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 2016. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all rankable causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile.\" (Pe\u00f1a, M., County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2016.

Hyattsville, Maryland: National Center for Health Statistics. 2018.) related ED discharges was 151.9 per 100,000 population in 2016, which was higher than the age- adjusted rate in 2015 (143.5 per 100,000 population). According to 2016- 2017 CHIS data, 8.6 percent of adults living in San Diego County indicated that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, which was lower than the state of California (9.9 percent). Diabetes rates among seniors were particularly high, with 18.8 percent of San Diego County adults over 65 reporting that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes. According to 2016- 2017 CHIS data, 12.3 percent of San Diego County residents had been told by their doctor that they have pre- or borderline diabetes. According to the CDC's 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report, 87.5 percent of adults diagnosed with diabetes were overweight or obese. To prevent or delay the onset of diabetes, the CDC recommends lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating healthier, and getting regular physical activity. The CDC estimates that 30.3 million people in the U. S. have diabetes. Of those individuals, 1 in 4 is not aware they have the disease (CDC National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2017). The percentage of adults aged 20 and older who have ever been diagnosed with diabetes was 9.4 % in 201 7 in San Diego County and has been steadily rising since 2005 according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervention because hospitalizations due to diabetes related complications are potentially preventable with proper management and a healthy lifestyle. There are three major types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2 and gestational. All three types share similar characteristics, the body loses the ability to either make or use i nsulin. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood, creating dangerous blood sugar levels. Over time, this buildup damages kidneys, heart, nerves, eyes and other organs. Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is your body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin, a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. Clinical symptoms can include: frequent urination, excessive thir st, extreme hunger, sudden vision changes, unexplained weight loss, extreme fatigue, sores that are slow to heal, and increased number of infections. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 69 Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions, and people of Hispanic origin have dramatically higher rates of the disease and the complications that go along with its poor management, including cardiovascular disease, eye disease and limb amputation. In fact, it is estimated that one out of every two Hispanic children born in 2000 will develop diabetes in adulthood. This is especially true in the South Bay communities in San Diego. Specifically, the city of Chula Vista is home to 26,000 Latinos with diagnosed diabetes and tens of thousands more who are undiagnosed, have pre- diabetes and are at high risk o f developing diabetes. Some alarming facts about Type 2 diabetes: Diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke, and is the 7 th leading cause of death in the United States and California. More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15 to 30% o f those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. Nine out of 10 people with prediabetes don't know they have it. Some risk factors for developing diabetes include: Being overweight or obese Having a parent, brother or sister with diab etes. Smoking Having blood pressure measuring 140/90 or higher. Being physically inactive, exercising fewer than three times a week. A history of gestational diabetes If you are 65 years of age or older A study by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Health Policy Research found that 13 million adults in California (46 percent) are estimated to have prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes, while another 2.5 million (9 percent) have already been diagnosed with diabetes (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2016). The complications related to diabetes are serious and can be reduced with preventive practices. Diabetes is a serious community health problem, leading to school and work absenteeism, elevated hospitalization rates, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 70 During Fiscal Year 2018, Scripps sponsored the following diabetes management programs and initiatives: WOLTMAN FAMILY DIABETES CARE AND PREVENTION CENTER IN CHULA VISTA The Woltman Family Diabetes Care and Prevention Center in Chula Vista serves one of San Diego's communities hit hardest by the diabetes epidemic. Nearly 40 percent of patients admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital Chula Vista, and nearly 32 percent of patients in the heart catheterization lab, have diabetes. County statistics tell us that the rates of death, hospitalizations and emergency room visi ts are twice as high in Chula Vista compared to all of San Diego County. With the generous support of philanthropist Richard Woltman, the Center added critical classroom space to meet the high demand for services. The C enter offers a full range of wellness, prevention, diabetes education and nutrition services in English and Spanish. PROJECT DULCE Project Dulce is a comprehensive, culturally sensitive diabetes management program for underserved and uninsured people in San Diego County. The program i s team based and incorporates the chronic care model. Project Dulce has been active in communities across San Diego for the past 23 years, providing diabetes care and self -management education. Nurse led teams strive for measurable improvements in their patients' health, nurse educators lead multidisciplinary teams that pr ovide clinical management; and peer educators from each cultural group, known as Promotoras, provide public and patient education for their communities. This innovative program combines st ate of the art clinical diabetes management with proven educational and behavioral interventions. One of the primary components of the program is recruiting peer educators from the community to work directly with patients. These educators reflect the diver se population affected by diabetes and help teach others about changing eating habits, adopting exercise routines and nurturing their wellbeing to manage this chronic disease. In FY18 , Project Dulce provided 5,699 diabetes care, retinal screenings and education visits for low income and underserved individuals throughout San Diego and enrolled 1,067 new Project Dulce patients. MEDICAL ASSISTANT HEALTH COACHING (MAC) FOR DIABETES IN DIVERSE PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS Diabetes affects nearly 30 million individuals in the U.S., and if current trends continue, 1 of 3 adults will have diabetes by 2050. Diabetes self -management education and 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 71 support (DSME) is a cornerstone of effective care that improves clinical control and health outcomes; however, DSME participation is low, particular among underserved populations, and ongoing support is often needed to maintain DSME gains. In 2015, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney D iseases (NIH/NIDDK) granted Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute $2.1 million to fund the MAC Trial, which is studying an innovative team care approach that trains medical assistants (MAs) to provide health coaching in the primary care setting to patients w ith poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes, help them problem solve, and improve their diabetes -related health outcomes. The goals include improving diabetes self -management and clinical outcomes, such as blood glucose levels, cholesterol and blood pressure. Th e study is being conducted in two diverse settings: a Scripps Health primary care practice, and a community health center, Neighborhood Healthcare. DIABETES PREVENTION The UCLA Center for Health Policy and Research recently published data that revealed nearly half of California adults have prediabetes or diabetes. While the Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute has been providing the best care for people with diabetes for decades, the Institute continued with the Scripps Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), which is a yearlong intervention where people with prediabetes meet weekly for 16 weeks, then monthly thereafter. The DPP is an intensive lifestyle behavior change intervention program that has been proven to prevent diabetes in large- scale national studies. The primary objective is to lose 5 to 7% of body weight through healthy eating and physical activity. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has been thoroughly evaluated in NIH sponsored randomized controlled trials, and has been found to decrease the number of new cases of diabetes among those with prediabetes by 58%. Among people over age 60, there was a 71% reduction in new cases. In FY18 , 212 patients attended 78 Scripps DPP orientation sessions. Much of the effort is focused in the South Bay for the Latino population, which is at higher risk of getting diabetes than their white counterparts. DIGITAL DIABETES -ME: AN ADAPTIVE MHEALTH INTERVENTION FOR UNDERSERVED HISPANICS WITH DIABETES Diabetes is a fast -growing epidemic, afflicting 29.1 million Americans and costing more than $245 billion a year, according to the American Diabetes Institute. Hispanics face a higher risk of developing the disease - 13.9 percent compared with 7.6 percent for non- Hispanic whites. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 72 The NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases awarded $2.9 million, the largest NIH award to Scripps Whitt ier Diabetes Institute to date, to study an innovative approach to helping Hispanics with diabetes better manage their disease. Dulce Digital- Me provided patients with tools to help them manage their diabetes day to day and improve their health, including text messaging, wireless blood glucose and medication monitoring, diet and exercise assessments, and personalized feedback and goal-setting. This study w as conducted in collaboration with Neighborhood Healthcare, San Diego State University and the University of California San Diego. The participants received health- related text messages every day for six months and they saw improvements in their blood sugar levels that equaled those resulting from some glucose -lowering medications. The Dulce Digital -Me clinical trial represents the first randomized controlled study to look at the use of text messages to help underserved Hispanics better self -manage their di abetes through glycemic control. The results were published by Diabetes Care in an online pre- print version of the study, which is scheduled to be published in a future issue of the journal. HEALTHY LIVING In 2015, Scripps began Healthy Living classes whi ch are open to anyone interested in learning about the benefits of good nutrition, physical activity, and avoiding tobacco. These behaviors can help to prevent the four chronic diseases (lung disease, cancer, Type 2 diabetes and, cardiovascular disease) that contribute to 50 percent of all the deaths in the US. The three- class series is held at locations throughout the community. One hundred fifty seven people attended Healthy Living classes that were provided throughout the County, again with special atte ntion to the Latino community of the South Bay. SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES INSTITUTE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute professional education teams provide state of the art education and training for people who wish to increase their diabetes management knowledge and skills. With the rise in diabetes related devices, there is a great need to equip clinicians with the latest information and clinical skills. The Whittier's professional education program is led by a team o f experts, including: endocri nologists, nurses, dieticians, psychologists and other diabetes specialist. These individuals train practicing professionals to deliver the best possible care for their diabetes patients. Courses are tailored to the needs of allied health professionals seeking to understand new and complex clinical treatment options for Type 1, Ty pe 2 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 73 and gestational diabetes. Professional education was provided for 528 people on insulin management, incretin therapy, and diabetes diet and diabetes basics. Participants came from local health institutions and throughout the United States to learn fro m the Whittier Institute's most experienced diabetes experts. Over the last fiscal year, the Whittier Institute's professional education department provided four CME programs for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, midlevel providers and social workers and made numerous academic and research presentations at professional association meetings. RETINAL SCREENING PROGRAM It is estimated that every 24 hours, 55 people will lose their vision as a result of diabetic - related eye disease ( diabetic retinopathy ) even though 95 percent of diabetic blindness could be prevented with early diagnosis and treatment. For more than a decade, Scripps has been screening people in underserved communities for diabetic retinopathy using a mobile camera. Our free or low -cost eye exams diagnose individuals at high risk for retinal damage and help patients get treatment and referrals to specialists. In FY18 , 534 people were screened, and 33.52 percent had some degree of diabetes -related eye disease. This program referred 31 people who had advanced disease, 5.81 percent of all screened or nearly 17.32 percent of positives , to specialists for further care. HEALTH RELATED BEHAVIORS Health related behavior is one of the most important elements in people's health and well-being. Its importance has grown as sanitation has improved and medicine has advanced. Diseases that were once incurable can now be prevented or successfully treated. Health related behaviors, such as immunization, smoking cessation, improved nutrition, increased physical activity, oral health and injury prevention, have become important components of long term life. The risk factors for many chronic diseases are well known. In particular, an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and substance use have been cited by the World Health Organization ( http://www.who.int/chp ) as important health behaviors that contribute to illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and others including mental disorders and oral diseases. The HASD&IC 2016 CHNA process continued to identify the following among the top priority health conditions in S an Diego County hospitals: diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and stroke, mental health and mental disorders, unintentional injury, high- risk pregnancy, asthma, cancer, back pain, infectious disease and respiratory diseases. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 74 The HASD&IC and Scripps 2016 CHNA community engagement activities emphasized 10 social determinants of health (SDOH) as having a serious impact on the four priority health issues in S an Diego County (cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, behavioral health and obesity). These 10 social determ inants are: food insecurity and access to healthy and poverty. Key informant interviews conduc ted as part of the HASD&IC 2016 CHNA suggested several health improvement strategies to address the four priority health issues identified for S an Diego County . These strategies include: behavioral health prevention and stigma reduction; education on disease management and food insecurity; integrating physical and mental health care; better coordination of care; greater cultural competence and diversity; and engagement of patient navigators and case managers in the community. Fruit/Vegetable Consumption: According to data from California Health Interview Survey, 48.3% of children age 2 and older reported consuming less than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day compared to 47.7% in California overall. Adults age 18 and over reported even less fruit and vegetable consumption. Approximately 70.5% of adults reported eating the recommended amount each day. Unhealthy eating habits are a significant contributing factor to future health issues including obesity and diabetes. Physical Inactivity: According to the CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 14.9% of adults age 20 and older self -reported that they perform no leisure time physical activity. Higher rates of limited leisure time activity were reported at the state and national level (16.6% and 22.6% respectively). For youth results of the FITNESSGRAM physical fitness test show that 29.35% of children in grades 5,7 and 9 ranked within the \"High Risk\" or \"Needs Improvement\" zones for aerobic capacity for the 2013 -2014 year. The percentage of children that are not in the healthy fitness zone varies among ethnic groups with the lowest being non- Hispanic Asians at 20.6% and the highest being Hispanic or Latinos at 42.1%. Although this is smaller than the state average of 3 6.9%, it is still cause for concern and may lead to significant health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and poor cardiovascular health. Alcohol Consumption: The percentage of adults age 18 and ol der who self -report heavy alcohol consumption (defined as more than two drinks per day on average for men and one drink per day on average for women) is 17.2% in San Diego County according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 75 Behavior s such as excessive alcohol consumption are detrimental to future health and may illustrate or preclude significant health issues, such as cirrhosis, cancer, and untreated mental and behavioral health needs. Tobacco Usage: The BFRSS also reports that 12.1% of adults age 18 and older self-reported currently smoking cigarettes some days or every day compare to 18.1% in the United States, adjusted for age. Tobacco use is linked to leading causes of death including cancer and cardiovascular disease. The HHSA's Live Well San Diego (LWSD) 3 -4-50 initiative identified three behaviors (poor diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) that contribute to four chronic conditions (cancer, heart disease/stroke, Type 2 diabetes and pulmonary diseases), which result in more than 50 percent of deaths worldwide. In 2015, 54 percent of all deaths in SDC were attributed to 3- 4-50 conditions. In 2016, 16.3 percent of adults ages 18 and older in SDC self -reported eating at fast-food restaurants four or more times each week (CHIS, 2016). Understanding that personal behaviors play a significant role in an individual's overall health status, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs that help people take charge of their own, and their families,' health. During Fiscal Year 2018, Scripps sponsored a number of health behavior modification efforts: COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AND CLINICAL SERVICES OF SCRIPPS MERCY HOSPITAL CHULA VISTA Community Benefits and Family Medicine Residency Programs have delivered extensive v alue with superior outcomes. Community services combined reached 43,872 (11,400 Scripps Mercy Hospital + 2,000 program participants residency + 30,472 residency clinic visits) program patients and participants. There were more than 30,472 (24,849 residency clinical services + 2523 school based clinic + 3100 other community clinics and residency) clinical visits provided by Scripps Family Medicine Residency . COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES Each month approximately 11,400 community members part icipate in classes, prevention lectures and support groups held at the Well Being Center . Senior focused activities at St. Charles Nutrition Center and Norman Park Senior Center reached over 200 participants . YOUTH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM ACTIVITIES Scripps Chula Vista Community Benefits Services implemented a wide variety of youth in health career activities including: Camp Scripps, mentoring programs, hospital tours, in-classroom presentations and surgery viewings. Scripps Family Medicine Residents 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 76 also provide football game coverage, sport injury clinics and physicals. A total of 3,391 youth participated in these programs. CAMP SCRIPPS Designed to introduce youth to health careers, this program is a three- week camp experience to educate youth participants on the duties performed by health care professionals in various medical fields. Participants receive opportunities for interactions with the health professionals. Camp activities include tours of hospital departments, hands -on activities with health care professionals and presentations on specific health careers and/or health- related issues. Examples of activities include visits to the laboratory, radiology, nursing units and the Cath Lab. Family Medicine residents provide a variety of presentations and interaction activities for the youth. Some of these include \"Doc 101\" or visits to specific hospital departments. MENTORING PROGRAM Designed to help high school students set a course for a successful career in health care, participants are paired with various health and social service professionals for hourly sessions twice a week for five weeks in the hospital setting. Students are exposed to a variety of duties and roles and various departments. Students learn first - hand from their mentors about the particulars of that department and position including the path they need to take in order to achieve a career goal. Students also receive presentations on various health careers and job readiness. Family Medicine residents are mentors for this program and meet with the students each week. Students will shadow residents during rounds and throughout the experience. H EALTH PROFESSIONS OVERVIEW 101 Students from local high schools tour the hospital in departments where patients are not present. Family Med icine residents expose students to the 80 or more health professions in the hospital. These tours are designed to peak student 's interest in pursuing a career in health care. H EALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE CLASSROOM Health care professionals, such as medical residents, dieticians, nurses and doctors, enlighten students on health care careers and health related topics. These are interactive sessions on Nursing 101, Doc 101, Health and Nutrition, Stroke Prevention, Breast Health, Teen Pregnancy, Substance use, STD's, Health Professions 101 and Mental Health Issues that Impact High School Students. Students receive health career tools/brochures that include information on education requirements, scholarships and 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 77 way to pay for college. Family Medicine residents throughout the year will present in the classroom. SURGERY VIEWING Interested students have an opportunity to observe elective surgeries such as total knee and hip r eplacements . Students are able to interact and to ask on the spot questions with the surgeons and other operating room staff members . SCHOOL BASED CLINICS Two health clinics at Palomar and Southwest High School are established for medical residents to gain additional skills in adolescent medicine and for youth to gain the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to pursue health careers. Designed by students, Family Medicine residents and faculty based on youth needs assessme nt surveys, residents and students interact twice per week at the clinic providing adolescent medicine . SENIOR PROGRAMS Each month a variety of senior programs are held in partnership with local senior centers, churches, and senior housing. The following programs are conducted as part of Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista's San Diego Border Area Health Education Center and Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program. These Senior Health Chats are designed to provide health education to the older adult community. Approximately 20- 25 seniors attend these monthly throughout the year. These presentations include a variety of health and age related topics that include nutrition, hearing loss, and maintaining a healthy life style. These presentations are facilitated by various health care professions and residents. Topics are all chosen by the seniors themselves so as to meet their local needs. Also, the health chats provide an interchange between the community members and our medical residents and other health care professionals to foster healthy lifestyles and health prevention. The program are conducted in collaboration with Norman Park Center , Congregational Towers Senior Living and St Charles Nutrition Center . Family Medicine Residents rotate through these progr ams to learn more about geriatric medicine, health and wellness and overall public health and community training. Over 223 seniors participated in these programs. PATIENT COMMUNITY SERVICES Services are offered directly to patients and their family post discharge to decrease the risks of readmission and to increase patient continuity. Support services are referral based and provide assistance with the following: housing/homelessness, senior i ssues, chronic disease issues, drug/alcohol and mental health, cancer and more. This service 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 78 is currently only available at the Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista campus . Since the start of the project in July 2014, 1,539 referrals have been received. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERS (CHIP) AND RESIDENT LEADERSHIP ACADEMY MODEL Scripps is a partner with CHIP and collaboratively works on a resident leadership model that has empowered 700+ citizens across the County (and beyond) to affect change in a wide range of community health areas such as public safety, access to healthy foods, and increased opportunities for physical activity. HEALTH EDUCATION AND SUPPORT GROUPS Education and support groups are provided to San Diego County residents for a wide variety of health concerns. Topics include, macular degeneration, fall prevention, stroke awareness, menopause, sleep disorders, foot health, bladder and pelvic floor wellness, mental illness, postpartum issues, gynecological cancer, and multiple sclerosis . PRESCRIPTION TAKE BACK DAY Prescription drug abuse is a growing problem in the United States. About 54 million people, or more than 20 percent of those aged 12 and older, have used prescription medications such as powerful pain- reducing opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone for non- medical reasons at least once in their lifetime, according to the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Every day, 5,750 more Americans misuse prescription drugs for the first time. And 62 percent of teens who admit taking medications for non- medical reasons say they got those drugs from medicine cabinets in their homes. Scripps encourages patients to remove expired, unwanted and unused medicines from their homes as quickly as possible and to avoid throwing them into the trash or flushing them down the toilet because this unwittingly risks exposing others to the drugs and damages the environment. The semi -annual event offers a no- questions -asked method to safely dispose of such medications, such as the remainder of the 20- day oxycodone supply from that outpatient procedure last year. Flushing drugs down the toilet can harm the environment. Scripps collaborates with the County of S an Diego on the Prescri ption Drug Take Back Day which provides an opportunity for safe disposal of left over medications. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, local law enforcement agencies and county officials host collection events for unwanted prescription drugs at 44 sites across the county. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 79 OPIOID STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM (OSP) The Opioid Stewardship Program has spearheaded multiple projects at Scripps to educate patients and providers about the risks of opioids and the benefits of alternative multi- modal pain management options to reduce opioid use. The program has established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a 25 percent reduction in the number of opioid pills per prescription at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers in 2018. Scripps also has opened thr ee drug take- back kiosks at its on -site pharmacies, offering patients year -round access to dispose of unused, unneeded or outdated medications SPONDYLITIS ASSOCIATION Scripps Health provides meeting space to the Spondylitis Association of America (SAA). This is a non -profit organization founded in 1983 to address t he needs of people affected by S pondyloarthritis. Since that time, SAA has been at the forefront of the fight to promote medical research, educate both the medical community and general public and advocate on behalf of the people they serve. DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE Dementia is a clinical syndrome of decline in memory and other thinking abilities. It is caused by various diseases and conditions that result in damage to brain cells and lead to distinct symptom patterns and distinguishing brain abnormalities. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys a person's memory and ability to learn, reason, make judgements, communicate and carry out daily activiti es such as bathing and eating. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease is described below: The HASD&IC 2016 CHNA continued to identify Alzheimer's disease as one of the top 15 priority health conditions among S an Diego County hospitals . In 2016, Alzheimer's disease was the 6 th leading cause of death in the United States and 3rd leading cause of death in San Diego County. In 2016, the top 10 leading causes of death among adults ages 65 and older in San Diego County were (in rank order): overall cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD), coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, chronic obstr uctive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic lower respiratory diseases, overall hypertensive diseases, diabetes, unintentional injuries, Parkinson's disease and falls. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 80 In 2016, hospitalization rates among seniors were higher than the general population due to CHD, stroke, COPD, nonfatal unintentional injuries (including falls), overall cancer and arthritis. The top three causes of ED utilization among S an Diego County residents ages 65 and older in 2016 were unintentional injuries, falls and arthritis/other rheumatic conditions. Seniors in S an Diego County use the 911 system at higher rates than any other age group. The most common complaints include general medical, altered neurological state, respiratory distress, cardiac chest pain and trauma to the extremities (HHSA, 2015). According to the CDC, 2.8 mil lion older adults, or more than one in four, are treated in the ED for falls every year. One in five falls causes a serious injury, such as broken bones or a head injury, and with each fall, the chance of falling again doubles. These injuries may result in serious mobility issues and difficulty with everyday tasks or living independently. The direct medical costs for fall injuries are estimated at $31 billion annually (CDC, 2018). In 2013, an estimated 62,000 San Diegans ages 55 and older were living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD), which accounted for 8.3 percent of this age group. Assuming current trends continue, by 2030, nearly 94,000 residents 55 years and older will be living with ADOD, which is a 51 percent increase from 2013 (Alz heimer's Disease and Other Dementias in San Diego County, HHSA, 2016). In 2016, an estimated 71.4 percent of S an Diego County residents ages 65 and older reported that they were vaccinated for influenza in the past 12 months (CHIS, 2016). In 2016, 26 of the 46 recorded influenza deaths in S an Diego County occurred among residents ages 65 and older. The age- adjusted rate of influenza death among this group was 6.0 per 100,000 (HHSA, 2016). Research shows that caregiving can have serious physical and mental health consequences. According to findings from the Stress in America survey described in a report titled \" Valuing the Invaluable\" , caregivers to older relatives report poorer health and higher stress levels than the general population. Fifty - five percent o f surveyed caregivers reported feeling overwhelmed by the amount of care their family member needs (AARP Public Policy Institute, updated July 2015). According to AARP, more than 40 million people in the U.S. act as unpaid caregivers to people ages 65 and older. More than 10 million of these caregivers 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 81 are Millennials with separate full - or part -time jobs, and one in three employed Millennial caregivers earns less than $30,000 per year (AARP, 2018). According to a report from the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) and AARP titled Caregiving in the U.S. 2015, 60 percent of unpaid caregivers are female, and nearly 1 in 10 caregivers are ages 75 or older (AARP and NAC, 2015). The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research conducted a study highlighting the plight of California's \"hidden poor,\" finding 772,000 seniors who live in the gap between the FPL and the Elder Economic Security Standard. The highest proportion of seniors living in this gap includes renters, Latinos, women and grandparents raising grandchildren (Padilla- Frausto & Wallace, 2015). During Fiscal Year 2018, Scripps engaged in the following Alzheimer's and dementia prevention and treatment programs and activities: SENIOR HEALTH AND WELL BEING PROGRAMS Senior Health Chats are designed to increase health care information and preventative services for seniors/older adults in the South Bay . Each month a variety of senior programs are held at local senior centers, churches and senior housing. Approximately 20-25 seniors attend these monthly throughout the year, these presentations include a variety of health and age related topics that include nutrition, hearing loss, dementia, Alzheimer's and pain management, nutrition and wellness and maintai ning a healthy life style. These presentations are facilitated by various health care professionals and residents. Topics are all chosen by seniors themselves so as to meet their local needs. Also, the health chats provide an interchange between the community members and the medical residents and other health care professionals to foster healthy lifestyles and health prevention. THE ALZHEIMER 'S PROJECT - SAN DIEGO UNITES FOR A CURE AND CARE The Alzheimer's Project is a countywide initiative aimed at accelerating the search for a cure and helping the estimated 60,000 San Diegans with the disease, along with their caregivers. Participants began meeting in early 2014 to craft a regional roadmap to address the disease, focusing on cure, care, clinical, and public awareness and education initiatives. The Board of Supervisors approved the roadmap in December 2014 and later voted in support of an implementation timetable. Dr. Michael Lobatz from Scripps Health is a leading participant of this initiative as a Co- Chairperson of the Clinical Round Table and is a member of the Steering Committee. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 82 THE SCRIPPS HEALTH ALZHEIMER 'S CARE CONFERENCE The Scripps Health Alzheimer's Care conference took place on February 10, 2018 and was offered to health care professionals who care for the patient with or at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, in order to support them with the best in advanced tools for screening, evaluating, diagnosing and treating . The care conference addressed statistical national local trends in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, focusing on prevalence, mortality, cost and burden to healthcare providers and caregivers. PARKINSON 'S LSVT (LEE SILVERMAN TRAINING ) BIG EXERCI SE: Scripps provides a maintenance class for those who have completed the LSVT BIG Exercise protocol. This class is taught by a physical therapist and is designed for Parkinson's patients to improve strength and mobility for a healthier life. EMPOWERMENT PARKINSON 'S EVENT Scripps offered a conference in 2018 to more than 300 guests where they learned new ways to take control of their health at the Empowerment for Parkinson's Day at Marina Village. Attendees learned the benefits of exercise and diet change, massage, acupuncture, music therapy and were armed with knowledge to help them make positive changes. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 83 OBESITY , WEIGHT STATUS , NUTRITION , ACTIVITY & FITNESS Obesity is an important health need due to its high prevalence in the U.S. and San Diego. Although it is not a leading cause of death, it is a significant contributor to the development of other chronic conditions. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of Obesity, Weight Status, Nutrition and Activity & Fitness is described below: The Scripps 2016 CHNA continued to identify obesity as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. According to 2017 CHIS data, the self - reported obesity rate for adults ages 18 and older in S an Diego County was 22.5 percent. In 2017, between 25 and 30 percent of adults in California self -reported being obese. Obesity levels decreased as education levels increased, indicating a need for heal th education as a tool for reducing obesity rates (CDC, 2017). Obesity has been linked to environmental factors, such as accessibility and affordability of fresh foods, park availability, social cohesion and neighborhood safety (UCLA Center for Health Poli cy Research, 2015). According to data from the 2016 National Study of Children's Health, nearly one-third of children in California are obese. California has one of the highest childhood obesity rates in Western states (The State of Obesity, 2018). Accordi ng to the CDC, some of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. In 2016, 39.8 percent of Americans were obese (CDC, 2017). Obesity is largely categorized as a secondary diagnosis in hospital discharge data. When examining inpatient hospital discharge data with obesity as a secondary diagnosis, it was found that the most common primary diagnosis of those patients were nonspecific chest pain in ages 25- 64, abnormal pain for Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health. Overweight and obesity ranges are determined using weight and heigh t to calculate a number known as \"body mass index\" (BMI). For adults: BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. For children and adolescents (ages 2 -19): BMI at or above the 85th percentile and lower than the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered overweight BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered obese. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUN ITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 85 those ages 15- 24, and those over 65 y ears their primary diagnosis was osteoarthritis, septicemia followed by congestive heart failure. Research has shown that as weight increases to reach the levels of \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" the risks for the following conditions also increases: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancers (endometrial, breast and colon) Hypertension (high blood pressure) Stroke Liver and gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory problems Osteoarthritis Obesity is addressed through general nutrition and exercise education and resources provided at Scripps as well as programs that address a healthy lifestyle as part of care for heart disease, cancer, diabetes and other health issues influenced by healthy w eight and exercise. During FY18, Scripps engaged in the following obesity prevention and treatment activities : COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (CHIP) AND CHILDHOOD OBESITY INITIATIVE The San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative (The Initiative) i s a private public partnership with the mission of reducing and preventing childhood obesity through policy, systems, and environment change. The Initiative is facilitated by Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP). Core funding for The Initiative is provided by the County of San Diego, First 5 Commission of San Diego County, The California Endowment, and Kaiser -Permanente. Scripps is a strong partner with CHIP and the outcomes of The Initiative have shown an overall reduction in childhood overweight and obesity, from 36% in 2005 to 34% in 2015 (many areas have seen increases). According to the 2016 San Diego County State of Childhood Obesity Report, the rate of obesity for Hispanic students is more than twice that of white students. The rate of obesity for economically disadvantaged students is more than twice that of students who are not economically disadvantaged. Hispanic students represent approximately half of all public school students in San Diego County with respect to race/ethnicity, and low-income students account for half of all public school students. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 86 DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP) A large clinical trial concluded that people with prediabetes could reduce their likelihood of developing diabetes by 58- 70 percent if they lost just 5 -7 percent of their body weight. The Diabetes Prevention Program is a scientifically validated lifestyle interv ention based model. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) promote widespread adoption of the DPP due to its demonstrated effectiveness. Scripps is recognized by the Centers for Disease Control as a national DPP provider, and rolled out the program to patients and community members in 2016. Scripps aims to decrease the incidence of Type 2 diabetes by managing a major diabetes risk factor, obesity in the underserved, ethnically diverse populations by testing the ef fectiveness of lifestyle curriculum. The program uses trained lifestyle coaches and a standardized curriculum; participants meet in groups with a coach for 16 weekly sessions and six to eight bimonthly follow -up sessions. Participants must have prediabetes and be overweight to enroll. No physician referral is required, although many physicians do refer their patients to this valuable resource. Orientation sessions are held in Spanish and English throughout the county. HEALTHY LIVING PROGRAM Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and respiratory disease are the four most prevalent serious chronic diseases in California. These diseases cause 50 percent of all deaths in San Diego and throughout the U.S., and many people have more than one of these conditions. Because lifestyle can play a major role in preventing these chronic illnesses, Scripps introduced Healthy Living, a free, interactive education program to help the San Diego community learn about and adopt practical ways to improve three behaviors : smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity that contribute to these four diseases. Participants learn how to make healthy food choices using low costs options, make physical activity part of their daily life and learn how to stay motivated and maintain healthy habits. Scripps implements a series of three free sessions that encourage participants to identify and adopt practical ways to improve their health habits. Sessions are offered throughout San Diego County i n English and Spanish, with special emphasis on the Latino and underserved communities. Sessions include health screening s, healthy cooking tips, and mindful eating practice sessions. Participants also receive a prediabetes screening; those who score high are then referred to the Scripps Diabetes Prevention Program. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 87 PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD INITIATIVE Scripps also addresses childhood obesity at the high school level in San Diego's South Bay communities through its partnership with the Promise Neighborhood initiative, which implements activities related to the national 5210 campaign. The message is to promote a Healthy Lifestyle (5 Servings of Fruits and Vegetables, 2 Hour Screen Time Limit, 1 Hour of Physical Activity and 0 Sugary Drinks) per day. This five session series is designed to increase knowledge and behaviors regarding a healthy lifestyle. The series includes hands -on activities and demonstrations. Scripps partners with the Promise Neighborhood Initiative and Castle Park Elementary School to increase education and awareness about healthy lifestyles for students, their parents and school staff. Promise Neighborhood developed a Wellness Committee composed of the school principal, teachers, parents and Scripps staff aimed to implement activities that support 5-2-1-0: 5 fruits or more a day, 2 hours or less of screen time, 1 hour of physical activity and 0 sugary juices. School administrators and staff are closely involved in the program, which incl udes five educational sessions, a health assessment survey and health plan, and support to help the students pass their yearly physical education requirements. Since 2013, more than 400 children and 200 parents have participated in wellness activities on c ampus. As a result of activities, lesson plans and advocacy for healthy living, the amount of physical activity and consumption of fruits and vegetables by children, parents and staff has increased. Student responses via a 5210 post health assessment surve y showed that there was an 80% improvement rate for knowledge after participating in the 5210 sessions. And a 38% improvement rate for behavior after participating in the 5210 sessions. CITY HEIGHTS WELLNESS CENTER La Maestra Family Clinic, Inc. joined t he City Heights Wellness Center collaborative partnership with Scripps Mercy Hospital and Rady Children's Hospital as the lease holder of the Wellness Center starting September 1, 2016.

There is tremendous focus on maternal illness and death, and infant health and survival, including infant mortality rates, access to preventative care, and fetal, perinatal and other infant deaths. Maternal and infant health issues include: Alcohol, tobacco and illegal substances during pregnancy, which are major risk factors for low birth weight and other poor outcomes. Very low birth weight associated with preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, low pre-pregnancy weight and smoking. Infant death rates are highest among infants born to young teenagers and mothers 44 years and older. Being pregnant, or trying to become pregnant, is only a small portion of a woman's life. Unintended pregnancy, either mistimed or unwanted at the time of conception, accounts for an estimated 49 percent of pregnancies in the U.S. These pregnancies are associated with increased morbidity, as well as behaviors linked to adverse health. Women wh o can plan the number and timing of their children experience improved health, fewer unplanned pregnancies and births, and lower abortion rates. HIGH RISK PREGNANCY High Risk Pregnancy can be the result of a medical condition present before pregnancy or a medical condition that develops during pregnancy for either mom or baby and causes the pregnancy to become high risk. A high risk pregnancy can pose problems before, during or after delivery and might require special monitoring throughout the pregnancy. Risk factors: Advanced maternal age: increased risk for mother's 35 years and older. Lifestyle choices: smoking, alcohol consumption, use of illegal drugs. Medical history: prior high risk pregnancies or deliveries, fetal genetic conditions, family history of genetic conditions. Underlying conditions: diabetes, high blood pressure and epilepsy. Multiple pregnancy. Obesity during pregnancy. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 91 A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of Maternal and Child Health & High Risk Pregnancies are described below: The HASD&IC 2016 CHNA continued to identify high risk pregnancies as one of the top 15 priority health conditions among San Diego County hospitals In 2016, there were 42,654 live births in SDC over all.21 The 2016 fetal mortality rate20 was 3.2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in the north inland region, 3.4 in the north coastal region, 3.7 in the east region and SDC overall, 3.8 in the central region, 3.9 in the north central region, and 4.3 in t he south region. In 2016, 159 infants died before their first birthday in SDC. Infant mortality was higher among male infants (93 deaths) than female infants (66 deaths). African American/black infants had the highest mortality rate (10.7 infant deaths p er 1,000 live births) when compared to infants of all other races and ethnicities. Hispanic infants had the second highest mortality rate of 4.5 deaths per 1,000 live births. In addition, there were 3,628 preterm births (less than 37 weeks gestation) in SD C during 2016. Compared to all other races and ethnicities, Hispanic mothers had the highest total number of births (16,978), 8.2 percent of which were preterm. Despite having fewer total births than Hispanic mothers (1,781), 11.6 percent of births by Afri can American/black mothers were preterm. Similarly, although women ages 25 to 39 had the highest total number of births compared to other age groups, mothers age 40 and above were more likely to give birth preterm compared to younger age groups (45.8 percent preterm births among mothers age 40 and above compared to 15.4 percent preterm births among mothers ages 25 to 39). 22 In 2016, all SDC regions met the HP2020 national targets for prenatal care, preterm births, low birth weight (LBW) infants, very low bi rth weight (VLBW) infants and infant mortality.23 See Table 2 for a summary of maternal and infant health indicators in S an Diego County in 2016 and Table 3 for a summary of maternal and infant health indicators by region. 21 County of San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Maternal, Child, and Family Health 20 Fetal mortality refers to the number of fetuses at least 20 complete weeks of gestation per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths. Reporting of fetal deaths is known to be complete. 22 County of San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Maternal, Child, and Family Health 23 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' HP2020 initiative represents the nation's prevention agenda for the second decade of the 21st century. HP2020 has four overarching goals: to attain high quality, longer lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death; to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups; to create social and physical environments that promote good health for all, and to promote quality of life, healthy development, and healthy behaviors across all life stages. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 92 Table 2 : Maternal and Infant Health Indicators in San Diego County, 2016 Maternal and Infant Health Indicator Rate HP2020 Target San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Maternal, Child, and Family Health Services (MCFHS) Statistics Table 3 : Maternal and Infant Health Indicators by Region in San Diego County, 2016 Indicator Central East North Central North Coastal North Inland South Prenatal Care H ealth Services, MCFHS Statisti cs Scripps Health continued to enhance prenatal education for low income women in San Diego County in Fiscal Year 2018. The following are some examples: COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICES Offered more than 1,200 maternal child health classes throughout San Diego County to enhance parenting skills. Low income women in San Diego who were eligible attended classes at no charge or on a sliding fee schedule. Maintained existing prenatal education services in all regions of the county, ensuring that programs continued to de monstrate a satisfaction rating above 90 percent. Provided and supported weekly breastfeeding support groups at six locations throughout San Diego County, including t hree with bilingual services. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 93 24 Early prenatal care is defined as care beginning during the first trimester of pregnancy. This does not account for frequency of care. 25 Preterm birth refers to births prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation. 26 Very low birth weight refers to birth weight less than 1,500 grams (approximately 3 pounds, 5 ounces). 27 Low birth weight refers to birth weight less than 2,500 grams (approximately 5 pounds, 8 ounces). 28 Infant mortality refers to the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Offered maternal child health classes throughout the community, such as Getting Ready for the Baby and Grand Parenting Today . Offered the Dogs and Babies programs quarterly, with more than 40 attendees. Offered a prenatal yoga program for expectant women in San Diego County. Offered classes in pelvic floor and postpartum changes for new mothers throughout the community. FIRST 5 PARENTING EDUCATION Parenting classes are offered at the Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Well -Being Center for parents with infants, toddlers and preschoolers. A wide variety of topics are covered including issues related to health, learning/development, family/safety, advocacy as well as parenting tips. Developmental assessments are conducted by Rady Children's Hospital. More than 400 services were received for first time mothers including: home visits, referrals received, data entry, follow up phone calls, parenting classes and other support services. A total of 209 parents participated in parenting classes, 180 sessions provided. MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH NURSING STUDENTS Scripps Perinatal Education program supports local nursing students with the opportunity to observe prenatal educational classes. This critical aspect of the nursing education allows the hours and information to meet their clinical rotation requirements in maternal child health. SCRIPPS MERCY 'S SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN , INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) The Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) was established as a permanent program in 1974 to safeguard the health of low -income women, infants and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk. Scripps Mercy Hospital is one of five regional organizations that administer the state funded WIC program. The program serves six locations conveniently situated near community clinics and/or hospitals in the central San Diego area. WIC targets low income pregnant and postpartum women, infants and children (ages 0 to 5 years). Scripps Mercy WIC serves approximately 6,500 women and children annually, 44 percent in the City Heights community. In City Heights clients are 91 percent Hispanic and include pregnant and postpartum women (24%), infants (20%) and children (56%). In FY18 , the program provided nutrition services, counseling and food vouchers for 71,357 women and children in South and C entral San Diego. The Scripps Mercy WIC program plays a key role in 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 94 maternity care by reaching low income women to promote prenatal care, good nutrition and breastfeeding during pregnancy and offer lactation support (one on one and group), as well as supplies, pumps and breast pads, during the postpartum period. CENTERING PREGNANCY , SCRIPPS FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY Raising healthy families and caring for the next generation of San Diegans before they're born help create a healthier community for years to come. The Scripps Family Medicine Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, is providing access, education and clinical services to nearly 200 pregnant women in south San Diego County. The goal of the program, \"Improving Perinatal Care for Underserved Latina Women - Healthy Women, Healthy Babies\", is to provide access to perinatal care for underserved Latina women in order to improve birth outcomes. The program applies the principles of the Center Health Care Institute and focuses on changing the way pat ients experience their care through assessment, education and group support. Centering Pregnancy is the institute's model devoted specifically to improving maternal and child health, and has been shown to result in increased prenatal visits, greater levels of breastfeeding and stronger relationships between mothers and their healthcare providers before, during and after pregnancy. The results are promising. Women who gave birth reported an enhanced prenatal experience, gained less weight throughout their pr egnancy and showed improved healthcare knowledge. As the program continues, patient navigators will follow -up with participants to gauge other important factors and help them maintain healthy lifestyles. UNINTENTIONAL INJURY AND VIOLENCE Unintentional inj uries occur at home, at work, while participating in sports and recreation, on the streets and at school and are associated with motor vehicle accidents, falls, firearms, fire/burns, drowning, poisoning (including drugs and caustic substances), alcohol, gas, cleaners and many other causes. The deaths associated with unintentional injuries are significant, yet represent only a small part of a much larger public health problem. Hospitalization data is a better measure of the injury problem than the death data alone. Unintentional injuries, motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian related, firearms, fire/burns, drowning, explosion, poisoning (including drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and caustic subs tances) choking/suffocation, cut/pierce, exposure to electric current/radiation/fire/smoke, natural disasters and injuries at work, are one of the leading causes of death for S an Diego County residents of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 95 Most events resulting in injury, disability or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors and choices, such as alcohol use or risk taking; the physical environment both at home and in the community; access to health services and systems created for injury related care; the social environment, including individual social experiences. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of unintentional i njury and v iolence is described below: The HASD&IC 2016 CHNA continued to identify unintentional injury as one of the top 15 priority health conditions among S an Diego County hospitals. In 2016, accidents (unintentional injuries) were the fifth leading cause of death for San Di ego County overall. Unintentional injuries (i.e., motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian- related, firearms, fire/burns, drowning, explosions, poisoning (including drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and caustic substances), choking/suffocation, cut /pierce, exposure to electrical current/radiation/ fire/smoke, natural disasters and workplace injuries) are one of the leading causes of death for S an Diego County residents of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. Between 2012 and 2016, more than 5,70 0 San Diegans died from unintentional injuries. In 2016, there were 1,071 deaths due to unintentional injury in San Diego County 29 The County's age-adjusted death rate due to unintentional injury was 31.1 deaths per 100,000 population. In 2016, unintentio nal injury accounted for 5.1 percent of total deaths in San Diego County. In 2016, there were 20,247 hospitalizations related to unintentional injury in San Diego County. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations due to unintentional injury was 589.4 per 100,000 population. In 2016, there were 169,017 ED discharges related to unintentional injury in SDC. The age- adjusted rate of discharges due to unintentional injury was 5,160.3 per 100,000 population. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 96 29 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 2016. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all ranked causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocoli tis due to Clostridium difficile.\" (Pe\u00f1a, M., County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2016. National Vital Statistics Reports; vol. 67 no 6. Hyattsville, Maryland: National Center for Health Statistics. 2018.) CDPH injury data reports that in 2016, unintentional injuries caused over 13,000 deaths, 200,000 non- fatal hospitalizations, and 2.3 million non- fatal E D visits (CDPH, Safe and Active Communities Branch, 2016). In 2015, the CDC recorded approximately 30.8 million ED visits in the U.S. for unintentional injuries (CDC, 2015). In 2015, the CDC recorded approximately 30.8 million ED visits in the U.S. for unintentional injuries (CDC, 2015). In 2016, unintentional injury was the third leading cause of death across all age groups in the U.S., accounting for over 160,000 deaths. Unintentional injury was the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people ages 1 to 44, and the seventh leading cause of death for those over age 65 (CDC, 2018). According to data from NCHS, in 2016, over 130,000 deaths in the U.S. were attributed to three causes: poisoning (26 percent), motor vehicle traffic accidents (16.9 percent), and falls (16.5 percent). Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among children in the U.S., while nonfatal unintentional injuries can result in children having long -term disabilities (LWSD Report Card on Children, Families, and Community, 2017). Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death among children, with many survivors enduring the consequences of brain and spinal cord injuries. The physical, emotional, psychological and learning problems that affect injured children, along with the associated costs, make reducing traumatic injuries a high priority for health and safety advocates throughout the nation. Educational programs like ThinkFirst increase knowledge and awareness of the causes and risk factors of brain and SCI, injury prevent ion measures, and the use of safety habits at an early age (www.thinkfirst.org/kids, 2015). San Diego County has made strides to decrease deaths from unintentional injuries as well as non- fatal unintentional injury rates, though non- fatal unintentional inj ury rates continue to exceed state and federal rates. SDC has focused injury prevention efforts on the most vulnerable populations, including children of all ages (especially older children), Native American and rural children. Successful interventions inc lude safety campaigns, educational strategies and changes in parenting practices (LWSD Report Card on Children, Families, and Community, 2017). According to HP2020, most events resulting in injury, disability or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors and choices, such as alcohol use or risk-taking; physical environment both at home and in the community; access to 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 97 health services and systems for injury -related care; and social environment, including individual social experiences (e.g., social norms, education and victimization history), social relations hips (e.g., parental monitoring and supervision of youth, peer group associations and family interactions), community environment (e.g., cohesion in schools, neighborhoods and communities) and societal factors (e.g., cultural beliefs, attitudes, incentives and disincentives, laws and regulations). Scripps Health continues to address unintentional injury and violence in FY 18. The following are some examples: AGING SUMMIT EXPO Scripps provided a conference on home and medication safety and fall pre vention. This conference was designed to provide seniors with education and resources for healthy living. FALL PREVENTION AND HOME SAFETY Scripps Social Worker and RN lecture on ways to reduce fall risk, improve safety awareness and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. Balance classes are designed to help building balance, posture and coordination through strengthening and balance exercises. This importance aspect to healthy living for seniors provides education on preventing falls through exercise and being proactive through safety measures in the home. SAN DIEGO BRAIN INJURY FOUNDATION Scripps Health provides meeting space to the San Diego Brain Injury Foundation. The organization provides quality of life improvements for brain i njury survivors and support to family members. BRAINMASTERS Brainmasters is a supportive communication group for adults coping with acquired brain injury. It is offered a s a community benefit through the Rehabilitation Center at Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas. The main goal of Brainmasters is to help brain injury survivors to build confidence by practicing thinking on their feet. This helps to alleviate challenges with c ommunication and social isolation that so many brain injury survivors experience. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 98 EVERY 15 MINUTES Alcohol can be attributed to more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S. annually, including 41% of all traffic fatalities. The Every 15 Minutes program i s a two -day immersion experience for teens on the realistic consequences of drinking and driving, which involves the schools, law enforcement, courts, emergency service providers, and the mortuary. The \"injured\" students are taken to Scripps Mercy Trauma Center. This program is sponsored jointly by local high schools, county police and sheriff's departments, ambulance services, and emergency departments. BEACH AREA COMMUNITY COURT PROGRAM The program is an educational program for first time offenders for quality of life crimes. This is a collaboration with the San Diego Police Department, Parks and Recreation, District Attorney's Office and Discover Pacific Beach. Education is provided to the participants regarding these quality of life crimes and their effects on t he community, the effects of smoking and alcohol consumption and the rules and regula tions for the beach community. SAN DIEGO COUNTY LIFEGUARD EDUCATION CONFERENCE In FY18, the trauma department at Scripps La Jolla hosted the first ever San Diego County Lifeguard Education Conference. More than 150 lifeguards representing all 11 San Diego County lifeguard agencies were in attendance at the event. Information was shared on a number of topics critical for lifeguards, including downing resuscitation, sand ent rapment and skin cancer prevention. A physician presented on shark bite attack survival. The trauma department plans to continue this partnership with the county lifeguards to provide education and help them further identify opportunities for community out reach and injury prevention. SAN DIEGO HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE AND PROJECT LIFE Scripps has partnered with the San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force and Project Life to offer \"soft rooms\" at all Scripps hospital facilities except Scripps Green Hospital. These soft rooms will be available to Project Life on a moment's notice to serve as a safe, confidential environment for law enforcement to interview victims of human trafficking and for servi ce providers to connect with the victims with emergency shelter and community resources. The San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force receives 3,000 to 8,000 human trafficking victims every year in San Diego County. Approximately 80 percent are born in the U nited States. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 99 SAVING LIVES THROUGH STOP THE BLEED CAMPAIGN Whether from a bullet wound or other traumatic injury, severe blood loss can kill in just five minutes. Howev er, one- fifth of trauma deaths, the leading cause of death for Americans under ag e 46, could be prevented by stanching the bleeding. Scripps doctors participate and convey the important messages of the national Stop the Bleed campaign . TRAUMA AWARENESS CONFERENCE Scripps participates with local agencies giving attendees the opport unity to le arn more about Trauma Services. Education is provided on injury prevention and the latest trauma research. Activities include: c oncussion prevention, fatal vision goggles, and learning the consequences of distracted driving . 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 100 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Behavioral health is an important health need because it impacts an individual's overall health status and is a comorbidity often associated with multiple chronic conditions, such as diabetes, obesity and asthma. Behavioral health encompasses many different areas including mental health, mental illness and substance use. Because of its broadness, it is often difficult to capture the need for behavioral health services with a single measure. An analysis of mortality data in San Diego County found that in 2016 , Alzheimer's disease and suicide as the third and ninth leading causes of death in San Diego County, respectively . A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of behavioral health is described below: The Scripps 2016 CHNA continued to identify behavioral health as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. The HASD&IC 2016 CHNA identified behavioral health as the top priority health issue for community members in S an Diego County. In the HASD&IC 2016 CHNA mental health issues and alcohol/dr ug abuse issues were consistently selected by the highest number of HHSA survey participants in all regions as health problems that have the greatest impact on overall community health. In addition, aging concerns including Alzheimer's disease was cited am ong the top five most important health needs in all regions in San Diego County except the central region. The following categories were found to be important health needs with behavioral health in San Diego County: Alzheimer's disease (seniors) Anxiety (a ll age groups) Drug and alcohol issues (teens and adults) Mood disorders (all age groups) Mental Health can be defined as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being, and not merely the absence of disease\". Mental illness is defined as \"collectively all diagnosable mental disorders\" or \"heal th conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning\". 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 101 Feedback from the behavioral health discussions in the 2016 CHNA found that high rates of psychotic discharges in ages 25 to 44 were likely linked to underlying substance use problems. Although participants agreed with the findings, it was found that hospi tal coding may potentially underrepresent the prevalence of underlying issues and miss certain conditions. Most notably missing from OSHPD data was developmental disorders. The groups also pointed out the importance of emerging data trends. In recent years , discussion participants cited a significant increase in drug -related discharges, particularly methamphetamine (~over 100%). An analysi s of 2016 mortality data for San Diego County revealed Alzheimer's disease and suicide as the third and ninth leading causes of death for S an Diego County , respectively. Among adults : 14.6 % of Medicare beneficiaries suffer from depression, 10.3% have seriously considered suicide and 12.4% per 100,000 commit suicide each year. In 2016, 5,692 individuals were discharged from the emergency department (ED) for self -inflicted injury in San Diego County , an age -adjusted rate of 173.20 per 100,000 population. This included 191 individuals ages 65 and older, an age-adjusted rate of 44.37 per 100,000 population. Of these seniors, 90 were hospitalized (20.91 per 100,000 population). During the same year, the age- adjusted death rate due to suicide in San Diego County was 11.89 deaths per 100,000 population, or 406 deaths. The rate for seniors was much greater at 18.35 deaths per 100,000 population. Both rates are higher than the HP2020 target of no more than 10.2 deaths per 100,000 population. According to 2017 data from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD), anxiety disorders were the top primary diagnosis f or behavioral health- related ED discharges among those ages five to 44 and ages 65 and older. For those ages 45 to 64, the top ED discharge for behavioral health was alcohol -related disorders, followed by anxiety and mood disorders. According to 2017 CHIS data, 11.8 percent of adults in SDC have ever seriously thought about committing suicide, a 40.5 percent increase since 2013 (8.4 percent). In 2016, there were 1,080 hospitalizations due to overdose/poisoning in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations due to overdose/poisoning was 31.2 per 100,000 population. In 2016, the age- adjusted rate of overdose/poisoning -related ED discharges in SDC was 162.3 per 100,000 population. Age- adjusted rates for 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 102 overdose/poisoning -related ED discharges were higher among males, blacks and individuals ages 15 to 24 years in comparison among groups. In 2014- 2015, 12.3 percent of California adolescents ages 12 to 17 experienced a Major Depressive Episode (MDE). This rate has increased 3.1 percent since 2011- 2012 ( Substance use and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Beha vioral Health Barometer - California Volume 4, 2017). From 2011 to 2015, less than a third of California adolescents ages 12 to 17 who experienced an MDE in the past year received treatment (SAMHSA, Behavioral Health Barometer - California Volume 4, 2017). Approximately 10.2 million U.S. adults have co- occurring mental health and addiction disorders (NAMI, 2016). SUICIDE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS Suicide is a major complication of depression and a leading cause of non- natural death for all ages in San Diego County, second only to motor vehicle accidents. Compared to 2016, the County's suicide rate in 2017 increased 5% from 13.1 to 13.8 per 100,000 population. This increase follows a 5% decrease in r egional suicide rates from 2013 to 2016. In contrast, the rate of regional Emergency Department discharges due to non- fatal self -harm decreased 5% between 2015 and 2016 (most recent data available). In addition, significant gains in help- seeking are evident. Crisis Calls to the local Access & Crisis hotline in 2017 incr eased 22% to an unprecedented 31.4% of all call volume.

Scripps is a member of the Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP), which collaborates with the county on this initiative. The behavioral health program s at Scripps Mercy also supports community programs to reduce the stigma of mental illness and help affected individuals live and work in the community. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INPATIENT PROGRAMS Individuals suffering from acute psychiatric disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to themselves or others. In such cases, hospitalization may be the most appropriate alternative. The Behavioral Health Inpatient Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital helps patients and their loved ones work through short -term crises, manage mental illness and resume their daily lives. Challenges Like many behavioral health programs across the country, funding is difficult, as payment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In FY 18, the Sc ripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program experienced a $4.7 million loss in total operations, however 3.3 million of this is captured in Medi - Cal/CMS and Charity Care. In FY 18, 2.0 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS Scripps Behavioral Health entered into an agreement in May 2016 to transition the intensive behavioral health outpatient program to the Family Health Centers of San Diego and expand outpatient behavioral health offerings to the populati on served. SCRIPPS MERCY AND FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIP Scripps Mercy has established an initiative with Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) to create a more robust behavioral health care system for Medi -Cal patients that receive care at SMH. The goal is to strengthen the continuum of integrated primary and mental health services for patients discharged from various hospital settings (medical and behavioral health in patient and emergency care) through a variety of timely patient engagement strategies including the expansion of community -based behavioral health services adjacent to the hospital. The ultimate goal is to involve 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 104 patients in appropriate outpatient care be fore their behavioral health issues become acute , preventing return s to the Emergency Department. MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACH SERVICES , A-VISIONS VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM Behavioral Health Services at Scripps Mercy Hospital, in partnership with the San Diego chapter of Mental Health of America established the A -Visons Vocational Training Program (social rehabilitation and prevocational services for people living with mental illness) to help decrease the stigma of mental illness and offer volunteer and employm ent opportunities to persons with mental illness. This supportive employment program provides vocational training for people receiving mental health treatment, potentially leading to greater independence. This year, Behavioral Health Services continued par ticipating in the A -Visions program. Since its inception, 577 clients have been enrolled; 96 have been Scripps volunteers and 52 have been employed at Scripps Health. Currently, there are a total of 20 employees and four volunteers participating in this supportive employment program. A - Visions participants have been employed on a casual/per diem basis by Scripps Environmental Services, Food Services and clerical support for Health and Information Services, Emergency Services, Nursing Research, Human Resourc es, Access, Behavioral Health, Credentialing, Labor and Delivery, Laboratory, Medical Staffing, Performance Improvement, Spiritual Care and Palliative Care Services. Paid A -Visions candidates typically limit their work to eight hours per week, which allows them to maintain eligibility for the disability benefits, medications and ongoing behavioral healthcare that supports their work. INCREASING AWARENESS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES In FY 18, Scripps Behavioral Health Services improved awareness of mental health issues by providing information and supportive services for more than 900 people at community events . COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERS (CHIP) AND SUICIDE PREVENTION COUNCIL The San Diego County Suicide Prevention Council (SPC) is a collaborative community - wide effort focused on realizing a vision of zero suicides in San Diego County. Its goal is to prevent suicide and it s devastating cons equences in San Diego County. Since 2010, with support from the County of San Diego Behavioral Health Services, CHIP provides direct oversight and guidance toward the implementation of the Suicide Prevention Action Plan. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 105 The core strategies of the S uicide Prevention Council are: Enhancing collaborations to promote a suicide- free community Conducting needs assessments to identify gaps in suicide prevention services and supports Disseminating vital information on the signs of suicide and effective help-seeking Providing resources to those affected by suicide and suicidal behavior Advancing policies and practices that contribute to the prevention of suicide PSYCHIATRIC LIAISON TEAM (PLT) The Psychiatric Liaison Team is a mobile psychiatric assessment team. Clinicians provide mental health evaluation and triage services to accurately assess patients and provide them with the best and safest community resources to promote ongoing care. The t eam aims to help people adhere to treatment plans, reduce hospital readmission rates, relieve symptoms and ultimately ensure the long -term stabilization of the patient's mental health. Scripps will continue to provide a dedicated Psychiatric Liaison Team a t all Scripps Hospitals Emergency Departments and urgent care settings (Rancho Bernardo and Torrey Pines). MI PUENTE : \"MY BRIDGE \" TO BETTER CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH AND WELL BEING Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute received a $2.4 million study grant from the NIH's National Institute of Nursing Research in 2015 to evaluate Mi Puente, a program at Scripps Mercy Chula Vista hospital that uses a \"nurse + volunteer\" team approach to help hospitalized Hispanic patients with multiple chronic diseases reduce their hospitalizations and improve their day -to-day health and quality of life. Individuals of low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority status, including Hispanics, the largest U.S. ethnic minority group are disproportionately burdened by chronic cardiovasc ular and metabolic conditions (\"cardiometabolic\" e.g. obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease). High levels of unmet behavioral health in this population contribute to striking disparities in disease prevalence and outcomes. A behavioral health nurse provides in- hospital coaching to patients, who are then followed after discharge by a volunteer community peer mentor to assist them in overcoming barriers that may interfere with achieving and maintaining good health. Mi Puente aims to improve continuity of care and address the (physical and behavioral) health needs of the at -risk Hispanic population. This program holds promise for impactful expansion to other conditions and underserved populations. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 106 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PROGRAM (BHIP) IN DIABETES Many people find that the day -to-day tasks associated with having diabetes testing one's blood sugar, planning meals, getting enough physical activity and remembering to take medications c an be stressful. A common condition known as \"diabetes distress\" can be the result of feeling like it's all too much. Scripps Diabetes Care and Prevention has a Diabetes Behavioral Specialist on staff to help people manage their diabetes without being over whelmed or unduly distressed. The Behavioral Health Integration Program (BHIP) in Diabetes is an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to managing the emotional and behavioral needs that often leads to burnout of individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The collocation of medical and behavioral health services in the same facility allow for convenient, warm hand- off from physician to behavioral health specialist. It also affords opportunities for physicians, diabetes educators and others to receive consultation on behavioral health concerns, and in turn, more comprehensively address the multi -faceted needs of their patients with diabetes. GUIDING VETERAN 'S TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES San Diego is home to more than 250,000 veterans. A substantial number o f our service members have suffered or are struggling with Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and other psychological conditions related to military service and repeated deployments. Partnering with community -based organizations, Sc ripps is actively working to assist these veterans through informational sessions designed to improve knowledge of veteran's mental health issues and access to community -based services. Scripps is working with San Diego State University to implement a Veteran's mental health course in the Social Work Department. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES AT LOCAL SCHOOL -BASED CLINICS Scripps Family Medicine Residency and Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Wel l-Being Center have partnered to offer clinical training opportunities for Master Social Work students in training from San Diego State University at Southwest and Palomar High Schools. These students work with local providers that address the mental healt h needs of vulnerable adolescents. A variety of mental health issues are present for local high school students. Many of these issues include depression, anxiety and suicide related concerns. The program works to improve overall mental health care for local students through a school -based clinic. Approximately 240 hours were spent in the school -based clinics offering services for adolescents to an average of 12 students per week. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 107 WIDOWED SUPPORT GROUP This support group offers bereavement/mental health support and guidance to families who have lost a loved one. The group facilitates discussion and guest lectures about topics related to the loss of loved ones. There are approximately 6- 10 participants monthly that attend and many have been a part of the group for more than 15- 20 years. PATIENT COMMUNITY SERVICES Patients are referred from Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, for assistance with a wide variety of behavioral health needs including addiction, loss, anxiety and other mental health issues. The Well -Being Center offers weekly counseling and/or refer patients to local mental health counseling services. ALCOHOLIC ANONYMOUS Scripps H ealth provides meeting space for members of Alcoholic Anonymous. A fellowships of men and women who share their experience, strength and support of each other. GRIEF RECOVERY AFTER A SUBSTANCE PASSING (GRASP) Scripps Health provides meeting space for memb ers of GRASP. GRASP was founded to help provide sources of help, compassion and most of all, understanding, for families or individuals who have had a loved one die as a result of substance use or addition. NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI) SIBLIN GS SUPPORT Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of NAMI Sibling Support. This is a confidential support group for siblings of person with mental illness and adult children of parents with mental illness. SURVIVORS OF SUICIDE LOSS - SAN DIEGO CHAPTER Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of the Survivors of Suicide Loss - San Diego Chapter. The organization reaches out to and supports people who have lost a loved one to suicide. The goal is to give survivors a place where they can be comfortable expressing themselves, a place to find support, comfort, resources and hope in a judgment -free environment. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 108 SCRIPPS DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESOURCES There are in excess of 25 million illicit drug users in the US. There are an estimated 136.9 million current drinkers of alcoholic beverages and of those, approximately 23 percent binge drank in the last 30 days and 6.3 percent are considered heavy drinker s. It is estimated there are 8.7 million under -age drinkers. Substance use, particularly opioid misuse, is a health crisis that has reached epidemic proportions both nationally and locally. In San Diego, the rate of discharge from emergency departments for chronic substance use increased by 559% from 2014- 2016; rates for those 65 years and older increased the most - by 714%. The rate of discharge for opioid misuse for this age group was even more startling - it rose by 1.734% over this two year period. Rate s of discharge from emergency departments for acute substance use also rose. Rates increased for people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds; however, the most substantial increases (177%) was for Blacks. Heavy alcohol consumption is also a problem in San Diego. Nearly 20% of all adults ages 18 and older self -report excessive alcohol use. SCRIPPS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICE (SUDS) NURSES Aware of the impact drugs and alcohol can have on our community, Scripps has developed innovative ways to treating this destructive disease. Scripps has deployed specialized nurses certified in addiction; they see patients at their bedside and work closely with the patient's entire health care team to help facilitate a safe detox while hospitalized. The Substance Use Disorder Service (SUDS) nurses act in a proactive and reactive role in all of the Scripps hospitals, helping to identify patients who are at risk, or are currently experiencing withdrawal from addictive substances. This mobile group of sp ecially trained drug and alcohol resource nurses provide education, interventions and discharge placement assistance to patients in the Scripps hospitals. The resource nurses work directly with the nursing staff at each of the hospitals in search of patien ts who may be at risk for alcohol/drug withdrawal and assist with implementing a standardized protocol withdrawal process. Scripps has changed the way we deliver drug and alcohol treatment by col laborating with others to deliver a continuum of care that improves the health of our community. When patients need additional care, Scripps has linked itself to t wo separate treatment programs designed to meet the community needs. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 109 BETTY FORD CENTER In 20 16, Scripps partnered with the Betty Ford Center, which expanded its drug and alcohol treatment programming into San Diego. This treatment center brings world- renowned alcohol and drug rehab to more people through weekday and weeknight outpatient services. FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS OF SAN DIEGO Family Health Centers of San Diego provides an array of services, including outpatient drug and alcohol treatment along with medication- assisted treatment and harm reduction programs. Their service also include individual counseling and one- on-one support, educational sessions, HIV resting, Hepatitis B& C testing and treatment. OPIOID STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM (OSP) The Opioid Stewardship Program has spearheaded multiple projects at Scripps to educate patients and providers about the risks of opioids and the benefits of alternative multi- modal pain management options to reduce opioid use. The program has established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a 25 percent reduction in the number of opioid pills per prescr iption at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers in 2018. Scripps also has opened three drug take- back kiosks at its on -site pharmacies, offering patients year -round access to dispose of unused, unneeded or outdated medications . 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNIT Y BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 110 SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Per Section 2, Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), in addition to the health outcome needs that were identified in the CHNA, social determinants of health were a key theme in all of the community engagement activities. Analysis of results from the communi ty partner discussions and key i nformant interviews revealed the most commonly associated social determinants of health for each of the top health needs. The top ten social determinan ts were consistently referenced across the different community engagement activities, food insecurity & access to healthy food, access to care or services, homeless/housing issues, physical activity, education/knowledge, cultural competency, transportation, insurance issues, stigma and poverty. The importance of these social determinants was also confirmed by quantitative data. Approximately 80 percent of modifiable risks for diseases are attributable to non- medical (upstream) determinants of health, such as health behaviors, socioeconomic status, and environmental conditions. To prevent chronic conditions and promote health, greater emphasis should be placed on population health, which has been defined to focus on outcomes as well as on the broader factors that influence heath at a population level, including medical care systems, the social environment, and the physical environment. 30 FOOD INSECURITY Food Insecurity is the inability to afford enough food for an active, healthy life. The HASD&IC 2016 CHNA identified food insecurity and access to healthy food as the top social determinant impacting San Diego's priority health needs (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and behavioral health). According to the latest research from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, alm ost half a million San Diegans, 1 in 7 residents, or 15 percent of the San Diego County population are considered to be food insecure, an economic and social condition characterized by limited or uncertain access to adequate food. To put the total number of food insecure San Diegans into perspective, it is roughly equivalent to the entire populations of Chula Vista, Oceanside, Imperial Beach, Coronado, and Solana Beach combined. Rates i n Imperial County are even higher, with 17% of the general population suffering food insecurity. Even more alarming is that the rate of food insecurity among children in Imperial County is the highest in California at over 33%. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 111 30 UCLA Center for Healt h Policy Research. \"Emerging Models of Diabetes and Hypertension Prevention in Los Angeles\", Ying_Ying Meng, Susan H. Babey, Natalie Bradford and Tony Kuo. November 2017. The CalFresh Program, federally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), issues monthly electronic benefits that can be used to buy foods at participating markets and stores. More than 290,000 San Diegans receive CalFresh. An additional one in five San Diegans were food secure but relied on supplemental nutrition assistance to support their food budget. 30 In 2016, 21 percent of households in San Diego County participated in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 23.3 percent of those below 138 percent of the FPL were eligible for such bene fits. 31 Refer to table 4 for SNAP participation and eligibility in San Diego County.

Studies demonstrate that hunger significantly impacts health. Lack of access to healthy food, often due to availability and cost, are stressors that contribute to diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other behavioral health issues in a myriad of ways: Food insecure adults with diabetes have higher average blood sugars. Food i nsecure adults are more likely to be obese. Food i nsecurity is significantly more prevalent in adults wi th mood disorders. Food i nsecurity is associated with increased risk of suicidal thoughts and substance use in adolescents. Food i nsecure seniors have a significantly higher likelihood of heart disease, depression and limited activities of daily living. Food insecure adults delay buying food in order to purchase medications. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 112 31 San Diego Hunger Coalition.

The programs highlighted below are ways that Scripps Health is addressing food insecurity ; screenings and eligibility benefits . SCRIPPS HEALTH CALFRESH SCREENINGS As health care delivery systems moves towards a population health paradigm that incentivizes keeping patient's healthy, hospitals and clinics are recognizing the significance of addressing social determinants of health, such as Food Insecurity (FI). Hospitals have been more proactive in intervening at some level of care to aid the individuals suffering from FI and their ability to gain control over their health. Accordingly, food assistance provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - known as CalFresh in California, significantly reduces the rate and severity of poverty throughout the state (California Budget & Policy Center, 2018). While SNAP and Women's, Infants, Children (WIC) have been successful in assisting low-income children and their families with additional funding for purchasing healthy foods, there is evidence that suggests screening for FI in healthcare settings is the best indicator for patients to access food- related assistance. Scripps Health began screening for CalFresh in June 2017 through the support of the Public Resource Specialist (PRS) team. The PRS are experienced staff with strong knowledge of the Coun ty programs. They screen all uninsured patients who have received services at any of the five Scripps hospital facilities. The in- house application process can take up to 45 minutes as they are screening for multiple programs concurrently. Once an applicat ion has been completed, the PRS staff submits it to the County via the Hospital Outstation Services (HOS) program. Once submitted, a County HOS worker is assigned and the PRS team tracks the application, advocating for the patients throughout the process t hat can take up to 45 days to receive an eligibility response. In some instances having to go through the appeal process that may add an additional 30 days. In doing so, the PRS team helps patient's maneuver a complex application process that otherwise may deter them from seeking much needed acute and preventative care. The team has been successful in having the important conversation about food insecurity with 36% of the patients they have screened in this past fiscal year.

FOOD FINDERS - RESCUING FOOD, REDUCING HUNGER Scripps Corporate Food Service partnered with Food Finders, a multi -regional food bank and food rescue program that connects businesses to charitable institutions in need of donations. Food Finders connected Scripps with Interfaith Community Services in Escondido, which distributes food to people in need. All leftover food from Scripps Corporate facilities is packaged, picked up each day and transferred to the Scripps 4S Ranch Food and Nutrition Services freezer for storage. The cost is minimal, as Scripps uses the same amount of labor to package the food as it would to dispose of it, an d unsold \"grab and go\" items are already packaged. Interfaith Community Services picks up the frozen food twice per week and transports it to one of their facilities to help feed the community. Between food donated by Scripps and others, Interfaith distri butes an average of 126,000 hot meals and packed lunches and 23,000 emergency meals, feeding approximately 17,000 people every year. FOSTERING VOLUNTEERISM Scripps believes that health improvement begins when people take an active role in making a positive impact on their community. For this reason, Scripps supports volunteer programs for Scripps employees and affiliated physicians who want to make an even larger impact on their community. Scripps matches the talents and interests of employees and physicians with community needs, such as mentoring partnerships with local schools and providing free medical and surgical care for patients in need. In addition to the financial community benefit contributions made during FY 18, Scripps employees and affiliated phy sicians donated a significant portion of their personal time volunteering to support Scripps sponsored community benefit programs. With close to 10,191 hours, the estimated dollar value of this volunteer labor is $ 507,887.44 *, which is not included in the Scripps FY18 community benefit programs and services totals.

Participants receive information and resources, reinforce inner strengths, learn self -care strategies, develop encouraging peer relationships and continue a life of meaning and purpose. The breast cancer support group recognizes the special needs of women who have suffered from breast cancer. Group members share experiences, information, hopes, fears and strengths in a relaxed setting. PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Quality health care is highly dependent upon health education systems and medical research programs. Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers, or offer conti nuing education to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care would be greatly diminished. Medical research also plays an important role in improving the community's overall health by developing new and innovative treatments. Each year, Scripps Encinitas allocates resour ces to advance health care services through professional education health programs and research.

Nevertheless, the service is provided because it meets an identified community need, which if no longer offered would either be unavailable in the area or fall to government or another not -for-profit organization. Subsidized services do not include ancillary services that support lines, such as lab and radiology (if these services are provided to low -income persons, they are reported as charity care/financial assistance). The total expense for subsidized health services for Scripps Mercy F iscal Year 2018 was $ 3,817,785. This includes Scripps inpatient behavioral health and Mercy Clinic. Scripps offers inpatient adult behavioral health services at the Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego campus. The Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program also actively supports community programs to reduce the stigma of mental illness and help affected individuals live and work in the community. 340 B DRUG PRICING PROGRAM AND IN-LIEU OF FUNDS Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Chula Vista participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Designated as a disproportionate share hospital (DSH), Scripps Mercy is eligible to purchase outpatient drugs at a reduced price, allowing it to stretch scarce federal resources as far as po ssible, reaching more eligible patients, and providing more comprehensive services. Scripps uses the 340B savings to keep our costs down so we can keep our doors open. Scripps Mercy provides care to a large number of patients who either lack health insurance or are covered through a government subsidy program. One way Scripps Mercy is able to provide care to some of our most needy patients is through in- lieu of funds. In- lieu of funds are used for unfunded or underfunded patients and their post -discharge needs. Funds are used for board and care, skilled nursing facilities, long -term acute care and home health. In addition, funds are also used for medications, equipment and transportation services. The total subsidized expense for in- lieu of funds for Mercy H ospital during FY18 was $536,138. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 168 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INPATIENT PROGRAMS Individuals suffering from acute psychiatric disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to themselves or others. In such cases, hospitalization may be the most appropriate alternative. Scripps Mercy Hospital's Behavioral Health Inpatient Program helps patients and their loved ones work through short -term crises, manage mental illness and resume their daily lives. Challenges Like many behavioral health programs across the country, funding is difficult, as payment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In FY 2018, the Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program experienced a $ 4.7 million loss in total operations however $3.3 million of th is is captured in Medi - Cal/CMS and charity care. In FY 2018, 2.0 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT SERVICES Scripps Behavioral Health entered into an agreement in May 2016 to transition the intensive behavioral health outpatient program to the Family Health Centers of San Diego and expand outpatient behavioral health offerings to the population served. SCRIPPS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH A-VISIONS VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM The innovative A -Visions Vocational Training Program at the San Diego campus helps prepare mental health patients for volunteer and employment opportunities by exposing them to a variety of work activ ities and training. The total expense for the A -Visions program for FY18 was $ 147,296,150 . Since its inception, 575 inquiries have come in, 155 of these resulted in qualified candidates with 96 volunteers and 52 employees thus far . Currently, there are a total of 24 active candidates : 20 employees and four volunteers who participate in this supportive employment program. A-Visions participants have been employed on a per -diem basis by Scripps in Environmental Services, Food Services and clerical support for Health and Information Services, Emergency Services, Nursing Research, Human Resources , Access, Behavioral Health, Credentialing, Labor and Delivery, Laboratory, Medical Staffing, Performance Improvement, Spiritual Care and Palliative Care Services. Paid A -Visions candidates typically limit their work to eight hours per week, which allows them to maintain eligibility for their disability benefits, medications and ongoing behavioral healthcare t hat supports their work. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 169 MERCY CLINIC OF SCRIPPS MERCY HOSPITAL , SAN DIEGO Founded in 1944 and integrated into Mercy Hospital in 1961, Mercy Clinic of Scripps Mercy Hospital is a primary care clinic that treats more than 1,000 patients each month.

MAKING A FINANCIAL COMMITMENT During FY 18, Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute devoted $191,376 to community benefit programs, including uncompensated health care, community health services, professional education and health research. The programs offered by Scripps Whittier emphasize community based prevention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greater risk for health problems. The diabetes epidemic permeates every facet of our community. The percentage of individuals entering hospitals with diabetes is rising, the number of children developing diabetes is growing, and larger number s of people are experiencing complications from diabetes, such as renal failure and heart disease, at an earlier age. Developing unique and innovative clinical programs and community -based research is urgently needed to combat this epidemic. The diabetes and obesity epidemic have a disproportionate impact on low -income ethnic groups, yet there is little research demonstrating clinically and cost -effective care and treatment models for these populations. Diabetes leads to school and work absenteeism , elevated hospitalization rates, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death. Diabetes is an important health need because of its prevalence, its impact on morbidity and mortality, and its preventability. Diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke and an analysis of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 2016 'Diabetes mellitus' was the seventh leading cau se of death. The percentage of adults aged 20 and older who have ever been diagnosed with diabetes was 9.4% in 2017 in San Diego County and has been steadily rising since 2005 according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervention because hospitalizations du e to diabetes related complications are potentially preventable with proper management and a healthy lifestyle More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15- 30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. This is especially true in the South Bay 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 215 communities in San Diego. Specifically, the city of Chula Vista is home to 26,000 Latinos with diagnosed diabetes and thousands mor e who are undiagnosed, have prediabetes and are at high risk of developing diabetes. PROJECT DULCE MODEL 22 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE The key element s of Project Dulce are m ultidisciplinary clinical teams and peer educators ( Promotoras ) who work together to improve health and empower patients. This model has improved clinical outcomes for glucose, blood pressure and LDL- C. It has improved behavior outcomes and patient satisfaction and l owered costs to the health system through fewer ER visits and hospitalizations. Over 25,000 individuals have been treated in San Diego alone. 49 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 216 49 Philis -Tsimikas A, et al.

SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER REGISTRY Since 1975, the Scripps Cancer Registry has been collecting cancer data on Scripps patients for research, epidemiological studies, education and patient treatment. Analysis of this data gives Scripps physicians the ability to measure the quality and effectiveness of the care cancer patients receive within the Scripps system. Data also aids in determining which Cancer Center programs should be developed or further expanded. SCRIPPS CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER (SCRC) Research and clinical discovery has been part of Scripps Health's mission since its founding in 1924. Scripps Clinical Research Center consolidates and expands access to clinical research trials for physicians and patients across the Scripps system and in all the communities Scripps serves. The research mission is to provide comprehensive, expert support for Scripps physicians and staff, so that they may provide patients with access to new and emerging treatment opportunities when appropriate. In addition, Scrip ps coordinates its research with nationally accredited continuing and graduate medical education programs. In 2008, Scripps Clinical Research (CRS) was created to support clinical research throughout the Scripps system. CRS supports more than 25+ medical specialties under one administration team. As a result, it accelerates the access to new technologies for physicians and patients by consolidating the various components of clinical investigation into a seamless, streamlined regulatory and administrative process. Scripps continues building in its strong foundation for clinical and translational research through small pilot studies to large multicenter trials placed at all Scripps hospitals engaging both inpatient and outpatient settings. As ambulatory -based research increases across the system, Scripps supports more than 150 principal investigators and about 350 active clinical research protocols crossi ng interdisciplinary disease categories. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 227 SCRIPPS CLINICAL RESEARCH TRIALS Arthritis Cancer (various tumor sites) Cardiology Cardiac Stem Cell Chronic Lung Disease Cosmetic Procedures Dermatology Diabetes Proton Therapy Eye Infections Eye-Macular Degeneration Eye-Cataracts Genomic Directed Growth Hormone Deficiency Hepatitis C High Cholesterol Joint Replacement (hip, shoulder, knee, cartilage stem cell) Liver Disease Migraine Headaches Neuro Imaging Nephrology Obesity/Weight Loss Organ Transplant Osteoporosis Orthopedics Parkinson's Disease Stroke Sleep SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES INSTITUTE AND SCRIPPS RESEARCH TRANSLATIONAL INSTITUTE (SRTI) PARTNERSHIP The Scripps Research Translational Institute (SRTI) partners with Scripps Health to combine strong patient care and clinical research capabilities with the exceptional biomedical science expertise of Scripps Research to leverage the power of genomic medicine a nd digital medicine technologies, for the advancement of individualized medicine. SRTI is dedicated to accelerating the \"translation\" of basic laboratory discoveries into clinical trials and ultimately approved treatments. Under the direction of Scripps R esearch, SRTI is supported in part by the National Institutes of Health Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA). A five-year, $20 million grant to support translational clinical research, infrastructure and training first awarded in 2008 was renewed in 2013 and renewed again in 2018 for its 3 rd five-year NIH grant through 2023 for $31.5 million. The SRTI Community Engagement Program (SRTI -CEP) and the Clinical Translational Academic Research Core are led by the Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute, which has provided the San Diego community with the most advanced diabetes care, education, research and support for more than 30 years. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 228 The Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute, in partnership with the San Diego State University South Bay Latino Research Center, currently holds three, five- year awards from the National institutes of Health worth nearly $9M to develop culturally -tailored interventions to improve outcomes for diverse, predominant ly underserved individuals living with chronic cardio -metabolic conditions. The first award trains medical assistants to provide health coaching to patients with type 2 diabetes as part of routine primary care in two diverse health systems - i.e., Scripps Health and Neighborhood Healthcare, a federally -qualified health system that provides care to a low income, predominantly Hispanic, patient population. The second study uses mobile health (mHealth) technology to deliver a personalized, diabetes self -management education and support program to Hispanic patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The final award evaluates Mi Puente, or \"My Bridge,\" which is a Behavioral Health Nurse + Community Mentor approach to prevent hospital readmissions and impr ove quality of life among Hispanics with multiple chronic conditions and behavioral health concern(s) admitted to a safety -net hospital near the US -Mexico border. In addition to leading its own Community Engagement Research (CEnR) projects in diabetes and cardio metabolic disease, Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute enhances the involvement of community and clinicians in other areas of translational and transformational research through the resources provided by the Academic Research Core, such as a researc h navigator, biostatistician and community engagement program manager. Scripps supports CEnR that aims to bring researchers and community partners together to share their knowledge, skills and resources with a common goal of improving community health. Over the last two decades, health research and practice has increasingly employed CEnR, defined as \"the process of working collaboratively with and through groups of people affiliated by geographic proximity, special interests, or similar situations to addres s issues affecting the wellbeing of those people.\" SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICES Scripps System wide Community Benefit Services provides oversight, support, guidance and coordination of Scripps community health and outreach programs, helping ensure that they are in accordance with the Scripps mission, values and strategic objectives.

Scripps Health has been a longtime supporter of 2- 1-1 San Diego' s Health Navigation Program which creates a record for every person who calls, in order to provide a service that navigates clients through different referrals and tracks their success toward achieving improved social determinants of health. All 2- 1-1 staf f are trained to identify individuals who are in need of care coordination services, particularly individuals who are having difficulties managing their chronic health conditions. Health Navigators are trained to determine client risk using the Risk Rating Scale (RRS). The RRS determines 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 236 a client's status ranging from \"In Crisis\" to \"Thriving\" using social determinants of health such as housing, nutrition, primary care and health m anagement. Health Navigators evaluate on the following to determine whether a client has decreased in vulnerability for health management: Understanding of prescription medication: Does the client understand how and when to take their medicine and do they understand the use/importance of each medication? Health Condition Management: Does the client understand the illness/disease that they have been diagnosed with, what their prognosis is, and what they need to do in order to remain healthy? Health Insurance/Medical Home: Does the client have health insurance and do they know how to utilize it? Does the client have a primary care doctor and/or specialists that they see and do they know how to make appointments with each? Does the client know in what situation they should make an appointment with their Primary Care Physician vs. going to an Emergency Room for an immediate medical need? Transportation: Does the client have the means to get to their doctor's appointments? During this grant period 2- 1-1 provided care coordination services to 576 cli ents with complex chronic conditions. Clients decreased vulnerability in the following social determinants of health: housing, nutrition, primary care, and health management by 67%. Clients also reported feeling better to manage their health condition by 71% increase. 2- 1-1 Health Navigators provided individualized needs assessments, case planning, information, education and referrals and provided ongoing client contact and progress checks via phone over a period of time relevant to the client's needs to check on and document client progress .

Other community building activities that protect or improve the community's health or safety that are not described in the categories listed in lines a. through h. above. Community Health Improvement S ervices - activities or programs, subsidized by the hospital, carried out or supported for the express purpose of improving community health. Community Health Needs Assessment R eport (CHNA) - the written report adopted for the hospital facility by an authorized body of the hospital facility. Community Health Needs - those requisites for improvement or maintenance of health status in the community. Cost A ccounting - Cost accounting systems generally provide the most accurate portrayal of the true cost of community benefit activities. Measurement of the costs associated with specific activities and programs to provide information meaningful to management. For example, cost accounting is used to determine the amount of an organization's total expense that reasonably can be attributed to community benefit, to assign indirect (overhead) expense to the direct cost of a program, and to estimate the cost associated with serving a subset of patients, such as Medicaid recipients. Direct Costs - \"Direct costs\" means salaries and benefits, supplies, and other expenses directly related to the actual conduct of each activity or program. Direct Offsetting R evenue - Revenue from the activity during the year that offsets the total community benefit expense of that activity. Includes any revenue generated by the activity or program, such as reimbursement for services provided to program 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 248 patients. Direct offsetting rev enue also includes restricted grants or contributions that the organization uses to provide a community benefit, such as a restricted grant to provide financial assistance or fund research. Direct offsetting revenue does not include unrestricted grants or contributions that the organization uses to provide a community need. Health R esearch - can include, but is not limited to, clinical research, community health research, and generalizable studies on health care delivery. Hospital Provider F ees - States have some form of Medicaid provider tax (or fees and assessments) in place. Through these arrangements, providers pay funds to states that then are appropriated to Medicaid agencies and serve as a source of matching funds that yields federal Medicaid revenue. These fees are included in community benefit accounting as Medicaid cost, and any revenues they yield also included in Medicaid \"direct offsetting revenue\". Implementation S trategy - the written document that describes the hospital facility's strategy to meet the community health needs identified through the hospital facility's Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) . In-Kind C ontributions - Donations made (or received) using resources that are not legal tender (e.g., cash, checks, credit cards). Donati ons of supplies (e.g., pharmaceuticals), equipment, or staff time that benefits another organization are examples of in- kind contributions. In community benefit accounting, in- kind contributions are valued fairly. For example, the hospital donates a two- year old computer to a community clinic. The community benefit expense would be $1,000 if the computer was purchased for $3,000 and after two years of use it has depreciated to a value on the books of the hospital of $1,000. In-Lieu of Funds - Funds used f or unfunded or under -funded patients and their post - discharge needs. Funds are used for board and care, skilled nursing facilities, long -term acute care, and home health. In addition funds are also used for medications, equipment, and transportation servi ces. Net Community Benefit E xpense - Total community benefit expense minus direct offsetting revenue. Other Means -Tested Government P rograms - Government -sponsored health programs where eligibility for benefits or coverage is determined by income or assets. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 249 Examples include: the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), or the California Children's Services (CCS) Program. Payer - Insurance companies, health care service plans, M edicare, Medi -Cal and other private or public entities that pay hospitals for health care provided to their sponsored patients. Professional Education and Health R esearch - includes clinical research as well as professional education of non-Scripps employees including graduate medical education (GME), nursing resource development, and other health care professional training. Costs for medical residents and interns may be included as health professions educations costs. Calculations based on total program ex pense. Restricted C ontributions (Grants) - Donations, gifts, bequests and other transfers of money or property made by a donor or grantor that has stipulated a temporary or permanent use for the resources provided. Donors or grantors provide restricted contributions with the intent of supporting a particular activity or program. Restrictions generally are stated in writing by the donor or grantor when they make a gift or grant. Subsidized Health S ervices - Patient care services the organization provides despite a financial loss, (even) after remov ing the effects of charity care and Medi -Cal shortfalls (and bad debt). Clinical programs provided at a loss because they are needed by the community. The service meets an identified community need if it is reasonable to conclude that if the organization n o longer offered the service, the service would be unavailable in the community, the community's capacity to provide the service would be below the community's need, or the service would become the responsibility of government or another tax -exempt organiz ation. Example of such services are: inpatient psychiatric units, satellite clinics serving low- income communities and burn units. Total Community Benefit E xpense - Total gross expense of the activity incurred during the year. Uncompensated Health C are - Includes charity, under -reimbursed care and bad debt. Shortfalls are derived using the payer based cost allocation methodology. Bad debt and charity care are estimated by extracting the gross write offs of bad debt and charity care charges and applying the hospital RCC to estimate net uncompensated cost. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 250 Under -Reimbursed C are - Care that is reimbursed below cost by County Medical Services, Medi -Cal and Medi -Cal HMO, Medicare, Medicare PPO, Medicare HMO and SHPS Medicare. Unrestricted C ontributions (Grants ) - Donations, gifts, bequests and other transfers of money or property that are free from any external restrictions and are available for general use. Volunteer H ours - includes the labor hours contributed by Scripps employees and affiliated physicians i n support of Scripps -sponsored activities for which no compensation is received. The dollar value is not included in Scripps' \"community benefit contribution.\" 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 251 APPENDIX B SCRIPPS UNCOMPENSATED CARE METHODOLOGY FISCAL YEAR 2018 Scripps continues to contribute resources to provide low and no- cost health care services to populations in need. During fiscal year 2018, Scripps contributed $358,318,252 to uncompensated health car e, $20,245,366 in charity care, $331,743,910 in Medi -Cal and Medicare shortfall, and $6,328,976 in bad debt. Schedule H Methodology \u2014 Schedule H requires the uncompensated care to be divided into four categories: Charity care, under -reimbursed Medi -Cal and Other Means - Tested Government Programs, Bad Debt, and under -reimbursed Medicare. Bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reportable under the Schedule H guidelines but do not count towards the community benefit totals. Thus, the categories are reported in a specific order/hierarchy. Charity Care and under -reimbursed Medi -Cal and Other Means -Tested Government Programs are counted first. Charity Care Methodology \u2014 Uncompensated cost is estimated by appl ying ratio - cost-to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross charity adjustments. The following costs are excluded: Community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. Traditional Charity Care is included in the Internal Revenue Service (I RS) Form 990 Schedule H Part I Line 7a. Medi -Cal Shortfall \u2014 The shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare, Medicare PPO, Medicare HMO, Medicare Capitated program at the hospitals, Medi -Cal, Medi- Cal HMO, and CMS primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: Net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the account balance for all open accoun ts, plus revenue from uncompensated care pools including Medi -Cal DSH. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the McKesson HPM system. The following costs are excluded: Charity adjustments at cost for Medi -Cal patients, communi ty health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 schedule H Part I Line 7b. In the State of California the Medicaid program is called Medi -Cal. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 252 Medicar e and Medicare HMO Hospitals \u2014 Shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare and Medicare Senior primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the capitation account balance for all open accounts, plus other revenue including. Cost is derived using the relative value alloc ation methodology per the McKesson HPM cost accounting system. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B. Bad Debt Methodology \u2014 Uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio- cost- to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross bad debt adjustments less recoveries. The following costs are excluded: Bad debt adjustments at cost for Medi -Cal and CMS patients, community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section A. Shortfall Methodology Clinics \u2014 Shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare and Medicare Senior primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the capitation account balance for all open accounts, plus other revenue including. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the McKesson HPM cost accounting system. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B. Hospital Provider Fee Program The State of California enacted legislation for a hospital fee program to fund certain Medi -Cal coverage expansions. The program charges hospitals a quality assuranc e fee that is used to obtain federal matching funds for Medi -Cal with the proceeds redistributed as supplemental payments to California hospitals that treat Medi -Cal patients. There are two hospital fee programs that had activity in 2017 and 2018: a 36 month hospital fee program covering the period from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019. Historically, the Organization's policy was to record revenue and expense upon approval of the program. During 2018, the Organization determined that, for all hospital fee programs through 2018, the supplemental payments met all criteria related to revenue recognition and the quality assurance fees are both probable and estimable. Accordingly, all related supplemental payments have been recognized as revenue and related quality assurance fees have been recognized as expense as of September 30, 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 253 2018. Federal and state payments received from these programs are included as provider fee revenue in net patient revenue, and fees paid or payable to the state and California Healt h Foundation and Trust (CHFT) are included in provider fee expense in operating expenses. The Organization recorded a net benefit of $55,253,000 during 2018, with $20,401,000 from the 36 month program, and $34,852,000 from the 30-month program. Provider f ee program revenue recorded for the years ended September 30 is summarized below (in thousands): 2018 2017 Provider fee revenue $ 241,538 $ 41,804 Provider fee expense (183,990) (36,368) CHFT fee (2,295) (90) Net operating income from provider fee $ 55,253 $ 5,346 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 254 APPENDIX C 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 255 APPENDIX D SAN DIEGO COUNTY HHSA GEOGRAPHIC County of San Diego: https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/live_well_san_diego/indicators/Map_and_Re gional_Data.pdf Central North Coastal East North Inland North Central South Central San Diego Mid-City Southeast San Diego Carlsbad Del Mar Oceanside Mesa Laguna/Pine Valley Lakeside Lemon Mountain Empire Santee Spring Valley Springs Escondido Fallbrook North San Diego Palomar/Julian Pauma Poway Ramona San Marcos Valley Center Coastal Elliott Navajo Kearny Mesa Mira Mesa Miramar Peninsula University Chula Vista Coronado National City South Bay Sweetwater 1These regions have been designated by the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) for the purpose of service delivery.

In 1994, California legislators passed Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), which requires all private not -for-profit hospitals in the state to conduct a CHNA every three years. Since 1994, these programs have been created based on an assessment of needs identified through hospital data, community input, and major trends. Previous collaborations among not -for-profit hospitals, healthcare systems, and other community partners have resulted in numerous well regarded Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) reports. Information is gathered through the CHNA for the purposes of reporting community benefit, developing strategic plans, creating annual reports, providing input on legislative decisions, and informing the general community of health issues and trends. Federal Requirements In 2010, Congress added several new requirements for hospital organizations to maintain federal income tax exempt status under Section 501 (r) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\") as part of the Affordable Care Act. One of the requirements set forth in Section 501 (r) of the Code is for each hospital organization to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) at least once every three tax years. The requirement to conduct a CHNA applies to Scripps Health, which is a health system that operates four hospital facilities. In addition, Scripps Health must adopt a triennial Implementation Plan which is a separate written document to address certain community heal th needs identified in the CHN A. Additional information on the ACA requirements for nonprofit hospitals can be found at www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations\". 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 257 Required Components of the Community Health Needs Assessment Per IRS requirements, (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r) -3(b) (6) (i)) the following are components the CHNA must include: A description of the community served by the health system and how it was determined A desc ription of the processes and methods used to conduct the assessment A description of how the hospital organization took into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility Prioritized description of all of the community health needs identified through the CHNA, as well as a description of the process and criteria used in prioritizing such health needs. A description of the existing health care facilities and other resources with the community available to meet the community health needs identified in the CHNA. An evaluation of the impact of any actions that were taken since the hospital finished conducting its immediately preceding CHNA to address the significant health needs identified in the prior CHNA. Make the CHNA widely available to the public via the hospital's website. Required Components of the Implementation Strategy Provisions in the Affordable Care Act permit a hospital facility that adopts a joint CHNA report to also adopt a joint implementation strategy which, with respect to each significant health need identified through the joint CHNA, either describes how one or more collaborating facilities plan to address the health need or identifies the health need as one collaborating facilities do not intend to address. The join implementation strategy adopted for the hospital facility must: (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r) -3(c) (4). Meet community health needs identified in the CHNA. Describe any needs identified in the CHNA that are not being addressed and the reasons for not addressing them Be clearly identified as applying to the hospital facility Clearly identify the hospital facility's particular roles and responsibilities in taking the actions described in the implementation strategy, and the programs and resources the hospital facility plans to commit to such actions Include a summary or other tool that helps the reader easily locate those portions of the joint implementation strategy that relates to the hospital facility. 2019 SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN & REPORT 258 APPENDIX F SCRIPPS HEALTHCARE PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATI ONS The list below highlights Scripps community partners and coalitions in Fiscal Year 2018.
