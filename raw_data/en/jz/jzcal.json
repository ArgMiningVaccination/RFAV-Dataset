Often it is not just the medical condition that is present. that needs support. My skills as a Naturopath, Herbalist,and Energy Healer allows me to make an assessment for the best result for your recovery.As well as support your body nutritionally with herbal tonics nutrients and gentle exercise. You should treat your body like a temple and with the same sacred regard. Within our bodies cells we store the memories of our experiences in life some minor, some major occasionally traumatic, You need to transform these memories so you are able to move forward in life to achieve your full potential.There are many ways to help with this transformation, spiritual healing / reiki can facilitate a connection to your subcontious mind to aid understanding and resolve around the issue which troubles you. As you release old traumas different organs in our body which relate to the emotional component often need nutritional and herbal support. Also at this time a nurturing touch such as Reflexology can be very affective for supporting the whole body system. Flower essences can be used throughout the process to help move through the difficulties and eventual release of the memories to the point of no reaction. Thus allowing you to move forward in life and fullfill your true potential.
