SpaceNews reports: SpaceX fired the Raptor engines in the Super Heavy booster designated Booster 9 in a static-fire test at its Starbase test site in Boca Chica, Texas, at approximately 1:35 p.m. Eastern Aug. 25. SpaceX said it conducted a \"full duration\" firing, which appeared to last about five to six seconds. SpaceX later [stated](https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1695158759717474379)that all 33 engines successfully ignited, although two shut down prematurely. \"Congratulations to the SpaceX team on this exciting milestone!\" The company did not state if that performance was sufficient for it to proceed with a launch attempt, but it was better than an earlier test of the same booster Aug. 6.
