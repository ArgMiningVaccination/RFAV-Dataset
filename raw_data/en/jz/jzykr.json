TIM14.15.COB.NV Page 54 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] IX. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) You or Your Covered Dependents may have insurance coverage under more than one Plan . If benefits are available through any other Plan, We will take those benefits into account in calculating the amount of Cov ered Charges that may be payable by Us so that benefits from both Us and any other Plan are limited t o the actual charges Incurred. If a Covered Person is entitled to benefits provided by another Plan but does not claim them, We will consider the benefits to which a Covered Person is entitled as benefits that were provided. All claims should be submitted to Us and all other Plans at the same time so that proper benefits can be determined and paid. Definitions In addition to any specific terms that are def ined under the Definitions section, the following capitalized terms are used in this section, and have the meanings given below: 1. Allowable Charge: An Allowable Charge is any charge which is a Covered Charge under this plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Plan . If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value fo r each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Plan . The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi -private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge un less the private room is Medically Necessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge . If both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allo wable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts. 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combined benefits received from all Plans. 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Plan is in force. 4. Plan: Any Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to: a. Group, non- group (ind ividual), blanket, or franchise insurance that provides major medical benefits. b. Group -type insurance which can be obtained and maintained only as the result of membership in or connection with a specific group or organization. c. A service plan or contract, group or individual practice or other prepayment plan. d. Any employer or employee self -insurance plan. e. Coverage arranged by or through any trustee, union, employer, or association. f. Health coverage, whether issued or administered on a group or individual basi s. g. Group Blue Cross, group Blue Shield, group practice, or prepaid group coverage. h. Coverage under trust or association plans or plans sponsored by unions, employer groups, or employee benefit groups. TIM14.15.COB.NV Page 55 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] i. Medical coverage under aut omobile or no fault insurance, if coordination of benefits with such coverage is allowed by law. Plan does no t include any of the following: a. An accident insurance plan. b. Medicaid. c. A group hospital indemnity insurance plan of $500 per day or less. d. A plan covering only ancillary benefits. e. A limited benefit insurance plan. 5. Primary Plan: A Plan in which benefits must be determined without considering the benefits of any ot her Plan. A Plan is primary if: a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this plan ; or b. According to the Order of Benefit Determination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first. 6. Secondary Plan: A Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Plan have been deter mined. How Benefits Are Paid If We are the Primary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. If We are the Secondary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provision below, We will pay the lesser of: 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. When We are the Secondary Plan, the benefits payable under this plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment. Order of Benefit Determination The Primary Plan and Secondary Plan are determined by using the following rules . Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Plan is the Primary Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. 1. A Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first. TIM14.15.COB.NV Page 56 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] 2. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Plan that covers the person as a dependent. 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated: a. The Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in t he year pays its benefits first . It does not matter which parent is older. b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first. c. If one Plan has this birthday rul e and the other Plan does not and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first. 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced: a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Plan of that parent pays its benefits before any other Plan that covers the child as a dependent . This applies only if the Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree . b. Otherwise, the Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the parent without cus tody. c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above. 5. A Plan that covers the perso n as the I nsured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before those of a Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured. However, if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Plan providing the continued coverage. 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first. Rights Under T his Section We have the right to: 1. Release or obtain claim information from any Plan, individual or entity. 2. Pay Our covered benefits to any Plan or entity which has paid benefits that We should have paid. TIM14.15.COB.NV Page 57 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] 3. Recover any overpayment made by Us from the person or entity to whom the payment was made.

A Covered Person must cooperate with Us, and assist Us by obtaining the following information within 30 days of Our request .

Submitted charges may be applied to the Covered Person's Deductible without review . Application of the charges to the Deductible does not guarantee future coverage of similar expenses. We reserve the right to review any and all claims for eligibility for coverage at the time each claim is submitted . You may request a review while claims are being applied to the Deductible by calling Our Home Office or writing to Us . Any amount We pay in good faith will release Us fr om further liability for that amount. Payment by Us does not constitute any assumption of liability for coverage of a Sickness or an Injury.
