Method: Double-blind, randomized trial of 46 pre-pubertal patients, between 4 and 14 years of age, with normal growth rates. The subjects were divided into two groups, each with 23 individuals (Group I: Placebo; Group II: Vitamin A in a single megadose), and were evaluated at moments A and B with a six month interval. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in serum retinol levels, anthropometry, growth velocity, or body composition, between moments A and B, in Group II. Carotenoids were significantly lower in Group I at moment B. The semi-quantitative food intake questionnaire showed that approximately 60.9% of the children and adolescents ingested less than half of the amounts of retinol and carotenoids recommended by the Food Guide Pyramid. Inadequate intake was more prevalent regarding vegetable and fruit carotenoid sources, with 75 and 70% of inadequacy, respectively. Conclusion: If one considers the inadequate food intake observed in the dietary evaluation in this study, it is possible that multiple micronutrient deficiencies could be involved in statural deficits. This could explain why vitamin A supplementation does not seem to influence growth in children and adolescents with statural deficit, as indicated by the present study. Thus in populations such as the one studied here, the supplementation with vitamin A should be integrated into comprehensive nutritional interventions, so as to possibly promote greater positive impact on linear growth.
