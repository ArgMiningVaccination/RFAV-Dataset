As infections and the death toll rise, we turn to God for wisdom and comfort.", "sitename": "World Vision", "date": "2022-01-10", "cleaned_text": "As we face the two-year mark of the coronavirus pandemic, the world's needs have shifted. More than [300 million people have been infected](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), and the death toll is over 5.4 million people. News of new variants continues, and the disease has impacted about 192 countries, prompting World Vision to launch [our global COVID-19 response](/coronavirus-response) in March 2020. As Christians, we turn to God in times of fear and uncertainty as we do in times of joy and celebration. Please join us in prayer for God's heart of love, mercy, and truth to dwell in us and show us how to face the challenges posed by the coronavirus. Pray for the coronavirus to stop spreading. Almighty God, we know that everything is in Your sovereign control. We ask that You keep COVID-19 from continuing to spread. Give government officials the ability to safely handle people arriving from other countries. Preserve lives through the medical advances made over the last two years. And while it may be heartbreaking, comfort families as they decide to keep their distance from elderly or other high-risk family members. God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea. \u2014Psalm 46:1-2 (NIV) Pray for people who are sick or quarantining. Jesus, during Your ministry on Earth You showed Your power and caring by healing people of all ages and stations of life from physical, mental, and spiritual ailments. Be present now to people who need Your loving touch because of COVID-19. May they feel Your power of healing through the care of doctors and nurses. Take away the fear, anxiety, and feelings of isolation from people receiving treatment or quarantining. Give them a sense of purpose in pursuing health and protecting others from exposure to the disease. Protect their families and friends and bring peace to all who love them. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. \u2014Philippians 4:6 (NIV) Pray for protection for people at higher risk of developing the disease. Dear Lord, we lift to You our concern for people at high risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19 \u2014 the elderly and people with chronic health conditions. Protect them from the virus and be their comfort in this time of uncertainty and, for many, preventive isolation from loved ones. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. \u20141 Peter 5:7 (NIV) Pray for medical professionals, caregivers, and researchers. God, as the virus continues spreading, healthcare workers and first responders are working longer hours with fewer supplies and with more risk of contracting the coronavirus themselves. Renew their energy and sustain them on long shifts. Protect them as they work with patients. Multiply their supplies so they have the protective items needed to stay safe on the job. Inspire and invigorate the research doctors developing better tests to diagnose the virus, creating and sharing vaccines to prevent it, and identifying protocols to eliminate the disease's spread. Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. \u2014Psalm 23:4 (NIV) Pray for leaders responsible for making decisions about the pandemic. Father, we seek Your wisdom daily. Be with people making decisions that affect the lives and futures of our families, communities, countries, and the wider world. We pray that they communicate clearly, truthfully, and calmly \u2014 with each other and with the public \u2014 and that their messages are received and heeded. May truth and empathy be the touchstones of people setting policies for our protection. May the Lord answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you. \u2014Psalm 20:1 (NIV) Pray for all who are experiencing burnout, depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Holy Spirit, we ask that You guide people in their new realities and provide mental health care to those who need it. Allow struggling people to give themselves permission to find help. Prompt worn-out parents to speak words of kindness and encouragement to their children. Help children and youth find creative ways to talk with loved ones about their fears and anxieties. Be very present to those who are still isolated from life-giving community. Have mercy on me, my God, have mercy on me, for in you I take refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed. \u2014Psalm 57:1 (NIV) Pray for business owners and families facing financial uncertainty with new variants and continuing closures. Jesus, we thank You for Your faithfulness in guiding and equipping people in their jobs and how You've provided in the past. It can be scary and overwhelming not knowing how bills and obligations will be met or to not be able to provide for families. As people around the world feel financial strain during the ongoing uncertainty, bring them comfort and peace, reminding them that You are there for them. Provide for them in their times of need. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. \u2014John 14:27 (NIV) Pray for essential workers who aren't able to stay home. Lord, we are so grateful for all the people who continue to work each day so that others are able to eat, get medical care, take public transit, and more. We ask that You bless and protect them as they serve. Give them grace to handle disgruntled customers or patients during staffing or supplies shortages. Keep their bodies healthy as they unload and stock boxes of supplies, run hospitals, deliver packages, drive buses, and more. And please protect them all from contracting the coronavirus. Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. \u2014Lamentations 3:22-23 (NIV) How can I help people made more vulnerable by the coronavirus?
