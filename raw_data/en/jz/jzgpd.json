Thank you for being with me through my life's journey, and teaching me enjoy the process. To my beloved parents Charles and Darla Sutherland, thank you again for your unending love and support - your desire for further education has manifested itself in the next generation, this PhD is as much yours as it is mine. To my siblings Darcie, Kimberley, Tara, Chancz and brother -in-law - Daniel Mullin , thanks for sharing me with the world and for always being there when I needed you even though many times during the PhD I was silent. It was your love, support and prayers that carried me through to the end, and I thank you. To my extended family, church families and dear friends at home , abroad and here in Switzerland - I wish I could list all your names here but I would forgot someone, so just know that you ' know ' who you are . Thank you for your encouraging words, spontaneous visits, SMS messages, video chats and video messages - for making efforts to include me in major life events (i.e. funerals, births, birthdays and weddings) even when I was not able to be there in person. I am so grateful for all of you! What would we have done without WhatsApp group chats and GroupMe conversations? Studying abroad in Switzerland and meeting people from all over the globe at the Swiss TPH has been a true pleasu re and treasure. I am thankful for the warm atmosphere of community spirit that the Swiss TPH eludes, and also grateful for all the colleagues I have met in my unit, HSRDM (new and old) - you ROCK! To my supervisor, Fabri - I truly appreciate the opportuni ty to work on such an interesting and relevant global concern. I hope the EIC legacy continues to extend its 'roots' and bear more 'fruits' in true Swiss TPH style. I would also specifically like to thank those experts in African trypanosomiasis that made time for short meetings , impromptu coffees and lunches to share their knowledge with Jennifer Vanja . A special thank you to Steve Torr as well for your sending me the tiny target ! If 'it takes a village to raise a child ', then it takes a world to help someone complete a PhD - you all mean so much to me and I hope this thesis makes you proud of the woman I have become .

'Sleeping Sickness' , the short name for human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ), is derived from changes in the sleep -wake pattern seen in HAT patients as the presence of the trypanosoma parasite in the brain causes a slow neurological breakdown. Although major epidemics have been recorded over the past centuries, the number of cases have declined rapidly over the last decade placing HAT in the position of reaching elimination. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) set a range of targets for eradication, elimination, or control of 17 neglected tropical dise ases, but it still remains unclear how achievable many of these goals are, and what are the best ways forward. The Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) was supported to develop EICs for onchocerciasis, lymphatic f ilariasis (LF), and human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Unlike filarial parasites that respond well to preventative chemotherapy oral treatments, trypanosoma parasites involve a more complex diagnostic and treatment paradigm. For this reason, a unique approach was tak en to developing an EIC for HAT T.b. gambiense. Evidence was collected systematically to address the initial questions posed by the Ernst Str\u00fcggmann Forum \"Eradication Investment Case\" (EIC) framework . From this information, potential strategies using cur rent available tools and potential technologies were hypothesized that could be simulated through prospective modelling exercises to evaluate various outcomes . A dynamical model was also developed to simulate HAT T.b. gambiense transmission , and to foreca st the impact of current and emerging innovations on the key concerns of the EIC: elimination, costs, health impact, cost -effectiveness, and number of cases. Modelling was also done to simulate household surveys to evaluate the impact of elimination on pov erty. In addition a discrete event simulation model evaluate d the possibility of integration comparing old and new strategies , while a social justice assessment was undertaken to ascertain which strategies would lead to ethical compromises within potential elimination programs. The EIC results provide various options for stakeholders moving towards HAT elimination, but substantial funds will be required. In addition, trade -offs between cost- effectiveness, social justice and elimination targets in the next f ew decades will need to be made. Integration is feasible with new technologies and will provide more flexibility to capacity in high risk foci areas, but further exploration of this methods use within an EIC still needs to be explored. The multiple compone nts of the EIC appear suitable for MCDA and this is also a methodological option to consider for future decision making within EICs. Overall, t he EIC has proven to be a useful approach that is both technically feasible and informative for deliberations wit hin a disease under review for elimination . It is now recommended that funders use the results to move forward with elimination campaigns. Page 26 of 321 Page 27 of 321 1. Introduction 1.1 A historical overview of African trypanosomiasis African trypanosomiasis is a disease caused by the transmission of the T rypanosoma parasite by the tsetse fly from host to host . The first written account of African trypanosomiasis b egan during Antiquity where the Egyptians noticed their cattle manifestin g a disease with similar symptoms of what is described as African ani mal trypanosomiasis ('nagana') today. (Headrick 2014) Subsequently, an Arabian geographer and historian mention ed cases approximately during the 10th and 12th centuries. (Steverding 2008) The transatlantic slave trade during the 16th century presented an opportunity for the we stern world to witness the disease , as medical personnel responsible for the health of individuals purchased into slavery noticed they h ad peculiar symptoms. The first signs of neurological problems were seen at the end of the 18th century while the link to the disease to swollen lymph glands was discovered by Thomas Winterbottom (1766- 1859 ) in In 1889 -1896, post- industrial technologies in combination with colonial expansion into Africa displaced communities and a llowed for movement into areas infested with flies that were previously uninhabitable making inhabitants susceptible to a new killer - 'sleeping sickness'. (Steverding 2008; de Raadt 2015) This incited a disease outbreak from 1896 thru 1906 with such significance that colonies decided to intentionally fund scientific investigation into the disease transmission and possible treatments.(Headrick 2014) The results were a series of key discoveries in the early 1900s from European Scientists rega rding the parasite and role of the tsetse fly in transmission of the disease from host to host. At this time, the parasite was differentiat ed from those transmitted to animals ( i.e. Trypanosoma congolense, T rypanosoma vivax) and those human Trypanosoma brucei (T. b.) rhodesiense and T.b. gambiense ) A few drugs to treat the disease were identified at the beginning of the 20th century along with ideas for 'bush clearing' to prevent transmission in areas densely populated by the tsetse fly. Post -world war I (1914- 1918) (Steverding 2008) , a second major HAT epidemic began but since there was now a treatment available ; surveillance teams were able to be deployed , under the direction of Eugene Jamot (1879- 1937 ), to systematic ally identify and treat individuals for the disease.(Steverding 2008) In addition, insecticides and Page 28 of 321 DDT aerial spraying were discovered for fly eradication along with two additional drug treatments during the 1930s and 1940s. The plethora of activity near th is era for sleeping sickness was so vast that it gained international attention and was often a topic of European media . (Refe r to Figure 1 ) Although the drug treatments and insecti cides are now known to be highly toxic (Robays et al. 2007) and the military approach to forcing individuals to participate in village screening activities would now be seen as unethi cal - this combination of activities led to the rapid decline of disease by the 1960s. At this time in history, many African nations were able to develop independence from colonial rule and in turn abandoning to previous efforts to maintain disease suppression. Furthermore in the 1970s a global ban on DDT aerial spraying prevented vector control endeavours leading to the return of tsetse infestation and parasite transmission to resu rge.(Steverding 2008) Although the card agglutination trypanosomiasis test (CATT) was developed during 1978 to assist with disease staging and drug treatments were identified as potentials in 1980 and 1990, HAT control fell to the background . It was not until 1997, as case numbers began to rise again, active surveillance teams o f the colonial era were re -established through Medecin sans Frontieres (MSF) . Successful eradication of tsetse flies in Zanzibar in 1997, also gave hope to the possibility that fly eradication was possible while groups dedicated to new diagnostics and treatments (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics n.d.; Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) 2014b) were launched in 2006 demonstrating a new interest for the disease that had not been seen since the earlier 20th century.

Historical overview of African trypanosomiasis (historical points summarized from Steverding Page 30 of 321 1.2 A current synopsis of human African trypanosomiasis Trypanosoma brucei gambiense as 'sleeping sickness'. African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) which is at times referred to as ' nagana ' is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) rhodesiense, T.b. 1983) Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense can also be transmitted to humans and is an acute illness lasting 6 months before inevitable death in the absence of treatment, while the main reservoir host for T.b. gambien se are humans . The main focus of the thesis presented here will be on Trypanosoma brucei ( T.b.) gambiense hence onward since it is of primary health concern for human hosts.1 T.b. gambiense is often referred to as Gambi ense HAT or g -HAT. Figure 3. Cases of human African trypanosomiasis across the Democratic Republic of the Congo - T.b. gambiense (Simarro et al. 2010) Geographically, T.b. gambiense has been restricted to Sub -Saharan African with no overlap of rhodesiense HAT except in Uganda where both parasitic strains are found. Geographic areas 1 The expert task advisory group (TAG) that was created for the EIC grant # OPP1037660 by the BMGF decided in September 2013 that the focus for HAT elimination should be on T.b. gambiense as it proportionately affects a greater amount of humans, than T.b. rhodesiense and the current interventions are targeted to T.b. gambiense specifically Page 31 of 321 with the potential for transmission are referred to as a 'focus', and have been categorized into areas of low, moderate and high transmission .(Jose R Franco et al. 2014; World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) Currently there are over 57 million living in areas at risk of g - HAT with 63% of the at risk population c oming from the Democratic Republic of the Congo as shown in Figure 3. (Jose R Franco et al. 2014) Much of what is known about HAT still arises from the early discoveries at the beginning of the 20th century previously described. The family o f Trypanosoma that affects homosapiens was found by the Scottish pathologist, David Brucei and hence the 'subgenus' name of brucei is attached to such Trypanosoma. The trypanosomes come from the family of unicellular parasites with single flagella. The par asite has one large mitochondria and is surrounded with an outer coat of variant surface glycoproteins (VSG ) that can change repeatedly to evade attacks of human antibodies the human body. (Brun et al. 2010) Although the body responds with specific antigens to fight of Tr ypanosoma infection, researchers still struggle to understand which antigens are most important with the continually morphology of the VSG coat. This has led to delays in technologies for diagnostics as the sensitivity for detecting the correct antigen are difficult. (Sutherland 2016) Potential treatments that counteract the parasite usually act on 'paralyzing' the trypanosomes and arrest the proliferation of cells wh ich is a similar property of cancer cells - hence chemotherapy approaches have proven to be successful treatments for Gambiense HAT. (Swiss TPH 2015) It is known that the tsetse fly of the genus G lossina is the primary vector living near streams in foci of woodland savannah and riverine forests , with G. palpalis palpalis, G.p. gambiensis and G. fuscipe s being the three main vectors for Gambiense HAT transmission. (Jose R Franco et al. 2014) Their life cycle unlike other insects is more similar to mammals as female flies only mate once and has one larva in her lifetime. For this reason, fly eradication is seen as feasible as vector control methods interrupt the life cycle with ease. (Swiss TPH 2015) Prevention for disease transmission can be taken against the vectors through targets, sterile insect technique (SIT), aerial spraying; insecticides poured over cattle however for the most part have b een restricted to uses of AAT .(Keating et al. 2015) As outlined in Figure 4, the tsetse fly is not simply a mechanical vector of transmission but plays a role in the cyclical transmission of the parasite. The fly ingests the parasite from an Page 32 of 321 infected individual from its salivary glands which undergo transformation in its midgut and are then return to the salivary glands to transmit to another host. Within host, the trypanosomes enter the blood stream and over time progress to the blood lymph and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Although traditionally the main routes of transmi ssion are confirmed through the fly and host interactions, recent reviews postulate there may be alternative routes of transmission . These include congenital transmission from mother to child, infection via blood transfusions or organ transplants, and one historically documented incidence through sexual transmission. (Lindner & Priotto 2010; Jose R Franco et al. 2014) There are also cases throughout history of asymptomatic carriers with case reports of individuals presenting with disease mor e than 10 years after infection.(De Silva & Sumarto 2014; Sudarshi & Brown 2015; Bucheton et al. 2011) Human hosts for Gamb iense HAT are indisputably the main reservoir, but evidence of trypanosomes in pigs and dogs show that there could be potential animal hosts that serve as reservoirs .(Bucheton et al. 2011) Figure 4. Life cycle of human African trypanosomiasis Lifecycle of the African trypanosome , (Kennedy 2013) The presence of the trypanosome in the blood represents only the first stage of disease which presents itself with mild symptoms of fever, headache , pruritus, lymphadenopathy and at times hepatosplenomegaly (Brun et al. 2010) . Stage 2 of the disease occurs on ce the parasite has passed the blood -brain barrier and occurs in ap proximately 18 months without intervention. The symptoms here are sleep disturbances (hence the colloquial name 'sleeping sickness') and psychiatric manifestations which may be misdiagnosed as mental illness . (Brun et al. 2010) Page 33 of 321 As previously described, active case dete ction by Eugen Jamot began in 1926 (Refer to Figure 5A) and the mechanism to identify patients in their villages then is still used today (Refer to Figure 5B) \"Passive surveillance\" refers to the healthcare system where patients self -report to local facilities (refer to Figure 5C) however this is usually once symptoms have progressed to stage 2 as the mildness of earlier symptoms from stage 1 are often misdiagnosed as other febrile related illness. Risk factors in rural areas generally are related to interacti ons by river s, in combination with farming or work related activities in tsetse infested areas. (Jose R Franco et al. 2014) There are also ris k factors in areas with water supply in peri -urban settings.(Bilonda Mpiana et al. 2015; Jose R Franco et al. 2014) Figure 5.

Based on the historical evidence, HAT has now repositioned itself near elimination that was once observed in the 1960s. Effor ts to eradicate infectious diseases have occurred numerous times over the past century. The most commonly remembered eradication campaigns include the malaria spraying programs in Latin America from the 1930s to 1970 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2012) as well as the successful March of Dimes campaign for poliomyelitis in the United States of America.(Global Polio Eradication Initiative n.d.; March of Dimes n.d.) Although global eradication efforts for malaria and polio continue to take economic and disease burden a ssessments into account to allow for strategic planning (Duintjer Tebbens et al. 2010; Pe nny et al. 2016) , clear analysis for many of the world's neglected diseases remain to be done. T he number of cases for HAT reported in 2015 is expected to be less than 3000 which is the lowest number of HAT cases documented to date . 2 (Sutherland 2016) But in order to move towards successful elimination without comi ng face with disease resurgence needs to be strategic. While historical ly the response to HAT interventions has been reactive, we are provided with the unique position of evaluating how to move forward with the current and potential tools in the pipeline for elimination and beyond . In 1998, Dow dle first proposed specific descriptions of what control, elimination, eradication and extinction were. (Refer to Table 1 ) The n WHO brought to light many abandoned diseases (NTDs) in 2011 and provided a r oadmap to elimination (WHO 2012) as a guide to catalyse nations towards elimination measures. This initiated a global response to focus on the suggested 17 disease areas identified, that were later endorsed by the London Declaration .(London Declaration 2013) With global funders and national leaders interested in elimination, there was a need to provide comprehensive information regarding what such 2 The reader should note that the cases surveyed annual are only a proportion of all potential areas. The true number of HAT cases i s unknown and is estimated to be 3x the number of cases found (Stone et al. 2016) Page 35 of 321 campaigns would entail and more importantly the monetary requirements that would be needed . As elimination campaigns ensue, it is thought the costs begin to rise which often leaves funders with angst regarding how to prepare, ensure or secure funds for eradication and elimination campaigns.(Sutherland 2016) Hence there is a need to formally assess and anticipate approaches to eradication/ elimination in order to sustain successful campaigns of this sort. Table 1. Definitions of control, elimination, eradication and extinction Definition Control The reduction of disease incidence. prevalence ,morbidity or mortality to a Locally acceptable level as a result of deliberate effor ts; continued intervention measures are required to maintain the reduction. Example: diarrhoeal diseases. Elimination Disease Reduction to zero of the incidence of a s pecified disease in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts. Continued intervention measures are required. Example: neonatal tetanus. Infection Reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts: continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required. Example: measles, Poliomyelitis. Eradication Permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection ca used by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts: intervention measures are no longer needed. Example: smallpox. Extinction The specific infectious agent no longer exists in nature or in the laboratory Example: none. (Dowdle 1998) In 2010 the Ernst Str\u00fcngmann Forum provided a guide to developing an elimination or eradication investment case (EIC) (Tediosi et al. 2013) with a comprehensive list of open questions (refer to a ppendix A) that should be addressed if such an endeavour was to be undertaken. However, the document provided a more generic approach and did not specify which methodologies would be necessary to assess such investments or how it could be amended depending on the dis ease being evaluated. In 2012 a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)3 was provided to the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) under the direction of Dr. Fabrizio Tediosi to complete an EIC for three neglected tropical onchocerciasis (river blindness) . Both river blindness and elephanti asis have well established mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns alread y 3BMGF Grant # OPP1037660 Page 36 of 321 underway to elimination that would have to scale up in order to reach disease eradication , but the case for HAT was not so clear. As the project progressed, the approach to assessing eradication goals was deemed unfeasible hence the term 'elimination' in vestment case is taken for HAT (Sutherland 2016) . Many nation s that provide national health services (NHSs) (World Health Organization (WHO) 2015) use a health technology assessment approach to decide whether or not a new drug or intervention is worth investing in for their national budgets. Hence, at the onset of the project HTA techniques of using secondary evidence for clinical epidemiology and economic evaluation were readily adopted. It was propo sed at that time that the main analyses would use modelling to conduct a cost -effectiveness analysis, and also explore health systems modelling. However, even with these two analyses, a dditional questions regarding socio - economic outcomes, health systems strengthen ing, equity and governance would need to be resolved. Thesis objective The main objective was to address questions proposed in Ernst Str\u00fcngmann Forum for an EIC taking in considerations elements of strategies for control and elimination in relati on to: budget , cost- effectiveness , financial protection, equity , health systems and governance . Thesis outline The 1st chapter of the thesis by Steinmann et al. (Steinmann et al. 2015) describes an overview of HAT treatments, diagnostics, surveillance approaches and possible vector control tools. The 2nd chapter is a review of economic evaluations for HAT (Sutherland et al. 2015) that was undertaken to determine if there was a need to pursue a formal economic evaluation for HAT or if cost -effectiveness analysis of the current and future treatments had already been assessed. Once it was established that previous economic evaluation s had not been done in regards to control and elimination using current and future interventions, a systematic review of costs was completed in the 3rd chapter (Keating et al. 2015) to gather the necessary financial parameters that would be needed to complete such an analysis. The 4th chapter then describes a full economic evaluation of the control and elimination strategies by foci area based on the Page 37 of 321 dynamica l transmission model developed by at the Swiss TPH for the EIC project. (Chris M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) Financial costs and out-of-pocket payments will be forecasted at a global level within the 5th chapter while the 6th chapter focuses on the potential integration of the new technologies in the healthcare systems. The 7th chapter addresses ethical concerns using a normative approach develo ped in collaboration with Dr. Maria Merrit. The overall results of the assessments conducted as part of the EIC in regards to their benefits, limitations, applications and potential for further research in relation to investments for elimination are then reviewed in the final discussion.

We review current and emerging tools for Gambiense HAT control and elimination, and propose strategies that integrate the se tools with epidemiological evidence. Methods We reviewed the scientific literature to identify contemporary and emerging tools and strategies for controlling and eliminating Gambiense HAT. Through an iterative process involving key stakeholders, we th en developed comprehensive scenarios leading to elimination, considering both established and new tools for diagnosis, case treatment and vector control. Results Core components of all scenarios include detecting and treating cases with established or emerging techniques. Relatively more intensive scenarios incorporate vector control. New tools considered include tiny targets for tsetse fly control, use of rapid diagnostic tests and oral treatment with fexinidazole or oxaboroles. Scenarios consider the ti me when critical new tools are expected to become ready for deployment by national control programmes. Based on a review of the latest epidemiological data, we estimate the various interventions to cover 1,380,600 km2 and 56,986,000 people. Conclusions A number of new tools will fill critical gaps in the current armamentarium for diagnosing and treating Gambiense HAT. Deploying these tools in endemic areas will facilitate the comprehensive and sustainable control of the disease considerably, and contribute to the ultimate goal of elimination. Page 40 of 321 2.2 Introduction Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is a neglected tropical disease (NTDs) that has been earmarked by the World Health Organization (WHO) for elimination by 2020 (WHO 2012) . In 2014, WHO approved a declaration on Gambiense HAT elimination (http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/meeting_declaration_2014/en/) (Holmes 2014) and one on Rhodesiense HAT (http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/meeting_declaration_rhodesiense_2014/en/). The two disease forms are caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense, respectively. They occur in separate geographical regions, are transmitted in different ecological settings and by different Glossina (tsetse fly) species, and have different hosts and degre es of virulence(Brun et al. 2010; Malvy & Chappuis 2011) . T. b. gambiense is endemic in west and central Africa where it occurs in riverine savannah, forests and mangroves. It is an anthroponotic parasite found in a range of animals, most notably pigs, but the role of the zoonotic reservoir in human epidemi ology is still not fully understood for the different endemic settings. T. b. rhodesiense occurs mainly in savannah areas in eastern and southern Africa. It is a typical zoonotic parasite that infects mostly wild mammals and cattle, and only occasionally c rosses over to humans (Welburn et al. 2009; Funk et al. 2013) . Infections progress in two stages: haemo -lymphatic and meningo -encephalitic. T. b. gambiense is disease characterised by fever, chills , headache, pruritus, lymphadenopathy and, less commonly, hepatosplenomegaly during the first phase; and by sleep disturbances, neurologic and psychiatric disorders in the second stage. Rhodesiense HAT has a more acute course. Untreated, HAT is usually fatal. Considering the profound differences between the biology and epidemiology of Gambiense and Rhodesiense HAT, distinct strategies for their control and elimination are required (S imarro et al. 2013) . Our focus here is on Gambiense HAT, as the animal reservoir of T. b. rhodesiense includes wild animals and would require their treatment or removal of tsetse flies from all endemic areas to permanently prevent human infections. Gamb iense HAT occurs in 24 countries (Anonymous 2006) . However, cases are currently only reported from 13 countries. The total endemic area is estimated to be 1.3808 mil lion km2, with a population of 56.983 million people (Pere P Simarro et al. 2012) . A total of 7,106 cases were Page 41 of 321 reported in 2012 (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1635?lang=en). In 2001, 26,117 Gambiense HAT ca ses were reported (Simarro et al. 2013) . The estimated number of cases per year is currently about three times higher than the diagnosed number, down from a factor of 12 in 1995 (Simarro et al. 2013; Anonymous 2006; Fevre, Wissmann, et al. 2008) . In 2010, the estimated burden of HAT was 560,000 DALYs (Murray et al. 2012) , including 9,100 deaths (Lozano et al. 2012) . A comparison of total DALYs in 1990 and in 2010 suggests a reduction of 72.5% (Murray et al. 2012) . For historical, epidemiological and ecological reasons, elimination of Gambiense HAT has been deemed a feasible pursuit. Following epidemic outbreaks in the early 1900s, extensive and strictly enforced parasitological screening an d treatment of populations came close to reducing the number of yearly reported cases to zero (Simarro et al. 2008) , although many cases may have gone undiagnosed. Following a resurgence in the 1990's, cases are again on the decline and control is aided by a renewed focus on th e disease and by a number of improvements in diagnostics and treatments (reviewed below) that have helped to reduce the rate of underreporting. Gambiense HAT appears to be an anthroponotic disease, so treating the human population alone should reduce R c, the reproduction number of the disease in the presence of control, to less than one. However, epidemiological and ecological questions remain. Consequently, there is uncertainty about how best to maximise the effectiveness of available tools and about the b est way forward as new diagnostics, treatments and vector control options become available. In resource -constrained settings, optimising approaches while accounting for the various sources of uncertainty is an important but challenging task. Here, we synth esise our findings from a literature review and from consultations with experts on currently available and emerging tools. Based on these findings, we propose different scenarios for combining and deploying them, and discuss how these tools may change the landscape of HAT control. These scenarios will be used to develop models examining the financial, operational and technical feasibility of HAT elimination and eradication. Results will be communicated in a subsequent report. Page 42 of 321 2.3 Methods This work is part of an Eradication Investment Case (EIC) for HAT. An integral part of developing EICs is developing scenarios that can then be compared. We followed the general principles for scenario development outlined by Tediosi et al (Tediosi et al. 2013) . The process started with a survey of peer -reviewed scientific literature and relevant grey literature, including official WHO statistics about the epidemiology of Gambiense HAT over the last century, with a focus on the contemporary situation and fluctuations in response to targeted interventions. The same sources w ere consulted to review current activities for controlling the disease. The review was complemented by a survey of national HAT control programme managers to identify commonly used tools and strategies along with their coverage and effectiveness. In a next step, information was collected on Gambiense HAT control tools under development, their predicted effectiveness and the proposed strategies for their deployment. Lastly, data from the literature review was corroborated and complemented by key informant interviews with representatives from academia and from relevant institutions such as the WHO, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), and the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). The information was used to develop preliminary scenarios describing possible control and elimination strategies. In an iterative process, these draft scenarios were circulated widely among the constituents mentioned above and improved based on their feedback. Three periods were defined based on the time during which important tools currently under development are expected to be available for deployment by national Gambiense HAT control programmes: 2013 - 2015, 2016 - 2018 and 2019 onwa rds. A baseline scenario (2013 - 2015) was identified, considering the current standard tools for diagnosing and treating Gambiense HAT and contemporary strategies for deploying them in endemic countries. An elimination scenario I (2013 - 2015) was also de veloped to include vector control with standard methods. Alternative scenarios were prepared considering the key diagnostics, drugs and vector control tools currently being brought to market or in the later stages of development, and their respective targe t dates for mass deployment. The less ambitious scenarios (elimination III for 2016 - 2018 and elimination V and VII for 2019 onwards) served as counterfactual conditions Page 43 of 321 against which to compare one or more other scenarios for the respective period, in te rms of cost and benefits. To construct standardised scenarios that consider key differences between the epidemiology and ecology of endemic areas, foci were stratified by intensity of transmission as suggested by the WHO (Simarro et al. 2013) . The following WHO goals and definitions were incorporated: elimination in 80% of all endemic foci by 2015 and global elimination by 2020 (WHO 2012) , with the latter goal defined as (i) <1 case/10,000 people/yea r in at least 90% of all endemic foci; and (ii) <2000 new cases annually (Maurice 2013; World Health Organization (WHO) 2013b) . After 2020, efforts should be mad e to ultimately reduce incidence to 0 by 2030 (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013b) . 2.4 Results: Tools for HAT control Evolution of HAT control principles Historically, sleeping sickness went through several cycles of epidemic, intensive control in response to high numbers of fatalities, tapering off of the epidemic, and neglect (Courtin, Jamonneau, Duvallet, Garcia, Steverding 2008) . Early efforts focused on vector control through bush clearing (predominant in English colonies) (Solano et al. 2013) , chemoprophylaxis (predominant in French colonies) and mobile teams for active case finding and treatment. The latter still constitutes the mainstay of efforts to control T. b. gambiense (Brun et al. 2010) . History suggests that any new attempt to eliminate the dis ease will only succeed if commitment is sustained through appropriate investments, efficacious tools and approaches, effective deployment, and programme adaptations to local conditions (Welburn et al. 2009) . Theoretically, the incidence of Gambiense HAT can be reduced in two ways: (i) by reducing the parasite reservoir in humans through diagnosis and treatment of those infected, thereby minimising the chances of a feeding tsetse fly becoming infected, and (ii) by curbing transmission from the flies to humans via vector control efforts that reduce the tsetse population and/or reduced tsetse life expectancy (Simarro et al. 2013) . The optimal balance between treating humans and vector control has only been explored theoretically and without Page 44 of 321 considering costs (Artzrouni & Gouteux 2007) . At realistic rates of disease progression, the decision to add vector control to case detection and treatment should depend on the \"intrinsic contamination rate\" (a term proportional to vectorial capacity) in a focus. The intensity of transmission should inform the design of locally -adapted and effective interventions (Simarro et al. 2013) . The focus should be on diagnosing and treating human cases to reduce the parasite reservoir, supplemented by vector control to reduce transmission. While active and passive case detection yield excellent public health benefits, the strategy usually does no t result in the cessation of local HAT transmission as often the ones who are the most exposed (farmers, fishermen, hunters, plantation workers) (Laveissi\u00e8re et al. 2005) do not get screened. It has been estimated that when 75% of the population is screened for HAT, only 50% of the actual cases are detected. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that traditional screening approaches miss some T. b. gambiense infections among people that are either asymptomatic carriers or sero -positives; these individuals are not confirmed as infected by parasitological techniques but will ultimately develop HAT (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) (Jamonneau et al. 2012; Bucheton et al. 2011) . In the presence of the vector, these untreated carriers contribute to parasite dissemination. Under such conditions, transmission of T. b. gambiense will not be interrupted without vector control (Sol ano et al. 2013) . Vector control is recommended by the WHO in areas where case findings do not result in satisfactory incidence reductions (Simarro et al. 2013) . If vector con trol results in a reduction of animal trypanosomiasis, economic benefits often ensue, providing a powerful argument in favour of promoting \u2014 and adopting \u2014 tsetse control measures (Swallow et al. 1995) . How ever, the number of cattle is low in many Gambiense HAT foci. Low parasite concentrations in blood make HAT diagnosis complex (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) . The card agglutination te st for trypanosomiasis (CATT) was developed in the 1970s and remains the standard screening test to detect T. b. gambiense infections (Patrick Mitashi et al. 2012) . Parasitological confirmation is mandatory for treating a patient, and stage differentiation is needed to determine the treatment strategy. CATT performance is generally good, with 87 - 98% sensitivity and 93 -95% specificity (Malvy & Chappuis 2011) . However, the positive predictive value (PPV) is low as the disease prevalence is usually very low. The following drugs and regimens are commonly used to treat Gambiense HAT: pentamidine (intramuscular; first stage); (NECT; eflornithin e intravenous infusion; second stage) and melarsoprol (intravenous; second line drug for second stage disease). Prompt treatment offer s good prospects for curing first stage cases and second stage cases (treated with NECT). Melarsoprol is highly toxic, causing an encephalopathic syndrome that can be fatal. In addition, high rates of treatment failure have been reported from some location s (Brun et al. 2010; Malvy & Chappuis 2011) . Case d etection, diagnostics and treatment There are two strategies for identifying Gambiense HAT cases, with the choice of strategy depending on endemicity levels (Simarro et al. 2013) : (i) passive case detection through routine health care activities, and (ii) active case detection via screen and treat campaigns by specialised mobile teams. As Gambiense HAT is a chronic disease, passive case detection is an important strategy for ident ifying cases, accounting for half of all identified cases. However, health care facilities are either absent or insufficiently equipped and staffed throughout many HAT endemic areas (Simarro et al. 2014) . In screen and treat campaigns, residents of T. b. gambiense -endemic areas are systematically tested with the CATT (Patrick Mitashi et al. 2012) . Positive results are confirmed parasitologically, followed by disease staging and in itiation of appropriate treatment in appropriately equipped health facilities. Screening campaigns are vertical interventions that can be deployed in the absence of local health care infrastructure. Campaigns typically focus on high -incidence areas for 1 -2 years, until case numbers drop to a level that no longer justifies the massive effort. Thus, passive case detection needs to be maintained simultaneously in areas covered by screen and treat campaigns. The latter tend to identify mainly stage 1 cases whil e the majority of cases identified through passive case detection are stage 2. Patients suffering from stage 2 of the disease are more likely to seek health care and receive a correct diagnosis from the health care system than those in stage 1. Epidemiologically, stage 1 cases are more significant for transmission as they are more infectious and exposed to tsetse than stage 2 cases. While diagnostic capacity to identify suspect cases must be available down to the lowest and most peripheral level of the heal th care system, confirmation and treatment capacity can be concentrated at regional or, ideally, district level (Simarro et al. 2013; Palmer et al. 2013) . Page 46 of 321 WHO suggests the following thresholds for the frequency of active case finding (Simarro et al. 2013) : (i) high -intensity transmission (1 case/1000 population and year; correspon ding to very high and high risk areas (Pere P Simarro et al. 2012) ): screening once/year; (ii) moderate - intensity transmission (1 case/10,000 population and year but <1 case/1000 population and year; corresponding t o moderate risk areas (Pere P Simarro et al. 2012) ): screening once every two years; (iii) low- intensity transmission (<1 case/10,000 population and year; corresponding to low and very low risk areas (Pere P Simarro et al. 2012) ): no active case finding. It is impossible to repeatedly screen the entire human population due to avoidance (resulting from fear of stigma) and costs (Robays et al. 2007; Hasker et al. 2011) . Other problems include indifferenc e to repeated testing and waning interest in the face of declining local incidence, population mobility, poor access (logistics, social and political fragility) and the high costs of vertical screen and treat campaigns. There are also sero -positive individ uals who are parasitologically negative and therefore not treated (Jamonneau et al. 2012; Kagbadouno et al. 2012) , while some identified cases may refuse treatment. All of these factors pose challenges to eliminating the parasite from the human reservoir. Vector control The fr agile biological cycle of T. b. gambiense , including the low reproductive capacity of the tsetse fly and the low proportion of infected tsetse (Brun et al. 2010; Malvy & Chappuis 2011) , indicates that transmission breaks down with reduced tsetse population density. In west African savannahs, transmission no longer exists despite the continuous presence of tsetse; yet transmission had been intense in the 1930s - 40s (Courtin, Jamonneau, Duvallet, Camara, et al. 2008) . Of note, the cessation of transmission in these areas cannot be linked to deliberate tsetse control activities. A variety of tools for tsetse control are available in Gambiense HAT endemic areas, most notably traps and insecticide -treated targets. Targets \u2014 essentially simplified traps \u2014 are assumed to be more efficient for vector control than traps. While large targets are optimal for savannah tsetse (Morsitans group), multiple smaller targets have been shown to be more effective than fewer, larger ones for riverine tsetse (Palpalis group) (Esterhuizen et al. 2011) . The exact colour of the targets is also important (Lindh et al. 2012) . Targets are well accepted by local people but questions regarding the sustainability of deployment remain . The Page 47 of 321 environmental impact of vector control using traps and targets is considered to be acceptable, even within national parks (Esterhuizen et al. 2011) . Pyrethroids (e.g. deltamethrin) are used to spray tsetse resting and breeding sites. Aerial spraying of tsetse habitats is less relevant for T. b. gambiense , which is primarily found in forested areas nowadays. To be successful, the scale of control operations focusing on T. b. gambiense depends on the size of the focus (generally <500 km2) and must aim to reduce tsetse populations by 70% - >95% (Ian Hastings, personal communication ) for 5 - 6 years (e.g. by implementing fly control at a level that results in a daily death rate of 2 - 4% (Artzrouni & Gouteux 2007) ), after which time local T. b. gambiense transmission is assumed to have ceased, particularly if initial screen and treat efforts have reduced the parasite reservoir in the human population. The sterile insect techni que (SIT; the release of sterile males) is not well suited to eliminate Gambiense HAT from its typically small -scale foci where tsetse constantly immigrate from surrounding, non -HAT -endemic areas. Technical, financial and operational issues also limit mass deployment of SIT (Torr et al. 2005) . Tools currently under development A number of new tools are currently b eing developed to diagnose and treat HAT and to control tsetse. Novel diagnostic tools and drugs promise to make diagnosis easier and more sensitive and to make treatment safer. Tiny targets for tsetse promise monetary savings and easier deployment compare d to current standard traps and targets (Box 1). Figure 6 summarises the current development status of a number of diagnostic tools and drugs that are potentially relevant for HAT control and elimination. The year in which new technologies become av ailable is uncertain. In general, the development and release of diagnostic tests is faster than that of novel drugs. The delay between the availability of a new tool and its adoption and use in national Gambiense HAT control programmes is similarly uncert ain but experience with NECT suggests that transition times can be fairly short(P P Simarro et al. 2012) . However, it must be noted that the introduction of a new molecule might need mor e time than the switch to other known molecules, as was the case for NECT. Page 48 of 321 Box 1. The first generation RDTs using native antigens, now produced by Standard Diagnostics (SD) and Coris, are an alternative to CATT. Owing to their product specifications, t hey can be used both for individual screening in health centres and for mass screening of the population. They require minimal infrastructure and medical training. As in the case of positive CATT result s, parasitological confirmation of positive cases is r equired prior to the start of treatment due to their insufficient specificity (resulting in a low positive predictive value, given the low prevalence of infections) and due to the cost and complexity of current treatments. The second generation tests using recombinant antigens promise the following benefits: (i) easier and cheaper production compared to first generation tests; and (ii) detection of both T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense (CATT only works for T. b. gambiense). The mAECT, LED fluorescence microscopy and LAMP improve the sensitivity of parasitological diagnosis (confirmation of T. b. gambiense infection) in CSF (mAECT) and blood (LED fluorescence microscope and LAMP). LAMP facilitates DNA detection in both fresh and dry blood, making it pos sible to centrally test samples collected in locations without suitable laboratory infrastructure. Current development efforts for these tools focus on technology transfer, reducing costs and demonstrating the suitability of the methods for HAT endemic set tings. The current approach for disease staging involves a lumbar puncture to obtain CSF, followed by its examination (with or without prior concentration) to determine the presence or absence of parasites and a white blood cell count. An RDT for HAT staging and monitoring treatment progress based on CSF biomarkers would improve the suitability of the test for resource - constrained settings and likely its sensitivity. If such an RDT were based on blood biomarkers instead of CSF biomarkers, it would remove t he need for lumbar puncture, again greatly improving its appeal to patients (pain) and health care professionals (ease of handling, need for specialised training). Two compounds are currently undergoing clinical tests: fexinidazole and an oxaborole. Fexin idazole is being developed as an alternative to NECT for the treatment of stage 2 T. b. gambiense HAT. The primary outcome of the current phase II/III trial is non-inferiority of fexinidazole to NECT. There are strong indications that fexinidazole could al so be used to treat stage 1 T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense (both stages). Fexinidazole offers the following advantages: (i) superior safety profile compared to that of NECT and other drugs that it could potentially replace; (ii) easier administratio n than NECT (fexinidazole: one oral dose per day for 10 days; NECT: nifurtimox: three oral doses per day for 10 days plus eflornithine: 2x2 h intravenous infusio ns per day for seven days); (iii) long shelf life under tropical climate conditions; (iv) simpl ified logistics (NECT: four full treatments: 36 kg of 37.5 dm3); (v) reduced costs in terms of production (currently used drugs are donated rather than purchased by endemic countries), logistics, storage, administration, side effect management, etc.; (vi) better acceptance by patients. Together, these benefits would enable treatment provision at more peripheral levels of the health care system, facilitating access to treatment in rural settings. From the patient's perspective, treatment with fexinidazole is more attractive due to easier administration and a favourable side effect profile, potentially reducing no -show rates after diagnosis and drop - out rates during treatment. Using similar fexinidazole regimens to treat stage 1 and 2 T. b. gambiense HAT woul d eliminate the need for staging. Combined with a sensitive test for confirmatory parasitological diagnosis in blood, it would remove the need for lumbar puncture. This could also reduce drop -out/no- show rates of HAT suspects identified with rapid screenin g tests. The oxaborole SCYX -7158 has some advantages over fexinidazole, namely a single oral dose as opposed to 10 daily oral doses and protection against re -infection for a limited period due to the high level of active compound retained in the body over an extended period of time (at least two months). Some of the assumed advantages of both drugs still need to be confirmed in the on-going and upcoming clinical trials. The combination of a highly sensitive screening tool (i.e. RDT) and a safe (i.e. few an d only trivial - moderate side effects), relatively cheap and easily administered (i.e. oral) drug (ideally single dose) for both stage 1 and 2 of both T. b. gambiens e and T. b. rhodesiense could justify the unintentional treatment of a certain number of f alse-positive cases (note: a screening test needs to maximise sensitivity at the cost of specificity), altogether removing the need for confirmation of infections, staging and treatment progress monitoring. Page 49 of 321 Figure 6. Current de velopmental status of selected new tools for the diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of HAT that are relevant for its control and elimination (Source: DNDi and FIND) FIND has recently summarised advances in the development of rapid screening tests for T. b. gambiense, including tests to confirm the disease, to determine disease stage and to monitor treatment progress (FIND 2013) . Other tests are also being developed (B\u00fcscher et al. 2014; B\u00fcscher et al. 2013) , including syndromic algorithms (Palmer et al. 2013) . The Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium has recently developed two rapid diagnostic test formats, a dipstick and a lateral flow device, the latter of which has be en commercialised by Coris (B\u00fcscher et al. 2014; B\u00fcscher et al. 2013) . A first generation lateral flow rapid diagnostic test (RDT) using native trypanosome antigens is commercially available (SD Bioline HAT) and used in Uganda and other countries. In our scenarios, we expect universal adoption of RDTs by 2016. The SD tests are individually packed and stable at 40\u00b0C for 25 months. The test substrate is whole blood from a finger prick and no additional infrastructure is required to run the test. The Coris test has comparable characteristics. A second generation RDT is under development and is based on re combinant antigens and designed to detect both T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense (for which currently no serological tests exist). We expect it to be available Page 50 of 321 in 2019. Considering the limited positive predictive value of serological tests in low -preva lence settings, parasitological tools remain important. The production of the mini -anion exchange centrifugation technique (mAECT), an established technique for parasitological confirmation of HAT infections in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), has been successfu lly transferred to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Further parasitological confirmation tests to detect parasites in blood based on a light- emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscope or loop - mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP) are bei ng evaluated. These methods promise cost savings and higher diagnostic sensitivity than conventional methods. An RDT for disease staging and for monitoring treatment progress based on molecules (namely, neopterin or CXCL13) in the CSF is being developed, t hough its use may be limited if new drugs come to market that can safely and efficiently treat both disease stages. The possibility of exploiting blood biomarkers is also being explored. With regard to drugs, the nitroimidazole compound fexinidazole (Torreele et al. 2010; Brun et al. 2011; Maser et al. 2012) is currently undergoing phase II/III trials for treating Gambiense HAT stage 2 disease and is scheduled to be submitted for registration in late 2015 (approval expected in 2016). Originally, fexinidazole was intended to first replace nifurtimox - eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) for treating stage 2 T. b. gambiense HAT and later, in a second step in 2019, stage 1 T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense HAT. Efforts are now underway to amend the protocol of the current trial to allow simultaneous registration for treating stage 1 and stage 2 Gambiense HAT. Administration of the drug is oral, with one daily dose for 10 days. The benzoxaborole SCYX -7158 is another drug candidate currently under development. It is well absorbed upon oral administration and is designed as a single dose application to cure both stage 1 and stage 2 forms of T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense (Maser et al. 2012; Jacobs et al. 2011) . The drug is only slowly metabolized and eliminated from the body, and is expected to confer prote ction against re -infection for at least two months post- treatment. The drug is currently undergoing phase I clinical trials and we expect it to be commercially available by 2019. Mini targets of reduced size (Esterhuizen et al. 2011) and higher attractiveness to tsetse flies (Lindh et al. 2012; Rayaisse et al. 2010) compared to standard ones promise considerable cost effectiveness gains as they are more effective, require less material per killed tsetse, and are Page 51 of 321 easier and thus cheaper to deploy (Solano et al. 2013) . They are already available for deployment. 2.5 Results: Scenarios for HAT control Proposed scenarios for controlling and eliminating Gamb iense HAT A total of nine scenarios were developed based on the overview of current and emerging tools for diagnosing and treating Gambiense HAT and for killing tsetse flies. Each scenario describes interventions for case identification, diagnostics, treatment and vector control to be implemented in the given period ( Figure 7). Figure 7. Summary of scenarios for control and elimination of Gambiense HAT The baseline scenarios for each period rely on case detection for identifying infected individuals and for determining their treatment, i.e. a reduction of the parasite reservoir in humans. Diagnosis and treatment approaches evolve as new technologies become available. Page 52 of 321 Suggested intervals for active case finding (screening) campaigns depend on the current transmission intensity (once a year in high -intensity transmission areas, every two years in moderate -intensity transmissio n areas) while passive case detection must be available throughout the endemic area. Active screening is implemented until incidence reaches the low-transmission threshold (<1 case/10,000 population per year). In the period 2013 - 2015, diagnosis and treat ment follow current standard approaches: truck -based mobile teams use CATT for screening, parasitological confirmation of infection is based on the visualization of parasites, lymph node aspirate or CSF is obtained by lumbar puncture, staging is based on CSF examination (criteria for stage 2: detection of parasites or >5 white blood cells/mm3), treatment is with pentamidine for stage 1 disease and NECT for stage 2, and treated patients are followed to detect relapses and to verify treatment success. Change s for the period 2016 - 2018 include the introduction of RDTs (first generation) for screening by mobile teams relying on motorbikes instead of trucks, and the introduction of fexinidazole to treat stage 2 patients. Parasitological confirmation and staging remain important and are performed either by truck -based teams or in health facilities. From 2019 onwards, option 1 assumes that staging (and hence, obligatory lumbar puncture) is not required anymore as fexinidazole is used to treat both stage 1 and stag e 2 of the disease. In option 2, a switch to second generation RDTs and the introduction of oxaboroles for treatment mean that neither confirmation nor staging of infections are required any longer, and that treated individuals are protected against re -infection for a certain period. To accelerate Gambiense HAT elimination, vector control is proposed for high -transmission foci or even across all areas with active transmission, along with screen and treat and passive case detection, as appropriate. The cheap est and most effective vector control tools available are proposed, i.e. baited and insecticide -treated targets, deployed at a density of 20/linear km or ~10/km2 for palpalis group tsetse in riverine foci. Depending on local conditions, modifications may u ltimately be required along these lines: (i) foci with high cattle/livestock density: insecticide treatment of livestock; (ii) foci: targets at higher density; (iii) mangrove foci: ground/boat -based spraying (in addition to targets if the latter can be deployed at all). Elimination scenario I for 2013 - 2015 can be summarised as follows: standard targets are used for vector control in addition to the diagnostic and treatment algorithms established Page 53 of 321 for the Gambiense HAT control scenario for the same p eriod. In elimination scenario II for 2013 - 2015, tiny targets replace the standard targets for vector control. Elimination scenario IV for 2016 - 2018 and elimination scenarios VI and VIII for 2019 onwards resemble the control scenarios for the respectiv e periods with the addition of tiny targets for vector control. Target areas and target population for Gambiense HAT control and elimination The basic Gambiense HAT control and elimination scenarios III, V and VII cover all areas and populations at very h igh to moderate risk according to Simarro et al. (Pere P Simarro et al. 2012) , translating into a an area of 693,600 km2 inhabited by 19,596,000 people in 13 countries (Table 2). Among them, three countries (Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone) had no functional national HAT programme at the time of the last comprehensive review (Anonymous 2006) . Meanwhile , Cameroon and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire have been able to re -establish their respective programmes. The population at risk in Sierra Leone is 1,000 people on <100 km2. A comprehensive Gambiense HAT elimination programme would need to cover all potential transmission areas. This translates into an area of 1,380,600 km2, inhabited by 56,986,000 people in 14 countries ( Table 2). The population at risk in countries without a functional control programme (Anonymous 2006) is 171,000 people on 1,800 km2 in Sierra Leone and 2,182,000 people on 71,000 km2 in Nigeria. Compared to the base scenarios, interventions with the aim of accelerated Gambiense HAT elimination would need to cover twice the area at risk (an expansion from 693,600 km2 to 1,380,600 km2) and 2.9 times more people (an expansion from 19,596,000 individuals to 56,986,000 individuals).Page 54 of 321 Table 2.

Page 55 of 321 2.6 Discussion Eliminating Gambiense HAT is a declared goal of WHO (WHO 2012) . However, the most effective st rategy for reaching this outcome is not yet clear. Elimination, defined as the sustained cessation of transmission of a pathogen in a defined geographic area as a result of human activities, can be achieved by ensuring that R c, is below 1 for a sufficient amount of time. This can be achieved either by reducing the force of infection on humans through vector control or by reducing the force of infection on vectors by treating infective humans. As has been pointed out for malaria elimination (Moonen et al. 2010) , sustaining the status of elimination requires either: i) eliminati ng the vector in addition to the pathogen; ii) preventing re-introduction from neighbouring areas that may not (effectively) be pursuing elimination through border screening; or iii) coordinating and implementing an effective elimination campaign in all en demic areas. Although elimination of tsetse may be easier to achieve than that of mosquito species (e.g. (Vrey sen et al. 2000) ), many areas, particularly riverine ones, may be prone to reinvasion due to the dispersal behaviour of tsetse (Rogers & Randolph 2002) . Likewise, border screening for HAT i s complicated by test system specifications, movements related to armed conflict and the occurrence of the disease in remote, often inaccessible or poorly served locations. Thus, in the absence of eradication, most HAT endemic countries will need to mainta in post -elimination surveillance and response systems to prevent reestablishment via migrant cases. What is unknown is whether post -elimination surveillance can rely on the currently established passive case detection or whether more intense, active survei llance will be required and should the approach differ between areas with varying basic reproduction numbers (receptivity). Although Gambiense HAT elimination has been deemed achievable, several challenges and uncertainties remain, such as gaining access for sufficient periods of time to areas that are currently experiencing political upheaval or strife (Simarro et al. 2013) or are otherwise inaccessible, as well as uncertainty r egarding the extent to which these areas serve as sources of reinfection to nearby foci. Similarly, although case underreporting has greatly decreased over the past two decades, the latest estimates still assume a factor of three (Simarro et al. 2011) . The spatial distribution of these unrecognised cases could affect elimination campaigns Page 56 of 321 if they represent previously unknown pockets of transmission. Other sources of reinfection relate t o uncertainty regarding the true case fatality rate (Jamonneau et al. 2012; Checchi et al. 2008) , the frequency of non- fatal infections and the extent to which trypanotolerant individuals contribute to transmission, if at all. Similar u ncertainty exists regarding the existence and importance of non -human animal reservoirs for T. b. gambiense . Based on investigations using mathematical models of pathogen transmission, several authors have posited that since the contribution of humans to t he basic reproduction number of HAT is below one, a contribution from a non -human reservoir is probable (Funk et al. 2013; Rogers 1988) . Others have argued that the contribution of animal reservoirs is likely negligible (Simarro et al. 2013) . Resolving this debate is currently a priority as the existence of non -human reservoirs would necessitate a change in strategy or even affect the prospects of elimination. We presen t options for achieving Gambiense HAT elimination that include both established and novel tools and that are considered relevant by a large panel of experts. These scenarios are simplified representations of the true efforts needed to eliminate the disease and it is likely that a combination of strategies will be needed to account for local realities. The inclusion of tools currently under development increases the uncertainty that the scenarios can one day be applied as described but most agree that only t he advent of critically needed drugs and diagnostic tools will allow for Gambiense HAT elimination (Brun et al. 2010) . The location and extent of traditional Gambiense HAT foci has been mapped over recent years and is now well established in most countries (Pere P Simarro et al. 2012; Simarro et al. 201 0). Thus, mapping requirements for planning Gambiense HAT elimination are minimal. Another critical issue for any elimination programme is the sustainability of efforts needed until the last case has been treated and recurrence of the infection can be r uled out with a high degree of confidence. Surveillance and active response systems will become increasingly important as case numbers decline and the focus shifts from standardised approaches to tailored solutions adapted to the realities of the remaining pockets of transmission. Gambiense HAT arguably is already close to such a situation, with transmission mostly restricted to remote and under -served communities. Page 57 of 321 Any effort to eliminate Gambiense HAT must ensure that capacity for passive case detection and appropriate treatment of identified cases can reach the required levels across the entire focus. Following the cessation of local Gambiense HAT transmission, robust and effective surveillance coupled with an active rapid response mechanism to any new cases is required until transmission also ceases in neighbouring foci. Surveillance thus needs to be established throughout the focus and maintained for several years after the last case has been detected (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013b) . Projecting the effectiveness and costs of such an active surveillance -response system is challenging as little experien ce exists to guide such efforts, not only in the field of Gambiense HAT but also for other diseases (Kelly et al. 2013) . Other important research questions are: What is the likelihood that the stated goal will be achieved when a given scenario is implemented over a certain time and how long would it take to achieve the intended outcome? What is the overall cost of implementing the scenarios and what are the public health and health service implications? For established methods, experience with control programmes can provide insights into these questi ons for specific localities. For instance, an intense period of twice -yearly population screening using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and treatment of serological cases resulted in a remarkable decline of prevalence from 1.42% to 0.03% over the course of six years in the Luba focus of Bioko Island. Less frequent screening of the population was maintained for the following 14 years until the focus was considered inactive (Simarro et al. 2006) . Such insights clearly have value for policy makers but it is debatable whether these experiences can be extra polated to other foci with different characteristics. For example, Luba is located on an island and would therefore be less prone to immigration of either infected flies or humans; it also had an excellent level of participation and acceptance of screening and treatment. Such extrapolation is necessary, however, and will also have to include predictions about the duration of interventions and the likelihood of reaching elimination. By considering (multiple) technologies that are currently under development, we increased the uncertainty of the expected outcomes; some tools may not ultimately become available or only become available later than anticipated. Additionally, new tools may lead to more than increased efficacy or decreased costs; they could also pot entially allow for strategic changes. Page 58 of 321 Here, we have given an overview of nine distinct strategies that reflect not only the currently available tools at our disposal but also highlight novel strategies according to their projected release dates and specul ate on their relevance for Gambiense HAT elimination. The multitude of options available and the low number of cases precludes conducting controlled trials for all of these scenarios. Finding the optimal scenario for a given endemic setting should therefor e be informed by theoretical work. A possible framework for guiding such decisions is given by benefit -cost and cost -effectiveness analyses, based on appropriate costing and dynamic transmission models and on an understanding of the wider societal implications of HAT elimination. Our scenarios can form the basis for modelling feasibility and the health and economic impacts of Gambiense HAT elimination (Tediosi et al. 2013) , providing valuable information to a wide range of actors working on HAT control, research and development. The advent of powerful tools to detect and treat HAT cases and control tsetse flies at a time of unprecedented political commitment and financial investments in NTD control offers a unique opportunity to eliminate the disease. The rigorous implementation of trials to test the ef ficacy of novel tools will already go some way towards contributing to the local Gambiense HAT elimination, since they require an appropriate number of patients, the provision of quality care and the establishment of infrastructure, all of which will have a lasting impact on the local epidemiology in the few remaining foci where an appropriate number of new cases occur. 2.7 Acknowledgements We are grateful for the comments and input of many people received when discussing draft scenarios and different versions of this manuscript: The members of the Technical Advisory Group of the project Eradication Investment Cases (EIC) for Onchocerciasis, Lymphatic Filariasis and Human African Trypanosomiasis, especially Ian Hastings, Mike J.

It is transmitted to humans vi a the tsetse fly. Approximately 70 million people worldwide were at risk of infection in 1995, and approximately 20,000 people across Africa are infected with HAT. The objective of this review was to identify existing economic evaluations in order to sum marise cost -effective interventions to reduce, control, or eliminate the burden of HAT. The studies included in the review were compared and critically appraised in order to determine if there were existing standardised methods that could be used for econo mic evaluation of HAT interventions or if innovative methodological approaches are warranted. A search strategy was developed using keywords and was implemented in January 2014 in several databases. The search returned a total of 2,283 articles. After two levels of screening, a total of seven economic evaluations were included and underwent critical appraisal using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Methodology Checklist 6: Economic Evaluations. Results from the existing studies focuse d on the cost -effectiveness of interventions for the control and reduction of disease transmission. Modelling was a common method to forecast long- term results, and publications focused on interventions by category, such as case detection, diagnostics, dru g treatments, and vector control. Most interventions were considered cost -effective based on the thresholds described; however, the current treatment, nifurtomix -eflornithine combination therapy (NECT), has not been evaluated for cost- effectiveness, and co nsiderations for cost - effective strategies for elimination have yet to be completed. Overall, the current evidence highlights the main components that play a role in control; however, economic evaluations of HAT elimination strategies are needed to assist national decision makers, stakeholders, and key funders. These analyses would be of use, as HAT is currently being prioritized as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) to reach elimination by 2020. Page 62 of 321 3.2 Background Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a disease caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or T. b. rhodesiense and is transmitted to humans via the tsetse fly. Approximately 70 million people worldwide were at risk of infection in 1995 (WHO n.d.) , and although 7,216 cases were reported in 2012 (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) , it is estimated that approximately 20,000 people across Africa are infected with HAT (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) . According to the Global Burden of Disease, recent estimates of years lived with disability (YLDs) for HAT annually range from 2,000 to 25,000 (Vos et al. 2012) . There are approximately 30 African countries affected by this disease, and it has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) (WHO 2013) . WHO describes the disease as a neurological breakdown that is caused by the trypanosome parasite in the b rain, which eventually leads to a coma or death if a patient is not treated (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) . Patients are identified by self -reporting to health care centres (referred to as \"passive case detection\"), while active screening by trained professionals in mobile teams continues in high - and moderate -transmission areas. Active screening campaigns are carried out in remote villages, and a series of tests are used for the diagnosis of the disease. The current diagnostic algorithms for HAT include the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT) followed by full blood assays to identify the parasite microscopically. Lumbar puncture with parasitological confirmation is then used for staging of the disease. Patients that are diagnosed with HAT are then referred to HAT treatment centres. Limited active screening is done for T. b. rhodesiense because there is no serological test available to facilitate easy identification. Henc e, most T. b. rhodesiense cases are detected by clinical signs and symptoms. The subsequent diagnostic steps are similar to T. b. gambiense in that parasite detection is done using chancre aspirate or blood, and staging of the disease again uses cerebrospi nal fluid obtained from lumbar puncture. The treatments for T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense also differ. Treatment for T. b. gambiense includes a 7 -day intramuscular injection treatment of pentamidine for patients in stage 1 of the disease that is generally well tolerated, with minor adverse events. Nifurtimox -eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) is a 14- day in -hospital chemotherapy treatment that is required for patients Page 63 of 321 suffering from stage 2 of HAT. The adverse events commonly seen in patients treated with NECT are considered to be mild to moderate in severity. For HAT T. b. rhodesiense, the treatment for stage 1 includes weekly intravenous injections of suramin over the course of 5 weeks (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) . Negative reactions to suramin coincide with the patient's health status, but overall, it is a well -tolerated treatment. Stage 2 treatment for T. b. rhodesiense is a 10- day treatment of melarsoprol. Melarsopr ol is the most toxic of the HAT treatments, leading to encephalopathic syndrome in 5% to 18% of patients treated and often resulting in death. Vector control methods for prevention of HAT T. b. rhodesiense are commonly used, as the disease is well -known to have an animal reservoir that contributes to transmission in both human and animal populations (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) . In regards to HAT T. b. gambiense , historically, vector control has not been suggested. However, evidence of an animal reservoir for T. b. gambiense has been discussed (Simo et al. 2014; Funk et al. 2013) , and vector control was recently encouraged by WHO as a n integrated strategy for HAT (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) . The year scheduled for HAT elimination is 2020 (WHO 2012) , and as this deadline approaches, research groups are currently developing new drug treatments and diagnostic tools (B\u00fcscher et al. 2014; Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) 2014b; Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics n.d.) for HAT. Additionally, experts in ve ctor control methods are also seeking interventions that would be more cost- effective and feasible for communities at risk for the disease. Even traditional teams that have gone out via trucks are now being reconsidered in combination with newer drug treat ments using motorbike teams. Although some screening programs include a component of community sensitization, community involvement within control and elimination campaigns and knowledge of how this \"disease awareness\" is translated into behavioural change s and attitudes within affected populations need to be considered. There is now a need to evaluate not only the possibility of control and elimination for HAT but also how these new interventions and approaches may contribute to the grand scheme of such en deavours. WHO has provided recommendations to improve certain factors likely to achieve elimination (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) , and decision makers have also committed to funding the elimination of the disease (London Declaration 2013) ; yet, a clear path to the Page 64 of 321 achievement of this goal is not available, nor is it clear what the most ef ficient pathway towards elimination would be. In addition, thus far there has been no synthesis of the current costs and effectiveness of all strategies that could intervene in the transmission of the disease. The objective of this review was to identify e xisting economic evaluations in order to summarise cost -effective interventions to reduce, control, or eliminate the burden of HAT. The studies included in the review were compared and critically appraised in order to determine if there were standardised m ethods that could be used for economic evaluations of HAT interventions or if innovative methodological approaches are warranted. 3.3 Methods Literature Search Strategy A literature search was conducted via the OvidSp interface on January 22, 2014 using keyw ords for HAT specific to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms required for Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and Embase databases. An economic filter developed by Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) was a lso applied. (Refer to Supporting Information S1.) The Journal Storage (JSTOR) database was also searched using the following key words: African trypanosomiasis OR trypanosom& OR \"sleeping sickness\" AND cost& AND economics. In addition, the following keyw ords were also searched in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database Health Technology Assessment (NHSEED HTA), and Cochrane databases: \"African\" AND \"Trypanosomiasis\" OR \"sleeping sickness\". All citations were downloaded into Mendeley, where duplicates were identified and removed. Literature Screening & Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Screening of the articles was done in two stages. At the first level, all titles and abstracts were screened . Articles that were considered potentially relevant were then assessed at the second level, in which the full text was read. After reading the full text, articles that still met the inclusion criteria were considered. A full description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is available in appendix B. Data were screened on both levels according to the outline of Page 65 of 321 population -intervention -comparators -outcomes -setting (PICOS) criteria, in which the population pertained to humans. Evaluations regarding strai ns of both HAT T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense were reviewed, although outcomes only pertaining to humans impacted by the disease were taken into consideration (no animal implications). Interventions (I) and comparators (C) included any intervention that could lead to prevention or reduction of disease in human populations (including vector control). The outcomes (O) that were considered for review were costs, consequences (life -years saved [LYS], disability -adjusted life years [DALYs], etc.), and the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER), while the setting (S) included any African country. For the purpose of this analysis, an economic evaluation was defined by the Drummond et al. definition of a \"full economic evaluation,\" and therefore, both costs and consequences of two or more alternatives had to be present in the analyses evaluated (Drummond et al. 2005) . In cases in which an incremental analysis was not performed, articles were not excluded. Instead, if there was sufficient information in the publication to calculate the ICER, it was calculated during the review process. If there was insufficient informat ion to calculate the ICER, it was noted in the critical appraisal that an incremental analysis was not present. No time constraints were added to the search. Quality Assessment and Critical Appraisal The quality of the included studies was assessed using the SIGN Methodology Checklist 6: Economic Evaluations Version 3.0 (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) n.d.) , which was composed of two parts. The first portion contained questions regarding the internal and external validity of the publication. Items in the sections were assessed using answers of \"Yes,\" \"No,\" or \"Can't say.\" The second portion of the checklist addressed the reviewers overall assessment of the study and also provided the reviewer with an area to judge if the article was \"unacceptable,\" \"acceptable ,\" or of \"high quality.\" Studies that received a \"Yes\" on 65% or more of the questions in Section 1 were considered acceptable to the authors. Page 66 of 321 3.4 Results Literature Search Results The NHSEED, JSTOR, MEDLINE, and Embase searches yielded a total of seven artic les, 1,000 articles, 595 articles, and 673 articles, respectively. An additional eight articles from the grey literature, reference lists, and referrals from subject matter experts were also included. There were a total of 2,283 studies found, and after the removal of duplicates, 2,095 were chosen for primary screening (title and abstracts). A total of 41 publications were then selected for full - text screening. Thirty -four studies were excluded after full -text review, and reasons for exclusion were recorde d. (Refer to Table 3) Seven full texts (Shaw 1989; Politi et al. 1995; ya, et al. 2007b; Robays et al. 2008) were included for full critical appraisal and data abstraction for analysis.

PRISMA diagram Quality Assessment and Critical Appraisal The quality scores for the seven included studies (Shaw 1989; Politi et al. 1995; Page 68 of 321 et al. 2007b; Robays et al. 2008) displayed in Table 4 (SIGN Methodology Checklist 6: Economic Evaluations) demonstrated that on average 81% (67% -89%) of the items stipulated by the SIGN checklist were addressed. Economi c theory suggests that individuals have a time preference in regards to gains, and hence, costs and outcomes in the future are less valuable than those in the present (Morris et al. 2007) . This concept is referred to as \"discounting\" and is standard methodology in economic evaluation; however, five out the seven studies in this review did not address it (Politi et al. 1995; Shaw Robays et al. 2008) . Each publication considered the cost and consequence compared to more than one intervention for HAT; ho wever, three of the publications (Shaw 1989; Cattand 2001; Lutumba, Robays, Miaka, et al. 2005a) did not include an incremental analysis to examine the marginal benefit of adopting one intervention compared to the next best option. A single study (Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) did not have a clear objective, and Shaw's study did not justify the study design or clearly describe the cost sources (Shaw 1989) . All bu t one study (Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) completed a sensitivity analysis in addition to the base results. All studies discu ssed the economic importance of the question and had outcomes that could be relevant for decision makers. Overall, all studies were judged to be \"acceptable\" for this review.

Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes *Base case analysis was not incremental, but sensitivity analysis had an incremental analysis Page 71 of 321 Characteristics of Included Economic Evaluations Each of the seven included publications had varyin g characteristics, as summarised in Table 5. The first publication of a full economic evaluation for HAT identified was completed in 1989 by Alexandra Shaw (Shaw 1989) , with the next publication coming in 1995 (Politi et al. 1995) . The remaining five publications were published from 2005 to 2008 (Lutumba, Robays, Miaka, Robays et al. 2008) . The evaluations covered four African countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Uganda, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Angola. Most (3/7) evaluations (n=3) came Robays, one study from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Shaw 1989) , one study from Uganda (Politi et al . 1995) , one study from Angola (Robays et al. 2008) , and finally one study that included an analysis from both Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Shaw & Cattand 2001) . Economic evaluations concerning HAT in human populations looked almost exclusively at the disease T. b. gambiense (71%), although in two instances the disease strain was not specified explicitly (Shaw 1989; Robays et al. 2008) . A total of four economic evaluations (Shaw 1989; Lutumba, Robays et al. 2008) were considered cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) in which the cost for a desired effect or consequence (e.g., lives saved, years of infection avoided, etc.) was measured. Two studies (Politi et al. 1995; Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) included both a CEA and cost utility analysis (CUA) in which the u tility was measured in DALYs. One study exclusively completed a CUA in which cost per DALY averted was measured as the main outcome (Shaw & Cattand 2001) . Overall, there was only one publication that was found in an \"economic\" journal, as the remaining articles were published in journals pertaining to tropical medicine and infectious diseases. Funding for the research was often not mentioned. However, WHO was referred to as a means of support in two publications (Politi et al. 1995; Lutumba, Robays, Miaka, et al. 2005b) , and support from the Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation was also mentioned (Lutumba, Robays, Miaka, et al. 2005b) .

Page 74 of 321 Interventions The majority (5/7) of the publications evaluated interventions that included case detection and diagnosis, while two of the articles evaluated treatment interventions of melarsoprol and eflornithine (difluoromethlyornithine [DFMO]) for stage 2, as the treatment for stage 1 was always considered to be pentamidine (Politi et al. 1995; Robays et Miaka, et al. 2005b; Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) looked exclusively at sensitivity and specificity of diagnosti c algorithms and staging algorithms, while one study also looked at the differences between treatment and vector control interventions in addition to case detection and diagnosis (Shaw 1989) . The study by Shaw in 1989 was the only publication that included a comparative economic analysis for vector control as an intervention to control HAT in a human population. Economic Evaluation Description Key insights regarding the details of the includ ed economic evaluations are described below and also summarised in Table 6. Methods and Software Six of the seven included studies used modelling to measure outcomes for the economic evaluation. Only one study completed an economic evaluation alongside a clinical trial. The most common form of modelling was decision tree modelling; the structure of the remaining models was not described in detail although they were all described as being implemented with spreadsheets. For decision tree models, TreeAge software (Tre eAge Software, Williamstown, Massachusetts, United States) was used for three of four studies (Lutumba, Robays, Miaka, et al. 2005b; Robays et al. 2008) , and one publication did not mention which software was used. The two spreadsheet mod els that were reviewed (Shaw 1989; Shaw & Cattand 2001) used Super -Calc 4 (Sorcim, Silicon Valley, California, US) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Washington, US) software, while the economic evaluation alongside clinic al trial (EEACT) (Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) relied on Microsoft Access (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Washington, US), Microsoft Page 75 of 321 Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Washington, US), and Epi Info 2002 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, US). Model Structure, Assumptions & Validation A visual diagram of the model was provided for five of the six studies th at included models (Politi e t al. 1995; Shaw Robays et al. 2008) . Although descriptions of the six models were available, no details of the assumptions or justification for the inputs used in the modelling were addressed in any of the included literature. None of the articles reported completing an internal validation of the models, but the authors of one article (Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) did compare their outcomes t o other literature in similar areas for external validity. Population, Setting, and Perspective In one of the modelling studies, the number of patients modelled was not mentioned, while the remaining studies included 690 to 1,000,000 hypothetical patients. The clinical trial included a total of 57 patients from 47 households (Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) . As mentioned previousl y, the populations were based on four countries (DRC, C\u00f4te D'Ivoire, Angola, and Uganda), with different settings including: rural communities, health centres, and a sleeping -sickness hospital ward. In one case (Shaw 1989) , the perspective of the analysis was not mentioned, but two articles approached the economic evaluation from a societal perspective (Politi et al. 1995; Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) , and the remaining four articles used the provider perspective (e.g., a donor or national health service) (Shaw & Cattand 2001; Robays Meheus, et al. 2007) . Additional Inputs, Outcomes, and Features of Included Economic Evaluations Data sources for the economic evaluations came from clinical trials, primary data collection from national programmes (e.g., Programme National de Lutte and National Sleep ing Sickness Programme Uganda), reports from WHO, available literature, and from speaking with experts in the arena of HAT. Prevalence values were not mentioned in two studies and ranged from 0.1% to 70% in the remaining literature. Page 76 of 321 All costs were evaluated in US dollars (USD} (Shaw 1989; Politi et al. 1995; Shaw et al. 2007b; Robays et al. 2008) except for one study by Lutumba et al. (Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) that estimated cost- effectiveness in euros. Three studies reported only one outcome, while the remaining studies reported two outcomes in terms of cost per outcome. Cost per DALY averted was reported in three studies, while cost per LYS was reported in four studies. Cost per years of life lost (YLL), cost per patient/control case det ected or patient cured, and cost per infection prevented were also examples of cost -effectiveness reported in the literature reviewed. Shaw (1989) and Shaw and Catt and reported time horizons of 20 years and one year, respectively (Shaw 1989; Shaw & Cattand 2001) . Studies that used decision tree modelling did not report time horizons as decision trees have no time -related component (Politi et Meheus, et al. 2007) . The two remaining studies did not report a discrete time horizon for the analysis (Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b; Robays et al. 2008) . Two publications reported using discount rates of 10% (Shaw 1989; Robays et al. 2008 ), while one publication reported using a discount rate of 3% (Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) . The remaining publications d id not mention any discounting (Politi et al. 1995; Shaw al. 2007) , which was probably due to the fact that decision trees were used and therefore had no time horizon that or the time span modelled was one year or less. Two of the seven articles made explicit references to willingness -to-pay (WTP) thresho lds for the cost -effectiveness of HAT as US$25/DALY (Politi et al. 1995; Shaw & Cattand 2001) . One article mentioned that the WHO - CHOICE (CHOosing Interventions that are Cost- Effective) considered the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of a count ry to be used as the WTP threshold for choosing between competing interventions (Robays et al. 2008; Evans et al. 2005) . The remaining publications Lutumba, et al. 2007; Robays et al. 2008) made no reference to a WTP threshold for the economic analysis under evaluation.Page 77 of 321 Table 6.

If melarsoprol effectiveness improved, then scenario/intervention '3' would be dominated by scen ario/intervention '2' making scenario/intervention '2' the most cost - effective option. If the effectiveness of eflornithine in late stage patients is as high in refractory patients who take melarsoprol, then '2' and '3' as potentially cost - effective options. Working days lost by were incremental. 70%, the ICER of CATT + PG compared CATT was $3,175/LYS. When the Spe of PG was 90%, the ICER of CATT + PG compared to CATT was $1,225/LYS.

Page 87 of 321 Base Case and Sensitivity Analyses A full description of the economic outcomes for each study is outline in Table 7. The results from the sensitivity analyses conducted for the included publications are provided in Table 6. A total of 5 studies (Politi et al. 1995; Lutumba, Robays et al. 2008) discussed cost- effectiveness results by calculating incremental cost -effectiveness ratios (ICERs), which are summarised in Table 6. Lutumba and colleagues published cost -effectiveness analyses of varying diagnostic algorithms for HAT (Lutumba, Robays, Miaka, et al. 2005b; Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) . Their results in 2005 demonstrated that lymph node puncture (LNP) in addition to CATT was more cost -effective ($20/LYS) to CATT tube cent rifugation were effective relative to four other diagnostic algorithms. Althou gh the strengths of these cost -effective algorithms were noted, Lutumba and colleagues noted that some of these algorithms may not be feasible to carry out in the field (Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) . In regards to treatment regim ens, Politi's analysis (Politi et al. 1995) in 1995 demonstrated that based on a WTP of US$25/DALY, melarsoprol alone (initial treatment and relapses) was cost- effective at US$8/DALY (US$209/LYS) compared to no treatment. Politi's analysis also demonstrated that a treatment pathway of melarsoprol with treatment relapses and relapses (US$167/DALY and US$4,444/LYS) would not have been considered cost -effective based on the aforementioned cost- effectiveness threshold of US$25/DALY (Politi et al. 1995) . A more recent publication by Robays demonstrated that DFMO was more cost -effective than melarsoprol (US$1,596/LYS and US$58/control case detected) when donated drug costs were not included; the analysis of cost- effectiveness was based on WHO -CHOICE's suggestion that interventions at a cost of GDP per capita are v ery cost -effective and interventions at three times GDP per capita are cost - effective (WHO n.d.) . When donated drug costs were included, Rob ays found that DFMO was more cost -effective than melarsoprol at US$8,169/LYS and US$299/control case detected. Lutumba et al. (Lut umba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) found that active screening (case detection) in Page 88 of 321 addition to treatment was more cost -effective than treatment alone at $17/DALY averted and $301/control case detected or patient cured. Two studies (Shaw 19 89; Shaw & Cattand 2001) did not report cost and effect results incrementally. Although Shaw et al. (Shaw & Cattand 2001; Shaw 1989) conducted several analyses exploring combinations of case detection, diagnostics, treatment, and vector control, outcomes were not compared incrementally; consequently, ICERs were not attained. They did calculate $/patient detected with varying prevalence for five strategies and found that lower prevalence rates were associated with higher $/DALY and higher prevalence rates with lower $/DALY; these were based on average cost- effectiveness ratios, not ICERs. All but one study included some form of one -way sensitivity analysis (OWSA). No studies completed subgroup analyses or con ducted probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA), and hence, results were not presented using cost -effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC). Additional measures of uncertainty were not explored in the form of a value of information (VOI) analysis in any o f the reviewed publications. Page 89 of 321 Table 7.

Vector control (traps/targets + ground spraying) Page 91 of 321 3.5 Discussion A review of previous evidence has demonstrated that there have been only a few economic evaluations conducted to assess the cost -effectiveness of interventions to control HAT and reduce disease burden. From this evidence alone, it would prove difficult for decision makers to strategize on which interventions would be most cost- effective for elimination; however, the results do provide some insights into the key components of HAT disease control and how these components could be translated into HAT elimination strategies, which could then be assessed through economic evaluation. Overall the strengths of this review are that it highlights the components that play a role in disease control and reduction of transmission and emphasizes that these are the components that should be incorporated into elimination strategies. Case detection, diagnosis, treatment, and vector control ar e the four categories of interventions that have been considered thus far in the literature. Strategies towards elimination should continue to consider the impact of these components but also aim to highlight their individual and collective use within a fo rmal strategy for reaching elimination. This was highlighted in the study by Lutumba et al. (Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) in which case-detection with treatment was compared to treatment alone and also in the work by Shaw and colleagues in 1989 in which essentially all four categories were evaluated with varying incidence. Within diagnostics, algorithms for CATT showed that the addition of tests led to more efficient outcomes (Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) . However, there is still a gap in cost- effectiveness knowledge of the current treatment for HAT, NECT. Global investors, partners, and academic gr oups (World Health Organization (WHO) n.d.; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation n.d.; Department for International Development n.d.; Swiss TPH 2014; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine n.d.; Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics n.d.; Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) 2014b) are now working together not only to control and treat this disease but also to develop novel diagnostic tools (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics n.d.; B\u00fcscher et al. 2014) and drug treatments (Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) 2014b) . It would be useful to compare NECT to interventions that have recently come or are near entry to the market (e.g., fexinidazole Page 92 of 321 (Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) 2014b) and rapid diagnostic tests (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics n.d.; B\u00fcscher et al. 2014) ). Shaw et al (Shaw 1989; Shaw & Cattand 2001) and Lutumba (Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) both made reference to the benefits of combining interventions for treatment, and it would be wise for stakeholders to move beyond this and develop more complicated and time -sensitive strategies with interventions not only on their own but in combination to identify the most cost -effective pathways towards elimination. There are still some additional considerations that have not been considered as components in HAT economic evaluations. Although T. b. gambiense HAT contributes to 95% of the HAT disease (World Health Organizati on (WHO) 2013a) , separate strategies for T. b. rhodesiense could also be considered. Cultural beliefs and attitudes towards HAT will also play a role in the effectiveness of interventions (Leygues & Gouteux 1989) , and although education and community sensitization programs for HAT have been e valuated in terms of their societal benefit and impact on changing knowledge and behaviour (Kovacic et al. 2013; Palmer et al. 2014; Waiswa & Kabasa 2010) , no studies have shown their benefit in terms of cost - effectiveness. Methods of delivery and integration of health systems should al so be further explored in terms of accessibility and availability, as resource constraints and lack of access in remote areas may delay elimination timelines if not considered beforehand (Laveissiere et al. 1998; Simarro et al. 2014) . Potential Use of Cost -Effective Modelling for HAT Control and Elimination It was quite evident from the literature review that modelling will play a role in the economic evaluation of HAT. Most of the previous economic evaluations conducted were based on models, and modelling is known to assist with forecasting f uture economic consequences (Drummond et al. 2005) . Decision ma kers would benefit from the use of whole disease modelling of alternative elimination scenarios because it would allow them to consider the implications and incremental benefits of each potential strategy. Previous economic evaluation studies reliant on mo delling have addressed how individual interventions reduced transmission but not how these interventions, or combinations of them, could lead to eventual Page 93 of 321 elimination or interruption of disease transmission. Current modelling techniques for economic evaluat ion, including those used to evaluate the impact of uncertainty related to model parameters, would also be useful for decision makers in communicating the consequences of choosing non- cost-effective strategies (Claxton 1999) . Additionally, modelling the feasibility of interventions through health service delivery is also necessary. For example, the results from an economic evaluation regarding diagnostic algorithms (Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) showed that sometimes even the most cost- effective tools may not be affordable or feasible in some of the locations where HAT occurs (Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) . Potential Use of Economic Evalua tion Methodology in HAT Control and Elimination A few considerations of cost- effective interventions could be gleaned from the few economic evaluations found. This was highlighted in the scenario described by Lutumba et al. (Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) in which case -detection with treatment was more cost- effective than treatment alone, and an economic evaluation of diagnostic a lgorithms showed that the addition of tests to CATT could increase cost -effectiveness (Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) . Treatment were considered cost -effective (Politi et al. 1995; Robays et al. 2008) for patients with HAT T. b. gambiense , and Politi's analysis in 1995 also demonstrated a good understanding of economic outcomes because dominance was assessed and the importance of the efficiency frontier was illustrated (Politi et al. 1995) . Dom inance refers to the economic concept that an intervention that costs less and has better outcomes relative to its comparator is considered dominant (Drummond et al. 2005) . In regards to budgeting, sensitivity analyses (Shaw 1989; Shaw & Cattand 2001; Lutumba, Robays, Miaka, et al. 2005b) demonstrated that prevalence is related to costs. This will be important to consider because the cost per patient will increase towards the end g oal of HAT elimination , but the overall cost per benefit still needs to be ascertained . The economic evaluations reviewed presented some methodological inconsistencies. For example, t here was a lack of clarity in reporting costs and consequences increm entally to a base -case scenario or relative to the next- best intervention. Historically calculations may have Page 94 of 321 been done this way because of the \"generalized cost- effectiveness\" method (Hutubessy et al. 2003) , but if incremental and net benefits are always compared to \"do nothing\" instead of to the next -best option available, then the consequences of this methodology could lead to error (Weinstein 1990) . Furthermore, when multiple strategies are being considered, dominance needs to be examined. Although four out of seven studies had more than two competing strategies, dominance was only addressed once. Evaluations that ignore dominance could lead to decision errors in which the health utility is not maximised at a societal level (Drummond et al. 2005; Torrance et al. 1972) . Cost -effecti veness was also referred to by the authors without making reference to a cost -effectiveness threshold. WHO -CHOICE (WHO n.d.) has defined thresholds previously; however, it is not clear if these thresholds values are acceptable for all global stakeholders because the authors did not always refer to a threshold value to determine cost-effectiveness. The methodology of CEA with different interv entions permits one to compare varying strategies across a disease, but the outcomes need to be unified so that decision makers can assess these comparators with ease and clarity. It is evident from this review that although CEA research may be conducted, the results are hard to interpret without standardization or reporting in a common metric (e.g., cost per DALY) . Following existing guidelines for economic evaluation such as the SIGN Guidelines (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) n.d.) and the more recent Conso lidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement (Husereau et al. 2013) or developing guidelines that stakeholders feel acceptable for an elimination strategy would allow for consistency of analyses for HAT and other neglected tropical diseases. Formal economic evaluation guidelines and even a standard reference case have be en developed by various public health funders (Stevens & Longson 2013; Cana dian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) 2006; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) International 2014) , and researchers should consider these standards to further the future of CEA within tropical disease and disease elimination decision -making. In addition, traditional CEA measures two outcomes (cost and effects), but programs for elimination also need to consider time. Health economists will need to consider how to make recommendations to stakeholders for strate gy prioritization considering all three elements for elimination. Page 95 of 321 3.6 Conclusions This review has demonstrated that previous research highlights the main components that play a role in elimination. Furthermore, cost -effective modelling and economic evaluation have been used and could address future economic concerns regarding elimination. Researchers interested in evaluating economic concerns regarding HAT elimination should think about modelling elimination strategies to assess cost -effectiveness using standa rdized methodology in order to assist stakeholder and key funders. These analyses would be of use since HAT is currently being prioritized as a NTD to reach elimination by 2020. Page 96 of 321 4.

A systemati c review of the published literature on the costs of HAT prevention, treatment, and control, in addition to the economic burden, was conducted. All studies that contained primary or secondary data on costs of prevention, treatment and control were consider ed, resulting in the inclusion of 42 papers. The geographically focal nature of the disease and a lack of standardization in the cost data limit the usefulness of the available information for making generalizations across diverse settings. More recent inf ormation on the costs of treatment and control interventions for HAT is needed to provide accurate information for analyses and planning. The cost information contained herein can be used to inform rational decision making in control and elimination progra ms, and to assess potential synergies with existing vector -borne disease control programs, but programs would benefit significantly from new cost data collection. 4.2 Introduction Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), which is also known as sleeping sickness, i s caused by an infection with either of two parasites : Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense or Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Both types are transmitted by different tsetse fly species. They are microscopically indistinguishable, but occur in separate areas of Su b-Saharan Africa (SSA). A total of 37 countries between 14N and 20S latitude and covering 1.55 million km2 have reported cases (P P Simarro et al. 2012; Pere P Simar ro et al. 2012) . T.b. gambiense occurs in west and central Africa, while T.b. rhodesiense is endemic in east ern and southern Africa. There is no overlap between the endemic areas with Uganda being the only country endemic for both forms, albeit in different areas of the country (Burri 2008) . An estimated 70million people (P P Simarro et al. 2012; Pere P Simarro et al. 2012) and about 50 million head of cattle are at risk of trypanosomiasis infection (Fevre, Wissmann, et al. 2008; Kristjanson et al. 1999) . The main reservoir host for T.b. gambiense is humans, while cattle or wild bovids serve as the main reservoir host for T.b. rhodesiense . Animal to human, animal to animal, and human to human transmission all occur with T.b. rhodesiense. Transmission varies as a function of vector density and biting behaviour . A total of 7216 HAT cases for both T.b gambiense and T.b rhodesiense were Page 98 of 321 reported in 2012 (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) and the World Health Organiza tion (WHO) estimates the number of actual infections to be around 20,000 (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) . In 2014, WH O approved a declaration to tar get gambiense HAT elimination (Holmes 2014) and one to target rhodesiense HAT (WHO n.d.) .A previous review of the available economic evalu ations for HAT (Sutherland et al. 2015) demonstrates that although cost -effectiveness has been assessed previously for control of the disease little is known about the cost -effectiveness of strategies targeting elimination. Funding and support for HAT declined from the1970s through the 1990s, contributing to the resurgence of the disease in the late 1990s (Smith et al. 1998) ; however, since the WHO's roadmap to NTD control and elimination was pub lished in 2012 (WHO 2012) , there is a renewed commitment from global stakeholders to achieve HAT elimination by 2020 (Zhang et al. 2010; London Declaration 2013; WHO 2012; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation n.d.) . This requires that the total cost of potential strategies for elimination along with current and emergi ng technologies (Steinmann et al. 2015) are accurately estimated to ensure that funding is sustained throughout the elimination process. The purpose of this paper is t o summarize the available infor mation on costs for HAT prevention, tre atment, and control to serve as a reference for future economic evaluations and national budgeting endeavours. The paper begins with a brief description of the treatment, prevention and control strategies for the disease to provide relevant contextual information and some potential interventions for elimination. It then presents a systematic review of the published literature that included primary and secondary data on costs, indirect costs and economic burden related to HAT programs. The paper con cludes with a discussion on pri ority areas of economic data collection for elimination strategy development . Prevention, treatment, control of HAT In general, the prevention of HAT includes reducing bites from tsetse flies, early diagnosis and treatment of cases. While indi vidual protection against bites may be useful in some instances, the fly can penetrate light weight clothing and repellants are not common in many endemic areas. Thus community level vector con trol and screen and treat programs, which involve the detection of human cases for subsequent treatment, are typically employed together. Several techniques are recommended for the control of tsetse fly populations: sequential aerial insecticide spraying to tar -get adult flies during the first spray and ts etse flies Page 99 of 321 as they emerge from pupal stages in the ground during subsequent sprays; ground spraying to target pupae and resting flies; the use of odor -baited or visual -baited (e.g. black or blue cloth) insecticide treated traps and targets; sterile insect release; and insecticide treatment of cattle(ICT) (Welburn et al. 2009) . A total of 13 Sleeping Sickness National Control Programs are developing vect or control activities (out of 24 countries reporting HAT cases) (J R Franco et al. 2014) , although in some countries institutions other than national control programs are also engaged in vector control activities. Few drugs are available for the treatment of trypanosome infections. Pentamidine and suramin are the main treatments for 1st stage T.b. gambiense and T.b. rhodesiense, respectively (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) .The 2nd stage of T.b. rhodesiense is treated with the organo - arsenica l compound melarsoprol (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) , which is associated with severe adverse reactions, mainly arsenical encephalopathy, occur -ring in 10% of the patients and fatal (10- & combination therapy (NECT) is currently the treatment of choice for stage 2 T.b. gambiense and is listed on the WHOs Model List of Essential Medicines (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML 18 eng.pdf?ua=1). It involv es an in - hospital treatment com bining intravenous infusions of eflornithine with oral treatments of nifurtimox (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) . An alternative treatment for T.b gambiense is eflornithine monotherapy which must be given in a high dose for an extended duration and is recommended when NECT is unavailable, but is not as well tolerated as NECT (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) . Melarsoprol is used when patients treated with NECT relapse (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) . New treatments are currently being developed: fexinidazole is a 10- day oral medication (Tarral 2014) that could potentially be used even if health systems lack the infrastructure or resources to administer NECT. Anothe r potential treatment option is a single -dose oxaborole compound (Tarral 2014) , allowing patients to be potentially treated locally and thus avoiding travel to specialized treatment centres that are often far from h ome. Active and passive case finding are crucial to identify and treat cases to curb transmission. Page 100 of 321 4.3 Methods A systematic electronic search of literature published in the English and French language was conducted using PubMed (MED -LINE), EMBASE, and JSTOR databases in 2013. The following search terms were used: trypanosomiasis, African sleeping sickness, and (econ, economics, cost, cost -effectiveness, cost -benefit, economic, internal rate of return, eradication, elimination, h ealth systems, vertical, integration). All results were initially reviewed for relevance based on a review of the title and abstract; the selected publications were then further reviewed for relevance using the full text. The bibliographies of identified r eferences were also searched, as well as the grey literature using Google and Open Content search engines. All papers with primary or secondary data on economic burden, costs of interventions, or health system implications of control and elimination progra ms were selected for more detailed review. All papers with primary data on costs of any topic related to treatment, prevention, control, indirect costs and economic burden were included. Figure 9 illustrates the incremental results of the search. A total of 960 papers were identified as potentially relevant; a total of 42 papers met the criteria. All cost data were adjusted to USD in the year of the initial study (if th e researchers had not already done so) if this information was available using historical exchange rate data from the Oanda currency converter (http://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/). If information on the year of the study was not available, the year o f the publication was used as a basis for adjustment. The availability of historical exchange rates varies across countries; as such, studies identified with foreign cost data prior to historical exchange rate availability were first converted to USD using the first year exchange rate data were available. All costs were then adjusted to 2012 USD using the U.S. Gross Domestic Product Deflator series from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis( http://www.bea.gov ). Page 101 of 321 Figure 9. Incremental search results and final studies included 4.4 Results Prevention: vector control costs Sequential aerosol techniques Sequential aerosol techniques (SA T) refer to the spraying of tar geted areas with a non -residual insecticide from a fixed wing of an airplane at set intervals. The first spray is designed to kill adults, with subsequent sprays targeted at killing young adult tsetse as they emerge from puparia buried in the ground but before they deposit larvae. Few co st estimates of SAT were identified. Shaw and others used data collected from SAT activities in Botswana to develop a cost model and hypothetical budget for Uganda; SAT in both settings were estimated to cost USD 410.56 per km2, with the bulk of costs incu rred due to flying time of the aircraft and type of insecticide used (Shaw et al. 2007; Shaw et al. 2013) .While relatively few peer reviewed Page 102 of 321 published studies of SAT were identified through electronic searches, several secondary sources of historical cost data from African locations were noted in Allsopp and Hursey (Allsopp & Hursey 2004) . Botswana and Zambia (1973, 1980) repor ted USD 231.95 per k m2 of Endosulfan and pyrethroids; Nigeria (1977) reported USD 890.62 per km2of Endosulfan (Lee 1983) ; Cote d'Ivoire (1979) reported USD 617.00 per appli cation of Endosulfan (Lee 1983) ; and Zambia (1968-1978) reported a ra nge of USD 827.38-1,103.19 per k m2, although the insecticide used was not mentioned (Allsopp & Hursey 2004; Evinson & Kathuria 1984) . One study in West Africa also reported the cost of non -SAT from a helicopter to be between USD 1.55 - 2.75per hectare, assuming 2000- 3,500 hectares covered per application, respectively (F. E. Brandl 1988) . The historical literature also suggests that the cost per area covered is inversely proportional to the total area sprayed, because fixed and capital costs for SAT do not increase proportionally with the total area covered. Additionally it is noted that elimination of tsetse from t argeted areas requires high dosages of insecticide sprayed five times at narrow spray band widths, while SAT or other aerial insecticide application targeted only at control of tsetse could relax all these parameters and perhaps reduce cost per km2 by 30 -50% (Allsopp & Hursey 2004) . Across several ecologically distinct settings, SAT in general is thought to cost between USD 285.81 628.79 per k m2 (Cattand et al. 2001) . Sterile insect techniques Sterile insect technique (SIT) refers to mass release of sterile male tsetse flies, which then compete with non -sterile males to mate with females, resulting in a dult female flies unable to produce offspring. This method of vector control is generally used in areas where the number of flies is rela tively low; as such, it is typi cally employed following SAT or other vector control strategies that first reduce vector density. Using a 10% discount rate, SIT was esti mated to cost USD 840.76 per km2 over a ten year period (Shaw et al. 2007) . In West Africa, the estimated the cost of adding SIT to an existing intervention was USD 970.00/km2, although in areas where substantially fewer sterile males would be required, the cost of SIT could fall to USD 303.12 - 363.75/km2 (Feldman 2004) depending on how many sterile males are released per kilometre and the cost of the flight plan emplo yed (Vale & Torr 2005) . Page 103 of 321 Ground spraying Ground based spraying of insecticides can be conducted using either pressurized spray pumps or thermal fogging equipment and may be targeted to wide swaths or to specific areas or habitat believed to be tsetse resting areas. Relatively litt le literature on the costs of ground spraying was identified, including three s tudies cited which could not be obtained in hard copy for review, but whose results are summarized from secondary sources. A study during the late 1950's in Kenya reported groun d spraying costs at USD 367.26 per km2. In Nigeria, from 1955 to 1969, costs were reported to range between USD 29.74 -592.84 per km2; and, in Zimbabwe during the early 1980's cost ranged between USD260.68- 274.05 per km2 (Allsopp & Hursey 2004) . One study reported cost between USD 315.00-1,574.98 per km2 in 1989, although no additional information was provided (Shaw 1989) . Traps and targets Traps and targets refer to direc t suppression methods that func tion by trapping flies or by using visual attractants suc h as large dark coloured cloth (targets), which can be treated with insecticide. These tools can be baited with odo ur based attractants to attract flies from a distance, or modified in variou s manners and produced in alter nate sizes and shapes. Such vector control tools have been deployed for direct tsetse suppression and as a barrier method to prevent invasion/re -invasion of tsetse into specific geographic areas. Costs first estimated in 1997 have recently been updated, sug gesting that targets cost between USD 266.75 and USD 466.81 per km2 (Shaw 2004; Barrett 1997) . The cost of using targets to produce a linear barrier has been estimated to be U SD 2425.00 per km to establish and USD 1940 per km per year to maintain (Shaw 2004) . The cost of using monopyramidal traps are estimated at USD 31.52 per km2, assuming 17 cattle per km2 (Shaw 2004) . The cost of targets has also been estimated at USD 305.76 per km2 in Botswana (McCord et al. 2013; Mullins et al. 1999) , and USD 128.03when used for control (Allsopp & Hursey 2004; McCord et al. 2012) . Traps used for reclamation purposes have been est imated to cost between USD 1.05 and USD 2.05 per hectare per year over a period of 5-20 years, when fully discounted (F E Brandl 1988) . The cost perkm2when traps and targets are deployed for elimination purposes ranges from USD 343.14 and USD 880.27 per km2, depending on the discount rate and the number of traps depl oyed per km2 (Shaw et al. 2007) . Other factors influencing trap or target cost include the size and type of trap Page 104 of 321 used, insecticide or odour based attractant used and dosage, as well as the deployment method and density and lifetime o f the trap in the field (Shaw et al. 2007; Esterhuizen et al. 2011) . Insecti cide treated cattle (ITC) In West Africa ITC is mainly limited to control of animal trypanosomiasis (nagana), but in East Africa it has also been shown to help control HAT because cattle serve as an important reservoir for T.b. rhodesiense . The costs for ITC vary depending on the scope of application (i.e., whole cattle pour -on vs. leg and belly appli cation only), the density of cattle in the area, and the insecticide chosen. The cost of ITC has been estimated to be USD 164.54 per km2 for the full pour -on treatment when there are 15 cattle per km2 (Barrett, 1997; Budd, 1999; Shaw, 2004). Updated cost estimates from Uganda suggest that the least expensive application is tr eatment of cattle legs and belly with -cypermethrin spray (USD14.55 per km2 assuming 8 cattle per km2) followed by full body -cypermethrin spray (USD 67.90 per km2) and pour on treatment(USD 218.25 per km2) (Shaw et al. 2007) . Models restricting the application of insecticide to only the legs and bellies of cattle, where most tsetse bites occur, produced similar cost estimates (Torr et al. 2007; Vale & Torr 2005) .

In Africa, approximately 1% of patients die due to pentamidine, though why pentamidine mortality occurs is not well explored (Burri 2008) . No costing studies on the treatment of first stage HAT due to T.b. gam biense with pentamidine were identified in the literature search. Costs of pentamidine treatment were estimated by Lutumba et al. (Lutumba, Meheus, et al. 2007) and Shaw and Cattand (Shaw & Cattand 2001) to be USD 2.05 per vial and USD 25.61 total drug costs, respec tively. Suramin, although effec tive as a treatment for first stage illness is largely avoided for T.b.gambiense infection because of the potential for allergic reactions associated with onchocerciasis co -infection (Burri 2008) . The recommended treatment for first stage T.b. rhodesiense infection is suramin administe red parenterally over a period lasting up to 30 days (Burri 2008) . Record reviews of hospital data combined with past literature w ere used to estimate the cost of treatment for early and late stage T.b. rhodesiense in Urambo district Tanzania; although this study failed to differentiate costs of late stage versus early stage patients, they reported an estimated cost of USD 130.95 per patient, i ncluding admission, hospitalization, diagnostic and patient costs. Of this, the patient paid USD 30.31 out-of-pocket, while the net cost to the health system was estimated to be USD 100.64 (Matemba et al. 2010) .The first line second -stage treatment of T.b gambiense is NECT and has been estimated to cost USD 1550.74 for a kit containing 4treatments resulting in the cost of USD 387.68 for one treatment. (Pere P Simarro et al. 2012) Alternative treatments such as melarsoprol or eflornithine may be used as well (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) . Using clinical data from T.b. gambiense patients in Caitxo, Angola, a decision tree model was developed to estimate the total cost per patient treated, including costs of supportive care in addition to adverse events such as arsenical encephalopathy; treatment with melarsoprol was USD 708.03, while treatment per patient with elflornithine was approximately USD 997.14 (Robays et al. 2008) . Eflornithine was more efficacious in terms of mortality prevention; this translated into improved cost -effectiveness for ef lornithine vs. melarsoprol despite the higher cost. Melarsoprol is currently the only drug available for treatment of stage II T.b rhodesiense infection. No studies on the costs of tr eatment for stage II T.b. rhode siense infection were Page 109 of 321 identified; however, as the treatment regimen is expected to be similar to that used for stage II T.b. gambiense infection, the costs from the two studies discussed above may be relevant (Robays et al. 2008; Politi et al. 1995) . No specific studies on the costs of encephalopathy as a severe adverse event associated with the administration of melarsoprol were identified; however, the direct costs of management of these complications were estimated in the context of the decision model discussed above to be between USD 23.60-59.00 (Robays et al. 2008) .The cost of the new treatment options, fexinidazole has been estimated to be less than USD 50 per patient (Tarral 2014) while no estimates have been confirmed fo r oxaborole.

There is little in the literature about specific costs of hospitalization for treatment due to HAT. When including both early and late stage infections, the mean length of a hospital stay has been estimated at 25 days (Matemba et al. 2010) . In this study the total costs to the health service were estimated to be USD 2.42 per patient per night in the hospital and USD 1.21 per initial diagnosis. A second study in Ango la estimated the auxiliary staff cost to be USD 7.43 and USD 17.70 per patient per day for treatment with melarsoprol and eflornithine, respectively; the cost of expatriate staff regardless of which drug was used was estimated to be USD 6.73 (Robays et al. 2008) . In addition, the cost of nurse time per diem for the administration of melarsoprol and eflornithine is USD 5.90-17.70 and USD 5.90 - 23.60, respectively; the cost of an adverse event associated with the administration of melarsoprol is estimated to be USD 44.61 (Robays et al. 2008) . Control costs for HAT Case detection and surveillance costs Of the 60 million people estimated to be at risk for HAT, only 3 -4 million are under any form of surveillance (Cattand et al. 2001) . A 2001 paper by Shaw and Cattand builds on a series of previ ous WHO reports and analytical work on control and surveillance of trypanosomiasis to outline f ive potential surveillance meth ods and to estimate their costs and cost- effectiveness using as spreadsheet model (Shaw & Cattand 2001) . These include active case detection, which is divided into (1) monovalent surveillance teams looking only for sleeping sickness, (2) polyvalent teams looking for other diseases in addition to HAT, and (3) sampling of community workers to collect blood on filter paper. Passive case detection, which is divided into (4) fixed -post surveillance or traditional surveillance in which patients who cannot be diagnosed with another disease are eventually referred to a HAT treatment center for further testing, or (5) sampling of patients at rural health centres to collec t blood on filter paper regardless of the reason for the patients original presentation. Road blocks near health centers have also been used as a form of active case detection. Table 10 summarizes costs associated with case detection and surveillance. Page 111 of 321 Table 10.

Controlled lumbar punctures are recommended for late stage Page 112 of 321 West African trypanosomiasis every 6 months for up to 3years after diagnosis and therapy. In East African trypanosomiasis they should be carried out more frequently (i.e. every 3 months during the first year). The cost of CATT is estimated at USD 2.51 per test (Molyneux et al. 2010) . Costs associated with diagnostic tests, in addition to new loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methodologies are presented in Table 9. Some of the treatment and surveillance studies noted above also include the costs of diagnosis of the disease in their total cost estimates (Shaw & Cattand 2001) . Economic burden Human and animal trypanosomiasis has been estimated to cause a large economic burden to families a nd livestock producers in endemic areas. The diseases are thought to be important contributors to rural underdevelopment (Kristjanson et al. 1999; Budd 1990; Swallow 2000) . While thi s review focuses on the human health and economic effects of HAT, T.b. rhodiesiense, which infects both humans and animals, may al so be responsible for a signifi cant economic impact through limitations on land use and livestock rearing due to increased mor tality and limited weight gain among infected livestock (Jemal et al. 1995; Jemal & Hugh al. 1991; Wilson et al. 1986; M Kamuanga et al. 2001) .Although the economic impact of trypanosomi asis has been addressed in recent years, much of this research has been focused on animal trypanosomiasis (nagana or other variants). While HAT is related and overlapping geograph ically with transmission of ani mal trypanosomiasis, interactions between the two diseases and the associated economic impacts are fairly complex. For instance in areas where similar vectors tra nsmit both human and animal try panosomes, vector control interventions against tsetse are likely to reduce the burden of both human and anim al disease. Similarly in East Africa where the parasite affects both humans and ani mals, many preventative and treatment interventions could bring benefits through reduced tran smission to both humans and ani mals. However, in West Africa where T.b. gambiens e infects only humans, trypanosome targeted in terventions, such as case detec tion and treatment, are likely to bring benefits only to humans; interventions targeting the trypanosomiasis burden in livestock may provide benefits to human s only through improv ed agricul tural productivity, and are unrelated to the burden of HAT, except where these interventions might have an effect on vectors that transmit the human parasite. More Page 113 of 321 complicated to estimate or measure are the indirect costs wh ich could be the resul t of long - term changes in production systems or land use due to the presence or risk of trypanosomiasis in both animal and human populations (Shaw, 2004). Several studies were identified that attempted to quantify the economic burden of African trypanosomi asis, or estimate returns to investment in the control of animal or human trypanosomiasis (Wilson et al. 1986; Woudyalew Mulatu, Swallow, B.M. et al. 1997; Rowlands et 1999; BLANC et 1994; F. Brandl 1988; Putt et al. 1980) . It is also estimated that across sub - Saharan Africa farmers spends upwards of USD 30 to 40 million a year on trypanocides to protect their livestock (Holmes & Geerts 2004) . Approximately 45 -50 Million cattle are thought to live in zones of trypanosomiasis risk (Kristjanson et al. 1999; Budd 1990) ; significant increases in numbers of adult cattle and in cattle ownership were observed after the rollout of tsetse control measures in Burk ina Faso (M Kamuanga et al. 2001) . In the late 1990s it was estimated that improved trypanosomiasis control could return benefits of USD 700 million per year in Africa in terms of meat and milk productivity alone, and USD 1.3 billion if producer and consumer surpluses were considered (Kristjanson et al. 1999) ; other studies estimated considerably higher increases in annual agricultural out -put of approximately USD 4.5 billion (Budd 1990; Swallow 2000) .Using interviews, one study estimated the direct and indirect costs to patients and their families to be a net loss of appr oximately 25% of the families' annual income per case (Gouteux et al. 1987) . Additional results from a study in the DRC reported that the media n loss per HAT patient household on average was USD249.94, which is approximately 43% of annual household revenue based on agricultural (Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) , while in Tanzania USD 30.54-61.08 was the estimated total household loss (Reid et al. 2012) . Out -of-pocket expenses for patients and their f amilies also contribute to economic burden for HAT. Matemba and colleagues (Matemba et al. 2010) found that on average USD 0.59 per night was required for relatives accompanying the patient to the hospital for treatment. Matemba and colleagues (Matemba et al. 2010) also found a return trip for treatment had a mean cost of USD 7.91, while meals were USD 17.70 per patient treat ed. Family member s that had to pay for accommoda tion, on average spent USD 29.50 over the course of treatment. Out -of-pocket payments were also required for direct medical expenses including a screening treatment card (USD 0.46 - 0.57) (Robays et al. 2008) or lab tests (USD 0.59) (Matemba et al. 2010) . Lastly, non -medical costs for hospital patients have been estimated to Page 114 of 321 be USD 80.72 in rural Tanzania, including the costs associated with an accompanying person to the hospital/clinic (Matemba et al. 2010) . 4.5 Discu ssion This paper reviews the literature on the costs associated with the prevention, treatment and control of HAT. This information is important, as donors and control programs increase funding and attention to strategies for eventual elimination. Importan tly, this review lends insight into the scarcity of literature on costs that if updated, could improve the efficiency of prevention and control activities. In addition, this information is useful for collating cost information in a common valuation system is also important for stakeholders interested in develop ing economic evaluations to aid the decision making process. There were few studies focused specifically on the costs related to health systems research principles to the prevention, control, or treat ment of HAT. This is likely due to the limited focal nature of the disease, which complicates our general understanding of how HAT control and treatment interaction complement one another. Though large swaths of the African continent are theoretically at risk, in reality there are relatively few cases, which tend to be con centrated in known foci. For this reason, potential health system interactions likely have limited application at a national or regional scale. It is likely that HAT deaths are greatly underreported (Odiit et al. 2004) . Underreporting suggests that there is a gap in terms of how HA T control and treatmen t impact health information sys tems. Improving disease surveillance and case detection is seen as one of the great challenges to reducing morbidity and mortality due to HAT. While polyvalent screening teams might be more efficient than the use of single purpose HAT active case detection (Shaw & Cattand 2001) , the disease remains highly focal and thus investment in the use of integrated surveillance is unlikely to impact health information system quality or coverage outside of the foci of HAT transmission. In addition, since HAT is invariably fatal if left untreated, all medicines required for HAT care must be considered essential for HAT endemic countries, and are listed as essential drugs by the WHO. As a neglected tropical disease, relatively little funding f or new drug development is available gl obally, and the drugs for treat ment of the disease are not marketed. These drugs (elfornithine, pentamidine and melarsoprol manufactured by Sanofi -Aventis, and suramin and nit rofurimox manufactured Page 115 of 321 by Bayer Schering Pharma) are made available freely to the WHO by the manufacture rs. We were unable to identify any studies examining the impacts of HAT programs on the availability and quality of human resources. Much of the control of HAT is based on vector control programs , which are typically vertically organized and run either in par allel or entirely outside of existing health system infrastructure. They thus pose a risk for diversion of human resources outside of the public health sector in some cases. Alternatively, sur veillance strategies could be built on exi sting health management information systems (HMIS) or community based surveillance platforms potentially improving both, albeit in the limited areas of HAT foci. Another gap relates to a paucity of cost information on how HAT control and treatment impacts service delivery. While the global impact of HAT treatment on service delivery is likely limited, the need for invasive and painful diagnostic measures (i.e. lumbar puncture ) and dangerous treatme nts that require expensive moni toring over long periods of time suggests the potential for a serious burden on the health systems delivery of other services in areas with significant case -loads. Furth ermore, there is documented evi dence of increases in HAT transmission and risk in areas of conflict, both increasing the burden of disease in areas with major challenges for service delivery but also disproportionately increasing the need for improved service delivery (Berran g-Ford et al. 2011) . Lastly, many of the studies identified lack standardization in terms of cost estimates, methods for presenting results, criteria for which costs are presented, and an overall accounting of all inputs as part of a treatment or contro l program. In addition, many of the vector control costs are quite old. This complicates the dif ferentiation between financial and economic costs, which in turn creates challenges when making comparisons. In the context of increased attention to neglected topical diseases in general, and HAT specifically, recent and standardized information on the costs for prevention, treatment and control interventions is needed. 4.6 Conclusion The disease and disability resulting from HAT infectio n is enor mous, which could n egatively affect overall productivity of an individual and household. The results of this review show that recent and standardized information on the costs for prevention, treatment and control interventions is very scarce. While the lit erature available o n costs provides useful Page 116 of 321 information, most of the literature is outdated, focused on specific ecological contexts within countries, and is limited in terms of usefulness for developing estimates of the economic burden across Africa. The information presente d herein should be updated to improve cost estimation. The collection of relevant and current cost data could play a meaningful role in funding and advocacy for resource mobilization for the control and elimination of HAT. 4.7 Acknowledgments This research was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun dation - through a Grant awarded to the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (grant number OPP1037660).

Page 118 Summary Background Trypanosoma brucei (T b) gambiense is targeted to reach elimination as a public health problem by 2020 and full elimination by 2030. To achieve these goals, stakeholders need to consider strategies to accelerate elimination. Hence, we aimed to model several options related to current and e merging methods for case detection, treatment, and vector control across settings to assess cost- eectiveness and the probability of elimination. Methods Five intervention strategies were modelled over 30 years for low, moderate, and high transmission settings. Model parameters related to costs, ecacy, and transmission were based on available evidence and parameter estimation. Outcomes included disability -adjusted life-years (DALYs), costs, and long -term prevalence. Sensitivity analyses were done to calculate the uncertainty of the results. Findings To reach elimination targets for 2020 across all settings, approaches combining case detection, treatment, and vector control would be most eective. Elimination in high and moderate transmission areas was probable and cost - eective when strategies included vector control and novel methods, with incremental cost -eectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from US$400 to $1500 per DALY averted. In low transmission areas, approaches including the newest interventions alon e or in combination with tiny targets (vector control) were cost -eective, with ICERs of $200 or $1800 per DALY averted, respectively, but only strategies including vector control were likely to lead to elimination. Results of sensitivity analyses showed that allowing for biennial surveillance, reducing vector control maintenance costs, or variations of active surveillance coverage could also be cost -eective options for elimination, depending on the setting. Interpretation Although various strategies might lead to elimination of T b gambiense , cost-eective approaches will include adoption of emerging technologies and, in some settings, increased surveillance or implementation of vector control.

(Jose R Franco et al. 2014) According to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Eval uation (IHME), human African trypanosomiasis contributes an estimated 560 262 disability -adjusted life -years (DALYs) to the global burden of disease and ranks sixth in reference to the number of deaths among neglected tropical diseases.(GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators 2014) T b gambiense is primarily maintained in a human -tsetse cycle, whereas T b rhodesiense transmission entails a large spectrum of reservoir animals, mainly game. Thus, elimination eorts have primarily targeted T b gambiense . In 2011, WHO published a roadmap towards overcoming the impact of ten neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), (WHO 2012) and this commitment was renewed in January, 2012, as the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, supported by the collaboration Uniting to Combat NTDs, became a new benchmark for elimination goals. It was then that the goal of control, described as reduction of disease to acceptable levels, was shifted to elimination, which pursues zero incidence in a dened geographical area. (Dowdle 1998) Human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense was one of the di seases targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2020, which is dened as less than one case per 10 000 people per year,(WHO 2012; World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) and complete elimination by 2030. As the year 20 20 approaches, stakeholders committed to T b gambiense elimination have recognised that current interventions are resource- intensive, costly, and infeasible in remote or sociopolitically unstable areas, hindering foreseen elimination goals.(World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a; Holmes 2014; Yamey et al. n.d.) Moreover, with several emerging novel technologies and approaches for surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and preven tion (vector control) of T b gambiense, now is the time to investigate whether new technologies can accelerate elimination and, if so, how to allocate current resources to the right combination of interventions. (Tediosi et al. 2013) We aimed to analyse the cost- eectiveness of strategies for control and elimin ation of human African trypano somiasis caused by T b gambiense and to forecast the eect of these approac hes Page 120 of 321 on disease transmission. The outcomes presented here aim to assist decision makers in determining which strategies are most likely to lea d to elimination and will show good value for money. 5.3 Methods Potential strategies for control and elimination Various scenarios of current interventions and emerging methods have been proposed for control and elimination of human African try panosomiasis caused by T b gambiense. (Steinmann et al. 2015) We developed a se ries of strategies using these scenarios over time to ascertain which combination of interventions would be most likely to sustain control or ac celerate towards elimination. After preliminary modelling (appendix C.7 ), we identied ve strategies as relevant options for control or eliminatio n of human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense , which are depicted in Figure 10. Strategy A, \"control\", is one of two st rategies recommended by WHO (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) and aims to bring the number of annual cases to an acceptable level. It focuses on screening and treating patients and reflects the current approach practised by most national sleeping sickness control programmes across sub-Saharan Africa. In strategy A, patients self -report to local health centres (referred to as passive surveillance) and active case- nding is done by teams of health workers who seek out patients living in aected areas (active surveillance). Diagnosis is done in public during in -village sc reening campaigns and requires blood testing for serological conrmation of antigens in response to the parasite. Blood tests are conrmed using the card -agglutination trypanosomiasis test ( CATT). Patients who have a positive CATT undergo parasitological conrmation of the disease. If conrmation i s r e c e i v e d t h e y a r e r e f e r r e d f o r l u m b a r p u n c t u r e t o c h e c k t h e c e r e b r o s p i n a l fl u i d , t o dierentiate if the disease is in the early stages of development (stage 1 disease) or if the parasite has entered the CNS (sta ge 2 disease). In October, 2016, the approved treatment for human African trypanosomiasis on WHO's essential drug list for stage 1 disease was pentamidine, whereas nifurtimox -eflornithine combin ation therapy was the rst -line, parenteral treatment for patie nts who have progressed to stage 2. Page 121 of 321 Strategy B, \"control plus tiny targets\", is the second strategy recommended by WHO and incorporates vector control to supplement the screen -conrm -stage -treat approach. Tiny targets ens measuring 0\u00b75 \u00d7 0\u00b725 m that are more cost - eective and easier to deploy than are their larger predecessors (1 \u00d7 1 m\u00b2 target; Box 1 ).(Shaw et al. 2015; Solano et al. 2013) The remaining three strategies incorporate innovative approaches in relation to surveillan ce, diagnosis, and treatment for control of T b gambiense , which are expected to arrive between 2016 and 2019. Strategy C, \"new technologies 2016\", maintains strategy A until 2016, after which time case -detection will be switched to more flexible teams on m otorbikes and diagnosis o f d i s e a s e w i l l b e d o n e u s i n g a r s t -generation rapid diagnostic test algorithm (panel). Conrmation and staging will be done using the loop -mediated isothermal amplication (LAMP) technique, and treatment for the second stage of di sease will switch to ten oral doses of fexinidazole. This process is continued until 2019, when fexinidazole will be considered for treatment of both stage 1 and 2 disease and a second -generation rapid diagnostic test will be available (panel). Strategy D, \"new technologies 2016 and 2019\", mirrors strategy C until 2019, when a new oxaborole compound, SCYX -7158, will be available for treatment of both stages of disease with one oral dose (Box 1). Figure 10. Summary of potent ial strategies for control and elimination of human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense Feasible scenarios are shown that could lead to elimination of human African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei (T b) gambiense , based on current interventions and those in the pipeline. (Steinmann et al. 2015) Every scenario contains a component of surveillance, diagnostics, and treatment interventions to interrupt transmission of T b gambiense for a population at risk. Pa ssive surveillance is combined with annual active surveillance in high- risk areas and with biennial surveillance in moderate- risk areas. In low -risk settings, active surveillance is not done and reliance is solely on passive surveillance. These approaches are based on recommendations for T b gambiense control outlined by WHO. (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) For all scenarios when the model reaches elimination, it switches to passive surv eillance only (the model assumes no reinvasion of cases or flies after elimination is reached). CATT=card -agglutination trypanosomiasis test. NECT=nifurtimox -eflornithine combination therapy. RDT=rapid diagnostic test. Page 122 of 321 Box 1. Highlights of new treatments and emerging technologies used in the current modelling for control and elimination of human African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense 2013: tiny targets Traditional targets for vector control in the field are quite large and cost ly with r espect to maintenance and deployment. New targets (Vestergaard -Frandsen , Lausanne , Switzerland) are significantly smaller in size and cost less than their large predecessors.(Shaw et al. 2015; Tirados et al. 2015) Tiny targets are made of a blue fabric that attracts flies, which are then killed by the insecticide -impregnated screens. (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine n.d.) 2016: Motorbike surveillance teams Surveillance teams comprised of one or two people on a motorbike are feasible with the newer diagnostic technologies that are easy to carry in a backpack and do not require cold -chain storage. Motorbikes also increase coverage because they can reach areas large trucks cannot access due to roads in poor condition . (Steinmann et al. 2015) 2016: fexinidazole Fexinidazole is a well-tolerated oral treatment to be given for 10 consecutive days(Tarral et al. 2011) currently undergoing Phase III trials (Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) 2014a) for human African trypanosomiasis stage 2 and also y stage 1 patients. 2016: rapid diagnostic test algorithm , 1st generation 1st generation rapid diagnostic test (RDT) have been made available. (B\u00fcscher et al. 2014; Sternberg et al. 2014) This algorithm considers the potential of such tests in combination with loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), for which staging is done using blood instead of cerebrospinal fluid obtained through lumbar puncture. (Steinmann et al. 2015) 2019: rapid diagnostic test algorithm, 2nd generation A 2nd generation RDT with recombinant antigens that requires no additional blood sample or lumbar puncture for parasitological staging and confirmation. (Steinmann et 2019: SCYX -7158 SCYX -7158 is an oxaborole compound currently being tested in a phase I clinical trial, (Maser et al. 2012) Itis a single dose oral tablet that aims to cure both disease stages. (Steinmann et al . 2015) Finally, strategy E, \"new technologies 2016 and 2019 plus tiny targets\", assesses the eect of combining strategy D with tiny targets. In strategies C, D, and E, we assumed that, by 2019, oral treatment will be appropriate for either stage of disease and, hence, parasitological conrmation for staging will no longer be necessary. Based on recommendations by WHO, (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) we assumed that active scr eening was done annually in settings with high transmission and Page 123 of 321 biennially in areas with moderate transmission, and that no active screening component was included in low transmission settings, where detection relies solely on passive surveillance. We also assumed that only passive surveillance would be implemented after elimination, until 2042. We did not model scenarios in which reinvasion of cases (tsetse fly or human) happened after elimination. We based our estimated timelines on every producer's estima te of products in the pipeline for human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense during 2013; hence, the timelines we present here are to be taken as examples because, in reality, technologies could arrive sooner or later on the market than planned . For example, a rst -generation rapid diagnostic test arrived on the market in 2013 and has been used in endemic countries across sub-Saharan Africa since 2016. Moreover, evaluation of a second -generation rapid diagnostic test has been completed by the Fo undation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and commercialisation is now expected in December, 2016, rather than 2019 as forecast ed. Health effect and economic m odel ling To assess the long -term costs, health eects, and likelihood of the given strategi es maintaining control or leading to elimination, we used an ordinary dierential equation model of human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense (Figure 11; app endix C.4).(Chris M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) We divided the human population into several compartments: susceptible (ie, uninfected); infected (but not yet infective); asymptomatic (ie, stage 1 disease); removed (ie, stage 2 disease); or being treated. The asymptomatic state is not synonymous with the absence of symptoms in the clinical sense but is stated as such to dierentiate the primary stage of the disease from the second, more severe, stage. We also tracked the number of people who died from human African tryp anosomiasis over time and assumed that, although human beings have stage 2 disease or are being treated, they are generally recumbent and not present in tsetse habitat. We divided tsetse flies into susceptible, exposed, and infected compartments. We account ed for heterogeneity in exposure to tsetse bites by modelling two human populations, one in which individuals lived and worked in a low transmission setting and the other in which people travelled between a low transmission area and one with greater exposure to tsetse bites. A possible animal reservoir was assumed to not contribute signicantly to transmission of human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense .(Jose R Franco et al. 2014) The model structure, transmission parameters for areas with high, Page 124 of 321 moderate, and low transmission, and investigations of the use of current technologies to reach elimination have been described in detail elsewhere. (Chris M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) We tted the model using a Bayesian importanc e resampling procedure to three stable prevalence levels that coincide with slightly above low (0\u00b702%), moderate (0\u00b7112%), and high (1\u00b761%) transmission areas, dened previously by WHO. Parameters that varied between the strategies related to specic inter ventions are provided in appendix C.2 . For every model run, we allowed populations to reach a stable level of transmission over a 300-year period, in the absence of intervent ions. We then introduced inter ventions as specied by the dierent control and elimination strategies. If elimination was achieved in any run, we switched the interventions to post -elimination activities (passive surveillance). W e tracked the disease burden attributable to human African trypanosomiasis by assigning a DALY value whenever an individual entered a relevant compartment (stage 1 disease, stage 2 disease, or death from disease). We calculated costs associated with interventions through incorporated cost functions. Page 125 of 321 Figure 11. Ordinary differential equation model (A)Heterogeneity captured by diering exposure levels of two populations living in the same area. Population 1 lives and works in a low-exposure habitat (eg, village). Population 2 commutes between habitats with low and high exposure, each harbouring tsetse and animal populations (eg, cattle) of varying sizes. (B) Transmission for populations in each habitat includes susceptible, infec ted, asymptomatic, and removed compartments (health states) for human beings, and susceptible, exposed, and infected compartments for tsetse flies (vectors). Costing inputs, sources, perspective, and outcomes Our analysis is from the perspective of a funder of a national sleeping sickness control programme; we modelled the annual prevalence, costs, and health outcomes (dened as DALYs) (World Health Organization (WHO) n.d.) over 30 years, starting in 2013 (appendix C.1). We discounted costs and DALYs at 3% annually (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) International 2014; World Health Organization (WHO) 2003) and assessed cost- eectiveness by calculating the incremental cost- eecti veness ratio (ICER) of each strategy relative to its next best comparator. We developed a common unit for every intervention within a specic category then calculated a per diem cost based on cost functions for case detection, diagnostics, drug treatment, and vector control interventions. We took data inputs for direct costs from previous work ,(Keating et al. 2015) country reports, expert opinions, and manufacturers, when estimates were not published or available publicly. Cost parameters and formulas for cost functions are available Page 126 of 321 in appendix C.2 . We converted unit prices from countries other than the USA to US$ using purchasing power parity listed in the World Economic Outlook database, (International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2014) and changed costs reported in \u20ac to US$ with the average exchange rate lists published on the European Cent ral Bank Statistical Data Warehouse. We then inflated these values to 2013 prices with average consumer price indices. (International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2014) Uncertainty analysis We did a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to establish the eect of parameter uncertainty on the cost -eectiveness and probability of elimination. We imputed parameters related to surveillance coverage, cost of interventions, cost of drug treatments, case -detection sensitivity, and cost and ecacy of vector control probabilistically based on latin hypercube sampling, and w e ran 500 simulations. A full description of input parameters is provided in the appendix C.2. We plotted probabilistic results as cost- eectiveness acceptability curves for low, moderate, and high trans - mission areas and reported the probability of elimination over the investigated period. We presented results in probabilistic terms and assessed them at two thresholds: elimination as a public health problem (less than one case in 10 000 people) by the year 2020; and full elimination (zero cases) by 2030. We did a one - way sensitivity analysis of discount rates, vector mortality, and coverage levels across all settings. Because we model led no active surveillanc e in low transmission settings (based on WHO recommendations) in the base case analysis, we varied surveillance intensity in this setting to ascertain the potential eect on elimination and cost- eectiveness. Previously, another molecule in development fo r human African trypanosomiasis failed to reach the market in late phase trials.(Wenzler et al. 2009; Harrill et al. 2012) Therefore, we modied and modelled the strategies to assess the potential eect of the oxaborole compound SCYX -7158 experiencing market failure. Furthermore, clinical trials for fexinidazole are underway (NCT02169557); hence, we decided to investigate the potential eect on elimination if fexinidazole arrives on the market earlier than expected (to capture putative positive eects of ongoing trials).

In high t ransmission settings, strategy E \u2014 comprising new technologies in 2016 and 2019 plus tin y targets \u2014resulted in an ICER of $386 per DALY averted. In a moderate transmission setting, strategy E was also cost -eective, at an ICER of $1509 per DALY averted. In low transmission areas, strategy D, consisting solely of new technologies in 2016 and 2019, resulted in an ICER of $160 per DALY averted; the next best approach after this one was strategy E, leading to an ICER of $1812 per DALY averted. Strategy A, the current control, was dominated consistently across settings, meaning that this approach costs more money and averted fewer DALYs. Table 11.

Figure 12 shows the variability surrounding mean costs and DALYs of every strategy and cost - eectiveness acceptability curves. In high transmission areas, at the cost- eectiveness threshold of $400 per DALY averted, strategy E had the highest probability of being cost - eective. In settings of moderate transmission, strategies D and E both had the highest probability of being cost -eective, at a threshold of $1500 per DALY averted. In low transmis sion settings, strategy D had the highest probability of being cost- eective, at a threshold of $200 per DALY averted, but at a threshold of $1800 per DALY averted, strategy B (in which tiny targets are added to current control eorts) had the highest pro bability of being cost-eective, competing with strategy E. The results of the one -way sensitivity analysis are summarised in appendix C.5.2. In hig h transmission areas, strategy E remained cost -eective over a range of parameter variations; however, the ICER for this approach decreased relative to base case estimates when mortality with tiny targets increased ($244 per DALY averted), when annual cost s of vector control maintenance were reduced ($309 per DALY averted), when patients received oral treatments at home exclusively ($318 per DALY averted), or when active surveillance coverage was less than 80% ($49-205 per DALY averted). In areas of moderate transmission, strategy E also remained the most cost -eective option, with reductions in ICER from the base case analysis ranging from $317 to $1447 per DALY averted using the same parameter variations as for high transmission settings. In low transmission settings, strategy D typically remained the most cost-eective option across a range of parameter variations and was near to or lower than $100 per DALY averted either when maximum increases to passive surveillance were attributed to the arrival of fexinidazole on the market ($33 per DALY averted) or when biennial active surveillance campaigns were initiated ($123 per DALY averted). Page 129 of 321 Figure 13 shows that, in high transmission areas, achieving the London Declaration targets for elimination of T b gambiense by 2020 and full elimination in 2030 is probable (appendix C.8). Particularly, strategies with vector control alone or vector control combined with new technologies (strategies B and E, respectively) have a more than 90% chance of reaching elimination in 2020 and 2030, whereas strategies including new technologies alone (strategies C and D) have an 80% chance. If regimens currently in place are maintained (str ategy A), reaching elimination by 2020 or 2030 is le ss likely (roughly 50%). In areas of moderate transmission, all strategies have a more than 80% chance of reaching the London targets by 2020. Full elimination by 2030 would be feasible with strategies that include vector control (96%; strategies B and E), whereas adopting new interventions in the absence of tiny targets (68%; strategies C and D), or current control activities (roughly 50%; strategy A), are less likely to reach full elimination in the next few decades. Similar to moderate transmission setti ngs, in areas of low transmission, achieving elimination as a public health problem is almost certain with strategies that include tiny targets (97-99%; strategies B and E). Adopting new technologies alone without vector control (strategies C and D) are un likely to reach 2020 targets (24-45%) but are superior to the current control approach (0\u00b705%; strategy A). Full elimination in low transmission areas will require strategies that include vector control (83- 86%; strategies B and E), but will lead to delays in achieving elimination goals. In high and moderate transmission areas, where active surveillance is maintained, a decrease in the eectiveness of vector control (from 5\u00b749% to 1% mortality) would have no eect on elimination targets, however; in low tra nsmission areas, ineective vector control would render elimination elusive. Further improving the ecacy of targets (increase from 5\u00b749% to 10%) would have relatively little eect compared with the base case analysis for high transmission areas but would guarantee elimination in moderate and low transmission settings with strategies that include vector control. Including active surveillance in addition to passive surveillance in low transmission areas, whether biennial or annual, would ensure that 2020 eli mination targets will be achiev ed, but full elimination by 2030 is still most likely to occur with strategies that include vector control (appendix C.8). By contrast, the strategy currently in place (strategy A) is least likely to achieve full elimination. Varying the coverage of new technologies in low transmission zones had little eect relative to the base case results; however, an increase in tre atment coverage with the oxaborole compound SCYX -7158 to Page 130 of 321 approxi mately 45% led to a slight increase in the probability of elimination for strategies that included the oxaborole molecule (ie, strategies D and E) in thes e same areas. As provided in appendix C.8, coverage levels were varied in high and moderate transmission areas and showed overall that strategies with vector control (strategies B and E ) would probably lead to elimination even when coverage was as low as 20%. Elimination as a public health problem (less than one in 10 000) was also achievable by 2030 when active screening coverage was equivalent to 60% and if oral tablet interventions be come available (strategies C and D).

Page 132 of 321 Figure 13. Probability o f reaching targets Probability of achieving London declaration targets (left) and full elimination (right) in areas of high, moderate, and low transmission. The London Declaration denes elimination, in concordance with the WHO roadmap, as either elimination as a public health problem or less than one case in 10 000 people. (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) Page 133 of 321 5.5 Discussion Overall, our simulations show that continuing to screen and treat individuals for human African trypanosomiasis caused b y T b gambiense , using currently available drugs and diagnostic methods (strategy A), is not cost -eective compared with alternative strategies that are becoming available. Although this approach might lead to control over the next four decades, it is less likely to reach full elimination across transmission settings by 2030. Adopting new interventions as they arrive on the market in combination with use of tiny targets (strategy E) is the most cost- eective approach for control and elimination of human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense , at a threshold appropriate for low -income and middle -income countries, (The World Bank 2016) while leading to elimination goals in high transmission areas. In moderate transmission zones, continually adopting new tec hnol ogies as they arrive on the market alone (strategy D) or combined with tiny targets (strategy E) has a probabili ty of being cost -eective near thresholds suitable for middle -income nations, (The World Bank 2016) with both these strategies likely to achieve Lon don Declaration targets; however, only strategy E is likely to reach full elimination. In low transmission areas, a conundrum for decision makers between cost -eectiveness and elimination persists. Adopting new interventions in the absence of vector contro l measures (strategy D) has the highest probability of being cost -eective at a threshold of $200 per DALY averted (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) International 2014) but is unlikely to achieve short - term or long term elimination targets. Adding tiny targets to current control measures (strategy B) or in combination with new technologies (strategy E) is more likely to lead to elimination but is only likely to be cost -eective at threshold s above $1500 per DALY averted. (The World Bank 2016) These results highlight the economic constraints for global investments for elimination in area s with moderate and low transmission across sub -Saharan Africa. More than 98% of current cases of human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense are in low-income countries with a reported gross national income of roughly $400 per person annually , (The World Bank 2016) whereas cost- eectiveness thresholds for global investors are closer to $300 per DALY averted.(National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) International 2014) Page 134 of 321 It is important to note that these insights are based on a limited number of strategies, for which results reflect the synergies of the input parameters a vailable: in specic situations, current methods could well be adequate. For instance, elimination of human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense in Equatorial Guinea (Luba, Bioko Island) focused on a screen -and- treat campaign mechanism.(Simarro et al. 2006) Furthermore, our results show that addition of active biennial surveillance in low transmission areas would be a cost- eective option, leading to elimination at less than $150 per DALY averted. Findings of eld studies and modelling exercises (Tirados et al. 2015; Courtin et al. 2015; Pandey et al. 2015; Rock et al. 2015; de Vries et al. 2016) have conrmed our work, also showing that surveillance and treatment in combination with vector control can inte rrupt transmission in a shorter time span than can screen -and-treat campaigns alone. However, our analysis also examines the economic outcomes of these strategies, showing that although the cost- eectiveness of adding tiny targets will vary by setting, red ucing vector control maintenance costs or varying surveillance coverage rates in combination with tiny targets could improve cost -eectiveness in high transmission areas while still possibly reaching elimination targets. Many aspects of T b gambiense epide miology remain elusive. For example, in recent years, the implications of asymptomatic carriers,(Bucheton et al. 2011; Welburn et al. 2016) potential animal res ervoirs for human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense ,(Bucheton et al. 2011) case r eports of congenital transmission,(Lindner & Priotto 2010) systematic non - compliance of at -risk subgroups, (Wel burn et al. 2016; Bilonda Mpiana et al. 2015) and the part played by vectors (Welburn et al. 2016) have been considered or reconsidered. Changes to available evidence could potentially aect optimum elimination strategies, because our model assumes that animal reservoirs do not contribute signicantly to transmission of T b gambiense, (Chris M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) that asymptomatic carriers are suciently rare in their occurrence, (Checchi et al. 2008) that vectors do transmit T b gambiense, and that sexual transmission is infrequent. If additional evidence to the contrary becomes available, new mode lling studies should be developed to assess the eect that these novel insights into the epidemiology of human African trypanosomiasis might have on elimination goals. Our assessments of new technologies have been made in the hope that the foreseen molecules would reach the market. Fexinidazole is now in phase 3 trials, (Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) 2014a) with new studies for stage 2 human African trypanosomiasis in adults Page 135 of 321 and children. Findings of interim analyses show that fexinidazole is on track to come to the market, with a high possibility that it might be available for both stages of the disease in 2019.(Jones & Avery 2015) Furthermore, results from the one -way sensitivity analysis also showed that if oxaborole compounds fail to reach the market, fexinidazole in combination with new diagnostic m ethods would still be a cost -eective alternative likely to lead to elimination. Assuming that the oxaborole compound SCYX -7158 becomes available in the near future as a safe, single -dose oral compound, elimination becomes highly feasible and could possibl y be considered as a tool for mass drug administration to prevent resurgence in areas that have high exposure rates to infected vectors. There is also uncertainty surrounding the sensitivity and specicity of current and emerging diagnostic tests, because diagnostic accuracy is related directly to prevalence and to identication by the diagnostic test of antibodies that the hosts produce. These diculties within diagnostic methods have also hindered research and development of a rapid diagnostic test that c an dierentiate stages of disease, meaning that lumbar puncture might be necessary for a longer time than once hoped. Economic concerns still remain because emerging technologies might also need a change in the health- care structure of aected countries. A lthough our analysis assesses the cost- eectiveness of strategies, nancing for a chosen strategy and assessing the budget eect that an elimination campaign would have on the current allotted scal space of decision makers are both necessary for global co mmitments towards elimination to be sustained. (Lee et al. 2015) The indirect costs to society also need to be assessed because new treatments and reduced transmission will decrease potential out -of-pocket expenditures for aected families (Matemba et al. 2010) and reduce productivity losses for aected individuals. Moreover, reduction of tsetse flies could potentially aord communities access to land currently not inhabited, cultivated, or used for alter native economic gains. (Radio New Zealand 2015) Progress reports for elimination show that c ases of human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense are on the decline, (Simarro et al. 2015) which is a tribute to the concerted eorts of the global community working towards elimination of this disease. However, there are still populations living in at -risk areas not under surveillance. This situation calls for continued and swift diusion of upcoming interventions in the pipeline acr oss sub -Saharan Africa to Page 136 of 321 further accelerate the decline of human African trypanosomiasis transmission and to ensure that 2020 targets and beyond become a reality. 5.6 Research in context Evidence before this study Eorts to estimate the nancial resources nee ded for elimination of neglected tropical diseases have been done by WHO and collaborations including Uniting to Combat NTDs and The Lancet Commission on Investing in Health. Furthermore, in 2015 and 2016, several researchers used modelling exercises to investigate the probability of elimination with available interventions in west and central Africa. However, a full economic assessment o f multiple interventions for human African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei (T b) gambiense has not been attempted. Building on our previous work, in which we identified and considered new technologies as potential strategies to achieve elimination, we used a modelling approach to assess the cost -effectiveness and the probability of elimination of five interven tion strategies. Added va lue of this analysis Our analysis shows that potential additional gains can be made with emerging technologies, particularly short or single -dose oral treatments (fexinidazole and the oxaborole compound SCX -7158), rapid diagnostic tests, and tiny targets. We also addressed trade -offs between costs, health effects and elimination timelines that need to be considered by decision makers. Additionally, our results indicate that strategic planning for elimination campaigns should be tailored to suit the transmission situation of a given focus. Implications of all the available evidence The results presented in this report harmonise the contributions of current and emerging technologies that will be available to eliminate sleeping sickness and show good value for money, hence providing national sleeping sickness control programmes and glo bal funders Page 137 of 321 with evidence -based solutions for the elimination of human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense. 5.7 Contributors CSS, CMS, and FT designed the study.

It is hoped that elimination of HAT Tbg would assist in this goal, but the financial estimates to do this are still unknown. The objectives of this analysis are: 1) forecast the financial cost of control and elimination programs; and 2) estimate the risk to poverty by assessing financial protection. Methods In order to estimate the total costs to health services and individuals: 1) potential elimination programs were defined; 2 ) the direct costs of programs was calculated; and 3) the per case out- of-pocket payments (OOPs) by program and financial risk protection indicators were estimated. Unit prices were converted in International Dollars (USD) using purchasing power parity (PP P) listed in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database and discounted at 3%. The mean results for both direct program costs and OOPs were calculated from a number of simulations and reported along with 95% confidence intervals. Total costs per program were reported for the financial program costs. Proportions of catastrophic health expenditures at 10% and 25% were reported for OOPs related to HAT Tbg. Results Across sub -Saharan Africa, HAT Tbg maintaining \"Control\" would lead to a decline in cases and cost $630M. In comparison, the cost of \"Elimination\" programs ranged from $410.9M to $1.2 billion. Maintaining \"Control\" would continue to cause impoverishment and CHEs to households; while all Elimination programs would lead to significant reductions. Conclus ion Overall, the total costs of either control or elimination programs would be near 1 billion USD in the next decade. However, only elimination programs will reduce the number of cases and improve financial risk protection for households who are impacted by HAT Tbg. Page 140 of 321 6.2 Introduction Over the last two decades, global health expenditures per capita have more than doubled, and continue to increase annually.(World Health Organization n.d.) In several countries a large proportion of the health expenditure is funded by patients out- of-pocket with severe consequences to the financial protection of the household. Y et policy makers at all levels rarely take into account the potential consequences on a household's economic conditions of health policies and interventions. In the last decade, Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) increasingly attracted the interested of gl obal health investors and there is currently a global mandate to achieve disease elimination of several NTDs. (Uniting to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases 2016) In order to comprehensively define the economic implications for NTDs in particular for key stakeholders, an \"E radicati on\" or \"E limination Investmen t Case\" (EIC) framework was developed. (Tediosi et al. 2013) At present, this approach has been applied to onchocerciasis (\"river blindness\") and lymphatic filariasis (LF, \"elephantiasis\"), highlighting that investments in elimination or eradication of such diseases leads to economic, health and ethical benefits. (Kastner et al. 2015; Stone et al. 2016; Kastner et al. 2017; Kastner e t al. 2016; Kim, Remme, et al. 2015; Kim, Sicuri, et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2017; Bailey et al. 2015) Thus far, cost - effective elimination strategies for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T.b. g). have been identified,(Sutherland et al. 2017) and the ethical considerations of each strategy have been formally assessed ( Merritt et al, under review ); however, a summary of the direct costs required for national control and elimination programs have yet to be ascertained. HAT T.b.g, also known as \"sleeping sickness\" is caused by the presence of the T .b.g parasite that is transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly from human reservoirs. (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) Symptoms of the disease in the early stages include fever, headaches, joint pain and itching (Uniting to Combat NTDs n.d.) ; however, second stage symptoms resemble more severe neurological elements as the parasite eventually crosses the blood brain barrier. Affected individuals in the second stage may display behaviours similar to that of a patient with mental illness leading to societal rejection, disdain and isolation even after the disease has been treated and the patient recovers.(Mpanya et al. 2012) Although several Sub -Saharan nations have tsetse inhabited areas with the potential of transmitting T.b. gambiense, current ly there are 14 endemic countries that still reported having HAT cases in Page 141 of 321 2013(Jose R Franc o et al. 2014) with Ghana having one case in 2014 after several years of being case free (Jose R Franco et al. 2014) . Patients infected with the disease are traditionally required to undergo a chemotherapy regimen at treatment centres that are accessible but often far from the villages of those most affected (Simarro et al. 2014) . This requires that patients be away from their families and absent from occupational obligations post -treatment resulting in financ ial consequences. (Mpanya et al. 2012) Recent technological developments in treatments, surveillance approaches and diagnostics, along with feasible vector control interventions (Steinmann et al. 2015) have shown that there are new alt ernatives to treat, identify and prevent g -HAT that are cost -effective; decision makers now need to calculate the annual and future budget implications to sustain elimination strategies, as well as consider the economic implications for the communities in volved. This manuscript aims to estimate the potential costs associated with these two perspectives. First, to forecast the financial imp act that elimination programs may need to sustain elimination targets; and secondly, to alert decision makers of the implications for financial risk protection to households affected by HAT T.b.g. 6.3 Methods In order to estimate the direct costs and societal impacts, the current control and potential elimination programs at a national level needed to be defined. Then for each program it is necessary to estimate the associated direct costs, households out of po cket payments and financial risk protection indicators. Our approach considers both the perspective of the national and global funders who are interested in the direct costs associated with HAT T.b.g. elimination (including health services and vector contr ol), and a societal perspective (i.e. out- of-pocket payments). Unit prices were converted in International Dollars (USD) using purchasing power parity (PPP) listed in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database. (International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2014) Prices that were reported in Euros were converted to International Dollars (USD) using the average exchange rates lists on the European Central Bank Statistical Data Warehouse. Once all costs were converted to USD, they were then inflated to 2013 dollars using average consumer price indices (CPI).(European Central Bank (Eurosystem) 2014) The mean results for both direct program costs and societal costs are calculated along with 95% CI are to express the uncertainty surrounding the mean simulations. Costs are discounted at 3% and reported from 2013 and 2020 for a time horizon of 7 years. Page 142 of 321 Defining control and potential elimination programs A priority setting exercise was undertaken in order to define optimal programs according to cost-effectiveness and probability of elimination based on a previously published economic evaluation for strategies including new technologies in the elimination of T.b. gamb iense (Sutherland et al. 2017) . The micro -strategies originated from potential approaches to elimination foreseen with technologies that became available in 2013 and onwards described in Steinmann et al (Steinmann et al. 2015) . The strategies range d from adding new tiny targets for vector control in addition to the current 'screen and treat' programs readily available, to including a new oral tablet ( i.e. oxaboroles ) treatment that may eliminate the need for prolonged in -hospital treatment. These were further combined in Sutherland et al in 2017(Sutherland et al. 2017) and modelled as five mutually exclusive macro -strategies for elimination to determine cost -effective options per foci. These macro -strategies for elimination were further categorized into national elimination programs, based on several cost - effectiveness thresholds. Each program is briefly described hereafter and within Table 12, with additional details for the approach provided i n appendix D.1 . Table 12. Description of programs for control and elimination Program Cost-effectiveness threshold Scenario description Control Reference In alignment with the EIC methodology (Tediosi et al) we use the \"control\" as the counterfactual scenario which equa tes to recommendations by the WHO during 2013: total reliance on passive reporting in low transmission areas, biennial screening in moderate areas and annual screening in high transmission with the screening and treatment of CATT and pentamidine (stage1)/NECT(stage 2) respectively. Elimination I ~$200 per DALY averted Involves the recommended surveillance levels for HAT by \"Control\", but switching to new technologies for treatment (fexinidazole and oxaboroles) and diagnostics (rapid diagnostics with motorbike screening campaigns) in all areas but not implementing vector control strategies including tiny targets Elimination II ~$700 per DALY averted Involves biennial surveillance in low risk transmission areas, currently recommended surveillance levels for HAT by WHO in moderate and high risk areas, switching to new technologies for treatment and diagnostics in all areas, and implementing vector contr ol strategies including tiny targets but only in high risk transmission areas Elimination III ~$150 0 per DALY averted Involves biennial surveillance in low risk transmission areas, currently recommended surveillance levels for HAT by WHO in moderate and h igh risk areas, switching to Page 143 of 321 new technologies for treatment and diagnostics in all areas, and implementing vector control strategies including tiny targets but only in moderate and high risk transmission areas *WHO surveillance recommendations: Low risk (no active surveillance, passive surveillance only), Moderate - biennial surveillance, High - annual surveillance Control In alignment with the EIC methodology (Tediosi et al) we use \"C ontrol\" as the counterfactual scenario which equates to recommendations by the WHO: total reliance on passive reporting in low transmission areas, biennial screening in moderate areas and annual screening in high transmission foci. T he screening and treatm ent include the trypanosomiasis respectively. Elimination I (~$200 per DALY averted) Involves currently recommended surveillance levels as defined by the WHO, switching to new technologies for treatment (fexinidazole and oxaboroles) and diagnostics (rapid diagnostics with motorbike screening campaigns) in all foci. Elimination II ( ~$700 per DALY averted ) Involves scaling up to biennial surveillance in low risk transmi ssion areas, currently recommended surveillance levels for HAT by WHO in moderate and high risk areas, switching to new technologies for treatm ent and diagnostics in all area. The deployment of tiny targets is included, but only in high risk foci. Elimina tion III( ~$1500 per DALY averted ) Involves scaling up to biennial surveillance in low risk transmission areas, maintaining the current recommendations of surveillance by WHO in moderate (biennial) and high risk areas (annual) , switching to new technologies for treatment and diagnostics in all areas, and implementing vector control strategies including tiny targets for both moderate and high risk transmission areas. Forecasting the financial impact of national programs A \"bottom -up approach\" was used to estimate the total sub -Saharan costs. A dynamical transmission model developed by Stone & Chitnis (Christopher M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) has been used previously to estimate long -term costs and effects for control and elimination Page 144 of 321 programs for HTA T.b.g.(Sutherland et al. 2017) . In o ur analysis, we exported the mean annual cost per person per foci (from 500 simulations) for each program related to: surveillance (including diagnostics), treatment and vector control. These per person estimates were then projected to estimate country rel ated costs based at risk populations areas (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) and finally aggregated for a cumulative cost across the 14 endemic sub -Saharan countries. The calculated estimations and methods for the programs and interventions are provided in appendix D.2 . Forecasting financial protection (financial protection analysis (FPA)) The estimated number of cases in 2013 was 6228 by Franco et al (Franco et al. 2017) and, b ased on the four aforementioned programs for contr ol and elimination, the number of expected cases was proj ected across sub -Saharan Africa, again using the model published by Stone and Chitnis (Chris M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) . It was assumed that each estimated Tbg case would represent a single household. A financial risk protection analysis (FPA) model was built in MS Excel 2010, and used Bayesian sampling techniques to estimate the household related data required for the FPA including: income, non -medical (NM) expenses (i.e. food) and medical expenses (i.e. out -of-pocket payments (OOP)). The median income of $1360 per annum was derived from the average gross national income (GNI) of the 13 endemic nations impacted by Tbg, with costs of non -medical expenses (i.e. food) derived from the literature (Depetris Chau vin et al. 2012; Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007b) . The total medical expenses paid by households was estimated from HAT studies found in the literature as well. (Matemba et al. 2010) For t he purpose of this analysis, we assumed that 100% of affected households would actually incur medical expenses. The catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) was calculated using the proportion of medical expenses related to g -HAT from a household's total inc ome less a basic need (i.e. food). The proportions of CHE at 10% and 25% were reported as defined by the SDG 3.8.2.(Bank 2 017). A normal distribution was applied to case estimates, while gamma distributions were applied to all cost inputs. A poverty line (PL) of $1.9 per diem (Bank 2017) was used to account for the economic status of sub -Saharan Africa. It was assumed that the PL would be the same in 2013 and 2020. For each program, 10,000 simulations were run to generate the mean reported outcomes and 95% Confidence Intervals. To understand the potential impact of poverty with current and future technologies , the program \"Control 2013\" was used as a comparative baseline measure to the alternative options. The outcomes of the FPA are report ed across Sub -Saharan African and by country income levels. A full summary of the input parameters and calculations for the financial protection analysis are provided in appendix D.3 . Page 145 of 321 6.4 Results Financial impact From 2013 until 2020, the cumulative costs of control and elimination programs of the strategies modelled are listed in Table 13. The results demonstrate that maintaining the current control programs, without taking new technologies into consideration, will incur a total cost of $630.6 million (95% CI: $630.3 to $631.0 million) across sub -Saharan Africa. Introducing the first option of elimination programs (\"Elimination I\") leads to a total financial impact of $410.9 million (95% CI: $410.7 to $411.1 million); while scaling to yield total of $988.0 $987.6 to $988.5 million). Implementing \"Elimination III\" across all sub -Saharan nations would lead to a total cost of $1248.1 million (95% CI: $1247.2 to $1249.1 million). The net impact of each program in comparison to \"Control\" demonstrates that \"Elimination I\" would actually lead -219.6 million) for \"Elimination II\" and \"Elimination III\" respectively. When evaluating the proportion of health expenses further, 80 -87% of financial burden for g -HAT will allotted to low -income countries. In particular, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has the second lowes t income of all the endemic Su b-Saharan countries , but the highest number of cases, would be responsible for 65 -72% depending on the program selected. Furthermore, if affordability was being assessed using GNI levels, CAR, DRC, Guinea and Uganda would only be able to afford \"Elimination II\". For each program, as depicted in Figure 14, the majority of costs for control and elimination programs are driven by screening and diagnostic costs that come passive, and/or active screening campaigns (68- 90% of total costs). The ongo ing costs for control also begin to plateau after several years; while, although the costs of elimination programs are high in the earlier years, they decline to 3- 5% of the overall costs in later years. The additional cost of vector control to \"Eliminatio n II\" and \"Elimination III\" programs contribute to 9% and 29% of the total program costs respectively. Page 146 of 321 Figure 14.

Overall, in comparison to the baseline year 2013, maintaining a similar \"Control\" program till 2020 will not have an impact on poverty indices. Although the number of cases may decline, the OOP health expenditures related to attending treatment centres fo r HAT treatment will still lead to impoverishment (22%), immiserization (31%) and catastrophic health expenditures at both 10% and 25% of HAT Tbg households. Scaling up to \"Elimination\" programs, that result in medications that can be taken at home or wit hin local villages, will reduce the risk of impoverishment in the future by at least 5% for all elimination programs in comparison to control and reduce the number of households facing CHEs to less than 1%. In addition, \"Elimination\" programs lead to the f ewest number of forecasted cases in the future. This dual impact is on households with Tbg is shown in the series of Pen's Parade diagrams illustrated in Figure 15. Unfortunately, the reduction of OOP will not end poverty completely. Additional FPAs were evaluated by country income levels (Refer to Table 3). The results again demonstrate that the LICs would be the most vulnerable to OOPs with 99.4% and 98.8% of the households experiencing CHEs at 10% and 25% respectively if \"Control\" is maintained. Pursuing \"Elimination\" programs would reduce the number of households facing CHEs to less than 1%. In addition, although at first glance it appears that ther e are fewer being impoverished, this is only due to the fact that the majority of the households in LICs will risk immiserization (approximately 85%) for healthcare payments related to HAT, even with \"Elimination\" programs. LMICs have smaller populations of households at risk of impoverishment (0.49%) and CHEs when \"Control\" is in place, however; introducing \"Elimination\" programs could also eliminate CHEs and reduce the proportion of those impoverished to less than 0.5%. There is not foreseen risk to pove rty related to HAT Tbg expenditures in UMICs. Page 149 of 321 Table 14.

Elimination II 2020 Page 151 of 321 6.5 Discussion Across sub -Saharan Africa, HAT T.b.g control and elimination programs will require substantial funding and fiscal commitments over the coming years. A \"Control\" program will lead to fewer cases in the coming years, but will still cost millions of dollars to funders and have no impact on reducing poverty indices encouraged by the SDGs. Moving to \"Elimination\" is an attractive option, but the \"Eliminati on\" programs that are most likely to reduce cases and alleviate OOPs related to g -HAT (Elimination II and III), may not be affordable for LICs that share the greatest burden of at risk communities. In addition, the majority of the funding required will nee d to be allocated to in -country surveillance and diagnostics annually, while traditionally for HAT only the treatments have been donated with the majority of the healthcare costs reliant on NGOs and national fragile health systems. The results of this two -part analysis demonstrate that there is a need to prepare substantial funds for elimination, not only for treatments and preventative measures (i.e. vector control) but also to the health system itself. In addition, it has demonstrated that the strive to elimination programs may alleviate the risk of impoverishment and thus contributing to reach the millennial SDGs. The results of th e analysis on financial burden highlight that \"Eliminat ion\" programs are the most favourable in achieving global goals. How ever decision makers will have to assess the fiscal space needed especially since availability of new HAT treatments has historically had delays in Pan -African uptake in the market. There may be a risk that LICs will opt for the less aggressive \"Eliminatio n I\" program, but this will not lead to a slower decline in cases compared to other elimination options. In addition, to offset the costs of surveillance that are the main driver of these programs, community health workers or volunteers may be enlisted. Again, as in other NTD efforts, this may alleviate direct costs, but increase productivity losses. In addition, HAT is not the only NTD ear -marked for elimination/eradication, and so it must be kept in mind that there is still competition for funds even tho ugh the costs of elimination are known. For instance, the pan -African costs for HAT elimination programs range from $0.42 to $1.24 billion , while world -wide onchocerciasis elimination and eradication programs are estimated to be $2.7 and $2.9 billion respe ctively. (Kim, Sicuri, et al. 2015) This may pose a challenge for HAT during prioritization of funding for NTDs. For example, the onchocerciasis, eradication and elimination programs are cost -saving relative to control and the per person at risk cost for HAT remains a relatively costly disease with programs ranging from $3 to $10 per person annually compar ed to ranges of $1.5 to $3.9 per treatment in the onchocerciasis programs. (Kim, Sicuri, et al. 2015) Page 152 of 321 HAT T.b. gambiense is already known to be a disease that affects the poor, but the current results demonstrate that households who are already near the poverty line, may fall: closer to the poverty line, under the poverty line (impoverished), or further i nto poverty (immiserized). However, the results of this analysis are still conservative as, recent evidence shows that there are often additional expenses prior to the diagnosis of HAT as households seek alternative care and guidance when family members ar e ill.(Bukachi et al. 2017) Although the methodology for poverty assessments using household surveys has been established (Wagstaff & van Doorslaer 2003; Bank 2017) , the approach of modelling prospectively to understand its impact on future technologies within an EIC is novel. The financial protection analysis presented here is also not based on household surveys and instead relies on secondary data and modelling to generate conclusions . However , it demonstrates the potential to provide useful information in a decision making context for new technologies . In addition, the FPA does not address other societal costs, such as the loss of wages (productivity) , which has be en done within an eradication investment case for other neglected diseases. (Stone et al. 2016; Kim , Sicuri, et al. 2015) These costs have recently been estimated along with other NTDs for elimination by Lenk et al., and demonstrate that the contribution of productivity loss to HAT is substantial.(Lenk et al. 2018) There are also economic gains from elimination that could also be considered in future EIC assessments. For instance, tsetse free areas may increase access to water areas without menace and even land use opportunities. The concept of addressing both positive and negative impacts to households related to disease expenditures has been recently explored in observance of non -communicable diseases in Bangladesh. (Mirelman et al. 2016) Future research in prospective FPA could also consider if and how additional income to at risk communities ( i.e. households) that may result from elimination and assist to offset OOPs related to CHEs. Although this analysis highlights the financial benefits of elimination programs, at the time of its inception, it was assumed that novel interventions would arrive on the market as scheduled. The efficacy of fexinidazole has been proven (Mesu et al. 2018) however it still awaits European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval as of January 2018. (Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) 2018) In addition, previous modelling (Sutherland et al. 2017) estimated the arrival of a novel one time treatment in 2018, while it is currently estimated to be submitted to the EMA in 2021.(Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) 2017) In the interim, s ubsidies for travel, accommodation and food could be considered, with the current national sleeping sickness control programs (NSCCPs) to encourage patients to attend without Page 153 of 321 the ris k of poverty. Nonetheless, the scale up of elimination activities has begun in at least nine endemic nations,(FIND n.d.) and there is a continual decline in cases supporting the model's estimations. Our results also assume 80% coverage is maintained for surveillance programs. This coverage rate shows promise in leading to elimination but may be hard to achieve . Although 30% of the high transmission areas are covered, on average, only 2% of the continent is experiencing some level of screening. Furthermore, there are several countries that have not established formal NSCCPs (i.e. Gambia, Guinea -Bissau, Liberia ), although foci risk areas exist. (Franco et al. 2017) Hence, the scale up to elimination will be substantial not only in funds, but f or logistics on the ground. Scaling up coverage may reveal also that there are more cases than once thought, and adjustments to the elimination forecast and budgets will have to be made. Long -term commitments to funding post -elimination will be needed as t he possibility of asymptomatic cases and unknown reservoirs comes to the forefront. An example of this was seen recently in Ghana where one case was found in 2013 after 12 years of no cases being reported. Conclusion Overall, the results demonstrate that an \"Elimination II\" foci -specific program that deploys : targets in high risk areas with annual surveillance, adopts new technologies in all areas and implements biannual surveillance in moderate and low transmission zones, remains within cost-effectivenes s thresholds for some low and lower -middle income countries. It could also achieve elimination goals for 2020 in the long -run and leads to financial protection for families impacted by HAT T.b.g. Global stakeholders and funders should ensure that low incom e countries whose national sleeping sickness control programs ( NSCCPs ) are unable to secure funds nationally for elimination should be supported as they share a disproportionate load of the disease burden. The elimination of HAT T.b.g. does have a high cost, but with continued efforts and support from global stakeholders, it is hoped that those already at risk of poverty will not be the ones to pay it.

Simone Sutherland, MSc1,2 & Fabrizio Tediosi, PhD*1,2, 1Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Socinstrasse 57, 4002 Basel, Switzerland 2University of Basel, P.O. Box, CH -4003 Basel, Switzerland Working paper Page 157 of 321 7.1 Abstract Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), commonly known as 'sleeping sickness', is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Knowing the restrictions that the diagnostic and treatment paradigm for HAT incurs, researchers for HAT Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) gambiense encourage the adoption of new technologies that will improve chances of health systems integration. Taking on a health systems thinking approach, this paper aims to describe the systemic implications of moving from a non -integrated to integrated system, a nd to use health systems modelling to determine if future integrated approaches could be of use if analysed prior to implementation. In the context of sleeping sickness integration will change the health systems approach that active surveillance programs h ave relied on for the last century. The main changes in the system scaling up to elimination will be seen at the local and national level as the burden of care will shift to countries. Using modelling to simulate potential impacts could provide useful information to decision makers at the national level in order for them to anticipate which changes need to be addressed to maximize capacity and ensure that HAT patients do not go untreated. Integration is an inevitable change that will be needed for sustainable healthcare systems and autonomy for nations that have had healthcare services managed by external collaborators for decades. Careful planning and consideration using systems thinking and modelling analyses can help decision makers to contain th e processes as they occur and it is hoped that these approaches can be used as an option for decision makers to evaluate anticipated changes more critically. Page 158 of 321 7.2 Backgrounds Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) targeted f or elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Detection of HAT currently relies on vertical surveillance programs where patients are identified in their villages or self -report to specialized health centres, and endure delays in waiting for confirmati on of laboratory tests and further results in large out- of-pocket payments ( Sutherland 2016, under development ). Knowing the restrictions that the diagnostic and treatment paradigm for HAT incurs, researchers for gambiense HAT encourage the adoption of new technologies that will improve chances of health systems integration.(Palmer 2012; Burri 2014; Lejon et al. 2013) Hence as new technologies become available, understanding the benefits and/or consequences of integration need to be fully evaluated. An EIC investment case for HAT (Tediosi et al. 2013) has used dynamical modelling to evaluate the long- term cost-effectiveness of new technologies ,(Sutherland et al. 2017) forecast elimination, assess financial and socio -economic implications; 8 and assess ethical impacts; however, the operational feasibility of such interventions has not yet been ascertained. Health system modelling has proven t o be useful in several examples in literature in evaluating the operational constraints that changes in health service delivery may have on the systems components (Pilgrim et al. 2008; Pilgrim & Chilcott 2007; Lim et al. 2013) . In addition, modellers wo rking on NTDs also recognize the need to not only address the transmission components of infectious disease, but how campaigns and strategies towards elimination will operate on the field.(Hollingsworth et al. 2015) It is proposed that the integration of programs into the local health centres could be mode lled to forecast outcomes related to capacity, service delivery and even perhaps estimate the level of diagnostic proficiency that would be necessary from the health care workforce to sustain elimination efforts. Taking on a holistic thinking method comm only practised in health systems thinking, the first part of this paper aims to discuss the components of the current system, along with potential integration that is predicted to be feasible with new interventions arriving on the market. Secondly, using a simple health systems model, scenarios will be simulated at the local setting 8 Chapter 6. Sutherland & Tediosi Page 159 of 321 to determine if future integrated approaches can be tested for benefits or losses prior to implementation. 7.3 Overview of health systems in the context of Gambiense HAT 'Control' of Gambiense HAT in relation to the health s ystem To understand the current context of HAT within the health system, and overview of the present day events were compartmentalized into the six building blocks of the health system.(de Savigny & Adam 2009) This evidence was gathered from the most recent global stakeholders meeting for Gambiense HAT elimination (Sutherland 2016) and are summarized in Figure 24 with further details listed in Appendix H . In regards to the delivery of medical services for HAT, the approach is quite vertical and with the main governance coming from MSF and the NSSCP with little involvement from the local health care system although this is expandin g(Sutherland 2016; Simarro et al. 2014) . As outlined in the supply chain delivery diagram in Figure 25A., the current approach to providing treatment relies on the countries requesting medication through the WHO and then in turn the treatment supplies being provided to the countries after WHO has procured the items from the pharmaceutical companies. Although WHO recommends NECT as the appropriate stage two treatments for HAT, the nifurotomix tablets are used off - label and hence the countries take the sole responsibility for this. This requires some regulatory clearance from the WHO and countries pri or to the drug being available. It should be noted that melarsoprol is still used in some areas when there are treatment failures. The supplies are then delivered to MSF who distributes them to the appropriate programs. Aside from the NSCCP that operate un der the MoH in affected nations, the operations of HAT control are quite peripheral to the system. MSF operates their own sleeping sickness supply chain, surveillance and treatment centres - and although they work in collaboration with the national program s, they are essentially an independent entity. A large number of actors in regards to financing come from the western hemisphere and the same trend are true for those involved research and development activities (R&D). However, countries with national prog rams within their Ministry of Health (MoH) receive country funding; and vector control initiatives are also often funding at the country level within Page 160 of 321 agriculture departments. (Sutherland 2016) Those participating in the countries are the people and community themselves along with the local health care workforce, natio nal sleeping sickness control programs (NSCCP) and treatment centres in the at risk nations. The current paradigm does not incorporate community health workers to treat disease as the medical expertise to diagnose and treat HAT is quite specialized. Figur e 16.

Governance, finance and information appears to Page 161 of 321 remain the same current funders are still committed to support HAT programs (Sutherland 2016) , but realizing the substantial efforts and financial resources that elimination will bring, there may be a need fo r new funders to come aboard. Also with the integration of new personnel and the national systems, the ministries of health of the nations involved will be required to play a stronger role in the governance. Changes for service delivery are also highlighte d in Figure 17B. The diagnostics and medical treatments although simpler to disseminate will continue to come from abroad, which may still impose challenges in health service delivery that are seen in count ries with war zones and in adequate transport routes to isolated areas, especially during rainy seasons(USAID 2009) . The hope for integration is that with rapid diagnostic test and oral tablets, HA T will be a 'normal disease' (Burri 2014; Sutherland 2016) and tasks for diagnosis and treatment can be shifted to community health workers and/or the local workforce through training initiatives .(Bukachi et al. 2005; Palmer 2012) Tiny targets are also easier to deploy that their larger predecessors and several studies have shown that community involvement in vector control interventions is feasible.(Kovacic et al. 2013; Sutherland 2016) . Taking into consideration that new diagnostics, treatments and vector prevention tools are hoped to be deployed in a non -vertical manner; the greatest changes from the systems perspective for integration will be within countries in relation to service delivery and health workforce. Page 162 of 321 Figure 17. Overview of service delivery for HAT diagnostics and treatment A. Current control(specialized, non -integrated) B. Potential elimination (fully integrated) Page 163 of 321 7.4 Potential analytical approach for systems integration From systems perspective, adoption of new interventions will impact the health care workforce and health service delivery the most of integration is to move forward. Knowing this, one can develop a simp le system to reflect the current scenario, and then model alternative scenarios to evaluate the impact on the system. Models to demonstrate operation concerns have been used form health systems to replicate systems dynamics (Windisch et al. 2011) , supply chain management (Assi et al. 2011; Alfonso et al. 2012; Spiliotopoulou et al. 2013) and patient interactions with services while in the system . (Pilgrim et al. 2008; Pilgrim & Chilcott 2007; Lim et al. 2013) Control versus elimination scenarios Potential scenarios of current and new technologies coming available (Steinmann et al. 2015) were presented 2014, and were further evalu ated for cost -effectiveness,9 financial expenditures and OOPs10 driven by a dynamical transmission model (Christopher M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) . As an example, only t hree situations were considered as depicted outlined in Table 15 focusing control as a non -integrated system and elimination scenarios as integrated treatment options. Table 15. Scenarios modelled for integrated and non -integrated health systems Scenario Health system structure Description Control Non -integrated Self-reporting patients may go to a local health centre first or may decide to go directly to specialise HAT tre atment centre for diagnosis. Regardless of where patient presents with symptoms, treatment is done with pentamidine for stage 1 or NECT for stage 2 at the specialized treatment centre. 9 Chapter 5.

Elimination 2019 Fully integrated Patient self -reports to any centre and can receive diagno sis and treatment immediately regardless of stage with oxaborole. Modelling the health system In order to envision the potential implications of health system integration for HAT, a discrete - event simulation (DES) health systems model has been developed using SIMUL8\u00ae. (Sutherland et al. 2014) The model inter -arrival time was parameterized to simulate 100,000 patients (refer to appendix E.2) over a one year time horizon (passive reporting only) with a prevalence of 1.61%, 0.112%, 0.020% to represent foci of high, moderate and low transmission according to the thresholds indicated by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) . The hypothetical village had access to three health centres containing different resources and capacity as presented in Figure 18. This structure was based on evidence from mapping efforts in the DRC that show that there are often several local centres closer to villages prior to reaching a specialized HAT treatment centre (refer to appendix E.3). Data inputs for the model were estimated based on t he literature, grey literature, national program reports and clinical trial site characteristics11 with the majority of evidence originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Two types of health systems were modelled: A \"Non -Integrated HS\" where patients could report to local centres but would be referred to HAT Centres for treatment versus a n \"Integrated HS\" where patients could be screened and treated at any centre . The model considers components related to time (e.g. treatment time, etc.) and probability of events occurring (e.g. patient's reporting to a health centre, etc.). Details regarding the input parameters are available in Table 16. 11 Information regarding staff resources at clinical trial sites in DRC were provided by MedRes, SwissTPH Page 165 of 321 Figure 18. Discrete event simulation (DES ) model in Simul8\u00ae for health systems servicing Gambiense HAT It was assumed in the model that patients that report to health centres with HAT and were not diagnosed (false negatives) went untreated . The main outcome evaluated was the number of patients treated and time that the patients spent in the 'health systems' . This model only looks at self -reporting to the health system and not those who may have been d etected by an active surveillance campaign and are now arriving at a centre for treatment. It assumes that patients will receive treatment soon after diagnosis. Model assumes that patients will be able to access a health facility once they have made the de cision to 'self -report' travel. Hence road delays or turning back from war torn zones is not taken into account in the current version of the model. Model structure permits one to evaluate patient's accessibility (includes desire to seek treatment, geograp hic nearness of health facility and way to reach health facility (time, method of transportation, etc.) and the availability of being able to get the health services that they seek once they have accessed the health centre. (Levesque et al. 2013) In this case outcomes of number of patients treated, time spent in the system and wait times were measured. A sensitivity analysis (SA) was conducted by examining low and high values for the mean distribution of the probability of self -reporting, the diagnostic accuracy of the healthcare centre 1 (HC 1 ) and healthcentre 2 ( HC 2 ), prevalence to examine the impa ct on the number of patients treated.

However, in areas with transmission over 1%, integration increases by 87% (fexinidazole); and improves a further 90% when oxaborole is introduced in 2019.(Refer to Figure 19) Page 167 of 321 Figure 19. Number of patients treated in the system by risk transmission area Seeing that the variation of patients treated was highest when transmission ri sk is high, a sensitivity analysis was done for this focus specifically. The results listed in Table 17 demonstrate that in a non -integrated system, the prevalence rat es have little impact as it appears that the current system is likely acting at capacity in a high transmission area. Improving diagnostic accuracy and encouraging patients in combination with integrated treatments reaches more patients. Although decreases in prevalence will open up space in the health system, foci with high transmission or areas experiencing outbreaks would be better handled with an integrated system. Table 17.

In the context of sleeping sickness, this is especially true as new interventions providing room for integrati on will change the health systems approach that active surveillance programs have relied on for the last century. (Steverding 2008) The main changes in the system scaling up to elimination will be seen at the local and national level as the burden of care will shift to countries. Using modelling to simulate potential impacts could provide useful information to decision makers at the national level in order for them to anticipate which changes need to be addressed to maximize capacity and ensure that HAT patients do not go untreated. For instance the current modelling results show that in high risk foci, adopting new technologies in an integrated system while improving patient self -reporting and health care workers to correctly identify patients leads to hig hest number of patients treated. Although this approach has provided a framework for thinking about health system changes in moving towards elimination there are still several issues to be addressed. Are we ready to lose 'control'? The goal of integration seems desirable however ; there are still concerns , that the current infrastructure of the nations burdened with HAT , may not be ready. Examples from the past including supply chain integration efforts in Mozambique (USAID DELIVER PROJECT 2012) show that the transfer of responsibilities can lead to inefficiency if not addressed prior to implementation. Also, risk associated with shifting the responsibility of distribution of treatments to national medical stores needs to also ensure that the donated interventions reach the patients and are not lost to corrupt processes. As fexinadzole in tablet form is already available in online as Winthrop\u00ae , countries will need to maintain regulatory processes so that sub-standard or counterfeit tablets lacking the active ingredient do not proliferate the market. The consequences of ignoring this will only lead to delays in elimination and increase financial and societal costs associated with the disease burden . Delivery approaches to tools also needs to be taken into consideration with a bit of creativity at hand. It has already been proposed that motorbike carriers are sufficient to deliver rapid diagnostic te sts and oral tablets (Sutherland 2016) , but considering alternative transportation mechanism such as Page 169 of 321 helicopters ( Burri, personal communication) or drones ( Awoonor -Williams , personal communication ) to isolated areas could prove to be useful in remotes areas across sub -Saharan Africa. There is also a need to think over maintaining a consistent supply of tools in areas experiencing civil conflict or war where routine deliveries may not be feasible. Looking for local storage with the new technologies, as is done with long lasting insectide net (LLINs) for malaria ,(Roll Back Malaria n.d.; Roll Back Malaria n.d.) could be adopted for integration as there will be no need for a cold chain. As demonstrated in this overview, the people involved in HAT treatment and the at risk populations themselves will play a larger role if integration is to come to pass. This may prove to be difficult since as cases dwindle motivation and opportunities to train and treat staff are difficult. (Sutherland 2016) People with experience in HAT near to larger hospitals may be able to transfer expertise in chemotherapy over to oncology if possible , or move into areas of animal trypanosomiasis where understa nding of the parasite is transferable. This paper has focused on gambiense HAT integration in the health system, however gambiense HAT is small component of the health system in sub -Saharan Africa that are burdened also with malaria, HIV, NCDs and other NT Ds to name a few. NTD programs often operate in specialized silos, but with the context of moving towards MDGs of sustainability in health systems, a systems thinking approach would be valuable in also assessing combined NTD programs and the ability of the health care workforce to appropriate differentiate between the plethoras of symptoms that patients present themselves with. Integrating HAT programs with other NTD programs may encourage interest, and training with the new diagnostics as well as disease differentiation could help motivate interest and will improve accuracy of syndromic algorithms.(Palmer 2012) Community health workers (CHW) will be encouraged to take on a larger role, but as various vertical NTD programs are happening simultaneously, this may be too much pressure or workload on communities . Integra ting NTD programs without losing the quality and community relationships that successful programs hav e instilled needs to be addressed. Communication between the NSSCP and communities will also be crucial. Encouraging patient self -reporting at health care facility may happen inadvertently when communities become aware that the new interventions are less invasive to diagnose and have simpler routes for treatment. P assive health care approaches should be sensitive to Page 170 of 321 community preferences (Palmer 2012; Mpanya et al. 2015; Mpanya et al. 2012) and ethical consideration wil l be further evaluated elsewhere. In regards to information for the health care system, thus far the WHO has the most information as it collects data fr om all the NSSCPs and has also combined efforts with FAO to identify at risk transmission areas and locations of health facilities using spatial information (Pere P Simarro et al. 2012; Simarro et al. 2014) However, this information is not always publically available and is limited as not all areas are under surveillance, hence the global stakeholders s hould consider who to harmonise data in order to accurately track elimination progress as integration rolls- out. There are several institutions and financiers involved in HAT, but as integration will bring on new entities for service delivery and the heal th care workforce, there do not seem to be new donors or funding avenues on the horizon. As elimination for HAT ensues and steps towards integration are made additional funds will be required. For instance, in addition to elimination costs that are already estimated to be millions annually for HAT (Seddoh et al. 2013) 12 increasing the community health workforce will also come at a cost (McCord et al. 2013; Singh & Sachs 2013) . In order to avoid 'donor fatigue' , again combining HAT with other N TD programs or beginning to seeking alternative funding mechanisms will also be inevitable. Although from economic and business level perspective program integration and alternative funding sources this seems logical, the changes that may be thrust upon th e current governing bodies if not done appropriately may hinder elimination efforts on the ground. This is yet another caveat to consider when thinking of integrative efforts for elimination. Being one step ahead of integration concerns Despite the antici pated concerns regarding moving to an integrated system in order to scale up control to elimination, modelling health systems provides an opportunity for decision makers to assess initiatives. This simple analysis focuses on three of the nine scenarios developed by Steinmann et al (Steinmann et al. 2015) , but there are also still alternative scenarios that could be run through the model. An example of this would be to vary parameters to evaluate how preventing access to one of the centres in the system (i.e. due to 12 Chapter 6. Sutherland & Tediosi Page 171 of 321 war or route unavailable in the rainy season) would impact treatment and to plan buffer stocks for such circumstances. As previously stated, building a model that evaluates 'combined' NTD programs or various diseases would also be of use. Planning for integration could also be done by varying the number of health centres available to treat HAT in the system to determine the minimum number of centres needed in an area to alleviate travel burden. Future health systems modelling eff orts could also include cost parameters so that the relative costs and even cost-effectiveness of programs for integration can be determined. While the results thus far have focused primarily on accessibility with time and location being the main adaptatio n of moving from a non -integrated to integrated system, issues associated with availability related to supply chain constraints and health care worker availability could be further manipulated in the model. Adding in medical supplies to the model could all ow national programs to estimate supplies and minimum stock levels required; and varying the number of health professionals available to treat could also be varied in the model to estimate the number of trained workers needed. There are also technical as pects to consider within discrete -event simulation (DES) models. For instance, with limited data available, f urther research will be needed to validate the outcomes using real -world evidence. There are also several assumptions made during this first iterat ion of model development that may impact outcomes if the model is to be used further. For instance, the model assumes that people treated immediately while in real life people may have to go home and wait for parasitological confirmation, and it does not t rack misdiagnosed individuals (i.e. false negatives, false positives) or repeated screeners. The model could be adapted to include this. There is also no consideration of uncertainty or consideration of how patients diagnosed with active surveillance inter act with the system. The benefits of using the Simul8\u00ae software allow decision makers to evaluate resource constraints related to staff and medical supplies but it remains difficult to incorporate disease transmission hence a dynamical model is still neede d for this component of assessing elimination. Further modelling efforts could work towards combining these components so that health resources and transmission can be analysed in unison. Page 172 of 321 7.6 Concluding remarks ' - Getting a grip' Integration is an inevitable change that will be needed for sustainable healthcare systems and autonomy for nations that have had healthcare services managed by external collaborators for decades. These changes may lead to a feeling of uncertainty, or 'losing control'. Careful planni ng and consideration using systems thinking and modelling analyses can help decision makers to contain the processes as they occur. In the context of an elimination investment case, it is important to see the operational challenges to be assessed not as an additional analysis to the EIC but maybe the most crucial. The funding will come, the drugs and diagnostics made - but if system is not properly prepared to treat patients, what good is it? The investments for elimination for neglected tropical diseases w ill require millions of dollars annually (Seddoh et al. 2013) and billions over the next few decades (Kim, Sicuri, et al. 2015) 13 and often fail to formally address the implementation pro cess, it is hoped that this approach can be used as an option for decision makers to evaluate anticipated changes more critically. 13 Chapter 6.

Ethical considerations for global health decision making: Justice -enhanced cost -effectiveness analysis of new technologies for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Public Health Ethics ,(under r eview ) Page 174 of 321 8.1 Summary We sought to assess formally the extent to which different control and elimination strategies for human African trypanosomiasis Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Gambiense HAT) would exacerbate or alleviate experiences of societal disadvantage that traditional economic evaluation doesn't take into account. Justice -Enhanced Cost -Effectiveness Analysis (JE -CEA) is a normative approach under development to address social justice considerations in publ ic health decision making alongside other types of analyses. It aims to assess how public health interventions under analysis in comparative evaluation would be expected to influence the clustering of disadvantage across 3 core dimensions of well -being: ag ency, association and respect. As a case study to test the approach, we applied it to 5 strategies for Gambiense HAT control and elimination, in combination with 2 different other evaluations: a cost- effectiveness analysis, and a probability of elimination analysis. We have demonstrated how JE -CEA highlights the ethical importance of adverse social justice impacts of otherwise attractive options and how it indicates specific modifications to policy options to mitigate such impacts. JE-CEA holds promise as a n approach to help decision makers and other stakeholders consider social justice more fully, explicitly, and systematically in evaluating public health programs. Page 175 of 321 8.2 Introduction In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a Roadmap to Elimination for several neglected tropical diseases ( (Cochi & Dowdle 2011; Thompson, 2011; Walker & Lupp n.d.) NTDs) (WHO 2012) . It was endorsed by global donors who signed the London Declaration targets for 2020 NTDs elimination (London Declaration 2013) . Since then, committed deci sion makers have struggled to assess formally the feasibility, costs, and consequences of eliminating or eradicating a target disease. In 2012, an investment case was proposed for 3 NTDs - onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and human African trypanosom iasis - to serve as a comprehensive analysis of clinically efficacious, feasible pathways to disease elimination or eradication, including required resources and operational investments (Tediosi et al. 2013) . This initiative deployed the eradication investment case (EIC) framework, developed expressly to support the use of traditional techniques of health and economic assessment in deliberations about whether to undertake elimination or eradication of candidate infectious diseases (Cochi & Dowdle 2011; Thompson, K. M., Rabinovich Rabinovich 2011; Walker & Lupp n.d.) . EIC components related to probability of elimination and cost -effectiveness have been assessed for onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and human African trypanosomiasis, but methods have been lacking to guide comparative assessment of broader social i mpacts across candidate elimination and eradication scenarios as called for by the EIC designers (Thompson, K. M., Rabinovich & Contch 2011; Walker & Rabinovich et al. 2017) . The EIC designers' conception of broader soc ial impacts encompasses not only effects on intergenerational justice and global health equity (Emerson 2011; Tediosi et al. 2013) , but also forms of psychological, psychosocial, and social impact that primarily affect people as subjects of personal life experience (Muela & Hausmann -Muela 2013; Tediosi et al. 2013) . We focus here on the need for a method to assess the latter, experiential forms of impact in the EICs for NTDs. In an effort to fill this gap in the cont ext of EICs for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, Bailey and colleagues (Bailey et al. 2015) first presented a method of ethical analysis informed by theories of social justice. As a pilot case, however, their discussion considered mainly the impacts attributable to the diseases, not to interventions, and did not Page 176 of 321 attempt a finer -grained comparison among different pathways toward the goal of disease elimination or eradication. Zwerling and colleagues (Zwerling et al. 2017) have built upon Bailey and colleagues' approach i n developing an innovative methodology called justice -enhanced cost -effectiveness analysis (JE -CEA). They have presented an initial proof -of-concept illustration , using a hypothetica l example (and moving outside of the NTD EICs discussion) specifically to suggest how JE -CEA might be used to compare novel vs. standard treatment regimens for multi -drug resistant tuberculosis (Zwerling et al. 2017) . The justice enhancement (JE) component of JE - CEA is intended to ass ess, alongside the results of cost -effectiveness analysis (CEA), the compared options' expected impacts upon patients' experiences of societal disadvantage, such as \"stigma, shame, social isolation, loss of agency and family strain \" (Zwerling et al. 2017) . In the present article, operating for the first time with a completed CEA and probability of elimination analysis (Sutherland et al. 2017) , we explore the adaptation of Zwerling and colleagues' JE- CEA methodology for use in the economic assessment of pathways to the elimination or eradication of NTDs, taking human African t rypanosomiasis Trypanosoma brucei gambiense as a salient NTD Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, HAT' for short, is one of 10 NTDs targeted for elimination by 2030 (WHO 2012; Uniting to Combat NTDs n.d.; World Health (WHO) . Gambiense an insect -borne parasitic infectious disease with at -risk areas spanning 24 African countries . Cases are currently being reported from 13 countries (Jose R Franco et al. 2014) . Gambiense HAT is most prevalent in low -income countries with the areas at risk encompassing mainly the poor rural population (Pere P Simarro et al. 2012) . It has 2 clinical manifestations as it progresses from a less acute to more severe stage . Stage 1 is a febrile illness; Stage 2 brings more severe symptoms, including disruption of the sleep -wake cycle, seizures, paralysis, weakness, confusion, psychosis , and eventual progression to coma and death if untreated (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) . Historically, disease control measures have focused on treatment of human cases to reduce the parasite reservoir , and, in some areas , vector control programs to reduce transmission (Bennett et al. 2016) . Page 177 of 321 A recent modelling study has compared the most promising Gambiense HAT elimination strategies in terms of cost -effectiveness an d probability of reaching elimination (Sutherland et al. 2017) . Although the disability -adjusted life -year (DALY) meas ure used in the cost- effectiveness analysis captures some disease -associated disability and mortality, the potential impacts of elimination strategies on the distribution of intervention -induced disadvantages like stigma and social exclusion have yet to be assessed (Sutherland et al. 2017) . 8.3 Normative approach Cost -effectiveness analysis (the CEA component of JE- CEA) is a prominent form of economic evaluation, a set of methods for comparative analysis often used to help prioritize budget -constrained resource allocation for public health program options (Drummond et al. 2005; Walker et al. 2011) . Norms of distributive justice are pervasively implicated in health - related uses of eco nomic evaluation, starting with the concern to consider opportunity costs in allocating limited public resources (Brock et al. 2017) . To deliberate on what would constitute an optimal use of resources in public health decision contexts, however, it's necessary also to consider ( inter alia) other applicable norms of distributive justice. One of these other norms is social justice. The concept of social justice invokes a \" moral imperative to avoid and remediate unfair distributions of societal disadvantage \" (Dukhanin et al. 2018; Faden & Shebaya 2016; Powers & Faden 2006; Wolff et al. 2007) . Social justice as a moral consideration is of major importance to public he alth and, in the economic evaluation of public health program options, it can either converge with or present trade -offs with comparably important moral considerations like the maximization of aggregate health benefit (Kass 2001; Childress et al. 2017) . Different conceptions of social just ice vary in their accounts of what societal disadvantage is and what makes for inequitable distributions of it. JE -CEA is an analytic technique designed for use by economic evaluators who seek to apply to the decision context at hand a certain conception o f social justice, which is centered on protecting and relieving people from severe societal disadvantage in multiple dimensions of well -being . Like other normative approaches to justice in public health, this conception of social justice can be explicated in terms of its position along each of two normative axes featuring, respectively, objects of distribution and distributive principles (Persad 2018; Dukhanin et al. 2018) . Page 178 of 321 Objects of Distrib ution: Multidimensional Metrics of Well -Being Whereas the object of distribution for traditional CEA is aggregate health benefit, typically assessed by sum mary measures like DALYs averted, alternative techniques enable users to consider other objects as well . JE-CEA is meant to help users apply to health -related economic evaluation the normative proposition that health is one among other core dimensions of well-being holding fundamental ethical importance as \"basic determinants of the character and qualit y of human life\" (Bailey et al. 2015) . This proposition is commo n to a family of theories of justice grounded in multidimensional metrics of well -being, whose defining members are capabilities theories and well -being theories. Each theory in its own way focuses the requirements of justice on societal obligations to en able people to exercise core capabilities or to function in core dimensions of well -being (Nussbaum 2011; Wolff et al. 2007; Powers & Faden 2006) . We don't aim here to add new substantive argumentation to the cu mulative case that proponents of these theories have already made for regarding other dimensions of well -being as comparable to health in fundamental ethical importance. Because of the importance of social justice as a moral consideration in public health, it is ethically preferable for the methodological repertoire of health -related economic evaluation to encompass the full range of leading conceptions of social justice, and so, with respect to objects of distribution, to include techniques for assessing the impacts of compared options on people's experiences of disadvantage in multiple dimensions of well -being (Dukhanin et al. 2018) . Expanding the methodological repertoire in this way still leaves it up to users and their stakeholders to determine whether, under what conditions, and for what reasons the use of such techniques is warranted. Distributive Principles: Prioritization Norm JE-CEA belo ngs to a family of techniques designed for use by people who seek to temper the maximizing distribut ive principle familiar to users of traditional CEA (Cookson et al. 2017; Johri & Norheim 2012; Norheim et al. 2014) . The purpose of the JE component is to enable users to apply a prioritization norm that is broadly consistent with prioritarian, egalitarian, and sufficientarian distributive principles, and which we articulate here as ' to protect and relieve people from severe societal disadvantage '. This norm is of comparable concern to Page 179 of 321 prioritarians aiming to uplift the worst off in society (Wolff et al. 2007) , egalitarians aiming to avoid and redress undue inequalities, and sufficientarians aiming to avoid and remediate each person's experience of shor tfalls from sufficient levels of, for instance, capabilit y (Nussbaum 2011) or funct ioning (Powers & Faden 2006) . Again, we don't aim here to m ake additional arguments in support of these non -maximizing distributive principles. Rather, our point is that so far as it's ethically preferable for the methodological repertoire of economic evaluation to be able to accommodate the full range of leading conceptions of social justice, it should include techniques for applying this prioritization norm to relevant forms of program impact. JE-CEA is meant to help users apply this prioritization norm in the first instance to certain dimensions of well -being besides health. The JE component is designed to assess the impacts of compared public health program options in multiple non-health dimensions of well - being, and to do so alongside the CEA component, which retains its traditional maximizing distributive pri nciple with respect to its traditional target o bject, aggregate health benefit . One might ask, why not also modify the CEA component internally? That is, if health is comparable to other dimensions of well -being in ethical importance, and is thus one among other sites of societal disadvantage potentially subject to the prioritization norm, why continue to assess program options' health impacts only in terms of traditional CEA? While we acknowledge that this question must be addressed in due course, we have chosen to bracket it at the present early stage in JE -CEA's development. Our s tarting point is the fact that traditional CEA is in wide use, and indeed has been used in preparing the EIC for Gambiense HAT, presenting a timely real-world occasion to explore the use of JE -CEA . Too, whereas there is already a robust scholarly literature on internal modifications to CEA, a recent systematic review finds relatively little work on how to complement economic evaluation with assessment of the comparably important m oral concern about the impacts of health interventions on people's experience in multiple non -health dimensions of well -being (Dukhanin et al. 2018) . What we explore here is a decidedl y incremental approach, attempting to make methodological progress one step at a time, holding CEA's traditional normative bearin gs constant and supplementing it with JE. Page 180 of 321 8.4 Structure of JE -CEA Even holding CEA internally constant, there might be many ways t o design an analytic technique that would fill the identified methodological gap. By demonstrating the use of JE -CEA as overlaid onto a completed CEA in a specific decision context, we hope also to advance the discussion of kindred techniques for which JE -CEA might serve initially as a foil. The longer -term goal is to strengthen methodological capacity in the field of health -related economic evaluation to represent the relevant conception of social justice. As we outline the structure of JE -CEA, then, we de scribe key methodological choices in the awareness that other designers might reasonably choose differently. Zwerling and colleagues construct the JE component of JE -CEA as a more formal expression of the method of ethical analysis that Bailey and colleag ues first developed to extend the EIC framework. The structure of that precursor method responds to a set of desiderata, derived from the EIC literature, on meeting the need for a method to assess psychological, psychosocial, and social impacts in the NTD EICs (Bailey et al. , 2015: 630 -631): \"Ideally, this method should strengthen EIC -supported deliberations by (1) delineating ethically important categories of benefits and burdens not otherwise captured in the EIC framework, (2) assessing aspects of distributive equity and fairness not otherwise captured, (3) recognizing widely varying life circumstances among people affected by the diseases and interventions, and (4) ethically interpreting the evidence base concerning disease -specific psychological, psychosocial, and social impacts.\" Desideratum (3) provides the rationale for Bailey and colleagues' choice to draw on theories of justice derived from multidimensional metrics of well -being (Powers & Faden attributing fundamental ethical value to each of the basic dimensions of well -being that affect the quality of human lives across widely varied conceptions of the good life, this approach...has fair claim to support a maximally broad consensus among people with different national, cultural, and personal backgrounds. Breadth of consensus is a matter of great importance in the EICs and for related global policy cho ices about eradicable infectious diseases considering the wide range of individuals and groups who stand to be involved or affected.\" Page 181 of 321 While some of these theories in themselves identify as many as ten or fourteen core dimensions, Bailey and colleagues focu s on four points of convergence or overlap identified in virtue of their robust endorsement across multiple theories: three core dimensions of well - being that ought to be protected and promoted by socially just health policies; and one core prioritization norm. The supposition behind the choice to focus on points of convergence or overlap across the theories is not the implausible expectation that each theory, taken in its entirety, would deliver the same result in the EIC decision context, but rather that the few elements on which the theories converge or overlap, in virtue of their plural theoretical grounding, have \"more robust stability and salience for ethical assessments\" than would the other, \"relatively more controversial elements...that lack plural g rounding in multiple theories\" (Bailey et al. 2015; Sen 2009) . These four elements form a core framework of social justice, embodying a distinct specification of the more generic conception of social justice ( protecting and relieving people from severe societal disadvantage in multiple dimensions of well -being ) discussed farther above. Specification of Normative Proposition ab out Objects of D istribution In response to EIC desideratum (1), agency , association , and respect are the core categories of benefits and burdens (besides life and health, which are otherwise captured in the EIC framework by traditional assessment technique s like CEA) that Bailey and colleagues identify as points of convergence or overlap among the contributing theories of justice. They characterize agency as \"the ability to lead one's own life and engage in activities one finds meaningful\"; association as \"the ability to engage in a full range of intimate, familial, friendly, community, economic, and civic relationships with other people\"; and respect as \"the recognition, by others and oneself, of one's equal moral value, worth, and dignity as a person\" (Bailey et al. , 2015: 631- 632; see 631 -632 for detailed derivations from contributing theories). We explicate here a corresponding specification of the more generic normative proposition - that health is one among other core dimensions of well -being holding fundamental ethical importance - entertained farther above about objects of distribution: namely, that, whatever non - health dimensions of well -being hold fundamental ethical importance, agency, association, and respect are the least controversial candid ates for representation among potential objects of distribution that users of health -related economic evaluation ought to have the methodological capacity to assess. Page 182 of 321 This specification does not deny that other dimensions of well -being might also be worthy candidates; rather, it selects agency, association, and respect as dimensions that it makes the most sense to start with in building the methodological capacity to assess non -health dimensions. Bailey and colleagues (2015: 631 -632) justify the selection of agency, association, and respect by appeal to distinctively robust inter -theoretical agreement on their 'core' status. This selection might be challenged by disputing the choices to include or exclude certain theories of justice in the set of contributing theories, and by reexamining the contributing theories to confirm or disconfirm the identified loci of convergence/overlap. Either or both forms of challenge could generate variant sets of 'least controversial candidate' dimensions of well- being, with cor responding variations in the structure of JE -CEA. Even so, the overall approach of identifying such focal points remains viable as a means of seeking the least controversial normative grounding for JE- CEA. For the sake of simplicity in the initial stages of JE -CEA's methodological development, Zwerling and colleagues follow Bailey and colleagues' selection by focusing the JE component of JE- CEA on agency, association, and respect. We do the same in our exploration of JE -CEA in the Gambiense HAT EIC decision context. Specification of Prioritization Norm In response to EIC desideratum (2), Bailey and colleagues (2015: 631, italics added) find that theories of justice using multidimensional metrics of well -being converge on the following core prioritization no rm, which picks out aspects of distributive equity and fairness not otherwise captured in the EIC framework: that \"it is a priority and duty of justice to avert and alleviate clusters of disadvantage in multiple dimensions of well -being .\" For purposes of t he present discussion, we read this as a specification of the more generic prioritization norm discussed farther above ( to protect and relieve people from severe societal disadvantage ). The key normative commitment defended in the contributing theories' explicit supporting arguments for the specified prioritization norm is to protect and relieve already -disadvantaged people from vicious cycles whereby personal setbacks caused by adverse impacts in some dimensions of well- being expose them to adverse impac ts in other dimensions, making them even worse off (Wolff et al. 2007; Powers & Faden 2006; Venkatapuram 2011) . This commitment has heigh tened salience for public health programs addressing health problems to which people are disproportionately exposed through pre -existing disadvantages such as severe poverty Page 183 of 321 and social marginalization (Faden & Shebaya 2016) . The intent of JE -CEA is to focus on just such decision contexts, NTDs being a prime example (Azoh Barry 2014) . In response to EIC desideratum , Bailey and colleagues (Bailey et al. 2015) propose to interpret the evidence base on disease -specific psychological, psychosocial, and social impacts by fir st examining the empirically known impacts on each of the three selected core dimensions of well -being, then asking \"how those impacts might create or exacerbate\" cross - dimensional clustering of disadvantage, and finally comparing the scenarios under analy sis in terms of the revealed patterns of impacts on disadvantage by the lights of the prioritization norm. They use this method chiefly to analyze the evidence a bout disease -attributable impacts of lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis (oncho), with the aim of informing the ethical rationale for investing global health resources in programs to control, eliminate, or eradicate LF and oncho. For each of these NTDs , neither of which is fatal in short order if untreated, the evidence indicates many disti nctly disadvantageous impacts of the disease itself upon agency, association, and respect, impacts that stand in need of distinct assessment by means over and above the traditional measures that can already assess impacts on life (survival) and health. By contrast, because of Gambiense HAT's catastrophic morbidity and rapid progression to fatality if untreated, the disease's adverse impacts on life and health as assessed by traditional measures are largely coextensive with its disadvantageous impacts on age ncy, association, and respect. For this reason, o ur background assumption is that effective interventions used in the Gambiense HAT disease control and elimination strategies will themselves avert and alleviate disease -attributable adverse impacts on pre -existing clustered disadvantage as experienced by individual members of the at -risk population. The distinct purpose of JE -CEA, as we are explor ing its use in the Gambiense HAT EIC decision context , is to compare the candidate disease control and elimination strategies with respect to how far they might worsen (or not) any pre -existing clustered disadvantage through adverse impacts attributable to people's undergoing the public health interventions that the strategies deploy. That is, relative to a population baseline of pre -existing clustered disadvantage, some interventions in themselves may have the effect of worsening that clustered disadvantage whereas others under comparison do not -- for examp le, diagnostic testing for Gambiense HAT by means of lumbar puncture conducted in public vs. a rapid diagnostic test that can be done in private. Page 184 of 321 The scope of application for the prioritization norm in JE -CEA is given by the prior scope of the policy ques tion addressed by the CEA component (Zwerling et al. 2017) . In the context of deciding on optimal strategies for control and elimination of Gambiense HAT , the scope of the relevant CEA component is restricted to populations whose members are, largely because of the pre -existing clustered disadvantage that they are likely to have in common , at risk of Gambiense HAT in endemic areas. With reference to the population inside the scope of the policy comparison, the id eal social justice outcome is for no one to experience worsened clustering of disadvantage through their experience of undergoing the interventions; short of the ideal, it is better for as few people as possible to experience worsened clustering of disadva ntage, and for those who do to experience as little of it as possible. For this reason, the principal attribute on which the JE component of JE -CEA is meant to help users to evaluate the options under comparison is the extent to which each option might worsen pre-existing clustered disadvantage by imposing adverse in tervention -attributable impacts. This emphasis is in keeping with the analytic orientation of traditional CEA, which is designed to compare options partly in terms of incremental differences in units of effectiveness (such as DALYs); similarly, JE -CEA is designed to present alongside CEA an additional comparison of the same options, in terms of incremental differences in their impacts on people's experiences of disadvantage. JE-CEA takes empirica l findings as input \"to track the occurrence, magnitude, and breadth of cross -cutting impacts on the three core dimensions of well- being \" where, \"[u]sing three impact levels, the social justice assessment for a given scenario under analysis could be eithe r 'expected not to worsen. . .', 'may worsen. . .', or 'expected to worsen.. .',\" the -existing clustering of disadvantage (Zwerling et al. 2017) . These assessments can then be examined alongside the results o f CEA, and any other applicable forms of evaluation of interest to decision makers, as performed for the same set of options. The contributing theories of justice that converge on JE -CEA's specified prioritization norm use the idea of clustered disadvantage for various purposes. One of these theories, that of Wolff and de -Shalit (2007) uses it to solve \"the indexing problem\" of i dentifying who is among the least advantaged in society at large: with the answer being \"groups of people who appear towards the bottom in several important categories of disadvantage, whose functionings in these categories are at a low level or very insec ure\". Within JE -CEA's scope of application in the types of decision contexts for which it is designed, we take the indexing Page 185 of 321 problem to have been pre -solved by the restriction of programmatic scope to a disease, like Gambiense HAT, to which people are typic ally exposed by conditions likely to impose multidimensional disadvantage ( e.g., being both impoverished to the point of curtailed agency and marginalized to the point of curtailed association). The guiding ethical concern for users of JE -CEA, given that t he compared program options' intended beneficiaries are likely already among the worst off in those terms, is to give some priority to not exacerbating the prior clustering of disadvantage in non -health dimensions of well -being as an unintended consequence of health -promoting interventions. An intervention- attributable adverse impact in any one of JE- CEA's core dimensions - agency, association, or respect - might exacerbate prior clustering of disadvantage even by compounding a person's prior disadvantage o nly in that one dimension, so far as they were already disadvantaged in one or two of the other core dimensions too, making the post -intervention cross -dimensional pattern even more disadvantageous than the pre -intervention pattern. Intervention -attributab le impacts that cross two or three core dimensions add further clustering in themselves. Nonetheless, variants on JE- CEA, or kindred techniques, might specify differently the generic prioritization norm, for instance by somehow weighting impacts on the sel ected core non -health dimensions, without using the idea of clustering either to describe the prior baseline of disadvantage or to make the social justice assessment in evaluating the compared program options. Again, for the sake of simplicity in the initi al stages of JE -CEA's methodological development, Zwerling and colleagues retain Bailey and colleagues' specified version of the generic prioritization norm, and we do the same here. Whereas Zwerling and colleagues illustrate the use of JE -CEA in conjuncti on with a decision tree technique for CEA comparisons (Zwerling et al. 2017) , our adaptation will instead illustrate it in conjunction with a dynamical transmission modelling approach for CEA comparisons, as is more appropriate for the Gambiense HAT decision context (Steinmann et al. 2015; Sutherland et al. 2017) . In addition, whereas Zwerling and colleagues confine their discussion of justice enhancement to its conjunction with the main CEA analysis in their example of novel vs. standard multi -drug resistant tuberculosis regimens, we consider in the Gambiense HAT decision cont ext the conjunction of justice enhancement not only with CEA but also with a probability of elimination analysis. Page 186 of 321 8.5 Justice -enhance cost -effectiveness analysis for Gambiense HAT control and elimination strategies Overview of Methods In our proposed adapt ation for the Gambiense HAT disease control a nd elimination decision context , JE-CEA proceeds in 3 phases (Box 1). Phase 0 is to identify the options to be evaluated. Phase 1 is to construct social justice assessments, drawing on the best available evidenc e, corresponding to people's experiences of disadvantage under each option. Phase 2 is to represent these assessments along with the CEA to demonstrate JE -CEA. We will also extend the justice enhancement technique of social justice assessment to the probab ility of elimination predictions for Gambiense HAT. Box 1. Overview of me thods for Justice -Enhanced Cost -effectiveness Analysis (JE -CEA) as applied to Gambiense HAT test case Phase 0: Identify options of interest CEA compare s health interventions in terms of their incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER is defined as the incremental cost of implementing a given intervention relative to the next best intervention (the difference in cost between the two ) divided by the incremental effectiveness of implementing it relative to the next best intervention (the difference in effectiveness between the two ). Traditionally, effectiveness has been measured in Page 187 of 321 terms of health, using health measures such as DALYs averted. The ICER can be expressed as the incremental cost per DALY averted. An intervention is 'dominated' when another intervention costs less and has better outcomes relative to it. Our application of JE -CEA builds on a prior CEA study that modelled cos t- effectiveness and probabil ity of reaching elimination of Gambiense HAT for several strategies featuring different combinations of standard approaches and emerging technologies for HAT diagnosis and treatment over 30 years (2013- 2042), using a dynamical transmission model (Sutherland et al. 2017) . These strategies are composed of varying scenarios previously described, where each scenario is characterized by its availability between 2013 and 2042, its approaches to case identification , diagnosis , and treatment, and whether vector control is included as an additional method to prevent transmission (Steinma nn et al. 2015) . A major aim of the prior modelling study was to assess the value of investing in novel Gambiense HAT technologies vis -\u00e0-vis the goal of reaching elimination. The objects of analysis in the prior CEA study by Sutherland and colleagues (2017), and correspondingly in our illustration of JE -CEA, are the strategies considered as each would be implemented over the full 30- year time horizon. It is important to distinguish between the cost of investing in a strategy over that full 30 -year time horizon and the annual cost per case found, which may fluctuate from year to year, and which for elimination strategies will increase over time as disease prevalence declines. Whereas the CEA highlights the value for money of investing in each strategy relative to its comparators over the 30 -year time horizon, the annual cost per case relates instead to the annual budget for carrying out the selected program (which would be assessed differently in the decision -making dossier) . For purposes of illustrating JE -CEA, we focus on the 5 strategies most important to consider for areas where transmission risk is low ( Figure 20) (Sutherland et al. 2017) . The first strategy continues the current paradigm. The other 4 strategies, which deploy varying combinations of novel technologies, were shown to dominate all other alternatives to the current paradigm on grounds of either probability of elimination or cost-effectiveness, or both (Sutherland et al. 2017) . The Control strategy (Strategy A in Sutherland et al ., (2017 )) depicts the current Gambiense HAT treatment paradigm. The term Control in this analysis refers to a form of disease control program in the sense of a public health intervention strategy intended to 'control' the disease, that is, to reduce its \"incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality to a locally Page 188 of 321 acceptable level as a result of deliberate efforts\" with the understanding that \"continued intervention measures are required to maintain the reduction\" (Dowdle 1998) . (This is by contrast with 'control' in the experimental se nse of a neutral, non -intervention, no -impact baseline, and by contrast too with 'control' in what is perhaps a colloquial sense of merely observing the status quo while taking no deliberate action to influence future disease parameters.) Thus, the Gambien se HAT Control strategy, like all the other strategies under comparison in our analysis, is an active public health intervention that must be assessed for its potential adverse impacts on pre -existing clustered disadvantage. During Control , in low- transmission settings, WHO advises that patients seek out treatment (passive surveillance) (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013a) . Suspected cases undergo blood serum tests ( card agglutinatio n test for trypanosomiasis, or CATT) to find antigens in response to parasite presence. To determine the stage of the disease, l umbar puncture at a health facility is required to draw cerebrospinal fluid for parasitological confirmation. Confirmed cases ar e referred to specialized treatment centres. People in stage 1 of the disease require 12 -day intravenous treatment in hospital with pentamidine . People in stage 2 require 14 days of nifurtomix - eflornithine ( chemotherapy ) in hospital. Control with tiny t argets (Strategy B in Sutherland et al., 2017), a potential strategy for elimination, combines the current treatment paradigm ( Control ) with novel vector control interventions called 'tiny targets': small flag -like traps colored to attract tsetse flies and covered with insecticide to kill them (Steinmann et al. 2015) . Accelerated technologies (Strategy D in Sutherland et al., 2017 ) maintains Control until 2016, when new diagnostics become available. Local health centers could then use a rapid diagnostic test (HAT Sero K) instead of CATT, and use loop -mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP ) for parasitological confirmation. L umbar puncture would still be required at a health facility for staging. S tage 1 treatment remains the same but patients in stage 2 can take a 10- day oral regimen of fexinidazole. Then in 2019, a novel one -day oral tablet, oxaborole SCYX- 7158, is expected to become available to treat both stages of the disease, rendering differe ntial diagnosis unnecessary, so that a rapid diagnostic test alone would suffice with no lumber puncture for staging. The all -oral treatment for both stages could also mean that patients no longer need to leave their village for treatment. Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance is the sa me as Accelerated technologies except that screening is conducted every two years ('Strategy D+ in Sutherland et al., 2017 ). Page 189 of 321 Because surveillance teams conduct open screening campaigns in villages, the diagnostic procedures, including lumbar puncture for staging, would all be done publicly, until the oral Oxaborole treatment arrives for both stages in 2019. Accelerated technologies with tiny targe ts (Strategy E in Sutherland et al., 2017) is the same as Accelerated technologies except that it simultaneously deploys vector control with tiny targets. Figure 20 . Strategies for control and elimination in low risk transmission areas* Phase 1: Construct social justice assessments Phase 1 is to construct social justice assessments corresponding to people's experiences of disadvantage for each option under evaluation (Bailey et al. , 2015: 632; cf. Zwerling et al., 2017: S71-S72). Step 1 is to assess people's experience in core dimensions of well -being under each option. Step 2 is to assess the impact of each option on the clustering of disadvantage across core dimensions of well -being. Step 1. Assessment of people's exper ience in core dimensions of well -being Because all untreated cases of HAT are debilitating and fatal, any safe and effective preventive or therapeutic intervention that people willingly accept is clearly better than none in terms of agency, respect, and association . Bu t the standard and novel interventions deployed under different Gambiense HAT control and elimination strategies may themselves vary in the nature, intensity, and distribution of their impacts on core dimensions of well - being. The point of c onstructing social justice assessments is to estimate th e 'price' in mal - Page 190 of 321 distributed disadvantage imposed by the current paradigm ( i.e., Control as an ongoing public health intervention strategy) as compared with alternative strategies. Step 1 is to ask whether and, if so, how, people experience adverse impacts on agency, respect, or association because of their exposure to the specific health interventions deployed under each strategy. To find out, primary qualitative data collection would be ideal (Zwer ling et al., 2017: S72). Future qualitative studies are required for the development and refinement of JE -CEA methodology for use in any specific decision context, including the Gambiense HAT context. For purposes of the present analysis, however, we drew on a systematic r eview of empirical literature about people's experiences of standard HAT diagnosis and treatment interventio ns (Muela and Hausmann -Muela, 2013).(Muela & Hausmann -Muela 2013) Table 1 relates the most striking findi ngs from this literature to the strategies under analysis. Our application of JE -CEA in this paper deals only with low -transmission areas, where case identification is limited to passive surveillance undertaken in more private clinic settings under 4 of the 5 strategies considered: Control , Control with tiny targets, Accelerated technologies, and Accelerated technologies and tiny targets; thus, for each of those 4 strategies, the literature indicates that social justice impacts would occur mainly through treatment experiences. Under 1 of the 5 strategies considered, namely Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance, the literature indicates that standard approaches to active surveillance for HAT, because they occur in public, bring embarrassment and shame (especially for those who need lumbar puncture to determine their stage of a stigmatized disease), and thereby infringe significantly on respect (Mpanya et al., 2012) . In the Discussion section, we will return to this point and consider the need for more private and dignified approaches to active screening. Regarding treatment technologies, t he most marked impacts on disadvantage under both strategies deploying standard treatment ( Control and Control with tiny targets) are experienced by patients at disease Stage 2, and they arise from the 6+ months' post- treatment prohibitions on patients' activities. For example, q ualitative studies conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo report that communities commonly uphold prohibitions on heavy labor and sexual intercourse during the 6+ month post -treatment period (Robays et al. 2007; Mpanya et al. 2012; Mpanya e t al. 2015) . The prohibition on heavy labor amounts to \"forced inactivity\" (Robays et al. 2007) that severely restricts the patient's agency. The prohibition on sexual intercourse sti rs up \"marital problems and conflicts\" ,(Robays et al. 2007) Page 191 of 321 a critical setback in association. Moreover, \"a strong element of social control\" and victim - blaming in the event of \"[t]reatment failure and other complications\" arise from the widely held perception that patients' adherence to post- treatment prohibitions - which also preclude smoking, drinking alcohol, eating hot food, and walking in the sun - is key to recovery (Mpanya et al. , 2012: 7). As one focus group participant said, \"A person must be near at all times to keep an eye on him, to make sure he avoids all these things\" (Mpanya et al., 2012: 7, Table 3). Such intense social monitoring and po tential victim -blaming are setbacks in the domain of respect . JE-CEA is precisely intended to represent these sorts of adverse impacts on agency, association, and respect, over and above the costs already measurable by existing evaluation techniques. We hypothesize that the substi tution of novel diagnostic a nd treatment technologies would remove the specific adverse impacts of standard ap proaches without introducing comparable new ones. By contrast, the addition of 'tiny targets' as a vector control intervention would not in itself change the quality of people's diagnostic and treatment experiences, but would rather serve to reduce HAT incidence over time so that fewer people are exposed to HAT diagnosis and treatment. Wherever novel diagnostic and treatment technologies are implem ented in the future, their successful implementation will require ongoing community consultation, and empirical research would be needed to test our substitution hypothesis . As noted by Mpanya and colleagues, the intensive post- treatment prohibitions that presently take the form of taboos originated in communities' uptake of past communications with healthcare providers trying to manage HAT treatment with a relatively toxic drug (melarsoprol) (Mpanya et al. 2015; Kovacic et al. 2016) . Even where the use of less toxic drugs makes such pro hibitions no longer medically necessary, they might still be believed necessary by the community. Under those circumstances, on one hand, the possibility arises for public health interventions to facilitate the evolution of community norms through respectf ul dialogue and education in collaboration with community opinion leaders; on the other hand, if community norms do not evolve for whatever reason, the social justice impacts resulting from enforcement of the prior norms might carry over to new treatment m odalities. Page 192 of 321 Step 2. Assess ment of impact on clustering of disadvantage across core dimensions of well - being The next step is to assess the impact of each strategy on the clustering of disadvantage . At least 3 assessment levels are possible. For ease of visualization when considering social justice impacts alongside results from other forms of evaluation, Zwerling and colleagues proposed a color -coding scheme representing 3 levels of expected impact (Zwerling et al. 2017) . We propose a similar color -coding scheme (adjusted for readers with color -blindness) as follows: - Orange: \"Expected to worsen the clustering disadvantage\", Yellow: \" May worsen the clus tering of disadvantage\" and - Turquoise: \"Expected not to worsen the clustering of disadvantage.\" While finer, intermediate gradations are possible in principle, their definition requires further development of JE -CEA methodology. Meanwhile, JE -CEA can sti ll reveal striking contrasts among the social justice impacts of different strategies under analysis (Figure 2)14. Because standard treatment for Stage 2 of HAT tends to impose post -treatment burdens in all 3 core dimensions of well -being (Figure 21), the Control and Control with tiny target strategies warrant an assessment of \"Expected to worsen the clustering of disadvantage\", relative to the pre -exist ing clustered disadvantage shared by the population at risk of Gambiense HAT. By contrast, the Accelerated technologies and Accelerated technologies with tiny target strategies , under their component scenarios that roll out post- 2016, promise to avoid imposing comparable post -treatment burdens (Sutherland et al. 2017) , and so they warrant an assessment of \"Expected not to worsen the clustering of disadvantage\". Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance continues to impinge on respect through the screening campaigns that will require public lumbar puncture for staging until a treatment for both stages arrives in 2019. Because social justice impacts are attributable to this strategy in only 1 core dimension of well -being, it is assigned a n assessment of 'May worsen the clustering of disadvantage\" 14 Our analysis departs here from the originally proposed JE -CEA approach (Zwerling et al. , 2017) in that we don't use length of colored bars to highlight the number of peo ple impacted, because our extension of the Phase 2 social justice assessment to the probability of elimination analysis will indirectly highlight the number of people potentially impacted over time. Page 193 of 321 (depending on the extent to which this impact might compound pre -exist ing disadvantages in the experiences of people affected). Figure 21. Summary of 'clustering of disadvantage' across well -being by colour Phase 2: Consider social justice impact s with CEA Figure 22A shows the results of the prior CEA study for the 5 strategies we considered here. The Control strategy would cost $ 3 ($2.52) and incur 0.04 DALYs per person at risk in a low - transmission are a and is dominated by A ccelerated technologies, which costs approximately the same ($2.97) but incurs 0.01 DALYs less than the control (ICER = $160/DALY averted). Scaling up surveillance in low transmission areas to once every two years ( Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance ) would cost a total $20 per person at risk, but would incur only 0.004 DALYs resulting in an ICER of $654 per DALY averted. Control with tiny targets and Accelerated technologies and tiny targets are both dominated. Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance and Accelerated technologies would be considered cost -effective. However, some influential global health funders consider $300 per DALY averted as a threshold of cost -effectiveness for investments in low income countries (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) International 2014) . With that constraint, Accelerated technologies would be the only option. Page 194 of 321 When we overlay our social justice assessments onto the prior CEA results ( Figure 22B), the social justice assessments and CEA results are concordant. Accelerated technologies is cost-effective, and in the long run is not expected to worsen clustering of disadvantage. Figure 22. Economic evaluation in low risk transmission areas of Gambiense HAT A. B. An applied extension of Phase 2: Social justice impacts alone considered alongside probability of disease elimination (separate from CEA) In a previous analysis of elimination targets, the probability of elimination (Figure 23A) appeared to be highest under Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance , Accelerated technologies with tiny targe ts, and Control with tiny targets (Sutherland et al. 2017) . Therefore, in Page 195 of 321 the absence of social justice assessment, we would conclude that these 3 options would be the best for elimination in a low -transmission area. But when we overlay our social justice assessments onto these same outcomes (Figure 23B), Control with tiny targets, in addition to performing worse than the other 2 strategies with respect to probability of elimination, has the major drawback of being expected throughout its course to worsen the clustering of disadvantage for people exposed to stage 2 treatment. As for Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance, although it has the highest probability of leading to elimination at the quickest rate, it also has an interim time when it may worsen the clustering of disadvantage for people exposed to active surveillance . Thus , Accelerated technologies and Accelerated technologies with tiny targets, under which the Gambiense HAT interventions that people would experience are not expected to worsen cluste ring of disadvantage for them, are prefer able in terms of social justice impacts attributable to interventions. Page 196 of 321 Figure 23. Probability of elimination in low risk transmission areas of Gambiense HAT A. B. Page 197 of 321 8.6 Discussion Although Accelerated technologies is cost -effective and not expected to worsen the clustering of disadvantage, it is unlikely to lead to elimination. The low probability of elimination under Accelerated technologies thus presents a trade -off within social justice so far as ongoing residual disease incidence would impose future social justice impacts attributable to the disease (Bailey et al. 2015) - impacts that could be averted with eventual elimination under Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance, but at the risk of exposing people to other social justice impacts attributable to active screening, at least until 2019 when the oral Oxaborole treatment suitable for both disease stages would remove the need for public lumbar puncture to determine disease stage. Under Accelerated technologies, with the permanent prospect of residual disease incidence, all three core dimensions of well -being could remain precarious for anyone at risk of Gambiense HAT (because all untreated cases are debilitating and fatal), except so far as they could count on timely diagnosis and treatment. From this standpoint, however, the saving grace of Accelerated technologies is the roll -out of increasingly simplified diagnosis and treatment that would be expected to avert disease -attributable soci al justice impacts while refraining from imposing intervention -attributable social justice impacts. This prospect suggests that Accelerated technologies might be favored on social justice grounds over Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance, ev en taking into account the residual disease incidence under Accelerated technologies. The social justice assessments and CEA results (setting aside for a moment the probability of elimination analysis) converge on recommending Accelerated technologies, given the prevailing cost -effectiveness threshold among global heath funders. If that threshold were to increase, however, to the point of admitting Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance, it could present a trade -off between cost-effectiveness o f Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance and the superior protections against treatment -attributable social justice impacts afforded under Accelerated technologies. This may truly be an option, as low middle -income countries may consider cost - effectiveness thresholds near $1000 per DALY based on their GDP (Santatiwongchai et al. 2015) . Indeed, the global health commitment to Gambiense HAT elimination may require a cost-effectiveness threshold of around $700 per DALY averted, to accommodate increased activ e surveillance in low transmission areas (Sutherland et al. 2017) . Another reason why Page 198 of 321 increased active surveillance m ay be necessary to reach elimination is that the current prevalence of HAT is truly unknown. Less than 10% of the at- risk population has been screened. Putting all these considerations together, the value that JE -CEA ultimately adds to deliberation in th e Gambiense HAT decision context is to underscore the ethical importance of flagging adverse social justice impacts of otherwise attractive options, so that opportunities to mitigate those impacts can then be explored. In this case, JE -CEA renders highly s alient the need to devise approaches to active screening that protect people's privacy, confidentiality, and dignity better than the current standard procedure. Of course, the ethical importance of such protections is a reason, independent of the public he alth decision context surrounding Gambiense HAT elimination, to develop a more respectful active screening approach. So far as the global health commitment to NTD elimination is motivated by considerations of social justice, consistency and coherence requi re stakeholders to pursue pathways toward the goal that best avert or alleviate adverse social justice impacts for members of at- risk communities along the way. If the most attractive option in terms of probability of elimination and cost- effectiveness tur ns out to be Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance, JE-CEA reveals that it's ethically preferable to avoid active screening procedures that require public diagnostic procedures. A more progressive solution to the trade -off identified above, b etween bringing future disease incidence to zero and protecting people actively screened along the way, could be to develop a modified strategy incorporating more private and dignified active screening, Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance*. On the other hand, the time it would take to develop, pilot, and scale up this improved screening procedure might run through 2019, at which point the projected availability of oral Oxaborole treatment would permit active screening to be done without the need for public diagnostic procedures. This raises the possibility of a differently modified strategy, Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance** that would involve delaying the start of biannual surveillance pending the availability of oral Oxaborole. Both modified strategies would need to be re -assessed under the other forms of evaluation (probability of disease elimination and CEA). Page 199 of 321 8.7 Limitations and directions for future work There are still many refinements to be considered as JE -CEA develo ps. Primarily, JE -CEA is not meant to be a decision algorithm. It does not itself resolve ethical tensions or trade -offs but rather articulates them explicitly: Is it better to delay elimination until more equitable tools are available? Or should we pursu e elimination and try to improve the mitigation of social justice impacts along the way? Can we increase our cost -effectiveness threshold for this decision? While we have indicated in the Discussion section the beginning of a possible deliberative pathway informed by JE- CEA, i t is truly up to the stakeholders involved to work through these ethical trade -offs. The main normative contribution of JE -CEA is to identify and make salient the social justice impacts of options under analysis. The experiential natur e of the impacts highlighted by JE -CEA suggests that the involvement of patient and community representatives and local NTD activists is of utmost importance. For instance, NTD activists belonging to at -risk communities could decide to lead a de -stigmatization campaign alleviating the current social justice impacts of Accelerated technologies with biannual surveillance , so that it could be implemented as is. To facilitate the emergence of community -led solutions, JE-CEA could help to organize systematic sta keholder deliberation using multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) frameworks (Thokala & Duenas 2012) or Delphi panel approaches (Assasi et al. 2014) . Concerns remain regarding our hypothesis that the substitution of novel Gambiense HAT diagnostic and treatment technologies would remove the specific adverse impacts of standard ap proaches without introducing comparable new ones. Local perceptions of novel technologies are currently unknown and will need to be assessed by medical anthropologists and other social scientists. Outdated post -treatment taboos might evolve in synch with the appearance of safer treatments on the market (Mpanya et al. 2015) . There is evidence that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for a disease with a symptomatic profile like that of Gambiense HAT (Bisser et al. 2016) are considered acceptable if the communitie s feel confident in the healthcare workers providing the services (Mukanga et al. 2010; Mushi et al. 2016) , the supply of RDTs is maintained (Diggle et al. 2014) and the cost to the community is minimal (Cohen et al. 2015) . The initial version of the JE-CEA framework proposed by Zwerling and colleague s (2017) focuses on capturing the \"worsening of disadvantage\" for interventions under assessment. The thought here is that it' s of paramount moral importance to expose and avoid Page 200 of 321 unintended consequences whereby health interventions might worsen further the position of people \" who were already relatively badly off before enactment of the policy, and who may have come into the line of fire of adverse policy impacts through the very pre -existing circumstances by which they were already disadvantaged \" (Zwerling et al. 2017) . There is also a potential , however, to consider the positive impacts of new technologies so far as they might protect and relieve intended beneficiaries from severe societal disadvantage by promoti ng \"'fertile functionings' ( i.e. those functionings the securing of which is likely to secure further functionings )\" (Wolff et al. 2007) . For instance, there is emerging evidence that including women in vector cont rol campaigns (tiny targets) and elimination programs for Gambiense HAT may lead to female empowerment and increase community engagement (Kovacic et al. 2013; Kovacic 2015) . Further research toward the more complete development of JE -CEA and kindred techniques should explicitly account for how positive and negative components interact when assessing the clustering of disadvantage in Phase 1 of the social justice assessment. There is also the need to evaluate these results in the context of uncertainty. For instance, even in well -funded scree ning campaigns, systematic bias and soci al exclusion preference may occur , as local campaigns may prioritize urban areas that are more feasible to reach, leading to un intentional geographical isolation of rural communities in hard -to-reach areas. To take into consideration such situations or oth er scenarios that deviate from the assumptions in the main analysis, the JE -CEA assessment could be conducted for e ach area separately so that decision makers can infer how distributions of social justice impacts vary by region. This form of sensitivity or scenario analysis is common practic e in CEA modelling, and hence the uncertainty analyses for JE -CEA are highly recommended in further applications. The approach to conjoining justice -enhancement with traditional techniques of economic evaluation may also require refinement. In this study we used the DALY as the main outcome, but other health -related quality -of-life (HRQoL) values use indices that ask patients about their ability to conduct everyday activities. Hence impacts on agency may already partly be captured by such measures. Further applications of JE-CEA may need to ensure that 'double -counting' for components of well -being is ruled out. Page 201 of 321 8.8 Conclusion Zwerling and colleagues (2017) have presented JE -CEA as a novel methodology based on the method of ethical analysis that Bailey and colleagues (2015) h ad earlier proposed as suitable to inform public health decision making in EIC decision contexts for NTDs. In this paper, we have tested the use of JE -CEA in the context of the Gambiense HAT EIC, demonstr ating how JE -CEA can help global health decision makers and stakeholders to evaluate not only the economic consequences but also the social justice impacts of different pathways towards disease control and elimination. In the Gambiense HAT decision context, the structure of JE -CEA as an 'alongside' method allows its justice enhancement (JE) component to be applied not only to CEA but also to probability elimination analysis. In principle, given its structural flexibility, JE -CEA is transferable to si milar decision contexts for other kinds of public health programs, where decision makers commonly evaluate clinical effectiveness, safety, value for money (i.e. cost-effectiveness), budget impact, and ethical considerations. JE -CEA could help to articulate as part of the overall evaluation the sorts of ethical considerations that might otherwise end up in a dossier paragraph summarizing available literature on social disparities. Motivated by social justice as a moral imperative to avoid and remediate inequ itable distributions of societal disadvantage , and resting on a normative basis derived from the family of capabilities and well- being theories of justice, JE -CEA can be further developed to assess explicitly the expected social justice impacts of the opti ons compared. In addition to broaden ing the evidence base available to stakeholders and decision makers, JE -CEA also offers a promising approach to including the voices and experiences of people whom public health programs are intended to benefit. 8.9 Key word s economic evaluation; elimination investment cases; neglected tropical diseases; social justice; Trypanosoma brucei gambiense Page 202 of 321 8.10 Funding This work was supported by an award from the Greenwall Foundation Making a Difference Program to M.W.M., in part by a National Institutes of Health award [grant number 1R01AI114458 -01A1 to M.W.M.], and in part by a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation award [grant number OPP1037660 to F.T.]. 8.11 Acknowledgments We are grateful to the journal reviewers and to Michael DiStefano, Davi d Dowdy, Vadim Dukhanin, Alexandra Searle, Holly Taylor, and Alice Zwerling for valuable comments.

Page 203 of 321 9. Discussion An EIC has been shown to be a labour intensive analysis, but bears the fruit of useful and applicable results for decision makers considering investments in NTD elimination. Although thus far various components of the EIC have been discussed as individual elements in chapters, they are now summarized in Table 18. At a national program level, it was consistently throughout all the analyses that the current control program is inferior to other elimination alternatives. S urveillance programs operating at 80% coverage in moderate and risk transmissions areas may reduce the cases, but reaching elimination in low risk transmission areas by relying on patients to self -report and bear the burden of out-of-pocket (OOP ) expenditures to seek treatment will not lead to full elimination across sub -Saharan Africa. This in turn renders that current approach to HAT control programs to be dominated in all cost -effectiveness analyses and incur the highest societal burden over time , and impinge of patient's core dimensi ons of well -being . An e limin ation program that focused on adopting new technologies for surveillance delivery, diagnostics and treatment ( Elimination I ) will save costs in the long run while reducing more cases than the current control program, and can be fully integr ated into the system eventually. It will also reduce CHE related to OOP and improve social justice across all domains of respect, association, and agency , however, it may not lead to complete elimination in low foci areas . Scaling -up surveilla nce in low risk foci all the while adopting new innovations and deploying tiny targets in high foci (Elimination II and III) seemed to be the optimal approach. Although they require a higher cost -effectiveness threshold than $300 per DALY averted used by t he BMGF (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) International 2014) they both lead to elimination and ha ve the possibility to be fully integrated into the health system. The main concern with these programs is that the interim intensive surveillance campaigns low transmission areas may worsen disadvantage, and this will need to be addressed. In addition, Elimination III deploys tiny targets in moderate risk foci which in turn increases the over all costs and cost- effectiveness, but ensures the probability of elimination this area. These results hence provide a series of information for stakeholders to decide which option is the most attractive for their concerns. For instance, global non -governmental (NGOs) Page 204 of 321 organizations may be most concerned with global elimination and prefer elimi nation programs (II and III) that excel in reaching elimination goals. On the other hand, national decision makers and investors may be more concerned with cost -effectiveness and may choose a more affordable program (Elimination I ) forgoing elimination goa ls within this generation, but ensuring case declines in high and moderate risk foci. There are also other combinations of programs for elimination that could be further explored. Page 205 of 321 Table 18.

At the initiation of the project the design of the EICs for lymphatic filariasis ( LF) and onchochercia sis (oncho) were more similar and hence it was thought that human African trypanosomiasis Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (hereunto referred to as ' HAT ') could not be compared; but in the end , there are core components of the EIC that resonate throughout the three dossiers. C omponents related to economic and elimination outcomes for the three are summarized in Table 19. Across the three diseases, the results demonstrate unanimously that the current strategies are insufficient to reach global goals of eradication or elimination. The overall incremental cost-effectiveness rations (ICERS) for elimination and or eradication demonstrate that HAT has higher cost -effectiveness ra tios than the other two . This is due to the fact that extensive financial resources ( i.e. surveillance, vector control prevention) are necessary investments to detect and treat HAT cases. In regards to societal costs, LF and oncho both calculated economic loss as volunteer s are used to administer mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns for disease eradication. Since there is no safe and preventative oral treatment available as yet for HAT, MDA campaigns are not feasible and hence the burden of direct costs related to seeking treatment rely on households of HAT patients. For this reason OOP expenditures were a more appropriate societal related cost for HAT. Overall, the results show that disease specific costs and benefits of eradication and elimination, and also demonstrate that EIC can be compared across diseases for possible discussions of investment prioritisation. Recent feedback from the BMGF also ( personal communication , BMGF ) reinforced that the dossiers were helpful in NTD funding prioritisation. Page 207 of 321 Table 19.

The model was used to forecast several strategies for treatment in a low transmission area in the absence of vector control to evaluate the potential impac t that a new TPP would have if fexinidazole arrived in 2016 to treat both disease Page 208 of 321 stages with or without oxaborole arriving on the market a couple years later .(M Kawonga et al. 2015; Mary Kawonga et al. 2015) The results presented in Figure 24 demonstrated that the approval of a new TPP in 2022 that could improve coverage due to its ease of use ( 'fexinidazole, oxaborole and TPP approved' ) would furth er reduce transmission, even in the absence of active surveillance. Furthermore, if oxaborole failed to reach market in 2019, but a new TPP was available in 2022, reduction of cases could still be attained ('fexinidazole and oxaborole approved '). These ou tcomes were presented to the Wellcome Trust and resulted in an 8 million GBF grant for the development of a new TPP awarded to NITD in collaboration with several academic laboratories. (Hoaglin et al. 2011; Jansen et al. 2011) According to the VOI analysi s, this also seems a reasonabl e investment given the uncertainty of elimination over the next 30 years for an at risk population of nearly 60 million people. Figure 24. Control and elimination strategies of new oral treatments 9.2 Lessons learned from the EIC As mentioned within the introduction of this thesis, at the onset of the project no formal methodology or protocol had been described for the EIC besides the itemized questions proposed by the Ernst Str\u00fcngmann and hence already established approaches were completed along with a few innovative approaches. In the end, the core analytical methodologies were completed and this process is outlined in Figure 25. Page 209 of 321 The evidence base collected relied largely on the available literature and hence several reviews were undertaken. Accessing national reports, case data available from the WHO repository and also speaking to experts in the field were key to understanding this neglected disease as often information goes unpublished due to lack of funding or interest from journals. Gathering a broad evidence base also highlighted the use of vector control use m ainly for prevention in animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT), which in turn resulted in a more holistic approach to elimination thinking for HAT. This also highlighted that aggregate secondary evidence is quite informative in decision making and also time efficient, and makes use of work done by previous researchers. The irony is that, resource rich countries are beginning to spend less on primary research and use secondary evidence for investments in health care decision making (HTA) whil e health research in resource poor countries rely more on evidence from high cost epidemiological studies to l obby for funding. Unfortunately this is not a sustainable approach. There is a lso a tendency to 'over -innovate' and seek out funding for new research before clear ly evaluating the existing evidence and seeing if we can use already well -established methodologies or liase with a group that may be more advanced than we are . This can be a humbling exercise for academics, but is essential for those working in situations with limited resources as was the case for HAT. Conceptualising current and alternative strategies was also a key process needed at the beginning of the EIC that in the end drove all the subsequent analyses. In the case of HAT, this was also a progressiv e process as potential scenarios involved into foci related strategies which in turn became potential control and elimination programs. Although further scenarios, strategies and programs could be hypothesized, this processed generated a series of relative options for the various investment profiles of the decision makers that will use this information. However, further work on HAT scenarios could involve strategies with more variation of the diagnostics tests as these parameters are not thought to be a bit more variant that once perceived (M Kawonga et al. 2015; Mary Kawonga et al. 2015) and also to explore the possibility of targeted campaigns to high risk sub - populations that may be contributing to the overall community disease transmission. Page 210 of 321 Figure 25. EIC project processes Modelling proved to be one of the key components of the project as it forecasted elimination probability for strategies, percentage reduction used to estimate the number of cases, health impacts calculated in the modelling using DALYs and cost projections . Subsequently as models are data driven, such analyses required a large number of input parameters. The model also contains stochastic inputs that led to the calculation of uncertainty in economic evaluation. One issue that came to light during the economic evaluation was when the time for choosing optimal strategies came. To evaluate the optimal strategy related to the foci specific areas, a cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF) was generated. The re sults shown in ( Figure 26) confirm that Strategy D or E are the most CE strategies in high and moderate areas based on different CE thresholds; however, in low transmission areas, strategy B no longer serves as an opt ion as it was dominated in the base case analysis. From recommended techniques (Sutherland 2016) strategy B should not be included as it was dominated in the base case analysis, but even when other strategies are removed, it does not compete as an artefact but as a cost- effective option with some probability for low r isk foci. This is something that decision makers need to consider under uncertainty and hence was why it was still considered a possible option in HAT elimination p rogram development . Page 211 of 321 Figure 26. CEAC versus CEAF in low transmissi on foci A. CEAC B.CEAF Through the process of the EIC, it also became evident that it is a work that re of analyses and expertise required and experts from various fields (i.e. Modeller, economist, information specialist (literature reviewer), ethical philosopher, epidemiologist, principal investigator (project manager) ) committed over an extended amount of time. This in turn means that future EICs, will not come at a small price; however , it has already been shown that these investments are worthwhile. 9.3 Further and continued research within the EIC Governance and funding In Chapter 7, health systems thinking was used to amalgamate key actors in the Gambiense HAT elimination, and also highlighted that integration would influence most actors at the Nation al level with few changes in governance, finance and information. However, there is still a need to evaluate the current power structure of governance for HAT to ensure that integration goes smoothly and also to ensure that the key players collaborate tow ards global elimination. Network analyses using social network analysis (Barrett 2013) or Bayesian network analysis commonly used i n indirect -treatment comparison (Policy Cures 2008) , could be a potential avenue to further evaluate the implications that relationships in governance have in relation to what is achieved on the ground in the affected nations. Without any formal analysis, the known connections of the actors in the health building blocks ( Chapter 7 ) already Page 212 of 321 reveal ( refer to Figure 27) that the BMGF are a high frequency donor with several connections to financial ties to MSF , R&D , and WHO. MSF and the NSSCP have the greatest links to the patients, families and communities. There are quite a few peripheral institutions whose complete roles would require future research . This could be done to discern each players ' involvement as the role of new individuals as integration occurs. Network analysis can also be done to show the strengths of the relationships that have the most impact on making changes (Sutherland 2016) . Figure 27.

University of Warwick, Yale University, Oregon University, IDM = Institute for disea se modelling In order to be fully incorporated into the EIC, examining governance changes by program would also be necessary. Although maybe integration seems optimal, there could be synergistic impacts or relational repercussions from well -established programs that co uld Page 213 of 321 inadvertently hinder progress even though well intended. This is an application that could be further developed in future EIC methodological research. There are 24 countries at risk, with 13 endemic, but only 18 representatives listed with NSSCP as of 2016. (Winkler et al. 2013) Although some countries may be near declaring status for elimination, there is still a concern that there may be foci that are still endemic and six nations with no NSSCP, it will be difficult to achieve global elimination. Additionally, with the large investments required for elimination discussed previously, some nations make opt for cost - effective programs at a lower threshold in turn leading to elimination delays. Applications of cooperation stemming from 'game theory' (Goeree & Levin 2006) could be of potential use in understanding impact of collaboration versus no collaboration globally or also how bordering countries and weak control over migrating populations could impact elimination efforts. Funding is also closely connected to governance issues. As depicted in Figure 27, financing is key part of the health system and it is important to know who the key funders are and also which components of elimination are being covered. This is often disease and treatment specific for global hea lth donations. As is with the case of HAT, the pharmaceutical companies donate their treatments, the vector control programs can provide targets at reduced costs, but the coverage of the surveillance and health care system then falls on the ministry of health or local NGOs. In order to achieve elimination it will be necessary to make sure that funds for all components of elimination programs are covered. A f unding gap analysis is also part of the EIC that has gone unanswered. To date there is still a need to ascertain is how much money is specifically be invested for HAT to understand the additional funds required . G-FINDER (Dixit & Pindyck 1994) estimates that in 2014 alone nearly 50 million was spent on R & D alone for sleeping sickness. As there seem to be enough tools necessary for elimination, perhaps R&D investments can be dive rted to elimination campaigns. This is not to say that R&D is to be stopped, but as funders are already overwhelmed by demands, should not prioritisation of funds go towards on the ground research that can contribute to elimination? R & D efforts can make more direct links to work on the field so that R&D contributes to elimination. For instance, drug trials recruit from the population at risk, contributing to reducing global number of cases and field studies with RDTs and tiny targets also simultaneously train health workers and with communities respectively. Modelling geographical at risk areas may be needed, but maybe this can be done in collaboration with collecting field surveillance Page 214 of 321 databases that can simultaneously improve information systems, survei llance coverage and be used for future epidemiological modelling forecasts. These sort of R&D endeavours should be encouraged. Overall HAT is a costly disease, so countries and programs may need to b e innovative in securing funds. E xplor ing options for fu ndraising (E.g. March of Dimes Franklin D Roosevelt) can generate global awareness and impresses funders. For example, a campaign called 'trips for tryps' could be initiated where airline companies and have passengers donate spare change, or even have a 'pop- up' advertisement when purchasing travels online that asks for a small donation. This is simply an idea, but if the campaign then approached a donor and asked them to match dollar for dollar, twice as many funds could be generated. Other funding o ptions could also include collaborating elimination projects that use tiny targets with AAT programs that often receive national funding from agricultural and /or economic departments. Additional EIC questions unanswered There are still issues related to r isk and contingency planning for failure to reach targets due to unforeseen circumstances (i.e. war, natural disaster) but also to consider formal post - elimination planning. For instance, once cases have been reduced to zero, surveillance still needs to r emain intact in the event of resurgence in a given foci. Integration with the healthcare system and improving information systems with 'triggers' would be useful so the medical professionals are able to catch 'alerts' when an outbreak begins. The operational planning and implementation still needs to be discussed. The EIC for HAT has provided several programs that could be used for elimination, but how countries will implement the scaling up of these programs on a daily basis still relies on the NS CCP. Motivation and incentives have also not yet been discussed but could be useful if addressed in an EIC. As has been shown with the forecasting, the timeline to elimination is long and in the final years uneventful. Already it has been seen that health workers in the field for HAT are demotivated and losing interest. (Thokala & Duenas 2012; Diaby et al. 2015; Diaby & Goeree 2013) Creative discussion may be needed to prevent fatigue during elimination and increase intrinsic motivation and interest. For example, countries looking to eliminate HAT could consider giving a national holiday once disease elimination is achieved. Now that the HAT EIC is complete, there will probably be a tendency to disregard the results after programs for elimination have been chosen. However, global planners should continue to monitor the forecasted outcomes, to Page 215 of 321 ensure that elimination is on track and to update the modelling to readjust the forecast as additional information becomes available. This then becomes an iterative process as is seen other health decision making processes in health impact assessment (HIA) (Uniting to Combat NTDs n.d.) or the PRUFE15 framework within the ministry of health in Ontario, Canada. (Goeree & Levin 2006) Methodology and use As this was one of the first pr ojects to formally develop an EIC, the methodology still needs to be formalized ; but given the lessons that have been learned from this project, there is a possibility now to develop formal guidelines or protocols for EIC development that are non - disease s pecific and also transferable. Instruction should also be given for appropriate timelines for the stages involved and perhaps even split the project into phases with interim deadlines. Referring again to Figure 33, the first phase could involve the evidence collection, synthesis and model development within the first 6- 18 months, with the analyses and outcomes generated in the next 6 -18 months. O utcomes should be harmo nized so that decision makers are able to prioritize across diseases as was illustrated in Table 23. Still, there remain additional analyses that could have been undertaken for the EIC . For instance , it has been mentioned that pursue further research would be worthwhile ( Chapter 5, Value of information ), but the expected value of parameter perfect information ( EVPPI ) could also be to tell decision makers which parameters should be the focus on further research. Additional ly, the EIC has a close connection to time and delays in investments for decision in elimination have not yet properly been discussed. Exploring the techniq ues available on calculating the pros and cons of delayed decisions for investors as discussed by economists (SCORE n.d.) could be of interest for further research in EICs. Financi al and societal costs outcomes for the HAT EIC were limited to a financial protection analysis and cost forecasting but productivity losses could also be considered as a formal component of the methodology. In addition, no formal budget impact analysis wa s done, but perhaps this is a method better left to national decision makers. As previously stated, if further research on EIC methodology is to continue , developing the health systems thinking and modelling component would be of use, but also broader 15 Program for Assessment of Technology in Health (PATH) reduction of Uncertainty through Field Evaluation (PRUFE) Page 216 of 321 impl ications of local settings could be considered. For instance, depending on the tropical disease, water and sanitation (WaSH) programs can have quite an impact. Ethical considerations also have been shown to highlight discordance between components of cost - effectiveness and elimination targets, but these discrepancies still need to be resolved. The EIC also has various components that allow for the possibility of a multi -criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework. (Molyneux et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2010) Usin g this approach, decision makers could decide on which components of that full analysis have greater weight (i.e. cost -effectiveness, social justice, etc.) and then after completing each assessment would receive a score for each disease based on the a prio ri weighting scheme. EICs for other NTDs investment decisions Elimination and eradication campaigns are still underway for several other diseases, (World Health Organization (WHO) n.d.) and investors committed to other disease areas are begin ning to see a need to develop elimination programs that demonstrate good value for money. The Novartis Foundation has already initiated an EIC for Buruli ulcer (Leprosy (Hansen disease)) (Hackett et al. 2014) and now Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) also plans to formally assess elimination with an EIC dossier. (Chris M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) Yet there are still many other neglected diseases that will benefit from EIC reporting (e.g. American trypanosomiasis (Chagas) , Trachoma, Soil - transmitted Helminthiasis) , and new epidemics continually on the rise in tropical environments (i.e. Ebola, Zika Virus) and these areas should be explored. 9.4 Conclusion The EIC has proven to be a useful approach that is both technically feasible and informative. However a continued development of methodology may be needed if it is to be applied to other NTDs to assist global DMs in eradicating diseases that affect the poor and improving sustainable develo pment goals ( SDGs ). The EIC for HAT has provided various options for stakeholders to move towards elimination, but f unding gaps may abound so countries may need to be innovative in securing additional funds for HAT specifically as donors may favour alterna tive diseases that appear more cost -effective according to their willingness -to-pay thresholds. I ntegration is inevitable and necessary for the advent of sustainable health systems Page 217 of 321 in the developing world, but more strategic planning in this area is needed . Health systems modelling and operational research methods show promise but may need to be explored further to see their use within an EIC. Now is the time to move forward. Although impact of delayed investment not formally assessed, delays in actions in evitably lead to delays in reaching elimination timelines. Declines in cases will be seen, but additional, continuous and sustained pressure will be required for elimination. This is not the time for lethargy or complacency in moving ahead, and global inve stors should not relax a s cases decline. To full stop transmission getting less than one case will be the most difficult as the tail end of elimination is logarithmic and tends to plateau at low numbers. There are still unanswered concerns about eliminati on, but decision makers should be c autio us to not 'over -analyse' when things just need to get done. The truth is we know what to do and we have the tools to do it,(National Institute for Health and Clinical Excelle nce (NICE) International 2014) , hence the current n eed is to put research into practise and prioritize mov ing forward instead of contemplating additional research questions. Researchers and medical professionals also need to make an effort to translate knowledge to next generation as if the hope of elimination is achieved; this will be the last generation to observe various cases, parasite and treatment, to allow for a combination of trained professionals but also younger health workers who will be around for the next half century to offer expertise. 9.5 Recommendations towards HAT elimination Immediate goals National Sleeping Sickness Control Programs (NSSCP) should select appropriate programs towards elimination with the given tools so that they can begin to secure appropriate funding and establish networks for smooth delivery of products . The WHO stakeholders for Gambiense HAT elimination could be used as an op portunity to commi t to or make a declaration of chosen elimination strategies Secure long -term funding commitments and consider additional funding innovations Surveillance needs to be improved and will probably require a combination of active and passive surveillance until the passive healthcare system is prepared to integrate Page 218 of 321 the newer technologies. Increases in surveillance coverage need to be initiated while simultaneously collecting surveillance from the field into an accurate case reporting information systems . Starts i dentifying local health centres and local NTD initiatives to partner with to be ready to integrate fexinidazole in 2018. Maximise efforts work with clinical trial people to refer cases for clinical trials and researchers work directly with new technologie s in field studies so that progress in R&D contributes to overall elimination goals. Local initiatives Scale up health workforce to have working knowledge of 'sleeping sickness' as well as differentiation between it and other febrile illness also common i n other tropical diseases.

This begins by patients reporting themselves to local health centres ( passive surveillance ) or being detected through an active screening surveillance * in his/her community. Blood serology tests using the card -agglutination trypanosomiasis test (CATT) identify suspected cases. Lumbar puncture is then performed to determine the disease stage. Patients confirmed with stage one are treated with pentamidine and stage 2 patients with nifurtomix -eflornithine combination therapy (NECT). Strategy B Control with tiny targets The same as 'Strategy A - Control' in combination with insecticide treated screens deployed across foci areas to interrupt transmission. Strategy C New technologies in 2016 The same as 'Strategy A - Control' until 2016 . At this time some cases to be treated with fexinidazole for second stage HAT as most facilities would still be implementing pentamidine for Stage 1 treatment. Diagnosis is hoped to be done with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and using loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for parasitological confirmation. Strategy D New technologies in 2016 and 2019 The s ame as 'Strategy C - New technologies in 2016' until 2019, where it is hoped that at this time a novel oral tablet (oxaborole) that can treat both stages of diseases will be available and diagnosis done with a simple RDT. Strategy E New technologies in 2016 and 2019 with tiny targets The same as 'Strategy D - New technologies in 2016 and 2019' in combination with insecticide treated screens deployed across foci areas to interrupt transmission. *This includes passive surveillance combined with annual act ive surveillance in high risk areas and passive surveillance combined with biennial surveillance in moderate risk areas. In low risk settings, active surveillance not done and reliance solely on passive surveillance. These are based on the recommendations for T.b. gambiense control outlined by WHO (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) Page 265 of 321 C.1.2 Choice of health outcomes and measurement of effectiveness The DALY was chosen as the outcome measure and cost USD per DALY averted was the item used to measure CE. Cost -effectiveness was assessed by evaluating the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER). Strategies were first aligned from lowest to highest cost, with the incremental costs and DALYs averted calculated for each strategy relative to its next best option and assessed for dominance. Th e annual prevalence, costs, time to elimination and DALYs over 30 years were calculated for each strategy by transmission area. C.1.3 Disability adjusted life years (DALY) Disability adjusted life years were calculated per diem based on traditional methods (World Health Organiz ation (WHO) n.d.) and included the years life lost in combination with the years lost to disability (YLD). YLD for stage one and two of the disease were considered to be different and estimated values were taken from a recent publication by Hackett et al.. (Hackett et al. 2014) In order to derive a value for YLLs, life expectancy was a ssumed to be 66years and the average patient age upon infection was assumed to be 25 years of age. The formula for DALY calculations is shown below. DALYs per diem = ((mu_s*Rh) + s*AhB*yldII) Where, mu_h = normal human mortality, mu_s = death related to HAT disease, mu_t = death rate, s= rate of progression to stage 2 and q= the duration of incubation And where compartments de scribed are, Sh = susceptible humans, Ih incubating humans , Ah= infective humans (stage I of disease), Rh= removed humans (due to stage II of disease) and Th = treated humans And yldI and yldII = refer to years lost to disability for stage 1 and stage 2 respectively when, yldI = dw1*(1/((r1+s+mu_h)*365)) Page 266 of 321 yldII = dw2*(1/((r2+mu_s+mu_h)*365)) The disability weights for Stage 1 ( dw1) and Stage 2 (dw2) of the disease were 0.191 and 0.81, respectively. C.1.4 Coverage rate assumptions related to surveillance The baseline values for coverage in the passive healthcare system and active screening campaigns were taken from the PNTHLA report (Programme National de Lutte Contre La Trypanosomiase Humaine Africane (PNLTHA) 2013) Active surveillance of 80.25% refers to the participation rate of a given foci. Hence, this should be interpreted as an active screening campaign covering 80% of the population in a given foci, not as a the coverage rate of foci across sub -Saharan Africa. In addition, the screening rate of f or the passive health care system of 2.46% was also taken from the PNTHLA report. (Programme National de Lutte Contre La Trypanosomiase Humaine Africane (PNLTHA) 2013) An assumption was made that new technologies would improve passive coverage due to their ease of use by factors of 3, 6.5 and 10 resulting in coverage improvements of approximately 7.4%, 16% and 25% as listed in the table below. Improvements of 5% coverage were assumed for active surveillance campaigns using motorbikes when new oral tablets (fexinidazole or Oxaborole) and rapid diagnostics become available in 2016 and/or 2019. This assumption was based on intuition from experts ( DNDi, personal communication ) that foresaw the ease of distribution and feasibility that came with the new techno logies. Recent evidence from the field also suggests that this may be even higher since the motorbike campaigns may increase coverage to nearly 100%.

When only one point estimate was found for a cost, 10% of the point estimate was assumed to be the standard deviation. In regards to equipment and vehicles, capital costs were taken from published estimates and therefore no annuititization was performed as it was assumed that this was taken into consideration by the authors who published the estimates. It is also important to note that each strategy involves different technologies during different times in the time horizon and the input parameters that were associated with each intervention were programmed in the model to switch accordingly. Case Detection (Surveillance and Diagnostics) Cost functions were developed t o calculate case detection per diem based on the surveillance strategy and diagnostic algorithm for each time horizon. Active surveillance in high transmission areas was calculated at a per diem rate annually in High transmission areas, whereas it was calc ulated bi -annually in moderate transmission areas. In low transmission areas, the costs of active surveillance were excluded. The calculations for surveillance were built on assumptions of coverage, where the coverage rates for passive and active surveill ance for stages 1 and 2 are = -log (1 -(total_cov_a))/365 Data referring to active and passive surveillance programs were calculated into per person per year, and per person for \u00bd year for bi -annual programs and then developed into various cost functions and inputted into the model. Passive costs included the total cost of creating a health Centre including: building construction, medical and lab supply, and CATT reagents, training, and other equipment.(Lutumba, Makieya, et al. 2007a) Start -up costs were calculated at the beginning of the model on a per person basis, and then a maintenance cost function was calculated annual (high risk transmission_, bi -annually (moderate risk transmission) or not at all (low risk transmission) dependin g on the risk Page 275 of 321 transmission area being modelled. Case detection and surveillance costs estimated include (Building overhead costs, Personnel, Medical and lab supply (includes CATT reagents), Essential Drugs, Stationary, Vehicle, operation and maintenance an d other operating input) It was assumed that active surveillance campaigns have some component of community sensitization included and that passive infrastructure already exists to some extent, so no initial start -up cost for building passive health care i nfrastructure was included. Annual surveillance start -up = surv_cost_startup*pop_ar Annual active surveillance maintenance = (surv_cost_pp_mob*pop_ar*rate_a1) + (cost_dtest*pop_ar*rate_a1) + Annual passive surveillance maintenance = (surv_cost_passive*pop _ar*(rate1_p1 + rate2_p1)) There have been several studies conducted regarding the diagnostic accuracy of HAT diagnostic tests. For this model, only the sensitivity estimates are included, and the results are also listed in Table 1. . The CATT algorithm a (mAECT) and LNP (Patrick Mitashi et al. 2012) while the RDT algorithms 1 was based on recent estimates from HAT Sero -K Set test(B\u00fcscher et al. 2013; B\u00fcscher et al. 2014; Jamonneau et al. 2015) and parasitology confirmation for RDT 1 using LAMP. The sensitivity of the RDT algor ithms was based on the HAT Sero -K Set test alone.

(FIND n.d.) In regards to the diag nostic test accuracy, sensitivity estimates for diagnostic tests for the CATT algorithm were taken from the published literature. (P Mitashi et al. 2012) In addition, estimates regarding the diagnostic accuracy of the rapid diagnostic were taken from a recent publication by Buscher et al,(B\u00fcscher et al. 2014) It was assumed that the current RDT algorithm and future RDT algorithm would be equally accurate. *The at risk population ( ar_pop ) in the model was approximately 100,000. This was based on the fact that 82,500 people were in the larger population with a smaller group of people migrating in from the high risk area yielding a total population of 100,000 on average. Treatment Treatment cost functions included the cost of tre atment and transportation costs (when available), also the health resource utilization (E.g. nurse time, hospital bed, etc.) by treatment regimen. All related inputs are provided in Table 2. . Costs were calculated into per patient per diem costs. Total treatment costs = (r1*Ahb*s1c) +( r2*Rhb*s2c) 'Model' for further details regarding Ahb, Rhb, Ah, and Rh. When active surveillance is on in the model active, it is assumed to include passive coverage and r1 and r2 = rate _a1; while when passive detection is on only in the model, r1 =rate1_p and r2= rate2_p. Refer to the 'Case Detection and surveillance' section for further details regarding rate_a1.

It was assumed that vector control maintenance occurred annually. The sources for costs relat ed to vector control were taken primarily from 2 recent publications by Shaw and colleagues. (Shaw et al. 2015; Shaw et al. 2013) Annual Start -up costs per km2' for Page 279 of 321 vector control were calculated upfront as capital investments, while maintenance costs were calculated on a per diem b asis in the model and totaled in the end. The annual unit costs for both large and tiny targets are provided in Table 3. The cost function for vector control in the model was calculated as follows: Vector Control Total Startup cost = (km2* vc_startup_cost *vc_units) Vector Control Maintenance = (km2*vc_maint_cost *vc_units) The total start -up cost for the large targets was based on the assumption that targets were used per km2 at a cost of $10.00 each and additional services related to starting a large target program would be $118.88 for a total of $128.88 per unit per km2 per target. Assuming that on average 10 large targets are deployed per km2, this would be a total of $1288 .80 in USD 2013. Maintenance fees for large targets were also based on estimates from Shaw et al,(Shaw et al. 2013) where annual cost for 4 and 10 traps per km were reported as $222 and $556 respectively, resulting in an annual maintenance cost of approximately $55.60 per km2 per uni t. In regards to tiny targets, start- up fees including expenditures related to preliminary surveys, sensitization, trap monitoring, target maintenance and office support resulting in a cost of $85.40 per km2 (including cost of targets, 1.1 USD each), or $1 3.8 per km2 per tiny target where there are approximately 6.2 targets per km2 (1551/250km2).(Shaw et al. 2015) Costs for annual maintenance of the vector control program for tiny targets were assumed to remain the same as setting up the program as indicated by experts in the field.(Shaw et al. 2015) (personal communication, Dr. Alexandra Shaw ) It should be noted that that different target densities and deployment rates will be used in real -world settings, (Courtin et al. 2015) resulting in variations in targets used per km2 and prices per target as negotiated by national programs. However, the current field work suggests that $85.4 is likely to remain a representative average cost per km2 across sub -Saharan Africa. ( personal communication, Dr. Alexandra Shaw ) In the model the annual costs are divided by 365 to yield a per diem cost.

These additional analyses were run for all three transmission areas. Two specific situations were run through the model to specifically evaluate implications in low risk transmission settings. For instance, currently WHO does make consideration for surveillance in low transmission areas(World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) yet the authors wanted to consider the impact that adding active surveillance in such settings would have on elimination targets and cost- effectiveness. Additionally, the base case analysis included improvements in the coverage of the passive healthcare systems that were based on the assumption that the ease of deployment would increase the availability and self -seeking patterns of symptomatic individuals suffering from Gambiense HAT. Page 281 of 321 Modelling C.4.1 Description The model used is based on the version without an animal reservoir as described in Stone & Chitnis 2015. Briefly, the equations describing the changes of numbers in human compartments (see main text) are given by: 1 =h1 + r 3Th1- hSh1 - 1,1 1() 1 Sh1(t), 1 = 1,1 1() 1 Sh1(t) - (h Ih1, 1 ( 2,11() 2+ b f ( 2,11() 2+ ,2 2() 2)Sh2(t) - 2 = Ih2 s 1Ah2- ( h+ s1+r)R = rA h2 + rR h2- (h+ t+r3) Th2. The probability of biting a human for N v1 is: ,1=(1+(1)2) (1+(1)2)+11 Page 282 of 321 where i represents the relative preference for human and non -human host types. The probability of biting a human for N v2 is: ,2=2 2+22 The forces 222+ 2 22+ 22. The ordinary differential equation s describing changes in the vector compartments (with i indicating population 1 or 2) are: = ()- vSvi(t) - vi() = vi()(+) = See Stone & Chitnis 2015(Christopher M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) for a complete description of the model, how the model was fit to low, moderate, and high transmission foci, and a table of transmission parameter values and ranges used in the model. C.4.2 Predictive accuracy We also have compared our model with the annual cas e numbers reported since 2012. The estimated sample is based on a combination of low, moderate and high transmission risk settings where it was assumed that 63% of cases were stage 1 and 37% of cases were stage 2. It was assumed that the percentage of case s reported from high, moderate and low foci were 9%, 25% and 66% respectively. This distribution is equivalent to the at risk transmission areas. (Jose R Franco et al. 2014) The mean results of 'Strategy A. Control' forecast real -world data with a R 2 = 0.85 when fitted to a linear function, and R2 = 0.98 when fitted to a polynomial function a s seen in Figure 1 below. Page 283 of 321 Figure 1.

The current approach for HAT case detection (Control - Strategy 1) relies on patients to self-report to local health centers (referred to as passive surveillance) and on active case finding done by teams that actively seek out patients living in remote areas (active surveillance). Diagnosis is done in public during in -village screening campaigns, and requires blood testing as well as a lumbar puncture to confirm the stage of disease. The current approved treatment for HAT on the WHO essential drug list for stage 1 of the disease is pentamidine while nifurtomix - eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) is the first -line, pa renteral treatment for patients who have progressed to stage 2. (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) Strategies 2 and 3 are essentially identical to control (Strategy 1) with regard to case detection and treatment; however, vector control is added with large targets (Strategy 2) or smal l targets (Strategy 3). Strategy 4 begins with control (Strategy 1) until 2016 when case detection is switched to more flexible teams on motorbikes and detection of the disease is done using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) algorithm with confirmation and staging done using the loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique (Steinmann et al. 2015) and the treatment for the second stage of disease switches to 10 oral doses of fexinidazole (Refer to Box 1). The impact of adding on vect or control is evaluated by the addition of large targets then switching to small targets (Strategy 5) or using small targets for the entire time period (Strategy 6). Strategy 7 initially is the exact same strategy as Strategy 4, up until 2019 when fexinidazole is considered for treatment of both stage 1 and 2 of the disease. Likewise, Strategy 8 is the same as Strategy 4 up until 2019, when a new compound, oxaborole, will be available for the single oral dose treatment of both stages. Strategies 9 through 12 replicate either strategy 7 or 8 by adding on vector control with large targets or switching to small targets. Based on recommendations from the WHO, (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) it was assumed that active screening was done annually in high transmission settings, bi -annually in Page 299 of 321 moderate transmission settings and no active screening component was included in the low risk transmission settings, where detection therefore relied solely on passive surveillance. Considerations were made for post -elimination activities in that it was assumed that after elimination, only passive surveillance would be implemented until 2042. Reinvasion of cases was not permitted after elimination was achieved in the model. C.7.2 Rationale for five main strategies in final manuscript The results from the CEA o f the 12 strategies, listed in Table 4 below, demonstrated that all strategies including large targets were dominated (Strategies 2, 5, 9 and 10). In addition, strategies that on only included new technologies in 2016 (Strategy 4, 5 and 6) were always domi nated by strategies that continually switched to a oral tablet for both stages. Furthermore, tiny targets with a one -time oral dose in 2019 (Strategy 12) always dominated or was equivalent to fexinidazole in combination with tiny targets. (Strategy 11) Thi s highlighted that Strategies 7, 8 and 12 were the main comparators for strategies relating to cost- effectiveness. Results for the probability of elimination analysis also showed that they each exhibited characteristics highlight gains for or against elim ination that were representative of the original 12. For this reason these four strategies were highlighted as the main options for the modelling in the manuscript, and strategy 1 and 3 were included to represent the current status quo of what is used in t he field for national sleeping sickness control programs. Strategies 1, 3, 7, 8 and 12 are referred to as ' Strategy A' , 'Strategy B ', 'Strategy C ', 'Strategy D' and ' Strategy E' respectively in the manuscript.

The ICER s included represent strategies that were cost -effective as per Sutherland et al 2017.

Hence, strategy D plus bi -annual surv eillance could be considered a CE strategy in areas where the cost -effectiveness threshold is near $650 per DALY averted or greater. Strategies (Low risk transmission) Cost DALYs ICER Strategy C, new technologies 2016 $3 0.04 Strategy A, control $3 0.04 Dominated by Strategy C Strategy D, new technologies 2016 and 2019 $3 0.03 $160 Strategy D, new technologies 2016 and 2019 +bi - annual surveillance $20 0.004 $654 Strategy E, new technologies 2016 and 2019 plus tiny targets $42 0.01 Dominated by Strategy D+ Strategy B, control with tiny targets $45 0.01 Dominated by Strategy D+ . Page 310 of 321 Therefore it was decided that 3 options could potentially be available in low transmission areas depending on cost -effectiveness thresholds and feasibility of running additional surveillance programs. In cases where there was no ICER since the strategy was the comparator, the strategy with the lowest cost was considered. Range of GNIs from impacted nations ranged from $300 to $13,000 with median near 1410. CE thresholds were selected using the GNIs of impact countries as a proxy.

It also maintains the WHO recommendations for surveillance in such areas meaning that no active surveillance is occurring in low transmission areas, whilst moderate and high transmission areas experience active screening campaigns with an average coverage rate of 80% of the 57 million people reported to be at risk (Franco et al. 2017) . Again, according to recommendations from the WHO, surveillance in moderate risk areas was simulated bi -annually and high transmission areas done annually. As the model represents three hypothetical risk transmission areas based on low, moderate and high prevalence, the annual percentage reduction of cases per year was extracted from the model respective to the three risks areas under evaluation. The estimated number of cases was then forecasted into the future using the 62 28 T.b. gambiense cases reported in 2013 across 13 endemic nations as a baseline. Estimations fro m the model and WHO reported cases up to 2014 were compared for validation of the model's predictive capacity. Forecasting estimates and current estimates for reported cases is depicted in the figure displayed in section D.3.1 of this appendix. When the me an of control strategies (with and without vector control) from 2012 to 2014 was compared to the data currently available, the model predicted cases well (R 2= 0.8301), however the available data is limited and the model's predictive ability will need to be assessed continually. Although control will reduce the number of cases over time, these reductions are expected to plateau over the next decade leading to delays in meeting elimination targets. However, if elimination strategies that include increased sur veillance in low transmission areas, innovative technologies to improve coverage or targets to interrupt vector transmission ( Elimination programs I, II and III) are implemented; the outcome would result in achieving near 2000 cases or less across Africa b y 2020. Optimal declines were . Page 311 of 321 observed in Elimination II and III, where less than 500 cases could be feasible by 2020, and also contain strategies that have the highest probability of eliminatio n (Sutherland et al, 2017). Stone & Chitnis (Chris M. Stone & Chitnis 2015) and used to calculate cost- effectiveness over time (Sutherland et al. 2017) was again used to estimate annual cases, as well as costs for treatment, vector control and surveillance. D.2.1 Health care expenditures National 'screen & treat' programs and vector control program costs Cost functions related to the expenses incurred for surveillance, treatment, diagnostics and vector control programs of T.b. gambiense were developed and incorporated into the model to generate an annual cost per person in an at risk transmission area (Sutherland et al. 2017) . These per person estimates were taken directly from t he model outputs annually and then multiplied to the at foci defined by WHO (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013c) and calculated for current at risk populations of the 14 endemic countries. The formula to represent these calculations can be described as follows: =( ++ )\u00d730 =1 Where t represents the years and are the mean costs over the 30 year time horizon. The costs for surveillance =C sur, treatment = Ctx and vector control = C vc. All are represented as units per person in an at risk focus, hence n = number of people at risk in a focus. A specific focus is represented by f for which there are three: low, moderate and high. And hence the total cost of a program is the sum of the three foci areas can be described as: = + + Mean estimate Cost $US, (SD) Sources Financial costs Surveillance Cost per person in at risk transmission area Annual surveillance 0.42 Lutumba 2007 Mobile team start -up 1.55 Lutumba 2007 Mobile teams annual maintenance 0.21 Lutumba 2007 Motorbike team start -up 0.89 Lutumba 2007 Motorbike team annual maintenance 0.42 Lutumba 2007 Passive surveillance 1.35 Lutumba 2007 Diagnostics CATT algorithm 8.19 Lutumba 2005,WHO 2006,Ndung'u 2015,FIND RDT algorithm 3.86 FIND .

Page 314 of 321 D.3.2 Out-of-pocket (OOP) Household health expenditures related to T.b. gambiense A cost function for per household OOP expenditure was then developed taking into consideration that a family member or friend would attend the treatment clinic with the diagnosed individual, and was calculated as follows: = \u00d7[ +( 30 =1\u00d7(+)) +2()+2( \u00d7 (+))] Where pi are the number of cases per stage, and c costs refer to meals ( cmeals,), a return trip for transportation to the treatment facility ( ctransportation ) and the per diem accommodation rates (caccomodation ). The per diem treatment days defined as are relative the treatment in the foreseen program (i.e. Control 2020, Elimination 2020, etc.) The average cost of treatment for stage 1 and 2 is used as a the final mean OOP costs per program (refer to the Table in D.3.3). HAT T.b. gambiense affects rural populations across Sub -Saharan Africa, hence mean consumption (C) was based on the gross national income (GNI) of the endemic nations . Non - medical expenses (NM) were estimated using food expenditures as a proxy and it was assumed on average that 66.3% of a rural household income (~ $320 annual) was spent on food expenditures (Depetris Chauvin et al. 2012) . In order to estimate the relative CHE related to OOP (shown as 'M'), the recommended methodology was used(Bank 2017) where: Short name OOP De scription Cost Source One time OOP cfee Hospital entry fees (one time) $2.52 Matemba, 2010 C trans portation Transportation (roundtrip) Days treatment Pentamidine Steinmann et al NECT 14 Steinmann et al fexinidazole 10 Steinmann et al oxaborole 1 Steinmann et al rdays Days of recovery (related to treatment) pentamidine 7 Assumption NECT 7 Assumption fexinidazole 4 Assumption oxaborole 2 Assumption . Page 315 of 321 M (CNM) To visualize the impact that OOP had on a household relative to the poverty line, a Pen Parades' diagram, was generated. This image is often used to assist policy makers in reviewing the impact that OOP may have on subjecting households to poverty (impover ishing) or pushing families with an income below the poverty line, further into poverty ('immiserizing'). .
