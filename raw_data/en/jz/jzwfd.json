The artisan distilling industry in Michigan is poised to undergo signicant expansion in the next few years resulting in positive economic impact for the state. Challenges for the entrepreneurs entering this business are access to technological expertise and facilities to develop and market products. An additional complication of the distilled spirits industry lies in the regulations governing it. Unlike beer and wine, there is no minimum amount of spirits that can be produced without Federal and State licenses. Furthermore, it is required to have constructed an operational distillery in order to apply for a Federal license. These regulations place the potential new producer in the position that in order to attract investment it is necessary to produce products and show their market value, but to do so,it is necessary to have the investment in a plant to get a license. We work to break this cycle by assisting new entrepreneurs in development and marketing of their spirits in order to attract the required investment for construction of their own facility. Upgrading forest byproducts. Xylose derived from hemicellulose is a low-cost source of substrate for butyric acid fermentation given that extraction could be integrated into current industrial pulp and paper processes yielding hemicellulosic sugars for the fermentation while retaining the properties of the cellulose fraction to be used in the subsequent pulp production. One of the main issues concerning such an integration is that hydrolysis of hardwood hemicellulose releases not only xylose but also acetic acid (up to 40 g/L), a microbial inhibitor. To achieve biologically conversion of xylose to butyric acid, the inhibiting acetic acid must either be removed from the extraction broth or the fermentation strain adapted to tolerate such high levels. This study focuses on the impact of high levels of acetic acid on C. tyrobutyricum fermentation growth kinetics and product yields in order to establish a process with extracted xylose as a substrate without requiring the removal of the toxic acetic acid from the broth. nrecent publications N.

This will enable development of optimal material processing strategies to gain more predictable and reliable properties. Four examples follow: Damage nucleation in titanium and titanium alloys . Figure 1 shows computational deformation of a bicrystal that is oriented to enable slip transfer from a prism slip system (blue grain) that is perfectly aligned with a pyramidal slip system (red grain). While uniaxial tension is applied to the bicrystal, the restrictions of the anisotropic slip systems causes the stress state to deviate signifi cantly from uniaxial tension. The left grain sees a stress state closer to uniaxial tesion and the right crystal is closer to biaxial tension. Normal crystal plasticity models allow slip transfer across grain boundaries by all slip systems. When slip is restricted on all except the one that is well-aligned, the magnitude of the stress is actually reduced (color scale on the right) and the shape of the stress tensor changes (glyphs). This provides evidence that more physically realistic deformation at grain boundaries can be installed into larger scale simulations. DOE/BES SISGR Grant, with M.A. Crimp, C.J. Boehlert, and P.

(MSU: TEC2015-0132) ncurrent research The research group of Materials Science and Engineering Professor Boehlert is concentrating on understanding the deformation behavior of hexagonal close packed metals, in particular titanium and magnesium alloys, under extreme environments. The environments include a combination of both elevated temperatures and irradiation, and a variety of loading conditions are being used to mimic component use in commercial applications. In situ testing methods have been developed which allow for characterizing the surface deformation behavior during deformation in order to understand the deformation evolution. Boehlert's group also researches severe plastic deformation processing eff ects on nanostructured zinc-magnesium alloys targeted for biomedical implant applications, where the biocompatible zinc-magnesium alloy will degrade in the body aft er achieving it function. Below provides a brief description of one of the research programs in Boehlert's group: Titanium (Ti) alloys have been used in diverse fi elds, such as aerospace, biomedical, energy, and chemical equipment, due to their combination of good mechanical properties, chemical and oxidation resistance, and biocompatibility. Furthermore, Ti alloys have been used for elevated temperature structural applications, such as in jet engine parts, and power plant equipment. However, the elevated-temperature strengths of Ti alloys has not exceeded those for superalloys, which are currently the preferred choice. Nickel-base and cobalt-based superalloys have benefi cial properties and are currently being used in the compressor sections of turbine engines and other sections of turbine engines. However, their density is approximately 8 gm./cm 3. The density of the Ti alloys are approximately 4.5 gm/cm3. Thus a signifi cant reduction in weight is possible if a Ti alloy can be used in aircraft and other structural applications. This will result in energy savings and a reduction in fuel use and can ultimately lead to cost savings as well. Moreover, many other industries looking for low-cost, high-strength, and corrosion-resistant materials, such as chemical process, petroleum, biomedical, and sport goods industries, could benefi t. Boehlert's research group is investigating the plastic deformation behavior of Ti-chromium-iron-aluminum (TCFA) alloys at the microscale using in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tensile loading in conjunction with electron backscattered diff raction (EBSD) analysis. The infl uence of temperature on the strength was also studied. Tensile tests were performed at temperatures ranging from room-temperature (RT) to 500\u00b0C inside a SEM to characterize the deformation evolution. Slip trace analysis was performed using the EBSD data. In this work, a new method was introduced which results in strengthening a TCFA alloy through a thermomechanical processing (TMP) induced phase transformation. The results indicated that the elevated temperature strength was signifi cantly higher than the RT strength, i.e., the RT strength was 940 MPa, while the strength was 1435 MPa at 410\u00b0C. The transmission electron microscopy, in situ SEM tensile experiments, and dynamic mechanical analysis investigations revealed that TMP-induced phase transformation plays an essential role in this strengthening. It was observed that the RT properties are also enhanced by this TMP-induced process. The preliminary results indicate that a phase transformation (from the phase to the hexagonal -phase structure) is responsible for this strengthening. The literature suggests this transformation can be athermal or thermally activated in nature and it has resulted in exceptional strengthening in other Ti alloys at RT. However in those cases, the -phase transformation was obtained through heat treatment alone. Boehlert's group has observed this strengthening when the material is subjected to an applied tensile stress at elevated temperature (400-500\u00b0C). They have also observed this transformation aft er both 410\u00b0C heat treatments and RT tensile deformation to 7% strain followed by heat treatment at 410\u00b0C for 24 hours. Thus, this transformation can be induced by heat treatment and it can be accelerated by a combination of deformation and heating. The preliminary transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations have department of chemical engineering & materials science | 5indicated that nanoscale -phase precipitates are formed within the -phase matrix (see Figure 1). Boehlert's group is currently analyzing scanning transmission electron microscopy results to characterize the chemical segregation within the two phases. It is noted that the elongation-to-failure values at 410\u00b0C are greater than 10%. However it is unclear whether the resulting microstructure will be brittle at RT. To summarize, Boehlert's group has applied for an interna- tional patent on the thermomechanical processing treatment that results in exceptional strengthening of metastable beta TCFA alloys. These low-cost titanium alloys display exceptional tensile strength at RT and up to 1.75 times higher tensile nrecent publications C. Zhang, S. Balachandran, P. Eisenlohr, M.A. Crimp, C. Boehlert, R.

Activity approaches that of precious-metal platinum in acid and alkaline electrolytes.

Using our model, we have identied opportunities to optimize the design for improved performance, including reduced catalyst layer thickness and increased hydrophobicity of catalyst layer materials (fi gure 2). Bio-inspired design of adaptive catalysis cascades. As new catalytic systems are created for the production of advanced materials, energy conversion and harvesting, and human/machine interfaces, it is clear that natural pathways provide essential clues that will inspire novel designs. In this collaboration we are developing integrated catalytic cascades created from diff erent catalytic modalities to optimize selectivity, electron transfer, diff usion, and overall pathway flux. The contribution of our laboratory is to quantitatively model the coupling of these novel catalytic steps and to study the transport of intermediates between steps (fi gure 3). Electrospun nanobers for transition metal electrocatalalysis and bioelectrocatalysis. Introduction of non-precious electrocatalysts to electrochemical processes is plagued by poor transport properties owing to the large catalyst loading of relatively low-activity catalysts. We are to developing two classes of electrocatalysts based on electrospun carbon nanobers. Electrospinning is a well-established, industrial-scale process producing carbon bers with diameters ranging from 100 nm to over 1 micron and can be engineered with a range of structural, morphological, and surface properties figure 3.

We implement these materials in two ways: (a) as precursor materials for preparation of metal-nitrogen-carbon (MNC) electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction, and (b) as support materials for preparation of enzymatic bioelectrodes. MNC electrocatalysts have applicability to low-temperature fuel cells for transportation and portable power.

Numerous diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, involve malfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Physiological conditions such as elevated levels of saturated long chain-FFAs, e.g., palmitate, have been shown to induce ER stress in many types of cells, and to contribute to the development of these ER stress-associated diseases. We found that palmitate promotes the dimerization of inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1), an ER stress sensor protein, through the Trp457 residue in the transmembrane domain of IRE1 (fi gure 1). This study will impact the design of therapeutics that target the ER stress response in treating metabolic dysfunction, as well as the design and development of drug therapies that target ER stress-associated diseases, including cancers, Alzheimer's disease and many other diseases. Delivery of siRNAs by polymeric nanoparticle (collaborator: S. Patrick Walton). The overall goal of the proposed research is to design vehicles with optimal chemical and physical characteristics. The interactions of siRNAs with delivery vehicles built from chemically-diverse oligomeric and polymeric nanoparticles are quantitatively analyzed to determine those structural features that encourage complex formation and release of siRNAs into the cell. Neural transdiff erentiation of stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells exhibiting a high proliferation rate and plasticity as compared to other adult stem cell lines. MSCs naturally serve as precursors for adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes, and provide trophic support for cells of the immune system in the bone marrow. In vitro experiments have shown that MSCs can be induced to gain characteristics of neural cells including generation of Na+K+ currents, expression of neural specifi c structural proteins, and exhibition of neuronal morphology upon induction. Previously, we demonstrated that and IBMX, induced neural-like diff erentiation of MSCs, including expression of neural markers and increased sensitivity to neurotransmitters. However, due to the broad range of eff ects that forskolin and IBMX can elicit through the intracellular second messenger, cAMP, a better mechanistic understanding is required. Recently, we show that neural induction by forskolin and IBMX is dependent on downregulation of expression of the master transcriptional regulator, neuron restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), and its downstream target genes. Since silencing of NRSF is known to initiate neural diff erentiation, we found forskolin and erentiation of MSCs into a neural lineage (fi CRISPR to increase the homogeneity and effi ciency of stem cell diff erentiation. Stem cells are a promising cell source for the regeneration of aged, injured and diseased tissues and organs, but to realize their therapeutic potential challenges remain, including restricting the growth of unwanted cell types and improving the effi ciency of converting them to a specifi c cell type, and thereby render them safer to use.

Understanding the structure-property relationships of polymeric materials are crucial to design novel polymeric materials on demand. The Dynamics and Mechanics of Soft Materials group are interested in the dynamics of multicomponent polymeric materials at diff erent times and lengths scale, and their correlation to the microscopic properties. Currently, we are pursuing the structure-property relationship of multi-component polymeric materials from dynamics and mechanics perspective of view. Dynamics and mechanics of polymers at interfaces. Polymers adsorbing onto a surface can form a variety of diff erent microstructure such as trains, loops, and tails. Structurally, the population of each microstructure at the interfacial region varies with the polymer molecular weights, the polymer-nanoparticle interactions, and so forth. The complicated surface conditions have strong impacts on the structure and dynamics of interfacial polymers. For example, the polymer adsorption is typically known as an irreversible process with extremely long lifetime. So far, there are no experimental methods that enable one to eff ectively study the dynamics of polymers at the interface, especially the slow modes like the Rouse, sub-Rouse, and diff usion of interfacial polymers. In this project, we focus on the polymer structure and dynamics at the polymer/nanoparticle interface. With a combination of dielectric spectroscopy and rheology, we aim to understand the correlation between the properties of the interfacial layer of a few nanometers and the macroscopic properties of polymer nanocomposite, i.e., the mechanism of nano-reinforcement. Advanced polymer nanocomposites design. Recently, we have demonstrated that small nanoparticles are much more eff ective in tuning macroscopic properties of PNCs than conventional big nanoparticles, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in PNCs design (Fig. 3). The advanced macroscopic properties of small nanoparticle PNCs (s-PNCs) include a large shift in glass temperature (~10\u00d7 larger than conventional nanoparticle PNCs (c-PNCs)), an unexpectedly high fragility index (up to 270), a high threshold of kinetic gelation (> 40 vol%), an apparent \"fully disentanglement\" of polymers with molecular weight of 100 kg/mol, and a processing favorable zero-shear viscosity. We proposed the origin of the large eff ects as (i) a fi nite desorption time between the small nanoparticle and polymer segment; (ii) the high mobility of the nanoparticles; (iii) the small sizes. This discovery opens new routes of tuning the macroscopic properties of PNCs. In this project, we aim to extend the newly discovered strategy to design novel high-performance figure 2. Rheo-dielectrics to probe the dynamics of interfacial polymers under active deformation. Special attention will be paid to the two types of events here: (i) forced polymer-nanoparticle detachment, (ii) force disentanglement between adsorbed polymers and their adjacent chains.figure 1. left: A sketch of chain conformations (microstructures) of polymer nanocomposite with low molecular weight.

The search and design of new polymer glasses with high modulus, high toughness, and high resistance to failure that can replace metals and ceramics is a long-lasting topic. Despite decades of intensive study, our understanding of the mechanics of polymer glasses is still limited, far behind market demands.

The group works on a range of interdisciplinary projects that deal with diff raction based imaging approaches, based on both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). While the core research programs in this group deal with advancing the understanding of deformation and fracture in structural metals, collaborative studies have included magnetic multilayer structures, carbon nanotubes, ceramic joining, oxygen sensors, and cholesterol. Characterization of deformation structures using scanning electron microscopy. Enhancing the performance of metals and alloys used in structural applications requires an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to strength, toughness, and in particular, damage nucleation that leads to failure. For many years these mechanisms have been characterized usingTEM, but this approach is limited by the need to use very thin samples with small fi elds of views. Here at MSU we have been at the forefront in the development of SEM approaches that allow the direct imaging and crystallographic characterization of deformation structures in the near surface regions of bulk samples using electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) (fi gure 1). Characterization of heterogeneous deformation in poly- crystalline arrays using ECCI. The reliability of engineering structures is oft en limited by the development of local damage during processing or service. Such damage can oft en be traced back to the heterogeneous deformation that is inherent in polycrystalline metals. Thus, in order to optimize the performance of structural materials, it is critical to characterize the nature of deformation in these polycrystals, particularly at in grain boundaries. We have recently developed a new ECCI based approach for such characterization that allows identifi cation of grain boundary dislocation nucleation sites as well as the manner in which dislocation slip bands interact with grain boundaries (fi gure 2). Using this approach, we are identifying how diff erent polycrystalline arrays may be more or less susceptible to damage nucleation, with an aim figure 1.

There are currently over seven billion people on the planet and another two billion are expected in the next few decades. Therefore food production must expand signifi cantly and soon. But current food production practices tend to deplete soil and degrade water supplies. Modern agriculture uses large quantities of fossil energy both directly and indirectly and is thereby a major greenhouse gas emitter. Modern agriculture also depends heavily on synthetic pesticides and herbicides with many resulting adverse environmental eff ects. Lack of energy access is at the root of human poverty. To provide energy services that will lift people from poverty we must also rapidly expand energy production. But about 85% of current energy use is based on fossil energy. If we expand energy production based on fossil energy resources, we will accelerate buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gases at the very time when we should instead be removing large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it in stable forms. Agriculture is an industry, and like other industries, agriculture must be fi nancially healthy if it is to innovate and become more sustainable.

How will agriculture to innovate and become more sustainable if it does not have the required cash fl ow? Large scale, sustainable bioenergy production might provide the additional income. However, we will not solve linked problems by addressing them in isolation. We must address linked problems as an integrated whole, using \"win-win\" approaches. These unsustainable, strongly linked trends in food and energy production must be addressed now. We do not have decades to wait for \"perfect\" solutions. We need proven, scalable, sustainable approaches now. We can improve and innovate on these approaches as we proceed, but it is time to implement large scale, sustainable, \"no-regrets\" approaches to integrated food and energy production. I am currently contributing to two eff orts to sustainably integrate food and energy production. One is using the ammonia fi ber expansion (AFEX) process to produce high quality ruminant animal feeds from low quality straws and hay. AFEX-treated straws can also be used as feedstocks for producing biofuels such as ethanol. With support from the Gates Foundation, the AFEX process is now being scaled up to produce dairy animal feeds in India. The additional milk production enabled by the AFEX treatment will provide enough income to potentially lift millions of poor Indian families from poverty. The second approach to integrated food and energy production is called Biogasdoneright, or BDR. BDR is a set of linked practices for sustainable on-farm production of food linked with both production and conservation of energy. BDR depends on double-cropping to produce energy crops for anaerobic digestion. These energy crops represent additional carbon extracted from the global carbon cycle. Energy crops, plus crop residues, manures and agrowastes, are converted to biogas, electricity or biomethane. Stable carbon and plant nutrients are recycled to the soil through the residual digestate stream to reduce farmer costs and sequester carbon in the soil. The BDR approach with its many linked \"win-win\" outcomes is summarized in Figure 1.

Shaw Lane, Room 3520 nresearch interests Computational materials science, mechanics of microstructured nwebsite equipment available Dedicated computer clusters at the MSU High Performance Computing Center ngroup members phd prediction of advanced structural material performance by considering interactions of microstructure and plasticity in crystalline solids. In our daily life, we heavily rely on the mechanical capacity and integrity of many diff erent materials. For most structural materials of technological relevance, the mechanical behavior is intricately infl uenced by their chemistry (alloying in the case of metals) but even more importantly by their microstructure. The latter is strongly impacted by processing conditions and, hence, can be substantially manipulated through processing. This complexity makes the prediction of the (thermo-) mechanical behaviorof existing materials and the design of new materials andtheir required microstructures for targeted properties a remarkable challenge that is addressed at the Computational Materials Mechanics (CMM) lab by Eisenlohr and his group. We tap into the resources off ered by the High Performance Computing Center (HPCC) and the Division of Engineering Computing Services (DECS) to simulate material deformation with commercial and homemade open-source soft ware. In our simulations, we investigate the mechanisms of deformation occurring at mesoscopic scales and connect them to the material microstructure. By this we seek, for instance, to (1) understand basic aspects of plastic deformation in crystals, (2) identify critical confi gurations in polycrystals or multiphase materials that might trigger nucleation of internal damage, and (3) predict the inherently anisotropic behavior of structural materials with complex microstructure at the scale of engineering components. As an overarching theme, we seek to advance the forward modeling and associated simulation methodologies necessary to understand the properties of materials with (complex) microstructure and by that facilitate the solution of the inverse problem posed by the search for a microstructure that meets a given property demand. A current example of ongoing research is: Identifying the origins of whisker formation in tin fi lms. The spontaneous growth of tin (Sn) whiskers from tin coatings, which are frequently used due to their favorable properties such as excellent solderability, ductility, electrical conductivity, and corrosion resistance, is a serious concern to the electronic industry as these long fi lament-like structures pose a major risk of short-circuiting. Especially aft er lead (Pb), an alloying element that previously suppressed whisker growth, was banned in consumer electronics due to environmental hazards, understanding and mitigating whisker formation is of renewed interest. Current models of whisker formation simplify the fi lm geometry into one dimension, partly consider plastic relaxation mechanisms, prescribe the stress condition surrounding a predetermined whisker grain, and are fi tted to reproduce observed whisker growth rates. Yet none of those models can be regarded as predictive, since many open and critical aspects of whisker formation are not explicitly addressed by them. First and foremost, the specifi c conditions that trigger particular grains to grow a whisker are ignored and cannot be deduced from the simulation results. Secondly, the long-range stress gradient that is predicted to develop around a whisker grain has not been observed in highly resolved x-ray diff raction studies. figure 1. Spatial variability of hydrostatic stress p in the vicinity of grain boundaries at three diff erent fi lm depth (surface to substrate from left to right). Substrate is not shown while part of the columnar grain structure of the tin fi lm is illustrated at the far back and is colored according to the crystallographic direction that is parallel to the surface normal (close to <1 0 0] in this example, see color code in standard stereographic triangle).department of chemical engineering & materials science | 21 nrecent publications T.

Spatial maps refl ect fi lm layer closest to the substrate with the transformed grain shown in orange. Moreover, geometrically simplifi ed models disregard the elastic and plastic anisotropy of Sn, hence, cannot account for measured infl uences of the global grain orientation distribution (crystallographic texture) on whisker propensity. Since whisker nucleation is ultimately a local phenomenon , specifi cs of the whisker grain neighborhood in terms of geometry and crystal orientations are very likely decisive factors. We perform thermo-mechanically coupled full-fi eld crystal plasticity simulations of tin fi lms on an isotropic rigid substrate to investigate the infl uence of crystallographic texture, grain size distribution, and presence of oblique grains on the development of hydrostatic stress within the fi lm, in particular within the network of grain boundaries, as that is the path for atom redistribution considered to be ultimately decisive for whisker formation. The exemplary results illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate that a highly fl uctuating hydrostatic stress fi eld emerges under thermal strain that is infl uenced by the texture but essentially independent of the grain size distribution or the presence of non-columnar grain shapes. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a whisker nucleates where low compressive stress relative to its immediate grain neighborhood occurs, a condition that appears to be predominantly determined by the crystallographic orientation distribution of the fi lm.michigan state university college of engineering 22 |Elias Garratt Assistant Professor garratte@msu.edu | 517.432.8709 | 1449 Engineering Research Court, Room C138 nresearch interests Hierarchical material structure, electronic materials, scanning Measurement and Analytics nwebsite deep ultraviolet photoluminescence microscope ngroup members Shengyuan Bai, Yun Hsiung ncurrent research The aim of this group is to use hyperspectral imaging to understand the process-structure-property relationships of materials. Current eff orts focus on using microscale x-ray diff raction (-XRD) to map crystal orientation, domain, and stress in single crystal diamond grown using microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. This understanding can translate to the development of new methods to control growth parameters and manipulate lattice orientations of diamond to yield electronics-grade large single crystal wafers. Diamond growth. Our goal in studying diamond is to understand the physical mechanisms which lead to diamond wafer outgrowth and fracture. For diamond to be realized in devices such as power converters, heat spreaders, or radiation detectors their lateral dimensions need to expand beyond the typical 10\u00d710 mm. Much is already understood about the diamond lattice structure. Growth is understood to take place as a combination of surface etching and rebuilding, creating favorable, highly stable lattice points exposed by etching on which constituent atoms of CH 3 may attach, propagating overall growth along specifi c lattice planes. In this highly dynamic environment, researchers have noted the formation of 1D and 2D defects is not uncommon but have learned to suppress them through surface engineering, i.e., miscuts relative to the primary growth facets of (100) or (110) resulting in a step-fl ow overgrowth scheme. Surface engineering of diamond now off ers a path forward to growing wafer-sized diamond through converging lateral surfaces, however, the interaction of crystals at these junctures is not well understood. Our group works closely with the Fraunhofer Center for Coatings and Diamond to conduct research to leverage their expertise with industrial scalable growth techniques. The primary method to grow electronics grade diamond is with microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition reactors, of which the Fraunhofer center houses eight separate reactors for doped and un-doped single crystal diamond growth. In the reactor, a transverse standing wave is established with a node directly above the substrate crystal surface. Within the same volume, methane and hydrogen gasses are pressurized in a quartz bell jar and the interaction of the pressurized gases and microwaves produces a 2000\u00b0C ball of hydrogen and carbon dimers. At the surface of the substrate, these particles interact to actively etch and attach to the surface, forming covalent carbon bonds ultimately resulting in a diamond crystal lattice. -XRD. Crystal structural information can be obtain in a variety of ways using electron, x-ray, neutron, and ion probes at multiple length scales. To gain insight into how large, scalable processes like microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor it is ideal to collected microstructural information of millimeter and larger length scales. Structural information typically derived from XRD comes from bulk samples at millimeter length scales with a millimeter-sized x-ray beam spot. This inhibits the ability to probe structural information such as domain size and orientation relative to the surrounding microstructure, essentially averaging out this information within the probe spot size on target. -XRD follows conventional XRD except the ultimate beam spot on target is only hundreds of microns in diameter, a condition created through strong anisotropic beam scattering to reduce beam spread and subsequent collimation. A fi ve-axis Eulerian cradle with and rotation and XY scanning enables us to render 2D spatial maps of the crystal domain, orientation, texture, and stress and strain. Further, the modularity of the system allows for swapping of diff erent components, giving us an extremely sensitive and versatile tool. The applications of the system promise to expand far beyond diamond materials. figure 1. Single crystal diamond sample during growth in microwave plasma reactor.

Through correlative measurements with XRD and other techniques, both visible white light and UV range, off er the ability to detect optically active centers contained in crystal lattices (composition), lattice strain along specifi c crystallographic directions, and surface topography. Birefringence is a well-known technique to study the quality of materials for transmission of electromagnetic radiation. Incident light is initially polarized, then passed through the target material and an analyzing polarizer before fi nally detected. For imperfect crystals light interaction will result in a rotation of the polarization vector during its transit through the crystal, resulting in detection of the rotated light. When combined with knowledge of the crystal orientation, this method can reveal in seconds the relative anisotropy of crystal strain relative to specifi c lattice orientations. Instrumentation expected to be added this year will include photoluminescence. A technique by which the excitation of lattice atoms using light can reveal compositional information about the material. abmichigan state university college of engineering 24 |Krishnamurthy Jayaraman Professor jayarama@egr.msu.edu | 517.355.5138 | 428 S.

Recently our research eff ort has centered around Solid-state Ionic Conductors (SIC) and Solid-state Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors (SMIEC) as battery electrolytes/ electrodes and thermoelectric (TE) materials. SIC, SMIEC, and TE compounds are all complex materials with a framework-guest structure and unique ionic and electronic properties. The guest atoms in SIC and SMIEC are able to diff use or conduct, while the framework is insulating (SIC) or semiconducting (SMIEC) for electrons, respectively. The guest atoms in TE are rattlers while the framework is semiconducting for electrons. The complexity of these materials calls for techniques known to both crystallographers and non-crystallographers. We are applying a suite of average and local structure and dynamics probes to understand their fundamental structure-property relationships. Ongoing projects include: Structure and dynamics of lithium-stuff ed garnet oxides. State-of-the-art Li-ion batteries utilize organic solvent based liquid electrolytes that usually have limited electrochemical stability and are also volatile and fl ammable. Lithium- stuff ed garnet oxides are a new nonfl ammable solid electrolytes with high lithium ionic conductivities. The framework of the materials is composed of LaO 8 dodecahedra and TaO 6 octahedra. There are two types of cages, tetrahedral (Td) and octahedral (Oh), to host lithium ions. Each Td cage is surrounded by four Oh cages and each Oh cage is surrounded bytwo Td cages. Both the Td and Oh cages are only partially occupied. We are investigating a prototypic series of lithium-stuff ed garnet oxides Li 7-xLa3Zr2-xTaxO12 (x = 0-2).

Wire bonding is a key packaging technology to achieve the electrical and mechanical interconnections between integrated circuit and the metal frame in printed circuit board. Recently, copper (Cu) has gained popularity over gold (Au) as the wire material based on cost reduction and higher performance. Two major intermetallics (IMCs), (CuAl 2) and (Cu 9Al4), are oft en found in the Cu-Al bonding interface aft er the as-bonded structure undergoes thermal aging for extended periods of time. Galvanic corrosion for this Cu///Al metallic-intermetallic \"sandwich\" structure, may take place when dissimilar metals are brought into electrical contact in the presence of an electrolyte containing corrosive species. In the service environment, moisture absorbed by the molding compound can dissolve a small amount of halogens (Cl -, Br-) used in the synthesis of molding compound and act as the electrolyte to initiate galvanic corrosion. Several studies have reported that the mechanical failure resulted from the disappearance of and failure occurred at the wire side. The use of Pd-coated Cu wire had shown to enhanced service reliability. It was suggested that the enhanced service reliability maybe due to the nobility of Pd addition, however, no systematic electrochemical characterization has been carried out for each of the entities in Cu(Pd)-Al bonding interface, which is essential to understand corrosion behavior of Cu(Pd)-Al bonding interface. Using open circuit potentials and potentiodynamic polarization measurements systemic investigate were performed on all the undoped/Pd-doped samples (Cu, , ) in diff erent pH, Cl - concentration and temperatures to provide a complete picture of electrochemical behavior needed to understand the service reliability of wire boned electronic packages. Electrochemical characteristic of metals were examined using cathodic and anodic polarization curves. Both E corr and i corr are determined by the thermodynamics (reversible potentials: E(M/Mn+), E(O Tafel constants) of the two half-cell reactions. The addition of Pd increases the cathodic current density by increasing the exchange current density for ORR, and reduces the anodic current density by the induced passivation. This upward shift on the cathodic polarization curve, as well as the downward shift on the anodic polarization curve, led to an increase in the value of E corr. However, the change in the value of i corr depends on the relative amount of shift between cathodic and anodic polarization curves. As shown in Figure 1(a), the upward shift in the cathodic polarization curve was more than the downward shift in the anodic polarization, the value of icorr will increase, which meaning a faster rate of corrosion. This was the case when only small amounts of Pd addition in Cu. To reduce the value of i corr, it was necessary that the amount of downward shift be greater than the amount of upward shift , fi gure 1(b). Therefore, a higher amount of Pd was needed to reduce the corrosion rate. figure 1. Determination of E corr and i corr of g using polarization curves.

Aluminum (Al) based casting alloys have been used as light-weighting materials in the automotive industry for decades. Further weight reduction has been introduced in the automotive body construction recently with the use of structural aluminum. However, without modication, most of Al casting alloys have poor ductility, and does not meet the structural application requirement, i.e., at least 12% elongation to failure. Although, the addition of Na or Sr can spheroidize Si cuboids, and the addition of Ti and B reduce the grain size of primary aluminum phase in Al-Si based casting alloys. However, these modications had some drawbacks needed to overcome, such as coarsening with aging as well as fading with repeated melting. Polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxanes (POSS) are silsequioxane-based nano-structural chemicals. These chemicals are cage like structures with repeated monomer units of RSiO 1.5 where Si is the element silicon, O is oxygen and R is hydrocarbon group, e.g., ethyl, isobutyl, phenyl etc. Partial cage-like POSS have the thermal stability in the molten aluminum and the silanol (Si-OH) functionalities form thermodynamically stable Si-O-M bonds with metals (e.g., Al). These nano-sized silanol compounds provide nucleation sites during solidication as grain rener, and also serve as obstacles for preventing coarsening at elevated temperatures for microstructural stability of Al alloys. A4047 and A4047 powders with and without POSS trisilanol added were used to make ingots for metallographic study. Figure 2 shows the optical micrographs of the ingots made of 325 mesh A4047 powders without and with POSS trisilanol addition, respectively. A4047 has a near-eutectic Al-Si composition with primary Al phase and eutectic Si-Al phase. Figure 2 ( left ) displays the microstructure of A4047 without POSS trisilanol, which is typical from a slow-cooled ingot with Al dendrite and lamellar Si cuboids. With the addition of POSS trisilanol, under the same casting and cooling congurations, the Si platelets are broken down to very ne spheroidized phase, as shown in fi gure 2 ( right ). The microstructure added also leads signicant benet in the mechanical property of A4047. Tensile tests were conducted on the tensile bars machined from the ingots. It was found that the elongation to failure had increased with POSS trisilanol addition, with percentage increase from 23% to 250% over the control sample (without POSS trisilanol added). In addition, the ultimate tensile strength did not decrease with the benet of increases in the elongation to failure. Currently we are exploring diff erent approaches for produce master alloys with diff erent Si contents from hypoeutectic to hypereutectic Al-Si casting alloys. figure 2.

The Lira Research group is fascinated by characterizing these relatively common properties for pure components and mixtures, and the way the chemical structure determines these properties. When an alternative fuel is developed and blended with petroleum fuel, what are the cold flow properties? What is the eff ect on the boiling curve?

Improved association-based models for separations in the bioeconomy. With industrial focus moving to bioderived feedstocks, the need for improved process modeling is acute; conventional models with adjustable parameters do not correlate data accurately enough for extrapolations in temperature or to new compositions. Thus, precise process design for streams with these components requires many experimental measurements and expensive, slow pilot-plant studies.

This project is developing improved models that include meaningful representation of hydrogen bonding of oxygen-containing molecules. Popular predictive and correlative models (UNIFAC, NRTL) do not use the correct functional form to represent hydrogen bonding.

This is accomplished by exploiting the excitonic character of molecular and organic semiconductors that leads to \"oscillator bunching\" exhibiting uniquely distinct absorption spectra from the band-absorption of traditional inorganic semiconductors. Next-generation organic light emitting diodes for lighting. An important route to the reduction of green gasses lies in energy utilization. In particular, lighting accounts for about 17% of the total energy consumption in buildings. State of the art white organic light emitting diodes (WOLEDs) are currently poised to make reductions in this consumption rate for lighting as power effi ciencies greater than that of fl uorescent lighting have been demonstrated. However, WOLEDs are currently limited by external quantum effi ciencies (EQE) of ~20% due to waveguided modes and are reliant on precious metal (Pt and Ir) containing phosphorescent dopants. To circumvent these shortcomings we are designing the next-generation devices based on phosphorescent nanostructured and abundant molecular materials. Understanding organic epitaxy. The presence of excitons in organic semiconductors at room temperature distinguish them from traditional semiconductors, providing exceptional opportunities for manipulating energy in a range of structures from light emitting diodes, lasers, transparent photovoltaics, and optical switches. However, control over crystalline order, orientation, and defect formation are crucial to the fabrication and optimization of these excitonic electronics. The overarching goal of understanding organic epitaxy is to explore bottom-up vapor-deposition routes to the growth of large-area organic and molecular crystalline fi lms with enhanced properties.michigan state university college of engineering 36 |Dennis Miller Professor millerd@egr.msu.edu | 517.353.3928 | 428 S.

US Patent #9,090,556 (7/28/2015). ncurrent research The supplementing of America's abundant fossil resources with fuels and chemicals derived from biomass remains important for generation of economic opportunities and for fostering national energy independence. In the laboratories of the Miller group, cutting-edge technology in heterogeneous catalysis and advanced processing is implemented to eff ectively convert biomass and biomass-derived intermediates to chemical products and fuels that compete with petroleum-based products in the current socio-economic environment. The Miller group has examined a number of chemical systems directed at energy and materials production from renewable feedstocks. These have included the catalytic upgrading of biomass platform intermediates, mainly produced in fermentation processes, with the goal of building technical capabilities for the emerging biorenery. In most cases, the overarching goal of the catalytic chemistry is deoxygenation of the biomass intermediate to a product that replaces a petroleum-derived counterpart. Classes of platform intermediates include carboxylic acids, sugar alcohols, linear alcohols, furanic compounds, and other derivatives; because these platform intermediates are typically of low volatility and are less thermally stable than their petroleum analogs, we have developed expertise in carrying out catalysis at mild temperatures under elevated hydrogen pressures in aqueous solution. The ability to design and prepare catalysts, characterize reaction pathways, and monitor chemical reaction kinetics have led to signicant interactions with industrial partners, national laboratories, and agricultural groups. The Miller group has partnered with the MSU engine group in mechanical engineering to produce and test advanced biofuels for internal combustion engines. Moving past today's rst generation ethanol and biodiesel, emphasis has been placed on developing advanced biofuels with enhanced engine performance, high energy density, and storage and flow properties that facilitate their use as direct replacements for petroleum-derived fuels. department of chemical engineering & materials science | 37GLYCEROL ADVANCED \"Enhanced acrylate production L.

One column is glass for atmospheric pressure and vacuum operation; the second is stainless steel for elevated pressure studies. Reactive distillation is well-suited for reaction systems that are limited by chemical equilibrium, as the removal of one product by distillation allows the reaction to be driven to completion within the column.

Currently, two main thrusts or our research are (1) investigation of new thermoelectric materials for conversion of heat to electricity; and (2) development of new materials for cryogenic cooling of Peltier devices for space-based applications. The Center for Revolutionary Materials for Solid State Energy Conversion, a US Department of Energy-funded research center led by MSU, focuses on solid state conversion of thermal energy to useful electrical power, both to increase the efciency of traditional industrial energy processes and to tap new unused sources of energy such as solar thermal. Additionally materials with enhanced thermoelectric properties will nd application in high efciency, environmentally benign climate control systems. We are undertaking a broad-based eff ort in semiconductor energy conversion materials utilizing and combining experimental, theoretical, and computational eff orts. A major focus of our eff ort will be in the synthesis of new forms of matter, including both single phase alloys and compounds and composite structures created using nanoscience. Ultimately, by working together in this Center we aim to develop design rules to predict properties of advanced thermoelectric materials, and realize these structures through innovative synthesis and advanced structural as well as chemical characterization. Some examples of current work in our group include the following:Understanding the relationship between structure and bonding and the thermal conductivity of solids. Good thermoelectric materials have very low thermal conductivity, and if we can understand how to control this parameter, new materials can be designed with improved properties. In collaboration with colleagues in our Center, we have combined state-of-the-art computational approaches with thermal and electronic transport characterization to study the relationship between crystal structure and proeprties of a class of promising semiconductors (fi gure 1). We nd that certain types of structural arrangements of atoms give rise to strongly anharmonic lattice vibrations, a key ingredient in determining a material's heat conduction characteristics. We have synthesized these predicted structures in the laboratory and veried the predictions of these computational models. Thermoelectric materials synthesized from earth-abundant sources. We have shown that the mineral tetrahedrite (fi gure 2) can be used directly as a thermoelectric material with very little compositional modication.

The major R&D and technology commercialization eff ort underway is building an industrial soybean based biorenery producing value added industrial products in Michigan in cooperation with Zeeland Farm Services (www.zfsinc.com). ZFS is Michigan's largest soybean processor servicing about 2,500 Michigan farmers and processing 26,000 bushels of soybean (1.56 million pounds) per day\u2014representing 99% of the soybeans grown in the state. Currently they produce two products namely soybean meal used as animal feed, and oil which is used in food applications. Diversifying the product base with higher value industrial products provides more economic stability and job creation to the Michigan economy. We developed an ozonolysis technology platform to convert the fatty acid methyl esters derived from soybean oil to C-9 diesters and C-9, C-7 monoesters which have industrial applications. The plant oils are being converted into biobased polyols which is used in making flexible polyurethanes for automotive and industrial applications. The soymeal residue remaining aft er removing the oil by solvent extraction is rich in proteins and carbohydrates. We are developing technology to make rigid polyurethane foams. Figure 2 shows samples: A is reference formulation with no soy polyol; B contains 25%, and C contains 50% of soy polyol. Another synthetic strategy being developed is to convert the figure 1. department of chemical engineering & materials science |41soy meal to polyurethane building blocks by eliminating or reducing the use of the toxic isocyanate reagent. Our biobased and biodegradable-compostable hybrid materials technology platform is based on poly(lactide) (PLA) resins derived from plant-biomass feedstock like corn and sugarcane. Funded by NSF SBIR Phase I and II grants, the technology is being commercialized by Natur-Tec, a business unit of Northern Technologies (NASDAQ:NTIC). The company currently supplies biodegradable-compostable bags to global companies such as Levi Strauss & Co. About 76,000 m.t./yr of plastic packaging resins are used for packaging 5 billion garments in South Asia alone (fi gure 3), translating to about $200 million in economic value. The group is working towards addressing the major issue of microplastics in the ocean environment. In a recent paper published in the journal Science (February 2015, 347:6223, 768), we reported that 4.8 to 12.7 million tons of plastics entered into the oceans in 2010 and without any intervention would increase to 10.4 to 27.7 million tons by 2025. The paper shows that reducing 85% of waste from the top 35 mismanaged waste countries would result in a 75% reduction of plastic waste going into the oceans. We are working towards developing and implementing compostable plastics technology in conjunction with composting and anaerobic digestion systems to prevent \"mismanaged plastic waste\" from entering into the oceans (fi gure 4).

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are a promising green energy technology off ering high chemical to electricity conversion efciencies, the ability to both store and produce energy, and a possible path to transition from today's hydrocarbon-based economy to a CO 2-neutral economy running on hydrogen, solar fuels, or biofuels. Unfortunately, traditional SOFCs have been restricted to operating temperatures in excess of 750\u00b0C. To better understand intrinsic SOFC material behavior and reduce SOFC operating temperatures, our group has focused on (a) mechano-chemical coupling in electro-chemically active solids, and (c) nano-composite SOFC electrode enhancement. Some of our recent accomplishments include the publication of most highly cited gadolinium doped ceria sintering aid paper of the last decade, the development of the world's most highly cited nano-composite SOFC electrode model (the SIMPLE model), and the development of a new in situ , electrode-free bilayer curvature relaxation technique for measuring oxygen surface exchange coefcients as a function of simultaneously measured stress state. Updates on our research can be found at https:/ /www.egr.msu.edu/nicholasgroup/simple.php. Mechano-chemical coupling. Materials capable of quickly exchanging oxygen with the surrounding atmosphere are used in a variety of electrochemical devices such as Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), catalytic converters, gas se nsors, solar thermochemical fuel generators, and gas separation membranes. In these applications, overall device performance is oft en limited by the rate of oxygen exchange with the atmosphere; a process quantied by the oxygen incorporation reaction chemical rate coefcient, k. Unfortunately, large disparities exist in the reported k's of even the most common oxygen exchange materials. For instance, literature reports indicate that there is a 2-orders-of-magnitude variation, a 3-orders-of-magnitude variation, and a 4-orders-of-magnitude variation in the 650\u00b0C k of CeO 2-x, lanth anum strontium cobalt iron oxide (La 0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-), and La 0.6Sr0.4FeO 3- (LSF64), respectively. Many authors have suggested that some of this k variation may be caused by varying MIEC stress/ strain states and/or electrode eff ects. However, electrode-free techniques capable of simultaneously measuring a material's k and stress state have been missing from the literature. To remedy this problem, our group has developed a new curvature relaxation technique to measure the oxygen surface exchange coefcients and stress states of dense, porous, thin, or thick lm oxygen exchange materials. This new, in situ /in operando technique is presently among the cheapest electrode-free techniques for measuring oxygen surface exchange coefcients, and is the only technique yielding simultaneous k and stress data. figure 1.

Traditional formation caused by wetting problems during manufacturing, the reduction of CuO during operation in hydrogen, and water vapor formation within the braze. The objective of this work is to design and test new, SOFC-compatible, silver-free brazes forming durable, oxygen and/or hydrogen impermeable protective surface scales. Computational eff orts to identify promising new braze compositions are being led by the research group of Dr. Yue Qi, while the Nicholas Group and the group of Dr. Thomas Bieler are leading experimental studies aimed at characterizing new braze SOFC produced by the inltration and subsequent ring of nitrate solutions have exhibited some of the best low-temperature performance ever reported. Unfortunately, it has been difcult to control the size of nanoparticles obtained via the inltration method. For instance, a survey of the recent literature indicates that 22 studies had inltrated particle sizes ranging from large 100-200 nm, 17 studies had inltrated particle sizes ranging from 50-80 nm, ve studies had inltrated particle sizes ranging from 30-40 nm, and ve studies had nano-particle sizes less than 30 nm in diameter. This inability to control inltrated nano-particle has restricted most nano-composite SOFC cathodes to operating temperatures >>600\u00b0C. Research our group has shown that nrecent publications Q.

We integrate rational catalyst design and synthesis, characterization and assessment, and modeling and simulation to understand structure-functional relationships. We work on two thrusts of signifi cant scientifi c and societal interest: biomimetic water oxidation to produce hydrogen and organic materials; and transformation of biorenewables to chemicals and high-density liquid fuels. Our eventual goal is to produce materials that are equivalent to those from petroleum- based raw materials. Biomimetic water oxidation to produce hydrogen fuel. The sun provides a clean and sustainable source of energy. However, its intermittency requires development of storage strategies to enable its use on demand. Solar-driven electrocatalytic water splitting, which converts solar energy into chemical energy for storage as fuel hydrogen, can eff ectively mitigate the intermittence of solar radiation. Water splitting consists of two half reactions: water oxidation and hydrogen evolution. Both reactions rely on highly eff ective electrocatalysts. Our work has focused on developing highly eff ective low-cost electrocatalysts for both reactions. We have developed an electrochemical method to immobilize a cobalt-based (Co-OXO) water oxidation catalyst on a conductive surface to promote recyclability and reusability without aff ecting functionality. We have also developed a method to synthesize manganese-based (MnO x) catalytic fi lms in situ , generating a nanoscale fi brous morphology that provides steady and excellent water oxidation performance. The new method involves two series of cyclic voltammetry (CV) over diff erent potential ranges, followed by calcination to increase crystallinity. This work has the potential to open routes for synthesizing and optimizing other manganese-based water oxidation catalysts (fi gure 1). We have investigated the feasibility of incorporating manganese-based water oxidation catalysts into TiO 2 to build a composite photoanode. Results show that the composite photoanode has good activity under ultraviolet (UV) illumination, and that its catalytic performance can be signifi cantly improved by enabling solar energy collection over a wider range of wavelengths. We have also developed a new electrodeposition method to synthesize Ni/Ni(OH) 2 catalysts in situ on conductive surfaces For the hydrogen evolution reaction. The new method involves two cycles of CV over a single potential range. This new inexpensive method involves a single CV scan of two potential ramps ranging from 0 to -1.2 V, and produces a catalytic fi lm with a uniform surface morphology consisting of an evenly-distributed monolayer of spherical walnut-shaped particles. The fi lm is stable, has a much better catalytic performance than traditional cc-Ni HER catalyst or Ni foil. A particularly important contribution of this work is that the new method creates a large number of Ni(OH) 2/Ni interfaces, leading to a catalytic performance that shift s signifi cantly towards that of platinum (fi gure 2). Catalytic transformation of biorenewables to high-density liquid fuels. Global energy will increase signifi cantly over the next few decades. Even with new sources made possible by figure 1. Functionality assessment aft er selected stages of electrodeposition. The gradual increase in peak current density during the fi rst CV series increases dramatically during the second CV series, likely the result of continued enhancement in the oxidation state of the catalyst. The slope of the functionality curve during the second session is strongly positive, giving indication of further enhancement in oxidation state.department of chemical engineering & materials science | 45 nrecent publications H.

This has created a critical need for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. Solar energy is an important source for meeting global demand, because of the quantity incident on the planet. However, even if technological challenges are addressed to make solar energy a mainstream source, it will be diffi cult to meet the demand for high energy density liquid fuels. This will, instead, fall on biomass conversion and subsequent exhaustive reduction. The goal of our research is to help address this critical need. We report here on an eff ective protocol for synthesizing octadecylamine (ODA) as stabilizer, for the aqueous phase hydrogenation of the -keto site of pyruvic acid (PyA). The facile phase-transfer protocol is a reliable method to obtain stable sub-10 nm Ru colloidal NPs. The ODA-stabilized Ru NPs in situ deposition on ordered mesoporous silica (MSU-F). We used three diff erent thermal procedures to activate the supported Ru nanocatalysts, each maintaining the uniform distribution of nanoparticles on the supports. Gentle thermal oxidation enables complete ODA decomposition, but does not remove the decomposed residuals. Thermal reduction allows complete decomposition and removal of ODA, but results in some loss of Ru nanoparticles. Argon-protected calcination is the most effi cient activation method, because it removes the ODA completely while modifying the surface structure of the support, and facilitating the metal-support interaction. figure 2.

Multiphase fluids (i.e., drilling fluids, foodstuff s, pharmaceuticals, blood, liquid crystalline polymers, aerosols, fuel sprays, oil/water dispersions, solid/liquid suspensions, liquid/gas mists, and bubbly liquids) occur ubiquitously in many applications in engineering, polymer science, human medicine, and biology. Computational methods can provide signicant insights related to the behavior of these fluids in extreme conditions and in complex geometries. Examples include hydrate formation in subsea pipelines; oil/water spills in the ocean; dust storms on Earth and on Mars; circulation of large scale ocean currents; mixing of pollutants in lakes and rivers; ice formation in the atmosphere; particle deposition in the lungs; and, effluent flows from hydrocyclone separators. Flows of multiphase fluids are oft en unstable and involve large-scale secondary motions that can signicantly influence multiphase mixing and separation, interfacial mass and heat transfer, and multiphase reactions. Professor Petty and his colleagues are interested in the further development and experimental validation of next generation multiphase transport phenomena closure models and the further development of computational transport phenomena methods for rapid analysis and design of processes with an emphasis on safety. Turbulent fluctuations and bird navigation . The solution of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equation is the only viable means for simulating high Reynolds number flows typically encountered in engineering practice and in the troposphere. Research at MSU for the past 20 years has developed a realizable, algebraic Reynolds stress closure for rotating and nonrotating turbulent flows. The theory predicts the redistribution of turbulent kinetic energy among the three components of the velocity in simple mean shear flows (fi gure 1). The new approach is being used to analyze atmospheric scintillation of electromagnetic waves induced by the local coupling between the angular velocity of Earth and fluctuations in the turbulent velocity eld. The relationship between scintillation phenomena and bird migration may provide an explanation of a longstanding question in biology: How do birds navigate over global scales? Cross flow ltration h ydrocyclone for liquid/liquid separation. A cross flow ltration hydrocyclone (CFFH) combines the desirable attributes of a vortex separator and a lter.

The CFFH concept may provide a practical means to mitigate three problems associated with current hydrocyclone clariers: (1) the loss of separation performance due to core flow reversal; (2) the loss of separation performance due to entrained particles in the sidewall boundary layer; and, (3) the loss of separation performance due to turndown. The third feature may be the most signicant inasmuch as the CFFH environment provides a self-regulating means to reduce the local ltrate flux across the sidewall lter. The CFFH concept for produced water can be extended to crude oil dehydration, to liquid/liquid separation of concentrated phases encountered in liquid/liquid extraction applications, and to downhole and subsea separation of oil and water. The objective of current research is to develop a prototype oil/water separator for eld testing. Multiphase flows. Particle-laden flows are widely encountered in the oil and gas industry. An accurate description of particle transport in turbulent flows is of great importance for predicting fouling of various equipment as well as erosion of pipe walls. As illustrated by the jet-pulsed mixer shown below (fi gure 2) and flow through a bend (fi gure 3), deposition of particles on the walls is influenced signicantly by streamlines curvature of the flow eld. figure 2 ( right, top ).

We are interested in materials that deliver clean energy. In the last several years, research grants from NSF, DOE, MSU, and GM allow the MSCE lab to study anode and cathode materials for lithium ion batteries, design brazing alloys for solid oxide fuel cells, and predict the role of oxides in aluminum casting. Utilizing the high performance computer center (HPCC) at MSU and both commercial and homemade soft ware, we are specialized at designing materials from their atomic structures. We screen materials chemistry with fi rst- principles methods, which solve the fundamental quantum mechanical equations of matter to calculate accurately the properties that are diffi cult to measure experimentally. We simulate materials behavior that involves millions of atoms using molecular dynamics with faster and accurate atomic interactions (force fi eld). The multi-scale simulation tools we use and develop include: Density Functional Theory (DFT), large-scale molecular dynamics, reactive force fi eld, parallel computing, phase fi eld model, Mesodyn, coarse graining schemes, COMSOL, and fi nite element method. We have successfully integrated nano-scale insights learned from atomic simulations into meso- and micro- structures, governed by continuum theories, to design materials that are important for energy effi cient and sustainable transportation industry. Central to these applications is a combination of \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" multi-scale modeling strategy with an associated experimental/ modeling research program. Therefore, most of our projects have strong collaboration with experimental groups and industry. Currently, the ongoing projects include: Electron and ion transport in complex materials and interphases. Defect-mediated diff usion greatly aff ects the power performance of battery and fuel cell devices. Using DFT informed thermodynamics formulation, we developed a systemic approach to predict ionic conductivity as a function of voltage, pressure, temperature in single and polycrystals. Recently, we extended our approach to include the more effi cient density functional tight binding (DFTB) method, so that the transport properties of nano-meter-thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) sandwiched at the electrode and electrolyte interface, a system with 1,000 atoms, can be predicted with quantum accuracy. Currently, these methods were used to understand and design high energy density cathode materials for Li-ion batteries; solid electrolytes coating with fast Li-ion transport, and cathode catalyst with large oxygen vacancies to reduce the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells. figure 1.

In order to computationally screen and design future battery materials for improved durability, we need to be able to predict failure starting from materials' properties and structures without using non-physical fi tting parameters. We have used DFT to predict the elastic and fracture properties of electrode materials and their interfaces, then integrated these properties into continuum model to predict the lithiation-induced stress and failure of composite electrodes. Many of our predictions have been confi rmed by in situ experiments. For example, while silicon is highly desired as a high-energy anode, it poses severe degradation problems due to its large 300% volume expansion upon full lithiation. Thin protective layers are a promising approach to mitigate the resulting fracture mechanics problems. Using continuous reactive molecular dynamics simulation of silicon nanowires and nanofi lms coated by either Al 2O3 or SiO 2, we have shown that fast delithiation leaves appreciable lithium inside the nanowire figure 2. Fast delithiation leads to trapped Li, lost capacity, and pore generation in Si anodes with protective coatings. Kim et al. Nano Letters (2017).and imposes a radial gradient in mechanical properties, while slow delithiation allows the nanowire to shrink and expel most of the lithium, but leaves defect structures that accelerate subsequent lithiation. These results provide guidelines for design and operation of silicon nanowire-based battery anodes. The impact of environment on forming and machining light-weight materials. The environment (air, water, solution, electrolyte) can have a profound impact on deformation processes for lightweight metals (Al, Mg, Ta, Li ...) that have a high affi nity to oxygen. Similar impacts of the environment are seen for electrode materials. By developing a reactive molecular dynamics method, we are able to track chemical reaction and mechanical deformation simultaneously and investigate their competing eff ect.figure 3.

Reaching this goal depends on the development of new diagnostic approaches that can acquire vast quantities of data simultaneously, improving our understanding of the behavior of diseased cells, and therapeutics that can be delivered specifi cally to the diseased cells and can target the molecular-scale causes of the disease with exceptional activity and specifi city. The Applied Biomolecular Engineering Laboratory (ABEL), led by S. Patrick Walton, is currently working in both these areas, specifi cally on technologies that rely on nucleic acids (i.e., DNA and RNA). Areas of investigation include: (1) designing nucleic acid-based therapeutics based on understanding their mechanism of action, and (2) applying genome editing to improve the understanding of cellular responses to stimuli. Recent work involves investigating how proteins interact with a new class of therapeutics, short, interfering RNAs, moving towards guidelines for designing these molecules. Additionally, the ABEL is applying CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to manipulate stem cell responses to diff erentiation signals. In collaboration with colleagues from the College of Education, Dr. Walton is examining how to apply the science of motivation to better understand engineering student success. It is his goal to expand the research on engineering student success beyond the typical metrics of persistence and GPA. Dr. Walton's research will examine student success by many metrics to help the broader engineering community better understand how to support students with diff erent short and long-term ambitions, ultimately enhancing the diversity of individuals and skills in the engineering workforce. figure 1.

To better accomplish this goal, these engineers pursue the ability to design novel functions rather than rely on a catalog of \"parts\" culled from nature. Proteins, one of the main categories of parts, are wondrously complex biomolecules comprised of thousands of atoms, which fold into tertiary structures necessary for function by balancing competing inter- and intra-molecular forces. Imparting novel and specic functions into proteins is a difcult problem because protein structures are only marginally stable, protein structure-function relationships are not well understood, and many targeted small molecule substrates diff er by as little as a single hydroxyl group or a methyl bond. The net result is that eff orts to engineer or design new/improved proteins are either empirical in nature or suff er from low success rates, frustrating eff orts to rationally and reliably redesign components for cellular life. My group works to solve the problem of engineering proteins. We use and develop computational techniques to design proteins for new functions, have pioneered experimental approaches to comprehensively assess the eff ect of a protein's sequence on its desired function, and have imparted evolutionary and computational ideas to formulate efcient routes to optimize protein function. We are now interested in developing proteins for diverse applications like vaccine design and creating the next generation of biofuels. Our laboratory is funded by several State and Federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy. Recent highlights from the lab include: Rapid conformational epitope mapping of antibodies. Antibodies that target specic antigenic epitopes on the surfaces of viral and bacterial pathogens can neutralize infection. Conformational epitopes, which exist when an antigenic protein is properly folded, are targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies for a variety of pathogens like influenza and HIV. While obtaining the structural basis of how antibodies bind specic pathogens is key for the design of structure-based prophylactics, therapeutics, and vaccines, current methods for conformational epitope determination are low-throughput and laborious. My group has developed a fast, robust, and inexpensive method to map the conformational epitopes of antigens targeted by antibodies. This crucial missing link is being used in labs worldwide to expedite rational structure-based design of treatment and prevention options for a range of human pathogens. nrecent publications T.A.

His group has been funded by the NSF and DOE to use microbubbles to enhance gas mass transfer. In a recent project funded by DOE's ARPA-E Electrofuels program, Dr. Worden's lab collaborated with the group of Dr. Anthony Sinskey at MIT to develop a bioprocess for continuous conversion of the gaseous reactants H 2, CO 2, and O 2 into the biofuel isobutanol (IBT). To address the three signicant bioreactor-design challenges: (1) extremely high demands for gas mass transfer; (2) safety issues resulting from the simultaneous use of by H 2 and O 2 gases, which form explosive mixtures; and (3) biocatalyst inhibition by the IBT, Dr. Worden's group developed a novel Bioreactor for Incompatible Gases (BIG). The BIG features a hollow ber module that allows the H 2 and O 2 gases to be kept on opposite sides of the membrane and transferred to the cells without forming unsafe gas mixtures. In addition, product inhibition is controlled by continuous removal of the IBT as it is formed. A prototype bench-scale BIG has been assembled in a walk-in hood, and an automatic process control system has allowed the bioreactor stably for up to 19 days. These experiments have demonstrated for the rst time continuous IBT production from H 2, CO 2, and O 2. Nanobiotechnology and biomimetic interfaces . This focus has recently been used to better understand cell toxicity caused by engineered nanomaterials (ENM). The approach uses an articial bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) to mimic a cell membrane. When ENM interact with a BLM, pores are formed in the BLM, and the resulting leakage of ions through the pores can be measured. Dr. Worden's group recently used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy provides a sensitive method to measure ENM's potency in disrupting biomembranes. One study showed that the method could discern diff erences in the potency of polystyrene nanoparticles (PNP) having diff erent in size surface charge. Negatively charged, carboxyl modied PNP 20 nm in diameter were more potent in disrupting BLM than those 100 nm PNP. However, positively charged amidine modied nanoparticles, PNP.

The project addresses the need for more high-performance, inexpensive biosensors able to detect toxic organophosphorus pesticides and nerve agents. The objectives are (1) to adapt the redox-cycling biosensor interface to nanoparticle-functionalized electrodes, (2) to develop a redox-cycling biosensor interface for alkaline-phosphatase-linked antibodies, and (3) to adapt biosensor interfaces to three commercial biosensor platforms. Conductive nanomaterials are being incorporated into the bioelectronic sensor interface and functionalized to measure activity of a organophosphate as an electric current. Additional bioelectronic sensors are also being developed that use a redox-recycling mechanism to amplify biosensor signals that measure binding of enzyme-linked antibodies to their target antigen. A portfolio of potentially commercializable prototype bioelectronic immunosensors is being developed in collaboration with an original equipment manufacturer.

Ultimately, we aim to apply this understanding to engineer improved functional materials for energy applications. Our recent eff orts have focused on crystal growth using optical fl oating zone, fl ux, and Bridgman methods, and on measurements of the high-temperature sound velocity and lattice expansion in materials used for thermoelectric energy conversion. Crystal growth of anisotropic materials. Our current aim is to develop improved thermoelectric materials for use in radioisotope thermoelectric generators designed and tested at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The thermoelectric materials used in this application must be semiconductors with very high melting temperatures, optimized electronic properties, and low thermal conductivity. They must also be mechanically robust over a large temperature gradient. Many candidate materials have atomic structures that are extremely anisotropic, and are therefore predicted to have more favorable electronic properties along specifi c crystal orientations, as illustrated in fi gure 1 for Ca 5Al2Sb6. This anisotropy is expected to lead to improved thermoelectric properties along the high conductivity direction. One of the most signifi cant barriers, however, to understanding the intrinsic electronic and thermal properties of complex semiconductors is the scarcity of large single crystal samples. This is particularly limiting in the case of anisotropic materials, for which measurements of bulk, single crystalline samples yield only \"averaged\" properties. In our laboratory, we are utilizing several high-temperature techniques to grow single crystals of semiconducting and ceramic materials from the melt. Our main focus is optical fl oating zone growth, illustrated in fi gure 2, which is a powerful method for materials with very high melting temperatures and relatively low vapor pressures. An optical fl oating zone furnace consists of several halogen lamps set in elliptical mirrors (four, in our case). The mirrors focus the light on the center of the chamber, where two polycrystalline rod-shaped samples are figure 1. (a) The predicted electronic properties of Ca 5Al2Sb6, a thermoelectric material with a complex quasi-1D crystal structure, are predicted to be highly anisotropic. (b) Ca 5Al2Sb6 single crystals grown from a molten metal fl ux will be used to experimentally validate the predicted anisotropy.department of chemical engineering & materials science | 57 nrecent E.

Light from four halogen bulbs is focused on the center of the sample, creating a fl oating molten zone.suspended inside of an inert gas-fi lled quartz tube. A stable \"fl oating\" molten zone is established where the two rods meet. During growth, both rods are moved downwards, so that the fl oating zone slowly progresses up the length of the feed rod. This method can also be adapted to materials with incongruent melting behavior by employing a molten fl ux (i.e., solvent material) instead of melting the target compound. Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. The thermal and elastic properties of materials are critical in a wide range of applications. Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is an elegant approach to characterize the elastic constants of bulk and single crystal samples by measuring the vibrational resonant frequencies. This method is also ideal for measuring the full elastic tensor of anisotropic single crystals, as the entire tensor is obtained in a single measurement. High-temperature RUS measurements coupled with high temperature x-ray diff raction\u2014also available in our laboratory\u2014gives us an figure 3. The resonant ultrasound method uses a piezoelectric transducer to emit acoustic waves over a range of frequencies. Certain fre quencies will resonate strongly in the sample, yielding a vibrational response that is detected by a second transducer. This method allows us to study the elastic tensor of single crystals and polycrystalline materials at room temperature and at high temperatures.extremely sensitive set of tools to investigate structural changes in materials, including gradual soft ening of bonds, order-disorder transitions, and structural phase changes.Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science Donald Morelli, Chair 428 S.
