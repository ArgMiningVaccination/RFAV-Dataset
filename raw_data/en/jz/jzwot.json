Temporary disability, with physician certification and Museum approval, may continue for a period of up to 26 weeks, including the portion of the disability funded through the use of accrued sick leave. When employees are absent for more than seven consecutive work days, the Museum, in compliance with federal and state regulations, requires medical documentation from the employees' medical providers du ly licensed to diagnose and treat the illness or disability. Employees should maintain contact with their supervisors regarding their expected date of return. Employees will continue to contribute and receive their health plan for the duration of the short-term disabili ty leave, or up to six months . Family and medical leave as defined by the FMLA runs concurrently with short-term disability leave. Additional information regarding annual leave is available through the Human Resource Department. Long Term Disability Insurance Salaried employees who work a minimum of 21 hours per week and have already used their six (6) months of short-term disability are eligible for the Museum's LTD benefits. Employees eligible for this leave will receive replacement income up to 60% of their normal salary (up to a maximum of $11,500/month). Typically, LTD runs for up to 24 months. However, if the person is permanently disabled and will not be able to return to work at the end of this term, they will qualify for LTD benefits up until they are eligible for Social Security Disability benefits. Should it appear around the fifth month of the six-month shor t-term disability leave that the employee will not be returning to work, Human Resources will forward the LTD package to him or her so that paperwork can be completed in advance, averting a lapse in coverage. Additional information regarding annual leave is available through the Human Resource Department.

Important Notice from the American Museum of Natural History About Your Prescription Drug Coverage and Medicare Please read this notice carefully and keep it where you can find it. This notice has information about your current prescription drug coverage with the American Museum of Natural History and about your options under Medicare's prescription drug coverage. This information can help you decide whether or not you want to join a Medicare drug plan. If you are considering joining, you should compare your current coverage, including which drugs are covered at what cost, with the coverage and costs of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area . Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug covera ge is at the end of this notice. There are two important things you need to know about your current coverage and Medicare's prescription drug coverage: 1. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available in 2006 to everyone with Medicare. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may al so offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium. 2. The American Museum of Natural History has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by the Aetna Choice POS II is, on average for all plan participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditab le Coverage. Because your existing coverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare drug plan. Additional information regarding this notice is available on the Museum intranet available on the Museum intranet, Human Resources Department page. Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 Under the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, group health plans must make certain benefits available to participants of health plans who have undergone a mastectomy.

Benefits for these items are similar to those provided under the plan for similar types of medical services and supplies.
