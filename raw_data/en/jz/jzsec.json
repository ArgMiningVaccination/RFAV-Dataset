If you are one of them, [this report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-complementary-alternative-medicine-market-164000257.html) might make you rethink your position. The global market for SCAM is expected to generate a revenue of US$ 210.81 billion by 2026. It is projected to expand by 17.07% from 2019 to 2026. Factors such as the increasing adoption and usage of natural supplements/wellness medicine coupled with government initiatives to promote SCAM are assumed to be the main causes ot this increase.

Just look at what some [German homeopathic firms](https://edzardernst.com/2019/05/a-german-manufacturer-of-homeopathic-remedies-is-taking-legal-action-against-critics/) were up to in the past. One could almost think that their ethics have been homeopathically diluted. The ['dirty methods' of little SCAM](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/homoeopathie-lobby-im-netz-schmutzige-methoden-der-sanften-medizin-1.1397617) can be at least as dirty as those of 'Big Pharma', in my experience. But [don't let's be beastly to the Germans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wveW9Tw2JKE)!! The SCAM industry in most other countries is much the same. And who could blame them? After all, they are fighting against a [Ku "}
