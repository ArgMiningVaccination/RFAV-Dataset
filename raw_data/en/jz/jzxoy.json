These chances can slowly progress into cervical cancer. As the protection against HPV is long lasting, early administration is required and it should be provided at the correct age. It is also suggested by experts for a timely cervical cancer screening for people who have a family history of the disease.

Adolescence is the best age to deliver HPV vaccine since it allows for a greater immune response. These vaccines are extremely safe and effective at reducing the risk of cervical cancer. When the vaccination is given before the age of 14, a six-month to one-year interval between doses is adequate. However, if the vaccine is administered beyond 14 years, three doses are necessary. The second dose should be given 1-2 months after the first dose, and the third dose should be given at least six months after the first dose when three doses are required.
