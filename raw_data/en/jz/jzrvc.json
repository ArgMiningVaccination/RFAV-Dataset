NIH R15: Genomic approach to find novel biomarkers and mechanisms of CFS/ME The employment of advanced genomic technologies and a well-rounded research approach will allow us to identify regulators of transcription that result in characteristic symptomatology associated with CFS/ME in female patients. DoD GWIRP/ IIREA:Testing the Model: A Phase I/II Randomized Double Control Trial of Therapeutics: Liposomal Glutathione and Curcumin The goal is to implement a phase I/II placebo control double blinded 3 arm study of liposomal glutathione, curcumin and placebo in GWI in 75 veterans with GWI (25 per arm) and assess the safety, feasibility and clinical response to the interventions;. Integrate repeat assessment and modeling of dynamic response to exercise challenge in order to map homeostatic pathways before and after 12 weeks of intervention. Finally, assess antioxidant and methylation-related metabolic status prior to, during, and after acute exercise in GWI subjects before and after these antioxidant interventions. "}
