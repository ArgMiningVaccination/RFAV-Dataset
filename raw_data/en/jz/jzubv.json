Most people who have received 1 bivalent shot are considered \"up to date.\" However, people 65 and older and those who are undergoing treatment for cancer have the option of getting another dose of the bivalent vaccine. [Mini Kamboj](/cancer-care/doctors/mini-kamboj), Chief Medical Epidemiologist at MSK, has answers to common questions about the shots. Who should get an updated (bivalent) vaccine? Everyone age 6 months and older should get at least 1 bivalent shot. It doesn't matter if you completed your original (monovalent) vaccine series or if you haven't received any COVID-19 shots yet. Children 6 years old and younger may need more than 1 shot. It depends on their age, the number of shots they've already received, and the brand of vaccine they got. Can I get more than 1 updated (bivalent) vaccine? These groups have the option of getting an additional bivalent shot: People 65 and older Timing: You can get another bivalent shot if at least 4 months have passed since your last vaccine dose. People who have a weakened immune system This includes people undergoing treatment for cancer. If you have received a transplant, CAR T therapy, or B-cell depleting therapy, you should discuss vaccination with your MSK provider. Timing: You can get another bivalent shot if at least 2 months have passed since your last vaccine dose. What does it mean that these shots are updated and bivalent? How are they different? The term \"bivalent\" means that they protect against 2 strains of COVID-19: the original strain and the Omicron subvariants BA.4/5. Since the COVID-19 virus continues to change, it is important that vaccines keep pace. The technology behind the COVID-19 vaccines allows for quick changes to the vaccine to match the strains of the virus that are circulating. Once we learn more about which virus strain is predicted to spread later in the year, the vaccine may be updated again. How effective is the updated (bivalent) vaccine? It's important to [stay up to date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) on your vaccinations. We know this provides strong protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. Although infection after getting a bivalent shot can happen, [data show](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7148e1.htm) significant protection from the bivalent vaccine in people who had previously received monovalent shots. Is the updated (bivalent) vaccine safe? How do we know? These vaccines work in the same way as the original COVID-19 vaccines and original booster shots, and they are made using the same process. Studies and real-life data on bivalent vaccines show that people experience the same side effects as the monovalent vaccines. More than 675 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been given in the U.S., including 4.25 million doses of the bivalent vaccine. For all COVID-19 vaccines, serious side effects are treatable and have been very rare. The FDA, the CDC, and the companies that make the vaccines have been rigorously monitoring safety data for all vaccines. That crucial work is continuing with the bivalent vaccine. If the updated (bivalent) vaccine provides better protection, can I get it as my primary shot? Yes. Unvaccinated people should get the bivalent vaccine as their very first shot. Can I still get the regular (monovalent) COVID-19 vaccine? No. FDA authorization for monovalent vaccines were removed in April 2023. All currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. are bivalent. I was infected with COVID-19 recently. Should I get the updated (bivalent) vaccine? When? People who have been infected with COVID-19 should still get the bivalent vaccine. We know from past research that vaccination after infection increases protection against future infection and severe disease. People who were recently infected may choose to wait 3 months to get their bivalent vaccine dose. Should I get the same brand of updated (bivalent) vaccine as my other shots? Or can I mix and match between brands? Either is OK. You can switch brands or stick with what you've received in the past. Can I get my updated (bivalent) shot at MSK? How do I schedule an appointment? Adult patients can schedule their 1st or optional 2nd bivalent shot at MSK [using this link \u00bb](https://appointments.mskcc.org/patient-covid-additional) For pediatric patients, you will need to call your child's primary care doctor at MSK.
