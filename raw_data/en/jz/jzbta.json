KEEP OUT OF CHILDREN'S REACH Why Herbal Extracts? Herbal extracts are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, giving faster results than capsules or herbal teas. Properly prepared herbal extracts give you the benefit of the herb in a convenient and easy to take form. They can be mixed with water or juice or added to a cup of hot tea to dillute the taste. Why Natural Hope Herbal Tinctures? Kosher Grain Alcohol, Food Grade Vegetable Glycerin, Water and/or Apple Cider Vinegar are utilized as the menstruum (liquid used to extract) with no industrial solvents. Each herb has its own unique process of extraction requiring different alcohol percentages and blends of menstruum. Average time of extraction is four weeks - some longer - to fully extract their best medicinal values. Herbal extracts are stored in airtight, stainless steel containers and stirred on a regular basis during the process. The finished product is bottled in amber glass bottles, not in plastic which may leach into the herbal extract. Common Concerns: Pregnancy - Very few herbs have been proven completely safe for babies in the womb. We do know herbs have powerful actions and may cross through the placenta to the baby, affect hormonal balance or stimulate early labor. It is best to not take many herbs during pregnancy, other than food herbs to support a healthy pregnancy, such as Nettle and Raspberry, unless they are absolutely needed and their use helps to avoid the use of more aggressive treatment. It is always wise to talk to your Doctor, midwife or other health care provider if you want to use herbs while pregnant. Nursing - Any herbs a nursing mother takes may pass through her breast-milk to the baby. Babies are much more sensitive to herbs than adults. Avoid the use of cleansing or anti-parasite herbs while nursing. Infants metabolize herbs differently than adults, with herbs often having a stronger action or a different action on babies and small children than on adults. Grain Alcohol and Celiac Disease - Natural Hope Herbals uses alcohol made from corn. Corn does not contain gluten or gliadin but a protein called zein. There is no protein left in pure Grain alcohol. Milky Oat Seed and Celiac Disease - Oats do contain gluten and tinctures and glycerin extracts made with fresh milky oat probably contain very small amounts of oat gluten. Studies show that most people with celiac disease can eat Oats without any mucosal damage (gut inflammation) or immune activation (not bothered by oat gluten). Natural Hope Herbals grows its own Milky Oat seed or purchases fresh Milky Oat seed from reputable herb farms reducing danger of cross contamination with wheat. Products with Milky Oat are unlikely to cause any problems for people with Celiac disease or other gluten intolerance. Pollen allergies - People with severe Ragweed allergies may react to Chamomile, Calendula, Echinacea, Feverfew, Blessed Thistle, Elecampane, Spilanthes or Yarrow as these herbs are related to Ragweed. An allergic reaction to these herbs is less likely with a tincture than a capsule or tea. Warning: Keep all extracts out of the reach of children. Children's products, and even adult tinctures, recommended doses contain very little alcohol but small children tend to take more than recommended doses if they get a hold of a bottle. Children do not process alcohol as well as adults and adverse reactions can occur at much smaller amounts. Even with low alcohol tinctures 4 oz. contains too much alcohol for a 2 year old to consume at one time. These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
