This is areport about the implementation of the first nine sales in that programme, thedegree of success achieved and the lessons that might be learned for futuresales. 2 The overall aim of the gold sale programme is to 'restructure the UK's reserve holdings to achieve a better balance in the portfolio by increasing theproportion held in currency'. The decision was taken against a background ofa decreasing market value of gold, which over the last twenty years has fallenfrom a high of $850 per ounce in January 1980 to an average annual price ofunder $300 per ounce since the start of 1998 1(see Figure 1 overleaf for average yearly prices). Since the announcement to sell gold, market prices havefluctuated widely from a low of $252 per ounce shortly after the first auctionon 6 July 1999 to a price spike of $325.50 in October 1999, following anagreement by European central banks to limit gold sales, and dropping back to$269.95 on 28 November 2000. The auctions were conducted in, andproceeds were received in, US$. Between July 1999 and November 2000 theTreasury had generated revenues of $1,990 million (\u00a31,357 million at the18 December 2000 US$1.467/\u00a3 exchange rate prevailing when this report wasfinalised) which has been re-invested in a spread of foreign currencyinvestments - US Dollars (40 per cent), Euros (40 per cent) and Yen(20 per cent). 3 This report does not question the merits of the decision to sell, which is a policy matter outside the remit of the National Audit Office. It addresses three keyquestions about the conduct of the gold sale programme: /G110Have the sales undertaken so far achieved good prices? /G110Has the Treasury met the Government's sale objective? /G110Are there any ways in which future sales might be improved?In this chapter Have the sales undertaken so 2 far achieved good prices? Has the Treasury met the Government's saleobjectives ? 5 Are there any ways in which future sales might beimproved ? 7 Conclusion 10THE SALE OF PART OF THE UK GOLD RESERVES executivesummary 1 Gold is conventionally traded in US Dollars per 'troy' ounce. Prices are shown in the money of the day. 9374vf.qxd 1/5/01 5:26 PM Page 1Have the sales undertaken so far achieved good prices? 4 In acting as an agent for the Treasury, the Bank of England has held nine auctions for a total of 225 tonnes of gold at two-month intervals, starting on6 July 1999 with the most recent one on 7 November 2000. Eligible biddersinclude the Members of the London Bullion Market Association*, (62 at thestart of the auction programme, 53 in November 2000) and also central banksand other international monetary institutions. We analysed the prices andproceeds achieved in relation to available benchmarks, in particular theLondon Gold Fix*. This is a well-established mechanism for selling gold, widelyrecognised in the UK and around the world as providing the best availablebenchmark for gold (Figure 2) . 2executive summaryAverage yearly gold price ($ per ounce) Source: National Audit Office1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999700 600500 400 300 200 100 0The price of gold has fallen over the last twenty years The average yearly price for gold over the last twenty years1 The London Gold Fix2 Buyers and sellers at the London Gold Fix relay their bids to the five Fix members and agree a 'clearing' price for all the bids. The London Gold Fix is a long-established system that enables buyers and sellers of gold around the world to trade twice daily with one another. The Fix takes place at 1030 and 1500 each day. It is run by five Fix members from different trading houses who, from a dedicated Fixing room in NM Rothschild, relay bids from their own organisation along with the numerous traders they represent (at a commission). Each session begins by the chairman suggesting an opening price, to which each member indicates if they are a seller or buyer at that price. The price is then moved up or down until quantities offered and required are matched. Gold is then traded at a common 'clearing' price. It was first established in 1919 and had earned an international reputation as a competitive market place for gold and recognised as offering a daily 'benchmark' for gold prices. BID BID OFFER OFFER Source: National Audit Office * See Glossary9374vf.qxd 1/5/01 5:26 PM Page 25 We compared the prices achieved against: i) The London Gold Fix price on the day of sale (for each auction). ii) The average London Gold Fix price from the date of the first auction (6 July 1999) to the date of the last auction on 7 November 2000 to provideadditional context to the comparison in (i) above. iii) The average London Gold Fix price over the period 10 May 1999 to 9 November 2000, as the Bank of England would have been able to start thesale programme in May 1999 if the Treasury had chosen to sell through theGold Fix. In this comparison average prices over an 18 month period are usedto take account of auctions taking place every two months. iv) The prices typically achieved in nine recent foreign central bank sales (themselves benchmarked against the London Gold Fix). 6 In this section we are using the Gold Fix as the best available price benchmark. As described in Figure 2, the Gold Fix price is set to balance the demand andsupply of gold sold through that mechanism - it is not set to balance the totaldemand and total supply of gold. If 225 tonnes of gold had been sold through theGold Fix instead of through auctions, and demand at the Gold Fix had beenunchanged, this extra supply, even if spread evenly over the period, would havebeen likely to lead to lower Gold Fix prices than were actually observed. It is ofcourse possible that all demand from the auctions would have appeared at theGold Fix and, in those circumstances the Gold Fix prices would have beenunchanged from those observed. This is by no means certain so the Gold Fix,although the best available benchmark, is not perfect. 7 The prices achieved at each of the nine auctions held to date as compared to the afternoon London Gold Fix on the same day are shown in Figure 3 . This comparison illustrates that the prices achieved were well in line with the pricebenchmark and therefore with prevailing market prices. The average auctionprice achieved was 21 cents (0.1 per cent) above the average of the London GoldFix prices on the days of the nine auctions (a variation would have to be someTHE SALE OF PART OF THE UK GOLD RESERVES 3executive summaryComparison of prices achieved at each of the auctions to the afternoon London Gold Fix price on the same day3 The prices achieved at each of the auctions have been in line with prevailing market prices $ per ounce 260270300 290 280 230250 240 6 July 199921 Sept 199929 199925 March 200023 July 200019 Sept 20007 Nov 2000 Auction Source: National Audit Office analysis of auction resultsAuction price PM fix9374vf.qxd 1/5/01 5:26 PM Page 31 per cent to be statistically significant2). Small variations between the price achieved in an auction and the Gold Fix price are to be expected as pricesroutinely fluctuate in the course of a day as markets open and close around theworld. 8 We also compared the prices achieved at the UK auctions to the average afternoon London Gold Fix price over the period from the date of the first auctionon 6 July 1999 to the most recent auction on 7 November 2000 to put the pricesachieved in a wider context. The average sale price of $275.01 achieved at thefirst nine auctions is 1.6 per cent less than the average afternoon Gold Fix priceover the period of $279.56. A variation of 4.2 per cent or above would be neededto suggest that the difference in prices had any statistical significance. Thedifference does not therefore raise concerns about the success of the UKprogramme of sales. Much of this difference reflects the volatility in the prices thatwas seen in October 1999 after the announcement of the European central banks ' agreement (see Figure 6 ). If the Gold Fix prices in October 1999 are excluded from the comparison, then the average fix price is $277.50, a price difference of0.9 per cent. 9 If the Treasury had decided to sell through the Gold Fix it would have been able to start the sale programme earlier than 6 July 1999. We therefore compared theaverage auction price achieved of $275.01 against the average price over the18 month period starting 10 May 1999 to 9 November 2000. An 18 month periodhas been used in this example to take into account the 9 auctions held every twomonths. The average Gold Fix price over the period was $278.08 - a pricedifference of 1.1 per cent. Again this variation is not statistically significant. If GoldFix prices in October 1999 are excluded then the average Gold Fix price is$276.18 - a price difference of 0.4 per cent. 10 With the assistance of the consultants to this study - Gold Fields Mineral Services, who are leading analysts in the gold market sector - our examination also drewon comparisons with recent gold reserve sales from the central banks of ninecountries: /G110Argentina (125 (813 tonnes; 1992 - February 2000) /G110Switzerland (160 tonnes; to end November 2000). 11 This analysis shows that in most cases foreign gold sales have, like the UK auctions, achieved prices in line with the London Gold Fix price benchmark. Thereserve sales undertaken by the central bank of Argentina were carried out fullythrough the use of options*, entered into when the price of gold was higher thanwhen the options were exercised. Sales by the Czech Republic were undertakenpartly through options. Although this resulted in significantly higher prices thanmarket prices at the time the sales were completed, the prices prevailing at thetime the options were entered into were up to $14 per ounce higher than theaverage price eventually achieved. If prices had risen instead of fallen over theperiod between the option agreements and exercise of the options then thecountries would have received poor prices compared to market prices at the timethe options were exercised. 4executive summary 2 See Appendix 2 * See Glossary9374vf.qxd 1/5/01 5:26 PM Page 4Has the Treasury met the Government's sale objectives ? 12 Underpinning the Government's aim to restructure the reserve holdings has been a more specific objective implemented by the Treasury: 13 The requirement to sell transparently has meant that the gold sales needed to be pre-announced to the gold market and that many of the details of theprogramme, for example the mechanism of sale, had to be made publiclyavailable. This contrasts with practice adopted in recent gold sales by otherforeign central banks. With the exception of sales by the United States and theInternational Monetary Fund* in the 1970s and more recent sales by the Dutchand Swiss National Banks, gold reserve sales by overseas central banks havebeen carried out in secret. The UK Government's decision to sell in atransparent manner reflects an emerging but growing commitment amongstleading central banks to provide more timely and open disclosure of reservefund movements. Moreover the Treasury believes that there is an a priori casethat revenue from sales will be increased through predictability andtransparency as a result of the reduction in the risk premium priced intobidders' valuations. 14 In terms of fairness , the Government's sale objective meant that gold market participants had to be given an equal opportunity to participate in the sales andinformation released afterwards had to be openly and fairly reported. Thisaspect of the policy objective effectively excluded using alternatives such asprivate sales. 15 On value for money , the Treasury needed to select an approach that would attract a good price and therefore a good return at each round of sales.Achieving a good price depends on a number of factors including the methodof sale, the timing of sales, the sentiment of the market and the technicalrunning of the programme. The Treasury's decision to sell through a series of bi-monthly auctions met the policy criteria very well 16 The Treasury's decision to sell through a series of bi-monthly auctions met the policy criteria very well and in overall terms should mean that all 415 tonnes willhave been sold in three years if the current pace of sales is maintained. Anauction approach is a very visible and transparent mechanism of sale. It isdemonstrably fair in that all members of the London Bullion Market Association,central banks and other international monetary institutions can participate freely.As illustrated by our analysis of the prices achieved in the nine auctions held todate, it provides for a competitive market place and delivers prices that are in linewith the industry benchmark. Of the main alternative methods of sale (shown inFigure 4 overleaf ), an auction approach, and specifically a 'Uniform Price Auction'*, scores highly on transparency, fairness and value for money. InUniform Price Auctions all successful bidders pay a single (Uniform) price ratherthan paying the price bid. Research commissioned for this examination hassuggested that Uniform Price Auctions may have a slight advantage over MultiplePrice Auctions* in that a greater number of potential bidders may be encouragedto participate (see Appendix 3).THE SALE OF PART OF THE UK GOLD RESERVES 5executive summaryThe objective for the gold sale programme is to sell around415 tonnes of gold in a transparent manner, over the mediumterm, fairly and with a view to obtaining value for money forthe taxpayer * See Glossary9374vf.qxd 1/5/01 5:26 PM Page 5The alternative that fits the objectives next best after an auction - the London Gold Fix - which could still be used for future sales, has only five directparticipants and offers slightly less transparency in that information on thevolume of sales is not made available. The Gold Fix is used indirectly by nearlyall members of the gold market internationally as a benchmark from which toprice purchases and sales. Some central banks have used the Gold Fix to selltheir holdings. Of the available methods of sale, an auction methodology scores highly against the sale objective 17 On the technical implementation of the sales, the Treasury's and the Bank of England's handling of the auctions has been very good. To build anunderstanding of how the gold market reacted to the auctions we distributed asurvey to all the members of the London Bullion Market Association askingabout the quality of the information provided to them and the technicalmanagement of the auctions. The results of this survey showed that the markethad been pleased with the implementation of the sales programme. Whenasked whether advance information on the Government's intentions weresufficiently clear 93 per cent of respondents agreed that they were well-informed ( Figure 5 opposite ). 6executive summaryTHE SALE OF PART OF THE UK GOLD RESERVES A comparison of different methods of sale in terms of transparency, value for money and fairness Treating all of the policy requirements with equal importance, auctions and the London Gold Fix are the most suitable methods of sale Method of sale Degree of Value for Money Fairness Transparency Auction High Medium/High Very London Gold Fix Medium Medium/High Medium/HighDerivatives Audit Office49374vf.qxd 1/5/01 5:27 PM Page 618 Similarly, over 90 per cent of respondents who had bid experienced no difficulties with the technical handling of the auctions. The messages emergingfrom the survey were supported by individual interviews held with key marketmembers and representatives of our expert panel. Are there any ways in which future sales might be improved ? 19 While this examination has demonstrated that the gold sales programme has been well run and that individual auctions have attracted competitive prices,the Treasury will continue to monitor, review and make revisions to theprogramme if necessary, in the light of experience. We recommend that theTreasury undertakes a mid point review of the programme now that 225 tonneshave been sold and takes the opportunity to consider four aspects of theprogramme.THE SALE OF PART OF THE UK GOLD RESERVES 7executive summary5 The vast majority of respondents were content with the clarity and detail of advance information on the Government's short term intentions.To what extent was advance information on the 'Government's intentions in the short term' made sufficiently clear and detailed? To a limited degree Source: National Page 78executive summaryTHE SALE OF PART OF THE UK GOLD RESERVES 20 The Treasury has been concerned to approach the gold market carefully and to take steps to provide clear and predictable arrangements for the timing andquantity of gold to be sold. Transparency and predictability in the sales processshould have a beneficial impact on proceeds. The market is now familiar withthe sales programme and the European central banks agreement (Figure 6 ) entered into in September 1999, provides a stable context for the sales. Weexplored with the Treasury and the Bank of England, therefore, whether theremight be benefits in retaining a small amount of flexibility in the volumes to besold and the timings of individual tranches. 21 The second UK auction took place on 21 September 1999, shortly before the European central banks ' announcement. Within two weeks of the auction the price of gold rose by 25 per cent. We explored with the Treasury whether itwould have been possible to postpone the auction until after theannouncement. In the Treasury's view to have postponed the planned auctionto take advantage of a possible but uncertain strengthening in the market wouldhave created very considerable uncertainty in the gold market with a potentialdetrimental effect both on the gold price, and on the market's confidence in thefairness of the auction programme, putting at risk the prospect of achieving thepolicy objectives of the programme. It was also not certain on 21 Septemberthat such an announcement would have been made. 22 Although there are various forms of flexibility that can be employed during an auction process, each entails retaining an option against bidders and should,therefore, impact on bid prices and result in lower revenues to the seller. Theevidence from our comparative analysis of international gold sales does notallow statistically valid conclusions to be made as to whether there may beprice benefits from selling on a more flexible basis although in the judgementof our consultant, Gold Fields Mineral Services, there may be such benefits.The Treasury does not think that it could outguess the market successfully northat it should or could trade on the basis of private information and so considers * See GlossaryThe European central banks' agreement of 26 September 1999 Details of the European central banks' agreement On 26 September 1999 11 Eurozone members, the European Central Bank, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK made the following statement: /G110Gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves /G110The above institutions will not enter the market as sellers, with the exception of already decided sales /G110The gold sales already decided will be achieved through a concerted programme of sales over the next five years. Total annual sales will not exceed 400 tonnes and total sales over thisperiod will not exceed 2,000 tonnes /G110The signatories to this agreement have agreed not to expand their gold leasings and their use of gold futures and options This was a major announcement that helped to steady concerns over the rising trend of central bank sales. While sales of 400 tonnes of gold per year represented an increase in the average level ofsales during the 1990s, the announcement helped to stabilise the gold prices. More widely theannouncement contributed to a growing recognition of a need for central banks to disclose publiclymovements on gold reserves. Source: National Audit Office69374vf.qxd 1/5/01 5:27 PM Page 8that greater flexibility could not be expected to lead to better revenues than the current market expectation. 23 Professor Binmore suggested that there could be benefits from the Treasury publishing a supply curve prior to each auction, varying the amount of goldavailable at each auction, and specifying the maximum that would be sold at aparticular price or above. The lower the price bid on the day the less goldwould be sold. He noted, however, that the market might criticise use of anuntested methodology. The Treasury are concerned that this could lead tostrategic game playing by dominant bidders and that, as bidders would have agood idea how much the Treasury wished to sell, there would be little incentivefor any bidder to bid above the corresponding reserve price. A potential benefitof this approach is that it would reduce the risk of demand in an auction notcovering supply. Further thought could be given to using the London Gold Fix 24 We examined the option of using the London Gold Fix as an alternative method of selling gold. The London Gold Fix has advantages and disadvantagescompared to an auction approach. It is less transparent in that total amounts soldare not disclosed but it offers the opportunity to vary the volume of gold sold andthe precise timing of sales on a daily basis. There is support in the London Goldmarket for using the Gold Fix. The majority of the market consider this method ofsale to be fair and agree that selling smaller amounts of gold more regularlywould be less disruptive to the market. As part of a review after the fourth auctionthe Bank of England recognised the strengths of the London Gold Fix but foundno compelling reasons to recommend a change. This is an alternative that theTreasury could consider again in consultation with the gold market. Considering whether there is scope to improve the quality of post-auction information 25 During the course of this investigation, our survey of London Bullion Market Association members showed that the large majority were happy with theamount of information available. Some of them were concerned, however, aboutthe quality of post-auction information, in particular the value of the 'bid cover'*ratio which shows the extent to which the volume bid exceeds the volume onoffer at each auction (for example 100 tonnes bid at a 25 tonnes auction wouldhave a bid cover of 4:1). It is difficult to interpret the information available on bidcover because the 'true' level of market demand can be manipulated through thesubmission of lower, less serious bids that can artificially inflate the bid cover.Our analysis of bidding patterns for this study has not revealed any evidence tosuggest that this has occurred. A number of survey respondents suggested thatdisclosing the volumes bid in particular price ranges, for example $5 ranges,would provide them with more useful information. 26 The Treasury and the Bank of England consider that the bid cover ratio is of some limited use but that in uniform price auctions, disclosure on biddingdistribution does not provide much useful information. This is because in thesame way as the cover ratio can be manipulated so too is there scope formanipulating other information published after an auction - such as on volumesbid in particular ranges. They agree, however, that it would be worthwhilediscussing the potential advantages and disadvantages of disclosing moreinformation with the market. THE SALE OF PART OF THE UK GOLD RESERVES 9executive summary9374vf.qxd 1/5/01 5:27 PM Page 9The Treasury should actively manage risks to the sales programme 27 To be able to judge the success of a sales programme and to anticipate the need for changes, a seller should put in place performance indicators and monitoractively changes to the exposure to risk on different elements of theprogramme. The evidence collected from this examination has pointed towardssuccess in the implementation of the gold reserve sales policy. Gold sellingprices at individual auctions have been in line with prevailing market prices;the needs of the market have been carefully handled and in most cases fullymet; the requirements of the policy objective to sell transparently, fairly andwith a view to achieving value for money have also been well served. As theprogramme continues, however, different risks are likely to affect theprogramme. For example, market analysts consider that volumes traded in themarket are now thinner than when the programme was initiated and that25 tonnes is now harder for the market to digest. The 'bid cover ratio' for theprogramme has varied from a high of 8:1 in September 1999 to a low of 1.3:1in July 2000. It would be good practice for the Treasury to keep reviewing'trigger' points for bid cover and price variations against the London Gold Fixwhich would initiate a review of the prospects for demand in the auction andprices respectively to consider whether existing arrangements remainsatisfactory or whether alternatives might be more suitable. Conclusion 28 In designing and implementing the sales programme so far the Treasury has met successfully its objective to sell in a transparent and fair manner whileachieving value for money. The prices achieved at each of the nine auctionshave been competitive and well in line with the prices achieved in similar goldsales by overseas central banks. The Treasury's agent, the Bank of England, hasworked hard to keep the gold market well informed and to secure a technicallysuccessful sales programme that has been applauded by almost all of the goldmarket participants interviewed and surveyed for this examination. As theprogramme progresses, the Treasury will continue to review developments. Inthis context the National Audit Office considers that the Treasury shouldinclude in its review the advantages and disadvantages of adapting the existingsales methodology, for example, by changes to the auction design or even tousing the London Gold Fix as an alternative or additional means of selling gold. 10executive summaryTHE SALE OF PART OF THE UK GOLD RESERVES9374vf.qxd 1/5/01 5:27 PM Page 10 "}
