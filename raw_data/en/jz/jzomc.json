If you ask for help, most people will tell you to visit your dentist so that they can have your wisdom teeth removed immediately. The idea may work for some; however, it isn't feasible for everyone, and something else may be required. Specifically, you may need remedies to get rid of tooth pain. This article will explore 20 amazing natural home remedies to help you find relief from wisdom tooth pain. 1. Warm Salt Water Rinse If you ask your dentist or any oral expert for a natural cure for wisdom toothaches, the very first words you'll hear are \"saltwater rinse.\" This is one of the most effective remedies for wisdom tooth pain relief and also the easiest one. Swishing warm salt water around your teeth and gums kills the bad mouth bacteria and promotes healthy gums. Sometimes, when wisdom teeth erupt, they can form cysts or damage the surrounding teeth. For that reason, keeping your mouth free of harmful bacteria is the best you can do for your teeth. 2. Cold and Heat Therapy Applying a cold compress on the painful area is the best way to minimize pain, swelling, and tenderness. Buy an ice pack from the drug store or make one yourself by wrapping ice in a towel or plastic bag. The cold pack will numb the area and stop the wisdom teeth from hurting. Alternatively, you can use a heating pad to find relief. The application of heat releases tension and increases blood flow, helping to recover from the trauma. Apply the hot or cold compress for 15 minutes, and then wait for the same amount of time before reapplying. When you are about to end the treatment, make sure cold therapy is the last part. 3. Peppermint Using peppermint is one of the best ways to relieve pain from a wisdom tooth. Peppermint is full of anesthetic ingredients that help alleviate the toothache and eradicate harmful bacteria from the mouth that cause infection. Moreover, peppermint will give your mouth a fresh aroma and taste. You can apply peppermint to your teeth in two ways. First, you can place fresh leaves on the area that hurts for 20 minutes and see the magic of the peppermint. Or, you can apply peppermint extract on the painful tooth using a cotton swab, leaving it on for a few minutes. Soon after, you will experience relief from your wisdom tooth pain. 4. Vanilla Extract To Treat Toothaches Vanilla extract is commonly used in cooking and baking. However, it has another great use - it can help you get relief from a wisdom toothache. The extract also contains eugenol, making it a potent remedy for tooth pain. To use this remedy, take a few drops of vanilla extract on a cotton ball or your fingertip and scrub it on the teeth that hurt and the gums around it. 5. Tea Bags Many times, the infected wisdom tooth can swell the gums around it and give you pain and discomfort. Luckily, tea bags can provide quick relief in these hard times. The tannic acid in tea has anti-inflammatory properties and makes up for an effective tooth pain remedy. To use a tea bag as pain treatment, refrigerate a brewed cup of tea and leave the tea bag inside. Once the tea bag is cold, place it on the gum that hurts. This will reduce the inflammation and bring relief to the pain. 6. Cucumber Slices If you want something refreshing to bring relief to your wisdom tooth pain, cucumber slices can be very helpful. Cut small slices of cucumbers and place them into the refrigerator. When your tooth gives you pain, put a slice directly over the hurting tooth. The coolness from the cucumber will ease the toothache and provide you with comfort. 7. Clove Oil Clove oil is one of the best remedies for tooth pain as it comes with a power of two. Eugenol in clove oil contains antibacterial and anesthetic properties that can soothe your painful tooth. Moreover, clove oil is antifungal and anti-inflammatory. Take some drops of clove oil on a cotton swab and rub it around the swollen gums. If the clove flavor is too strong for you, mix it with olive oil. Apply the oil multiple times throughout the day. 8. Guava Leaves If your infected wisdom tooth is giving you unbearable pain, guava leaves can be amazing in relieving the pain. These leaves have anti-spasm, antibacterial, and disinfecting properties. To end the pain, slowly chew the leaves and let the juice take away your suffering. Alternatively, boil three to five leaves for five minutes and use the cooled liquid to rinse your mouth. 9. Onion Finding onion on this extensive list of natural home remedies for tooth pain might be weird. But onions can be superb when finding a cure for a throbbing toothache. Some chemicals found in onions kill the germs that cause infection, allowing you to enjoy a pain-free mouth. One thing to note here is that pungent onions work better than sweet ones for providing relief. 10. Baking Soda Paste Baking soda paste is also a good home remedy to get rid of gum swelling and tooth pain. Take a bit of toothpaste, mix it with baking soda, and apply the mixture to the painful tooth. Within a few minutes, you'll notice the aching tooth is getting better. 11. Aloe Vera Aloe Vera gel is a safe treatment for the reduction of pain and inflammation around the wisdom tooth. It also speeds up the healing of gums that get cut when wisdom teeth erupt. Apply aloe vera at your mouth's back to find relief from tooth pain. 12. Tea Tree Oil When looking for something strong to kill oral bacteria, tea tree oil stands number one! It is important to note that tea tree oil is powerful, and you should refrain from applying it directly to your sore teeth. For a safe application, mix tea tree oil with coconut oil to minimize the concentration. After, apply it to your tender gums to get rid of the pain and bacteria lingering on the gum line. 13. Crushed Garlic and Ginger Crushed garlic can effectively kill the germs that cause tooth abscess. Making a paste of garlic and crushed ginger can be more beneficial for your condition. 14. Aspirin A very common way to get rid of wisdom tooth pain is by taking aspirin. It can easily dull the ache and discomfort you are experiencing in your mouth. Read the label carefully, and don't consume more than the recommended dose. Additionally, don't take aspirin for a prolonged period without a prescription from a dentist. 15. Menthol Menthol is a pain-relieving agent that gives a cool feeling when you touch it. To use menthol for alleviating a toothache, add some water to a mouth rinse that contains alcohol, menthol, and peppermint flavor. Now apply the diluted solution to the area that hurts. A few more ways for getting wisdom tooth pain relief 16. Turmeric Turmeric is great at providing relief from stomachaches. It has anti-inflammatory and numbing properties that can help in getting rid of tooth pain. One way of using turmeric is applying crushed pieces on the swollen gums, and the other is boiling the water with turmeric and then rinsing your mouth. 17. Wheatgrass Wheatgrass can play an important part in healing wounds and eliminating wisdom teeth pain. It contains a high amount of chlorophyll that minimizes the tenderness and removes the bacteria that cause infections. 18. Oregano Oil Oregano oil is helpful in killing bacteria and preventing oral infections. Moreover, it can ease pain and inflammation. Note that oregano oil is very powerful; therefore, always dilute it before using it. Mix a single drop of oregano oil with one teaspoon of coconut or almond oil. With a cotton swab or using your fingertip, rub the mixture on your gums or tooth twice a day. 19. Thyme Essential Oil Thyme is used in traditional medicine as a pain reliever and treats the fever that comes with a wisdom teeth eruption. A few drops of oil into a warm cup of water will make a nice mouthwash. On the other hand, you can mix thyme oil with a carrier oil and rub it on the gums. 20. Capsaicin Capsaicin is an ingredient found in cayenne pepper, and it helps in relieving pain and swelling. Specifically, it eliminates different types of body aches and sometimes numbs the nerve fibers. Capsaicin can irritate your gums, so to avoid any big trouble, apply only a small amount and see what happens. Pour one to two drops of capsaicin extract into a glass of water and rinse your mouth with the solution. Alternatively, you can apply it to the sore area using a cotton ball. Summing It Up It can take around two to three months for wisdom teeth to fully erupt. However, note that your third set of molars won't come together, so you can expect these painful symptoms to annoy you from time to time. If you're experiencing repeated headaches, throbbing pain in your teeth, blood in your saliva, or you feel like you have an abscess lingering under your gums, immediately see a [dentist near you](https://www.rodeodental.com/locations/). Not everyone is a candidate for a [wisdom tooth extraction](https://www.rodeodental.com/how-to-stop-bleeding-after-a-tooth-extraction/); however, according to the American Dental Association, all young adults should have their wisdom teeth checked by their dentist.
