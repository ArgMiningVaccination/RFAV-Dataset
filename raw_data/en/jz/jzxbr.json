METHODS: Sixty patients with chronic urticaria, treated withTCM andWM, were selected. Gray cor-relation analyses were adopted to determine thera-peutic efficacy. Association algorithms were uti-lized to ascertain the correlation between the dis-ease course and treatment results. A genetic algo-rithm was applied to discover the optimizationmodelintheTCMandWMtreatmentonCU. RESULTS: The total symptom scores after 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment in the TCM spleen-strengtheninggroupcorrelatedhighlywiththepre- treatment total symptom score. The duration oftreatment showed the greatest impact on the treatment had a better effect in the later stage, whereas WM was better in theearly stage. The duration of disease course had animpact on the effects of treatment. If the averagetotal symptom score before treatment was 83.0036, TCM or could achieve bet-terefficacy. INTRODUCTION Urticaria is commonly known as \"hives\". It is a type of localized edema reaction due to the expansion and in-creased permeability of small blood vessels in the skinand mucous membrane. Manifestations include rapidlydeveloped pale skin and wheals that appear in round oroval shapes. If skin lesions last for >6 weeks this scenar-io is defined as \"chronic etiology is complex is quite common, sopatients often suffer from rashes and itching, whichcan cause disruption to the activities of daily living.According to Chinese Medicine (CM), the treatmentsof urticaria include internal JTCM|www.journaltcm.com February15,2013 |volume33 |Issue1|treatment. In recent years, significant progress has been made in Western Medicine (WM) with respect to thepathogenesis of CU through research on autoantibod-ies that induce histamine release, as well as genetic andenvironmental factors. Based on \"data mining\" meth-ods, we undertook a study to investigate the clinical ef-ficacy of CM and WM for treating CU patients. MATERIALSANDMETHODS ExperimentalmethodsThe diagnosis of CU was based on the definition by Zhao in Clinical Dermatology. 2Sixty CU pa- tients Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) hospi-tal from October 2006 to December 2007 were select-ed. These 60 patients were divided equally into a TCMspleen-strengthening group (TCMSSG) and a WMgroup (WMG), who were the control group. Thisstudy approved by the appropriate ethics committeeswas performed in accordance with the ethical standardslaid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.In the TCMSSG, patients one dose twice a day, over thecourse of 8 weeks. In the WMG, patients were givencetirizine hydrochloride tablets (10 mg/tablet; Lunan Pharmaceutical Group, Beijing, China), 10 mg/d for 8weeks. According to the four grading standards men-tioned in the European MILOR study, 3we scored the subjective and objective symptoms of CU patients be-fore treatment as well as 2, 4 and 8 weeks after treat-ment. We then added all the scores together as the to-tal score, and evaluated the efficacy of treatment basedon the total score before and after treatment. Accord-ing to the total symptom score of each patient beforeand after treatment, the symptom score reduction index(SSRI)wascalculatedusingthefollowingformula. 4 SSRI=(pre-treatment total symptom score -total symptom score after treatment)/pre-treatment totalsymptom score.Four levels of efficacy evaluation according to the used: SSRI 0.9 was classified SSRI<0.2 was \"invalid\". The per-centage of recovered and cured patients reflected \"totalefficiency\".CU can be divided into allergic and non-allergic types, most of which is type-1 allergy mediated by immuno-globulin (Ig)E. IgE is a reagin, and its levels in the se-rum of healthy individuals are negligible, but are signif-icantly increased in those with urticaria. 5-10The total IgE count was recorded in CU patients before and af- ter treatment. IgE levels were detected using the ratenephelometry method and the detection reagents werepurchased from Dade Behring (Siemens AG, Berlin,Germany). Statisticalanalyses We used SPSS statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL,USA) as described previously. 11The paired t-test was used for the comparison before and after treatment inthe IgE group. Analysis of variance was used for thecomparison between the two groups after treatment.For further pairwise comparisons, Fisher's least signifi-cant difference test was used. Graycorrelationanalyses(GRA) The gray system theory proposes the concept of gray re-lational grade analyses on each subsystem, and is usedto investigate the numerical correlation between thevarious subsystems (or factors) in a certain way. There-fore, GRA provide a quantitative measure for the devel-opment of a system change trend, and are suitable fordynamic process analyses. It is a mathematical modelon the degree of correlation between the internal fac-tors of the research system. 12 The basic idea of GRA is to determine if the sequenceof curves are closely correlated. If the two curves arelinked closely, the degree of correlation between thecorresponding sequences is greater, and vice versa. 13 Thus, the degree of correlation is a metric of the over-all correlation on the sequences. This overall correla-tion is based on partial correlation, and has a decisiverole in the calculation of the degree of correlation.Moreover, a negative correlation is also reasonable andcan be shown by a change in the slope of the sequencecurves. A Gray similar degree of correlation calculationmodel is established. This model reflects the negativecorrelation and simultaneously meets the parallel andis consistent according to the slope differences betweenthe reference sequence and comparative sequence, 14as defined below. The sequence of the system characteristics and the rele- vant factors sequence were not equivalent sequences.The order is: as the sequence of the sys- tem characteristics. as the relevant factors se-quence. Correlation degree 61JTCM|www.journaltcm.com February15,2013 |volume33 |Issue1|YanMCet al./ClinicalStudy Gray relational coefficient In the present study, the changes in total symptom scores in CU patients upon treatment by Chinese andWestern Medicine were analyzed by GRA. AssociationalgorithmbetweenSSRIanddisease course The association knowledge reflects the interdependent or associated knowledge between an event and otherevents. The important feature of association rules is \"as-sociation is naturally combined\", which is useful tofind the existing mode of all the subsets. 15-17To under- stand the correlation between the efficacy of CM andWM treatment and the disease course of the CU pa-tients before treatment, the association rules were usedfor data mining, with SSRI as the input and the diseasecourse as the output. Geneticalgorithmsonoptimizationmodeling We used a polynomial fitting method to determine the symptoms of CU patients before treatment. We estab-lished an equation in which the independent variablewas the difference in value of total IgE (after the reduc-tion) before and after treatment, and the dependentvariable was the total symptom score of CU patients(after the reduction) before treatment. We used geneticalgorithms to explore the potential solution of theequation and analyze the effects of TCM and WMtreatments. RESULTS Graysimilardegreeofcorrelationanalysesinthe TCMSSGThe data relating to total symptom scores, numerical differences, and degree of correlation in the TCMSSGare shown in Table 1-3.The gray correlation coefficient was fol- 03=0.1463, and the cor- relation sequence 03>02>01was obtained. The total symptom scores after 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treat-ment in the TCMSSG correlated highly with thepre-treatment total symptom score. That is, after 4weeks of treatment, the efficacy was much better thanin the previous period. Graysimilardegreeofcorrelationanalysesinthe WMGThe data relating to total symptom sores, numerical differences, and degree of correlation in the TCMSSGare shown in Table 4-6.The gray correlation coefficient was calculated as fol-lows: 01=0.5958, 02=0.3905, relation sequence 01>02>03was obtained. The dura- tion of the treatment that showed the greatest impacton the total symptom scores was 2 weeks, next was 4weeks, and the last was 8 weeks. That is, the effects ofWM are complete after 2 weeks of treatment.

IgElevelsintheTCMSSGandWMGComparison of the total levels of IgE in serum before and after treatment in the two groups revealed the dif-ferences to be statistically significant (all P<0.01). After treatment, the total IgE levels in the TCMSSG weresignificantly lower than those in the WMG ( P=0.005) (Table 7).For the IgE group before and after treatment, a pairedt-test was used; for comparison between the twogroups after treatment, analysis of variance was em-ployed; for further pairwise comparisons, the leastsquares difference test was used. Normal referencerange: IgE <150 IU/mL. Relationequationandgeneticalgorithms We established a quartic da-ta of Table 8:y= -1.6403\u00d710 -6x4+0.00025576x3+0.0012819x2- 1.024x+79.5879.This relation equation is non-linear, and has no con-ventional method to obtain the exact solution. 18Search- ing for the optimal solution of the relation equation in-volves the application of an evolutionary algorithm,such as a genetic algorithm, immune algorithm andparticle swarm optimization. 19We used a genetic algo- rithm and selected 10 as the number of individuals inthe population, a binary encoding length of 20, a cross-over probability of 0.95, mutation probability of 0.08,and 10-6 as the accuracy. Calculated: y=83.0036. CU patients were treatedwith TCM or WM, if the average difference in totalIgE before and after treatment was 106.9518, the ap-proximate maximum value in the average value of thetotal symptom score before treatment was 83.0036. DISCUSSION Data mining can be incomplete, noisy, fuzzy or ran-dom data. Data mining is a decision support process.In the present study, it can be used to \"dig out\" poten-tial modes and predict the behavior of TCM and WMtreatment as well as to help physicians make the cor-rect judgment on the treatment effect (and thereby re-duce ineffective behaviors and processes and acquiregreater efficacy). Therefore, \"data-warehouse\" and da-ta-mining methods and their applications provide anevidence-based, decision-making technical basis to thetreatment of CU using TCM and WM. Data-miningmethods have been used in medicine to analyze the ef-fects of treatment, such as application of composite da-ta-mining methods to study acupuncture in juvenilemyopia. 15 According to the results of the Gray similar degree ofcorrelation analyses, if the patient did not recover after8 weeks of TCM treatment, extending therapy may beof some benefit. However, for WM treatment, if thesymptoms did not improve after 2 weeks, other treat-ments should be considered.The data-mining results of the two groups on associa-tion knowledge between the SSRI and disease coursesuggested that, the greater the SSRI (tends to 1), theshorter the disease course of CU patients. That is, theduration of the disease course has a certain impact onthe effect of treatment.A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimicsthe process of natural evolution. In the genetic algo-rithm, the optimal solution (or near-optimal solution)was searched in a feasible space via coding, selection,crossover, and mutation. After the analysis of the genet-ic algorithm, if the pre-treatment total symptom scorewas >83.0036, to get a better therapeutic effect, thephysician can choose other treatment methods, such as 0(k) -5 15 -10 20 ... 1(k) 20 0 -10 15... 2(k) 30 0 -15 10... 3(k) 15 -25 10 Notes: medicinal bathing or acupuncture. For CU patients with a total symptom score <83.0036, the TCM andWM treatments mentioned in here could achieve thedesired effects.In summary, 60 patients with CU treated by TCM andWM were selected. The Gray similar degree of correla-tion analyses, association algorithm and genetic algo-rithm in data mining were adopted to analyze the ef-fects of TCM and WM in CU patients. TCM treat-ment had a better effect at a later stage, whereas WMwas better in the early stage. The duration of the dis-ease course had an impact on the effect of treatment. Ifthe average total symptom score before treatment is 83.0036, TCM or WM treatment can achieve better ef-ficacy. Leboit PE, Robinson 2001: 613 -618. 3Dubertret L, Murrieta AM, Tonet J.
