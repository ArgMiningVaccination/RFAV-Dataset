Nutraceuticals are professional-grade nutritional supplements derived from natural sources. They offer a higher degree of safety and reliability than supplements sold in most stores. Healthy food and exercise are the foundation for good health. However, proper use of nutraceuticals can fill gaps in your diet or address nutritional imbalances associated with many illnesses. At Sutter's Institute for Health & Healing, nutraceuticals and dietary supplements are selected by board-certified doctors and licensed practitioners based on scientific merit. We buy nutraceuticals from companies that use quality ingredients and high manufacturing standards. Our products are carefully selected to ensure they contain active ingredients in doses that maximize their usefulness, while avoiding contaminants, allergens and additives. Our functional medicine and integrative nutrition services also offer diagnostic testing to help you identify the key nutrients you need to promote health and healing. This science-based approach will help you identify the best formulations, dosages and timing tailored to your unique medical history and biochemical needs. The institute offers nutraceuticals and dietary supplements at the following locations: San Francisco 2300 California Street [(415) 600-1311](tel:415-600-1311) Santa Rosa 1210 Sonoma Avenue "}
