Within the app, users can also mark their favorite herbs for quick recall and offline accessibility. Having access to this information will help you make informed decisions about supplement use. The HerbList app was developed by the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). The app is built around the NCCIH's webpage called [Herbs at a Glance](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm), which is a series of brief fact sheets that provide basic information about specific herbs or botanicals, common names, what the science says, potential side-effects and cautions, and resources for more information. The app can be launched through the National Library of Medicine's app pages on the [Apple App Store ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/herblist/id1382309745?mt=8) and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nccih.herbsataglance).
