Homeopathic remedies are derived from substances that come from plants, minerals, or animals, such as red onion, arnica (mountain herb), crushed whole bees, white arsenic, poison ivy, belladonna (deadly nightshade), and stinging nettle.

Homeopathy conforms with the universal laws of nature - humanity and existence. These laws cannot be changed. In this universal truth lies nature, spirituality, being-ness, harmony, creativity, honesty and freedom from disease. Every disease presents itself in its unique way. Signs and symptoms differ from each individual; even if the diagnoses might be the same. As long as each human respect each other individuality and act as an individual, the individual approach to illness will appeal to them more than conventional medicine. Signs and symptoms are a language of our body to address our inner imbalance. Homeopathic medicines are able to address a patient on the emotional, mental and physical level. Derived from natural sources, succussed and potentized - the medicines work on an energetic Niveau. As [Samuel Hahnemann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Hahnemann), the creator of Homeopathy, explained it, \"The physician's high and only mission is to \"restore the sick to health, to cure\" as it is called. The highest ideal of cure is rapid, gentle and permanent restoration of health, or removal and destruction of the disease in its whole extent, in the shortest, most reliable, and more harmless way\".
