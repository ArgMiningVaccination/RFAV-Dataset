The immune system, which is the body's defense mechanism, protects us from external agents like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and so on. If our immune system isn't healthy, a simple scratch can be fatal. This system is also impacted by our [emotions](https://themindfulword.org/2016/confront-emotions/) (anger, self-destruction, hate) and by our positive and negative thoughts, which may strengthen or weaken it. That's why it's vital to make sure that our immune system functions as well as possible by giving it the opportunity to effectively combat aggressors. A well-balanced lifestyle, healthy diet, exercise, and the use of stones and crystals will enable us to improve the body's immune responses and stay healthy.
