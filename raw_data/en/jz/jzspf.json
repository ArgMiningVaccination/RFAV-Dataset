Final Conclusions 33 References 34\u00a9 OECD 2021 3 Year after year, governments face the growing demand and encouragement from society and other interested parties to move towards more transparent practices and accountability for their plans and management activities. These demands, which for decades were focused on national governments, expand every day, and focus more intently on local governments (UCLG-CIB, 2016). There are many reasons for this. From meeting citizen's expectations and communicating management outcomes and decreasing the levels of corruption, to making public spending more efficient and responding to the need for coordination and cooperation with national governments for short, medium, and long-term objectives. Within Colombia, multiple national systems have been implemented to monitor development plans at the sub-national level. The city of Bogota, for example, supervises the execution of its development plans through standardized control forms and/or online platforms. Normally, this data is used to report on the compliance with public policy objectives established within development plans. Nevertheless, a proper the sub-national level does not have sufficient evaluation capacity. Few departments collect data to develop public policy and/or create future development plans. As a first step, they recognize the need to improve the indicators being used in their development plans (OECD, 2019). The OECD report on Public Governance (2019) indicates that, to do this, a cross-cutting coordination with the National Planning Department (DNP, by its Spanish acronym) and the National Statistics Administrative Department (DANE, by its Spanish acronym) is INTRODUCTION 4 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVELkey to complement Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) capabilities and foster the use of evidence at the sub-national level. This is what happens with relevant ministries, such as with the Ministry for Information and Communication Technologies adopting new processes that allow for sharing data more efficiently and speedily and/or with the Ministry of Finance providing help for processes connected to investments and operating budgets. In an effort to encourage a monitoring and evaluation culture at the sub-national level, the work conducted by the DNP to promote guidelines through online guidebooks in Portal Territorial is highlighted, as they provide technical support for territorial agencies to create, execute and monitor their development plans. Among those tools, we should note the Territorial Planning Kit where the DNP provides support for municipal and departmental governments to develop their Territorial Development Plans (PDT, by its Spanish acronym), and the Tracking Kit, comprised of manuals, forms and instructions to prepare, design and implement monitoring systems (See more in Box 1). Nevertheless, the OECD report on Public Governance (2019) recommends the DNP provide advice to departments and municipalities on the implementation of evaluation systems for Territorial Development Plans (PDT), such as on capacity building among public officials regarding monitoring and evaluation to anticipate future needs based on evidence (more information in sections 4 and 5). \u00a9 OECD 2021 5 Note: Respondents were asked to identify three aspects they find the most challenging to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis.

Portal territorial from Colombia: territorial planning and tracking kits Territorial Planning Kit The kit is made up of guidebooks, forms, and instructional videos to help draft Territorial Development Plans (PDT). It is organized into four (4) units: Unit 1- Strategic guidelines: taken from the proposals included in the Government Programme and providing material for defining the strategic guidelines that will direct the municipal or departmental work for the next 4 years. Unit 2 - Diagnosis: provides intervals in which to conduct a holistic analysis of the present state of the territory for each strategic guideline of the PDT. Unit 3 - Strategic plan: guides the organization of all interventions planned for the administration and the objectives for each of the policies, programmes, and projects of the territorial government. Unit 4 - Multiannual investment plan: presents information needed to plan strategies and financing plans for the programmes defined in the PDT. Tracking Kit The tracking kit is made up of four (4) units: Protocol, Enlisting conditions for tracking, Design of the tracking system and Implementation of the tracking system, which aim at increasing the understanding and scope of the monitoring system for development plans: Unit 0 - Protocol: it comprises general guidelines for using the tracking kit, such as the main institutional, instrumental, and conceptual elements to consider before preparing, designing, and implementing the tracking system. Unit 1 - Preparation of tracking conditions: defines guidelines for the data collection, analysis, and report processes. Unit 2 - Design of the tracking system: defines guidelines for establishing a tracking structure, system or model based on the institutional needs and reality of territorial agencies. Unit 3 - Implementation of the tracking system: it presents the methodology and operating conditions that must be guaranteed to implement the tracking system to produce relevant, timely information for decision makers. The tracking kit also relies on thematic guidelines, such as the Financial Kit which shows, among other things, planning and scheduling processes for the budget cycle focused on outcomes.6 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVEL1. What are monitoring and evaluation?Based on these conclusions and the efforts by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the OECD in the \"Fostering Institutional Efficiency and Public- Governance Effectiveness in Colombia as Strategic Enablers to Sustain Inclusive Growth and Bring Colombia to the OECD \" project, a series of workshops were proposed to discuss capacity building on Monitoring and Evaluation at the sub-national level. These workshops took place in 2019 (in person) and 2020 (virtual) with the participation of national agencies and public officials from the sub-national level. From these workshops, as well as from the actions proposed in the project from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, this document aims at providing a practical guide to help public officials working in the Planning Secretariats at the sub-national level build Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems. To do this, we must connect the concepts that make up an M&E system to their challenges, solutions and examples of good practices that might drive sub-national governments.Monitoring and evaluation are two different concepts and instruments, each valuable in their own right. On the one hand, monitoring or tracking is the continuous process involving the collection and analysis of data on indicators to measure the progress of a project, programme, or policy regarding specific objectives (OECD, 2019; Linda G & Ray C, 2009). Conversely, the evaluation of public policies is an objective, thorough analysis of \"future, present and completed public policy initiatives\" (OECD, 2019) that seeks to explain whether the programme evaluated has contributed to or had an impact on the objectives pursued (See Table 1). \u00a9 OECD 2021 7 According to the tracking kit (Unit 0), tracking or monitoring is a \"public management tool aimed at outlining progress in and challenges for the implementation of policies concerning the objectives proposed by governments\". It is covered within the Outcome-Oriented Public Management (OPM1). Additionally, it is agreed that tracking or monitoring is a continuous, systematic process of data collection and analysis. The Portal Territorial does not yet stipulate a definition for \"evaluation\". Nevertheless, the DNP has a Methodological Guide for Monitoring and Assessing Public Policies2 in which 1 Unit 0: Tracking kit protocol: https://colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Desarrollo%20Territorial/Portal%20 Territorial/KitSeguimiento/unidad%200/U nidad0.pdf 2 colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Sinergia/Documentos/Cartilla%20Guia%20 para%20Seguimiento%20y%20Eval uaci%C3%B3n%20Ago%2013.pdf\"evaluation\" is understood as: \"systematic, objective research applied to some of the different links in the value chain (supplies, processes, products, and results), whose aim is to improve the design, implementation, execution and effects of a policy, plan, programme, or project, through decision-making\". Likewise, this guide suggests characteristics that respond to the needs of the National Government, but which might be reflected in the guidelines sub- national governments ought to follow, such as the development of evaluations focused on decision-making, which may follow a standardized process, provide continuous assistance, and entail the participation of all stakeholders involved (DNP, 2014) (More information in Section 5).Table 1. Comparing of public policy monitoring and evaluation Monitoring of public policies Evaluation of public policies Continuous (leading to operative decision-making) Episodic (leading to strategic decision-making) Monitoring systems are often appropriate for general issues or questions anticipated when designing the policySpecific to the problem Measures are usually developed, and data is collected through routine proceduresMeasures are often made specifically for each policy evaluation The attribution is generally presupposed The attribution of results observed is often a key issue Since it is continuous, resources are often part of the programme or organizational infrastructureTargeted resources are needed for each policy evaluation Data use might evolve in time to reflect the changing needs and information prioritiesUsually, aims provided for in a policy evaluations are negotiated in advance Source: Open Government in Biscay (Open Government in Biscay , 2019)8 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVELTraditionally, monitoring and evaluation focused on tracking elements associated with the isolated implementation of one or more programmes (supplies, activities and/or products) (IDB, 2014). However, monitoring and evaluation under a logic based on outcomes may shape up to become a \"system\" so that the benefit might be bigger than the sum of their parts. An M&E System periodically and systematically collects data on the stakeholders who take part in the public value creation process (IDB, 2014) to contribute to social, economic, and political change in multiple dimensions. An M&E system might contribute, among other things, to accomplishing the government's objectives by: Understanding and improving the execution of projects, programmes, and public policies at the political, technical, and administrative level (i.e., improving spending quality). Proving the scope and contribution of projects, programmes, and public policies to the government's objectives. Learning lessons on the execution, success or failure of projects, programmes, and public policies to make decisions based on evidence. In other words, improving the quality of decisions. Increasing the participation of citizens and accountability for the prioritisation of resource allocation, and on the progress and outcomes of projects, programmes, and public policies. Facilitating the interaction and dialogue within territorial agencies. Nevertheless, starting up and maintaining a Monitoring and Evaluation System can be understood as a complex, expensive process, whose benefits are capitalized in the long term. This perception is usually based on a partial understanding of processes, uses and rewards created by the system along the life cycle of public policies. Building an M&E system requires, among other things, proper institutionalization, political leadership, specialized human resources, and governmental coordination to ensure the quality and use of outcomes and foster the improvement of public policies (OECD, 2021). Regardless of the guidelines for building an M&E system, there is no one unique monitoring and evaluation model that fits all sub-national governments (UCLG-CIB, 2016), but rather each government can create such a model based on its institutional context, financial possibilities, and specific purposes. Within the framework of Colombian regulations, a monitoring and evaluation system from sub- national governments is expected to share in a timely manner the progress on and outcomes of projects, programmes, and public policies included in a Territorial Development Plan executed using resources from the public budget. For this, building an M&E system at the sub-national level requires, as an initial step, adapting to the existing institutional context. For the M&E to be effective in the Colombian context, it should ideally be inserted within the framework of the Territorial Development Plans (PDT) and Land Use Plans (POT, for its Spanish acronym). However, creating a monitoring and evaluation culture also means that M&E should be a useful tool for learning and improving the daily decision-making in public administrations.2. Why are they relevant?\u00a9 OECD 2021 9 In an ideal context, the life cycle of a public policy starts when planning its medium and long-term strategic objectives and, once they have been executed, it ends with their partial or total completion and evaluation. Creating an M&E system requires strategic planning, with clear objectives and indicators that may answer questions such as: which outcomes are we pursuing? How will public resources be used? Which activities/interventions shall be conducted? Which supplies are needed? Thus, while strategic planning works as a roadmap for government policies and programmes, the M&E system can be understood as a navigation system providing information along the way and about the destination. Even if the details on strategic planning for a sub-national government are not within the objectives of this document, it should be noted that developing an M&E system is connected to strategic planning. In the Colombian case, it is expected for monitoring and evaluation to be organized around Territorial Development Plans (PDT) and Land Use Plans (POT) at first in order to provide information on the progress, results and impact obtained, assist on the early detection of inconsistencies between outcomes and mediums (processes, activities, interventions) and provide information on accountability when outcomes are shared with citizens, stakeholders and other parts of the establishment (OECD, 2019). 3.1. Strategic planning: Long term, medium term, or both? Sub-national governments can conduct their 3. The importance of planning and design for monitoring and evaluationstrategic planning with different time horizons. International practices show a combination of two non-mutually exclusive schemes. Long term planning. On the one hand, there are long term experiences that exceed the term of an administration (elected government), cover a horizon of at least 10 years (M\u00e1ttar & Cuervo, 2017), and determine strategic axes, multisectoral and sectorial objectives and, eventually, a kit of indicators for their monitoring. In the Colombian case, the legal framework in force3 established the creation of 12-year Land Use Plans, which direct the physical and geographic development of territorial agencies. The Plans define strategies for how a city or department may make use of the soil and its impact in the community. Nevertheless, the PTO only covers one of the possible strategic axes of a sub- national government, such as infrastructure. Since strategic planning leads to the development, application, tracking and evaluation of a strategic, long-term vision for a territorial agency in Colombia, it is vital to overcome disparities in fiscal, institutional and management capabilities at the sub-national level, and to promote the participation and vision of citizens, social organizations, and political institutions to ensure their legitimacy and sustainability over time (OECD, 2019). A strategic plan must reflect the vision of the territorial agency and its characteristics, and not those of a specific government. Some examples of this are the experiences of the Autonomous 3 1.

In each case, the starting point was to look for a multidimensional future vision shared by citizens and social stakeholders, coordinated by the Executive Branch in office, but with the participation of the entire political spectrum. Additionally, experiences show that the result is an extensive, flexible plan that Box 2. Strategic long-term planning in action: Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2017, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentina (CABA, by its Spanish acronym) presented its \"Buenos Aires 2035 Strategic Participatory Plan\". The long-term strategic plan was developed over 8 months and centreed around citizen participation through the representation of 183 social, civil, cultural, religious, educational, and political organizations, and the involvement of the highest authorities in government, along with the ministers and authorities of the Legislative Branch. The outcomes of the work go beyond the term of the government and, as such, the need to be flexible and open was considered. The consultative process led to a vision called \"Prospective Vision of the City we Want\", from which five strategic guidelines for 2035 arose. Given its cross-cutting expansion into different areas of government, each strategic guideline is combined with sectoral government plans. On these bases, proposals for action are connected to 432 objectives with 510 indicators, mostly on outcomes and products. The government in office must set up its government programme to be monitored and assessed based on this Plan. Given the ample participation and discussion, the strategic guidelines from the Plan should reflect the priorities of the citizens. At the same time, it should facilitate planning for public policies, programmes, and actions which, under proper monitoring and evaluations, would improve accountability, decrease deviations, and improve the quality of life of citizens. Source: https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/noticias/plan-estrategico-participativo-buenos-aires-2035-pep-ba-2035 serves as a guide for creating concrete policies and projects. Medium Term Planning. Conversely, sub-national governments develop medium-term strategic plans that are synchronized or happen within their term in office (M\u00e1ttar & Cuervo, 2017). In those cases, objectives are generally connected to specific policies, programmes, and projects of a \u00a9 OECD 2021 11 government plan and, in many Latin American countries there is a specific legal framework regulating and guiding planning. Such is the case for the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. Its Strategic Planning Act sets the guidelines and authorities in charge of creating a long-term Strategic Plan and a medium-term State Development Plan. In the Colombian case, the 1991 Constitution (Art. 339) and the laws based on it provide for the creation of Territorial Development Plans every 4 years (OECD, 2019). They must articulate with the National Development Plan which is circumscribed to a president's term in office. Best practices for planning often call for the existence of an entity charged with boosting, coordinating, and providing technical assistance to areas responsible for developing policies, plans and projects as well as their indicators and objectives (Aquilino, Ballesc\u00e1, & Rubio, 2017), such as the DNP. The involvement of citizens and stakeholders in medium-term planning helps sub-national governments define, organize, and confirm priorities, align expectations, and have a more constructive monitoring and accountability. Despite these strengths, it should be noted that participatory planning does not solve issues on its own and is not without limitations, as is the case for changing priorities or external factors unforeseen when planning. Finally, when long and medium-term planning coexist, international experiences show that sub- national governments use the former as a guide from which to design and execute concrete policies and projects that may have a long-term impact on the social context, while governments move forward with the commitments made to society (Aquilino, Ballesc\u00e1, & Rubio, 2017). 3.2. Monitoring and evaluation system design: what to monitor, what to evaluate and how to do it? Sub-national governments have multiple methods or tools at their disposal that help design and understand if and how their initiatives help them to achieve their objectives. According to a study conducted with governments and local entities (UCLG-CIB, 2016), despite using new Key questions Does the government have a long-term plan, either its own or from the national government, that reflects the local vision and context through clear objectives? Does it have a medium-term plan connecting its long-term objectives to policies and projects to be executed during that government's administration? Was planning designed based on a Change Theory, a Logical Framework or on another methodology, which enable actors to set a course and outline assumptions, from the allocation of physical and financial resources to the expected social benefits? Have citizens and stakeholders actively participated? Are their opinions included in long and medium-term plans?12 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVELBox 3. Training activities for programme design in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the Jalisco state. To expand the M&E culture throughout the government, the government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aire holds training workshops on the design of policies and projects under the Change Theory and, at the same time, provides a series of practical guidebooks (with questions and matrices) to all government units for them to prioritize and draft their projects. Meanwhile, the government of Jalisco has a full guide on how to design programmes under the so-called Operation Rules available to all areas of government. The document guides the planning needed to connect budget allocation to monitoring and evaluation in those programmes affecting a specific part of the population or that are subsidized. Source: Entrevistas; https://seplan.app.jalisco.gob.mx/mide/panelCiudadano/iniciotools such as Outcome Mapping4 or the Most Significant Change (MSC)5 methodology, the Logical Framework and Change Theory remain widely used and are especially useful when governments are including monitoring and evaluation expectations in the early stages of planning. Each departmental and/or local entity shall decide on the approach used to connect its policies to the outcomes pursued, and its technical capabilities to its human resources. Nevertheless, the government should know which methods it will use and professionals in charge of monitoring and evaluation should work towards spreading the practice across the organization. Examples of good practices are 4 Outcome Mapping studies the social changes and transformations brought about by projects, programmes, and policies, focusing on out - comes (understood as behavioral changes) rather than on impact. In that sense, the methodology puts people (stakeholders) and learning at the forefront. 5 The Most Significant Change (MSC) seeks to explain \"how\" and \"under which contexts and circumstances\" changes can and do take place. This tool is generally used in actions where expected effects cannot be predetermined. The MSC applies a qualitative and participatory method- ology where stakeholders and governments jointly design, monitor and evaluate actions. the Jalisco state, and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, where its Planning Unit fosters the use of Change Theory by coordinating and training the executive units in charge of designing and executing the projects and programmes (Box 3). Once government planning is on the table, the first question asked is: what should be monitored and evaluated? Departmental and/or municipal governments can answer this considering at least 3 axes. 1. What should be prioritized when monitoring and evaluating? Sub-national governments have multiple programmes and public policies, and they are not necessarily part of the government's strategic planning and its monitoring and \u00a9 OECD 2021 13 evaluation. A considerable amount of minimum goods and services are provided to citizens by the government by default and, although they should not be disregarded or minimized when considering their efficient execution, they can be tackled outside of the M&E system. Recognizing this means understanding that not all government actions are strategic or contribute equally to medium and long-term objectives. An example could be acquiring commonly used goods or even executing minor maintenance work. Additionally, it is likely that local and/or departmental governments may not to have sufficient funds, human resources, or institutional capabilities to monitor all their government programmes. By prioritizing certain programmes to be monitored or evaluated, sub-national governments must ask whether they truly relate to their government objectives. This implies the participation, on the one hand of the highest authorities (mayors or governors and secretaries) in charge of deciding the government's objectives and policies. According to the OECD report on Public Governance (2019), \"the growing decentralization and increasing level of responsibility of sub-national governments in many countries has brought to light the importance of sub-national government centres\". Based on this, the OECD drafted an initial definition at the departmental level indicating that a Departmental Government Centre is \"the set of units that assist the Governor in creating, implementing, tracking and evaluating his or her public policy agenda\" (see more in Box 4). This report also mentions the main functions of the Government Centre in the Departmental Development Plan, among which we highlight: coordinating and aligning the plan with other planning frameworks of the department, vertically coordinating with municipalities, and tracking and evaluating the execution of plans (OECD, 2019). On the other hand, it is essential for citizens and stakeholders to participate in this process. If policy prioritization (and monitoring) does not align with local demands, the efforts of government authorities will hardly contribute to citizen's trusting them and evaluating them favorably. In the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, each Secretariat submits the projects it deems a priority based on their connection with and contribution to the government's strategic axes and commitments. The Planning Unit, which is also in charge of monitoring and evaluation, validates this prioritisation. 14 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVELBox 4. Departmental government centres in Colombia According to the OECD report on public governance (2019), the Departmental Government Centre is generally made up of a set of secretariats or units among which we find the General Secretariat's Office, the Planning Secretariat, the Finance Secretariat and (in the event it exists) the Secretariat in charge of economic and social development. These entities jointly act as a leadership and coordination centre for the departmental government. They work in close collaboration to: Directly support the head of the departmental government (Governor, in the Colombian case) and manage the agenda for the Government Council. Lead the development, implementation, tracking and evaluation of regional strategies and public policy initiatives (including the Departmental Development Plan). Coordinate regional strategies and public policy initiatives with other secretariats and decentralized agencies of the departmental government. Coordinate government strategies and public policy initiatives with local and municipal authorities and provide technical assistance to municipalities. Coordinate the harmonized implementation of regulations and administrative rules related to the operation of the public administration (modifications to public governance, human resources management, public procurement, integrity, transparency, etc.) across the government. Lead the debate on public policy strategies and coordinate strategies and public policy initiatives with the national government ((including the Departmental Development Plan). Manage the budget and allocate funds.

Do the projects monitored have a medium and long-term horizon? When deciding which projects to monitor and evaluate: were available technical capabilities considered?\u00a9 OECD 2021 15 2. Which milestones within the public value chain should be monitored and evaluated? Knowing if programmes are being executed based on what was planned, and whether they lead to the outcomes sought requires the establishment of milestones or stages that indicate progress in the right direction or lack thereof. When designing the M&E system, it is vital to analyze risks and likely bottlenecks in the value chain of each project, programme and/ or public policy. Conversely, it is unlikely that public actions will achieve expected outcomes due to problems in their execution. Delivering on goods and services planned for implies dealing with each link in the value chain (also known as change theory) in a timely, correct manner (see Figure 1). No stage is without risks and departmental and/ or municipal governments must analyze them case by case, based on the characteristics of each programme and on their own capabilities. The literature summarizes the value chain as the sequence detailed below. For each programme to be monitored, local and/ or departmental governments must plan which key milestones will be monitored within each link in the value chain. Selecting each milestone no longer involves the highest political authority, and it is common for Planning Secretariats to make decisions, as it requires knowledge on the processes and management time involved. As a rule, it is recommended to monitor at least one milestone in each link of the value chain, for this ensures, at the least, that there is one person in charge and one goal associated to the progress in the execution of the project or policy.

Does the information included in the value chain have a goal and responsible person assigned to it? How reasonable is the measurement of milestones in each stage of the value chain?16 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVEL4. Scheduling and operational execution of monitoring Once the results of strategic planning are on the table, governments are ready to focus on the scheduling and operational execution of a monitoring system. There is no single solution for this to fit all cases, but rather each sub- national government must execute a solution based on its needs and possibilities. However, there are theoretical and practical principles that serve as a guide for building a monitoring system from its operational aspect. 4.1. What type of indicators are there? A complete system of indicators must answer to a logical hierarchy. As mentioned earlier, developing a chain of value allows actors to understand how an action, programme, or public policy must lead to a particular change and have an impact. Under this causal outline, indicators shall be connected to outcomes and reference points, which make each goal measurable and projected in time. Considering this, the following indicators are outlined: Input/supplies indicators6 measure resources and means (productive factors: physical, human, legal, financial and goods and/or services) used to create value in the productive process and thus carry out the public action (DNP, 2018). Process/activity indicators7 are focused on actions implemented to transform supplies into products (DNP, 2018). Product indicators measure the goods and 6, 7 According to the Guide for Creating Indicators (2018), input and activity indicators are subcategories of management indicators. services (physical, tangible, and cumulative) created and delivered (DNP, 2018). Intermediate outcome indicators measure the intermediate products of an action (changes in institutional performance, in the behavior of individuals, etc.). These indicators allow for monitoring the efficacy of a policy in achieving its outcomes. Impact indicators (long term results) are focused on measuring long term results obtained from the public action. For example, let us consider the case of child mortality as a public need or issue (see Figure 2). This problem must be outlined using a Reference Value expressing the situation prior to the action conducted. It may come from multiple sources, such as national or international statistics or administrative data (or a base line, as mentioned in section 4.2). From this analysis, outcomes to be achieved are defined (long term impact), which may be done considering the government's priorities, a comparison with peers (performance of other institutions or countries), resources available and the existence of national or international performance standards (e.g., reducing the incidence of child mortality in the rural are of Region X by 50%). An intermediate objective (intermediate outcomes), on the other hand, is the outcome to achieve after a certain period (e.g., 6 months) which helps evaluate if one is on the path to achieving the end outcome (e.g., increasing the number of mothers and children under pre and postnatal medical supervision in the rural area of Region X). Following the value chain and types of indicators, Figure 2 broadly presents the possible necessary indicators to measure a project, programme, or public policy focused on decreasing child mortality.\u00a9 OECD 2021 17 Multiple analysis objectives might exist when using indicators: Efficacy Indicators: degree of completion of the objectives set out in action programmes or missions. That is, comparing actual outcomes to those projected, independently from mediums used. Efficacy indicators are focused on what must be done. Efficiency Indicators: they track the performance of the organization when transforming resources into goods and services. They measure the level of process execution and focus on how things were done (they refer to productivity). Equity Indicators: measured based on the likelihood of disadvantaged social groups having access to public services compared to the likelihood of this happening for average groups in the country. Measuring equity means measuring the level of justice in the distribution of public services. 4.2. How are indicators designed? Indicators turn plans into something concrete and allow actors to measure progress and outcomes achieved. Although it might seem Figure 2.

Indicators may provide qualitative (categorical variables) or quantitative information (absolute numbers, percentages, or relative numbers, etc.). Regardless of their type, each indicator must be properly written (these principles are known among the classic literature as SMAART indicators). The Colombian DNP extends the criteria by defining SMAART: 1. Specific, so that the indicator is precise. 2. Measurable, so that it may be measured and validated. 3. Attainable, so that it requires reasonable costs. 4. Appropriate to measure the performance sought. 5. Relevant, so that it is pertinent to the chosen topic. 6. Time-bound, so that it may capture change in short periods of time. For example, among the objectives included in the Participatory Strategic Plan of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aire, qualitative indicators such as the \"Approved Participatory Communal Budget Act\" and quantitative indicators such as the \"Percentage of offices held by women in Community Boards\" are included. Subsequently, including a base line, a starting point for measuring progress and outcomes in relation to the initial situation is vital. This is especially useful for those indicators measuring products and outcomes. Likewise, including baseline data forces public officials to reflect on the cost of creating and sustaining monitoring in time using the chosen indicators. Finally, each indicator must be limited to a certain period, with an estimated start date and end date through which one or more goals must be achieved. These dates must be realistic, both in time and scope. The National Planning Department of Colombia has made progress in all these aspects. It has currently systematized the collection, analysis, approval, and publication processes for all its product indicators, simplifying the design of new indicators and relocating challenges mostly on the selection of goals and indicators (Box 4). Box 5. Product indicator design and selection Departmental and/or municipal governments in Colombia have product indicator catalogues at their disposal, which have been analyzed and validated by the DPN. The existence of and easy access to these products and indicators is a good practice that helps in the scheduling and monitoring work conducted by departmental and municipal governments. At the same time, it allows human resources to concentrate on defining goals, base lines, and execution dates. Additionally, if the indicator sought is not found, this information is used as a reference framework to create a new indicator. This, along with the \"Methodological guide for creating indicators\" and the \"External protocol for managing requests for products and indicators\" documents available on the DNP website, make for useful tools to properly design and prepare indicators. Source: General Adjusted Methodology (MGA, by its Spanish acronym) (DNP, 2021), https://www.dnp.gov.co/NuevaMGA/Paginas/Ayuda-de-la-MGA.aspx \u00a9 OECD 2021 19 Who participates in the creation of indicators? Initially, to identify stakeholders participating in the creation process of each type of indicator, governments may reflect on the following categories: political or executive responsible party, management or technical team leader, and citizens or interested parties. To have relevant stakeholders supporting the M&E system and benefitting from it, each indicator should be created/adopted by the person in charge of delivering the outcome and should be approved by all directly involved and interested stakeholders, according to the following principles: Input/supplies indicators8 they can be quantified by the project manager. Obtaining validation from the direct political manager is especially important, as they take up financial and physical resources assigned to their office. Process/activity indicators9 they can be developed and validated by project managers along with their technical teams, who oversee these activities. Product indicators: they should be created by political leaders with the support of project managers and may be shared with local citizens affected by or particularly interested in them. Intermediate result indicators: political leaders are responsible for defining them, as they know all products planned for and can visualize expected outcomes. 8, 9 According to the Guide for Creating Indicators (2018), input and activity indicators are subcategories of management indicators.These indicators can also involve citizen participation. Impact indicators (long term results): they may be developed by the M&E system coordination and planning team along with the highest political authorities. 4.3. How can data be collected? Once operative planning is complete, the monitoring begins. That is, each indicator connected to the value chain focused on outcomes must be effectively monitored, analyzed, and then used when making decisions and communicating information. First, it is necessary to collect data that is fed to each indicator, looking for the most appropriate, least costly methodology in each case. The most widely used methods are mentioned below (University of Oxford, 2014). Internal records: usually quantitative updated data of exceptionally low cost and easy access. They are especially useful when monitoring progress in input, activity, and product indicators. Their weakness lies in that they seldom provide data on the effect and impact of proposed objectives.Key questions Has it been verified that each indicator complies with the SMAART principles? Have the parties responsible for creating and validating indicators participated?20 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVEL Focal groups or workshops: data is usually qualitative but may be transformed into quantitative data. They are especially useful for obtaining data on the satisfaction and opinion on specific situations. They are generally used to feed data to intermediate outcome and impact indicators. Their weakness lies in the need to correctly design semi-structured question, the work dynamics, the participant selection and in having a specialized staff. Short surveys - Semi-structured interviews: data collected can be qualitative or quantitative. Data is collected through a previously defined questionnaire and mostly fed to intermediate outcome and impact indicators through the perception and opinion of citizens. Their weaknesses are their lack of flexibility and cost. Secondary information: usually quantitative, and of little to no cost. It is especially useful for intermediate outcome and impact indicators. Usually, indicators using secondary information are complemented with internal records or other kinds of primary information. Its weakness lies in the dependency on third parties and on the fact that it is complete for the purpose sought. 4.4. How often should data be collected and by whom? Regardless of how data is collected, this should be done within the time established and parties responsible for doing it must be defined. Although final decisions will depend on each project and organizational structure, underneath that a structure is proposed based on the monitoring indicators associated with the value chain focused on outcomes.Key questions Prior to initiating the monitoring: is the source of information for each indicator detailed? Was it taken into account that data collection may or may not be the least expensive and most efficient option available among all others considered? ]Input/supplies indicators Periodicity: usually monitored on a quarterly basis in connection to the budget execution. Nevertheless, this can be done each month if resource allocation varies considerably. Responsible party: the human resources and accounting department, along with the technical project team are responsible for feeding data to the indicator. ]Process/Activity Indicators Periodicity: usually monitored on a monthly basis in connection with the project's progress and coordination and adjustment meeting. Responsible party: the project manager or leader is responsible for feeding data to the indicator. ]Product Indicators Periodicity: usually monitored on a weekly basis, albeit some project use data on a quarterly or monthly basis. Responsible party: the project manager or leader, along with the political leader of the project, are responsible for feeding data to the indicator.\u00a9 OECD 2021 21 ]Intermediate Outcomes Indicators Periodicity: usually monitored annually or semi-annually. Responsible party: the central monitoring unit in coordination with the political leader of the project. In some cases, it is possible for external interested sources, such as local Observatories, to oversee monitoring results. ]Impact Indicators (long term outcomes). Periodicity: usually monitored annually or semi-annually. Responsible party: the central monitoring unit in coordination with the internal or external evaluation unit if one were to exist. Sub-national governments with best practices on the scheduling and operational execution of monitoring directly or indirectly collect all these aspects. The cases of Mannheim, Buenos Aires, and Jalisco (Box 4), which have already been mentioned, are examples of this since, with their specific characteristics, they have clearly outlined the periodicity and party responsible for feeding data to each indicator. 22 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVELBox 6. Monitoring Schedule and Operational Execution in Action In the case of Jalisco state, monitoring is conducted through the MIDE Jalisco system. It contains indicators at three levels with a state, regional, municipal, and metropolitan scope. First level indicators are connected to long term objectives, recognized both nationally and internationally. An example of this is the \"percentage of population in poverty\". Second level indicators are medium term indicators with a direct impact on the population, such as \"Kilometers of bicycle lanes in urban and metropolitan areas\". Finally, third level indicators gather short and medium- term data on the management and outcomes of government policies. One of those indicators in force is \"Trained individuals in the rural areas\". Among the indicators found in the MIDE Jalisco tool, each public programme is created by the agency in charge of executing it, under the structure detailed in the Government Operation Rules. They guarantee that programmes include at least one indicator for each step of the value chain, along with a specific budget allocated to them. To collect and update data, the system has a flexible design allowing for constant updates in which monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, and even bi-annual metrics and goals coming from internal or external sources (national and international) or surveys coexist. The system is fed by internal units from each agency in charge of the programmes or by each state Evaluation Unit coordinating the system's integration and update. Lastly, the Sectoral Citizen Boards and MIDE Lab are spaces where citizens and non-governmental stakeholders monitor indicators and objectives, propose creating or eliminating indicators and suggest participatory monitoring mechanisms for public policies. Source: https://seplan.app.jalisco.gob.mx/mide/panelCiudadano/inicio Key questions Is there an official (or area) collecting the data necessary to update the status of each indicator? Is the collection process conducted with the established periodicity?\u00a9 OECD 2021 23 4.5. How to organize, analyze and use data? The most widely used tool to organize data is the Control (or Management) Dashboard monitoring system (IDB, 2014). The Dashboard is, ideally, a computer system that facilitates monitoring throughout the value chain focused on outcomes, which helps detect deviations in relation to what was planned and make timely remedial decisions. Among the benefits of using the Dashboard is the access granted to stakeholders for uploading and centralizing data. The Dashboard must work as a tool allowing for all those involved in government management to participate, so they may systematically monitor the progress of activities and the objectives attained. The Dashboard can take data supplied, transforming, and visualizing it so that, once compared with goals, base lines and objectives, project management may be adjusted, processes may be improved, an outcome-driven culture may be fostered, multilevel decisions may be made, and progress may be communicated to citizens (IDB, 2014). In addition to this, governments develop internal reports to monitor the progress of each project and policy. Progress reports for projects are usually monthly, short, and created based on situational data and data provided by the Dashboard. The benefit of having reports is mainly that they provide data focused on a specific aim. Its main uses are: Managerial monitoring: project managers use progress reports to adjust the way activities work and allocate human resources from their technical teams. Process improvement: project managers, along with political responsible parties, use the reports to understand issues related to institutional and interinstitutional operations. Product/Results monitoring: used to consolidate monitoring and analyze products attained by one or more projects or policies. In that sense, they are used to analyze the scope of products, their outcomes and make decisions on policy based on this evidence. Multilevel monitoring: these are monitoring reports (monthly or quarterly) used by the highest authorities and their officials to monitor the progress towards meeting objectives. Having political leaders participate may entail multiple benefits, such as overcoming discrepancies among stakeholders or using unforeseen funds. It simultaneously incentivizes the progress and monitoring of projects since the work of managers and technical teams is continuously acknowledged. The cases of Pernambuco state and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires are examples of using multilevel reports as a political leadership tool in monitoring (Box 5). 24 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVELBox 7. Operational Execution of Monitoring: management monitoring in Pernambuco and CABA To minimize the risks of being caught in institutional silos and to promote vertical and horizontal coordination, the M&E systems implemented by the governments of Pernambuco, Brazil and of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA) require the active commitment of all stakeholders at all managerial and political levels. Both the Governor and the Mayor, respectively, participate in monthly meetings with Secretariats from all government areas and with their project managers to check on the progress of and obstacles to the projects and priority goals. The causes for delays and solutions to be implemented by adjusting processes and political decisions are assessed. In the case of the CABA, the monitoring system works on two levels: one monitors the strategic goals for impact, outcomes and, eventually, products. Conversely, this strategic monitoring coexists with the second level of operational characteristics. There, managers and political leaders monitor indicators and input, process and product goals. In both cases, operational monitoring is coordinated through the participation of Planning Secretariats in charge of providing technical assistance and ensuring beforehand that the content proposed by government Secretariats is placed on the execution bottlenecks. Source: Interviews and Alessandro, Lafuente y Shostak (2014) gesti\u00f3n de Pernambuco (Brasil)\" What was mentioned is also provided for in the Methodological Guide for Monitoring and Evaluating Public Policies by the DNP. For example, in \"Phase 2. Activities of the tracking process\", establishing tracking routines is suggested. These routines are directed towards incentivizing the periodical updating of data and providing for the creation of multiple reports, among which is the \"Control Dashboard\" report for visualizing the progress of indicators and goals, as well as for analyzing color coded early warnings (\"Phase 3. Products of the Monitoring System to Government Goals\") (DNP, 2014). Tools provided for in the Financial Kit11 articulate with this, such as: the master plan, which organizes annual commitments undertaken by governments in the Territorial Development Plan, and action plans, which organize actions, projects, and resources to be developed while a government is in office (DNP, 2021). \u00a9 OECD 2021 25 Key questions Does the agency have a computer tool, such as the Dashboard, connecting the entire value chain and granting access for all stakeholders to upload and/or visualize their indicators? Does the Dashboard enable the generation of reports for early deviation detection in the application of inputs, processes, and product delivery? Was the Dashboard designed to generate multiple reports useful to technical teams, managers, and political leaders? Do political leaders use monitoring to detect and solve deviations and recognize progress through system-generated reports? 4.6. How to share the monitoring progress and outcomes? Lastly, the M&E system might contribute to increasing transparency and accountability and foster trust on the part of citizens. In practice, sub-national governments have identified multiple, non-mutually exclusive strategies, among which are highlighted: External reports: usually issued annually or semi-annually, summarizing the progress status and intermediate and final outcomes achieved. Apart from making information available for citizens and stakeholders, it contributes to creating an institutional record. Comprehensive web platform: allows for the continuous update and communication of project progress, results, and impacts. In the platforms, the user has an interactive role in creating and interacting with the data base to obtain information being looked for. The Jalisco (Box 6), Mexico City and Pernambuco cases have integrated their M&E systems to open access platforms, with tools ranging from indicator filters per contribution to strategic objectives, geographical area of incidence, etc., to the visualization and free download of microdata in several formats. Website: generally located within the government's site, it is a space devoted to informing, case by case, on the status and progress of projects and their medium and long-term objectives. Even if users interact with information to a certain degree, the level of interaction when handling data is much lower. In the case of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the site is used to inform on \"Government Commitments\". The city of Mannheim has decided to include citizen participation in its website for selecting projects and sharing their progress and connection to outcome and impact indicators (Box 6). The format chosen by each sub-national government depends on variables such as technical resources available, funds that may be allocated for sharing information on monitoring and evaluation, or the development stage of the M&E system. 26 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVELSources: https://www.mannheim-gemeinsam-gestalten.de/; www.buenosaires.gob.ar/cope/estacion-de-monitoreo-del- plan-estrategico-participativo-buenos-aires-2035; https://seplan.app.jalisco.gob.mx/mide/panelCiudadano/inicio Key questions Is the progress of an administration in relation to its monitoring system shared through a preestablished, open-access institutional mechanism that is not modified based on results or political will? Does the external communication of the monitoring system enable actors to contrast progress with preestablished goals and identify the area responsible for it? Does the information obtained through the monitoring system have broader uses such as, for example, a basis for transparency and accountability processes?Box 8. Operational Execution of the Monitoring: accountability, communication, and citizen participation Having designed and implemented an M&E system, sub-national governments may, with some additional efforts, use it to increase communications and their quality, and citizen participation. There are many possible models. For example: Mannheim provides a citizens' portal in which one may check the progress status of priority projects. Each project is presented along with a timeline showing the stages and estimated delivery dates, along with their compliance. At the same time, authorities open that space up for citizen participation, both for projects that are being planned as well as for those being executed. An example of this could be receiving ideas on how squares and other specific public spaces could be remodeled. On the other hand, the government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires decided to include online information on the management progress at three levels: the first one refers to the \"Monitoring Stations\" of the 2035 Participatory Strategic Plan, where the progress status is shown for each axis and goal included in the Plan. The second one relates to the Government Plan and contains 136 objectives, with projects and goals associated to the four years the government is in office. Finally, the third level corresponds to \"Government Commitments\", a subgroup of the second level made up of specific priority policies due to their impact on citizens. Lastly, in the case of the Jaslico government, citizens can consult the monitoring of 288 indicators related to the State Development Plan. Not only can they select them according to their geographic relevance, government level or area of interest, but data can also be analyzed through the MIDE Lab application to visualize trends and historical comparisons or download them for free.\u00a9 OECD 2021 27 5. Evaluation of Public Policies: grounds and principles for undertaking the evaluation The evaluation of policies and programmes is fundamental to learn more, improve decision- making based on evidence, redesign programmes or policies, and have more accountability about the actions of the government, since it provides a structured, objective analysis to understand if a public policy and/or programme has led to the results expected in terms of (OECD, 2020): Relevance: to what extent do the initial objectives align with the needs or issues to be tackled. Efficacy: to what point were the expected effects and changes achieved, and do they align with planned objectives. Efficiency: given the effects and changes achieved, funds disbursed are justified. Impact: which is/are the effect/s of the intervention and how has/have it/they been, considering short and long-term, direct, or indirect effects, etc. However, the evaluation is probably the least developed link within the public policies cycle. Regardless of the existing financial, human resources and capacity limitations faced by many sub-national governments, which act as obstacles when planning evaluations, countries such as Colombia present opportunities for conducting evaluations with the national government or with external stakeholders. 5.1. Who oversees promoting the evaluations? To cover the previously described minimum functions, sub-national governments the evaluation system to have a stable institutional arrangement, in many cases through an evaluation unit or institution. For this, each government may define the form that suits it best, among which evaluation units or institutions are highlighted: Internal government unit: the unit that depends on the Executive Branch and is responsible for selecting, undertaking and/or hiring evaluations to be conducted. In cases surveyed, these areas are often the same as or connect to planning and monitoring actions, with the benefit that they exploit previously generated information and maximize the inclusion of lessons learned. Examples of this are the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Pernambuco, or Jalisco. In turn, internal units may conduct evaluations using their own technical resources, or delegate their execution to third parties and retain a selection and coordination role. External unit: refers to cases in which the evaluation unit is outside of the sphere of the sub-national government. In such cases, institutions carry out the entire evaluation process as external agents. This option provides more independence from the government and more flexibility for allocating technical resources but, at the same time, poses two challenges: in the first place, an external unit lacks power to select and conduct evaluations on government programmes and policies; secondly, it is possible for political agencies to be less open to collaborating with the evaluations and adopting their recommendations.28 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVELSources: https://www.evalua.cdmx.gob.mx/evaluacion/evaluacion-de-programas-sociales; Sub-National Evaluation Units Sub-national governments with best practices for evaluation systems in charge of internal units show that they have been institutionalized. Units created in the Jalisco and Pernambuco states, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, and Mexico City generally share the following characteristics: Planning and monitoring are organically connected, closing a virtuous circle that allows for taking advantage of economies of scope. They provide workshops, instructions, and continuous support to other agencies to expand the culture and capacity to adopt evaluation. The execution and coordination of evaluations may be led by a Unit or by areas responsible for the project or policy. The selection of projects or policies to be evaluated is done through a periodical selection and publishing. Necessary funds are specifically allocated, either through the public budget or trusts. The focus or scope of each evaluation unit varies based on the government being analyzed. The Social Development Evaluation Council of Mexico City (Eval\u00faa CDMX) exclusively evaluates programmes and policies connected to social development. Meanwhile, the Pernambuco and Jalisco states or the CABA include areas as diverse as infrastructure, education, taxes, etc., in their evaluations. Key questions Has the agency formally created an internal or external evaluation unit with power to conduct or coordinate the evaluations? Is the evaluation unit intricately linked to the planning area? Does the evaluation unit develop guides, trainings, and works with agencies executing projects and policies so they may detect and support the evaluations? Is there a clearly established relation between the policy, plan and/or project monitoring and evaluation conducted by the sub-national government?\u00a9 OECD 2021 29 5.2. Which are the determining factors when selecting the programmes and policies to be evaluated? Starting from programmes and public policies strongly linked to medium and long-term strategic objectives, sub-national governments may choose which ones to evaluate. Examples of parameters considered in impact evaluations are: Coverage of potential and target population: refers to the number or percentage of inhabitants or companies that will be affected by the programme in relation to the target population. Budget allocated: refers to financial efforts the programme requires, in total terms and in relation to all other projects. Disruption and Innovation: refers to the magnitude of the social change that the programme or policy intends to bring forth. Scalability: refers to the possibility of expanding the programme both in time and in terms of target population. Citizen's interest: refers to the programmes that emerge as highest priorities for citizens. Even when weighing each element depends, in the end, on the idiosyncrasy of each government, such as on its institutional capabilities or on necessary intra-governmental and multilevel coordination, each element helps obtain a clear format for prioritizing and determining which projects and policies will be evaluated.Key questions Were the programmes to be evaluated selected based on an analysis including criteria such as: magnitude of expenditure or investment, level of population coverage, possible scalability, and citizens' interest, among others? 5.3. What type of evaluation and intervention opportunities to choose? Governments may be motivated to evaluate projects or policies to gain an in-depth understanding of the financial outcome, design, processes executed, outcomes, or impacts generated (IDB, 2014). Likewise, evaluations can be conducted before (ex-ante), during (ex dure) or upon completing the execution of a project (ex post). Financial evaluation: it can be conducted ex-ante to estimate a project or policy's costs and outcomes and decide on its viability, or ex post as part of an impact analysis. Among its many variants, the cost- efficacy and cost-efficiency evaluations is noted. Design evaluation: it allows actors to comprehensively analyze the Change Theory or Logical Framework on which the project or public policy is based. If conducted ex-ante, it improves the likelihood for success of the issue being tackled. If conducted ex post, it allows actors to visualise improvement opportunities, both for scalability as well as for other programmes. Process evaluation: it may be conducted ex dure or ex post. The former allows actors 30 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVELto analyze how the project execution works until the promised products are delivered. Results evaluation: usually conducted ex post but may be done ex dure. It allows actors to analyze bottlenecks, how a project was executed and its general performance. Impact evaluation: it is conducted ex post to determine if (and by how much) a project has effectively contributed to produce the changes envisioned, be they social, behavioral, economical, etc. Independently from the evaluation type used, the M&E system must ensure, through its governing body, that the evaluations are defined well in advance (ideally in the annual planning, during the planning stage), that they are properly justified, and that they complement the information collected during the monitoring stage. Box 10. Choosing Evaluations and Evaluation Types in Sub-National Governments The mechanisms, determinants, and types of evaluations conducted vary depending on the experience observed. While some sub-national governments follow annual planning and publishing practices for programmes to be evaluated, others conduct evaluations without such a level of institutionalization. Examples of the former are Jalisco and Mexico City which, through the Evaluation Unit and the Evaluation Council, respectively, coordinate and decide on the programmes to be assessed both internally and externally. For each evaluation, a specific type (design, process, outcome, etc.) is specified, and by including execution deadlines and, in the case of Jalisco the origin of the funds (federal or state funds) together with the cost, execution is connected to expenditure, thus increasing transparency, and allowing for stakeholders to track these processes. On the other hand, the government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires has an Evaluation Unit which coordinates and executes the evaluation of key projects, both using its own technical resources, as well as external evaluators. In this case, the evaluations are conducted without a previous official publication Sources: www.evalua.cdmx.gob.mx/; seplan.app.jalisco.gob.mx/evalua/; www.buenosaires.gob.ar/planificacionycoordinaciondegestion/ unidad-de-evaluacion \u00a9 OECD 2021 31 5.4. How to promote the quality and use of the evaluation when making decisions? The quality of evaluations is key to having robust evidence that allows actors to understand and make strategic public policy decisions. At the same time, it is necessary to promote the use of evaluations through the policy cycle, so they can become input for strategic decision-making, learning, maintaining trust among citizens and for the government's communications. To ensure the quality of evaluations, sub- national governments must consider at least three dimensions (OECD, 2020): Systematization: Evaluations should be conducted under preestablished processes and plans. Additionally, systematization ideally includes clear criteria guiding (either with a decision-making theory or something else) the prioritization of and decisions on the programmes evaluated. In this respect, having official documents with clear principles and objectives might be useful. Rigor: a quality evaluation must provide conclusions supported by applying duly designed and executed methodologies. The final choice will depend on multiple factors, among which are the type of evaluation conducted (design, product, etc.), the kind of data available, the funds allocated for it and the time in which it is expected to be conducted. Objectivity: an impartial analysis must be guaranteed to minimize internal and external factors which might bias evaluations. Albeit not in itself sufficient, if the evaluation is rigorous, there is a helpful framework for this. Having people with technical knowledge, removed from political pressures participate in the evaluation contributes to ensuring objectivity. This does not necessarily mean that the evaluation must be conducted by an external unit; if conducted by an internal unit, institutional mechanisms should be set up to guarantee a degree of autonomy. Hiring an independent, external auditor or coordinator, for example, might help. The quality and use of evaluations are inherently connected. The availability of quality evaluations incentivizes their use and, in turn, if authorities and stakeholders use them, there is a natural tendency to demand quality evaluations. The opposite, a vicious cycle, is equally true. According to the first survey on evaluations of public policies conducted by the OECD (2020), one of the main challenges in promoting an evaluation policy is the use of evaluations conducted. In that context, and to foster the use of evaluations, sub-national governments might consider, among others, the following tools (OECD, 2020): The objective of the evaluation must be clear and simple, so that its practical relevance is explicit. The methodology, along with the data quality and availability processes used for the evaluation, must be made available to verify results. Results must be presented in a simple, accessible manner: quality evaluations, especially impact evaluations, are often connected to estimation techniques that are relatively removed from the general knowledge of citizens and policy makers. To bridge this gap, sub-national governments may actively work using presentation formats that are accessible to non- specialized audiences.32 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVEL The dissemination of results among citizens and stakeholders must be preestablished. Collaborating with the third sector and international organizations may help disseminate and validate results. The use of evaluations must be part of someone's job: institutionalizing and Key questions Are evaluations conducted based on a formal, preestablished outline that allows for prioritizing and selecting programmes to be annually assessed (or assessed in other timeframes)? Does the selection of a project or programme to be assessed include a description of and justification for the methodology to be used? Are internal or external stakeholders participating directly or indirectly to guarantee that results are objective and collectively appropriated? systematizing them helps develop rigorous evidence. Assigning staff connected to the evaluations to the discussion on and design of new policies might be an effective way to use what has been learned (Carter, Dhaliwal, Katticaran, Mac\u00edas, & Walsh, 2018).\u00a9 OECD 2021 33 6. Final Conclusions The construction and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system is an evolving, continuous process that sub-national governments may adjust to their needs and capabilities. Experiences found show that there is no single format that fits all sub-national governments. At the same time, analyzing the good practices from M&E systems enables us to extract the following lessons learned: Long and medium-term objectives, defined during the planning stage, become robust when they are connected to public policies and government projects through a comprehensive outline (logical framework or change theory) that allows for monitoring and evaluation of the entire public value chain. Monitoring and evaluation systems should include the participation of all stakeholders involved in planning and executing public policies. Including at least one indicator meeting the SMART criteria (with responsible parties, goals, and baselines) in each milestone of the value chain is key for an effective, efficient monitoring. The participation of citizens is fundamental for identifying, making visible, legitimizing, and prioritizing local needs, accounting for the progress and impact of policies, and promoting high levels of trust in the M&E system. Project and policy evaluations are linked to monitoring and conducted within a stable institutional framework through a clear allocation of responsibilities, through predictable processes and measures that guarantee the quality of the evaluation. Recognizing the significant challenge posed by evaluations, sub-national governments may incentivize their use through specific actions, such as by collaborating with external stakeholders or disseminating their use among them, or by presenting results in a simple way for non-specialized audiences. Lastly, a solid M&E system does not happen on its own. Monitoring and evaluation systems that serve multiple purposes (learning and improving project execution, creating early warnings for deviations, adjusting, and correcting the implementation of programmes and policies along the way, and communicating with society and stakeholders, and being accountable, among others) have specific processes and tools for that reason. In that sense, it is key to have political leadership that fosters and uses the M&E system. 34 PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM AT THE SUB-NATIONAL LEVEL Aquilino, N., Potenza, F., & Rubio, & Walsh, C.
