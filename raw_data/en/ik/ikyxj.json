Like the time when warm powdered sugar and cinnamon wafting into the air reminded you of Grandma's home made pancakes on Sunday mornings? Or you caught a whiff of Old Spice...

Often, people use a steam diffuser, which works like a humidifier and disperses the aroma of the oils into the air. Others use essential oil-scented candles, especially for spiritual meditation. If you don't have either, you can use of boiling water to release the aroma of oils. This is a process called steam diffusion. Here's how to do it: Boil 2 cups of water. Pour it into a glass, ceramic bowl or a wooden bowl. Add 5-10 drops of your essential oil. Place the bowl in the same room where you will perform your practice. The steam for the boiled water will heat the oil and disperse its scent into the air. A word on safety Many essential oils have been shown to be safe when used as directed. Having said that, essential oils in their pure form are potent and may cause irritation. Dilute them with carrier oils otherwise a single drop or two into the diffuser will do.
