Liu, BS,1 Ngoc-Tram Michael Wadie Najm, MD1,5 Abstract Objectives: To (1) determine the attitudes, perceptions, and use of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine among undergraduate students; (2) assess whether these students would benet from more academic exposure to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and promotion of integrative medicine (IM); and (3) gauge the need and desire of undergraduates, particularly pre-health learners, to take courses about CAM/IM. Methods: This cross-sectional electronic survey study was conducted on the campus of the University of California (UC) Irvine. Selection criteria included being at least 18 years of age and a current undergraduate at UC Irvine. All survey responses were collected between November 20, 2010, and June 1, 2011. The data were analyzed by using Stata software, version 11-SE (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Results: Completed surveys were received from 2839 participants (mean age of respondents, 20.2 years). Thirty-ve percent had used CAM within the past 12 months, and 92.8% believed CAM to be at least somewhat effective; however, only 31% had prior education on CAM. After adjustment for variables, familiarity and belief in effectiveness were both highly linked to the use of CAM, with ascending odds ratios (ORs; 95% condence interval [CI]) of 2.1 (1.3-3.4), 4.9 (3.0-7.8), and 12.7 (6.9-23.4) among increasing categories (all p < 0.01). Sex (OR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.01-1.56]; p < 0.05), Asian ethnicity (1.46 [1.14-1.88]; p < 0.01), and prior education (1.26 [1.01-1.57]; p < 0.05) were also signicantly correlated to the use of CAM after adjustment. Most respondents indicated that they were likely to take a CAM college course if it fullled a graduation requirement (63.6%) or was offered within their major (56.4%). Conclusions: Overall, this large-scale study supports the ideas that education plays a pivotal factor in the decision to use CAM and that there is a large demand for additional CAM knowledge among college students. Introduction Integrative Medicine refers to the holistic practice focusing on health promotion and disease prevention by combining evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments with conventional, or Western, treatments. CAM is the phrase used to dene medical treatments and techniques that are not part of conventional care. Alternative medicine includes treatments that are used instead of conven- tional therapies, while complementary medicine includes non- conventional treatments that are used in conjunction with conventional treatments.1 The range of CAM treatments in- clude, but are not limited to, acupuncture, yoga, exercise, herbal medicine, massage, chiropractic, mind-body modalities, and homeopathy.2 A study conducted by the National Institutes of Health in 2007 showed that 38.3% of adults had used some form of CAM treatment in the past 12 months to treat conditions such as back pain, headaches, colds, arthritis, anxiety, depression, cholesterol problems, and reoccurring pain. Some of the major reasons adults used CAM therapies included the following: the potential for supplementary benets of CAM alongside con- ventional medicine, the potential to treat unique illnesses beyond Presented in part at the 2012 IM and Health Consortium in Portland, Oregon. 1 Susan Samueli Center for Integrative Medicine, afliated with School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, Costa Mesa, CA. 2 Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Vallejo, CA. 3 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston, MA. 4 Department of Sociology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA. 5 Department of Family Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA.

DOI: 10.1089/acm.2014.0041 1 the scope of conventional medicine, the avoidance of unwanted side effects, and the lower relative costs of CAM therapies.3 CAM has become increasingly prevalent in both the medical eld and the general population in the United States; this raises concerns for safety, information, and efcacy.4 Many medical, nursing, pharmacy, and public health schools in the United States have responded to this growing con- cern by providing CAM courses for health providers.4 Par- ticularly, the number of U.S. medical schools reporting inclusion of CAM into their curricula increased from 46 to 75 schools out of 125 between 1996 and 1999, respectively.5 Lack of CAM education in the undergraduate curriculum and data on undergraduate familiarity with CAM Current undergraduate education on CAM is sparse. Only ve universities in the United States offer CAM degrees, and research suggests that the overall percentage of college stu- dents who have been exposed to any CAM subject material is minimal in both undergraduate and professional school lev- els.6 A study from San Francisco State University identied a disparity between students' high level of interest in CAM and the low availability of CAM courses. Of the undergraduate students surveyed, 97% favored the creation of a CAM major because CAM courses were closely relevant to the students' lives and helped them reduce their stress levels and because the courses changed their dietary and exercise routines for the better.6 Also of note, studies that reported close to 40% of people who completed some college work had used some form of CAM in the past 12 months despite the lack of education on CAM at the undergraduate level.3 Because of the applicable nature of CAM to health professional schools, most research had focused on perception and attitude of CAM in medical, pharmacy, nursing, and public health schools. Currently there is a lack of research on the perceptions and use of CAM among undergraduate college students.6 Reasons for CAM education in the undergraduate curriculum It has been suggested that CAM education in U.S. col- leges would increase the effectiveness of the country's health practitioners.4 CAM education may be most bene- cial in the undergraduate curriculum because it may be too late for students to gain sufcient understanding of CAM or even develop an interest in CAM when rst exposed to it at the graduate level in pharmacy, nursing, or medical school.4 One likely reason for such a trend is that the compacted curricula of schools for health professions prevent an in- crease in the course load with topics on CAM. In addition, even with the increased exposure to CAM education in medical school, medical doctors were not found to report increased CAM discussion with their patients.7 Perhaps earlier exposure to CAM would encourage medical practi- tioners to discuss CAM with their patients as an option. Pre- health professionals and other undergraduates will also benet from education on CAM because the undergraduates may develop healthier lifestyle habits and increase their overall knowledge, self-worth, and well-being.6 To address these questions, this study sought to (1) deter- mine the attitudes, perceptions, and use of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine among undergraduate students; (2) assess whether they would benet from more academic exposure to CAM and promotion of integrative medicine (IM); and (3) gauge the need and desire of under- graduates, particularly pre-health learners, to take courses about CAM/IM. Materials and Methods Participants and procedures This cross-sectional electronic survey study was conducted on the campus of the University of California (UC) Irvine in southern California. The campus's undergraduate population consists of 21,976 students with an average age of 21 years. The UC Irvine Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study. The survey in this study collected so- ciodemographic information, including age, sex, race, birth status, years in the United States, college standing, major, and career interests. Participants were asked about their past and current use of CAM, perceptions of the effectiveness of CAM, and their level of interest in CAM education. A free- response question asked for the conditions that prompted their use of CAM. Several questions labeled ''multiple se- lect'' allowed students to select for multiple responses among available choices. A denition of CAM derived from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine was provided, and responses were dened by self- report: ''CAM is the phrase used to dene medical treatments and techniques that are not part of conventional care. Com- plementary and Alternative medicine includes treatments that are used instead of or along with conventional therapies such as synthetic/pharmaceutical drugs and surgery.'' The range of CAM treatments include but are not limited to acupunc- ture, yoga, tai chi, herbal medicine, massage, chiropractics, Ayurveda, homeopathy, and vitamins/minerals/supplements. Several terms used in the current study, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine and naturopathy, include multiple mo- dalities. These are dened according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. (See Appen- dix for detailed survey information and denitions.) The different schools within UC Irvine granted permission to distribute the survey to their undergraduate students. Selection criteria included being at least 18 years of age and a current undergraduate at UC Irvine. Emails weresent to each individual within their respective academic department, with a link di- recting the participant to the survey on the university's Elec- tronic Educational Environment (EEE). EEE is a secure and interactive platform that students use to access course materials and conduct course evaluations, among other school-related activities. Participation was voluntary, and 20 randomly se- lected participants received a $20 gift card at the end of the process as an incentive, indicated in the consent form. Students were required to log in to their UC Irvine electronic account in order to access the survey; however, the system only provided a participation list, and responses were not linked to individuals. EEE also automatically ensured that none of the students took the survey more than once. All survey responses were collected between November 20th 2010, and June 1, 2011. Data analysis Data were processed and analyzed by using Stata software, version 11-SE (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). The data 2 LIU ET AL. were summarized primarily through frequency values and valid percentages, and measures of variability were reported by using mean- standard deviation. The Pearson chi-squared test was used to compare between pre-health and non- pre-health students on their education preferences. Multi- variable modeling procedures used a combination of forward stepwise selection guided by a priori knowledge based on literature review to assess factors associated with CAM use. Level of signicance was reported at a 5% a level. Non- responses totaling < 5% were omitted from the data; other- wise, the number of respondents are indicated in the tables. Results Characteristics of sample Of a population of 21,976 undergraduates at UC Irvine during the year 2010-2011, completed surveys were received from 2839 participants with a mean sample age of 20.2 - 2.40 years. The study sample is representative of the overall UC Irvine undergraduate population, with the exception of a higher proportion of women (69% in study sample versus 53% overall) (Table 1). The majority of surveyed participants were Asian (53.1%), reflecting UC Irvine's student body, and had at least some familiarity with CAM (64.3%); 92.8% believed CAM to be at least somewhat effective, but only 31% had prior education on CAM (Table 2). CAM use Women were more prominent users of CAM than men, and those familiar with CAM or with strong beliefs in its effectiveness were much more likely to use CAM (Table 3). A total of 1265 (45.2%) surveyed participants reported prior use of some form of CAM in the past in response to a general question (Table 2). However, given a list of CAM treatments, 1806 (63.4%) respondents indicated using at least one type of treatment. Of these respondents, the most widespread treatments used were supplements (60.8%), mas- sage (50.1%), body movement (38.5%), herbal medicine (35.4%), and Traditional Chinese Medicine (30.1%). The least commonly used treatments included Ayurveda (3.0%), hyp- nosis (2.0%), and naturopathy (1.1%) (Table 4). Of the 1587 students who indicated reasons for using CAM, friend/relative recommendation was the top justication (53.8%), followed by efciency/effectiveness of treatment (37.1%), curiosity (36.2%), and personal philosophy (33.0%). The most major reasons for not using CAM from the 1384 respondents were having been healthy (55.8%), lack of familiarity (49.5%), and lack of physician recommendation (37.1%) (Table 5). In stepwise logistic regression analysis, sex [OR], 1.26; 95% and prior CI, 1.01-1.57; p< 0.05) were signicantly correlated to the use of CAM after adjustment for variables in our study (Table 6). Being pre-health or a 5th-year student was only signicantly associated with use of CAM Table 1.

UC IRVINE UNDERGRADUATES: CAM USE AND ATTITUDES 3 before adjustment. Familiarity and belief in effectiveness were both highly linked to the use of CAM after adjustment, with ascending ORs of 3.87 (95% CI, 3.08-4.88), 23.36), respectively, among increasing categories (p< 0.01). CAM education Among the respondents, 798 had prior education in CAM modalities (Table 7). Most students attained education on CAM through reading a book (61.2%), taking a college course (33.2%), or attending a seminar (15.7%). Over half of those with prior education cited an interest in further CAM use (54.0%) or a future career involving CAM (52.0%). Among those with prior education, pre-health students were signi- cantly more likely than non-pre-health students to pursue further education (p<0.01), further CAM use (p<0.05), or a future career involving CAM (p<0.01). Furthermore, most of the 2783 respondents indicated that they were likely to take a CAM college course if it fullled a graduation requirement (63.6%) or was offered within their major (56.4%). Only 20.5% were not interested in taking a CAM course, with sig- nicant differences (p<0.01) observed between pre-health (9.1%) and non-pre-health students (29.6%). Almost one third (36.5%) of surveyed students were interested in a CAM major, also with a statistically signicant difference (p<0.01) be- tween pre-health (53.2%) and non-pre-health students (23.9%). Discussion To date, this is the largest comprehensive study of attitudes and use of CAM of undergraduate students in the United States. Our study population included approximately 35.1% current CAM users, which is similar to the results described by a recent undergraduate study in Houston (35.8%)8 and the National Health Interview Survey of 2007 (38%).3 However, other college studies reported high variations in use, from 58%9 to 78%,10 probably due to differences among CAM Table 3.

Although only 45.2% of the students in the current study stated ''yes'' to using CAM during their lifetime, 63.4% selected at least one answer choice in a follow-up question for the specic types of CAM modality they had used. This inconsistency demonstrates the confusion among many students regarding what constitutes CAM, despite being provided a general denition. Of the CAM treatments indicated in our study, the most used therapies, consisting of supplements, massage, body movement techniques, Traditional Chinese Medicine, herbal medicine, and chiropractic, were consistent with the 2007 National Health Interview Survey data and other similar studies.3,9-11 This may be due to the widespread commer- cialization and marketing of these treatments and insurance coverage of several of these therapies.12,13 Among the ndings was a disparity between the high use of herbal medicine and the low use of naturopathy, which is inclusive of herbal medicine, probably due to confusion over the term naturopathy, which was not addressed in our survey. The most commonly reported conditions for CAM included cold/flu, musculoskeletal conditions, muscle pain, stress and anxiety, and headaches/migraines, which paralleled the current literature; however, participants did not report ar- thritis or cholesterol problems, probably because college students do not usually experience those symptoms.3,9 Stu- dents' most common reasons for using CAM stemmed from friend/relative recommendations and beliefs in efciency, similar to those of the Houston undergraduate study,8 and the high influence of a specic personal philosophy was similar to the results of Astin's national study.14 The current study additionally found that curiosity contributed to the decision to use CAM for many respondents. This study si- multaneously examined the reasons students did not use CAM, and good health and lack of knowledge were the most cited causes. While good health was consistent with another study targeting the disuse of CAM among a private Cali- fornia institution, lack of knowledge was not a major factor Table 6.

UC IRVINE UNDERGRADUATES: CAM USE AND ATTITUDES 5 in that study; those participants instead attributed their disuse of CAM primarily to the lack of provider support.15 This suggests that people in different age groups may have dif- fering values and reasons regarding their choice to use CAM. Past ndings have shown that those with higher education are associated with higher uses of CAM;16 the current study also found that prior familiarity was correlated with higher CAM use. While Asians and whites typically have the highest percentages of CAM use, studies have shown vari- ation between the two groups. Some have shown Asians as more likely users of CAM than whites,17,18 as equally like- ly,19 or as less likely.3 In part, these differences may be attributed to the heterogeneity within Asian subgroups with regard to culture, lifestyle, and behavior.20 After adjustment for demographic and educational factors, Asians in the cur- rent study were the only ethnic group that signicantly dif- fered from whites and were more likely to use CAM. However, whereas age has positively correlated with use of CAM in other studies,8,9 this was not a major impact after adjustment in the current study. This is probably due to the inclusion of class standing as a covariate, which, while sig- nicant initially, was no longer signicant after adjustment for education variables. Therefore, this study suggests that the differences associated with age or increased class level are primarily due to educational factors. Prior CAM educa- tion was a strong predictor of CAM use, and it appears that at least some of this relationship can be explained by increases in familiarity and beliefs in effectiveness. Consistent with other studies, women were more likely to use CAM than were men.8,10,16 Enrollment in a pre-health track was sig- nicantly associated with CAM use before adjustment of education factors but was insignicant after adjustment, in- dicating that pre-health students may be more likely to seek knowledge of CAM. Overall, belief in effectiveness and familiarity were the strongest predictors of CAM use. This study has a few limitations. First, because the study was cross-sectional, causation cannot be directly established. Second, survey responses were based on self-reported data, so recall bias may have affected the results. Additionally, any potential confounders not included in the survey data would not have been controlled for in this study. Because this was a voluntary study, there may also have been re- sponse bias from those who chose to participate in the sur- vey. As discussed earlier, ambiguity over the denition of CAM and its modalities among students may have influ- enced the CAM use data; this reflects the lack of clarity in the denitions/terms understood by undergraduates. The strength of this study is the large sample representative of the undergraduate population at this major university. Future studies should consider a nationally representative sample of undergraduates because there has not been such a study to date. Additionally, studies may consider the timing and du- ration of undergraduate CAM use as well as the specic conditions prompting their use. Furthermore, future studies should investigate the communication between undergradu- ates and their physicians or CAM practitioners. With such a substantial portion of the undergraduate population using CAM therapies, it may be advantageous for universities to provide more resources in health centers on the proper use of these treatments. In addition, a substantial portion of undergraduates who use CAM are entering the healthcare eld, and including CAM in undergraduate edu- cation would provide a strong foundation given the lack of appropriate CAM education in health professional schools. Because many of these students will become future physi- cians and healthcare providers and given the increased in- terest and use of CAM among the general population, providing a good foundation would allow for better re- sponsiveness to patient's interest and practice. If health professional schools are not able to educate future health Table 7.

In conclusion, this large-scale study supports the idea that education plays a pivotal factor in one's decision to use CAM, and that there is a large demand for additional CAM knowledge among college students. Because many of the ndings reflect national adult CAM characteristics, the un- dergraduate level may be the ideal source of implementation to address these demands.
