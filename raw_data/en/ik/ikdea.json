Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures1. Calculate the required dose (mg) of TRODELVY based on the patient's body weight at the beginning of each treatment cycle (or more frequently if the patient's body weight changed by more than 10% since the previous administration) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)]. Allow the required number of vials to warm to room temperature. Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, into each 180 mg TRODELVY vial. Each vial contains overfill to compensate for liquid loss during preparation and after reconstitution, the total resulting volume delivers a concentration of 10 mg/mL . Gently swirl vials and allow to dissolve for up to 15 minutes. Do not shake. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear and yellow. Do not use the reconstituted solution if it is cloudy or discolored. Use immediately to prepare a diluted TRODELVY infusion solution. Dilution Calculate the required amount of the reconstituted TRODELVY solution needed to obtain the appropriate dose according to the patient's body weight. Determine the final volume of the infusion solution to deliver the appropriate dose at a TRODELVY concentrat ion range of 1.1 mg/mL to 3.4 mg/mL. Use 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP only since the stability of the reconstituted TRODELVY solution has not been determined with other infusion-based solutions. Use a polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene/polyethylene, polyolefin, or ethylene vinyl acetate infusion bag. Withdraw and discard the volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the final infusion bag that is necessary to achieve the indicated TRODELVY concentration following the addition of the calculated amount of reconstituted TRODELVY solution. Reference ID: 5119880 Withdraw the calculated amount of the reconstituted TRODELVY solution from the vial(s) using a syringe. Discard any unused portion remaining in the vial(s). To minimize foaming, slowly inject the calculated amount of reconstituted TRODELVY solution into the infusion bag. Do not shake the contents. If not used immediately, the infusion bag containing TRODELVY solution can be stored refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 24 hours protected from light. After refrigeration, administer diluted solution at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) within 8 hours (including infusion time). Do Not Freeze or Shake. Administration Administer TRODELVY as an intravenous infusion. Protect infusion bag from light. The infusion bag should be covered during administration to the patient until dosing is complete. It is not necessary to cover the infusion tubing or to use light -protective tubing during the infusion. An infusion pump may be used. Do not mix TRODELVY, or admin ister as an infusion, with other medicinal products. Upon completion of the infusion, flush the intravenous line with 20 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS For injection: 180 mg off -white to yellowish lyophilized powder in a single -dose vial. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS TRODELVY is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction to TRODELVY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Neutropenia Severe, life -threatening, or fatal neutropenia can occur in patie nts treated with TRODELVY. Neutropenia occurred in 64% of patients treated with TRODELVY. Grade 3 -4 neutropenia occurred in 49% of patients. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 6% of patients. The median time to first onset of neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia) was 16 days and has occurred earlier in some patient populations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . Neutropenic colitis occurred in 1.4% of patients. Withhold TRODELVY for absolute neutrophil count below 1500/mm3 on Day 1 of any cycle or neutrophil count below 1000/mm3 on Day 8 of any cycle. Withhold TRODELVY for neutropenic fever. Dose modifications may be required due to neutropenia. Administer G -CSF as clinically indicated or indicated in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.2 Diarrhea TRODELVY can cause severe diarrhea. Diarrhea occurred in 64% of all patients treated with TRODELVY. Grade 3 -4 diarrhea occurred in 11% of all patients treated with TRODELVY. One patient had intestinal perforation following diarrhea. Diarrhea that led to dehydration and subsequent acute kidney injury occurred in 0.7% of all patients. Withhold TRODELVY for Grade 3 -4 diarrhea at the time of scheduled treatment administration and resume when resolved to Grade 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. At the onset of diarrhea, evaluate for infectious causes and if negative, promptly initiate loperamide, 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea for a maximum of 16 mg daily. Discontinue loperamide 12 hours after Reference ID: 5119880 diarrhea resolves. Additional supportive measures (e.g., fluid and electrolyte substitution) may also be employed as clinically indicated. Patients who exhibit an excessive cholinergic response to treatment with TRODELVY (e.g., abdominal cramping, diarrhea, salivation, etc.) can receive appropriate premedication (e.g., atropine) for subsequent treatments. 5.3 Hypersensitivity and Infusion-Related Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions including life -threatening anaphylactic reactions have occurred with TRODELVY treatment. Severe signs and symptoms included cardiac arrest, hypotension, wheezing, angioedema, swelling, pneumonitis, and skin reactions [see Contraindications (4)]. Hypersensitivity reactions within 24 hours of dosing occurred in 35% of patients treated with TRODELVY. Grade 3 -4 hypersensitivity occurred in 2% of patients treated with TRODELVY. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of TRODELVY was 0.2%. The incidence of anaphylactic reactions was 0.2%. Premedication for infusion reactions in patients receiving TRODELVY is recommended . Have medications and emergency equipment to treat infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, available for immediate use when administering TRODELVY [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Closely monitor patients for hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions during each TRODELVY infusion and for at least 30 minutes after completion of each infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Permanently discontinue TRODELVY for Grade 4 infusion -related reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.4 Nausea and Vomiting TRODELVY is emetogenic. Nausea occurred in 64% of all patients treated with TRODELVY. Grade 3 -4 nausea occurred in 3% of patients. Vomiting occurred in 35% of all patients treated with TRODELVY. Grade 3 -4 vomiting occurred i n 2% of these patients. Premedicate with a two or three drug combination regimen (e.g., dexamethasone with either a 5 -HT3 receptor antagonist or an NK 1 receptor antagonist as well as other drugs as indicated) for prevention of chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Withhold TRODELVY doses for Grade 3 nausea or Grade 3 -4 vomiting at the time of scheduled treatment administration and resume with additional supportive measures when resolved to Grade 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Additional antiemetics and other supportive measures may also be employed as clinically indicated. All patients should be given take -home medications with clear instructions for prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting. 5.5 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity Patients febrile neutropenia, and anemia; and may be at increased risk for other adverse reactions when treated with TRODELVY. The incidence of neutropenia and anemia was analyzed in 948 patients who received TRODELVY and had UGT1A1 genotype results patients heterozygous for the of Grade patients homozygous for the of the incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia was 21%. In patients heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele, the incidence of Grade 3 -4 anemia was 10%. In patients homozygous for the wild -type allele, the incidence of Grade 3 -4 ane mia was 9%. The median time to first neutropenia including febrile neutropenia was 9 days in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele, 15 days in patients heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele, and 20 days in patients homozygous for the wild -type alle le. The median time to first anemia was 21 days in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele, 25 days in patients heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele, and 28 days in patients homozygous for the wild-type allele. Closely monitor patients with known reduced UGT1A1 activity for adverse reactions. Withhold or permanently discontinue TRODELVY based on clinical assessment of the onset, duration and severity of the observed adverse reactions in patients with evidence of acute early -onset or unusually severe adverse reactions, which may indicate reduce d UGT1A1 enzyme activity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, TRODELVY can cause teratogenicity and/or embryo -fetal lethality when administered to a pregnant woman. TRODELVY contains a genotoxic component, SN -38, and targets rapidly dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.3)]. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The follo wing adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Diarrhea (5.2)] Hypersensitivity and Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precauti ons (5.3)] Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The pooled safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to TRODELVY in 1063 patients fr om four studies, IMMU -132-01, ASCENT, TROPiCS-02, and TROPHY which included 366 patients with mTNBC, 322 patients with hormone receptor -positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -negative (HER2-) breast cancer, and 180 patients with mUC. TRODELVY was administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles at doses of 10 mg/kg until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among the 1063 patients treated with TRODELVY, the median duration of treatment was 4.1 months (range: 0 to 63 months). In this pooled safety population, the most common ( > 25%) adverse reactions including laboratory abnormalities were decreased leukocyte count (84%), decreased neutrophil count (75%), phosphatase (28%), magnesium (27%), decreased potassium (26%), and decreased sodium (26%). Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple- Negative Breast Cancer Reference ID: 5119880 ASCENT Study The safety of TRODELVY was evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled, ope n-label study (ASCENT) in patients with mTNBC who had previously received a taxane and at least two prior chemotherapies. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either TRODELVY (n=258) or single agent chemotherapy (n=224) and were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. For patients treated with TRODELVY, the median duration of treatment was 4.4 months (range: 0 to 23 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 27% of patients receiving TRODELVY. Ser ious adverse reactions in > 1% of patients receiving TRODELVY included neutropenia (7%), diarrhea (4%), and pneumonia (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.2% of patients who received TRODELVY, including respiratory failure (0.8%) and pneumonia (0.4%). TRODELVY was permanently discontinued for adverse reactions in 5% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in 1 % of patients who received TRODELVY were pneumonia (1%) and fatigue (1%). Adverse reactions leading to a t reatment interruption of TRODELVY occurred in 63% of patients. The most frequent (5%) adverse reactions leading to a treatment interruption were neutropenia (47%), diarrhea (5%), respiratory infection (5%), and leukopenia (5%). Adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction of TRODELVY occurred in 22% of patients. The most frequent (>4%) adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction were neutropenia (11%) and diarrhea (5%). Granulocyte -colony stimulating factor (G -CSF) was used in 44% of patients who received TRODELVY.

TRODELVY was administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles at doses up to 10 mg/kg until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median treatment duration in these 108 p atients was 5.1 months (range: 0 to 51 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of the patients. Serious adverse reactions in > 1% of patients receiving TRODELVY (each 2%). TRODELVY was permanently discontinued for adverse reactions in 2% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation were anaphylaxis, anorexia/fatigue, headache (each 0.9%). Forty - five percent (45%) of patients experienced an adverse reaction leading to treatment interruption. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment interruption was neutropenia (33%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 33% of patients treated with TRODELVY, with 24% having one dose reduction, and 9% with two dose reductions. The most common adverse reaction leading to dose reductions was neutropenia/febrile neutropenia.

Reference ID: 5119880 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, TRODELVY can cause teratogenicity and/or embryo -fetal lethality when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. TRODELVY contains a genotoxic component, SN -38, and is toxic to rapidly dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1)]. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major bir th defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4% and 15 - 20%, respectively. Data Animal data There were no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies conducted with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy or SN -38 in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 month after the last dose of TRODELVY. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of TRODELVY. Contraception Females TRODELVY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Females Based on findings in animals, TRODELVY may impair fertility in females of reproductive p otential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of TRODELVY have not been established in pediatric patients. Reference ID: 5119880 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 366 patients with TNBC who were treated with TRODELVY, 19% of patients were 65 years and 3% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and younger patients. Of the 322 patients with HR+/HER2 - breast cancer who were treated with TRODELVY, 26% of patients were 65 years and older and 6% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and younger patients. There was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients ag ed 65 years or older (14%) compared with younger patients (3%). Of the 180 patients with UC who were treated with TRODELVY, 59% of patients were 65 years and older and 27% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and younger patients. There was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients aged 65 years or older (14%) compared with younger patients (8%). 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No adjustment to the st arting dosage is required when administering TRODELVY to patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The safety of TRODELVY in patients with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3.0 \u00d7 ULN) or severe (total bilirubin > 3.0 \u00d7 upper limit of normal [ULN]) hepatic impairment has not been established. TRODELVY has not been tested in patients with AST or ALT > 3 ULN without liver metastases, or AST or ALT > 5 ULN with liver metastases. No recommendations can be made for the starting dosage in these patients. 10 OVERDOSAGE In a clinical trial, planned doses of up to 18 mg/kg (approximately 1.8 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg/kg) of TRODELVY were administered. In these patients, a higher incidence of severe neutropenia was observed. 11 DESCRIPTION Sacituzumab govitecan -hziy is a Trop -2 directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, composed of the following three monoclonal antibody, hRS7 IgG1 (also called T rop-2 trophoblast cell antibody to SN -38. The recombinant monoclonal antibody is produced by mammalian (murine myeloma) cells, while the small molecule components SN -38 and CL2A are produced by chemical synthesis. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy contains on average 7 to 8 molecules of SN-38 per antibody molecule. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has a molecular weight of approximately 160 kilodaltons. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has the (sacituzumab govitecan -hziy) off-white to yellowish lyophilized powder for intravenous use in a 50 mL clear glass single-dose vial, with a rubber stopper and crimp-sealed with an aluminum flip -off cap. Each single-dose vial of TRODELVY delivers govitecan -hziy, 77.3 mg 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic aci d mg polysorbate 80 and 154 mg trehalose dihydrate. Reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, results in a concentration of 10 mg/mL with a pH of 6.5. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sacituzumab govite can-hziy -2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. Sacituzumab is a humanized antibody that recognizes Trop -2. The small molecule, SN -38, is a topoisomerase I inhibitor, which is covalently attached to the antibody by a linker. Pharmacology data sugges t that sacituzumab govitecan -hziy binds to Trop-2-expressing cancer cells and is internalized with the subsequent release of SN-38 via hydrolysis of the linker. SN topoisomerase I -induced single strand breaks. The resulting DNA damage leads to apoptosis and cell death. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy decreased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of triple -negative breast cancer. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The TRODELVY exposure-response relationships and pharmacodynamic time course for efficacy have not been fully characterized. Cardiac electrophysiology The maximum mean change from baseline was 9.7 msec (the upper bound of the two -sided 90% confidence interval is 16.8 msec) at the recommended dose. A positive exposure -response relationship was observed between QTc increases and SN-38 concentrations. n Where receiv ed sacituzumab govitecan -hziy as a single agent at a dose 10 mg/kg. The pharmacokinetic parameters of sacituzumab govitecan -hziy and free SN-38 are presented in Table 10. Table 10: Summary of Mean PK Parameters Cmax: maximum serum concentration from 0- 168 hours after the first dose AUC 0-168: area under serum concentration curve through 168 hours after the first dose Distribution Based on population pharmacoki netic analysis, steady state volume of distribution of sacituzumab govetican -hziy is 3.6L. Elimination The median elimination half (t 1/2) of sacituzumab govitecan -hziy and free SN-38 in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer was 23.4 and 17.6 hours, respectively. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated mean (%CV) clearance of -hziy is (SN -38G) in the serum of patients. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetic analyses in patients treated with TRODELVY did not identify an effect of age (27 to 88 years), race (White, Black, or Asian), or mild renal impairment to moderate renal impairment(CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min) on the pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. Renal elimination is known to contribute minimally to the excretion of SN-38, the small molecule moiety of sacituzumab govitecan -hziy. There no data on the pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan -hziy in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min), or end -stage renal disease (CLcr < 15 mL/min). Patients with Hepatic Impairment The exposure of sacituzumab govitecan -hziy is similar in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ULN with AST > ULN, >1.0 to 1.5 ULN with any AST; n=257) to patients with normal hepatic (total bilirubin AST < ULN; n=526). Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy and free SN-38 exposures are unknown in patients with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3.0 \u00d7 ULN) or severe (total bilirubin > 3.0 \u00d7 ULN) hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy or its components. Inhibitors or inducers of UGT1A1 may increase or decrease SN-38 exposure, respectively Drug Interactions (7)]. Reference ID: 5119880 12.5 Pharmacogenomics SN-38 is metabolized via UGT1A1 [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Genetic variants of the UGT1A1 gene such as the UGT1A1*28 allele lead to reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity. Individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and anemia from TRODELVY compared to individuals who are wildtype (*1/*1) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Approximately 20% of the Black or African American population, 10% of the White population, and 2% of the East Asian population are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (*28/*28). Approximately 40% of the Black or African American population, 50% of the White population, and 25% of the East Asian population are heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (*1/*28). Decreased function alleles other than UGT1A1*28 may be present in certain populations. 12.6 Immunogenicity The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti -drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti -drug antibodies in other studies, including those of TRODELVY. During the median 4-month treatment period across clinical studies in patients treated with TRODELVY, 9 (1.1%) of 785 patients developed antibodies to sacituzumab govitecan; 6 of these patients (0.8% of all patients treated with TRODELVY) had neutralizing antibodies against sacituzumab govitecan. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of sacituzumab govitecan is unknown. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with sacituzuma b govitecan -hziy. SN-38 was clastogenic in an in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test in Chinese hamster ovary cells and was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. Fertility studies with sacituzumab govitecan -hziy have not been conducted. In a repeat -dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, intravenous administration of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy on Day 1 and Day 4 resulted in endometrial atrophy, uterine hemorrhage, increased follicular atresia of the ovary, and atrophy of vaginal epithelial cells at doses 60 mg/kg ( 6 times the human recommended dose of 10 mg/kg based on body weight). 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple -Negative Breast Cancer ASCENT Efficacy was evaluated in a multicenter, open -label, randomized study (ASCENT; NCT02574455) conducted locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who had relapsed after at least two prior chemother apies for breast cancer (one of which could be in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting provided progression occurred within a 12 month period). All patients received previous taxane treatment in either the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or advanced stage unless there was a contraindication or intolerance to taxanes during or at the end of the first taxane cycle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine brain metastases was required prior to enrollment for patients with known or suspected brain metastases. Patients with brain metastases were allowed to enroll up to a pre- defined maximum of 15% of patients in the ASCENT study. Patients with known Gilbert's disease or bone -only disease were excluded. Reference ID: 5119880 Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TRODELVY 10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day (n=267) or physician's choice of single agent chemotherapy (n=262). Single agent chemotherapy was determined by the investigator before randomization from one of the following Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome was progression -free survival (PFS) in patients without brain metastases at baseline (i.e., BMNeg) as measured by a blinded, independent, centralized review assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. Additional efficacy measures included PFS for the full population (all patients with and without brain met astases) and overall survival (OS). The median age of patients in the full population (n = 529) was 54 years (range: 27 to 82 years); American; and 81% of patients were < 65 years of age. All patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 ( 43%) or 1 (57%). Forty -two metastases, BRCA1/BRCA2 status positive, and 70% were TNBC at diagnosis . Twelve percent had baseline brain metastases previously treated and stable (n=61; 32 on TRODELVY arm and 29 on single agent chemotherapy arm). Overall, 29% of patients had received prior PD -1/PD -L1 therapy. Thirteen percent of patients in the TRODELVY group in the full population received only 1 prior line of system ic therapy in the metastatic setting. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 11 and are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Efficacy results for the subgroup of patients who had received only 1 prior line of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting (in addition to having disease recurrence or progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant/adjuvant systemic therapy) were consistent with those who had received at least two prior lines in the metastatic setting.

The median PFS in the TRODELVY arm was 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.5, 3.9) and the median PFS with single agent chemotherapy was 1.6 months (95% CI: 1.3, 2.9). Exploratory OS analysis in the same population Reference ID: 5119880 showed a stratified HR of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.63). The median OS in the TRODELVY arm was 6.8 months (95% CI: 4.7, 14.1) and the median OS with single agent chemotherapy was 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.7, 11.1). IMMU -132-01 The efficacy of TRODELVY was evaluated in a multicenter, single-arm, study (NCT01631552) that enrolled 108 patients with metastatic triple -negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who had received at least two prior anticancer therapies for metastatic disease. Patients with bulky disease, defined as a mass >7 cm, were not eligible. Patients with treated brain metastases not receiving high dose steroids (> 20 mg prednisone or equivalent) for at least four weeks were eligible. Patients with known Gilbert's disease were excluded. Patients received TRODELVY 10 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day treatment cycle. Patients were treated with TRODELVY until disease progression or intolerance to the therapy. Tumor imaging was obtained every 8 weeks, with confirmatory CT/MRI scans obtained 4-6 weeks after an initial partial or complete response, until progression requiring treatment discontinuation. Major efficacy outcome measures were investigator assessed overall response rate (ORR) using RE CIST 1.1 and duration of response. The median age was 55 years (range: 31 to 80 years); 87% of patients were younger than 65 years. The majority of patients were female (99%) and White (76%). At study entry, all patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (29%) or 1 (71%). brain metastases. Twelve patients (11%) had Stage IV disease at the time of initial diagnosis. The median number of prior systemic therapies received in the metastatic setting was 3 (range: 2 to 10). Prior chemotherapies in the received prior taxanes and 86% had received prior anthracyclines either in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting. Table 12 summarizes the efficacy results.

Single agent chemotherapy was determined by the investigator before randomization from one of the following factors: prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease (2 vs. 3 -4), visceral metastasis (Yes or No), and endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting for at least 6 months (Yes or No). Patients were treated until disease progressio n or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of TRODELVY was permitted beyond RECIST -defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. The primary efficacy outcome measure was PFS as determined by BICR per RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy measures included OS, ORR by BICR, and DOR by BICR. The median age of patients in the study population was 56 years (range: 27- 86 years), 26% of patients were 65 years or over. The majority of patients were female (99%); 67% were White, 4% were Black and 3% were Asian, and 26% were of unknown race. Patients received a median of 7 (range: 3 to 17) prior systemic regimens in any setting and 3 (range: 0 to 8) prior systemic chemotherapy regimens i n the metastatic setting. Approximately 42% of patients had 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for treatment of metastatic disease compared to 58% of patients who had 3 to 4 prior chemotherapy regimens and all patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (45%) or 1 (55%). Ninety-five percent of patients had visceral metastases. Most patients received endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting for 6 months (86%). TRODELVY demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS and OS versus single agent chemotheraphy. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 3 and Figure 4.

Prior to the administration of TRODELVY, all patients were treated for prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea, vomiting and infusion reactions. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 66 years (range: 33 to 90 years), 78% were male, 74% were White, 3% Asian, 3% Black and 20% unknown. All patients had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (28%) or 1 (72%). Ninety -six percent of patients had disease; 67% patients had visceral metastases, including 34% with liver metastases. The median number of prior systemic therapies was 3 (range: 1 to 8). Sixty -five percent of patients received prior cisplatin, 21% received prior carboplatin, 13% received both prior cisplatin and carboplatin, and PD - 1 or PD -L1 inhibitor. For 34% of patients, the platinum -containing chemotherapy was received in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting only. Nine percent of patients received prior enfortumab vedotin.
