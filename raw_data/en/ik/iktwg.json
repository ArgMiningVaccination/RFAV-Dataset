Nutritional supplements include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and enzymes and they aid in improving overall health and wellness. It is always recommended to get your nutrition through your food, but for some people who do not consume a nutritious diet, they may be insufficient or deficient in certain vitamins and nutrients that support proper bodily functioning. Supplements are not used to simply control symptoms or as a replacement for a prescription drug but as a means to support and optimize proper bodily functioning. At Phoenix Integrative Medical Center, we take an integrative approach by addressing the underlying causes of disease and implementing appropriate treatments of conventional pharmaceutical interventions with lifestyle modifications and nutritional supplementation that safely and effectively address the symptoms of the individual. After taking a comprehensive history and physical in combination with lab testing if needed, we determine what dietary supplements are needed to support your body allowing you to achieve your maximum potential. We always recommend nutraceutical or pharmaceutical grade supplements that are higher in purity and do not contain additional additives or preservatives allowing for better absorption and increased bioavailability.
