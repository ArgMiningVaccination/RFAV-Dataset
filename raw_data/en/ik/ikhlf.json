People who eat a well-balanced diet tend to be healthier with stronger immune systems and a lower risk of disease. As always, it's important to eat a variety of fresh and unprocessed foods every day to get the vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein, and antioxidants your body needs. The following tips can help you keep your immune system healthy and nourished. Please note that none of these suggestions should be interpreted as a cure or prevention for COVID-19. What is the Immune System? Your immune system is a complex network of different systems, cells, tissues, and organs that come together to defend your body. It protects our body against foreign substances and germs such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. One important part of your immune system is the lymphatic system, consisting of bone marrow, the spleen, lymph nodes, and the thymus. All of these elements work together to produce white blood cells, which circulate throughout the body, find germ-invaders, and attack them. Protecting and maintaining the health of our white blood cells is essential to a healthy immune system. Immune Boosting Foods Generally, diets that are high in fresh, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts & seeds, legumes, and whole grains plant based foods help keep your immune system strong. If you are having difficulty accessing your favorite fruits and veggies, look to frozen or canned vegetables \u2014 frozen fruits and vegetables can act. Be careful with canned fruits and fruit juices, as these can be high in sugar. Limiting dietary fat and sugar, and increasing a variety of vitamins and minerals, can help create more effective white blood cells. Whole foods, like fruits, vegetables, grains, and yogurts, often have special types of fiber or contain beneficial microbes that support healthy gut bacteria. Cultivating healthy gut bacteria has also shown to be beneficial to aid in immunity. If you have an abundance of fruits and vegetables one week, you can chop them up and freeze them for later use. Overall, remember that you can make choices that benefit your health and can improve your immune system with some effort and time. Even introducing one new serving of fruits or vegetables per day in your diet can help boost your immune system. In general, eating more whole foods than processed foods, choosing varieties of fruits and vegetables, and eating an overall balanced diet will keep our immune system strong. Whole foods, like whole fruits, vegetables, and grains, contain more nutrients and fiber than the parts of these foods, like fruit or vegetable juice, or processed white breads. Try to limit the amount of processed foods you're eating, and remember that sugar hides itself in a lot of products. As much as you can, try to read the labels on processed foods and limit your intake of sugar. Garlic \u2014 Regular consumption of garlic, either raw or cooked, may decrease the occurrence of seasonal colds in adults. However, research on garlic and cold viruses is limited. Elderberry Extract \u2014 Some studies have shown elderberry extract to help stop influenza virus from multiplying inside the body (please note that this does not imply it may be effective against COVID-19). Elderberry also contains vitamins A and C which are essential for immune health. Ginger & Turmeric \u2014 Turmeric contains curcumin, which is responsible for turmeric's anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antibacterial properties. Studies have shown that the antioxidant properties of both ginger and turmeric can help reduce inflammation, which may help reduce the risk and symptoms of many illnesses. Apple Cider Vinegar \u2014 While studies have shown that Apple Cider Vinegar has antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, there is no strong evidence that it helps treat colds or any viruses. It may help ease cold symptoms like loosening mucus, but again, it is not a treatment. Immune Boosting Vitamins and Minerals Different colors of foods offer different nutrients and vitamins.

Spending time in nature can decrease your likelihood of Vitamin D deficiency, as well as increasing your white blood cell count. There is even some new research suggesting that exposure to microbes in the soil may help protect against allergies and other inflammatory diseases. Get Plenty of Sleep \u2014 Getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night will help keep your immune system in fighting shape. Lack of sleep (less than 6 hours per night) weakens our immune response. Stay Hydrated \u2014 Lastly, drink plenty of water! Depending on your body type, activity level, and diet, you will need different amounts of water.
