She mentioned the mid -term study break event currently taking place in the Graham Cent er, adding that student government continue s its efforts to increase on -campus engagement while also increas ing student presence at University athletic events. In response to Trustee Sarnoff, Trustee Valdes remarked that physical distancing requirements and the unavailability of numerous on-campus dining establishments serve as deterrents for students who wish to spend time on campus. In response to Board Vice Chair Roger Tovar, Senior Vice President for Administration and Chief Financial Officer Kenneth A. Jessell pointed out that there are approximately 10 available on -campus food venues, and he comment ed on plans being developed with Chartwells to expand the number of available on-campus food venues, as this would provide for increased variety and options .

Board Vice Chair Tovar asked Trustee Valdes for additional recommendations that can help to further repopulation efforts. Trustee Valdes remarked that traditional on-campus, in-person learning should be an option for students that prefer said modality. In response to Committee Chair Low ell, Trustee Valdes mentioned that outdoor student events have been taking place but with limited attendance. 6. Faculty Senate Updates Trustee Reinhold, Faculty Senate Chair, reflected on the prior 11 months that began with the directive to transition to remote instruction. He commented that while in -person instruction does not require certification , prior to being considered for hybrid course instruction, certification is required. He added that during said certification training, faculty members are exposed to evidence- based teaching practices, curriculum development, and assessment planning. He remarked that due to the transition to remote, training courses were oversubscribed, which resulted in additional sections being offered and ultimately , three times as much faculty becoming certified. Trustee Reinhold indicated that, in addition to the hybrid teaching certification, faculty members engaged in other available training opportunities such as the remote readiness certification. He s tated that while not necessarily an indicator of student learning outcomes , passing rates for remote courses are comparable to that of online or in-person courses. He referenced a controlled compa rison that analyzed a specific math course over the last three spring semesters , adding that student learning outcomes were generally consistent. Trustee Reinhold commented on the fall student poll, pointing out that approximately half of respondents indicated that they preferred remote instruction for the spring semester. Trustee Reinhold mentioned that most students are electing to participate remotely for classes that have an Page 7 of 252DRAFTFlorida International University Board of Trustees DRAFT Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee February 23, 2021 Minutes Page | 8 in-person option, despite the availability of space in the classroom . He remarked on increased student satisfaction rates as they relate to remote instruction . He referred to the recent Miami Herald article , commenting on faculty concerns regarding the related push to repopulate FIU campuses in the spring semester . He added that faculty are more receptive to returning to pre-COVID conditions in the fall semester. Trustee Valdes remarked that remote learning incentiv izes academic dishonesty and added that while there may be a section of the student population that is satisfied with remote instruction, an even greater number is dissatisfied. She commented that remote instruction was borne out of necessity and the circumstances of the moment and that moving forward , students should continue to have the same learning options as they did prior to COVID- 19 conditions, specifically, in -person, online, and hybrid. Trustee Reinhold reiterat ed that students are opting for remote learning despite having the option of attending class in -person. Trustee Valdes commented that there is increased comfort in attending classes remotely and added that removing remote instruction as an option helps to ensure that students have a presence on campus , thereby allowing them to benefit from the available on -campus resources. Board Chair Dean C. Colson suggested to Committee Chair Lowell that the discussion be continued at the Full Board Meeting that is scheduled later in the day. There were no objections. 7. New Business No new business was raised. 8.

EE3325 - Applied Quantum Mechanics fo r EE An introductory course designed to provide students with a fundamental understanding of (1) electron energy, electron/ photon interaction, and electron energy transitions ; (2) electromagnetic wave theory and quantization of photon energy ; (3) laser theory and operation; and (4) advanced applications such as quantum d ots, zener diodes and resonant tunneling diodes . This includes applying boundary conditions to solve the time - independent Schr\u00f6dinger's equation , normalization of the wave function, and applying fundamental solutions such as the infinite potential well ( particle -in-a-box) and finite potential well to laser , quantum dot and tunneling applications. 2. EE43 77/EE53 81 - Applied Photovoltaics Semiconductors have emerged as the most promising class of materials that can convert sunlight directly into electrical energy. This course presents the fundamental principles of the solar energy conversion process and the most common cell technologies are discussed. A range of semiconductor materials are discussed for their potential use in photovoltaic applications, considering the material properties that affect the device performance, including efficiency, cost and environmental conditions (e.g., terres trial or space applications and duration of sunshine), and the availability and toxicity of the raw materials. This course will also cover a range of fundamental problems and the relationship between the physics, material science, and technology aspects of solar cell development. Students will learn the fundamental and quantitative principles of the solar energy, as well as its potential economic and societal impact. 3. EE4395/EE5380 - Renewable Energy and Energy Sustainability Energy is a major key to indu strial development and a worldwide economy. Constantly growing demand for energy that relies on a finite supply of fossil fuels, presents challenges for scientists, engineers and governments to explore and develop alternative sources of energy that are con tinuous, renewable and environmentally friendly. This course provides important knowledge about many aspects of renewable energy sources. This course assesses the current and potential future energy systems, covers resources, extraction, conversion, and en d-use, and emphasizes meeting regional and global energy in the 21st century in a sustainable manner. Students will learn the fundamental and quantitative principles of the renewable energy options, as well as their potential economic and societal impact. 4. EE4395/EE5390 - Semiconductor Material and Device Characterization Semiconductor material and device characterization has continued to advance with the development of new techniques and the improvements in existing techniques. This course presents the fundamental principles of many of the characterization techniques used in the semiconductor industry. Concepts and theory underlying the techniques are reviewed, and Page 126 of 2528 selected experimental results are presented. Emphasis is on techniques employing electrica l, optical and physical/chemical characterization, including scanning probe techniques: X -ray fluorescence, contactless lifetime/diffusion length measurements, and charged -based techniques including transmission electron microscopy through the use of focus ed ion beam sample preparation. 5. EE43 50/EE5390 - Device Electronics for Integrated Circuits The impact of integrated circuits (ICs) and semiconductor devices on engineering and on the broader society continues to grow. ICs contain tens -of-millions of activ e devices on a chip. The majority of chips are formed of silicon and the majority of devices are metal - oxide -semiconductor (MOS) field -effect transistors (MOSFETS), which displaced the formerly dominant bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). This course pro vides an overview of the physical electronics of semiconductors, silicon technology, IC fabrication, pn junctions, bipolar transistors, and MOSFETS.

I felt that this class further stimulated my interest in electrical engineering. *** Excellent instructor, knows what she is talking about and likes it. It looks like she likes to teach and challenge students. She cares for her students but is strict at the same time. You can see that she enjoys when the student s question what she is teaching. Meaning that she makes the students to be more involved in the class. *** Amazing professor and teaching methods were great. *** Loved this course and the professor! Comment #2: Fall 2017 EE3325 The class was very interes ting and engaging. The professor kept us engaged with the content and always had new ways of teaching us about the material. *** I absolutely loved Dr. Hodges class. I went to every single class waking up at 6:30am every day happy to go to class because s he was such an awesome lecturer and made class fun every single class .

Background Information: In 2019, in conjunction with the renaming of the former doct orate in Curriculum and Instruction to Teaching and Learning, the faculty of the doctorate in Exceptional Student Education created a new area of specialization (Special Education) in the revised PhD program. This provided students the ability to earn a Do ctor of Philosophy. Since that time, new students have been pursuing the PhD (the preferred credential) rather than the EdD ESE. Stu dents not wishing to enroll in the PhD had the option to continue in the EdD ESE; these students who availed themselves of t his option have now graduated from the EdD ESE. The program faculty determined that it is now time to close the original degree give n the popularity and success of the new specialization in the PhD in Teaching and Learning and to consolidate degree offerin gs. Section (1 d) of Florida Board of G overnors Regulation 8.012 -Academic Program Termination and Temporary Suspension of New Enrollments states Each University Board of Trustees has the responsibility and authority to recommend termination o f degree prog rams at the professional and doctoral level to the Board of Governors .

This report enhances the System's commitment to accountability and strategic planning by fostering greater coordination between institutional administrators, University Boards of Trustees and the Board of Governors regarding each instit ution's direction and priorities as well as performance expectations and outcomes on institutional and System -wide goals. Once an Accountability Plan is approved by each institution's respective Boards of Trustees, the Board of Governors will review and consider the plan for approval, excluding those sections of the Plan that require additional regulatory or procedural approval pursuant to law or Board regulations. Page 210 of 2522021 ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN Florida International University 4 STRATEGY Mission Statement Florida International University is an urban, multi -campus, public research university serving its students and the diverse population of South Florida. We are committed to high -quality teaching, state -of-the-art research and creative activity, and collaborative engagement with our local and global co mmunities. Statement of Strategy FIU is the place of big ideas and close connections. Those big ideas and close connections became critical for us this past year as we were able to affirm our commitment to our academic and research mission and serve our community during this global pandemic. The broad reach, through research and community engagement, and our meaningful relationships, driven by faculty and staff who care deeply about every student , allowed us to pivot while continuing our critical work. As the FIU community moves forward with a strategic plan designed for the 21st century, we are poised and ready to take the University to its Next Horizon of student success and research excellence. This vision of FIU's Next Horizon Strategic Plan is drive n by bold thinking. It is fueled by an energized and hard -working student community and outstanding faculty conducting cutting -edge research, world -class programs, innovation, and future -forward teaching that has made FIU a fast -rising top 50 public resear ch institution. This past year affirmed that FIU's strategy and direction to wards a more 21st century lifelong learner institution of higher education was timely. COVID -19 served to accelerate the technological advances and the rise of artificial intelli gence that are transforming society and revolutionizing everything - how we communicate, work and play. This year as we reflect and plan ahead , our strategy continues to drive us to broaden our research and transition to an evolving mindset that prioritize s lifelong learning and delivers a personalized learning experience sensitive to changing workforce needs and competencies. As an anchor in our community and a driver of economic prosperity, FIU's strategy is to work with industry and government leaders to ensure that South Florida is poised to support the entire state of Florida through a robust economic recovery that is inclusive of our students, staff, and faculty. The Next Horizon Strategic Plan continues to guide our efforts, unprecedented opportun ities and obligations to impact our community more deeply and to lead more boldly in areas of teaching, research, entrepreneurship, and public policy. The future of FIU is full of promise, hope and opportunity. Page 211 of 2522021 ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN Florida International University 5 STRATEGY (cont.) Strengths, Opportunities & Challenges Our strengths and opportunities for the foreseeable future must continue to be framed in a context of responding to the twin dilemmas presented by the COVID -19 Pandemic: how to foster a new normal in which public health can be assured and how to restore Florida's economy so that Florida's workforce returns to full employment in a context of ascending prosperity. FIU's core strengths to assist with this process lie in our can -do organizational culture, our purpose -driven instit utional ethos, and our hard -driving community that thrives on uncertainty, innovation and creativity. Innovation is certainly key here as Florida and Miami/South Florida are particularly experiencing a catalytic movement. South Florida is poised to affirm its place as a global leader and great city. The greatest cities of the world have strong public research universities and FIU is ready to not only respond to industry but to partner in innovative and transformational ways to ensure that the foundation required to support talent generation and qualit y standards of living are developed to sustain the long -term economic strengths of our community and our state. We intend to maintain our drive to be ranked as a top -50 public university in national rankings including U.S. News & World Report . We are ad apting to respond to the immediate talent and workforce needs of the rapidly expanding technical and innovation sector in our community. Florida's movement t owards tech innovation and a state that welcomes and foster s business and business development requires us to be ready . We are ready for the new challenges. We are confident about our ability to respond and succeed in the face of the new urgency presented by the pandemic and the post -COVID opportunities presented by the unprecedented relocation of com panies to South Florida. Three Key Initiatives & Investments 1. Amplify Learner Success & Institutional Affinity Student success is intricately tied to a greater sense of institutional affinity, individual grit, a well -nurtured sense of belonging, and optimism towards the future. The university initiatives and investments will continue to focus on this critical aspec t and ensure that the post -pandemic recovery is heralded by the continued retention and graduation success of our students. Our learner -centric model is also supporting the just -in-time needs of our students and graduates responding to a very expansive and agile workforce focused on the innovation and venture capital economy. 2. Accelerate Preeminence & Research and Innovation Impact Our second key initiative is designed to achieve our 2025 strategic plan goals. We are leveraging FIU preeminent and emerging preeminent programs and our program of distinction in Environmental Resilience. We have achieved $237M in total research expendit ures, placing us on a path to surpass our prior 2025 goal of $300M. We made similar progress in S&E and non -Medical S&E expenditures, surpassing the Preeminence metric for S&E research expenditures, having reached $210M. In total research, our NSF ranking improved 7 places to No. 74. This year FIU's NIH research funding increased by 38% reaching $44M and placing FIU third in the SUS. Our aim remains for FIU to be the catalyst to foster social innovation and entrepreneurship from conceptualization to commer cialization. 3. Assure Responsible Stewardship Our last key initiative is driven by the recognition that FIU has a deep responsibility to be good stewards of our resources: human, economic, environmental, and entrepreneurial. Two major initiatives grab our attention. First, our university -wide DEI program is focused on leveling the playing field for diverse communities who seek opportunity and to make their contributions to our prosperity. Another initiative is our program of distinction on Environmental Resilience which presents a holistic approach to build a strong and sustainable future for our institution and the South Florida community. The optimization and impact of our academic and research enterprise requires us to align resources with academic pri orities that sustain knowledge production, optimize learning, discovery and creativity, and promote a positive working environment. Page 212 of 2522021 ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN Florida International University 6 STRATEGY (cont.) Graduation Rate Improvement Plan Update In FIU's 2018 Graduation Improvement Plan, we highlighted the importance of identifying and resolving the student - level and institutional -level obstacles to timely graduation. At the time, our 4 -Year FTIC Graduation rate was 33.5 %. In the three years si nce that plan was published, we have continued to focus on removing the barriers that impede students' progress. This year, our graduation rate stands at 49.3%. We continue to build the infrastructure to support continued and sustainable improvement in t he graduation rate. FIU has developed processes and strategies to continuously review and refine our student support efforts and initiatives. One of the primary tools is FIU's Communication Protocol for Accountability and Strategic Support (ComPASS). ComP ASS is a data driven management process used by the President, Provost, Deans, and staff to monitor the university's instructional, curricular, and operational needs and their impact on FIU's mission and position relative to the State's Performance Funding Model and rankings. The process consists of workshops that provide an open discussion and in -depth data analysis with each college to identify best practices, challenges, and opportunities. Additionally, general sessions are held semesterly with the Presi dent, Provost, Executive team, Deans, and their staff to identify and evaluate resources, support, and adjustments needed for positive improvement. In April 2020, the university held its 13th ComPASS session which focused on efforts to assist students to g raduate on time and improve retention. FIU's approach to student success is centered on developing critical collaborations throughout the university to identify and resolve barriers students are encountering. Through the facilitation and management of numerous cross - unit working groups, FIU is addressing academic and financial barriers at both the student and institutional level. These working groups come together to ensure that university course offerings facilitate timely graduation, the use of holds preventing students from registering is closely monitored, and students who are experiencing academic and financial difficulties are supported. These collaborative working groups give the university the agility and dexterity needed to address and resolve issues as they arise. Additionally, we have invested in software solutions that help to build and maintain these critical collaborations. Panther Success Network (PSN, powered by EAB) is FIU's Advisor -Student Case Management system. PSN has b een facilitating Advisor to Student interaction and support since 2018. In 2020, FIU expanded the use of the PSN platform to include other university offices (Care Units) to enhance the coordinated support for student success. The following care units were recently added: Center for Academic Success (Tutoring); Career and Talent Development (Career Services); College Life Coaching; Financial Wellness Coaching; Multicultural Programs and Services; Student Access & Success; and the Center for Testing and Care er Certification. These additional care units are using the PSN platform to collaboratively assist students by issuing and receiving student referrals between care units, reading and entering contact notes, scheduling student appointment s, and messaging st udents. In the coming year, w e will continue to expand the scope of the platform and the number of units working together to support students. These critical collaborations also include working with the faculty. The Gateway Project, led by FIU's Center fo r the Advancement of Teaching (CAT) initially identified critical courses with high enrollment, high failure rates, and/or high impact (strong predictor of dropping out or delayed graduation) in 2014 -15. The Gateway Project includes communication and colla boration with and amongst department chairs, structured faculty work sessions, and gateway course data collection and analysis. The goal of the sessions is to improve course design and pedagogy with a focus on student learning and success. Since the incept ion of the Gateway Project over 21,000 more students have passed 21 foundational \"gateway\" courses than would have at the 2013 -14 passing rates (21 courses with > 35,000 enrolled students annually, including Biology, Chemistry, English, History, Psychology , Math, Statistics, Economics). The average passing rate across these courses has increased from 65% to 82%. The reach of the project has expanded to Gateway to Graduation (G2G), which will provide support for improving student success in courses that have historically slowed progress toward graduation.

Key Achievements for Last Year (Student, Faculty, Program, Institutional) From 2019 to 2020 research awards grew from $157M to $197M (a 25% increase). Six startup companies were created based on FIU technologies , the largest number in the history of FIU . Thirteen license options were executed and licensing income totaled $236K. Over $1M in research funding was received in connection to a license option. FIU was awarded 61 patents in the fields of renewable energy, medicine, computer science, engineering, and more. This maintains FIU's rank among the top 25 public universities in the world fo r the number of U.S. utility patents produced according to the 'Top 100 Worldwide Universities Granted U.S. Utility Patents in 2019' report. The Air Force Office of Scientific Research awarded FIU an extension additional $4.82 M to expand its groundbreakin g research on origami antennas through the Transforming Antennas Center. The USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance , awarded a $4.2 M, three -year cooperative agreement to the FIU Extreme Events Institute Disaster Risk and Resilience in the Americ as program. Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work Professor Kim Tieu and his team received a $6.6M NIH grant to study how brain cells die in Parkinson's disease and to develop effective drug therapies for Parkinson's. FIU was recognized as the University of Distinction in Environmental Resilience by the Board of Governors. FIU joined the Global Council for Science and the Environment to address environmental sustainability in the world through linking actionable science to national and in ternational policy. FIU was ranked by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings as #1 in Florida, #3 in the US, and #9 in the world impact on life below water FIU was ranked #1 in the US training students to make a difference in the climate cris is by College Magazine. FIU hosted The Role Of Water, a focused national dialogue in Washington, D.C. that explored opportunities for federal, state, local, corporate and university collaboration on solutions and technologies relating to water quality, wat er resilience and long -term restoration efforts. The discussion was the launch of a national initiative led by FIU to increase recognition of the importance of water quality research and multi -sector collaboration. FIU's Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy and Applied Research Center was awarded year two of the Intelligence Community Centers for Academic Excellence Critical Technologies and Intelligence Program. The overall grant is $2 million over three years and brought in local educational partner s. FIU, in partnership with Florida Power & Light, established the Artificial Intelligence -based Renewable Microgrid at our Engineering Center. The one of its kind \"living lab\" allows for research, design, study, simulation of future renewable power plant , microgrid, resiliency and many aspects of the smart grid. The global health pandemic crisis has resulted in over 110,000 restaurants closed permanently, and the Chaplin School is the only hospitality program in the country that stepped up and created the SOBEWFF\u00ae and Chaplin School Hospitality Industry Relief Fund, which has distributed over $1.6 M in grants to independently owned and operated restaurants and bars in Miami -Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. CARTA Miami Beach Urban Studios 3D printed and assembled more than 6,363 face shields for front line workers and minority -owned businesses, healthcare workers and those serving the disabled. FIU medical student Jennifer Knight was awarded a National Health Service Corps Scholarship by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The award is an incentive for students to practice primary health care in underserved urban, rural and frontier communities hardest hit by the doctor shortage. FIU was once again named one of the best colleges in the nation to work for by the Great Colleges to Work For program. The university also achieved honor roll designation with recognition in all 12 categories . FIU created the Equity Action Initiative to identify and implement initiatives that can begin the lifelong work to impactfully address the issues of inclusion , and equity. A core advisory group was tasked to review and recommend initiatives to enhance equality, dignity, inclusion and belonging in an effort to seek permanent reforms that will make our community and our world a better place. As the No. 2 public institution in the nation for Quality Matters certified courses, FIU achieved top placement for many of its online degree programs in the U.S. News & World Report's rankings. The rankings highlight FIU's commitment to quality and underscore the university's dedication to excellence in online learning. Page 214 of 2522021 ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN Florida International University 8 STRATEGY (cont.) Performance -Based Funding Goal Adjustments FIU made progress towards the Performance Based Metric goals assessed in the 2021 Accountability Plan. In particular, FIU's goals for metric 4 are being increased as a result of success in our ongoing efforts to increase the 4 - year graduation rate of our students. Though FIU exceeded many of its goals for the curren t cycle , there is currently insufficient data to predict if these improvements will be sustainable going forward due to the residual effects of the COVID -19 pandemic . FIU will need to gather more data before confidently setting more ambitious goals . For the new metrics (9a and 9b), we made the most reliable projections possible based on the data available. FIU is projecting to increase at a steady rate from 55% in 2019 -21 to 59% in 2023 -25 for the 2 -Year Full -Time FCS AA - Transfer Graduation Rate, as this is more in line with the changes that we observed from 2014 -16 to 2017 -19. Once further institutional initiatives are implemented that focus on improving the 2 -Year Full -Time FCS AA -Transfer Graduation Rate and the institution can estimate the impact of t hose initiatives, FIU will be able to consider more aggressive goals for future years. There exists significantly more data and mechanisms in place for 6 -Year Pell FTIC Graduation Rate. Thus, FIU is confident that we can continue to show steady year -over -year increases in this metric. Finally, FIU projects that its BOT Choice Metric (Number of Post -Doctoral Appointees) will be negatively impacted by COVID -19. Many of our postdoctoral appointees are international and their ability to work on research projec ts at FIU was hindered by COVID -19 travel restrictions . Monetary shortfalls caused by budget cutbacks, as well as the university's transition to remote learning due to COVID -19 local community conditions and the need to enforce limited occupancy for labs a nd research spaces, also affected FIU's ability to increase the number post -doctoral appointees. However, we believe this will be short term and as a result we are proposing to decrease the fall 2020 goal from 271 to 235. We will continue to grow our numbe r of post -doctoral appointees during the out years and maintain our previously set goals.

ACADEMIC AND CAREER SUCCESS 1. Redirection Specialist In November 2020, Academic and Career Success hired our first Redirection Specialist (RS) to assist with the University's progression and graduation. The University's Redirection Specialist works with students across the University who are struggling to succeed in their chosen major. He helps these students to explore alternatives, find a path towards timely graduation, and successfully process the change of major request. He also carries an advising caselo ad of approximately 71 students pursuing the Bachelor of Arts in Disaster Management. In addition, our Redirection Specialist has created training materials to assist advisors across campus with the redirection process. The training includes a presentati on highlighting the most common reasons why a student may need to be redirected a well as strategies to assist in the redirection process. He has also created a virtual redirection binder that will be accessible to the advising community. The binder includ es the change of major guidelines for all undergraduate majors, information on careers for different fields of study, and contact information for each of the colleges so that advisors can facilitate the connection between student and advisor when a student is seeking to change majors. The Redirection Specialist and the whole Student Success Operations and Strategy Team, have worked with the colleges to identify students who would benefit from redirection based on missed success markers that delay progr ess towards degree (e.g., Engineering students who have had two unsuccessful attempts at Calculus I). In collaboration with advisors in the colleges, the RS will communicate with students and meet to discuss alternative paths with the goal of finding a deg ree pathway that better suits the students' skills and interests and will allow them to graduate in a timely fashion (i.e., 4 years for FTIC and 2 years for AA transfers). 2. Panther Degree Pathway - EduNav The Panther Degree Pathway (PDP) is a guided degree plan to help students stay on track and graduate on time. Powered by EduNav's SmartPlan, PDP uses a sophisticated algorithm to generate students' personalized educational plan. PDP is a tool which students can and should use with their Academic Advisor. Academic Advisors can help in further customizing and adjusting the PDP plan at any time. The platform notifies students if any customizations or adjustments of course selections will affect the time to degree at FIU. In addition, PDP facilitates class sel ection and registration for students. Students and Advisors log in to the PDP via their MyFIU account. In the Fall 2020 semester, August 2020 through December 2020 there were 9,200 PDP Log -Ins. In the Spring 2021 semester, January through April 2021 there were 18,529 PDP Log -Ins - a 101.402% increase. Starting with the registration cycle for Summer 2021, most undergraduate majors have been configured in the Panther Degree Pathways system. In the upcoming semesters, minors and second major evaluatio ns will be added to support students who have declared minors and second majors.

Community Outreach and Events: CEO for a Day, FIU Cafecito Chats & LSSF Undergraduate STEM Symposium The Office of Engagement began multiple virtual community engagement activities immediately following community quarantine due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Between January and April 2021, the office held events engaging over 2,500 communit y members. FIU Cafecito Chats, an engagement talk show, features local and national community leaders, FIU faculty, staff and students and other local celebrities as featured guests. As of April 2021, the show had aired 154 episodes and reached over 52,00 0 people with speakers including FIU students, faculty, and staff as well as community leaders, authors, and elected officials. Cafecito Chat episodes in 2021 have featured FIU Alumni during Panther Alumni Week; FIU Theatre discussion on Women, Leadership & Healing Division with a special performance of Lysistrata; a special edition co -hosted with AT&T on Black History Month with over 700 participants; Uber's Global Head of DEI Bo Young Lee, and a conversation with Miami -Dade's Chief Bay Officer, Irela Bagu e. The eighth annual Life Sciences South Florida Undergraduate STEM Symposium was held on April 10th, 2021. There were over 130 guests, 70 STEM student presentations representing 8 educational institutions, and 54 judges evaluating student presentations. Student presentations followed the University of Queensland standard for 3MT (3 -minute thesis). Student presenters at the Symposium are top STEM majors from across 8 South Florida colleges and universities. Six prizes were awarded to the highest rate d presentations and a special keynote presentation featured Live Like Bella's CEO Raymond Rodriguez -Torres and cancer researcher and FIU faculty member, Dr. Diana Azzam. 2. Community Coalitions: South Florida Black Prosperity Alliance A direct -action reco mmendation coming from the Equity Action Advisory Group is FIU's capacity - building support of the South Florida Black Prosperity Alliance (SFBPA), which was launched by the Miami -Dade Chamber in June of 2020. The SFBPA is comprised of business, civil righ ts and economic leaders across the Tri -County, with a key focus of aligning advocacy efforts in response to the COVID -19 disproportionate impact on the South Florida Black community, and historic economic access and mobility gaps. The FIU Engagement Stra tegy and Outreach Manager is currently working in partnership with Alliance leadership and members to create an ongoing strategy and implementation plan to maximize the impact and reach of the SFBPA and its long -term efforts. The SFBPA press conferences as the official public launch of the initiative across the tri -county area on February 11, 2021 and featured FIU's Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Vice Provost of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, El pagnier Kay Hudson. 3. Future of Work: Urban Potential Laboratories (UP Labs) UP Labs started its fifth cohort of non -traditional learners on January 25, 2021. Ninety -six (96) applicants applied to 30 slots for the free workforce program focused on up -skilling underemployed residents a nd setting them up with opportunities for careers in healthcare. Two significant developments took place in January and February as our students will sit for CNA (Certified Nurse Assistant) State Board Exams after completing the UP Labs program. Another de velopment was the career pathway created with Baptist Health South Florida within their Pharmacy Technician Program. Selected students will be able to continue their education and become Pharmacy Technicians through Baptist Health. UP Labs was also able to partner with the City of North Miami to offer two modules as part of the deployment of their CARES Act funding.

University Enrollment During the spring Tribune Virtual College Fair, FIU professional staff served as featured experts in the areas of financial aid, roadblocks encountered by first generation college students, and selecting majors. We served 15,000 students via FIU's virtual booth; we engaged in video presentations and one-on-one virtual appointments. During the spring term, we also met with 515 new students and 700 family members via a socially distanced, on -campus Admitted Students Day. Through this event, we focused on developing institutional affinity within our new FTIC and undergraduate transferring students. The admitted student day events included a car caravan, opportunities to meet with President Rosenberg , and many pictures taken with Roary. After parking their cars, students and families participated in a campus tour/scavenger hunt guided by a GPS enabled ap p. We hosted a similar event at BBC on April 17th and a virtual Admitted Student day on April 24th. Table 1 Spring Point in Time Headcount comparison (End of Term PIT) Student Classification Spring 2020 Spring 2021 Diff. % Diff. Degree 55,949 -631 -1.12% 2. International Admissions We are ahead in applied, admitted, and matriculated international students for AY 2021 -2022 (see table 2). For the upcoming year, we received more applications from prospective FTIC and Graduate students. Although we received slighter fewer undergraduate transfer applications (when compared to last year), we are ahead in admitted transferring international students by more than 20%. We anticipate that incoming stude nts will encounter substantial roadblocks as they attempt to obtain visas; therefore, we will continue to support international students via online coursework while deferring I -20 entry terms. Table 2 International Applications by Status and Academic Year ( as of 04/23/2021 ) 434 71 19.56% Matriculated 27 32.53% Undergraduate Transfer Graduate Applied -17 242 663 421 173.97% Page 244 of 252Florida International University Board of Tr ustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 5 3. Transfer and Transition Services Connect4Success On April 1st, our team hosted the annual BC -FIU day as a virtual event. During the event, faculty, administrators, and advisors from BC2FIU Helios Scholarship programs discussed strategies to recruit and engage Associate in Science students to the four established pa thways more effectively. Through this event, we developed several collaborative strategies that we will implement in the upcoming recruitment cycle. In collaboration with Miami Dade College and FIU's College of Business, on March 31st the C4S team facilitated a virtual information session for FIU -bound students. We provided 263 MDC students with information concerning application deadlines, program prerequisites, degree requirements, and alternative pathways. During the second half of the ev ent, a panel of FIU students who transferred from MDC shared insights from the lived experiences during their transitions to our College of Business. Our level of participation constituted a record for the count of student participants. Note: The number of students who joined Connect4Success in the 2020 -21 academic year reached 1,923, surpassing the 2019 -20 cohort of 1,851. Brainware for Transcripts (BFT) Strategic Initiative In March 2021, we launched the Brainware Optical Character Recognition softw are. We are finishing the process of modifying business processes and position expectations to optimize the use of this new technology. Over the next year, we will be evaluating the implementation phase of this project via the number of days required to p rocess incoming transfer credits (as opposed to weeks) and the accuracy of our credit equivalencies. 4. Financial Aid Disbursement As of April 21st, we delivered $221 million in aid for the Spring 2021 semester. At this time last year, we awarded $208.8 million. The large increase for point in time reflects our awarding of the CRRSAA (HEERF II) funds to students. Details will follow in the Scholarship Office section. Draft 3 Year Cohort Default Rate Our Draft Cohort Default rate for 2018 is 4.5%. The final rate will be published in September 2021 and is usually similar to the draft rate. Our continued downward trend is reflective of our continued efforts in financial education and direct outreach to FIU students who borrow. Page 245 of 252Florida International University Board of Tr ustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 6 5. Scholarships Merit Scholarships For the 2021 -2022 academic year, we are focusing on improving the quality and diversity of our merit aid program while mitigating the impact of COVID -19 on our students. For the Fall 2021 class, we have committed 5 national merit finalists (this is one more than we had at this time for Fall 2020). We updated our College Board Recognition Scholarships regimen and offered our first set of College Board S cholar Scholarships to 29 students; scholarship recipients include 22 College Board Hispanic Scholars, 6 College Board African American Scholars, and 1 College Board Rural Scholar. Through our top 10% pathway to scholarship consideration, we have increased the diversity of our premier merit scholarship offers; we increased the number of black students that we awarded our largest awards from 18 (in 2020) to 25 in 2021. We are working to yield these students and continue our work to improve access. Beyond Fi nancial Aid In partnership with Academic and Student Affairs, we will be leading the University through the Beyond Financial Aid Framework. As created by the Lumina Foundation, Beyond Financial Aid is a compendium of best practices for assisting low -income students. This toolkit includes five concrete strategies we can use determine how, and how well, we are serving low -income students. In this framework, we will devise and implement plans to improve, expand and better coordinate services for greater impac t. Holistic student support for students facing financial distress has become increasingly important over the past year and a half. To provide student -centered and intentional experiences, we rely on a holist, cross -institutional strategy. Through this s trategy, we leverage existing resources to proactively contact students who may be encountering barriers to enrollment and provide \"just in time\" support for students in the midst of financial difficulty. This strategy capitalizes on the Enrollment Manage ment's capacity to eliminate process -based barriers and Student Affairs focus on providing high-touch support. To date, we provided $900,000 to students who encountered non -COVID, financial challenges. Page 246 of 252Florida International University Board of Tr ustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 7 Covid -19 Impact The Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds (HEERF) are a vital part of our student support effort post-pandemic. Although regulations pertaining to use of HEERF funds prohibit us from using funds to incentivize enrollment directly, we employ communication and follow up strategies to make sur e eligible students receive the funds needed to enroll. Since the pandemic began, we have awarded $41 million in student relief to over 26,000 students. HEERF I (CARES) recipient data illustrates that these funds have been essential in supporting students through the pandemic. Some highlights: .53% (n=51) of CARES Act recipients withdrew completely 29%(n=2,842) of CARES Act recipients completed programs by Fall 2020 75% (n=7,301) of students were still enrolled* as of Fall 2020. *includ es undergrads who graduated spring/summer and started grad school or other courses in Fall 2020. We are analyz ing this data further, along with that from HEERF 2 recipients, to see what we can learn to maximize impact of HEERF 3 and to determine impacts on cohort progression. As we await guidance on HEERF 3, we will be working with External Relations and the HEERF Committee to update marketing materials and messaging to students to raise awareness of eligibility and how funds can be app lied. 6. University Registrar Added features to the Employee Activity Guide On February 2nd, the University Registrar's office initiated new automation to ensure that all employees who have access to our student information system engage in annual FERPA training and sign FERPA -based terms of system usage. Specifically, our new system ensures that employees review and agree to: a. The Family Education Rights and Privacy ACT (FERPA) agreement b. FIU's Code of Computing Practice c. The Gramm -Leach -Bliley ACT (GLBA) Enhanced privacy for students and their records On February 19th, the University changed se veral aspects of the official transcript. To enhance services and privacy for students, we partially masked SSN, partially masked DOB, and removed the gender reference. Additionally, on February 2nd, we enhanced the student port by introducing a simplified method for reporting SSN and masking SSN as the default setting. This enhancement includes the following: a. Removal of SSN from personal details tab (student profile ti le) b. New SSN -specific tab which includes appropriate institutional use of SSN c. SSN data entry screen for students (precludes the need to contact OneStop to add SSN to student information) d. Data quality and validation measures Page 247 of 252Florida International University Board of Tr ustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 8 Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) Credits for Undergraduate graduation We actively worked with the Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health Sciences to create a new and streamlined process to post Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) credits to student transcripts; this will facilitate a more efficient graduation process for Undergraduate Nursing students. Licensed RN's with an associate degree in nursing ( ADN) from an ACEN accredited institution, who meet certain criteria can earn up to 27 PLA credits towards the completion of the BSN at FIU. In Fall of 2020, we graduated 11 students with their BSN using this accelerated mechanism. We launched a similar PLA process for the BA in Disaster Management Program. In collaboration with the department, we created a variable credit course, FES 3951, to provide up to 30 P LA credits for Undergraduate Disaster Management students. 7. OneStop One Stop has reopened the front counter as a point of service during repopulation of the campus. During the Spring 2021 peak time, students slowly returned to receive service in person at the front counter. As indicated in the chart below, during the month of January 2021 343 students visited the One Stop in person. As we approach the beginning of the Summer semester, we continue to schedule staff to meet the needs of our students, the majority of whom continue to access our services via phone, email, and live chat. One Stop student in -person visits Month Avg. daily Avg. weekly Highest daily Highest weekly Total monthly October 2020 4.7 22 13 37 109 November 2020 6.4 34 15 39 134 December 2020 7.2 31 13 45 123 Jan 2021 17.2 86 39 131 343 *MMC & BBC figures combined due to low volume at BBC resulting in negligible values for averages Students contact One Stop via phone, email, or chat 9AM -8PM, Monday through Thursday, and 9AM - 6PM on Fridays. As a result of our extended service hours, stude nts are able to speak to a representative. There has been a significant reduction in call volume over the past three years, due to increased efficiency in the number of forms that can now be processed electronically, without the need for students to bring forms to our office in person. 8. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Update On April 14th, we launched the May 1st FTIC yield campaign. Our communication efforts yielded an open rate of 48% and a click through rate of 5%; these rates are well above industry standards. We also sent a communication to Title I students that have not submitted a tuition deposit with inst ructions on next steps such as requesting for a deposit waiver, completing FAFSA, and encouraging them to join a Campus Tour. On April 13, 2021, we kicked -off the 2021 Search Piece campaign to High Ability 11th grade students to recruit for class of 2022 . As of April 21, 2021, 4,100 students opened the communication and will receive a personalized postcard from the University Admissions office. Page 248 of 252Florida International University Board of Tr ustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 9 Lastly, we added a Request for More Information form to the Self -Guided tour that admissions will be using for students who decide to come on campus and do a tour on their own. This Self -Guided tour will collect information so that recruiters can reach out and get to know potential FIU applicants. IV. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REPORT 1. Q-Factor High -Speed Data Transfer Project The Division of IT's Center for Internet Augmented Research and Assessment (CIARA) and Energy Science Network (ESnet) have been awarded a two -year National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure res earch grant for Q -Factor. Q -Factor is a framework that enables high-speed data transfer optimization. This concept, developed by CIARA and ESnet, will help automate the data transfer speed between computers and end points. Q -Factor will enhance inter - campu s data transfers performed over regional, national, and international networks to support the growing trend towards data -intensive research. CIARA and ESnet will research, prototype, and deploy the new Q -Factor technology. 2. Enterprise -Wide Cloud Strate gy Update The Division of IT continues to leverage cloud technology to uplift core enterprise applications such as Panthersoft Campus Solutions, Human Resources, and Financials to enhance the ability to accelerate production with autonomous technologies. Over the past eight months, the division has been working to migrate all of FIU's PeopleSoft applications to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This strategic move to the cloud will allow for greater scalability to meet the University's growing needs, higher service availability, and will protect FIU services from natural disasters. Panthersoft is only one of many transitions to a cloud -based infrastructure that will take place over the next year. The Panthersoft applications are tentatively set to be m igrated during the Fall of 2021. To date, other applications such as email and authentication have been transitioned to the cloud. 3. Enterprise -Wide CRM The Division of IT is driving efforts to standardize on one customer relationship management (CRM) tool to be used university -wide. This is a multi -phased approach that will evaluate academic and business units individually, starting with the College of Business. The division is providing project management services to assist the College of Business and the vendor with the implementation, consultations on hiring project resources with the appropriate skillsets, and provide data management and governance best practices to support this implementation. This strategy is intended to centralize university data and track student progress from their initial interactions at FIU through graduation. V. RESEARCH AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT / UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOL 1. External Grant Awards' Performance During the first nine months of fiscal year (FY) 2020 -2021, awards received increased by 63%, from $120.8M to $196.3M, when compared with the same period last year. Awards received by Centers and Institutes increased by 10%, from $57.9M to $63.7M. Notable initial awards includ e $3.39M from the National Institute on Aging for a project titled Gene Deregulation in Cortical Dementia. Among colleges, the Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work had the largest increase (127%), followed by the Steven J. Green School of Interna tional and Public Affairs (97%). The Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine had a decline of 22%, and the College of Engineering & Computing had a decline of 15%. During the past 9 months, the overall value of proposals submitted increased Page 249 of 252Florida International University Board of Tr ustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Reports P. 10 by 16%, from $557M to $646M; the number of proposals submitted increased by 14%, from 828 to 944. The distribution among funding sources (federal, private, state and local) during this period was 85%, 5% and 10%, respectively. 2. Innovation, Partnerships and Economic Deve lopment The research commercialization staff had a net increase of three teams during the third quarter. One team submitted an NSF PFI grant proposal and a national I -Corps application. Two teams completed a regional NSF I -Corps to qualify for national I -Corps. StartUP FIU staff developed and presented three virtual workshops on commercializing research in which 78 faculty participated. In the Venture Bites college student entrepreneurship competition hosted by Miami Angels and the City of Miami, nine (9) students from StartUP FIU moved to the second round of competition (out of 17 total students who reached this stage). These students al l had been through at least one of StartUP FIU's sprint - style boot camps prior to the competition and went through weekly sessions with StartUP FIU staff to prepare for each round of the competition. In the end, out of five finalists, two of them were Star tUP FIU student companies, and College Thrifts created by FIU's Patricia Garcia won! The other FIU student company, Amber Nolan's Planet Paws, came in fourth place. College Thrifts received $5,000 and Planet Paws received $1,500. Both students will receive free mentorship from Miami -based entrepreneurship organizations. It is noteworthy that FIU was only university with female -led founders. In addition, three teams continued their weekly preparation at StartUP FIU for the 2021 Hult Prize regional competit ions in April. This quarter, 20 students applied and 18 were accepted to Beta Studio Cohort 2 prototype incubator. StartUP FIU initiated \" Building a Technical Career\" with Google and Dr. Jennifer Gebelein from CASE for 20 students to prepare them to secure internships at Google. StartUP FIU Food secured a $400,000 grant from the Kellogg Foundation in December of 2020. This funding will allow the development of an online platform that supports and accelerates minority and woman -owned food and beverage busine sses with aspirations to expand online. During the third quarter, the Technology Transfer group received 14 disclosures, filed 23 patent applications, received 30 patents and entered into 4 license agreements. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez presented via zoom to a group of faculty and postdocs on intellectual property \u2014things to know and pitfalls. 3. University Graduate School (UGS) As of March 30, UGS received 2,624 applications for doctoral programs, a 37.6% increase when compared to last year. Both domestic and internati onal applications increased (20% and 70%, respectively). Thus far, we have admitted 425 doctoral students, an 89.7% increase compared to last year. The application deadline for masters' program is June 1, and UGS has so far received 5,482 applications, a 3 7.5% increase compared to last year. We have admitted 1694 masters' students, a 47.9% increase compared to last year. This spring semester UGS has been developing a new series of interactive workshops that will be part of the soon -to-be-launched Writing L ab under UGS' Office of Training and Fellowships (OTF). UGS facilitated various workshops that were very well attended and for which we received overwhelmingly positive feedback. Five (5) current FIU doctoral students have been awarded the prestigious National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRF).The fellowship provides full financial support for 3 years and important networking opportunities.

LGBTQA Initiatives Rebranded to the Pride Center On April 2, 2021, LGBTQA Initiatives in the Office of Social Justice and Inclusion (OSJI) was rebranded to the Pride Center at FIU. The Pride Center name change reflects the unit's mission and programs that seek to uplift and include the voices of all students with marginalized gender identities, sexual identities, and romantic identities and their allies with a special emphasis on centering students w hose identities intersect with additional experiences of marginalization (e.g., due to racism, colorism, ableism, and more). \"Pride\" echoes the terminology that students connected to the office resonate with and desire to represent them. The Pride Center is committed to FIU's values and diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Overall, through the Pride Center's focus on growth, inclusion, kindness, openness, affirmation, celebration, and empowerment, this name change better r epresents the framing of the office's efforts and our FIU.
