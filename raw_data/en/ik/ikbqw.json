What Is Naturopathic Medicine? Naturopathic medicine is a system of health care that generally includes naturopaths who are trained in diagnosing conditions by taking the patient's symptoms into account as well as their personal history. They use treatments such as dietary changes or nutritional supplements (herbs) for treating ailments like arthritis and depression. The History of Naturopathic Medicine? Naturopathic medicine was established by Benedict Lust in 17th century Sweden. He believed that different natural substances and remedies were the best way to heal patients suffering from chronic ailments because they are more compatible with the human body than medicines made of chemicals. These early naturopaths relied on treatments such as hot baths, cold showers, fresh air, etc. Over time, naturopathic medicine has evolved into what medical practitioners are implementing today. They still use natural remedies, but they also have the ability to prescribe medications that are more potent. Naturopathic doctors can now diagnose and treat a variety of illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, etc. How is Naturopathic Medicine Used? Believe it or not, but naturopathic medicine is far more evolved than what many critics have described as pseudoscience. This form of medicinal treatment is actually much more structured and procedural. It includes acupuncture, herbal remedies, and massage therapy. Naturopathic medicine is a type of natural healing that combines both traditional Chinese and Western medical practices to create a fully personalized treatment plan for each patient based on their specific needs. What are the Benefits of Naturopathic Medicine? Naturopathic medicine is a safe and effective form of treatment that can be used to address an array of medical concerns. Unlike traditional Western treatments which rely on prescription medication, naturopathic physicians are trained in the use of natural remedies and other alternative methods. This includes acupuncture, herbal remedies, massage therapy, and detoxification. The benefits of naturopathic medicine include: - It is a natural form of treatment that relies on holistic care, which can be very effective in treating chronic conditions. - Patients are able to play an active role in their own healing process and create a personalized plan with the naturopath. This also ensures that they will have access to all possible treatments. - In some cases, naturopathic medicine is safer than traditional forms of treatment for chronic diseases. What are the Disadvantages of Naturopathic Medicine? Not all forms of medicine are right for everything, this includes everything from chemotherapy to integrative medicine. If you are considering this form of treatment, it's important that you familiarize yourself with all of the disadvantages of naturopathic medicine, which include: - The naturopath's training may not be accredited and can use some unproven forms of medicine. - You might have to find a doctor that is in your area, as they are few and far between. - Treatment methods vary from physician to physician so you need to make sure it matches what works for you. As you can see, there are certain caveats when choosing to experiment with naturopathic medicine. Make sure you consult with your primary doctor to decide whether or not this mode of treatment is right for you. Is Naturopathic Medicine Effective? Naturopathic medicine is an alternative form of treatment that has been practiced for millennia. The earliest records of naturopathy date back to ancient Greece in the second century, where it was noted as a way to treat those with mental health issues and chronic diseases such as diabetes, Mellitus, or cardiovascular disorders. Many studies have proven that naturopathic medicine has actually been effective when treating minor and chronic illnesses. The most common naturopathic treatments are herbal therapies, homeopathic remedies, and other natural methods. However, there are a number of options; for example, yoga therapy and acupuncture can also be used to treat various illnesses. Some more serious diseases such as cancer have proven not quite as effective when using naturopathy treatment modalities. These diseases are best combated with more aggressive treatment methods. Ultimately, naturopathic medicine is an effective form of treatment. It's best to consult with your doctor to understand its impact and benefits regarding your own condition, as well as a cost-benefit analysis. Should You Consider Naturopathic Medicine? Naturopathic medicine is a type of alternative treatment that may be prescribed for those who are seeking holistic healing. Some people choose naturopathic treatments because they have been told by their doctors to avoid conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation, due to the risks of side effects or other medical conditions. Others might try it as an alternative form of medicine when they want to avoid the dread and pain of more aggressive medicinal techniques. In either case, there is no simple answer to the question of whether or not this treatment is right for you. That will be a decision you will have to make with the help of a certified medical professional. Conclusion There are many different forms of medicine, both scientific and natural. All of which have been effective in treating various health issues since the dawn of time. Naturopathic medicine is an example of natural, holistic treatment that can serve as an alternative method for those who want to avoid conventional treatment for whatever reason. Discussing the pros and cons of this treatment is best done with a doctor that can guide you to a specialist that provides this level of care. "}
