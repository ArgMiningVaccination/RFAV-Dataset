Accordingly, various cholinergic drugs have been approved to treat AD, and they exert their therapeutic effects by counteracting acetylcholine (ACh) deficits and consequently enhancing the ACh levels in the brain [ [3](#B3-kjpp-16-79)]. [4](#B4-kjpp-16-79)]. Because such lesions in cholinergic neuronal circuits result in decreased ACh release and subsequent dysfunction in learning and memory, the SCO-induced amnesic model has been widely used to provide a model system of memory dysfunction to screen for pharmacological agents with memory-enhancing activities [ [5](#B5-kjpp-16-79)]. [6](#B6-kjpp-16-79)]. These inflammatory cytokines may play a role as neurotoxic agents in the pathological cascade of AD [ [7](#B7-kjpp-16-79)]. [8](#B8-kjpp-16-79), [9](#B9-kjpp-16-79)]. However, there has been little scientific evidence reported regarding their effectiveness or mechanisms of their action. [10](#B10-kjpp-16-79)]. PA and its major alkaloid compound, berberine (BER), have multiple pharmacological actions and produce a variety of biological effects in the CNS [ [11](#B11-kjpp-16-79)]. In particular, BER has been reported to improve diabetes-induced memory impairment and to reduce oxidative stress [ [12](#B12-kjpp-16-79)]. Several studies have shown that BER was effective in ameliorating spatial memory impairment and decreasing the expression of IL-1 in a rat model of AD [ [13](#B13-kjpp-16-79)], suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects of PA and BER may result from their ability to inhibit the degeneration of cholinergic neurons, thereby alleviating deficits in spatial learning ability in the memory-impairment animal model [ [14](#B14-kjpp-16-79)]. METHODS Animals Main reagent [15](#B15-kjpp-16-79)]. One hundred grams of PA were cut into small pieces and extracted three times with 4 l of 85% methanol by sonication in a reflux condenser for 24 h at room temperature (25\u00b12). The extracted solutions were combined, filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper, concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator (EYELA CCA-1110, Tokyo Rikakikai Co., Tokyo, Japan) to obtain concentrated extracts, and then lyophilized (EYELA FD-800). The final yield of PA in a powder form was 13.7% (w/w). Experimental groups [Fig. 1](#F1-kjpp-16-79). Passive avoidance test [16](#B16-kjpp-16-79)]. The Gemini Avoidance System (SD Instruments., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for this experiment. Basically, the step-through passive avoidance apparatus consists of a two-compartment acrylic box with a lightened compartment connected to a darkened one by an automatic guillotine door. Electric shock was delivered to the grid floor of both compartment, made of stainless steel rods (3 mm diameter) spaced 1 cm apart, by an isolated shock generator (Behbood Pardaz Co., Ghaem, Iran). First, rats were taken trials to acquisition test in the apparatus. In this trial, rats were placed in a lightened compartment for 300 s, and then the guillotine door was opened. Rats have native preference to the dark environment. Immediately upon entering the dark compartment, the door was closed. Acquisition test was recorded the latencies times for entering the dark compartment. After 30 min, rats were again placed in the lightened compartment. Rats had spontaneously entered the dark compartment, the guillotine door was closed and a mild electrical shock (0.5 mA) was applied for 3 s. Exactly 24 h after the acquisition trial for training, the retention test was performed. The rat was again placed in the lightened compartment and the guillotine door was opened. The retention test was measured the latencies times for entering the dark compartment in a same method with acquisition test. The maximum entry latency allowed in the retention test was 180 s [ [17](#B17-kjpp-16-79)]. Morris water maze test 1. Morris water maze apparatus 2. Hidden platform trial for acquisition test 3. Probe trial for retention test Cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) and Acethylcholinesterase (AchE) immunohistochemistry [18](#B18-kjpp-16-79)]. The cells were counted in three sections per rat within the hippocampal area. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) in plasma [19](#B19-kjpp-16-79)] with BSA as the standard. The IL-1 and IL-6 concentration was measured by a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) using a rabbit polyclonal IL-1 and IL-6 antibody (IL-1 and IL-6; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples (or standard) and conjugate were added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature without blocking. After wells were washed several times with buffers and proper color developed, the optical density was measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader (MutiRead 400; Authos Co., Vienna, Austria). Total RNA preparation and RT-PCR analysis Statistical analysis RESULTS Effect of PA and its main alkaloid compound, BER on the passive avoidance test [Fig. 2](#F2-kjpp-16-79)). The rats in all groups were confirmed to have no physiological defect (i.e., motor function defect) or intrinsic cognitive impairment prior to SCO-induced impairments established through acquisition trials without electric challenge in the PAT. No significant difference was found between the groups in the time required for acquisition trials, as indicated by the latencies for entering the dark compartment. After acquisition, the effect of PA or BER on retention latency, indicated by the latency times for entering the dark compartment, was measured 24 hours after applying electric shock in the dark room in the PAT. Regarding retention, rats in the SCO+BER20 group (p<0.05) and the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.01) were shown to have significantly increased latencies for entering the dark compartment compared with the SCO group. This study indicates that SCO injection severely impaired long-term memory, while the PA and BER treatment significantly attenuated the SCO-induced memory deficit in the PAT test. It also indicated that the recovery of memory impairment of rats in the 200 mg/kg PA-treated group was better than those rats in the 20 mg/kg BER-treated group, and almost compatible with the rats in the 0.2 mg/kg TA-treated group. Effect of PA and its main alkaloid compound, BER on the water maze test [Fig. 3](#F3-kjpp-16-79). The SAL group rapidly learned the location of the submerged hidden platform and reached it within 20 s on day 5 of the trials. The SCO group showed a marked retardation in escape latency, probably due to memory deficits resulting from SCO-induced impairment of learning and memory. Analysis of escape latency revealed that rats in both the SCO+BER20 group and the SCO+PA200 group had significantly reduced swimming latency as compared with those in the SCO group (SCO+BER20 group: p<0.05 on day 4 and 5, and SCO+PA200 group: p<0.05 on day 3, p<0.01 on day 4 and 5; [Fig. 3A](#F3-kjpp-16-79)). To examine the spatial memory of rats, the performance in the probe trial on day 6 was analyzed by comparing the percentage of time spent swimming to the expected position of platform ( [Fig. 3B](#F3-kjpp-16-79)). The times spent swimming around was significantly reduced in the rats that swam to the target area where the platform had been located. The repeated administration of SCO severely impaired spatial performance in the MWM test (p<0.01). Rats in the 20 mg/kg BER-treated (p<0.05) group and the 200 mg/kg PA-treated (p<0.01) group spent more time around the platform area than did those in the SCO group. The SCO group was not significantly different from other groups in terms of mean swimming speed, as calculated by dividing the total swim distance by the latency ( [Fig. 3C](#F3-kjpp-16-79)). Total distance traveled in each group was closely associated with escape latency in this task (data not shown). Based on these results, the 20 mg/kg of BER-treated and 200 mg/kg of PA-treated rats showed greater improvements in acquisition during the hidden platform trial and reached the platform quicker than the SCO-treated rats. PA and BER treatment significantly attenuated the SCO-induced deficit of learning and memory demonstrated in the water maze. Thus, PA-treated rats and BER-treated rats showed a significant amelioration in the memory retention test because they spent more time in the quadrant where the platform was formerly located and swam over the former location of the platform more frequently. It also indicated that the swimming latency of spatial memory impairment in rats receiving 200 mg/kg PA administration was better than those rats receiving 20 mg/kg BER administration, and almost compatible with the rats receiving 0.2 mg/kg TA administration. Effect of PA and its main alkaloid compound, BER on septo-hippocampal choline acetyltransferase [Fig. 4](#F4-kjpp-16-79). The brains of the SCO group showed significant neurons loss in the medical septum and hippocampal regions of septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurons, as compared to the SAL group (p<0.001; [Fig. 5A](#F5-kjpp-16-79)). The number of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons significantly increased in the medical septum region in the SCO+BER20 group (p<0.01) and the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.01), as compared to the SCO group. Also, the number of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons significantly increased in hippocampal region in the SCO+BER20 group (p<0.05) and the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.05), as compared to the SCO group. Losses of ChAT-immunoreactivity in SCO-induced memory impairment rats were significantly restored by the PA and BER administration, and the number of ChAT-immunopositive neurons was closely similar to that of the control group. It also indicated that the ChAT activity in the septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurons in rats receiving 200 mg/kg PA administration was better than those rats receiving 20 mg/kg BER administration, and almost compatible with the rats receiving 0.2 mg/kg TA administration. Effect of PA and its main alkaloid compound, BER on hippocampal acetylcholinesterase [Fig. CA3 area of hippocampus due to SCO-induced memory impairment was significantly restored in the SCO+BER20 group (p<0.05) and the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.05), as compared to the SCO group. The effect of PA and BER on the density of AchE reactive neurons in hippocampus CA3 region was similar to that in the CA1 region. It also indicated that the density of AchE-reactive neurons in the hippocampus in rats receiving 200 mg/kg PA administration was better than those rats receiving 20 mg/kg BER administration, and almost compatible with the rats receiving 0.2 mg/kg TA administration. Effect of PA and its main alkaloid compound, BER on the IL-1 and IL-6 protein expression in the plasma [Fig. 6A](#F6-kjpp-16-79)). The expression of IL-1 protein in the plasma due to SCO-induced memory impairment was significantly restored in the SCO+BER20 group (p<0.05) and the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.05), as compared to SCO group. The expression of IL-6 protein in the plasma was also markedly increased in the SCO group, as compared to the SAL group (p<0.05; [Fig. 6B](#F6-kjpp-16-79)). The expression of IL-6 protein in the plasma due to SCO-induced memory impairment was significantly restored in the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.05), as compared to SCO group. It also indicated that the expression of IL-1 and IL-6 proteins in the plasma in rats receiving 200 mg/kg PA administration was better than those rats receiving 20 mg/kg BER administration, and almost compatible with the rats receiving 0.2 mg/kg TA administration. Effect of PA and its main alkaloid compound, BER on BDNF, CREB, IL-1, and CREB mRNA expression in the SCO group were significantly decreased as compared to that of the SAL group (p<0.01). The decreased expression of BDNF and CREB mRNA in the SCO group was significantly restored in the SCO+BER20 group (p<0.05) and the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.01). It also indicated that the expression of BDNF and CREB mRNA in the hippocampus in rats receiving 200 mg/kg PA administration was better than those rats receiving 20 mg/kg BER administration, and almost compatible with the rats receiving 0.2 mg/kg TA administration. Hippocampal IL-1 and TNF- mRNA expression in the SCO group was significantly increased as compared to that of the SAL group (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). The increased expression of IL-1 mRNA in the SCO group was significantly restored in the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.05). The increased expression of TNF- mRNA in the SCO group was also significantly restored in the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.01). It also indicated that the expression of IL-1 and TNF- mRNA in the hippocampus in rats receiving 200 mg/kg PA administration was better than those rats receiving 20 mg/kg BER administration, and almost compatible with the rats receiving 0.2 mg/kg TA administration. Hippocampal COX-2 mRNA expression in the SCO group were also significantly increased as compared to that of the SAL group (p<0.01). The increased expression of COX-2 mRNA in the SCO group was significantly restored in the SCO+PA100 group (p<0.05) and the SCO+PA200 group (p<0.05). It also indicated that the expression of COX-2 mRNA in the hippocampus in rats receiving 200 mg/kg PA administration was almost compatible with the rats receiving 0.2 mg/kg TA administration. DISCUSSION [20](#B20-kjpp-16-79)]. Although typical prescriptions including PA are known to be clinically effective in alleviating memory-related symptoms, the underlying mechanisms of PA in those effects have not been investigated. A major component of PA is BER, which could potentially possess anti-AD effects [ [21](#B21-kjpp-16-79)]. Recently, some studies demonstrated that BER could inhibit the expression of some inflammatory factors through the nuclear factor-B (NF-B) signaling pathway [ [22](#B22-kjpp-16-79)]. Also, BER can penetrate the blood-brain barrier to reach the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus, and thus, BER might act directly in brain nuclei to produce neuroprotective effects [ [11](#B11-kjpp-16-79)]. However, our results are not consistent with the previous studies showing that BER could inhibit memory impairment and expression of the inflammatory factor interleukin-1 by increasing microglial activation [ [13](#B13-kjpp-16-79)]. The difference between our results and those of previous studies may result from differing effects of BER on immune and inflammatory factor expression in different animal modes of Alzheimer's disease. [3](#B3-kjpp-16-79)]. The well-replicated amnesic effect of SCO has been interpreted as a principal consequence of the blockade of post-synaptic muscarinic M1 transmission, leading to disruption in the functioning of the hippocampus in working memory. Thus, the SCO-induced amnesic model has been widely used as a pharmacological model of memory dysfunction in screening for agents with potential cognition-enhancing effects [ [4](#B4-kjpp-16-79)]. [23](#B23-kjpp-16-79)]. Animals encode spatial working information during the learning step, which then serves to guide future memory retrieval. The current finding that the memory deficits demonstrated by the SCO-impaired rats in the MWM task were more pronounced than were those in the SAL group were consistent with a previous study [ [24](#B24-kjpp-16-79)]. During the trial sessions, the PA and BER groups showed significantly reduced escape latency, enhanced cognitive performance, and amelioration of the memory deficits associated with SCO. In terms of average swim speeds and rest times, both indices of motor functioning, the SCO group did not differ significantly from the PA-treated and BER-treated groups, suggesting that motor impairment was not the primary cause of the poor performance of the SCO group in the MWM test. Thus, it is evident that PA and BER administration improved MWM performance by directly enhancing spatial working memory. Scores on the escape and the spatial probe tests of the MWM test are considered to primarily reflect long-term spatial memory ability. In this study, PA and BER treatment shortened the escape latency without affecting swimming velocity and extended the time spent swimming in the place where the platform was previously located. In the probe test, administration of PA and BER lowered the escape latency to levels comparable to those demonstrated by the control group and significantly increased the number of times that the rats crossed the platform location [ [25](#B25-kjpp-16-79)]. [23](#B23-kjpp-16-79), [26](#B26-kjpp-16-79)]. It seems likely that the central cholinergic neuronal system plays an important role in learning acquisition and synaptic plasticity [ [27](#B27-kjpp-16-79)]. The expression and activation of AchE and ChAT regulate the dynamic concentration of ACh in the cholinergic synapses in the brain [ [28](#B28-kjpp-16-79)]. PA and BER improved cholinergic neurons in the hippocampus and continuously induced increases in ChAT and AchE activities, which eventually resulted in recovery of the entire cholinergic circulation pathway [ [29](#B29-kjpp-16-79)]. According to the cholinergic hypothesis, memory impairment in patients with senile dementia is due to selective and irreversible deficits in cholinergic function or alternation in hippocampal functioning in the brain [ [29](#B29-kjpp-16-79)]. Thus, cholinesterase inhibitors and ChAT activators may compensate for reduced the ACh levels in brains with AD disease. Previous biochemical and behavioral evidence indicated that central cholinergic transmission declines as a result of SCO administration [ [30](#B30-kjpp-16-79)] and the type of dementia associated with AD [ [31](#B31-kjpp-16-79)]. This type of decline has been closely associated with cognitive disturbances. It seems likely that the observed amelioration in the deficits in spatial learning capability demonstrated in the PA-treated and BER-treated rats were associated with the increased release of ACh. Thus, we propose that the beneficial effects of PA and its major alkaloid compound, BER, to ameliorate memory impairments could be related to increase central cholinergic functioning. [32](#B32-kjpp-16-79)]. The intentional expression of BDNF and CREB proteins in the brain provides a novel treatment strategy for healing memory deficits [ [33](#B33-kjpp-16-79)]. Recent experimental evidence strongly supports the role of BDNF in the modulation of synaptic function and plasticity in CNS for learning and memory processes, besides its actions on neuronal cell survival and prevention of neurodegeneration [ [33](#B33-kjpp-16-79)]. Also, there is sufficient evidence that the CREB regulates the expression of genes involved in neuroplasticity, cell survival, and cognition [ [34](#B34-kjpp-16-79)]. The phosphorylated CREBs are able to bind to cAMP response elements of the target genes considered to be involved in long-term memory formation [ [35](#B35-kjpp-16-79)]. Thus, BDNF transcription, regulated by CREB, may also be a critical player in the adaptive neuronal responses underlying learning and memory function [ [36](#B36-kjpp-16-79)]. Thus, a previous study suggested a close correlation between reduced expression of BDNF and CREB in the hippocampus and cognitive impairment [ [37](#B37-kjpp-16-79)]. SCO-induced memory deficits induced significant reductions of the BDNF and CREB mRNA expression in the hippocampus and poor performance in the hippocampus-dependent tasks [ [38](#B38-kjpp-16-79), [39](#B39-kjpp-16-79)]. We thus proposed that administration of PA and BER significantly prevented the reduction of the BDNF and CREB mRNA expression induced by SCO. These findings suggested that the beneficial effects of PA and BER reduces SCO-induced memory and learning deficits by the increase in BDNF expression via the CREB signaling pathway and could be related to increase in neuronal functioning. [40](#B40-kjpp-16-79)] and that these cytokines may play a role in several events in the pathological cascade of AD [ [41](#B41-kjpp-16-79)]. These results suggest that inflammatory reactions may be related to the pathogenesis of degenerative changes and cognitive impairment [ [42](#B42-kjpp-16-79)]. In the present study, SCO administration caused an increase in the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF- as well as learning and memory deficits. PA and BER inhibited the increased activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF- in SCO-treated rats. [43](#B43-kjpp-16-79)]. It is known that the expression of COX-2 and the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), one of its products, are increased in the hippocampus of AD patients, which may be related to the pathogenesis of the degenerative changes and cognitive impairments [ [44](#B44-kjpp-16-79)]. These results suggest that inflammatory responses to SCO injection significantly stimulated the expression of COX-2 mRNA in the hippocampus through modulating the NF-B pathway [ [45](#B45-kjpp-16-79)]. The increase in COX-2 expression by NF-B activation can accelerate inflammatory responses and subsequently contribute to learning and memory deficits. Thus, treatment with long-lasting COX-2 inhibitors during the initial stages of AD, before clinical symptoms of dementia appear, may suppress inflammatory responses and the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators in the brain [ [46](#B46-kjpp-16-79)]. In the present study, PA significantly decreased SCO-stimulated behavioral changes and memory disturbances through inhibition of COX-2 mRNA expression. Thus, we proposed that the anti-inflammatory effects of PA and BER significantly reversed impairment in spatial working memory. "}
