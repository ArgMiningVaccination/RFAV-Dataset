One reason is that distribution varies by state and territory. And scammers, always at the ready, are taking advantage of the confusion. Besides a big dose of patience, here are some tips to help you avoid a vaccine-related scam, no matter where you live: - Contact a trusted source for information. Check with [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html)or [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory)health departments to learn when and how to get the COVID-19 vaccine. You can also talk with your health care provider or pharmacist. - Don't pay to sign up for the vaccine. Anyone who asks for a payment to put you on a list, make an appointment for you, or reserve a spot in line is a scammer. - Ignore sales ads for the COVID-19 vaccine. You can't buy it - anywhere. The vaccine is only available at federal- and state-approved locations. - Watch for unexpected or unusual texts. If your health care provider or pharmacist has used text messages to contact you in the past, you might get a text from them about the vaccine. If you get a text, call your health care provider or pharmacist directly to make sure they sent the text. But scammers are texting, too. So don't click on links in text messages - especially messages you didn't expect. - Don't open emails, attachments, or links from people you don't know, or that come unexpectedly. You could download dangerous [malware](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0011-malware)onto your computer or phone. - Don't share your personal, financial, or health information with people you don't know. No one from a vaccine distribution site, health care provider's office, pharmacy, or health care payer, like a private insurance company or Medicare, will call, text, or email you asking for your Social Security, credit card, or bank account number to sign you up to get the vaccine.
