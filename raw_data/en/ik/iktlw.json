It is the entrance for prana, the life force, which comes into the body through the breath. Healthy uncongested breathing is important to ensure proper flow of prana throughout the head and body. When an excess of bodily fluids accumulates in the sinus, throat, nose, or head areas, it is best eliminated through the nose. Administration of herbally infused oil, or nasya, helps facilitate this cleansing process. Nasya Oil soothes and protects the nasal passage while nourishing the tissues. Daily nasal lubrication helps to release tension in the head and relieve accumulated stress. Balancing for vata, pitta, and kapha, Nasya Oil is also traditionally said to improve quality of voice, strengthen vision, and promote mental clarity.

Visit banyanbotanicals.com to find out your unique constitution.Have you ever longed for a straightforward map illuminating the elusive path to vibrant health, meaningful purpose, and an enduring sense of peace, contentment, and joy? Look no further. Ayurveda literally means, 'knowledge of life' and the scope of the Ayurvedic tradition is truly no less encompassing. While it is thought to be over 5000 years old, Ayurveda remains as relevant as ever\u2014and it is enlivened every day as individuals around the world engage its timeless wisdom in their own lives. Embracing the Individual Ayurveda is rooted in the idea that each of us is born with a completely personal blueprint for optimum health. From birth onward, it is this reference point\u2014your constitution\u2014that, in many ways, defines who you are. No two constitutions are exactly alike. Therefore, no two human beings can have precisely the same expression of ideal health. Your constitution, which is inherently unique to you, goes hand in hand with a similarly personal set of vulnerabilities. Together, they provide an invaluable context from which to consider the sum total of your life experience. In other words, the underlying framework is just as critical to understanding your current state of health as any imbalances affecting your system. A seasoned Ayurvedic practitioner uses all of this information to identify the root of any departure from one's natural state of equilibrium, and to determine how balance might be restored. In this way, Ayurveda is a remarkably individualized system of medicine. But it is so much more than that. It is an unequivocally holistic tradition intended to help each of us sync up with our truest inner nature, honor and develop our strengths, hone in on our challenge areas, redirect detrimental tendencies, and offer real support wherever it's needed\u2014so that we can better maintain balance in the face of adversity. This is about more than avoiding disease; it is about claiming and celebrating our capacity for a fully embodied sense of well-being. Defining Health The Sanskrit word for health, svastha , describes an authentically harmonious interaction of many parts within the whole\u2014such that the mind, soul, and senses are infused with an abiding sense of Self, wellness, and even bliss. Achieving this quality of life may seem a lofty ambition, especially when human beings throughout the world are riddled with stress, anxiety, and chronic disease. But Ayurveda provides us with a treasure chest of elegant and insightful tools that can be used to assess the degree of discord (no matter how slight or severe), determine its root, and ultimately, reclaim balance in our lives.

If you are tall and slender, creative, gregarious, excitable and yet somewhat non-committal, chances are that vata is one of your predominant doshas. If this is the case, you already have a lot of vata in your system and may be somewhat predisposed to vata aggravation. But like increases like, so any number of other influences can also trigger excess vata: a lifestyle characterized by over-activity, stimulation, busyness, and stress; major life transitions; a change of seasons; or vata season itself (typically fall and winter). If you are over 50 years of age, you should also consider that you are in the vata stage of life, and that vata tends to increase as we age. Whatever the case, vata-pacifying oils and herbal formulas can be deeply supportive.

How about even giving yourself a massage every day? It's easier than you might think and oh so worth it. Abhyanga, the term used to describe an Ayurvedic oil massage, is recommended for almost everybody of any age, from a newborn child to an elderly person. Whether you enjoy a warm oil massage from a massage therapist or take a little time to massage yourself, the benefits are well worth the investment. Why is warm oil an important part of massage? In Sanskrit, the word \"sneha\" can be translated as both \"oil\" and \"love\". So in Ayurveda, there is an inherent connection between enveloping the body in oil and enveloping it in love. Both oil and love provide a sense of nurturing, grounding, and nourishment. These qualities benefit the entire body, particularly the nervous system; and most importantly, they support the entire being\u2014body, mind and spirit. Giving yourself a massage with warm oil gives you the opportunity to give love and nourishment to yourself. Ancient Ayurvedic texts describe the benefits of massage for the whole body and specifically outline the benefits of applying oil to the scalp, the ears, and the feet. Because Ayurveda considers the scalp, the ears, and the feet to be maps representing the whole body, massaging these areas can positively impact other bodily parts and systems. Ayurvedic teachings recommend a daily self-massage, which need only take about 15 minutes. The rewards include support of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, proper circulation and lymph drainage, and regular sleep patterns, to name a few. Oil massage stimulates the scalp and promotes lustrous hair. It can also be helpful in the process of aging gracefully. And in Ayurvedic terms, it is of benefit to all three doshas\u2014vata, pitta, and kapha, especially vata. Dr. Claudia Welch offers a wonderful self-massage routine that can be done in the morning for a vital day or before bed for a more restful sleep. To learn this practice please visit www.banyanbotanicals.com/selfmassage. Enveloping the Body in Love Full body massage is one of the most powerful techniques used in Ayurveda. Massage done with warm herbalized oil brings lubrication and oleation to the body while also grounding the nervous system and providing the tissues with the benefits of herbs that are cooked into the oil. Daily Massage Oil is formulated to balance all three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. The base uses both warming and cooling oils to allow the oil to have a simultaneously penetrating and soothing effect. The traditional cooking process then brings together powerful Ayurvedic herbs like guduchi to soothe and rejuvenate; bala to strengthen; and arjuna and tulsi to invigorate, promote circulation, and support the lymphatic system. This blend not only supports the physical body but also calms and steadies the mind with brahmi (gotu kola) and bhringaraj. Finally, the oil is also pleasing, soothing, and revitalizing to the senses and spirit with a light hint of lavender and lemon verbena.

Add rice and mung beans and saut\u00e9 for another couple of minutes. Then add 6 cups of water and bring to a boil. Once the kitchari has come to a boil reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until it is tender (approx. 30-45 minutes). If you are adding vegetables to your kitchari, add the longer cooking vegetables such as carrots and beets halfway through the cooking. Add the vegetables that cook faster such as leafy greens near the end. Add more water if needed. Typically, kitchari is the consistency of a vegetable stew as opposed to a broth. Garnish with fresh cilantro and add salt to taste (optional).You may have heard about cleansing and just how good it is for you. So what now? Should you really take time out of your busy schedule to cleanse? And if so, how do you actually do a cleanse? Ayurvedic cleansing is simple and easy and can be done in the comfort of your own home. Use the information below to start unlocking the vast potential of your health and well-being. Why do a Cleanse You may already be taking care of yourself by eating healthy food, doing yoga and exercising. So why do you need to do a cleanse? Because prevention is the name of the game, and even the finest instruments require tuning on a periodic basis. A cleanse based on Ayurvedic principles allows your body the opportunity to rest and rejuvenate, as well as remove toxins that may have accumulated in your system. Most of us have some exposure to unhealthy toxins in our food, water, and environment. Poorly digested food can further add to a build-up of toxins, which Ayurveda calls ama . This toxic build-up in the system causes sub-optimal performance of your body's tissues and organs, right down to the cellular level. Signs that toxic residue has accumulated in your system may include a heavy coating on your tongue, sluggishness after you eat, foggy thinking, and joint and muscle aches. Cleansing starts the clean-up process and leaves you feeling lighter and refreshed. The benefits from doing even the simplest cleanse can be powerful. An Ayurvedic cleanse can help: Usher toxic residue out of the system Kindle the digestive fire Reset the metabolism Support healthy weight management Increase energy and vitality Rest and rejuvenate the body's tissues Balance and harmonize the doshas (vata, pitta, and kapha) Improve clarity of thinking and memory Reduce generalized aches (that are not related to other health issues) Support healthy flow of prana (the body's life force) Boost the body's natural ability to resist disease There are a variety of ways to cleanse. Ayurveda's full cleanse is called Panchakarma, which can be done with a trained practitioner. However, a simpler, less involved yet highly effective version of this is to do a whole foods cleanse at home, which is what we describe here. How to do a Cleanse Just a few easy steps form the foundation of your cleansing experience: 1. Mono Diet Kitchari for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Kitchari is considered a nutritionally whole food. Made from rice and yellow mung dal, this very basic Ayurvedic combination is considered one of the easiest foods to digest, allowing the digestive system to rest and reset while giving your tissues nourishment and sustenance. It is important to have cooked, easy to digest foods during a cleanse because this allows the body to turn its attention from breaking down your food to actually mobilizing and getting rid of toxic build-up. Make your kitchari with digestive spices like turmeric, cumin and ginger, which not only add great flavor, but also kindle the digestive fire and boost the immune system. Add some ghee as internal oleation helps loosen toxins. And finish the recipe with fresh seasonal vegetables of your choice, giving you valuable fiber as well as vitamins and minerals. Learn how to make kitchari with our video. Sip hot water and hot detox tea. Hot water kindles digestion and also helps naturally flush toxins from the system. Sip hot water throughout the day, and also hydrate yourself with plenty of room temperature water if needed, but avoid cold, iced drinks and caffeine. Start and end your day with a cup Made with 97% organic ingredients, this traditional spice mix helps stimulate your digestive fire so you can absorb all the wholesome goodness from your food. The spice mix includes mustard seeds, cumin seeds, ginger, turmeric, natural mineral salt, and asafoetida and is intended to be added to rice and dal when you prepare kitchari.$7.50 / #K1703 / 3.5 oz bagCleanse Simply The Why, How, and When of Ayurvedic Cleansing at Home Ingredients: 1 cup basmati rice 12 cup mung dal 3 teaspoons kitchari spice mix 2 tablespoons ghee 6 cups water 1 - 2 cups chopped vegetables (optional) Preparation: Wash rice and mung dal and soak overnight.

Ayurvedic Cleanse Kit This kit was created to provide the basic supplies you need to do a 7-day detoxifying cleanse at home. THE KIT CONTAINS 7-day supply Organic Basmati Rice (3.15 lbs), 7-day supply Organic Mung Dal (1.63 lbs), 1 bag Kitchari Spice Mix (3.5 oz), 1 bottle Organic Triphala Tablets, 1 16oz bottle of Organic Sesame Oil, 1 7.5oz jar Organic Ghee, 1 box Organic Detox TeaKitchari Kit THE KIT CONTAINS 7-day supply Organic Basmati Rice (3.15 lbs), 7-day supply Organic Mung Dal (1.63 lbs), 1 bag Kitchari Spice Mix (3.5 oz), 1 7.5 oz jar Organic Ghee Organic Basmati Rice Organic Mung Dal$7.95 / #5211 $16.95 / #8215$11.95 #3165 / 7.5 oz (212 g) $69.95 / #1700 / Retail value $77.20$37.70 bagof an herbal detox tea. If you want, you can make it at home with fresh spices like cumin, coriander, fennel, and fresh ginger. Leave at least 5 hours between meals. This affords ample time for digestion and allows the body to remove the toxic stores that have been tucked away in the tissues for long periods of time. For this reason, try to avoid snacking. If you are ravenously hungry, go ahead and have a snack that incorporates the same ingredients as the kitchari, and eat a larger portion at your next sitting to hold you over between meals. You may find that this gets easier with time. 2. Self-Oil Massage This incredibly nourishing treat for yourself also serves a vital role in the cleansing process. It helps mobilize toxins from the tissues while also calming the nervous system so that the body can move from stress-fighting functions to rejuvenating functions. Only in the parasympathetic rest and relax paradigm can the cells repair themselves, bringing healing to the body and a renewed state of well-being. Using warm oil is key in the massage, as this allows the oil to more deeply penetrate season, allowing the body to more easily adapt to the incoming season. However, a gentle home cleanse can be done at almost any time that suits your schedule, whenever you feel the need to reset your digestion and remove toxicity. Make time to allow yourself to slow down and experience the benefits of the cleanse, rather than maintaining a hectic, stressful daily routine that may have contributed to the toxic build-up in the first place. If you are new to cleansing and just want to give this a try, you can start with a mini one-day cleanse. Even this is enough to give your digestive system a break, boosting the immune system, balancing doshas and removing unwanted residue. If you are ready to really experience the benefits of the home cleanse, commit to a three- to seven-day process, following the same routine on a daily basis. Add some gentle yoga and journaling to deepen your cleansing experience and to gain insight into your healing process. During this time, you may feel ups and downs, but stay with it, and you will definitely experience the uplifting benefits by the end\u2014 in body, mind, and spirit. Post-Cleanse Once you have finished the cleanse, gently and consciously reintroduce activities into your daily routine, as quickly jumping back into your previous habits will be a shock to the system, rapidly re-building toxins and imbalancing doshas. Take some time to re-introduce other elements back into your normal diet, waiting a few extra days if you can to have heavier foods like dairy and meat. If there are previous habits that you know weren't serving and nourish the tissues. Plus it feels good! Read how to do a self-massage on page 38. 3. Triphala The final key for any cleanse is to, well, CLEANSE! A gentle home cleanse does not have to include harsh purgatives. The most important thing is to give the body the opportunity to flush the toxins with regular, healthy bowel movements. Triphala helps gently support this type of cleansing while also being a powerful source of anti-oxidants. It rejuvenates the tissues, leaving you feeling lighter and revitalized. Take 2 tablets at bedtime. Alternately, if you prefer the traditional method of powder, take \u00bd tsp at bedtime with warm water, or steep in hot water at bedtime and drink in the morning. Adjust your dose as needed according to your body's response. When to do a Cleanse Ayurveda traditionally recommends cleansing at natural transition points, such as the change of seasons. As the body shifts gears to adjust to the changes in the environment, a cleanse supports a gentle removal of the buildup from the passing your health, now is a great time to let them go. And if you found portions of the cleanse beneficial, like the self-massage or triphala, feel free to incorporate them into your longterm daily routine. The days that follow a cleanse are a great time to start taking rejuvenating herbs and formulas like ashwagandha and Chyavanprash. They will continue to nourish the system and bolster energy and vitality. Take ashwagandha before bed (2 tablets or \u00bd tsp boiled in a cup of milk with sweetener to taste). One or two teaspoons of Chyavanprash can be taken most anytime up to two times daily. To read more about cleansing, download our Ebook at www.banyanbotanicals.com/ cleanse_ebook.
