In addition, vaccine recommendations have evolved over the past several decades, culminating in the recommendation for universal hepatitis B immunization for all persons younger than 60 years of age.[ [2](#reference-1513)] The following briefly summarizes the chronology and type of hepatitis B vaccines licensed for use in the United States ( [Figure 1](//cdn.hepatitisb.uw.edu/doc/464-4/history-hepatitis-b-vaccines-licensed-united-states.jpg)). - The first hepatitis B vaccine, which was plasma-derived, was licensed in the United States in 1981.[ [3](#reference-1265)] This vaccine contained purified plasma-derived hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and was safe and highly successful in preventing [3](#reference-1265), [4](#reference-1267), [5](#reference-1266)] Nevertheless, the first-generation was tedious to manufacture, and the plasma-derived vaccine led to unsubstantiated concerns regarding the potential for bloodborne pathogen transmission and was eventually discontinued in 1992.[ [3](#reference-1265)] - By the mid-1980s, the second generation of hepatitis B vaccines became commercially available\u2014Recombivax-HB and Engerix-B. These vaccines utilized recombinant DNA technology to express a nonglycosylated hepatitis B surface antigen in yeast cells, a process that was more cost-effective and scalable than the plasma-derived method.[ [3](#reference-1265), [4](#reference-1267)] transmission.[ [3](#reference-1265)] - In the 1990s, mammalian cell-derived HBV vaccines became commercially available. These vaccines contain both the S antigen and either the pre-S2 or the pre-S2 and pre-S1 HBV antigens. Although studies suggested these vaccines were efficacious in conventional HBV vaccine nonresponders and overall more immunogenic than yeast-derived recombinant vaccines, manufacturing costs were higher, and they were not widely used.[ [6](#reference-1269)] - In 2017, the hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Heplisav-B contains a yeast-derived recombinant HBsAg as well as a novel cytidine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide (Cpg ODN) adjuvant that binds toll-like receptor 9 and stimulates a more robust immune response to HBsAg than the historical alum adjuvant.[ [7](#reference-906)] The Heplisav B vaccine is recommended for use in adults aged 18 years of age and older and represents the fifth inactivated HBV vaccine recommended in the United States.[ [7](#reference-906)] - In 2021, the newest HBV vaccine, PreHevbrio, was approved by the FDA in 2021.[ [2](#reference-1513)] PreHevbrio is a tri-antigenic HBV vaccine pre-S1, pre-S2, and S HBV surface antigens.[ [8](#reference-1447)] It is approved for adults 18 years of age and older but not recommended in pregnant persons or those on dialysis, due to lack "}
