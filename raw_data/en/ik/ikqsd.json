The Love is Real I ordered Force of Nature a few weeks ago and I absolutely LOVE it. I have pretty much cleaned EVERYTHING in my home, from wood floors to baby toys. I'm so glad some friends told me about this product. I've been using this product for almost a year and not only does it save us a lot of money (hundreds in cleaning supplies) but it's reduced how many of those massive plastic containers we used to throw away...I will continue to recommend this to everyone. We started using Force of Nature when our 1st child was born, looking for a clean/more natural cleaner that would be safe to use around a baby. We have continued using this product for years now, and LOVE it!!! It cleans everything so well, and I don't have to worry about harsh chemicals around my kids! As a physician, it's really important for me to sanitize my home and office spaces. It's equally important to me to avoid potentially toxic ingredients around my children and patients. I am thankful for this excellent product and highly recommend it. I cannot tell you how life changing your product has been for me. All of the other products out that actually kill germs are incredibly dangerous, and the non toxic ones are simply not effective. For anyone out there who thinks \"how can these simple ingredients actually clean?\" please trust me you will not be disappointed TRY IT Holy clean! I've had this a week and I'm in love! As a crunchy person I've spent years trying to find an all purpose cleaner I love. I've found it! If you are on the fence about ordering, DO IT! Thank you Force of Nature for this genius invention! This is completely unpaid not sponsored, I'm just this excited lol. Where has this stuff been my whole life? Having the ability to disinfect something without worry of harming it, or the people/pets around, is a game changer! Seriously this is the best multi-use product I've ever experienced in my 35 years on this planet. I'm a Pulmonologist and keeping our staff and patients safe is critical.
