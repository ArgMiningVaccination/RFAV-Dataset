In my [telehealth functional medicine clinic](https://drwillcole.com/), I see so often women who haven't been taken seriously by their conventional doctors over real issues that affect them on a daily basis. When it comes to women's reproductive and hormone health unfortunately, it can be all too easy to dismiss symptoms that are part of a larger, underlying problem. One of the biggest issues I see many of my patients struggle with are ovarian cysts. These painful cysts sit on the ovaries that produce a woman's eggs, control fertility, and produce female hormones necessary for overall thriving health. If we want to take women's health seriously, it is time to address the issues women face that are unique to their health. So let's take a look at how to get rid of ovarian cysts naturally, and what steps need to be taken to overcome this common health problem.

What is an ovarian cyst? Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs or pockets that are inside or on the surface of an ovary. Women have two ovaries and cysts can appear on one or both at a time. While most people with ovarian cysts don't experience any symptoms, for some people they can lead to a variety of symptoms that can become chronic if not addressed. Simple cysts Also known as functional ovarian cysts, these are the most common form of ovarian cysts. There are two types of functional cysts depending on how they develop: - Follicle cysts: These occur when the follicle of your ovary doesn't open to release an egg and stays closed instead causing it to fill with liquid. - Corpus luteum cysts: These form when your follicle doesn't seal off after releasing an egg. Can ovarian cysts shrink on their own? Typically simple cysts don't have any symptoms and heal themselves after a few menstrual cycles. Complex cysts There are three possible types of complex cysts. Unlike simple cysts, complex cysts are not associated with your menstrual cycle and are a lot more rare. While they are usually benign and are not cancerous, they can come with some uncomfortable symptoms. - Cystadenomas: This type of cyst contains fluid or mucus alongside ovarian tissue - Dermoid cysts: These cysts are formed from cells you had while growing inside your mother's womb that make up dermal tissue. These cysts therefore can contain skin, hair, teeth, or fat - Endometriomas: Often associated with endometriosis, these types of cysts happen when the cells from your uterine lining grow outside of your uterus and onto your ovaries. What exactly causes ovarian cysts are different for each person but it ultimately comes down to a hormonal imbalance between estrogen and progesterone that can interfere with the proper development of tissue. If you are struggling with ovarian cysts, you are more likely to be estrogen dominant leading your body to hold onto too much estrogen and not enough progesterone. Certain health problems involving the hormones like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Endometriosis can contribute to the development of both simple and complex cysts. When you have a hormonal imbalance, it can prevent ovarian cysts from shrinking or reoccurring in the future. Symptoms of ovarian cysts Thankfully simple cysts - which are the most common - are not associated with any symptoms. However, sometimes very minor symptoms can occur such as: - Bloating - Abdominal pain - Sudden pain (only if the cyst bursts) With complex cysts, especially in the case of health problems like PCOS and Endometriosis, these minor symptoms can also be coupled with more chronic symptoms: - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Constipation - Fatigue - Painful, heavy periods - Pain during sex - Infertility - Frequent urination - Digestive distress - Irregular menstrual cycles No two people are going to experience the same set of symptoms so it's important to listen to your body and pay attention if you are experiencing one or more of these symptoms. If you believe you have ovarian cysts, an ultrasound can determine whether or not they are present on your ovaries. When to seek medical attention If your symptoms become severe and you are experiencing nausea and vomiting alongside severe abdominal pain and a fever, it's important to seek medical attention immediately as those are signs of a ruptured cyst that can lead to infection. So can you get rid of a cyst without surgery? If you are experiencing symptoms associated with complex cysts, your doctor can determine whether more complex treatments or surgical intervention is needed. Only a small percentage of women require surgery to remove ovarian cysts, whereas the majority are typically treated in conventional medicine with hormonal birth control to limit the development of cysts and reduce associated symptoms. How Can I Shrink My Ovarian Cysts Naturally? So what helps decrease ovarian cysts? In functional medicine try to utilize the type of treatment that will have the greatest results while also contributing to the least amount of side effects. In some cases of complex cysts, surgery is absolutely necessary. However, for simple cysts we try to stay clear from hormonal birth control as much as possible due to the side effects that can be associated with taking birth control long-term. These are some of the tools and remedies we turn to first when looking at how to dissolve ovarian cysts naturally and bring symptom relief while healing. 1. Apple cider vinegar While more long-term research needs to be done on the efficacy of apple cider vinegar, there are many anecdotal reports that regularly consuming apple cider vinegar on a daily basis can help shrink ovarian cysts. Since ACV can also help with acid reflux, digestive distress, and other health problems with little to no side effects, this can be a great option to incorporate into your daily routine if you struggle with ovarian cysts. Just be aware that what works for one person anecdotally won't necessarily work for you. 2. Pain killers Even though over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen are less-than friendly on your gut, sometimes they can be helpful in the short term while you are working on incorporating more of these natural remedies. Ideally, we would recommend using curcumin as a natural painkiller instead of an over-the-counter medication. Curcumin - the active compound found in turmeric - is known for its powerful anti-inflammatory capabilities and has even [been shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22407780/) to help alleviate chronic pain in people with Rheumatoid Arthritis. (1) That's why I formulated my supplement [The Curcumin](https://drwillcole.com/product/the-curcumin) to help drive down inflammation and alleviate pain without having to take more medication. 3. Heat Heat is a great way to alleviate pain from cysts and can work just as well as over-the-counter medications for moderate pain. You can wet a towel and place it in the microwave for a few minutes or fill a sock with rice and put that in the microwave. Or if you are looking for a more portable option, an electric heating pad also does the trick. 4. Massage Pain from ovarian cysts can lead to tense muscles and overall body aches. Massage can help relieve pain by relaxing muscles in the lower back or abdomen. 5. Ginger Ginger has been used for hundreds of years as a natural remedy to relieve digestive distress, nausea, cramping, and pain. Not only can ginger help ease any symptoms associated with painful cysts, studies have shown that ginger can actually [inhibit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2241638/) the growth of cancerous ovarian cells, making it a fantastic choice for anyone dealing with chronic ovarian cysts. (2) You can find ginger in tea form or natural ginger chews, just make sure they don't have any added sugar! 6. Diet The food we eat on a daily basis can either push us closer to healing or further away. In functional medicine, we believe food is the foundation for optimal health and that dietary changes can be the first step at addressing the underlying causes behind your health problems. If you're wondering how to dissolve a cyst naturally, or better yet how to prevent ovarian cysts, dietary changes can help rebalance hormones like estrogen and progesterone in order to shrink ovarian cysts and prevent them from reoccurring. In cases of PCOS, insulin resistance is common and can contribute to other hormonal imbalances so a diet focused on addressing insulin levels through reduced sugar consumption and clean, whole foods higher in fat and protein would be one way of addressing PCOS-related ovarian cysts. How long does it take to shrink an ovarian cyst? Since everyone's biochemistry and health case is different, it's difficult to put a definitive timeline on how long it will take to shrink an ovarian cyst. With any sort of dietary or lifestyle adjustment, changes need to be made consistently for at least 3 months in order to start seeing changes and some symptom relief. However, it can take anywhere between 12 and 24 months to see more long-term, sustainable changes. A doctor can help put together a plan of care with dietary and lifestyle changes that works for you and will be able to better determine through hormone labs how your healing is progressing. Possible side effects Since simple cysts often resolve on their own, there are not many side effects to be concerned about but in some extreme cases a ruptured cyst depending on how large and the severity, can lead to fever, dizziness, vomiting, rapid breathing, and internal bleeding that need to be addressed immediately before infection occurs. Complex ovarian cysts on the other hand can lead to ovarian torsion, a condition where your ovary becomes twisted, if they grow too large and push your ovary out of place. It is also important to address the underlying cause of why you are experiencing complex cysts as they can increase your risk for ovarian cancer. Next Steps In functional medicine, we aim to find the root cause of why you are experiencing ovarian cysts instead of covering up symptoms with medication. Once we understand the reason behind why your body is developing cysts, we can look at how to shrink ovarian cysts naturally. Functional medicine uses a combination of cutting edge hormone labs and the most up-to-date research on using food as medicine to come up with a plan of action for shrinking cysts and preventing them from developing in the first place. Considering complex ovarian cysts are often a symptom of a larger health condition such as PCOS or endometriosis, addressing the root cause becomes even more important as these conditions have a variety of other chronic symptoms that can impact your daily life.
