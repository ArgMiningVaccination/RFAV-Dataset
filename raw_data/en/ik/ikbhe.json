Regardless of the specifics of your condition, we're glad to consult with you and explore your treatment options. Our patients take advantage of services within the following specialties: [Chiropractic Care:](/chiropractic-care/)Chiropractic care is a specialty that focuses on disorders affecting the musculoskeletal system. We might recommend a variety of treatments, including laser therapy, whole-body vibration, disc decompression, or kinesiotaping. Visiting the chiropractor is a safe, non-invasive way of minimizing pain and maximizing movement ability. [Physical Therapy:](/chiropractic-care/physical-therapy-rehab/)Have you been the victim of an accident? Perhaps you've developed a condition such as arthritis or carpal tunnel. In both of these cases, physical therapy and rehabilitation is an effective way to restore your flexibility, strength, and range of motion. [Functional Medicine:](/medical/)Good healthcare treatments consider more than just the symptoms of an illness or injury. Functional medicine strives to address the root cause of your condition, taking into account your medical history, lifestyle, and genetic factors. [Acupuncture:](/acupuncture/)Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese treatment widely used today to promote blood flow and enhance overall wellbeing. This treatment uses thin needles to target specific areas in the body and restore physical energy flow. Despite the use of needles, acupuncture is relaxing rather than uncomfortable. [Massage Therapy:](/chiropractic-care/massage-therapy/)Massages are a great way to relax after a stressful day at work, but they're also an excellent option for reducing chronic pain and muscle aches. The team at Effective Integrative Healthcare specializes in several types of massage therapy, and we'll recommend the technique best suited to you. [Medical Weight Loss:](/medical/medical-weight-loss-programs/)Weight loss is tricky, even in the best of circumstances. Sometimes, we could use a little help sticking to a diet and shedding pounds. Our medical weight loss program is ideal for those who want to lose weight safely. We'll help you come up with a customized plan for sustainable change. Are You Affected by One of These Conditions?

Our practitioners will look at all aspects of your injury and come up with a personalized treatment plan.

After a sports injury and any emergency care, look to our providers for help with making a full recovery. [Auto Accidents:](/chiropractic-care/auto-accident-treatment/)Motor vehicle accidents can cause all kinds of physical injuries. Back pain, chronic headaches, and herniated discs are all common after a crash, not to mention the mental and emotional side effects. Effective Integrative Healthcare can help you recover from an accident with physical therapy, trigger point injections, acupuncture, and a range of other treatments. Committed to All Four Phases of Care Our team has mastered all [four major phases of chiropractic care](/about-us/the-four-phases-of-care/). Every patient who comes to us for these services can count on all-encompassing treatment plans that account for all aspects of bodily health. Learn more about our goals during each phase of care: - Relief Care: This first phase of chiropractic care focuses on providing relief from pain, inflammation, and nerve irritation. Making frequent appointments is key in this phase as we work toward making steady progress. - Corrective Care: Corrective care's goal is to improve flexibility and strength and set patients up for long-term results. During this phase, we'll work to reposition joints, increase range of motion, and introduce healthy daily habits. - Strengthening Care: Next, we begin strengthening the muscles and joints. This phase of care doesn't require frequent visits to our office, but it does call for plenty of patience as you continue to work toward rehabilitation. Remember, recovery is a jog, not a sprint! - Wellness Care: Wellness care begins once the patient is mostly recovered from their painful condition. It involves regular checkups to maintain physical results and emotional wellbeing.

The staff is always professional and friendly. Great place when you are feeling bad they really care. I have been coming here to see Dr. Angela while I was pregnant, helping me to relieve sciatic pain. As a result, I was able to go full term and deliver my daughter naturally and without complications.

We continue to get outstanding chiropractic care from Dr. Aric for both of my daughters and me. We believe that we don't get sick as much and our immune system are improved because of chiropractic care.
