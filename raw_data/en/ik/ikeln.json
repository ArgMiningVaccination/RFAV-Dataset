The publicly-funded vaccines virus (the flu) is very contagious. The flu spreads by respiratory droplets, causing an infection of the nose, throat and lungs. The symptoms are sudden onset of fever, sore throat, runny nose, cough, headaches, chills, muscle aches, feeling tired, and loss of appetite. In children, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea can occur. Serious complications from flu illness are greatest in children under five years of age, pregnant people, older adults, and people with health conditions. On very rare occasions, the influenza virus can lead to [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html#:~:text=Additional%20studies%20have%20been%20conducted,cause%20severe%20illness%20and%20death.), a neurological disorder. Flu vaccination is recommended for everyone aged six months and older. How well the vaccine works each year, depends on a person's immune system and the match with the circulating virus strains. The vaccine can provide some cross protection even when the match is not exact. In general, flu vaccines are about 50% effective in preventing flu illness in healthy adults. The vaccine can reduce the risk of having go to the doctor with the flu by about [50 per cent, and reduce the risk of serious flu complications](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm) that can result in hospitalization or even death. The vaccine is still the best protection against the flu. The flu vaccine cannot cause influenza because it does not contain any live virus. It takes two weeks for your body to develop an immune response from the vaccine. Children under the age of nine years old who are getting the flu vaccine for the first time need a second dose at least four weeks after the first dose. The flu can make older adults very sick. Two vaccines are approved just for seniors to give better protection against the flu. Both vaccines provide additional protection to seniors against the flu. Both of these vaccines may cause more soreness, redness and swelling where the vaccine was given, lasting a few days longer than the standard flu vaccine. The flu is more likely to cause illness that results in hospitalization in pregnant people than in people of reproductive age who are not pregnant. [The flu may also be harmful for the developing baby](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/qa_vacpregnant.htm#:~:text=A%20Flu%20Vaccine%20is%20the,and%20the%20baby%20from%20flu.). The flu vaccine is safe and recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding people to reduce the risk of getting very sick from the flu. Vaccination can also protect the fetus and newborn. It is much safer to get the flu vaccine than to get the flu. Flu vaccines are safe, and side effects are usually mild and last a few days. Common side effects include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, headache, fever, muscle aches, joint pain or feeling tired. Side effects in children include irritability, drowsiness, or loss of appetite. In rare cases, serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can occur. Seek medical attention if you have trouble breathing, rash or swelling of the face and throat. Allergic reactions can be treated and are usually temporary. The risk of [Oculo-Respiratory Syndrome](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/vaccines-immunization/canadian-immunization-guide-statement-seasonal-influenza-vaccine-2022-2023.html) is very low. The risk of [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html#:~:text=Additional%20studies%20have%20been%20conducted,cause%20severe%20illness%20and%20death.) after flu vaccination is very low, at about one case in a million flu vaccines given. The risk of Guillain-Barre Syndrome is higher following an influenza infection. Always tell your health care provider if you have allergies or if you have had side effects from a vaccine in the past. This vaccine is not for people with previous allergic reactions to flu vaccine (anaphylaxis) or people who have had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome within six weeks after flu vaccination. People with a history of Oculo-Respiratory Syndrome can get the vaccine but should speak with their doctor first.
