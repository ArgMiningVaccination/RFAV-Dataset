These are kidney stones, also known as renal calculi. They usually originate in the kidneys but can also develop along the urinary tract that includes the bladder, ureters, and urethra. Let us now see how kidney stones are formed. How Do They Form? Kidney stones are caused by inadequate consumption of water. If you consume less than 8-10 glasses of water a day, you are putting yourself at risk of developing kidney stones. The less amount of water in your body cannot dilute uric acid, which, in turn, makes your urine more acidic. The increasing acidity of urine leads to the formation of stones. If you have been diagnosed with or have a family history of medical conditions like Crohn's diseasei [X]A chronic bowel disease that causes inflammation in the digestive tract and leads to symptoms like diarrhea, fatigue, and stomach pain. , urinary tract infections, medullary sponge kidneyi [X]A congenital disorder characterized by small cysts in the tubes of the fetus's kidney that occur during birth. , etc., you are likely to develop kidney stones.

The 12-month incidence of kidney stones was estimated to be 2.1%, indicating that there were approximately 2,054 cases of kidney stones per 100,000 adults. - Family history of kidney stones - Inadequate [consumption of water](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-water-for-skin-hair-and-health/) - Obesity - Consuming [foods with high glucose](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/foods-high-in-sugar-to-avoid/), salt, and protein - Inflammatory bowel diseasesi [X]A group of diseases that cause chronic inflammation in the tissues of the digestive tract, leading to abdominal pain.
