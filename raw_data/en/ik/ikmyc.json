Chiropractic Medicine Chiropractic physicians use hands-on, drug-free approaches to health and wellness. Chiropractors have broad diagnostic skills and are trained to use clinical examinations, laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging and other interventions in the evaluation and management of patients. One of the most common and well-known procedures in chiropractic medicine is spinal manipulation (also known as a \"chiropractic adjustment\"). These treatments can be used to improve joint mobility and reduce pain. Chiropractic care can benefit many conditions such as neck and back pain, headaches, muscle sprains and strains, extremity pain, and pain during pregnancy. Aside from manipulation, chiropractors are also trained to recommend therapeutic exercise and provide lifestyle counseling. Educational requirements of doctors of chiropractic include a 4-year doctoral program at nationally accredited colleges following undergraduate coursework. After graduation, chiropractors must pass a series of national board exams in order to receive a license and must maintain their license via participation in ongoing continuing education programs. Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine incorporates the diagnosis and management of primary care patients through natural means that can include nutrition, wellness counseling, botanicals medicine, physical medicine, homeopathy, and hydrotherapy. The principles of naturopathic medicine include a focus on the healing power of nature, determining the root cause of an illness, treating the whole person, prevention of future illness, and education. Naturopathic doctors follow a therapeutic order, starting with the simplest, least invasive treatment, which can include improving diet, sleep and hydration and progress to higher force interventions, when appropriate. Naturopathic doctors also have expertise in drug/herb/nutrient interactions. Educational requirements for naturopathic doctors include completion of a four-year doctoral program at an accredited naturopathic medical school and extensive postdoctoral board exams. "}
