The review was conducted by a speciallyconvened Expert Committee on Complementary Medicines in the Health System, whichconsisted of 18 experts comprising representatives of the complementarymedicines industry, including academics and clinicians. One of the major recommendations from the committee was forthe Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) to ensure quality standards for allingredients used in complementary medicine are legally enforceable and claims bemore rigorously substantiated. The review also recommended that homoeopathicmedicines and related remedies making therapeutic claims be regulated to ensurethey meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy. In addition, the review made a number of recommendations tocounter adverse reactions to complementary medicines, including creating agreater awareness among all health professionals and consumers of the potentialfor complementary medicine to interact with other medicines, and informingconsumers about the potential risk of importing medicines for personal use. The review calls on state and territory governments tointroduce legislation to regulate practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicineand dispensers of Chinese herbs, based on existing legislation, as soon aspossible. The committee also recommended Internet advertising beconsidered part of mainstream advertising and be subject to mainstreamadvertising requirements and protocols, including complaint resolution through acentralized complaint and appeal process. The review makes a number of recommendations about improvingthe level of research and funding available for complementary medicine, and asksthe National Health and Medical Research Council to identify the industrysresearch needs, including issues around safety and efficacy. In 2000 it was estimated that 52 percent of Australiansused at least one non-medically prescribed complementary medicine, and 23percent consulted at least one complementary medicine practitioner, saidTrish Worth, secretary for health. This industry is estimated to be worthAUS$800 million, so it is vital that Australians feel confident in the industryand its products.
