Chiropractors are particularly interested in helping their chiropractic patients overcome these stressors in order to maintain a healthy and balanced life. Outside of the chiropractic adjustment, let's take a look at three [nutritional tips](https://www.nutrition.gov/) that will help chiropractic patients boost their immune system. Chiropractic patients' immune systems run their best when subluxations, also called vertebral misalignments, are corrected; however, a proper diet cannot be ignored. By combining both forces, your immune system is better equipped to ward off many contaminants that try to invade the body through normal day-to-day activity. Nutritional Tip #1 \u2014 Get Your Vitamin D [Vitamin D](http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/) is known for strengthening bones and teeth by helping the body absorb calcium. People who get too little vitamin D may develop soft, thin, or brittle bones, which is a condition known as \"rickets\" in children and \"osteomalacia\" in adults. But did you know vitamin D also is known to offer sufficient protection against a wide range of illnesses and chronic diseases such as cancer? Moreover, it improves the body's natural response to bacterial infections like tuberculosis and helps increase the production of antimicrobial peptides that are very important in boosting immunity. Since each person's health situation is different, ask your chiropractor how much vitamin D you need for optimal health. Nutritional Tip #2 \u2014 Eat Your Veggies In culinary terms, [vegetables](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/vegetables.html) are edible plants or their parts intended for cooking or eating raw. You can quickly find [what foods are in the vegetable group](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/vegetables.html) by visiting [ChooseMyPlate.gov](http://www.ChooseMyPlate.gov). Vegetables such as cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, and Brussel Sprouts (all from the Brassica family) produce chemicals that known to inhibit the cancer cell growth and boost the body's immune system. One great way to make sure you're getting all of your vegetables for the day is \"juicing\". If you're new to juicing, check out this great resource on [juicing vegetables](http://www.thebestofrawfood.com/juicing-vegetables-2.html). Nutritional Tip #3 \u2014 Avoid Alcohol Most chiropractic patients are health-conscious. However, new chiropractic patients may be oblivious to the entire concept, since our society is geared more toward sickness care instead of true healthcare. Either way, maintaining a healthy diet is absolutely essential to maintaining a strong immune system. One way to do this is by avoiding or reducing alcohol consumption. Why avoid alcohol? Because research has proven that alcohol can cause immunodeficiencies that, in return, can make you more susceptible to tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, and many other communicable diseases. In addition, the use of alcohol is linked to cancer. Although many people in our society consume it for recreational purposes, it is important to note that alcohol is a drug that can poison your body and deplete you of essential vitamins and minerals. Therefore, zero alcohol consumption translates into a super strong immune system. If you need more convincing, visit the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's website to learn more about [alcohol facts and its statistics](http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics).
