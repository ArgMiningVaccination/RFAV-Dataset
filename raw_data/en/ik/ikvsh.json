In the early morning hours around that time we could observe a constellation of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn which is seen only rarely and which was described by Rudolf Steiner in his lecture of April 7, 1920, in connection with epidemic diseases like the flu.1 It was a lecture in which R. Steiner acknowledge d the disease - specific activity of \"bacilli\" (bacteria/viruses) - often misleadingly presented differently on the Internet today - and in which he went into detail about what makes people particularly susceptible to such pathogens, creating a corresponding disposition to illness . We currently know how differently one and the same pathogen can become virulent in different people, and how much this depends on their disposition. In Germany on March 22 the Chancellor announced strict restrictions of contact in response to SARS - CoV-2 -- but no ban of contact! - before putting herself in quarantine after the doctor who had vaccinated her against pneumococcus te sted positive. In extraordinary haste, the Bundestag made the regulation to protect against infection more stringent the following week. The umbrella organization for anthroposophic medicine in Germany (DAMiD) had to cancel its major anniversary event to c elebrate the 100th anniversary in Stuttgart on March 21. We also cancelled our multidisciplinary Easter Conference 2020, the GA\u00c4D Academy's Academy Day and a doctoral seminar in Freiburg. The Medical Seminar Arlesheim held a webinar on March 28 to replace a weekend seminar that was cancelled . Nearly 170 colleagues (including some from the medical seminars in Havelh\u00f6he and Herdecke) took part. Each 30 -minute session consisted of a concentrated PowerPoint presentation on a specific topic followed by 15 minute s of discussion. The participants could send written questions to the moderator. Right at the beginning Prof. Philipp Tarr from Basel provided the latest information on the COVID -19 situation , followed by a presentation of the possibilities for prevention and therapy in Anthroposophic Medicine. This webinar can be regarded as a very successful, modern online training course, masterfully moderated by Philipp Busche and Johannes Weinzirl, making it important as a model for the whole network of training and co ntinuing education in Anthroposophic Medicine in Germany. Several anthroposophic clinics have intensive care units with ventilation facilities (Berlin, Herdecke, Filderklinik) and are currently treating patients with all degrees of severity as inpatients. The majority of patients receive medical care on an outpatient basis, especially since the disease progresses relatively mildly, but not quickly, in many cases. Initial observations seem to indicate that anthroposophic external applications and medicines adapted to this specific COVID -19 disease can provide effective help for patients. In March, the therapeutic procedure was very quickly coordinated among those involved and corresponding concepts were widely communica ted by doctors - also internationally - based on the documented experience of Anthroposophic Medicine 2 in the treatment 1 Steiner R.

On the same day Steiner also spoke about \"Hygiene - a Social Question\" (in Physiology and Healing 2013), where he emphasized the importance of external ap plications, among other things. 2 Vademecum Anthroposophische Heilmittel. 4th Der Merkurstab 70, 2017, Supplement. English translation: Vademecum of anthroposophic medicines. 3rd English ed. with CD. Munich: Association of Anthroposophic Physic ians in Germany; 2017. Questions in the SARS -CoV-2 epidemic page 2 of 4 of viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia.3 Efforts are also underway to evaluate the effectiveness of anthroposophic medical therapy by means of appropriate individual case documentation or even a study protocol. At an international hearing on integrative medical approac hes to COVID -19 infections in Geneva , it was shown that many patients in China were treated with traditional Chinese remedies. There seems to be a greater willingness on the part of the medical system to integrate \"the best of both\" - modern intensive care and complementary medicine in the form of TCM in this situation . There are striking similarities with Anthroposophic Medicine, for example in the use of bitter plant extracts. Anthroposophic Medicine was represented in Geneva by a coordinated and widely a pplicable therapy concept for COVID -19 patients presented by Thomas Breitkreuz and Tido von Schoen- Angerer. At the same time, on March 29, our colleagues at the Clinic for Homeotherapy at Klinikum Heidenheim were told that their department would be convert ed into a COVID -19 ward for two months. It can only be hoped that the clinic will make use of the therapeutic competence in this department during this time. March 31 marked the end of a 13 -year phase at Niederlausitz Hospital, during which, on the initiative of Martin -G\u00fcnther Sterner, integrative Anthroposophic Medicine had been practiced in the gastroenterology department. On April 1, he took over as deputy medical director of Lausitz Klinik Forst, heading the Clinic for Gastroenterology and the Center for Internal Medicine, Geriatrics and Integrative Medicine. Th ere in that cli nic near the German -Polish border there will now be new opportunities to integrate Anthroposophic Medicine. The COVID -19 crisis raises questions on several levels. First, it is becoming increasingly clear that the virus itself owes its existence to the eco logical crisis for which we are all partly responsible, as Environment Minister Schulze made unmistakably clear on April 2, who also stressed this link in the case of SARS -CoV-2. This crisis has only intensified in the \"wet markets\" of Wuhan, where bats, pangolins and human beings come too close to each other under unworthy circumstances. As a metropolis of 11 million people at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers, Wuhan stands for a multitude of ecological problems. The SARS -CoV-2 virus was able to spread rapidly worldwide from this most important inland port and central traffic junction in China. Medically, the infection almost always presents mildly in children and it is likely that they are not significant carriers of the infection before puberty. 4 The situation is very different from influenza, for example, where children can play a significant role as vectors. This is relevant to the question of the extent to which educational facilities for nursery and primary school children - where online teaching is not an alternative - should remain closed for longer. The obviously different response of children's immune system s to the pandemic coronavirus also shows how right R. Steiner was to po int to disposition as a decisive factor in understanding disease. For it is on the inflammatory response of the immune system and thus o n the human 'I' -organization that the course of the disease seems to depend.5 COVID -19 also usually, but not always, progresses mildly in adults, and particularly endangers the large number of our chronically ill and elderly fellow citizens with a more severe course. The disease, which often begins with a loss of the patient's sense of smell and taste and tends to be flu-like (\"scratchy throat\") in the first few days, seems to be able to penetrate t he lungs early on when the immune system is weakened and/or the viral load is high during infection. The latter can be the case especially for medical personnel, particularly when suitable intact mouth and nose protection is lacking. In 3 Recently Jan Vagedes and Tido von Schoen -Angerer published a retrospective study on pneumonia treatment in childhood: Restrictive antibiotic use in children hospitalized for pneumonia: A retrospective inpatient study. Europ J Integ r Medicine 34, 2020. 4 Children are unlikely to have been the primary source of household SARS -CoV-2 infections: https://bit.lv/2vJmfpb . We owe numerous references on this to Christian Kahlert, pediatrician and infect ious disease specialist at St. Gallen Cantonal Hospital. 5 The fact that type 2 diabetics seem to be more at risk can also be seen in this context. Steiner himself pointed out the connection between diabetes and the human 'I' -organization. See in detail Girke M. 375f. English translation: Girke M. Internal medicine. Foundations and therapeutic concepts of Anthroposophic Medicine. 1st ed. Berlin: Salumed; 2016 , p. 355f . Questions in the SARS -CoV-2 epidemic page 3 of 4 COVID -19 pneumonia, there are characteristically extensive infiltrations to the point of \"drowning the lungs\", massive hypoxemia with the need for machine ventilation and possibly extracorporeal oxygenation (ECMO). Kidney function and the cardiovascular system in particular are at risk. Even if only one percent or less of all infected people require d intensive care or ventilation, this c ould quickly overwhelm a healthcare system that provides intensive care beds for 10,000 citizens in Italy and, until recently, 3,000 in Germa ny. If one advocates \"herd protection\", with the necessity of 60 to 70 per cent of the population becoming immune , then even with a ventilation requirement of one tenth of a percent (0.1%) of all infected people in Germany this would result in more than 50 ,000 patients requiring ventilation, with an average duration of ventilation of 16 to 17 days per patient and a considerable mortality in this group. This illustrates the real rationale behind the policy of restricting contacts. Yet lived relationships are essential for human survival, especially in critical situations. To die alone is inhuman, and the closeness of a loved one can mobilize the life forces of even someone who is unconscious. With COVID -19 we are experiencing massive exclusion of people - such as a strict ban on visiting hospitalized COVID -19 patients in many places - even in cases where the patient's condition is critical, near -death or dying. Provided that the visitor can protect himself or herself and therefore also the staff sufficiently, it is not justified to deny visits to the next of kin, nor is it medically helpful. A sense of proportion and respect for human dignity is essential. The Chancellor stressed that there is no ban on contact, but rather restriction s of contact, and indeed it seems important for people to seek real relationship s, with at least one person, at least at this time , such as by going for walks together, even if they live as singles. It is particularly depressing to behold what seems to be happening in countries like India, where the exaggerated fear of COVID -19 has led to migrant workers being abruptly dismissed and displaced, without food, without bus and train services, and in danger of dying of hunger and thirst on thei r way to their often distant homes - while avoiding getting infected. M. Foucault 6 has shown how deep the need of human collectives can be for the exclusion of a minority, whether it was lepers, historically followed by psychiatric patients excluded from the community or other, alien, contagious, suspicious and often defenseless minorities. These excesses make it clear that social regression and behavior which, in the face of a potentially fatal danger, deliberately violates elementary fundamental rights o f other people because they are socially weaker, are socially and ethically unsustainable. Especially medicine as a n applied science depends decisively on lived values, because it is always not only about the question of the true - e.g., the specific morta lity of COVID -19 - but also the good. Being ill, especially being seriously ill, requires not only medical but also legal protection. This brings us to the question of rights and of which principles should apply even when life is in danger, and perhaps should continue to claim their validity especially then. The shaping of our interpersonal relationships always moves between proximity and distance, especially in medicine. Human beings have a right to both, if their dignity is to be preserved. Especially whe n they are old, demented or very seriously ill. The final question that can be asked is what sense we can derive from going through this global health crisis. Shortly before the outbreak of the pandemic, Claus Otto Scharmer published the German edition of what he wrote at the beginning in his \"Theory U\": l earning from the past is necessary, but not enough. Disruptive change demands a new approach. \"It requires us to suspend our judgements, redirect our attention, let go of the past, lean into the future that wants to emerge through us, and let it come .\" What wants to emerge? Different air over Wuhan, Milan and Stuttgart? An awareness that our viruses, like our genome, are constantly interacting with what shapes them, namely with the activity and relationship s of living organisms? Meaning that we ourselves are in constant interaction ? An awareness that we have to think, grasp and shape living things anew? A feeling that our earth itself does not only consist of atoms, but encompasses living, feeling and thinki ng beings, on whose behavior all life depends? Could it be that the suffering we inflict on animals (and medicine is heavily involved in this ) is perhaps already having consequences for our own health? That our moral -social 6 Foucault M. 1969. Questions in the SARS -CoV-2 epidemic page 4 of 4 actions have effects down to the level of the microbiome, the virus and the genome? That economy without ecology destroys the house whose laws it is supposedly trying to understand7? When, if not now, is the moment to wake up to the fact that we need a new life science paradigm for research? A n approach to pharmacy and medicine that is ecological . A thinking that is based on mutuality, resonance, on living interaction and not on the will to power, which has its principle of cause in the 'causal', i.e., in compelling cause. Everyone knows that this principle is not suitable as an explanatory pattern for human relationships. Causal thinking is closely linked to degrading others to mere objects . The continuous simultaneous interaction of all living beings, as well as the interaction between the microbiome and the human organism, refuses to accept a one -sided causal approach or corresponding one-sided therapy. This must be kept in mind now also with regard to the idea of vaccination, which is understandably in the foreground at this time. COVID -19 itself is an example of an ecological \"replacement\", as it expands the spectrum of coronaviruses in an unpredictable way , with the consequences that we know. The danger of an epidemic in Germany seemed to have been averted just a moment ago when a new measles protection law took effect - it was a matter of preventing 0 to 1 deaths per year by means of a major government campaign and compulsory vaccination. Even GREEN lawmakers dreamed of a world in which vaccinations would keep us safe from the d anger of all life -threatening infectious diseases. But the world of coronaviruses is as unstable as that of influenza viruses and pneumococci. As reasonable and effective as individual protective vaccinations may be , they are no substitute for an ecologica l perspective and above all for healthy immunological development and nutrition. If the number of type 2 diabetics in India is expected to double to more than 130 million in the next 7 to 10 years, it is clear that no vaccine can help there, but only a radical change in lifestyle and nutrition based on ecological awareness. The example of India also shows that spirituality per se does not necessarily produce new science. For there is no lack of spirituality there. What is needed today is a concrete connecti on between human self -knowledge, daily practice in the fields of thought, relationships and action in connection with a scientific attitude and corresponding research. Anthroposophy offers a comprehensively elaborated methodological approach of this kind . It is important to let anthroposophy become independently fertile in the form of integrative, ecologically and humanely practiced medicine and pharmacy, in a way that is oriented towards the living in research, treatment and health care. Such an approach would take the global responsibility for the future of every human being seriously, as demanded by \"Fridays for Future\". But not from a na\u00efve belief in the science that substantially orchestrated the destructive crises of the 20th and 21st centuries, rather from lively thinking, research and action based on mutual interaction, which takes human being s seriously as the most important global agent s and shaper s, demands comprehensive self-knowledge and promotes health.
