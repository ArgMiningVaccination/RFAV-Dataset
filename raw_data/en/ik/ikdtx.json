While we share the same profession as our colleagues, that's where a lot of the similarity ends. The purpose of this blog is to emphasize a few of these differences. Two Types of Chiropractors A good way to separate chiropractors is into the following two categories: 1) Traditional, \"Philosophy-Based\" Chiropractors (not us) and 2) Progressive, Evidence-Based Chiropractors (totally us). To help differentiate the groups, we're comparing how a chiropractor in each category typically addresses various parts of patient encounters and treatment. Let's get started. Treatment plans Traditional Chiropractic: Often very generic or even the same for every patient (i.e. 3x/week for 1 month, 2x/week for 1 month, 1x/week for 1 month) Evidence Based Chiropractic: Individualized for the patient and their condition (some conditions take only 1-2 visits, same may take up to 12+ visits) Length of Treatment Plans Traditional Chiropractic: Lifelong (Often want you to return even if pain free for \"maintenance\" care) Evidence Based Chiropractic: Treat and release, (\"maintenance\" is staying active, eating healthy and living life). Diagnosis/Classification Traditional Chiropractic: Very general. Often use terms like \"vertebral subluxation complex.\" This is a \"condition\" that has never been proven to exist, and the term is rejected by chiropractic associations in many countries (unfortunately, not the U.S., yet) Evidence Based Chiropractic: Specific to your condition and examination findings. However, it's important to realize that \"diagnosis\" is not as important as a proper classification. See this article: [Have pain? Your diagnosis doesn't matter!](https://activehealthkc.com/pain-diagnosis-doesnt-matter/) Examination Traditional Chiropractic: General, often X-ray of entire body. Or unscientific \"scans\". Evidence Based Chiropractic: Specific to your condition, looking at the area of pain and upstream and downstream of the pain to look at what may have caused the pain. Treatments Traditional Chiropractic: Generally only adjustments Evidence Based Chiropractic: Adjustments, exercise therapy, muscle therapy, nutrition, ergonomics, patient education Reasons for Choosing Treatment Traditional Chiropractic: Doctor's \"philosophy.\" Evidence Based Chiropractic: 1) Patient's needs and goals 2) Research showing which methods are effective Patient's Role In Treatment Plan Traditional Chiropractic: Passive (Doctor treats you) Evidence Based Chiropractic: Active (team approach between Doctor and patient to obtain patient goals) So, there you have it.
