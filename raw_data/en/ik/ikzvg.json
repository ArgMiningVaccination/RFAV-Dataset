Functional medicine practitioners don't treat disease - we treat your body's eco system. We get rid of the bad stuff, put in the good stuff, and because your body is an intelligent system - it does the rest.\"\u2014 Mark Hyman, MD At Balance Atlanta, we see patients of all ages and conditions. The typical client is someone who is seeking a solution to chronic problem where all other methods of treating the condition have failed. When you call Balance Atlanta and schedule an initial visit, our assistant will send by e-mail a functional medicine intake form. If you are interested in chiropractic care or BrainCore Therapy, we will include forms specific to these services. Functional medicine consultations are held at designated times during non-peak office hours to better serve clients. Depending on the complexity of the case, these visits may require 30 to 40 minutes of time. At this appointment, we will determine if functional medicine is right for you. Due to the limited number of available functional medicine appointment times, we require a credit card on file to reserve your visit. Based on your health history, Dr. Caroline will recommend specific labs to be performed. Some tests consist of blood draws at LabCorp. Others require saliva, stool or cheek cell samples which can be taken at home. Requisition forms, tests kits and instructions are available at Balance Atlanta directly. Depending on the test, results are available within 7 - 30 days. Once Dr. Caroline analyzes the data, her assistant will call you to schedule a follow up appointment. She will review the findings in detail in a way that empowers the client to understand their state of health - a collaboration not typical of medical practices. Next, she will make recommendations. While some patients are merely interested in the lab results, others are ready to address their health concerns immediately. The decision is in the hands of the client. Once Balance Atlanta receives your completed patient intake form, our staff will call you to set up the consultation and exam. We now offer complimentary initial phone, Skype or FaceTime consultations to learn more about your needs and to determine if Balance Atlanta is the right fit for you. One you have reserved your visits at the Balance Atlanta office, we require a credit card to hold your appointment as the number of available appointments for new patients is limited. In the case that you must cancel or reschedule your appointment, we require 72-hour advance notice. Our time is as valuable as yours. Failure to do so will result in your card being charged for the full cost of the initial visit. A solid doctor-patient relationship is especially important to practitioners of functional medicine. A comprehensive face-to-face health history review and examination to establish a protocol that will serve the patient's goals. By law, a doctor must meet with a patient in person to provide an initial consultation. Follow-up appointments can be arranged by phone or in the office. If you are (or were) under the care of a medical doctor, nutritionist, or functional medicine practitioner, it is recommended that you mail, fax, or drop off your records for Dr. Caroline to review prior to your first visit. While this is not a requirement, old records can be helpful. If possible, please bring all of your vitamins and other supplements, preferably in the original packaging. Please remember, functional medicine does not replace care with your medical doctors. All recommendations made by your MD, including prescriptions, are to be discussed and managed with your medical doctor. If necessary, Dr. Caroline will consult with your current MD or refer you to an MD for further evaluation. Dr. Caroline is the founder, owner and sole doctor at Balance Atlanta. She believes the personal touch, all-inclusive scope of service under one roof. An intimate environment provides patients with the quality of care that is missing in clinics where most often one is shuffled from one practitioner to the next. You will be working with Dr. Caroline exclusively. With a 5 levels care in one location - chiropractic, functional medicine, BrainCore Therapy, difficult cases, and premium services - Balance Atlanta is a unique resource for health. Testing is frequently done to assess nutritional status including amino acids, fatty acids, oxidative stress, vitamin levels, mitochondrial function, food allergies, and heavy metals. Many other tests are available, including genetic testing for a variety of conditions, hormone evaluations, bone health, gastrointestinal health, adrenal function, and many others. Your current state of health, specific goals, how much testing you want to do, and your budget will be considered when Dr. Caroline suggests a course of action. During your consultation, Dr. Caroline will determine which tests are needed and she will review testing recommendations, instructions and costs. Some testing can be performed at home with test kits to collect urine, saliva or stool. Others may require you to go to a local laboratory such as LabCorp and Any Lab Test to draw the blood. In all cases, we will assist you in coordinating initial and follow-up testing. While the testing gives a more complete picture of your status, effective care can be implemented without it, or testing can be done over time. Balance Atlanta will be notified by the vendor when lab results are available. The turnaround time ranges between seven days and four weeks, depending on the lab. Once the results are in, we will call you to schedule a follow up visit to review the findings. We recommend you share lab test results and the nature of your wellness program with your medical doctor. An integrated approach to health ensures you will receive comprehensive guidance from both allopathic and holistic perspectives. Only your medical doctor can prescribe prescription drugs or adjust dosages. Based on your health profile, Dr. Caroline will make recommendations for nutritional support. This includes dietary modification, detoxification protocols, and the highest quality supplements available only through practitioners of functional medicine. Functional medicine is not covered by insurance. We accept cash, check, credit card, CareCredit, and Health Savings Account funds. All payments are made out-of-pocket. Cost varies based on the severity of the case. While there is certainly a place for allopathic (medical) care in the health matrix, especially in the case of an acute crisis, Dr. Caroline believes preventive wellness care best honors the natural healing capacity of the human body. An integrative approach addresses clean nutrition, mindfulness, having a positive outlook, regular exercise, adequate rest, supportive relationships, and establishing purpose in life. Dr. Caroline welcomes patients who are merely interested in their lab results, as well as people of all ages who are ready to collaborate for the full functional medicine experience at Balance Atlanta. With that said, there are no simple solutions to complex problems. It is essential to remember that your state of health took years, if not decades, to manifest; healing is a process that takes time - there are no quick fixes; genetics, lifestyle, health history, and outlook are factors that affect progress; the likelihood of success depends on your urgency to take action; forming a trusted partnership with Dr. Caroline and other practitioners will support you on the journey; and yes, patients will need to invest time and resources to the project of healing. Dr. Caroline does not diagnose, treat or cure symptoms, sicknesses, or disease. Rather, she interprets the findings of your intake form and lab results. Next, she will create a custom nutrition and lifestyle modification program to support well-being. While we honor the body's incredible ability to heal, we do not guarantee your success. The practice of functional medicine does not replace care from your medical doctor, other specialists in the health field, or the use of prescription drugs. Please inform your medical doctor of all recommendations made by Dr. Caroline. An open dialogue between health professionals is essential to proper patient care. Based on your health history, goals and budget, Dr. Caroline will make specific recommendations within her scope of practice. Options can be scaled to fit your priorities. While some patients request a premium level program, others start on a step-by-step conservative path. Flexibility is the key. Testing can range between $200 for a comprehensive blood panel and urinalysis measuring 80 different markers to a complete lab package in the $5,000 price range. The latter that includes assessing hormones, neurotransmitters, gluten sensitivity, food and chemical allergies, heavy metal toxicity, immune function, the stress response, gut permeability, stool, cardiovascular health, and more. Patients are charged the doctor-wholesale price for labs, thereby saving you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. For instance, a comprehensive bio panel costs you $199. If this test were billed to your insurance by LabCorp, it is now a $2,000 - $3,000 test. By keeping insurance out of the equation, costs to you are reduced. Dr. Caroline does charge clients for her consulting time on an hourly basis. |Lab tests:||Varies based on test| 50-minute follow up lab review:||$300 - $500 depending on case complexity| |Initial nutrition consult, in office or phone, 50 min:||$300| |Nutrition consult, in office or phone, 30 min:||$150| |Supplements, educational materials, support:||Varies based on products| |Complete wellness program to include: testing, consults, phone support, supplements, educational materials, in and out of office experiential collaboration, and more.||Varies based on scope, time frame, goals, severity of health concern.| Please call 404 261 4848 to schedule your initial consultation.
