A strong focus on evidence-based medicine is combined with the philosophical and cultural aspects of tradtional Chinese medicine. Extensive clinical observation and practice is part of the degree, with students having access to RMIT's Health Sciences Clinic and Chinese medicine hospitals overseas. The Master of Applied Science (Acupuncture) qualifies you for registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Undertake Australia's first and only accredited master's degree in acupuncture. Put theory into practice in our Health Sciences Clinic, and the option to practice Chinese medicine in hospitals overseas. Benefit from our strong links with professional bodies and partners in Australia and overseas. Please note that this degree is not available for international students intending to study on a student visa. If you are holding a temporary visa (other than a student visa) and your visa has a full study entitlement, you may be eligible to apply. For more information, see the [international students with other temporary (non-student) visas.](/content/rmit/au/en/study-with-us/international-students/apply-to-rmit-international-students/non-esos.html) You may consider studying the undergraduate [Bachelor of Chinese Medicine (BP278](/content/rmit/au/en/study-with-us/levels-of-study/undergraduate-study/bachelor-degrees/bp278.html) [).](/content/rmit-ui/en/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/mc024.html#_msocom_2) Blended learning incorporates face to face workshops and online teaching. Workshops are run to provide you with a firm theoretical basis, and clinical practice is incorporated to enhance skills and learning. Online materials support students' self-directed learning at your own pace and in your own space. The program emphasises skills to address real patients in clinical settings. The types of classes you have will depend on the course you're studying. Classes are offered in various formats designed to provide meaningful engagement with staff, industry and peers and provide for access and use of spaces where learning can be applied and active, including an array of specialised equipment. Most RMIT courses do not include passive large-scale classes such as lectures, instead the content traditionally provided in lectures is made available online. This may be in the form of readings, videos or other on-demand learning materials. This content will also support the basis of interactive learning that takes place in on-campus classes. RMIT University is committed to providing you with an education that strongly links formal learning with professional or vocational practice. RMIT has strong links with Chinese medicine professional bodies in Australia and internationally, and has national and international teaching and research partners. This is an intensive workshop-based three-year part-time program, designed for practising professionals who want to advance their studies part-time. The program consists of four workshops each year. Each workshop runs for four days. The knowledge and skills you will acquire throughout this degree and how they can be applied in your career are described in the [learning outcomes](http://www1.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=SPGMC024AUSBU;SECTION=2).
