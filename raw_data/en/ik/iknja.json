It is essential that these messages arrive at specific locations, inside of you, throughout your entire life in order for you to remain healthy. The messages travel inside the spinal cord and spinal nerves. The nervous system is like a giant telephone communication network. It transmits electrical messages that directly affect organs, tissues and cells in the body and it can also trigger the release of chemical messages that allow other modes of communication to take place within our physiology. Whether it's electrical or chemical communications, the nervous system is behind the transmission of these messages and your body cannot be healthy if the nervous system is not functioning properly. The spinal cord is very well protected by the spinal bones and the brain is protected by the skull. Spinal bones (vertebrae) are moveable structures and they allow us a great deal of flexibility when we are moving about. Because the spinal bones sit on top of one another, they form a long canal of bones where the spinal cord runs through. The spinal nerves that exit off the spinal cord pass between openings that are made on the sides of the spinal bones. Sometimes spinal bones become misaligned from each other and this causes them to place a slight amount of pressure on the spinal nerves (vertebral subluxations). When this happens, the messages that are being transmitted through the nervous system become distorted and this causes problems to occur in the body's physiology.

[This is not done to treat specific conditions of sickness or disease,](http://www.amazon.com/Chiropractic-Made-Simple-John-Reizer/dp/1589610393/ref=sr_1_13?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1334109483&sr=1-13) but rather to correct the misaligned (subluxated) spinal bones. The spinal adjustments help to remove nerve interference and this ultimately allows health to be restored in the body naturally. Many conditions of sickness are then reversed by the body's own inborn recuperative abilities. "}
