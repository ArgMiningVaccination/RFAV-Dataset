Reading books about spirituality can open your heart to things you've always felt, or expand your thinking to include ideas you never dared to explore. Oprah has long talked about the impact of books by such thought leaders as Eckhart Tolle, Martha Beck, Bren\u00e9 Brown, Elizabeth Lesser, Mark Nepo, and so many others that have helped her through crises, guided her through transitions, and sometimes...blown her mind. Are you living with purpose? Are you cultivating empathy and connection? Can you sit with stillness? Can you process and move on from trauma, into strength? And can you even nourish your sense of the numinous, i.e. connect more deeply with the divinity within and around you? These are some of the essential questions these titles explore and provide pathways to. Each of the recent offerings we highlight here\u2014from memoir to literary fiction to poetry to romance novels\u2014illuminates something about how individuals and communities conceive of and get proximity to the spiritual. That might entail praying in churches or temples or mosques with others, or it might mean being in nature. For scientists, the sublime might be found in conducting research leading to a breakthrough. And for others, it might mean letting the traditions of their childhood lead them to love when all else seems lost. So take some time to delve into these books on spirituality, to discover the numinous in your life and how you can access it. These books will surprise you, making you change the way you think about everything\u2014 politics, humanity, nature, music, pop culture, and even (perhaps especially) yourself.
