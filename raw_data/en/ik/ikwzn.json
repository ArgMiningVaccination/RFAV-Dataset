Course Policies : Attendance: Students are expected to attend all their scheduled classes and laboratories and not to be absent without adequate reason. Deficiency in any required work resulting from absence from class must be made up to the satisfaction of the instructor. A student who is absent from a course without adequate reason may be assigned a failing grade. Students who are registered a s Auditors are subject to the same attendance regulations as those registered for credit. Those Auditors who are reported for their excessive absence from class will receive a grade of LW in the course. In inclement weather, when classes have not been cancelled, students should notify their faculty promptly if they are unable to attend class, as described in the policies on Holding Classes and Inclement Weather. For full attendance policy, please visit the following website: 5 http://academiccatalog.udel.edu/Pub_ShowCatalogPage.aspx?CATKEY=ROOT&ACYEAR=20 15-2016&DSPL=Published Introduction to the course : This course is taught in a \"flipped co urse\" style. This format allows for consistent lecture s across all sections AND allows professors to work directly with students in smaller lab classes each week as they learn assessment techniques . The lectures have been taped . It is the responsibility of the student to view the lectures and read the chapters prior to attending each of the lab class es. Each lab class will have less than 18 students . The lab instructor will be there to guide practice , reinforce content in video lectures, answer questi ons, and evaluate student's assessment skills . Ingrid Pretzer -Aboff and Donna Szewczyk who coordinate this course are available for guidance, questions, and assistance with any aspect of this course . Please feel free to contact us. Course Requirements : 1. Check your UD e -mail and NURS253 Sakai homepage for announcements regularly. 2. Didactic: Attend ing the first day of class (orientation ) and all test sessions detailed on the course sche dule below is MANDATORY. Viewing videos and read ing the corresponding c hapter each week prior to your lab class is MANDATORY. 3. Lab Class : Attend ing your lab class each week is MANDATORY. You will work with a pa rtner as you practice assessment skills . Bring the course textbook, dual -head stethoscope, and wear the UD name tag in lab each week . Bring a copy of test -out forms each week, & handouts for weeks 2 , 3, 4, 8 , & 9 to lab . Wear clothing conducive to having a physical exam in the patient role. For final test - out wear scrub s for the nurse role and bring clothing conducive to a physical exam for the patient role (e.g. tank top and shorts). Study Tips/Learning Resources: An advantage of the flipped course style is that you can schedule your video viewing and readings at a tim e in the week that works for you. It is most helpful to stick to a schedule d time in your week to review the videos and read ings. A mistake students sometimes make is to put this off until the days before a test. This would not be beneficial or conducive to learning this very important material. The exams are largely based on the content in the Jarvis text. If you need assistance in organizing your studies or have any concerns ple ase contact us. 6 Grading Policy: The following criteria will be used to determine course grades: Weekly lab test -outs: Students must satisfactorily pass the \"Weekly test -out of practicum \" in order to obtain a passing grade in the course. If a student fails a test -out, only one repeat is permitted; a second failure in the same test-out will result in failure of the course. Comprehensive health assessment test -out: Students are required to pass the comprehensive health assessment test -out demonstration with a 70% grade. If a grade is less than 70%, only one additional test -out is permitted; 2 failures in the comprehensive test -out demonstration will result in failure of the course. Grading Scale: 100 - 93.34 = A 79.99 - 63.33 - 60.00 = D - 93.33 - 90.00 = A - 76.66 - 73.34 = C <60------------ = F 89.99 - 86.67 = 73.33 - = 69.99 - 66.67 = - 80.00 = B - 66.66 - 63.34 = D Course Assignments & Evaluation Methods : Due Dates % course grade ATTENDANCE / WEEKLY ROS / PREPARATION Attendance and lab preparation: weekly 5% Weekly Review of Systems (ROS) write -up Write up starting with General Survey , V/S, pain and ending with neurological assessment.

While on excursions it is also mandatory that students take safety precautions regarding sun protection. 6 2. Reflectiv e Journaling: Guidelines/Format: Journaling will be a big part of your course grade while in the British and US Virgin Islands. You are free to write in your journal any way you choose to reflect your experiences. You may be as creative as you so desire. Students are required to submit electronic journals (as email attachments) to the instructor. The purpose of the excursions and service learning site entries is to stimulate critical thinking as students examine the experiences. The ability to reflect upon experiences has been shown to predict levels of critical thinking in practice. Therefore, students should analyze their placement site experience and not merely provide a description of the site. Prior to boarding plane Entry #1: a) Please discuss your expectations and any thoughts about going to the BVI. What are you most excited about? What do you hope to learn from this trip? What are you most concerned about? b) What are your current thoughts regarding race relations in the USA? Do you think what you feel and think will be prese nt in the BVI and USVI? How do you think it will be similar or different? Explain your reasoning and thoughts...Please be completely open and honest. Entry # 2: Site discussion: Provide the following information (a guideline of things to consider): a) A description of the experience including what you did and saw. What kind of unit were you on, how many patients do they care for, was it small, adequately staffed, etc. Feel free to add what you want. b) What is the nurses' role on the unit, what is their s cope of practice, and their interactions with doctors? c) Your reactions, feelings, desires, and thoughts about your day. d) What was learned from your experience? e) How were you accepted by the patients, their families, and staff? f) As you change sites, please d iscuss the differences between them, rural vs. urban, what is their patient population, any differences in practice. g) In addition, discuss one particular patient you were involved with. What kind of nursing/medical care was provided, what cultural issues did you note that differ from the US, what differences in practice from the US did you notice (answer if you can), what are routines of care in your unit, what was your involvement if any. If allowed access to the charts, look at medical and social history, any labs and possible Significance, any test results, current medications, reason for admission, vital signs, etc. h) Reflect on unique aspects of the culture as it relates to health care services provided in the United States as well as your own personal cultural experiences in the health care system. Please include a description and analysis of how the experience provided an opportunity for growth and development in the role of the professional nurse. 7 Entry # 3: a) Pronovost, P., & Vohr, E. (2010). Safe patients, smart hospitals: How one doctor's checklist can help us change health care from the inside out . New York: Hudson Street Press. b) Kohn, L. (1999). To err is human: Building a safer health system . Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. (found on Course Sakai Site) c) Josie King Video found on UD Capture https://udcapture.udel.edu/2016f/nurs460/ This book, the Josie King Video and the IOM report will provide a view of how we as health care providers are confronting and attempting to find answers to safety issues within the healthcare arena. As you read the book and view the video, think about the culture of the people and hospital. Also think about how the nurses and other healthcare provide rs make decisions in the BVI. As you review all this material, please journal about the following: 1. Are the nurses and healthcare providers making sound decisions based on research? Is it evidence based? If the healthcare providers were confronted with a procedure to be completed that they were unfamiliar with or a medication they did not know, what would be their method of accomplishing this (your thoughts based on observations)? Give examples of what you have observed or conversations you have had. 2. What are your thoughts on \"googling information\" as a means to sorting out how a medication works (risks, side effects etc) or how to complete a procedure you are unfamiliar with? 3. Is there adequate staffing, educational resources and equipment to carry out the healthcare providers jobs? 4. On a day to day basis, how easy is it for a nurse and healthcare providers to locate appropriate educational resources? 5. What is the culture of the team in the BVI? Is there a culture that supports teamwork where there is \"wisdom of the team.\" 6. How are errors handled in the BVI healthcare arena? Is the culture non -punitive or is there a blame game culture? 7. If you were the president of the hospital or president of nursing what one area of concern or \"opportunity for improvement\" have you identified in the BVI healthcare system? Knowing change and cultural issues can influence how change occurs, how would you go about making the system better? Be specific about what area you think could be improved and how you would go about as a change agent. How does what you now know about the culture, influence some of your specific suggestions in your \"opportunity for improvement?\" 3. Group Project - Diseases then and now (2 students per group) ~Total slide count: 8 - 10 slides (no more or less). This means you should have 6 - 8 slides with content, then you will have 2 slides left over - one should be your title side and the other the citation/bibliography slide. This will give you a 10 minute talk. Remember, you do not have to put all your information on the slides. You should hold some information back to discuss with the class. ~When making your slides, remember the class (and those grading you) should be able to read your slides. There should be a balance between text and photo ~You want to avoid \"dark backgrounds\" with \"dark lettering\", very hard to see 8 ~Your font on the slides should be large (20 -24). Avoid font styles that are hard to read/fancy. All citations must be in APA for matting 1) Pick a Disease in the Caribbean that occurred between the 1400's and modern day 2) Your content slides should contain information about your disease: what does it look like, how is spread (person- to-person, animal to person, or insect to person, wh at is the incidence)? 3) Is your disease viral, bacterial or something else? Is there a host for your disease (if available)? What is the incubation time? Is there different variation of your disease? What is the life cycle (if available)? 4) Can it be cured or is it fatal? What is the prevention plan? If it can be cured what it the treatment plan? If it is fatal what is the survival rate? Who does the disease affects (adults, children, rich or poor)? 5) Moreover, where in the world does it occur? Doe s it cause a physical disability or death? What is the impact on the community? 6) Some of you have diseases that have shaped our history, so you can use historical resources to gather information. Has this disease been eradicated? If so when? 7) Additional Facts You should use pictures/charts to help you explain.

How do the USVI and British Virgin Islands meet the healthcare needs of their population? Are there areas or populations who you would consider vulnerable populations at risk? Are the islanders doing anything to resolve these problems? From your personal experience in the sites do you have any suggestions to address and improve on the health care services you saw? Are there any cultural issues you see that impact these problems and the resolution of t hem? When you speak to health care providers and patients, how do they describe how far have they come? What do you see that still needs to happen? Look at the healthcare services and needs of the people you met, what are the similarities and what are the differences? 1 UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE - SCHOOL OF NURSING College of Health Sciences NURS 453 - Clinical Applications: Adult Health Nursing I General Syllabus Course Description: This course is the clinical application of science and nursing theories of care for adult clients in hospitals.

Some assignments may be submitted via email to your clinical instructor as a PDF or Word document when directed. Grading for late assignments will be reduced by 20% each 24 hou rs that the assignment is late, unless discussed prior to the due date/time . ***Students are expected to complete tests and quizzes on the scheduled date. Make up tests and quizzes will be given ( in essay format ) at the discretion of the faculty (during final week of class), given prior notice of student inability to attend class on the test/quiz date. ***Testing Procedures: The following testing procedures have been designated by the course coordinator and are subject to change/be altered or added to at the discretion of the course coordinator at any point during the duration of the semester. 1. Seating for testing is every other seat, every other row as the assigned room allows. 2. No belongings may be kept at one's desk, except laptop and appropriate cords and cables. 3. No hats, jackets, or hoodies may be worn during testing. 4. Assigned or randomly assigned seating may take place. 5. All cell phones must be out (visible), turned off, and placed face down on the desk directly in front of the student. 6. Students may be expected to sign an honor code prior to each test. 7. Students must wear name tags during tests. Violations of any testing procedures may be considered a breach in testing ethics. Direct Patient Care Pass/Fail Direct patient care experiences in clinical settings and clinical simulation in the simulation lab and skills lab will be graded Pass/Fail. To determine whether or not the student achieved the course clinical competencies, the instructor will evaluate the student's performance when caring for patients in the clinical setting, skills lab, and simulation. Students must meet the competencies consis tently in all five threads of clinical performance (critical thinking, nursing intervention, professional role, caring and communication) to pass the course. Obtaining a \"not met\" in any one of the five threads at the final evaluation will constitute a fai lure within the course. Attendance at clinical/skills lab/simulation/small group is mandatory. Failure to attend any one of these activities places the student in jeopardy of failing the course . Failure to contact clinical instructor prior to absence, may result in failure of the course. I f an absence is unavoidable, the student is expected to contact their clinical instructor prior to the absence and work directly with the clinical instructor to arrange make -up. **Students are expected to follow the W VU School of Nursing Standards of Professional Practice. Violations of these standards will be dealt with in accordance with the policy and procedure outlined in the Undergraduate Student Handbook. Grade Scale : Percent 93 - 100 A 85 - 92 B 77 - 84 C 70 - 76 D 69 - below F Grading Policy : In order to pass the course, students must: 1. Achieve a cumulative average of 77% on Exams/Tests. 2. Achieve a cumulative average of 77% on all graded assignments. West Virginia University School of Nursing 3. Pass all threads in the direct patient care component of the course. If the overall grade average for the course is a \"C\" or better but student: 1. Fails to achieve a 77% on the overall test average, or 2. Fails to achieve a 77% on the overall graded assignments, or 3. Fails to pass the direct ca re clinical portion of the course, then the course grade will be a \"D\" regardless of the overall average . Professional Conduct: The role of the professional nurse involves demonstrating attitudes, values, personal qualities and behaviors consistent with p rofessional nursing practice. In the classroom and clinical settings, an environment conducive to learning is fostered through mutual respect among students and faculty. Students displaying behaviors that are inconsistent with professionalism or that det ract from the learning environment will be asked to leave class or clinical, and will not receive credit for any activities completed during the class or clinical experience. Students will turn off and refrain from accessing all personal communication dev ices while in class or clinical. In order to avoid distraction to other students, and to maintain safety and confidentiality, students may not bring family members (including children) or friends with them to class without prior approval from the instructor and only when there are extenuating circumstances. Family members (including children) or friends are not allowed in the clinical area. Children may not be left unsupervised in waiting areas in the Health Sciences Center or clinical agencies. Behaviors that Constitute Immediate Clinical Failure : Unprofessional Unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information Failure to maintain professional boundaries Threatening behavior or harassment Commitment of an act which could adversely affec t the physical or psychological welfare of a patient Abandonment of patients by terminating responsibility for nursing care without properly notifying appropriate personnel and ensuring the safety of patients Practicing beyond the scope of the student role Refusal to follow appropriate directives or instructions from faculty or nursing personnel Willful neglect to perform assigned work Willful violation of clinical agency policies Unethical Dishonest behavior, including but not limited to giving false repor ts, falsifying documentation, and theft Willful misuse, destruction, or damage to property Unsafe Reporting for clinical or practicing nursing when not fit for duty due to the use or abuse of alcohol, drugs, prescription medicines or other controlled subst ance. Possession of alcohol or illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia while on duty. Practicing nursing while the ability to safely and effectively practice is compromised by physical or mental disability or lack of sleep Lack of preparation that significantly compromises patient safety Academic Integrity : The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud.

Grades on out of class assignments/papers are added to the final grade after a minimum average of 70% has been achieved on exams and quizzes. This does not include ATI exams. Students who earn a course grade lower than a \"C\" will not progress to the next clinical course. 2. Attendance of all skills labs and clinical sessions is required. See policy later in this document. In cases of emergency ( accident, death, or documented illness), it is the student's responsibility to notify the clinical faculty if she/he is going to be absent from or late to the clinical setting. Please refer to the section on \"POLICY FOR MISSED, MAKE -UP EXAMS & ON (SKILLS L ABORATORY) / OFF CAMPUS CLINICAL SESSIONS.\" 3. Satisfactory performance evaluation on three Observed Structured Clinical Exams (OSCE). If a satisfactory is not achieved, the following procedure will apply: a. Student will request a remediation appo intment with skills lab coordinator within 2 days to develop a remediation plan. b. Student will request a repeat testing appointment with skills lab coordinator within 2 days. c. If student is unsuccessful after 3rd attempt, no remediation is offered, and stude nt will fail the course. 4. Students are responsible for ensuring their health clearance is complete prior to the beginning of clinical. Students will not be permitted to attend clinical if health clearance remains incomplete. 5. Students are expected to demonstrate professional behaviors including professional demeanor, positive contribution in lab, respect for others, and interpersonal skills consistent with personal accountability and professional integrity. Students should arrive in the lab and clinical setting on time and be prepared to work. Failure to comply with the above may result in dismissal from lab or the clinical setting and count as an absence for the day . Up to 10 points may be deducted from final course grade for professional miscond uct. The following rubric will be used: Clinical tardiness 4 or more times, inappropriate use of electronic devices more than once; failure to follow faculty instructions while in the clinical or lab setting more than 1 time; or rudeness or incivility to an instructor, hospital staff person, or peer 1 time; or inappropriate dress more than 1 time = 20 points off and possible clinical failure. Tardiness to clinical 3 times = 10 points off final grade Tardiness to clinical 2 times = 5 points off final grade 6. Preparation for all clinical lab sessions is required. Students are to review objectives and applicable readings, vocabulary and procedures for on -campus clinical experiences in addition to watching all assigned FA Davis skills videos. This preparation is to be completed prior to lab. 7. No phone calls or texting in the skills lab or clinical setting. Smartphone use in clinical and lab should be restricted to access of references except during designated breaks. 8. Students are required to arrive to the clinical setting prepare to perform all fundamental skills as taught in skills lab. Faculty may prohibit any student deemed ill prepared to meet objectives and/or provide safe care from participating in clinical experiences. 9. Proper uniform and profess ional attire (scrubs) with nametags will be worn any time the student is in the classroom, lab and clinical settings. When preparing for clinical and not directly participating in the care of patients, lab coats with professional business casual (closed -toed shoes, no shorts or cutoffs) must be worn with appropriate identification. 10. Achievement of satisfactory rating for clinical experiences is required. An unsatisfactory evaluation in clinical practice results in course failure regardless of progress in the didactic portion of the course . A student who fails a clinical session will receive an F in the course, irrespective of previous or subsequent test grades. 11. Completion of a careplan on an assigned patient and thorough clinical knowledge of eac h assigned patient each week of hospital clinical. One completed clinical careplan will be submitted for a grade. (Please see Policy on Student Preparation for Clinical Experiences posted on Canvas.) 12. Participation in clinical self- evaluation and cour se evaluation at the conclusion of the semester. 13. Completion of two posted ATI Practice tests. Students must achieve a score of 70% on the ATI Practice tests before the proctored test can be taken. Students may need to take the practice tests multiple times in order to achieve 70% (see ATI Policy). 14. Completion of one ATI Proctored test, which will count towards 10% of the final grade. A student who has not met the requirements of the ATI practice test cannot sit for the proctored test. This will result in a grade of \"0\" for the grade percentage for the proctored ATI test. A student who does not achieve a score of 70% on the proctored exam must complete a focused review (see ATI Policy Statement below). 15. Achievement of a score of 90% on the do sage calculation quiz. If the first attempt is unsuccessful, a second quiz will be taken after the student completes remediation. The course coordinator will determine the date of the second quiz. All students must achieve a score of 90% in order to pass the course and advance in the program. Students will not be allowed to administer medications until this 90% has been achieved. ON-CAMPUS CLINICAL (SKILLS LABORATORY): The on -campus clinical (laboratory) component of this course is designed to simulate a hospitalized patient situation as closely as possible. For this reason, the following student behaviors will be expected while in the clinical laboratory: 1. Preparation for each lab experience includes review of lab objectives, reading assignments and FA Davis Modules. 2. Nursing school uniforms (scrubs) with nametag will be worn in the laboratory at all times. These should be clean and wrinkle free.

The two paper grades will be averaged f or the final paper grade but cannot receive higher than a 75. (Papers with a grade of 75 or higher may not have a second read requested.) If the averaged paper grade is a 74 or less, the student will be required to re -write the paper. The grade of the re written paper will represent the final paper grade and may not exceed 75. ATI POLICY STATEMENT: Overview ATI is a comprehensive package designed to assist students in learning the information needed to provide safe, effective patient care and successfully pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX), the core requirement for practicing as a registered nurse. ATI materials and assessments should be considered supplementary and complementary to content taught in the classroom. As with all testin g in the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, students are expected to abide by the honor system when taking ATI tests whether supervised by a faculty member or not. By signing the Honor Code pledge for the School and the profession of nursing, it is e xpected that students will remain ethical in all aspects of professional student life and their future professional careers. Students are: 1. required to take both practice assessments associated with each proctored assessment. 2. required to access their indiv idualized ATI Focused Review and spend at least one hour reviewing content after taking each practice assessment. 3. encouraged to review content and retake practice assessments until they earn a score of 80% or greater; however, retaking practice assessments without reviewing content is not recommended. Students may retake practice assessments multiple times and continue to review content via Focused Reviews. Scores on practice assessments will not count toward course grades. Verification that students have taken both practice assessments and completed at least one hour of Focused Review for each practice assessment is required before students will be allowed to take the proctored assessment. Failure to take a proctored assessment or required retake will resu lt in a grade of zero for the assessment. Each proctored assessment counts at 10% of overall course grade. Grades for proctored assessments are assigned as follows: Proctored ATI Assessment Score Grade Focused Review built from Proctored Assessment Retake Proctored Assessment Level 3 90% + 10 points Minimum one hour No retake Level 2 80% + 9 points Minimum one hour May earn 1 additional point if Level 3 achieved on optional retake Level 1 70% REQUIRED + 9 points Minimum two hours REQUIRED May earn 1 additional point if Level 2 or 3 achieved on retake Below Level 1 60% REQUIRED + 9 points Minimum three hours REQUIRED May earn 1 additional point if Level 1 achieved on retake or 11 additional points if Level 2 or 3 achieved on retake All students are strongly encouraged to complete Focused Reviews after taking a proctored assessment in preparation for the NCLEX, regardless of score earned. Students earning a Level 1 or Below Level 1 on retake will work with faculty to create an individualized remediation plan. Remediation It is strongly recommended that students do Focused Review for any proctored assessment taken in a previous course on which you earned below a Level 2 in order to strengthen your ability to do well on the Comprehensive Predictor and subsequently NCLEX. ATI testing comprises 3 components: (1) Practice Tests, (2) Proctored Tests, and (3) Focused Remediation Practice Tests For this course 2 practice tests (see assignments and dates in the syllabus) must be completed and a percent grade of 70% achieved before the proctored test can be taken. This may mean that you, the student, will need to take the test multiple times to achieve this goal. This also means that you should not wait until the evening before the proctored test to begin the practice tests. Plan accordingly. A minimum of 70% is required to be eligible to sit for the proctored examination. Faculty will print a report the day of the test to be certain the student achieves the 70% before they sit for the proctored exam. There will be a one -hour lock out window between practice tests to give you time to review and study the material that you did not know. Rationales will be available for practice tests 3 days prior to the proctored assessment. All practice tests must be com pleted prior to the scheduled day of the proctored test. Proctored Test The proctored test for the course will be given on an assigned day (see syllabus). Students must have the practice tests completed prior to the date of the scheduled proctored exam. A student who has not met the requirements of the practice test will be prohibited from sitting for the proctored test. This will result in a grade of \"0\" for the grade percentage for the proctored ATI test. POLICY FOR MISSED, MAKE -UP EXAMS & ON (SKILLS LABORATORY) / OFF CAMPUS CLINICAL SESSIONS: Students who expect to be absent from a scheduled course exam or quiz must notify the Course Coordinator of the impending absence at a minimum of one hour prior to the scheduled exam or quiz. Notification may be in the form of a telephone call, voice message or an email. Students who are absent from a scheduled course exam or quiz must supply acceptable documentation to support their absence (for example, a primary care provider's note, an obituary or an acciden t report) to the Course Coordinator. Students who supply acceptable documentation will be eligible to make up the missed exam or quiz. The Course Coordinator will assign a make -up date and time. Students who do not provide acceptable documentation to sup port their absence will receive a grade of zero for the test. Students who fail to take the make- up test at the scheduled date and time will receive a grade of zero for the test. Students who wish to appeal a grade of zero for a missed test or make -up te st should be prepared to supply acceptable documentation, as noted above, to support their appeal to the Course Coordinator and the BSN Program Director. Attendance is required for all on and off campus clinical sessions. It is important that students not come to clinical if they sick (i.e. vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or major coughing in within 24 hours prior to clinical. Written documentation of illness from a licensed healthcare provider should be provided to the assigned clinical instructor within 72 hours of missed clinical day. On Campus Clinical (Skills Laboratory): If an emergency (accident, death, or documented illness) causes an absence from lab, students must notify the course coordinator or skills lab coordinator immediately and before the lab. The lab coordinator will schedule any make -up labs. Students w ho cannot attend the scheduled make- up lab will have 10 points deducted from their final lab grade. Labs cannot be made up without prior faculty approval. Excused absences for illness will be rescheduled with the individual clinical instructor (and may be substituted with on -campus clinical experiences), but are highly discouraged. Unexcused absences from clinical may jeopardize a student's ability to pass the clinical component of this course and will not be rescheduled.

COURSE DESCRIPTION: Health Assessmen t (N380) has been designed to provide the beginning level knowledge and psychomotor skills necessary for assessing the health status of clients. Students will use the nursing process framework to elicit health histories and perform physical examinations in a systematic manner and to determine areas in which health promotion activities should be implemented or reinforced. The influence of developmental stage, psychosocial factors, environment, and self -care practices will be examined in the context of an individual's health. Students will be introduced to a broad range of normal variations through supervised practice on peers in the laboratory setting. Further application will occur within concurrent and subsequent clinical nursing courses. CURRICULAR THREADS: This course addresses the NHWSN curricular concept threads of ethics/social responsibility, patient and family centered care, informatics, and teamwork and collaboration. COURSE OBJECTIVES: 1. Demonstrate ability to collect a comprehensive health history from a client. 2. Recognize the influence of developmental stage, lifestyle practices, cultural practices and psychosocial factors in the context of an individual's health. 3. Identify modifiable and non -modifiable risk factors associated with health p romotion and disease prevention and management. 4. Utilize principles and techniques of physical examination for health assessment of clients. 5. Demonstrate understanding of the relationship of the health history to the physical examination. 6. Record and accurately report historical and physical examination data using correct terms and format. 7. Integrate health assessment into the assessment component of the nursing process.

Undergraduate Curriculum Macro -Concepts -Safety Safety and security are basic human needs. Safety, freedom from danger, harm, or risk, is a responsibility of all health care providers. It is important to focus on a culture of safety that promotes safe, effective, person -centered delivery of care (IOM, 2 000). This is accomplished through focus on: Safety - avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them. Effective - providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit. Patient -centered - providing care that is respectful of and responsive to patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.

Equitable - providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, geog raphic location, and socioeconomic status ( IOM, 2001 ) -Oxygenation, Ventilation, Circulation and Perfusion Ventilation: The movement of air between the atmosphere and alveoli and the distribution of air within the lungs to maintain appropriate concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. The process of ventilation occurs through inspiration and expiration. Oxygenation: The process of providing life -sustaining oxygen to the body's cells. Perfusion: The adequacy of blood flow through the vasculature to maintain function at the cellular level. Circulation: continuous one -way circuit of blood through the blood vessels, with the heart as the pump; the flow of blood through arteries and capillaries, oxygenated capillary blood and nutrients pass through body tissues, and removal of cellular waste products -Nurse Patient Relationship The core of nursing. Fundamental to this relationship is the establishment of trust. The relationship exists to meet the biological, psychological, spiritual, cultural and health needs of the patient. The word patient includes individuals and communities. -Ingestion, Digestion, Absorption and Elimination Ingestion: Taking in food or drink for the purpose of digestion and absorption Digestion: The process by which food is physically and chemical broken down into smaller particles for absorption into the body Absorption: the uptake of substances into or across tissues; transfer of nutrients into the circulation . Elimination: Elimination of undigested waste material via the gastrointestinal tract -Adaptation The adjustment of living with other living things and internal and external environmental conditions. The human body can adapt to changes in the internal and external environment with a variety physiological and psychosocial responses. -Urinary Function The elimination of body waste products and materials that exceed bodily needs via the urinary system. -Movement and Sensory Input Purposeful physical mobility; functioning of one or more senses; the body's abi lity to receive and process data from internal and external environment -Roles of the Professional Nurse Multiple kinds of consumers as well as a variety of settings (hospitals, clinics, communities) require that nurses assume different roles. Key roles of the nurse may include provider of care, educator, advocate, counselor, coach, manager, researcher, collaborator, change agent, leader, and entrepreneur.

The Universi ty offers a wide array of undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs. Currently, Bowie State University serves a diverse student population, providing educational opportunities that enable students to function in a technological and interdependent worl d. The University continues to honor its commitment to providing access to higher education for under represented populations, with a commitment to African Americans. The University remains a leader in graduating African Americans in technological fields. There are four academic colleges: Education, Arts and Sciences, Professional Studies, Business, and the Graduate School. Each college and the Graduate School has a Dean who reports to the Provost and Vice -President of Academic Affairs. Bowie State University fosters a supportive, rigorous, and collaborative environment that nurtures excellence in academics and in professional and cross cultural relationships. The University places particular emphasis on excellence in teaching methodology and researc h to improve the teaching learning process. Bowie State University produces graduates who are leaders among their peers in a global community, who think critically, who value diversity, and who are committed to high moral standards. The University is commi tted to diversity by recruiting and retaining students from various groups who demonstrate excellence in leadership qualities, display academic potential, and exhibit the motivation to learn. The University delivers instruction to a global audience of adul t learners through the use of technology and incorporation of new teaching pedagogy. Bowie State University is a leader in the infusion of technology into the curriculum while maintaining its role as an institution grounded in the liberal arts. The Univers ity is committed to providing a high quality education that fosters learning and enhances skill acquisition and knowledge discovery based on proven pedagogies and an up todate curriculum for students at all levels. The University offers a comprehensive se t of undergraduate programs that include the arts and humanities, business and management, teacher education, science and technology, and health and human services. The Department of Nursing (DON) is one of four departments in the College of Professional S tudies (CPS). The other departments in the CPS include Social Work, Psychology, and Behavioral Sciences and Human Services. Each department has a chair and faculty organization. The chair of each department reports to the Dean of the CPS, who reports to th e Provost of the University. There has bee n a recent change in the CPS Admin istrative leadership. The former Dean c ompleted his tenure as Dean in December 2016. The new CPS I nterim Dean assumed his role and responsibilities in January 2017. In addition, the current President of the University , Dr. Mickey Burnim, has tendered his resignation effective June 30, 2017. The University has initiated the se arch committee process to fill both of these positions prior to the start of the Fall 2017 semes ter. 3 The (DON) offers a Bachelor's of Science in Nursing a traditional program format (four - year), RN to BS, and the Accelerated Baccalaureate Nursing Program. The Accelerated program was implemented in June 2009. Since 2004, student enrollment in the undergraduate nursing program has quadrupled. As of Fall 2016 we are servicing 541 undergraduate students enrolled on a full -time or part-time basis. Based on student self - reporting, mo re than half of the department students are African American and one -fourth are African. The majority of the students are between the ages of 25 and 40. These students represent the constituents of the metropolitan Baltimore/Washington, D.C. and Virginia communities. The DON has fourteen (14) full -time undergraduate faculty t eaching the core courses and fifteen (15) part -time adjunct clinical instructors and three (3) part -time adjunct classroom instructors in the undergraduate program . The DON has documented a variety of challenges over the past 10 years, most notably with regard to its low NCLEX -RN pass rates. Many of these challenges can be attributed, at least in part, to the significant turnover in both the department faculty and Administrative Head. Since 2008/2009 the Department has had six different Nurse Administr ators and a consistent need to hire faculty replacements and/or seek new additions for specialty area faculty positions. This turn -over has contributed to the continuing low pass rates on the NCLEX -RN examinations, and a heightened sense of anxiety through out the department at all levels, resulting in many resignations. The current Administrator, Dr. Rena Boss -Victoria, began her leadership of the program in August 2015. Since that time two primary goals have been to establish stability within the Departm ent of Nursing through the hiring of six new faculty members and several administrative staff, and to establish a renewed focus on updating the policies related to student admissions, progression and graduation outcomes. Both of these goals have met with success and have brought the department closer to meeting the requirements for quality nursing education. For example, although we did not meet the State standard for the 2016 NCLEX -RN pass rate, there was a significant increase in the Department's pass r ate from 41.1% in 2015 to 71.0% in 2016. History of the Department of Nursing The Department of Nursing was established in 1979 with a program of study offering the Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science (RN -BS) nursing completion program. It was the only freestanding RN - BSN program in Maryland. In 1989 the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) program was established. In 2002, the generic Baccalaureate Nursing Program was initiated and accepted the first students in the following fall semester. The BSN program received full accreditation from NLNAC in 2004, and in 2009. With the exception of the RN to BSN undergraduate nursing students, the nursing students follow a full-time progression plan; the RN to BSN progression plan maybe full -time or part -time. The faculty believes that undergraduate education builds upon the generalist foundation of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing Essentials of Baccalaureate Education to prepare nurses for practice and leadership roles. Undergraduate educa tion provides the student with opportunities to develop expertise and specialized knowledge in the care of clients and populations. The undergraduate program is organized using 4 core, supporting, and specialty content. Undergraduate nursing education incorp orates evidence -based practice that enables nurses to participate in health policy development, research, health promotion, and management, with emphasis on diverse and vulnerable populations. The curriculum is guided by organizations such as the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) Essentials of Baccalaureate Education, Standards and Criteria of the Accrediting Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) and the Maryland Board of Nursing (MBON). Students are admitted into the baccalaureate nur sing program in one of four options/tracks : Traditional (4 years) : Designed for freshman students who have completed the required general education courses to become eligible for admission Accelerated transfer (18 months) : A rapid -paced degree program for students who have completed some college courses Accelerated second degree (18 months) : A rapid -paced degree program for students who have already earned a bachelor's degree RN to BSN (12-18 months) : Designed for students who have an associate's degree in nursing and are moving forward to earn their bachelor's degree COMAR 10.27.03. 04 Philosophy and Objectives, Outcomes, or Competencies The BSN nursing curriculum is developed and implemented based on the faculty's beliefs about professional nursing education and professional nursing practice, the nature of the client, health, and the environment. In order to meet the current and future needs of global communities, professional nursing education must prepare graduates to provide therapeutic and culturally congruent care in a variety of settings. Professional nursing education encourages the development of caring behaviors, therapeutic communication, cultural competence, social awareness and collaborative skills that facilitat e academic and personal development. The faculty believes professional nursing education prepares learners to think critically, to apply clinical reasoning, to adapt to technological changes, and to pursue continued education as a goal directed lifelong process. The mission, vision, philosophy , and program outcomes are published on the BSU website: https://www.bowiestate.edu/academics -research/colleges/college -of- professional -studie/departments/nursing/ . BSN Program Student Learning Outcomes Upon completion of the Undergraduate Nursing Program, the graduate will be able to: 1. Implement nursing pro cesses and caring behaviors to individuals, families, and communities. 2. Use communication, technology, and collaborative skills to provide safe and effective care. 3. Apply culturally congruent care for clients across the life span. 5 4. Utilize evidenc e-based findings for decision -making that advances sociocultural, political, economic, legal, and ethical issues in nursing. 5. Integrate health policies from legislative and governing bodies into nursing practice. 6. Employ and lead the development of p rogram policies in collaboration with professional organizations to advocate optimal wellness for families and communities. 7. Demonstrate accountability for meeting the changing health care needs of diverse populations representing the global community, through the continuation of personal, professional, and educational development. 8. Integrate critical thinking, clinical reasoning to promote optimal wellness to clients, families and communities.

Presentation of papers at national or regional meetings of professional societies; 2. Receipt of national or regional award; 3. Holding of office in a professional organization; 4. Submission and/or acquisition of funded grants, internal or external; 5. Mentoring or contribution to the scholarly growth of peers (e.g. collaboration); 6. Development of new programs; 7. Presentation of invitational lectures; 8. Editing of professional journal submissions; and 9. Participation in panels at the regional or national meeti ng of a professional organization COMAR 10.27.03.14 Students Nursing students can participate in the governance of the DON through their representation on the various committees within the Department. Undergraduate student participation is set out in the Bowie State University Undergraduate Nursing Student Handbook as follows : Governance - It is expected that students participate in governance within the DON and University. The student participation in the governance of the University is through the BSU Student Government Association. Student participation in the governance of the DON is through the Student Nurses Association and student representation on the DON Curriculum Committee. Input from students is encouraged and welcomed regarding the courses and activities of the DON as representatives to the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee. The Student Nurses Association will hold elections annually, in the fall to elect one representative from each cohort to the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee (UCC). Student representatives are invited to attend the monthly Faculty Organization meeting and the UGCC meetings. In 2016, students attended one meeting. The DON will be working with the BSU Nursing Student Association (NSA) to increase this participation in the future. The NSA student representatives are elected by their peers (i.e., sophomor e, junior, senior) at the beginning of each academic year. The student representatives are provided an overview of their roles and responsibilities according to the DON By -Laws. The faculty NSA advisors (Ms. Wilks, traditional and RN - BSN program type, Ms. Coppedge for accelerated program type) encourage student representatives to attend scheduled Faculty Organization and Curriculum Meetings. Monthly reminder emails will go out in 2017 to student representatives to inviting them to the meetings. Student representative roles in various committees is designed is to promote their interest and awareness of current trends and policies impacting nursing, and to share their perspectives on possible solutions related to curriculum improvement and other areas of need within the DON. 29 COMAR 10.27.15 Evaluation The evaluation plan and all the evaluation tools used for analysis were developed by the Total Program Evaluation Committee (TPE), a standing committee of the nursing faculty of the whole (NFOW) for academic year 2015 - 2016. The tools that guide evaluation findings include the Course Survey (CS) administered by the University, the Faculty Evaluation of Clinical Agencies (FECAs) , and the Student Evaluation of Clinical Agencies (SECAs) administered by the Depa rtment of Nur sing (DON). The DON also administer s the Student Survey (SS), the Graduate Exit Survey (GES), the Employer Survey (ES), and the ATI 2016 scores. The completion of the End of Course Evaluation is administered by the DON. Brief descriptions o f the evaluation tools are set out below: Course Survey (CS) - The course survey is administered by the University to provide quantitative data from students for the standards and criteria as appropriate for the assessment of teaching effectiveness. The s urveys are administered in each course prior to the end of each semester. Student Survey (SS) - The student survey was developed to provide quantitative data from the students for the standards and criteria related to each clinical course. The surveys are administered during the Fall, Summer and Spring semesters. SECA and FECA - The student evaluation of clinical agencies and the faculty evaluation of clinical agencies are completed at the end of each clinical rotation in each course. Students complet e the ATI comprehensive predictor at the end of the senior year. This test measures their competency with NCLEX content as well as their ability to meet the Program SLOs and the RSGCs. Graduate and Employer Surveys - The graduate and employer surveys are used to measure graduate and employer satisfaction with the program and the program's ability to prepare students to achieve the Program SLOs and the RSGCs. End of Course Evaluations - End of course evaluations are completed by the Course Coordinator in collaboration with the course team and reported to the NFOW during the January Faculty Meeting and at the May Spring Retreat. It was determined during the Spring 2016 Retreat that the evaluations did not evaluate the course's ability to meet the Program S LOs and the data needed to be trended. The course evaluation forms were revised during the Summer 2016 semester and the 2016 -2017 SPE was updated to reflect this data. The faculty annually identifies Program SLOs to be measured. These outcomes provide a mechanism to improve the program and enhance student learning. Data are reported in the aggregate and support expected levels of achievement of standard criteria if the aggregate is at or above 2.0 for numeric data. For narrative data, the faculty assigned to each faculty committee decide whether or not each criterion is met and report these finding to the NFOW. Action plans are developed for those aggregates that score below the expected levels of achievement as seen in the SPE. The DON evaluates how effectively it meets its Program SLOs and Program Outcomes using the following tools: 30 Annual SLO ATI Report . (See the SLO ATI Report attached for the summary evaluation findings for AY2014, AY2015 and AY2016 ). This report presents the alignment of the ATI subscale scores with the DON Program SLOs . This data is aggregated and trended, and was used to inform program decision making related to the utilization of all components of the ATI Supreme Supplemental Learning resources for individual students and for the overall course assessments throughout the curriculum. These data provide indicators of weakness and strengths. Results are used to continuously improve identified areas of weakness and maintain identified areas of strengths. Annual Assessment Report - (See Annual Assessment Report attached for the summary findings for AY2014 and AY2015). The AY2016 report is scheduled for completion in 3/2017. The faculty uses multiple measures to determine whether students have achieved Program SL Os or the Role Specific Graduate Competencies (RSGC'S) including theory examinations and quizzes, written assignments, class projects, and clinical and skill competency and standardized examinations. This detailed information is summarized in the Annual A ssessment Report. The report takes the results of the course tools and aggregates the data to indicate student performance for each of the Program SLOs and Program Outcomes. The data is reported for the Traditional, Accelerated and RN -BSN program options . This data is used to inform decision -making related to the utilization of all components of the ATI Supreme Supplemental Learning resources , as well as the design of the Senior Opportunity for Remediation Success (SORS). These data provide indicators o f weakness and strength. Results are used to continuously improve identified areas of weakness and maintain identified areas of strengths. Surveys - The DON conducts Exit Surveys, Alumni Surveys, Employer Surveys, Clinical Agency Surveys, End -of-Course S urveys and Student Surveys. All of these surveys include questions that ask whether students and/or the curriculum is achieving the Program SLOs and the Program Outcomes. The results of these surveys are used to inform decision -making regarding the conte nt and organization of individual courses in the DON curriculum. These data provide indicators of weakness and strengths. Results are used to continuously improve identified areas of weakness and maintain identified areas of strengths. For the period 20 14 - 2015 the faculty was engaged in developing a MBON Action Plan to address the ACEN and MBON recommendations for program improvement planning. Evaluations were limited to internally collected data for end -of-semester nursing curriculum courses. Evalua tion findings are shared with communities of interest The DON shares the evaluation information with collaborative and regulatory agencies in the form of verbal and written reports, either during a meeting or by a verbal or electronic communication. Evalu ation findings include NCLEX pass rates, job placement data, program outcomes, and alumni survey data. Examples of examination findings that were shared during the Fall 2016 Advisory Board Meeting include the following: the DON's new vision; updated mission and philosophy; overview of the program's RSGCs and updated Program SLOs; 31 changes to the admission criteria; curriculum content reorganization areas; program outcomes data; and the results from the graduate exit survey. Additionally, board recommendati ons and any modifications to the program since the last report are addressed. The DON's Annual reports are generated and distributed to MBON , ACEN, University President, Provost, Dean of Professional Studies and A ssessment Office. This information also is shared with the University during the annual Faculty Institute meeting. Currently, the DON web site includes program information about the faculty members' education, experience, and areas of instruction . The following data is available to the colleg e community and the public via the DON web site: NCLEX -RN pass rates, DON program completion rates, and student job placement rates. The program demonstrates evidence of achievement in meeting the program outcomes. The BSU DON program can demonstrate progress toward achieving its program outcomes as evidenced by the data it has collected and analyzed. This data is in keeping with the Program detailed S ystematic Plan for Evaluation (SPE) . The faculty has worked dili gently to put a structure in place that can provide evidence of a program in the process of improving its program outcomes . The expected level of achievement serves as a benchmark by which the program outcomes are measured however, despite progress the program outcomes have not been achieved. As discussed below, several factors have contributed to this shortcoming. Importantly, since the 2014 MBON visit , the DON has worked to stabilize its leadership, develop com prehensive assessment tools, collect data, and generate aggregated report findings to inform decision - making about the program. Performance on licensure exam: The program's three -year mean for the licensure exam pass rate will be at or above the national mean for the same three -year period. The DON program pass rates for 2014 -2016 are listed in the following Table 1.0. In 2014, 2015, and 2016 the pass rates were below the national mean. The program pass rate for 2014 (52.78%), 2015 (41.10%), and 2016 (7 1%) continue to be below the national mean. As shown in the Table 1.0, the B.S. program pass rates are trending toward the benchmark set by MBON , and made a significant 30 point improvement in the rate for 2016. Table 1.0 - NCLEX Pass Rates National Mean BSU Mean National Mean BSU Mean National Mean BSU Mean 2014 2014 2015 2015 2016 2016 Expected Level of Achievement 85% 85% 85% 32 Due to the in the NCLEX -RN pass rates from 2014 -2015, a warning status letter was issued by MBON in March 2014. During that year, ACEN also placed the program on warning status. New strategies were implemented to stop the decline in the pass rate s, and finally in AY 2015 -2016 a new DON program Chair was recruited and hired to support the reorganization of the department and to seek resources needed for the implementation of the approved MBON action plan. Some of the changes which have occurred du ring the initial year of the new administrative leadership include the development of new admission criteria, updated/revised of program policies, and the reorganization of the curriculum content via the Curriculum Improvement Plan. Each of these changes is significant and we believe will contribute to a marked improvement in the DON's NCLEX pass rate in the near future. The approved 2015 MBON Action Plan included the Program's Curriculum Improvement Plan that was initiated with the senior class Spring 2 016 semester. Th e Curriculum Improvement Plan included a n immersion and integration action intervention. Prior to the immersion and integration intervention, the senior students had successfully completed the Pediatrics theory course. The DON experienced a severe limitation of Pediatric clinical experiences in off -campus direct care facilities during the Fall 2015 semester. The curriculum immersion intervention focused on reorganizing the content to better reflect the outcomes and knowledge needed by students to increase probability of their success on NCLEX -RN examination as well as the achievement of Program SLOs, RSGCs, and Program Outcomes. The immersion of curriculum content for Pediatrics, Complex Care of Adults, and Leadership courses was integrat ed. Course content was aligned to support in -lab clinical practices, faculty supervision, performance evaluation and student performance evaluation. The faculty -to-student ratios were adjusted to ensure and support quality instructional and evaluation m ethods. Special emphasis was placed on formative evaluations. Upon completion of the five -week immersion plan, educational activities, including in -lab simulation, the senior students progressed into the medical -surgical and leadership direct care clinic al course experiences. Concurrently, the senior students, were actively engaged in the ATI Capstone Review, and participated in an ATI Live Review activity. At the end of the Spring 2016 semester, the senior students' progression to graduation included t he completion of all required courses, including the ATI Comprehensive Predictor Examination. The Spring 2016 curriculum immersion and integration action intervention supported a 30 point bounce in the NCLEX -RN pass rate. The 2014 and 2015 NCLEX -RN pass rates can be attributed , at least in part, to the insufficient number of faculty in the nursing department and high turnover in the faculty and the Department Chair position during those years. In 2016, these deficiencies were corrected through the hiring of additional faculty and an experience d Department Chair. Additional resources, including standardized testing have been identified to help improve student performance on the licensure examination, including: A. Capstone Content Review course during the la st semester of the senior year B. End of course standardized testing in all core courses; and C. Adaptive learning activities The DON Chair and faculty continue to work on developing comprehensive and innovative strategies to facilitate effective student learni ng and improve NCLEX -RN pass rates. The continuous review of and changes to the B.S. program outcomes are expected to ensure that 33 the DON program NCLEX -RN pass rates continue to move in the direction of meeting the national mean for first time NCLEX test takers . Program completion: Expected levels of achievement for program completion are determined by the faculty and reflect student demographics and program options. The expected level of achievement for DON program completion was set at 80% by the facul ty to reflect the student demographics and program options. However, between 2012 and 2015 the program experienced frequent faculty turnover and five different department heads, which severely compromised the expected level of achievement for program compl etion. The program faculty have established that 75% of the students who enroll in the BS degree nursing program as freshman will complete the program within the designated 3 -year sequence. Table 2.0 Completion Rates for Students in BS Degree Program 20 13-2016 provides information for the completion rates of students who were enrolled in the BS degree progra m during the years 2013 -2016. Table 2.0 Completion Rates for Students in BS Degree Program 2013 -2016 Program Academic Year Expected Level of Achievement Program Completion Rate Traditional AY 2013 - 2014 75% Pending Accelerated 75% Pending RN-BSN 75% Pending Traditional 75% *66% ere available for AY2014 and AY 2015. **Currently, program completion rates are only calculated for the entire nursing program, not separately for each program option. An improvement in the program com pletion rate has been a major emphasis of the faculty and Administrator of the BS degree program. Through a collaboration between the faculty and the class of 2015, the Nursing Student Success Center (NSSC) was established. The NSSC utilizes volunteer peer tutors to support students as they matriculate through the BS degree program. The initial focus of the NSSC , which is a MHEC externally funded program, was the 34 supplemental support of students in their sophomo re and junior years in the BS degree nursing program. Additional measures which have been initiated to facilitate student success include the re - organization and modification of the curriculum content. Graduate program satisfaction: Qualitative and qu antitative measures address graduates six to twelve months post -graduation. Student satisfaction b ears a close relationship with student retention and success in the program. Additionally, student satisfactions results are a reliable indicator of the qua lity of the program. The BS degree nursing program measures graduate student satisfaction 6 - 12 month post -graduation by distributing a survey to the graduates using Survey Monkey or through phone calls and mail. The survey asks 10 questions to obtain b oth quantitative and qualitative data. Using the Likert scale range from 1 to 5 , with 1 meaning completely unsatisfied and 5 meaning completely satisfied. A mean score of 3 or above was considered satisfactory. In 2014 and 2015, exit surveys and post -graduate surveys were not distributed at six and twelve month intervals. In March of 2016, the DON initiated the distribution of post -graduate surveys through Survey Monkey, beginning with the Spring semester 2014 graduates. This method of distribution of surveys continued for graduated students from the Fall semester 2014 through the Fall semester 2016. Due to low response rates, the program initiated telephone calls to alumni and sent postcards announcing the mailing of surveys. Response data from the Su rvey Monkey site and telephone surveys was aggregated and trended for reporting. See Table 3.0 - Graduate Program Satisfaction Surveys below . Exit Surveys To evaluate the graduates' perception of their achievement of learning outcomes at the University, students were questioned through an Exit Survey. Students were asked to return the surveys to the BS degree nursing program so data could be collected, organized, and analyzed. The Exit Survey of graduates was utilized in 2016. Of the 88 students who graduated in May 2016, exit surveys were given to the 60 students who attended the Recognition Ceremony of Nursing Graduates rehearsal. Of the 60 surveys distributed, 29 responses were received for a 48% return rate. The survey consisted of 21 Likert -scale type questions and three qualitative questions, for a total of 24 questions. Responses revealed an 82.7% student satisfaction rate which exceeded the ELA goal of 80%. Post -Graduation Surveys The survey of graduates is sent to students within six mont hs to a year of graduation through the use of BSU's online survey tool. The alumni survey solicits information from graduates beyond one year. The students are sent an e -mail with a link to access the appropriate survey using SurveyMonkey.com. The current survey in use was revised in 2015. 35 The post -graduation survey consists of quantitative and qualitative questions which assess student perception of their overall learning and preparedness for practice as professional registered nurses in the healthcare en vironment. Copies of the surveys and results are shared with the entire nursing faculty. The recent implementation of electronic survey format and integration of ATI testing outcomes are intended to develop a program which is more centered on student lea rning outcomes. The electronic survey format is an active approach implemented by the faculty for program improvement, based on student feedback. The post -graduation survey is used to gather quantitative and qualitative data from students who have graduat ed beyond one year to measure their satisfaction with the program. Prior to 2015, this survey was mailed to alumni to be returned to the nursing department after completion. In 2016, the survey was sent to all alumni from the past four years. Survey respo nses for years 2014, 2015 and 2016 are aggregated in Table 3.0 - Post- Graduation Program Satisfaction Surveys. Table 3.0 - Post -Graduation Program Satisfaction Surveys Post -Graduation Program Satisfaction Surveys - Traditional Expected Levels of Achievement Date Survey Sent Satisfaction Rate Number of Surveys Distributed Number of Surveys Returned Response Rate 80% 6/22/2016 (sent to all alumni*) 55% 108 46 11/1/2016 (sent Traditional) 48% 78 20 26% 80% 11/1/2016 (sent to 2014 graduates - Traditional) 50% 42 4 9% Post -Graduation Program Satisfaction Surveys - Accelerated 80% 11/6/2016 (sent to 2015 graduates - Accelerated) 100% 45 5 11% 80% 11/6/2016 (sent to 2014 graduates) 0% 27 2 -Graduation Program Satisfaction 80% 6/27/2016 *66.7% 14 6 43% *RN-BSN respondents who have been promoted since graduation. 36 Employer program satisfaction: Qualitative and quantitative measures address employer satisfaction with graduate preparation for entry -level positions six to twelve months post -graduation. Employer satisfaction results allow the program to ascertain the effectiveness of the program in preparing students to fulfill their roles as professional registered nurses in the health care market. The feedback employers provide assists the program in determining the relationship between student learning and job performance. The information employers provide is used to make modifications to the program as necessary. Employer satisfaction surv eys are sent via Survey Monkey and/or they are mailed to employers 6 -12 months after the graduate has been employed. The employer satisfaction survey uses a 1 -4 (1-very satisfied, 4 -not at all satisfied) point Likert scale to evaluate leadership, collabor ation, communication and overall satisfaction with the BS degree program nursing graduate. A paper -copy of the survey was hand -delivered to employers in 2013 and 2014. The response to the paper survey was extremely low. Consequently, the faculty chose to utilize online survey technology with the intention of improving the number of returned responses and employer feedback. After implementing the online survey in 2015, the feedback did not improve. The 2015 response rate was less than 1%. The nursing faculty decided to hand deliver surveys, in addition to utilizing online surveys in 2016 with the hope of receiving an improved response rate to reflect the 80% ELA. Discussions with faculty about ways to increase the employer survey response rate have included the following: Developing and hosting a bi -annual informational forum for graduates and their employers to gather essential data related to program graduates' and their employers' satisfaction with the DON program. Increasing the frequency of survey distribution and follow -up to monthly for the first 6 months post -graduation. Conducting regional agency site visits to seek direct feedback from the nursing employers about their satisfaction with program graduate's performance. Job placement rat es: Expected levels of achievement are determined by the faculty and are addressed through quantified measures six to twelve month post -graduation. Job placement rates are a direct reflection of the student's ability to apply the Program SLOs in their n ew role as a licensed nurse. The faculty recognizes the importance of monitoring these rates to determine the overall effectiveness of the nursing degree program. The baccalaureate graduate either from the accelerated or traditional program option, is se eking to obtain an entry level position as a professional nurse. Job placement rates are gathered via the Survey Monkey surveys that are sent to nursing graduates 6 -12 months after graduation. Data from the surveys are aggregated and trended over time. Graduates of the Traditional and Accelerated 37 program options achieve employment within twelve months after completion of the nursing program. The expected levels of achievement for the Accelerated and Traditional degree program options have consistently a chieved employment within 12 months after completion of the nursing program. The expected level of achievement for both program options is 80%. Data related to job placement is obtained from the post graduate survey and individual student self -reporting. The job placement rates for 2014, 2015 and 2016 are listed in Table 4.0 below: Table 4.0 - Job Placement Rates - Traditional Job Placement Rates - Traditional Expected Levels of Achievement Date Survey Sent Job Placement Rate **Number of Surveys Distributed Number of Surveys Returned Response Rate 80% of graduates will have a job in nursing within twelve months after graduation 6/22/2016 (sent to all alumni*) 90% 108 46 43% 80% 11/1/2016 (sent Traditional) 75% 78 20 26% 80% 11/1/2016 (sent to 2014 graduates - Traditional) 75% 42 4 9% Job Placement Rates - Accelerated 80% 11/6/2016 (sent to 2015 graduates - Accelerated) 100% 45 5 11% 80% 11/6/2016 (sent to 2014 graduates) 100% 27 2 7% 80% 11/6/2016 (sent to 2015 graduates - Accelerated) 100% 45 5 11% * graduated beyond 12 months **DON only sends surveys to students who provided their e -mail address in their Exit Surveys Job Placement rates not applicable for RN -BSN program option.

High priority for hiring a full-time Clinical Labor atory faculty member. During Spring 2016 DON hired a full -time faculty member to be assigned to the Clinical Lab positi on; however , faculty was unable to meet obligation for full-time position with duties assigned. Two, Faculty resigned prior to the star ting of the Fall 2016 semester. Posting for replacement of vacant positions. Simulation Faculty Training: One (1) new faculty hired in February 2016 as a designated Clinical Instructor with dual assigned responsibilities for clinical laboratory and clini cal specialty practicums (Pediatrics). This faculty member was assigned during the Fall 2016 semester to engage and participate in the initial DON Simulation Train- the-Trainer project workshops (2 hours/week/10 weeks). In addition, one (1) new faculty member hired in February 2016 for the Maternal -Child specialty area was assigned to engage and participate in the initial DON Simulation training 53 workshop. Lastly, one (1) tenure -track faculty member for Medical -Surgical clinical specialty was assigned t o the DON training workshops. These three (3) faculty members with their completion of training will represent the DON capacity building for Simulation Laboratory clinical practice teaching, supervision and evaluation of student's clinical courses matricu lation in the program and progression to graduation with an anticipated improvement in NCLEX -RN pass rates as the expected outcome. CLINICAL Challenges for student placement in clinical learning experiences create the need for more evidence - based, innovative and contemporary best practices opportunities. Forward -thinking planning supports faculty recommendations for a proposed substantive curriculum change to start in January 2018 that will facilitate senior students having a change in their require d clinical courses. The required Medical -Surgical - Complex Care clinical course currently taken during the final senior semester has had a negative impact on students' learning and program outcomes. Completing the medical -surgical content during the final senior semester also has not supported the expected levels of achievement for students or their ability to demonstrate role -specific competency skills for application Substan tive curriculum changes are needed to address this issue. Plans for this change are underway, including the expanded use of simulation in lieu of clinical time (includes method and number of hours). New facilities for nursing clinical labs, including clin ical simulation labs, will be fully equipped and open in Fall 2017 on campus. With the addition of new equipment, faculty will be involved in training on the use of simulation technology as well as its methodology. 54 and synthesis in their progression toward graduation. To accomplish this, it is proposed that the timing of NURS 411: Care of Complex patients and NURS 409: Nursing Practice Community be changed from the Spring to Fall semesters respectively, with a request for a substantive curriculum change and proposal submission during Fall 2017. Given the limited number of clinical sites, faculty to student ratios have limited the ability of faculty to provide clinical instruction and supervision of students, and to evaluate students' performance. Reduce the clinical faculty to student ratio from 1:8 to 1:6, and depending on the age ncy requirements to 1:4. Due to patient acuity and the learning needs of the students, a reduction in the 2016 clinical size was piloted during the Spring 2016 semester with Junior and Senior students. Faculty reported that Senior clinical groups that hav e a smaller cohort allowed them to better assess the individual student's learning needs. Based on this assessment, this reduction in the faculty student ratio is expected to improve the students' clinical skills, thus translating to the improved NCLEX -RN pass rate. Started January 2016 Will continue and will be re - evaluated at the end of the 2016 -2017 academic year Standardization of clinical tools 100% of nursing faculty and students will utilize e -clinical manual. Review with the faculty members the process for the completion of the Clinical Evaluation Tools. May Retreat Revise the Clinical Evaluation Tool to reflect more emphasis on evidence -based clinical evaluation August 2015 55 STUDENT LEARNING RESOURCES The delay in the assessment of pre-nursing students' basic knowledge of math, reading comprehension, English composition and the sciences, until after their formal admission to the nursing program hindered faculty planning based on the objective need for remediation intervention. The D ON utilizes standardized tests as learning assessment resources within the department. Standardized examinations are administered to assist students in identifying their areas of weakness and provide practice opportunities for testing in a secure environm ent. Because different students have different learning needs and areas of deficiency, one standardized testing resource is not enough to support the entire student body. Providing the students with multiple exposures to standardized tests of expected nur sing knowledge is necessary. The ample resources available through ATI, with the help of the faculty, should enable the students to select several learning resources from the Supreme Package to support their individual learning styles. Optimally, this early identification of gaps in the student's knowledge will increase the opportunities for successful remediation and improve the DON program's pass rate on the NCLEX - RN.

The ATI -TEAS examination, which traditionally is used for assessment and predictive purposes of pre - Nursing majors, is not used as an admission criteria in the DON. The ATI-TEAS examination is administered during the first week of classes to all newly enrolled nursing students. The results are used by faculty to inform their instruction and advisement of each student. Exam was started in May 2016 and will continue to be used as a proctored Course Coordinator Program Coordinator ATI Assessment Coordinator ATI examination results, analysis and outcomes documented to facilitate referral and remediation as required. 56 The ATI learning management system is available to all enrolled nursing students, and they have received the following ATI products (e.g., RN case studies, practice tests, video skills - student on -line version, adaptive learning quizzes, specialty area tutori als and exams), to assist with their studies and in preparation for the NCLEX -RN examination. ATI on -line resources are used in the curriculum to offer a variety of learning opportunities to accommodate all students' learning styles. ATI standardized exa ms also will be used in the assessment of student learning outcomes. Started Spring 2016 and will be ongoing. In the Department's attempt to improve the NCLEX -RN pass rate of current students, the Department will implement the following: Institute the ATI end -of-course proctored standardized examination in all core courses (Fundamentals, Medical - Surgical, Mental Health, Maternal/Child, Care of Children, Community, Leadership, Pharmacology, and Nutrition), to assess student knowledge of essential content , necessary for passing NCLEX on the first attempt.

Dr. Rena Boss -Victoria , Associate Professor and Chair for the BSUDON completed h er bachelor's degree in nursing science at the University of St. Thomas \u2014Texas; her master's in nursing from Texas Woman's University; and her doctorate (PhD) from the University of Texas -School in Public Health in Houston, Texas. She is experientially qualified and meets governing organization and state requirements to assume the role of nursing program administrator. Dr. Boss -Victoria exceeds the requirements of Bowie State University and the Maryland Board of Nursing as she possesses 23 years of nursing education experience and over 15 years of administrative experience . She maintains a current registered nurse license. (B.1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12): Responsibilities . The Bowie State University Department of Nursing Follow -Up Report for the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, January 23, 2017 indicated that D r. Boss -Victoria \"has the authority and responsibility for the development and administration of the Nursing Program consistent with all academic department chairs at Bowie State University\" (p.39). S he is \"responsible for recruiting faculty, assisting in faculty development and evaluation, developing and reviewing department programs, advising and counseling students, preparing and managing the department budget, maintaining student records, developing class schedules, reviewing course evaluation, supervis ing research, overseeing the new building layout for the nursing program, scholarly activities, and teaching within the unit\" (p. 39). She is identified as the \"official representative of the DON at the administrative level and reports directly to the Dean of the College of Professional Studies\" (p. 39). This information was corroborated through interviews with the Interim Dean of the College of Professional Studies, Dr. Elliott Parris; BSU Provost, Dr. Weldon Jackson; and BSU Burnim ( retires June 30, 2017) . Faculty, in collaboration with and under the direction of Dr. Boss -Victoria , participate in recommendations for: faculty appointments; nursing educational programs; preparation and administration of the nursing program budget. The Bowie State University Department of Nursing Follow -Up Report for the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, January 23, 2017; Faculty Minutes\u20142013-2016 ; and faculty interviews conducted during the March 2017 site visit provided supporting documentation . Faculty play a pivotal role in the formulation and implementation of the all policies governing the nursing program, including those relative to: student admission and progression; advanced standing; transfer and articu lation; withdrawal; reinstatement; evaluation; and graduation requirements. Faculty, in collaboration with and under the direction of Dr. Boss -Victoria , participate in determining the student/teacher ratio required to meet the objectives of each course a nd to define the methods of instruction employed. The faculty are involved in determining the number and qualifications of faculty required to meet programmatic requirements. BSUDON has a faculty orientation, mentoring and development program, as noted in the Bowie State University Department of Nursing Follow -Up Report for the Accreditation Commission for Education in 6 Nursing, January 23, 2017 and the BSUDON Faculty Handbook . The BSUDON program is implemented in accordance with the Maryland Board of Nursing regulatory requirements. .08 FACULTY AND CLINICAL INSTRUCTORS BSU DON meets this regulatory requirement as evidenced by the following: A. (1) Qualifications of Nurse Faculty: Bowie State Univer sity has fifteen full -time nursing faculty, not including the Director of Nursing. Each of the full -time faculty records were reviewed, and 100% of the faculty met the qualifications set forth in COMAR 10.27.03.08A . A. (2) & (3); B: The Waiver of Gradu ate Degree in Nursing Requirement for Nursing Faculty is not applicable to the Bowie State University Department of Nursing. C. (1 & 2) Qualifications of Clinical Nurse Faculty: This program also has eighteen adjunct faculty that serve as the clinical fac ulty for BSU DON. Each of the part -time faculty records were reviewed, and 100% of the faculty met the qualifications set forth in COMAR 10.27.03 .08C(1)(a) -(d). In addition to meeting the qualifications set forth in COMAR, BSU DON requires that part -time faculty teaching courses for credit must meet the same requirements for experiential, scholarly, and professional preparation as their full -time counterparts. Most clinical experiences are overseen by full -time and/or part -time c linical faculty. In some instances, there is a need to utilize preceptors. Preceptors are academically and experientially qualified, mentored, and monitored. All preceptors utilized are required to have at least a MSN, an unencumbered multistate RN lice nse and a minimum of two years of clinical experience in the specialty area . D. Responsibilities: D. (1): The primary role of the faculty of BSUDON is teaching. Faculty are responsible for multiple content areas with a focus in medical and surgical nu rsing of adults, pediatrics, mental health nursing, community health nursing and maternal/child nursing. Faculty may be assigned to Special Projects and/or Program Innovation Initiatives as required to address the needs of the DON. Clinical hours are a r equirement for all faculty members. It is the responsibility of the faculty member to establish mutual responsibilities between the agency and the educational institution. Faculty are also required to participate in planning, implementing, evaluatin g, and revising the nursing program curriculum . Faculty meeting minutes validate the involvement of the entire nursing faculty. D. (2): The faculty of the BSU DON are dedicated to the development and implementation standards for admission, progression and gr aduation of students. The Admission, Progression and Graduation Committee (APG) meets regularly to discuss the development and implementation of standards for admission, progression and graduation of students. Currently there is one undergraduate academi c advisor for the DON. The DON needs to fill three academic advisor positions. In order to meet the needs of the growing number of enrolling nursing students, the DON will need to hire an Undergraduate Nursing Academic Coordinator in 7 addition to the othe r advisor positions. This individual is responsible for the management of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), Registered Nurse (RN) to BSN and Accelerated BS 2nd Degree programs. This position is responsible for advisement, curriculum and progression issues, scheduling, and course availability, by way of example . The individual would monitor and assist Academic Advisors in determining admission eligibility. The se four unfilled positions would alleviate some of the burden for the nursing faculty. The faculty are now required to manage their own academic advising of approximately 25 -35 students. Ideally, the BSUDON would like for the academic advising to be hand led by non -nurse faculty. This would allow the nurse faculty to focus on teaching and other required academic and professional commitments. BSUDON Faculty have a plan in place for the systematic review and evaluation of the student learning outcome s (SLOs) and role specific graduate competencies. Formative and summative evaluation processes are well documented in the DON. SLOs are measured through exams, adapted learning assignments, poster presentation rubrics, scholarly presentation rubrics, and weekly evaluation of performance in the directed clinical practice for each course. Faculty also meet monthly (started Fall 2016) to discuss students who are at-risk academically. Risk assessments are conducted to assess the SLOs for all students. Students who are identified as at- risk are referred for remediation. The review of faculty records (full -time and part -time faculty) show evidence of maintaining current clinical skills. Faculty maintain appropriate nursing licensure, certifications and evidence of advanced degree completion. This information is incorporated in their confidentially -maintained faculty files. The DON faculty have an established plan which makes all course/learning materials accessible to students. A variety of instructio nal methods are utilized to deliver course content outside of traditional lecture. Blackboard\u00ae is an electronic based learning management system and the primary source for students to access course materials. Faculty record lectures for students and upload them to Blackboard\u00ae by using a system called Collaborate . Students are able to download the application onto their smart devices and utilize its functions in the classroom. DON faculty also use group projects, discussion boards, case studies, role pla y, and \"flipping the classroom\" as additional instructional delivery methods. The BSUDON has undergone a great deal of faculty turnover since the last site visit : September 30\u2014October 2, 2014 . Quite a number of faculty have left, but several have been hired. Several recruitment strategies have been implemented since Fall 2014 to increase the number of faculty and the utilization of faculty, to ensure that student learning and program outcomes are being met. Since Fall 2014, recruitment and retention o f faculty has stabilized. Faculty actively participate in the recruitment, selec tion and promotion of faculty. The nursing faculty have input in the interview process. Typically , there are three faculty members on a panel, including the Course Coordinator for th e identified specialty. They collectively review prospective candidates' CVs and offer input regarding recruitment efforts. Bowie State University and the Department of Nursing have developed a comprehensive system for evaluating faculty performa nce. Each faculty receives a peer evaluation and an evaluation from the Chair. Faculty are required to complete an annual Faculty Self -Evaluation and 8 Professional Development Plan that outlines their future goals and accomplishments. The Chair reviews t he Professional Development Plan. Faculty are evaluated primarily on teaching effective ness, scholarship and service. The Office of Planning, Analysis, and Accountability manages t he faculty evaluation process. An annual review for tenure and promotion ar e also components of the evaluation process . Students have the opportunity to evalu ate the faculty's performance and course learning experiences. These are completed at the end of every course. D. (3): A clinical visit was conducted at Spring Grove Hospital Center. Mrs. Tenni John - Idiagbonya, MSN, FNP /Adjunct Faculty (BSU), Noyes manager (Spring Hospital Center) and Iguehi Edeoghon, LPN Staff Nurse (Noyes Unit) were the hospital representatives. BSUDON uses four units for the clinical experiences (two long -term care units, one admission/research unit, and one admission unit). Dr. Doris Scott, PhD, MSN, RN, Course Coordinator, provided insight into the student clinical experience on the Noyes Unit. There were six students in the clin ical setting on the day of the visit. The students are Traditional students in their junior year. The Noyes unit is a locked unit, so safety is emphasized heavily with the students. Dr. Scott determines th e patient assignments, based upon goals and obje ctive that incorporate current classroom learning with patient care experiences. Students are not allowed to administer medication during this clinical experience. The students have other assignments to expose them to mental health in the community setting. They are required to attend A lcoholics' Anonymous meeting s and to teach patients an assigned activity. The Director of Education for Spring Grove created a simulation for the students to experience auditory hallucinations. Six students were intervie wed. The date of the visit was the student's first day of clinical and they enjoyed it thus far. They stated that in preparation for this clinical experience (and others) they had to successfully pass the dosage exam and skills checklist. They also felt that they were prepared for this clinical experience. The students described the instructors as being open, knowledgeable and available. In the short time, the students noticed that the staff on the unit were supportive and helpful. The students were a ble to able to articulate the policies governing the formative and summative evaluation processes with clinical faculty. .09 FACULTY POLICIES BSU DON meets this regulatory requirement as evidenced by the following: A. &B.: The Bowie State University Faculty Handbook and Department of Nursing Faculty Handbook incorporates faculty personnel policies for full -time and part -time faculty. They include information regarding faculty governance, teaching load and evaluation. Nursing f aculty follow established BSU and DON personnel policies. The DON has recognized personnel policies governing teaching load and evaluation specific to the nursing profession and in accordance with accreditation standards. The policies are approved by the Bowie State University in recognition of the inherent requirements for nursing education. 9 .10 FACULTY ORGANIZATION BSU DON meets this regulatory requirement as evidenced by the following: A-E.: The BSU nursing program is organized by sequential semesters. Full -time faculty actively participate in shared governance through faculty meetings, DON committee meetings and University -wide committee meetings. The departmental committees ensure that faculty can participate, offer opinions and are able t o have involvement in the decision making process. The DON consists of six standing committees: Undergraduate Curriculum Committee; Admission, Progression, and Graduation Committee; Total Program Evaluation; Appointment, Rank and Tenure Committee; Resourc es and Technology Committee; and Faculty Evaluation Committee. Students are encouraged to attend monthly faculty/committee meetings. Minutes for the past three school years were reviewed, which documented actions and decisions made during faculty and com mittee meetings. .11 FACULTY DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION BSUDON meets this regulatory requirement as evidenced by the following: A-C.: Faculty orientation is mandatory for all new faculty. BSUDON requires new faculty to complete a department orientation in addition to an orientation given by the Human Resources Department. Orientation takes place over a two day period where new faculty have the opportunity to meet the Department Chairs and the Provost. The new faculty have the opportunity to attend seminars and engage in discussions related to teaching. New faculty are also invited to the two -day Faculty Institute for returning faculty . New faculty are assigned to a mentor in the specifically -designated specialty course for the academic year. The senior faculty are expected to orient and guide new faculty in the departmental policies and procedures. The mentor also serves as a resour ce for the new faculty throughout the academic year. The University sponsors a biennial Faculty Institute to promote faculty development. During this event, best practices in effective teaching, ATI development and trainings are offered. There are no additional monies allotted for faculty development at this time . Faculty can submit requests for monetary support for scholarly endeavors and conference attendance. Faculty evaluation is described in the Bowie State University and BSU Nursing Program Fac ulty Handbooks, respectively, and are performed by the Department Chair. Peer, student, and agency -based evaluations were reviewed for all full -time faculty and a representative sample of part-time faculty during the site visit. Documents supported the p olicy for the faculty evaluation process. .12 RESOURCES, FACILITIES AND SERVICES : BSUDON meets this regulatory requirement as evidenced by the following: A. Physical Facilities: A tour of the physical facilities was conducted at the Bowie State University campus. The physical facilities are adequate to meet the needs of the BSUDON program. Adequate space is available for privacy of faculty -student conferences (on campus and 10 in the clinical settings). Classrooms, simulation and skills laboratories and conference rooms are available for student learning. New construction for the College of Professional Studies is complete. The BSUDON has a new state -of-the-art center housed within t he new building and will assume occupancy in Summer 2017. B. & C. Learning and Educational Support Resources: Learning resources, tutorial centers (including the Nursing Student Success Center [NSSC] , funded by MHEC in Fall 2015), a fully operational library with technology supports, and faculty development support are available for students and faculty, respectively. There is an orientation extended to nursing students and faculty to insure familiarity with the use of on -campus and online resources. Students and faculty can access services online and have remote access assistance as needed. These resources are current, comprehensive and commiserate with other academic programs on campus. D. Clinical Facilities: Spring Grove Hospital Center is a 425 -bed complex that provides a variety of inpatient psychiatric servi ces to adults and adolescents. The hospital also has a comprehensive residential ps ychiatric services for adults. The center is owned and oper ated by the State of Ma ryland. It is under the governance of the Mental Hygiene Administration of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The facility is fully accredited by the Joint Commission and CMS certified. This agency was reviewed by a MBON representative during the March 2017 site visit and is included in this report, by way of example, as indicative of the types of agencies with which the BSUDON has established agreements for clinical educational practice. BSUDON also utilizes, by way of example, the following agen cies for undergraduate learning experiences: Veterans' Hospital for Sick Children/Home Care; MedStar \u2014Southern Maryland Hospital; and the Baltimore Washington Medical Center. A session was conducted with representatives of the following agencies used for student clinical experiences: Heart to Hand (Community Health Experiences); Anne Arundel Medical Center (Ms. Wilkes); BSU Health and Wellness Center ; Hospital for Sick Children/Home Care. These agency representatives were highl y supportive of the BSUDON students and faculty. Classroom Facilities: Two classroom observations were conducted during the March site visit: Nursing 203/Foundations (Faculty: Sharon Wilkes and Twanna Whitehead; Assessment \u2014Lab (Faculty Ms. Tabito Rigsby Robin; 7 students). Both classes provided an overview of teaching -learning modalities employed to enhance stud ent learning. The classroom and lab facilities were adequate for the respective course endeavors. E. Written Agreements: All agency written agreements were reviewed and meet this COMAR standard. 11 .13 CURRICULUM : BSUDON meets this regulatory requirement as evidenced by the following: A\u2014D.: The BSUDON nursing faculty maintain oversight for the nursing curriculum. The faculty are immersed in curriculum re -design, as identified in the follow -up study, January 2017, and summarized in this standard. The curriculum is logically defined and has a reasonable sequential flow with a clearly articulated nursing philosophy, student and program outcomes . The supporting documents complement the information described in the follow -up study. The level of complexity in nursing practice is articulated in each course syllabus and is sequentially - defined in accordance with student advancement in the nursing program. Student clinical experiences are designed to enhance didactic learning and are offered concurrently within the sequentially -defined courses of study. Evaluation methods and tools were reviewed and appear to support student learning and growth. Ratios of classroom to clinical hours for each clinical nursing course were clearly articulated for the BSUDON undergr aduate program. The Nursing Philosophy addresses the faculty's beliefs about \"professional nursing education and professional nursing practice, the nature of the client, health, and the environment \" (BSUDON Follow -Up Study, January 2017, p. 92) . The Philo sophy of Nursing Education incorporates \"the development of caring, therapeutic communication, cultural competence, social awareness and collaborative skills that facilitate academic and personal development\" (p. 92). The curriculum plan, the curriculum ob jectives, student and program outcomes appear appropriate to meet the expectations of entry level baccalaureate degree graduates into professional nursing practice. Students meet requirements for arts and humanities, social and behavioral sciences, biol ogical and physical sciences as a part of their pre -requisite requirements. Pre-requisite requirements (re - sequencing) are under review by faculty, as noted below. In Spring 2015, the Maryland Board of Nursing approved the Curriculum Improvement Plan proposed by the BSUDON. In Fall 2015, the BSUDON developed and completed the following , as documented in the Bowie State University Department of Nursing Follow -Up Report for the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (p. 59 \u201460): A Curriculum Mapping Process Plan; A Syllabus Review Process Plan; Established an Ad Hoc Curriculum Core for Focused Content Review; Reviewed clinical evaluation tools and processes; Conducted faculty self -assessment and evaluation processes; Hired a new chairperson for the BSUDON ; and Recruited and interviewed aggressively for qualified faculty. In Spring 2016, the BSUDON established the following essential components to support curriculum requirements for the nursing program, as documented in the Bowie State University Department of Nursing Follow -Up Report for the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (p. 59 \u201460): Initiated Curriculum Mapping Process; Defined SLO (cour se and program) areas that needed enhancement; 12 Implemented Curriculum Innovative Clinical Integration Plan; Updated clinical evaluation tools and processes to include weekly (formative) and end of the course summaries (summative); Planned for and conducted a Faculty Retreat focused on curriculum improvement; Reaffirmed at the retreat, the program vision, mission, philosophy, goals and Program SLOs ; and Initiated the development plans for the Nursing Student Success Center (NSSC) as funded by MHEC in Fall 20 15 for peer -to-peer tutoring. In Summer 2016, the BSUDON engaged an ACEN Task Force , as documented in the Bowie State University Department of Nursing Follow -Up Report for the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (p. 59 \u201460), to: Perform gap analyses, syllabi/SLO reviews, and to provide a summary to finalize the curriculum mapping findings ; Review program evaluation tools (surveys to students, faculty, affiliations, and clinical agencies); Gather data using various techniques, including a revised Survey Monkey survey for more efficient and effective data collecti on. In Fall 2016, the BSUDON opened the Nursing Student Success Center (NSSC) for referrals, tutoring and supplemental teaching. In Spring 2017, the BSUDON submitted and are curr ently seeking final approval for implementation of re -sequencing prerequisites for the nursing program (by May 2017). In Summer 2017, the BSUDON will submit for approval the proposal for course content changes for courses in Junior 2nd Semester and Senior 1st Semester. In Fall 2018, the BSUDON will submit for approval the proposal for course content changes for co urses in Senior 2nd semester. The faculty will complete full implementation of the new curriculum once these approvals are co mpleted. The supporting documentation noted in courses syllabi, curriculum meeting/faculty meeting minutes are clearly articulated and reflect full faculty inclusion in these processes. These changes are demonstrative of faculty commitment to the curricu lum, students and the nursing program. E. & F.: The BSUDON curriculum meets the elements noted in these COMAR requirements, as evidenced in course syllabi documents and agency contracts reviewed during the site visit. Faculty interviews also corroborated these findings. G.: The BSUDON program meets the elements for this COMAR requirement. H.\u2014L: The BSUDON program meets the elements noted in these COMAR requirements, as evidenced in documents reviewed during the site visit and through interview with fa culty. M. Clinical Preceptorships: All preceptorship written agreements were reviewed and meet this COMAR standard. Preceptors are primarily utilized in NURS 412: Transition into Professional Nursing Practice -Clinical. 13 The BSUDON is required to provide a report on the status of the revised BSUDON curriculum by June 30, 2018 (FY 2018) to the MBON. .14 STUDENTS BSUDON meets this regulatory requirement as evidenced by the following: A.-C.: The MBON and ACEN visitors met with nine (9) nursing students (sophomores, juniors, and graduating seniors) during the site visit. There was cross -representation of student attendees enrolled in the accelerated program (3 students), the traditional undergraduate program (5 students) and one (1) sophomore student sch eduled to begin program mat riculation. Students believed the BSUDON program was student -focused and one which encouraged them to be successful. Faculty were identified as accessible to assist them in learning endeavors. They discussed the following conce pts: how they were oriented to the nursing program ; how they interpreted evidence -based practice ; how they utilized ATI resources; how students participated in faculty committee endeavors, with feedback from their respective class representatives; and their usage of simulation. They believed they had input in the nursing program. Access to campus -wide services was not an issue . Two students indicated they used tutorial support services and found them helpful to meeting their learning needs. They spoke positively of the support offered through the Admissions, Registration, and Financial Aid offices . The policies governing students' rights and responsibilities and student grievances were published in the Bowie State University College Catalog, the Nursing Student Handbook, and were available online through the BlackBoard\u00ae website. Students confirmed th eir awareness of these policies and locations for review. A representative sample of student records was reviewed during the site visit. These student records were complete and maintained in the BSUDON Administrative Office under a double - locked security system. When students leave the program through graduation or attrition, their final records are maintained in a double -locked secured filing system within the BSUDON program. Students use Pre -Check for criminal background checks. The college is not pri vy to the information and the students' reports are forwarded directly to the clinical facility. If there is a problem with the criminal background check, the student is not able to continue with the program since there are limited clinical facility oppor tunities. Since the college began requiring criminal history record checks, only one student has been rejected by the clinical facility. .15 EVALUATION: The BSUDON program does not meet this regulatory requirement. The BSUDON has a clearly defined systematic plan for evaluation of the program. It includes definitions for each program component, levels of responsibility, source documentation, frequency of assessment, and assessment methods. However, the preliminary re sults, data collection and analyses were not sufficient to address program trends and evaluation at this time. 14 It is too early to determine the impact and trends in data collection/findings and quality improvement for the nursing program. A. & B.: The review of the BSUDON Systematic Plan for Evaluation 2014 \u20142016, BSUDON Faculty Minutes, BSUDON Curriculum Minutes, and a faculty interview session were incorporated to assess the development and early implementation of the program evaluation processes . C.: The MBON site visit team was unable to identify the trends and outcomes of the newly implemented evaluation plan for the BSUDON program, at the time of the visit. No determination could be made regarding the effectiveness of the evaluation process during the time of the site visit. D. (1) & (2): There were few recommendations for programmatic revisions or action plans regarding proposed improvements as the systematic plan began in July 201 4. There was insufficient time for B SUDON to measure outco mes and address impact of the curriculum enhancement (curriculum re -design), as both are in process of development and implementation. The BSUDON is required to provide a report on the status of the implemented BSUDON Systematic Plan for Evaluation 2014 \u20142016 by June 30, 2018 to the MBON. The MBON is to be notified of the determinations made by the ACEN accrediting body and if a follow -up visit is planned. .16 LICENSURE EXAMI NATION PERFORMANCE NCLEX -RN\u00ae Pass Rates 56.34% 80.03% 15 RECOMMENDATIONS : 1.

Review the FY 2018 report and determine whether a survey visit is needed (COMAR 10.27.03.15F (1) -(2)). PROGRAM STRENGTHS : 1. Nursing Student Success Center (NSSC), funded by MHEC in Fall 2015, supports educational enrichment and remediation needs of the nursing students. The BSU DON Remediation process is extensive and fully supports the success of the nursing students. 2. Faculty fully promote student participation in the governance of BSU DON . Student's opinions are heavily considered in decisions made in regard to the nursing program. 3. The faculty are passionate and dedicated to the success of their students . The faculty foster team unity , through inclusion of newer faculty and the promotion of educational continuity. 4. The Chair and faculty are working diligently upon curriculum enhancement (re -design) to improve student learning and program outcomes. 5. New construction for the College of Professional Studies is complete. The BSUDON has a new state -of-the-art center housed within the new building and will assume occupancy in Summer 2017.

(\"Goldenstar\"). During the site visit, Board staff noted that Goldenstar failed to maintain adequate and complete records documenting student performance and progress , attendance , and academic achievement (including transcripts and completed skills checklists ). These deficiencies necessarily result in violation s of the following Board regulations: Code of Maryland Regulations ( COMAR ) 10.39.02.08 A. Each training program shall have an objective final examination that measures achievement of the performance indicators. B. To successfully complete the program, each tr ainee shall: 1. Complete the approved training program; 2. Demonstrate the ability to perform nursing functions with clients of any age and with carious levels of physical, sensory, cognitive, and emotional ability; 3. Pass a comprehensive written final examination ; and 4. Demonstrate competence in meeting the objectives and performance indicators contained in the training requirements. C. Each trainee shall be evaluated on their ability to meet the program objectives in the classroom, laboratory, and clinical setting. D. Each program shall submit to the Board, on a quarterly basis, statistics on enrollments, program completions, and attrition rates. Board staff notified the Maryland Higher Education Commission (\"MHEC\") about its findings, as MHEC approval is one of the mi nimum qualifications a nursing assistant training program must achieve to be approved by the Board. O n July 21, 2016, MHEC performed its own site visit and observed the same and similar deficiencies in Goldenstar's recordkeeping (see attached corresponden ce from MHEC , dated July 27, 2016). In its July 27, 2016 correspondence, MHEC permitted Goldenstar 120 da ys to cure the deficiencies noted du ring its July 21, 2016 site visit. On August 24, 2016, Board st aff presented the results of its July 12, 2016 sit e visit, along with those of MHEC, during the Board's open session meeting . The matter was presented as an FYI update to the Board, and t he Bo ard instructed staff to continue to monitor Goldenstar's performance. On September 26, 2016, Board staff sent a letter to Goldenstar explaining the results of the July 12, 2016 site visit and informing Goldenstar that Boa rd staff planned to conduct a follow -up site visit, within 120 days of MHEC's July 27, 2016 notice, to assess Goldenstar's compliance with the Bo ard's regulations ( see attached correspondence from Board staff, dated September 26, 2016). Due to various scheduling conflicts involving Goldenstar's owner, the program had a total of 182 days to cure the deficiencies noted during the Board's July 12, 2016 site visit. On March 29, 2017, Board staff conducted a follow -up site visit, during which Goldenstar was unable to produce any records of student attendance or academic progress and achievement , including tra nscripts and completed skills checklists , for the period between July 12, 2016 and March 29, 2017. Therefore, Goldenstar remains in violation of the Board's regulations. Also on March 29, 2017, MHEC performed its own follow -up site visit and observed similar deficiencies in Goldenstar's student re cords . On April 3, 2017, MHEC issued a formal \"Notice of Deficiencies ,\" in which it charged Goldenstar with various violations of MHEC's regulations, levied a $35,000 fine against Goldenstar, prohibited Goldenstar fr om enrolling new students in its nursing assistant training program, and required Goldenst ar to cure all violations within thirty (30) days of the N otice of Deficiencies ( see attached Notice of Deficiencies, dated April 3, 2017) . Furthermore, MHEC advised Goldenstar that if it fails to pay the fine and cure the violat ions in the time allotted , MHEC intends to revoke approval of Goldenstar's nursing assistant training program. On or about April 14, 2017, Goldenstar invoked its right to request a hearing on the violations alleged in MHEC's Notic e of Deficiencies. Considering the formal actions taken by MHEC against Goldenstar, including an order to cease and desist immediately fr om enrolling new students in its nursing assistant training program, Board staff recommends continue d monitor ing at th is time . Should Goldenstar cure the violations noted in MHEC's Notice of Deficiencies, then there will be no further action required by the Board. However, should Goldenstar fail to cure the violations , and should MHEC ultimately withdraw its approval of Goldenstar's nursing assistant training program, then Board staff will bring this case back to the Board for a decision on whether to withdraw the Board's approval of Goldenstar's nursing assistant training program .

They would like to remove the Learning Portfolio and replace it with the Moodle discus sion questions; replace the \"Community Competent Care\"; add Palliative Care content; and update the textbook. The Learning Portfolio was a tool implemented by the previous program manager and no longer supports the educa tional needs of the students. Moodle is an online course management program that allows instructors to interact with students and one another. The Moodle discussion questions allow for student engagement with the instructor. The instructor can assess th e student's engagement as well as their comprehension of course content. Community Nursing content was also implemented by the previous program manager. The approved textbook offers little information regarding Community Nursing. Cultural competence is extremely important for caregivers. Chapter two of the student text will directly address this need, in addition to over sixty other references throughout the textbook. The addition of Palliative Care would not only strengthen the students holistically ; but, would also increase student interest in pursuing a potential career in this specialty. Chapter ten of the approved textbook addresses the topic of Palliative Care. In the near future, Hagerstown would like to add a designated hospice facility for an additional clinical experience. Currently, this course requires the use of \"Medical Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems\" 9 th edition, Lewis (Elsevier) as their textbook. The tenth edition was just published and Hagersto wn would like to update the text. 8. a. M E M O R A N D U M FROM: Shirley A.

Tyminski, Administrator Re: Electrology Institution Recognition Application At its April 5, 2017 meeting, the Electrology Practice Committee was made aware that its Electrology Institution Recognition Application form had not been pre-approved by the Board of Nursing. This application form is important to the process of approving electro logy schools. There is currently no electrology school in Maryland. The Committee is sending this form to an electrology school in Virginia (Skin Care Institute) for the purpose ofbetter evaluating this school's current program . The Committee has received an application from a person who recently completed the Electrology program at Skin Care Institute. The application included a letter from the EPC to the director of the school dated April , 2004 notifying the school that the EPC had approved its program. The Skin Care Institute's submission for approval did not include the Electrology Institution Recognition Application , and the curriculum submitted in 2004 does not indicate the current requirement of 600 hours of instruction. The electrologist application has been placed on hold pending receipt of information that complies with COMAR 10.53 .06.01-08 Electrology Programs. The EPC requests approval of the attached Electrology Institution Recognition Application.

Tyminski, Administrator Sharon Allen, Administrative Specialist The members of the Direct-Entry Midwifery Advisory Committee are: A1exaR. Richardson, LDEM, Chair December, 2018 Jan Kriebs, CNM , MSN, FACNM Term Expires December 2018 Harold Fox , MD (Representing MHA) Term Expires December 2017 Elizabeth Reiner, LDEM Term Expires December 2017 Kai CPM Term Expires December2017 Julia Perkins, RN , CRM Term Expired December 2016* Jessica Watkins, Consumer Member Term Expires January 31, 2021 *Julia Perkins' term expired December 31, 2016. This expiration date was inadvertently overlooked by staff and the Committee . In an e-mail received April 10, 2017, Ms. Perkins indicated she would like to remain as a Committee member for another term. Meetings The Committee meets monthly. In the first quarter of2017 the Committee held meetings in January, February and March. Status of Work Accomplished The Committee received 8 applications for licensure in January 2017. Seven applicants were presented to the BON for approval as licensed Direct-Entry Midwives. One application is pending. It was referred for investigation as that application was accompanied by an Order from the Commonwealth of Virginia. The investigation is expected to be completed in April for presentation to the Direct-Entry Midwifery Committee at its May 12 meeting. The DEMs portion of the BON website has been updated with the application and forms approved by the BON that are required of LDEMs in practice. Quarterly Report to Board of Nursing Direct-Entry Midwifery Advisory Conunittee April 26, 2017 -2\u00ad The OEMs Conunittee has commenced reviewing its statute and is making suggested changes for the 2018 session. Problems/Concerns License Expiration Date: In February, shortly after the initial DEMs were licensed, staff noticed the expiration dates of the licenses were inaccurate in the licensure data base (MLO). The regulations for OEMs clearly state that all licenses expire on October 28 of odd-numbered years, making the expiration date for recently licensed OEMs October 28,2017. Sarah Pendley, AAG, Board Counsel, Shirley Devaris, Director of Legislation , Richard Proctor, Interim Director, and Keva Jackson-McCoy, Deputy Director were consulted . It was agreed by all that the expiration dates of the 7 new licensees would be October 28,2017. Mrs. Tyminski, Administrator for the DEMs Committee, took the matter to the DEMs Conunittee's March 10 meeting. Prior to the meeting, Mrs . Tyminski had made the Committee Chair aware ofthe situation . Mrs. Tyminski explained to the Committee that aninitial application fee does not guarantee that the initial license will be good for two years . The regulations state that the renewed license will expire two years after the renewal and all licenses must be renewed by October 28. Newly licensed members of the Committee were extremely unhappy. Persons in the DEMs conununity who have not yet sought licensure had learned ofthe situation and have been very vocal in their displeasure . Many are refusing to seek licensure until after October 28,2017 even though practice in Maryland is not appropriate without licensure. On April 4 all 7 of the LDEMs were e-mailed a corrected new licensee letter that indicated the corrected date of license expiration as October 28, 2017. Recording of Births Outside an Institution: Last fall, Vital Statistics the process for issuing birth certificates for births taking place outside an institution. Rather than filing directly with Vital Statistics, such birth certificates were to be issued by local health officers. Not all health officers were interpreting the process in the same manner. This caused stress amongst certified nurse midwives who perform home deliveries and was causing undue hardship on new parents. The statute for the direct-entry midwives also called for their inunediate filing of birth information for birth certificates. Vital Statistics had failed to include LDEMs as persons authorized to file birth information . Attempts were made to bring all parties together for discussion. Interim Executive Director Richard Proctor met informally with Geneva Sparks, Registrar. Board Counsel Sarah Pendley conferred with the Board Counsel for Vital Statistics. No solution could be reached. An emergency bill required a process to enable CNMs and LDEMs to inunediately file information for birth certificates with Vital Statistics following a home birth. This bill has passed. Quarterly Report to Board of Nursing Direct-Entry Midwifery Advisory Committee -3\u00ad On April 7 a directive from Vital Statistics outlining corrective procedures for filing of home births was received by Richard Proctor. It was immediately disseminated to all licensed Direct\u00ad Entry Midwives at the request of Vital Statistics. It is our understanding that Vital Statistics sent the directive to all Certified Nurse Midwives. The CNMs and LDEMs do not feel this new process follows the language of the recently passed bill. The American Academy for Nurse Midwives is attempting to resolve the problem with The Public Health Agency ofDHMH. Continuing Education With the renewal date of October 28, 2017 for presently licensed OEMs, the Committee must enact their continuing education process. Renewal Application The renewal application for Direct-Entry Midwives is in the process of being readied for printing. For small groups of licensees such as Electrology and OEMs, paper applications are mailed two months prior to expiration of licenses. It is suggested that the OEMs renewal application be similar to the recently-printed Electrology applications with the additional requirement of attaching the Data Collection Form as required by statute. lOa CNA ADVISORY COMMITIEE Cheyenne Redd, Director of Licensure & Certification April 26, 2017 Participant roster indicating which seat the individual fills and date assigned to committee: MEMBER Nina Scheppske, Consumer member Susan Tandy, RN member Karen Evans, RN member Barbara Gough, RN member Debra Rowe, RN Member Sylvia Bunyasi, CMT member Carmen Young, RN member Wendy Shaffer-Yingling, DHMH rep Naomi Pilla, CNA member A'Lise Williams, Consumer Tasha Brown, are underway to obtain new members.
