These protocols represent the work of many people across the state and the continued evolution of prehospital medicine in Vermont. In this process, these protocols have been reviewed by and specific feedback has been received and incorporated from: Members of the Protocol Workgroup All 13 physicians who serve as District Medical Advisors Department of Mental Health Department of Children and Families Vermont State Police Office of the Chief Medical Examiner Howard Center Disability Rights Vermont Vermont Ethics Network Vermont Stroke Task Force Vermont American Heart Association Northern New England Poison Control Over 80 other EMS providers, agencies, and districts The Vermont Department of Health Division of Emergency Preparedness, Response and Injury Prevention has attempted to ensure that all information in these protocols is accurate and in accordance with the best medical evidence available and relevant professional guidelines as commonly practiced at the time of publication. Use of these protocols is intended for Vermont licensed EMS organizations and their affiliated licensed personnel functioning under Medical Direction. EMS District Medical Advisors may restrict but not expand the scope of practice at each level as outlined in these protocols. On occasion, drug shortages may require substitutions as communicated by the State EMS Medical Director. Vermont EMS personnel, instructors, and organizations are free to reproduce this document in whole or in part for educational, QA/QI, field guidance, or similar purposes. We continually scan for errors of all types (medication dosing, spelling, grammar, or punctuation), clarify wording that may be confusing, incorporate feedback from EMS providers, and monitor medical literature to keep abreast of current EMS practice. Please contact the EMS office with any suggestions for future revisions or corrections at vtems@vermont.gov All licensed providers functioning within the Vermont EMS system are required to be familiar with the contents of this document pertinent to their level of training and licensure. Updates to these protocols prior to the next full revision will be posted on the Vermont EMS website and sent via email to all agency heads, district chairs, and district medical advisors. Agency heads are responsible for assuring that any updates are provided to their affiliated personnel and any required training and credentialing occurs. Any updates will also be sent to all licensed EMS providers that have provided Vermont EMS with a valid email address and are on the Vermont EMS listserv. Contact the office to add your email address to this listserv if you do not already receive periodic updates. When using an electronic version of this document, you will find hyperlinks to each referenced protocol.Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. Preface IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS Protocol Implementation These protocols are written for the National EMS Scope of Practice Model levels: EMR, EMT, AEMT, Paramedic, and for the Vermont Emergency First Responder (VEFR) certification. When an entire agency has completed training on these protocols, they may begin to use these new protocols. Appendix 4 contains the scope of practice matrix. VEFR Scope of Practice For the Vermont Emergency First Responder (VEFR) certification, the scope of practice is based upon the American Heart Association HeartSaver First Aid, CPR & AED course. The primary focus of the Vermont Emergency First Responder is to initiate immediate lifesaving care to critical patients. This individual possesses the basic knowledge and skills necessary to provide lifesaving interventions while awaiting additional EMS response and to assist higher level personnel at the scene and during transport. Vermont Emergency First Responders function as part of a comprehensive EMS response, under medical oversight. Vermont Emergency First Responders perform basic interventions with minimal equipment. The skills and interventions of the VEFR scope of practice are described in the VEFR Routine Patient Care section of this document. EMR Scope of Practice The skills and interventions of the EMR scope of practice are described in the EMR Routine Patient Care section of this document. Protocol Labeling Protocols that are labeled #.A or #.P indicate the adult and pediatric versions of that protocol when appropriate. If no designation is listed and it is not obvious (such as newborn resuscitation), the protocol applies to both adult and pediatric patients. Standing Orders Are Cumulative Standing orders are those orders that may be carried out by an EMS provider - at their discretion - without the need for on -line Medical Direction. However, EMS providers at any level of training are encouraged to contact on -line Medical Direction in cases where they believe treatment beyond standing orders is warranted, cases where there is uncertainty regarding treatment or in cases involving medicolegal or jurisdictional issues. The standing orders for AEMTs and Paramedics inherently include the standing orders of the lower levels. The sequence of standing orders as they appear in these protocols is not necessarily the order in which they might be executed by a provider. Calling for Advanced Life Support Throughout the protocols, in any case where an AEMT or Paramedic can provide interventions beyond those of an EMT, the protocol indicates, \"Call for paramedic intercept, if available. If paramedic intercept is not available, call for AEMT intercept, if available. \" When the protocol says call for Paramedic or AEMT intercept, it means consider obtaining an intercept based upon the 20232023Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. Preface clinical situation and availability. The intent of this statement is to indicate those clinical situations where a paramedic can provide assessment and interventions beyond those of an AEMT and those situations where an AEMT can provide assessment and interventions beyond those of an EMT. Nothing in these protocols should be interpreted as requiring paramedic level care on certain calls or statewide. When paramedic care is available in the system that has been established locally whether through that agency 's own personnel or through mutual aid or intercept agreement, the protocols indicate which clinical situations should receive that level of care. The same principle applies to the statement of when to call for an AEMT. Transfer of Care When transferring care of a patient, an on -duty EMS provider must ensure the receiving caregiver is licensed at an equal or higher level unless the patient 's condition and reasonably anticipated complications can be effectively managed by a lower level provider 's scope of practice. For example, a paramedic who is a member of a first responder agency may transfer care of a patient with an uncomplicated ankle injury to an EMT for transport. On the other hand, a patient who receives interventions at a higher level on the scene shall only have care transferred to the same or higher level provider. Example 1: A Paramedic with a first responder agency treats a patient with an uncomplicated broken toe, but does not administer any narcotic analgesia or provide other paramedic -level interventions beyond assessment. There is no reasonable expectation that the patient may need advanced interventions during transport. Care may be transferred to an AEMT - or EMT - level crew on the ambulance service which responds. Example 2: An AEMT that is off -duty and outside of their normal response area assists as a bystander on a patient that has a seizure. Since this provider is off -duty and does not carry medications or other devices which require a physician order on their person, they have provided no AEMT -level care to the patient beyond assessment. The care of this patient may be transferred to the EMT -level crew that is responsible for the jurisdiction. Example 3: An AEMT that responds with a first -responder agency arrives on the scene of a cardiac arrest and begins treatment including starting an IV or IO. The ambulance service that responds has EMT -level providers. Care may not be transferred to the EMT crew. The AEMT or higher provider must transport with the patient to the hospital. Requests for Out -of-Scope Procedures Please note that while Medical Direction may have some variation from facility to facility, on -line Medical Direction may not direct providers to practice outside their scope of practice. Likewise, providers should not ask to perform procedures outside their scope of practice as defined within these protocols. Providers that perform a procedure outside their scope of practice risk the loss of their EMS licensure. Medication and Equipment Options Multiple medications are sometimes listed within a protocol and multiple options for some medical equipment are provided (eg. LMA, i -gel, King -LT, different types of Intraosseous devices, etc.). This is intended to provide Medical Direction and agencies with options for treatment and help deal with inevitable medication shortages. This should not be interpreted as 2023Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. Preface Medication and Equipment Options (continued) requiring agencies to stock all of the medications or devices listed in a given classification. As an example, agencies may choose to stock only one benzodiazepine or may choose to stock multiple options. When a medication becomes unavailable to an agency and there is no alternative listed in these protocols, the agency head or designee should contact the Vermont EMS office in a timely fashion. The state Medical Director will work with the agency, hospital, and other parties to identify and approve appropriate alternatives and any training that may be required for a medication not usually listed or approved. Extended Care Protocols Throughout the document you will find sections in relevant protocols identified with an \"X\" in blue. These are intended to be used in remote settings where transport will be significantly delayed or impossible due to wilderness or disaster settings. These are not intended for transports of normal travel distance and time. Incident Command Incident command will be structured in accordance with the Incident Command System (ICS) of the National Incident Management System (NIMS). Off-Duty EMS Personnel These protocols apply statewide. EMS providers that are bystanders when off duty outside the normal response area of their affiliated agency should provide BLS care and notify 911. Once the agency with jurisdiction arrives, care should be transferred. On-Duty EMS Crews Outside of Normal Response Area These protocols apply statewide and therefore cover mutual aid responses as well as incidental patient contact regardless of where in Vermont it occurs. Example 1: ABC Rescue squad comes across a car crash while returning to their station after transporting to a hospital that is in a different EMS district. ABC Rescue follows these statewide protocols. Example 2: XYZ Fire/Rescue is called to provide mutual aid into a different EMS district on a mass -casualty call. XYZ Fire/Rescue follows these statewide protocols. Protocol Determination Regarding State Borders Ambulance services that are licensed in Vermont and a bordering state shall follow the protocols of the state where patient contact is made, regardless of the destination. Ambulance services that are licensed in Vermont only shall follow these Vermont protocols at all times. Continuous Quality Improvement Quality improvement permeates every aspect of our lives ... we strive for a better outcome with each decision. The Vermont Statewide EMS Protocols are no different. With each edition, we endeavor to make them better than they were before, knowing that we will improve and refine them in the future as evidence, experience and technology dictate. 2023Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

Use Incident Command System (ICS) for all responses and scene management. SCENE ARRIVAL AND SIZE -UP Standard precautions, scene safety, environmental hazards assessment, number of patients, need for additional resources, and bystander safety. Initiate Mass Casualty Incident procedures as necessary. Call for Paramedic intercept, if available, for patients with unstable vital signs, respiratory distress or other life -threatening conditions. If Paramedic intercept is not available, call for AEMT intercept, if available. PATIENT APPROACH Determine mechanism of injury / nature of illness. If patient is in cardiac arrest refer to Cardiac Arrest - 3.2A, or Cardiac Arrest - 3.2P. Determine if pediatric protocols apply. \"Pediatric Patient \" is defined as a child who fits on a length -based resuscitation tape up to 36 kg (79 lbs) or 145 cm (57 in). Vermont EMS strongly encourages the use of a pediatric reference system when treating pediatric patients. Agencies should adopt and train with a system that uses weight, length, or age to identify normal ranges of vital signs and appropriate equipment sizes. The system should also identify pediatric medication doses by volume and minimize the need for medication math. Establish responsiveness. General Impression. Determine if DNR/COLST protocol applies ( Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) & Clinical Orders (COLST) - 8.7). AIRWAY AND BREATHING Airway Assess breathing: rate, effort, tidal volume, and breath sounds. o If breathing is inadequate, ventilate with 100% oxygen using bag -valve -mask. o Administer oxygen to address signs of hypoxia. o Assess lung sounds and chest. CIRCULATION ASSESSMENT Assess patient 's circulation including pulse, skin signs and capillary refill time. Control serious bleeding using direct pressure, pressure bandages, tourniquets, or hemostatic bandages ( Tourniquet & Hemostatic Agent - Adult & Pediatric 6.6) . DISABILITY ASSESSMENT Assess level of consciousness appropriate for age. Utilize spinal motion restriction if patient has a mechanism of injury that could cause a spinal injury (Spinal Trauma and Assessment - 4.6). SECONDARY/FOCUSED ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT Obtain chief complaint, history of present illness, and prior medical history. Complete a physical assessment as appropriate for the patient 's presentation. Refer to appropriate protocol(s) for further treatment options. Determine level of pain.2013SECONDARY/FOCUSED ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT (CONTINUED) Dress and bandage lacerations and abrasions. Cover evisceration with a sterile dressing to prevent heat loss. Maintain normal body temperature. Stabilize impaled objects. Do not remove an impaled object unless it interferes with CPR or your ability to maintain the patient 's airway. Monitor vital signs at least every 15 minutes (at least every 5 minutes if the patient is unstable). Perform basic splinting as indicated.

Use lights and sirens when responding, as appropriate per emergency medical dispatch information and local guidelines (Safe Response and Transportation Guidelines - 8.18). Use Incident Command System (ICS) for all responses and scene management. SCENE ARRIVAL AND SIZE -UP Standard precautions, scene safety, environmental hazards assessment, number of patients, need for additional resources, and bystander safety. Initiate Mass Casualty Incident procedures as necessary. Call for Paramedic intercept, if available, for patients with unstable vital signs, respiratory distress or other life - threatening conditions. If Paramedic intercept is not available, call for AEMT intercept, if available. PATIENT APPROACH Determine mechanism of injury / nature of illness. If patient is in cardiac arrest, refer to the Cardiac Arrest - 3.2A, or Cardiac Arrest - 3.2P. Determine if pediatric protocols apply. \"Pediatric Patient \" is defined as a child who fits on a length - based resuscitation tape up to 36 kg (79 lbs) or 145 cm (57 in). Vermont EMS strongly encourages the use of a pediatric reference system when treating pediatric patients. Agencies should adopt and train with a system that uses weight, length, or age to identify normal ranges of vital signs and appropriate equipment sizes. The system should also identify pediatric medication doses by volume and minimize the need for medication math. Contact Medical Direction in case any uncertainty exists regarding drug dosing. Establish responsiveness. General impression. Determine if DNR/COLST protocol applies ( Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) & Clinical Orders (COLST) - 8.7). AIRWAY AND BREATHING Airway o Assess the patient for a patent airway. If the airway is not patent, take immediate action to correct it. Assess breathing: rate, effort, tidal volume, and breath sounds. o Ensure a patent airway using appropriate positioning and adjuncts (OPA/NPA). Ensure adequate oxygenation (94 - 98%) and ventilation using supplemental oxygen and bag -valve mask (BVM) when appropriate. If possible, elevate patient 's head 30 degrees and prepare suction to avoid aspiration. o Consider waveform capnography (i.e., EtCO 2) and/or CO -oximetry, if available. o Assess lung sounds and chest. CIRCULATION ASSESSMENT Assess patient 's circulation including pulse, skin signs and capillary refill time. Control serious bleeding using direct pressure, pressure bandages, tourniquets, and/or hemostatic bandages. See Tourniquet & Hemostatic Agent - Adult & Pediatric 6.6 . Establish IV access and fluid resuscitation as appropriate for the patient 's condition. o For adult patients, administer fluids to maintain systolic blood pressure ( Shock - 2.24A) . o For pediatric patients, administer fluids based on physiological signs and therapeutic end -points ( Shock - 2.24P) . Administer IV fluid using a volume -controlled device/method such as an inline 3 -way stopcock or similar device. o Consider obtaining a blood sample, per receiving hospital 's preference. Note: An AEMT may draw a blood sample during an IV initiation, but must first be trained and credentialed by their agency and hospital. NOTE : An IV for the purposes of these protocols is a saline lock or intravenous line with 0.9% NaCl (normal saline), unless otherwise specified in an individual protocol. Routes of medication administration when written as \"IV\" can also include \"IO\". Lactated Ringers may be used as a direct substitute for Normal Saline, except when administering certain medications. See Vermont Adult Medication Reference - A4.2013DISABILITY ASSESSMENT Assess level of consciousness appropriate for age; use Glasgow Coma Scale for trauma. If altered level of consciousness, check finger stick blood glucose via glucometer. Utilize spinal motion restriction if indicated by assessment, see Spinal Trauma and Assessment - 4.6. For pediatric patients requiring spinal motion restriction, see Pediatric Transportation - 8.13. TRANSPORT DECISION In general, patients should be transported to the closest appropriate hospital. Operational needs and/or patient preference should be considered. The destination hospital and mode of transport are determined by the EMS provider with the highest medical level providing patient care. Regionalized systems of care for STEMI, stroke and trauma patients may necessitate transport to a hospital beyond the nearest facility. Notify receiving facility as early as possible. Lights and sirens should be justified by the need for immediate medical intervention that is beyond the capabilities of the ambulance crew using available supplies and equipment. Use of lights and sirens should be documented on the patient care report. Exceptions can be made under extraordinary circumstances. Consider aeromedical transportation when indicated by patient acuity and ground transport time ( Air Medical Transport - 8.0, and Trauma Triage and Transport Decision - 4.9. SECONDARY/FOCUSED ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT Obtain chief complaint, history of present illness, and prior medical history. If indicated, perform single question Drug Use Screening Test by asking: o \"In the past year, have you used substances or prescription medications for non -medical or recreational reasons? \" o If the answer is yes, the patient is an At -Risk Person ( Naloxone Leave -Behind Overdose Rescue Program - 8.11) Complete a physical assessment as appropriate for the patient 's presentation. Refer to appropriate protocol(s) for further treatment options. Determine level of pain. Consider field diagnostic tests including: cardiac monitoring, obtain and transmit 12 -lead ECG, blood glucose, temperature, stroke assessment, pulse oximetry, waveform capnography, point -of-care ultrasound, etc. Dress and bandage lacerations and abrasions. Cover evisceration with a sterile dressing to prevent heat loss. Maintain normal body temperature. Stabilize impaled objects. Do not remove an impaled object unless it interferes with CPR or your ability to maintain the patient 's airway. Monitor vital signs at least every 15 minutes (at least every 5 minutes if the patient is unstable). MAJOR MULTIPLE SYSTEM TRAUMA Traumatic Emergencies - 4.12. CIRCUMSTANCES NOT COVERED UNDER STATEWIDE EMS PROTOCOLS It is impossible to write a protocol for every potential situation. In rare instances where the patient 's best interests may not be specifically addressed in a protocol, contact on -line Medical Direction . Please note that while Medical Direction can have some variation from facility to facility, on -line Medical Direction may not direct providers to practice outside their scope of practice, and likewise, providers should not ask to perform procedures outside their scope of practice as defined within these protocols.Routine Patient Care EMT / AEMT / Paramedic 1.2 Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 2023When Vermont 's EMS providers treat patients in remote or difficult environments and ambulance transport to hospital care is significantly delayed, it may be necessary to provide extended patient care. Extended care applies to any low resource setting where access to definitive care is delayed or impossible. This may be due to a remote location or infrastructure destruction. Extended care patients may require repeat administration of medications beyond what is specified in regular protocols or assistance with administration of the patient 's prescribed medication. In an extended care environment, EMS providers will follow the following guidelines: 1. Every effort should be made to contact Medical Direction for guidance. 2. If Medical Direction is unavailable, it is reasonable to administer repeat medication dosing at the same intervals as prescribed in protocol or as prescribed for patient 's own medications. Caution must be used due to cumulative effects that may result in over -sedation, hypotension, respiratory depression, etc. 3. If changes to regular protocol are necessary for medication use in extended care situations, these changes appear in the specific protocol under a separate Extended Care Section denoted by an: 4.Interventions performed during extended care circumstances must remain within the provider 's scope of practice. Special circumstances to consider in an extended care environment: Protecting the patient from the environment while awaiting extrication and/or transport. This may require an improvised shelter and insulation to protect the patient and providers from rain, snow and wind. Requesting additional resources/personnel early if an extended care call is suspected. Oral fluids to maintain a patient 's hydration and high energy foods to maintain caloric requirements, if the patient is conscious and able to swallow. Limited resources due to difficulty accessing patient and/or transporting equipment to the patient 's location. These resources may include: o Oxygen o Suction o Cardiac Monitor/AED o Pulse Oximetry o Capnography o Glucose Meter o BP Cuff and Stethoscope o Intravenous access o Medications o Communication with online Medical DirectionX1.3 Routine Patient Care.. Maintain the patient NPO (nothing by mouth). Allow patient to assume a position of comfort. Acquire and transmit 12 -lead ECG, if available, for patients age 40. Minimize scene time. If patient has uncontrolled pain, unstable vital signs, or signs and symptoms of an acute abdomen, call for Paramedic intercept, if available. If not available, call for AEMT intercept. PEARLS: Common causes of acute abdominal pain may appendicitis, cholecystitis, bowel perforation, diverticulitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and pancreatitis. It is important to remember that abdominal pain can be caused by a number of different disease processes. Pain may originate from the esophagus, stomach, intestinal tract, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, male or female reproductive organs or urinary bladder. Referred pain from the chest may involve the heart, lungs and pleura. Lower abdominal pain in women of child bearing age should be treated as an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. Myocardial infarction can present with upper abdominal pain especially in the diabetic and elderly. DKA may present with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.PAEEMT STANDING ORDERS ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS Abdominal Pain (Non Traumatic) Adult & Pediatric Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

XHyperglycemic emergency is defined as blood glucose greater than or equal to 250 mg/dL with associated signs and symptoms, such as altered mental status, increased respiratory rate, or dehydration. PEARLS: In pediatric patients, use 10 mL/kg fluid bolus to avoid potential risk of cerebral edema. New onset DKA in pediatric patients commonly presents with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or urinary frequency. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life -threatening emergency defined as uncontrolled hyperglycemia with the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis. Signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include uncontrolled blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL, weakness, altered mental status, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, polyuria (excessive urination) polydipsia (excessive thirst), a fruity odor on the breath (from ketones) and tachypnea. Common causes of diabetic ketoacidosis include infection, acute coronary syndrome and medication non - compliance. Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Nonketotic Syndrome (HHNS) is characterized by blood glucose levels greater than 600 mg/dL and profound dehydration with significant neurologic deficits (e.g., coma, altered mental status). Treatment is the same in the field as it is for DKA. Hyperglycemia may be detrimental to patients at risk for cerebral ischemia such as victims of stroke, cardiac arrest and head trauma. Overly aggressive administration of fluid in hyperglycemic patients may cause cerebral edema or dangerous hyponatremia. Closely monitor for signs of altered mental status, increased intracranial pressure, and immediately discontinue IV fluids and elevate head of bed if signs of increased ICP develop. If patient has continuous glucose monitor, EMS should confirm glucose measurement with own equipment.

D10% could benefit patients in controlling their post - treatment high blood sugar levels. Causes of hypoglycemia include medication misuse or overdose, missed meal, infection, cardiovascular insults (e.g., myocardial infarction, arrhythmia), or changes in activity (e.g., exercise). Diabetics are not the only persons who become hypoglycemic. Alcoholics, some poisoned patients, and others may develop problems of glucose metabolism. Oral anti -hyperglycemic toxicity can last up to 72 hours, especially sulfonylurea (e.g., glyburide, glipizide). Patients with corrected hypoglycemia who are taking these agents are at particular risk for recurrent hypoglycemia and frequently require hospital admission. These patients should be evaluated in the Emergency Department. When administering dextrose, monitor IV site for signs of extravasation.AEMT/Paramedic: If patient has a severe hypoglycemic emergency with altered mental status or seizures and the provider is unable to establish IV access, the provider may administer dextrose via intraosseous (IO), Intraosseous Access - 6.2.EMT STANDING ORDERS ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS A/PA/PDiabetic Emergencies (Hypoglycemia) Adult Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

It is often difficult to quantify blood loss with epistaxis. Ninety percent (90%) of nosebleeds are anterior in etiology, with blood draining from one or both nares. However, posterior bleeding may be present. Posterior epistaxis is identified by blood draining into the posterior pharynx. Risk factors for severe epistaxis include use (Plavix), and tricagrelor (Brilinta), and use of over -the-counter headache relief medications. Therefore, it is essential to obtain a complete medical history. If hypotensive, assess for shock ( Shock - 2.24A , or Shock - 2.24P ): o Establish IV access. o ADULT: Administer 250 mL boluses of 0.9% NaCl to maintain mental status and peripheral perfusion, and to maintain a MAP 65 mmHg (systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg). Total volume should not exceed 2,000mL. Contact Medical Direction after first 1,000mL. o PEDIATRIC: Administer 20 mL/kg of 0.9% NaCl to maintain mental status, peripheral perfusion, and capillary refill.

Epistaxis in the context of mulitsystem trauma, include considerations for facial injuries ( Traumatic Brain Injury - Adult & Pediatric 4.10 ) Exertional Heat Stroke (EHS) is a unique and emergent hyperthermic condition that occurs in individuals performing intense physical activity, typically not limited to warm environments. INDICATION Consider EHS in any intensely -exercising athlete, laborer, fire, police or EMS personnel with altered mental status. PROTOCOL 1. Perform rapid routine assessment (<5 minutes). Assess for other causes of AMS, including but not limited to hypoxia, hypoglycemia, inadequate perfusion, head injury or seizure. 2. Consider EHS in any intensely -exercising athlete, laborer, fire, police or EMS personnel with altered mental status. 3. If EHS has been confirmed and appropriate cooling has been initiated by an appropriate onsite medical team, athletic trainer, coach, or instructor, DO NOT interrupt cooling for assessment or transport. 4. If care has not been initiated and EHS is suspected, immediately perform a rectal temperature (T REC). 5. If T REC is at or above 40\u00baC (104\u00baF), initiate immediate rapid cooling to a temperature less than 40\u00baC within 30 minutes of collapse. a. Best practice for cooling an EHS patient is whole -body cold water immersion from the neck down. b. Immersion in ice water -filled body bag or tarp may also yield acceptable cooling rates. c. Ice packs, fans, cold water dousing or shower do not achieve acceptable cooling rates. Rotating ice water towels covering as much of the body surface area as possible should be considered a minimum cooling modality enroute. 6. Discontinue cooling at 39\u00baC (102\u00baF). If a T REC is not available, cooling should not be interrupted or delayed in cases of suspected EHS. Cool for a minimum of 20 minutes / clinical improvement if resources available on scene, or transport with best available active cooling method (body bag with ice water or rotating ice water -soaked towels). 7. Do not interrupt cooling for diarrhea, emesis, combativeness, or seizures. IV/IM medications are rarely needed. 8. Transport to closest receiving facility and notify that EHS is suspected.

Consider hyperkalemia in patients with wide -complex bradycardia. Hyperkalemia patients may deteriorate rapidly. Consider calling for ALS early and prepare for cardiac arrest if bradycardia is present.Calcium chloride is irritating to veins and must not be injected into tissues, since severe necrosis and sloughing may occur. Administer slowly, taking great care to avoid extravasation or accidental injection into perivascular tissues. Routine Patient Care. Consider exertional heat stroke in any intensely -exercising athlete, laborer, fire, police or EMS personnel, etc. with altered mental status ( Exertional Heat Stroke - 2.10) . Move victim to a cool area and shield from the sun or any external heat source. Remove as much clothing as is practical and loosen any restrictive garments. If alert and oriented, give small sips of cool liquids. Monitor and record vital signs and level of consciousness. If altered mental status, check blood glucose level. Determine patient 's core temperature, if possible (rectal temperature preferred). If thermometer not available, assume heat stroke if altered mental status present. Diagnosis of hyperthermia is based on clinical signs. If temperature is 40\u00baC (104\u00baF) or if altered mental status is present, begin active cooling by: o Whole -body cold water immersion from the neck down. Note: Elderly patients are less able to withstand sudden shocks, so begin with less aggressive cooling measures like misting or cool wet cloths. When you reassess the patient, if there is little or no improvement, use more aggressive measures o Continually misting the exposed skin with tepid water while fanning patient o Rotating ice water towels covering as much of the body surface area as possible Discontinue active cooling if shivering occurs that cannot be managed by Paramedics (see below) or temperature is < 38.9\u00baC (102\u00ba F). Call for Paramedic intercept, if available. If not available, call for AEMT intercept. Establish IV access. Administer 500 mL 0.9% NaCl room temperature or chilled IV fluid bolus for dehydration even if vital signs are normal.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 2.13 PEARLS: A hypothermic patient should be assessed for coexisting injuries or illnesses that may mimic or conceal the signs and symptoms of hypothermia. The use of vital signs, mental status and presence or absence of shivering may be unreliable if the patient has another condition that coexists with hypothermia. o Many conditions such as hypoglycemia, alcohol intoxication and exhaustion can cause altered mental status and can decrease or abolish shivering. o A heart rate higher than expected for a given level of hypothermia may be due to another cause such as traumatic blood loss. A rapid assessment of the patient 's core temperature may be performed by placing a warm ungloved hand against the skin of a patient 's back, or chest. If the skin feels warm, hypothermia is unlikely. Due to the extremely low metabolic needs in severe hypothermia a heart rate of just a few beats per minute is enough to provide adequate perfusion to vital organs. o It is best to attempt to maintain this amount of cardiac activity rather than to start CPR and cause ventricular fibrillation (VF). Rough handling of hypothermic patients may cause cardiac arrhythmias, including VF Hypothermic patients are often significantly dehydrated and may require repeat fluid boluses. Owing to the decrease in cerebral oxygen requirements with cooling, survival without neurologic impairment may be possible even when it is necessary to perform CPR for hours. Transportation to CPB/ECMO capable facilities with continuing CPR may be justified if hypothermia is present or suspected. Contact destination hospital in advance to ensure availability of CPB/ECMO. Patients with MAP < 65 (SBP < 90mmHg) or ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest should be transported directly to a center capable of providing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if feasible. 2023PEARLS : To reduce incidence of akathisia or dystonic reactions, administer prochlorperazine, metoclopramide or droperidol slowly, over 1 - 2 minutes.

Preterm labor: onset of labor/contractions prior to the 37th week of gestation. Malpresentation: presentation of the fetal buttocks or limbs. Prolapsed umbilical cord: umbilical cord precedes the fetus. Shoulder dystocia: failure of the fetal shoulder to deliver shortly after delivery of the head. Postpartum hemorrhage: active bleeding after uterine massage and oxytocin administration. Pre-eclampsia/Eclampsia: BP > 160/100, severe headache, visual disturbances, edema, RUQ pain, seizures. Discourage pushing by the mother Place mother in knee -chest or Trendelenberg position. Place a gloved hand into the mother 's vagina and decompress the umbilical cord by elevating the presenting fetal part off of the cord. Wrap cord in warm, sterile saline soaked dressing. Place mother in knee -chest or Trendelenberg position. Do not attempt delivery; transport emergently as surgery is likely. For breech birth (presentation of buttock): Do not pull on newborn; support newborn and allow delivery to proceed normally. If the legs have delivered, gently elevate the trunk and legs to aid delivery of the head. If the head is not delivered within 30 seconds of the legs, place two fingers into the vagina to locate the infant 's mouth. Press the vaginal wall away from the infant 's mouth to maintain the fetal airway. For third trimester bleeding Suspect placenta previa (placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment). Suspect placental abruption (placenta is separated from the uterine wall before delivery); because hemorrhage may occur into the pelvic cavity, shock can develop despite relatively little vaginal bleeding. Do not perform digital examination. Place patient in the left lateral position. Monitor hemodynamic stability ( Shock - 2.24A ). Routine Patient Care. Do not delay transport for patients with obstetrical emergencies, provide early notification to the receiving facility. If gestational age is known to be < 20 weeks, transport to closest hospital. If gestational age is known to be > 20 weeks or fundus is palpable at or above the umbilicus, contact Medical Direction regarding destination determination.E For shoulder dystocia: Suspect if newborn 's head delivers normally and then retracts back into perineum because shoulders are trapped. Discourage pushing by the mother Support the baby 's head, do not pull on it. Suction the nasopharyx and oropharynx, as needed Position mother with buttocks dropped off end of stretcher and thighs flexed upward (McRobe rt's position). Apply firm pressure with an open hand immediately above pubic symphysis (McRobert 's maneuver).

Status epilepticus is defined as any generalized seizure lasting more than 5 minutes. This is a true emergency requiring rapid airway control, treatment (including benzodiazepines), and transport. Any seizure still present upon EMS arrival and/or lasting more than 5 minutes should be treated with benzodiazepines. The preferred initial dose of benzodiazepine is midazolam IM/intranasal. After initial dose, establish an IV in case additional medication doses are needed. If an IV is already established, administer benzodiazepine IV.E AE ASeizures Pediatric Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

PEARLS: Syncope is defined as a loss of consciousness accompanied by a loss of postural tone with spontaneous recovery. In near syncope the patient feels like they are about to pass out but does not have an actual loss of consciousness. Consider all syncope to be of cardiac origin until proven otherwise. While often thought as benign, syncope can be the sign of more serious medical emergency. All patients with syncope deserve emergency department evaluation, even if they appear normal with few complaints on scene. Syncope that occurs during exercise often indicates an ominous cardiac cause. Patients should be evaluated at the ED. Syncope that occurs following exercise is almost always vasovagal and benign. Prolonged QTc (generally > 500ms), Brugada Syndrome (incomplete RBBB pattern in V1/V2 with ST segment elevation), Delta waves and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy should be considered in all patients. Syncope can be indicative of many medical emergencies including: Perform cardiac monitoring. Observe for and treat dysrhythmias as indicated. Perform cardiac monitoring.

PEARLS: Hyperkalemia should be suspected in dialysis or renal failure patients with ECG changes such as tall peaked T waves, loss of P waves, QRS widening and bradycardia ( Hyperkalemia - 2.11A ). When pushed too quickly, glucagon can cause nausea and vomiting. Consider serious/symptomatic bradycardia in adults with heart rates <50 beats per minute with symptoms including hypot ension, altered mental status, syncope, chest pain, dizziness, or other signs of shock.PEARLS: In children, bradycardia almost always reflects hypoxia, rather than a primary cardiac problem. It is a pre - arrest rhythm, and the prognosis is poor if left untreated. Immediate delivery of high -flow oxygen and assisted ventilation are essential. Untreated bradycardia will quickly cause shock, hypotension and death. Combine age -specific heart rates with signs of respiratory failure and shock while assessing.

Minimize interruptions in chest compression, as pauses rapidly return the blood pressure to zero and stop perfusion to the heart and brain. Delay application of mechanical CPR devices until after the first four cycles (8 minutes) of CPR and decision to transport. Mechanical devices should only be used by services that are practiced and skilled at their application, with minimal interruption to compressions. Switch compressors every two minutes to minimize fatigue. Perform chest compressions while defibrillator is charging and resume compressions immediately after the shock is delivered to avoid excessive interruptions in CPR. When possible, use live CPR feedback devices and voice recorder to facilitate high -quality CPR. Naloxone generally has no role in the management of cardiac arrest. However, if the cardiac arrest is due to a suspected opioid overdose, administer a trial dose of naloxone, as it can be difficult to discern true cardiac arrest from an opioid overdose patient with deep CNS and cardiovascular depression. Do not delay or defer other treatments such as CPR, ventilation and oxygenation. Consider limiting doses of epinephrine for refractory ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia to avoid hyperstimulation of myocardium.

Maximum dose of 400 mcg/min If patient improves after SL nitroglycerin, may apply nitroglycerin paste 1\" - 2\" transdermally. Confirm pulmonary edema using point -of-care ultrasound, if available and credentialed. Routine Patient Care. Place the patient in a semi -sitting or full sitting position. Contact Medical Direction for online order to facilitate administration of the patient 's own nitroglycerin, while symptoms persist and systolic BP is 140 mmHg. Acquire and transmit 12 -lead ECG, if available. Call for Paramedic intercept, if available. If not available, call for AEMT intercept. PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS PEARLS: Nitroglycerin is the first -line medication for congestive heart failure. Furosemide and Narcotics have NOT been shown to improve the outcomes of EMS patients with pulmonary edema. If patient has taken nitroglycerin without relief, consider loss of potency due to age. If Nitropaste is used, do not continue to use Nitroglycerin SL unless symptoms worsen.

Clear some space to optimize your working environment. Move furniture or get the patient in a position that will allow a rescuer space to kneel on both sides of them, and where there is sufficient room at the head. Effectiveness of chest compressions decreases during patient movement. Therefore resuscitate the patient as close to the scene as operationally feasible. Position 1 and 2 are ideally set up on opposite sides of patient 's chest and perform continuous chest compressions, alternating every 2 minutes to avoid fatigue.

(For example, a patient who fell and has been on the floor for 2 days) Compartment syndrome: A localized rapid rise of tension within a muscle compartment, which inevitably leads to metabolic disturbances akin to rhabdomyolysis. Crush syndrome : Involves a series of metabolic changes produced due to an injury of the skeletal muscles of such a severity as to cause a disruption of cellular integrity and release of its contents into the circulation. Suspension syndrome: A state of shock caused by blood pooling in dependent lower extremities while the body is held upright without any movement for a period of time. May lead to a relative hypovolemic state and cardiovascular collapse. Causes of mortality in untreated crush syndrome: o Immediate: severe head injury, traumatic asphyxia, torso injury with intrathoracic or intra -abdominal organ injury Early: hyperkalemia, hypovolemia/shock, Late: renal failure, coagulopathy, hemorrhage and sepsis Suspect hyperkalemia if T waves become peaked, QRS prolonged > 0.12 seconds, absent P waves, or prolonged QTc. Hyperkalemia may be delayed up to 24 hours after extrication. A patient with a crush injury may initially present with very few signs and symptoms, therefore, maintain a high index of suspicion for any patient with a compressive mechanism of injury.

Victims with only respiratory arrest usually respond after a few artificial breaths are given. o Give a few breaths and check for a pulse; anticipate vomiting For patients in cardiac arrest, provide immediate CPR. o Start with airway and breathing before compressions Routine stabilization of the cervical spine in the absence of circumstances that suggest a spinal injury is not recommended. o If c-spine injury is suspected ( Spinal Trauma and Assessment - 4.6) Obtain specific history: time, temperature, associated trauma, etc. Begin resuscitation efforts while removing the patient from the water. Consider hypothermia ( Hypothermia - Adult & Pediatric - 2.13). Remove wet clothes and warm the patient. All patients with history of submersion should be transported to the hospital. Reassure anxious patient. If water temperature is estimated to be less than 6oC (43oF) and submerged: o Less than 90 minutes: Initiate full resuscitation o Greater than 90 minutes: Consider not initiating resuscitation or termination of efforts, contact Medical Direction for guidance If water temperature is estimated to be greater than 6oC (43oF) and submerged: o Less than 30 minutes: Initiate full resuscitation o Greater than 30 minutes: Consider not initiating resuscitation or termination of efforts; contact Medical Direction for guidance Call for Paramedic intercept, if available. If not available, call for AEMT intercept. PEARLS: There is no need to clear the airway of aspirated water; only a modest amount of water is aspirated by most drowning victims, and aspirated water is rapidly absorbed into the central circulation. Unnecessary cervical spine immobilization can impede adequate opening of the airway and delay delivery of rescue breaths. Patients with severe hypothermia may benefit from treatment at a facility capable of ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) or CardioPulmonary Bypass (CPB). Consider air medical transport. In hypothermic patients, low levels of ETCO2 may not be a useful predictor of outcome, due to reduced metabolism. Oral and tympanic thermometers do not yield an accurate core temperature for severely hypothermic patients. Cold water offers enhanced survival only where the patient becomes cold prior to cardiac arrest. SUBMERSION: When a patient goes under the water immediately, has a hypoxic cardiac arrest and then cools down. Prognosis considered dismal. IMMERSION: Patients are in the water with head above water and they continue to breathe while they cool down before they eventually arrest. Prognosis can be good with patients surviving after prolonged CPR. Do not attempt water or ice rescues unless properly trained and equipped. When operating on scenes involving water, use extreme caution and wear a PFD.ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS Consider advanced airway or intubation as indicated.A/E /PA/E /P PEARLS: Handle the tooth carefully.

Obtain visual acuity, if possible. Assist patient with the removal of contact lens, if applicable. Chemical irritants, including pepper spray, alkali, acid or other chemical exposure: o Flush with copious amounts of water, or 0.9% NaCl for a minimum of 20 minutes o Consider contacting Poison Control at (800) 222 -1222 as soon as practical for consultation Thermal burns to eyelids: patch both eyes with cool saline compress. Impaled object: immobilize object and patch both eyes. Do not apply pressure. Do not attempt to remove object. Puncture wound: place rigid protective device over both eyes (e.g., eye shield). Do not apply pressure. Foreign body: Minor foreign objects like dust or grit may be flushed with water or 0.9% NaCl. Patch both eyes. If the patient cannot close their eyelids, keep their eye moist with a sterile saline dressing. An anti -emetic is strongly recommended for penetrating or blunt eye trauma (Nausea/Vomiting - Adult & Pediatric 2.14 ). Refer to Pain Management - 2.20A , or Pain Management - 2.20P .

Women who are known or suspected to be pregnant with a fetus of viable gestational age ( > 24 weeks). Routine Patient Care Apply direct pressure , using manual control and/or pressure bandage. Apply limb tourniquet , if direct pressure is ineffective or impractical and for any traumatic amputation: o Apply directly to the skin 2 -3 inches above the bleeding site. If bleeding is not controlled with the first tourniquet, apply a second tourniquet just proximal to the first o Document time of tourniquet application and communicate this clearly with receiving facility Pack Wounds in anatomical areas where tourniquets cannot be applied and sustained direct pressure alone is ineffective or impractical (junctional/torso injury or proximal extremity location where tourniquet application is not practical). o Only utilize a topical hemostatic bandage in a gauze format that supports wound packing Junctional tourniquet o If the bleeding site is amenable to use of a junctional tourniquet, immediately apply device following manufacture 's guidelines, if available In the event of diminished scene safety (indirect threat, warm zone etc.), limb tourniquets should be placed as high on the limb as possible and over clothing. In the absence of a commercial tourniquet (preferred), an improvised device e.g., cravat with windlass, blood pressure cuff could be used. The device must be a minimum of 2 inches wide, otherwise it can cut through the skin.Hemorrhage Control Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20234.4 Amputations : Rinse severed part briefly and gently with sterile saline to remove debris then wrap severed part in sterile saline gauze, moisten with sterile saline (do not soak) and place in water -tight container. Place container on ice (do not use dry ice). Do not put part directly on ice. If necessary, use ice packs to provide some level of cooling. PEARLS: Tourniquets applied prior to EMS arrival should be evaluated for effectiveness and appropriateness. If tourniquet can be safely removed, remove the tourniquet and apply pressure dressing. Do not apply tourniquet over joints. Reassess for re -bleeding frequently, especially after any patient movement. Delay in placement of a tourniquet for life threatening hemorrhage significantly increases mortality. Do not wait for hemodynamic compromise to apply a tourniquet. If feasible, transport patients directly to a trauma center and provide earliest possible notification / trauma alert. Damage to the limb from tourniquet application is unlikely if removed in several hours.Direct pressure effective (hemorrhage controlled)Prehospital External Hemorrhage Control Protocol Apply direct pressure/pressure dressing to injury Direct pressure ineffective or impractical (hemorrhage not controlled) Wound amenable to tourniquet placement (e.g. extremity injury)Wound not amenable to tourniquet placement (e.g. torso injury) Apply a tourniquet or junctional tourniquet Apply a topical hemostatic agent with direct pressureApply direct pressure/pressure dressing to injury Direct pressure ineffective or impractical (hemorrhage not controlled) Wound amenable to tourniquet placement (e.g. extremity injury)Wound not amenable to tourniquet placement (e.g. torso injury) Apply a tourniquet or junctional tourniquet Apply a topical hemostatic agent with direct pressureMusculoskeletal Injuries Adult & Pediatric PEARLS: Use ample padding when splinting possible fractures, dislocations, sprains, and strains. Remove and secure all jewelry. Elevate injured extremities, if possible. Consider the application of a cold pack for 30 minutes. Musculoskeletal injuries can occur from blunt and penetrating trauma. Fractures of the pelvis and femur, as well as fractures or dislocations involving circulatory or neurological deficits, take priority over other musculoskeletal injuries. Hip dislocations, pelvic, knee, and elbow fractures / dislocations have a high incidence of vascular compromise. Do not manipulate pelvis once fracture is suspected. Repeated manipulation can increase internal hemorrhage.EMT STANDING ORDERS Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

Manually stabilize the injury. Control bleeding and treat for shock ( Tourniquet & Hemostatic Agent - Adult & Pediatric 6.6 Shock - 2.24A , or Shock - 2.24P . Remove obvious debris, irrigate open wounds with saline solution, and cover with moist sterile dressing. For significantly -angulated fractures, attempt to reposition to anatomical position of function, so long as the fracture is not at/near a joint. Assess CSMs distal to injury before and reassess every 15 minutes after immobilization: o Splint extremity as required o Traction splinting is preferred technique for isolated adult and pediatric mid - shaft femur fractures In a patient with a high -risk mechanism of injury ( Spinal Trauma and Assessment - 4.6). Stabilize suspected pelvic fractures with commercial device (preferred) or bed sheet: o It is preferable to use a scoop stretcher rather than to log -roll a patient with a suspected pelvic fracture o Amputations should be dressed with bulky dressings and assessed for uncontrolled bleeding ( Hemorrhage Control - 4.4) See Trauma Triage and Transport Decision - 4.9, and Pain Management - 2.20A , or Pain Management - 2.20P . Minimize scene time. Call for Paramedic intercept. If not available, call for AEMT intercept. ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS A PA PPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS For Patella dislocation, contact Medical Direction to consider reduction by exerting medially -directed pressure on lateral patellla while extending knee (VT approved training required). Consider pain control prior to procedure.PURPOSE: This protocol provides guidance regarding the assessment and care of patients who have a possible spinal injury. Routine Patient Care. Perform advanced spinal assessment to determine if patient requires spinal motion restriction. Maintain manual in -line stabilization during assessment, unless patient is alert and spontaneously moving neck. Minimize spinal movement during assessment and extrication. A long backboard, scoop stretcher, vacuum mattress, or other appropriate full length extrication device may be used for extrication if needed. Do not use short board or KED device, except for vertical extrication or other special situations. Apply adequate padding to prevent tissue ischemia and minimize discomfort. Advanced Spinal Assessment: Spinal motion restriction is required when ANY of the following conditions apply: Unreliable patient: o Child who cannot participate in assessment o Anxious and/or uncooperative o Communication barriers (e.g., deafness, hard of hearing, language, understanding) o Altered mental status (not alert and oriented x 3) o Evidence of alcohol or drug intoxication o Distracted by circumstances or injuries to self or others (ie, any other injury capable of producing significant pain in this patient) Any abnormal neurological function in extremities (check all 4 extremities): o Numbness or tingling (paresthesia) o Motor strength not full and symmetrical o Sensation not intact and symmetrical Midline tenderness on palpation: o Explain to the patient the actions that you are going to take, ask the patient to immediately report any pain, and to answer questions with a \"yes\" or \"no\" rather than shaking the head o With the patient 's spine supported to limit movement, begin palpation at the base of the skull at the midline of the spine o Palpate the vertebrae individually from the base of the skull to the bottom of the sacrum o On palpation of each vertebral body, look for evidence of pain and ask the patient if they are experiencing pain; if evidence of pain along the spinal column is encountered, utilize spinal motion restriction Pain with movement of neck (cervical flexion, extension and rotation). o If the capable patient is found to be pain free, ask the patient to turn their head first to one side (so that the chin is pointing toward the shoulder on the same side as the head is rotating) then, if pain free, to the other. If there is evidence of pain, utilize spinal motion restriction o With the head rotated back to its normal position, ask the patient to flex and extend their neck. If there is evidence of pain, utilize spinal motion restriction. Do not assist patient in attempts to rotate neckEMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS E A P/ /E A P/ /6.0 Spinal Trauma and Assessment Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20234.6 Spinal motion restriction is defined as application of a cervical collar and maintenance of the spine in neutral alignment. Determination that immobilization devices should be used should be made by the highest level EMS practitioner. All steps of spinal assessment algorithm below must be documented in the PCR. If patient requires Spinal Motion Restriction: Apply a rigid cervical collar. Self-extrication by patient is allowable if patient is capable. Allow ambulatory patients to sit on stretcher and then lie flat. Position backboarded patient on stretcher then remove backboard by using log roll or lift - and-slide technique. Situations or treatment priorities may require patient to remain on rigid vacuum mattress or backboard, including the multi -trauma patient, combative patient, elevated intracranial pressure ( Traumatic Brain Injury - Adult & Pediatric 4.10 ), or rapid transport of unstable patient. Head immobilization may be appropriate for patients unable to control their own movements. With the patient lying flat, secure patient firmly with all stretcher straps and leave the cervical collar in place. Instruct the patient to avoid moving head or neck as much as possible. Elevate stretcher back only if necessary for patient compliance, respiratory function, or other significant treatment priority. If patient poorly tolerates collar (e.g., due to anxiety, shortness of breath, torticollis), replace with towel roll and/or padding. Patients with nausea or vomiting may be placed in a lateral recumbent position. Maintain neutral head position with manual stabilization, padding/pillows, and/or the patient's arm. (Nausea/Vomiting - 2.14). Pediatric Patients Requiring a Child Safety Seat For pediatric patients requiring spinal motion restriction, transport in a child safety seat (Pediatric Transportation - 8.13): Apply padding and cervical collar as tolerated to minimize the motion of the child 's spine. Rolled towels may be used for very young children or those who do not tolerate a collar. Patient may remain in own safety seat after motor vehicle crash if it has a self -contained harness with a high back and two belt paths and is undamaged. If all criteria are not met, use ambulance 's safety seat. If the patient requires significant care (e.g. airway management) that cannot be adequately performed in a car seat, remove the patient and secure him/her directly to the stretcher. E A P/ /E A P/ /EMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS Long backboards do not have a role for patients being transported between facilities. If the sending facility has the patient on a long backboard or is asking EMS to use a long backboard for transport, EMS providers should discuss not using a long backboard with the sending facility physician before transporting a patient. If a long backboard is used, it should be padded to minimize patient discomfort. Patients with only penetrating trauma do not require spinal motion restriction. Caution should be exercised in older patients (e.g., 65 years or older) and in very young patients (e.g., less than 3 years of age), as spinal assessment may be less sensitive in discerning spinal fractures in these populations. High risk mechanisms include: Motor vehicle crash >60 mph, rollover, ejection. Simple low -speed, rear -end MVC can usually be excluded. (Simple low -speed collision does not include: Being pushed into oncoming traffic, being hit by a bus or large truck, rollover, or being hit by a high -speed vehicle.) Falls > 3 feet/5 stairs. Patients > 65 years or with a high -risk history such as osteoporosis should be given extra consideration, including falls from standing.

Providers' reactions can impact patient recovery and strengthen or hinder prosecution of the perpetrator. Non -judgmental and compassionate care and thorough documentation and preservation of evidence are essential. Strangulation is defined as asphyxiation caused by closure of blood vessels and or air passageways of the neck due to external pressure. External pressure can be manual via a body part such as hands, arms, knees, etc., or can be by an object such as a belt, rope, etc. Patients are at risk of delayed death due to internal swelling, anoxia, hematoma or structural damage that cannot be identified externally. Patients should be encouraged to seek medical care; if transported, communicate reported strangulation attempt to hospital staff.

Intubation should be approached with extreme caution as it has been associated with worse outcomes when performed in the out -of-hospital environment for patients with traumatic brain injury. A single non-spurious O 2 sat of < 90% is independently associated with a doubling of mortality. Hyperventilation is independently associated with at least a doubling of mortality and some studies have shown that even moderate hyperventilation can increate the risk of dying by six times. A single episode of SBP < 90 mmHg is independently associated with at least a doubling of mortality. Repeated episodes of hypotension can increase the risk of dying by as much as eight times. Implementation of this practice bundle has been shown to double the survival rate of severely head injured patients and triple the rate of survival for intubated patients.4.10 PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS -- PEDIATRICPPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS -- ADULT Consider supraglottic airway (SGA) or intubation if GCS is < 8 and unable to maintain airway with BVM.

BVM ventilation is an acceptable method of airway management if pulse oximetry can be maintained above 94%. Rapid transport destination determination and notification of the receiving facility in the event of a \"Trauma Alert \" are critical for severely -injured patients. Geriatric patients should be evaluated with a high index of suspicion, as age related factors may reduce their ability to sense pain, and their ability to compensate effectively in traumatic injury. Mechanism is the most reliable indicator of serious injury in many settings. TXA in multi -system trauma must be given within 3 hours of injury. Rapid bolus administration of TXA can cause hypotension, so care should be taken in administration.4.12 IF ABNORMAL FINDINGS ABOVE Obtain IV/IO access.

As such, the provider must rely on thorough assessment techniques and consider each of the following: Airway Patency: Assess for airway obstruction or risk of impending obstruction due to facial injuries, mass, foreign body, swelling, etc. Assess for presence/absence of gag reflex. Ventilatory Status: Assess for adequate respiratory effort and impending fatigue/failure/apnea. Assess for accessory m uscle use, tripod positioning, the ability of the patient to speak in full sentences. If available, assess waveform capnography. Oxygenation: Any oxygen saturation <90% represents relatively severe hypoxia and should be considered an important warning sign. In addition to oxygen saturation, assess for cyanosis. Airway Anatomy: Before attempting airway maneuvers or endotracheal intubation, especially with the use of RSI, assess patient anatomy to predict the probability of success and the need for backup device or technique. First, assess for difficulty of mask seal. Patients with facial hair, facial fractures, obesity, extremes of age, and pathologically stiff lungs (COPD, acute respiratory distress syndrome, etc.) may require special mask techniques or alternatives. Next assess for difficulty of intubation. Patients with a short neck, the inability to open their mouth at least three finger widths (or other oral issues such as a large tongue or high arched palate), less than three finger -widths of thyromental distance (or a receding jaw), reduced atlanto -occipital movement (such as in suspected c -spine injury), obesity or evidence of obstruction (such as drooling or stridor) may be difficult to intubate. DEVISE A PLAN 1. Each patient will present unique challenges to airway management. Therefore, before any intervention is attempted, the provider should contemplate a plan of action that addresses the needs of the patient, and anticipates complications and how to manage them. 2. Airway management is a continuum of interventions, not an \"all or none \" treatment. Frequently patients may only need airway positioning or a nasal or oral airway to achieve adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Others will require more invasive procedures. The provider should choose the least invasive method that can be employed to achieve adequate ventilation and oxygenation. 3. Continually reassess the efficacy of the plan and change the plan of action as the patient 's needs dictate. 4. In children, a graded approach to airway management is recommended. Basic airway maneuvers and basic adjuncts followed by bag -valve -mask (BVM) ventilation are usually effective. Airway Management Procedure Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20235.0BASIC SKILLS Mastery of basic airway skills is paramount to the successful management of a patient with respiratory compromise. Ensure a patent airway with the use of: Chin-lift/jaw -thrust Nasal airway Oral airway Suction Removal of foreign body. BVM : Provide ventilation with a bag -valve -mask. Using a PEEP valve set at 5 - 15 cmH 2O is recommended. Proper use of the BVM includes appropriate mask selection and head positioning so sternal notch and ear are at the same level, to ensure a good seal. Elevate the stretcher to at least 30\u00ba when appropriate. If possible, utilization of the BVM is best accomplished with two people: one person uses both hands to seal the mask and position the airway, while the other person provides ventilation, until chest rise. If the patient has some respiratory effort; synchronize ventilations with the patient 's own inhalation effort. Utilize disposable bacteriostatic filter. ADVANCED AIRWAY SKILLS Only after basic procedures are deemed inappropriate or have proven to be inadequate should more advanced methods be used. Procedures documenting the use of each device/technique listed below are found elsewhere in this manual. NIV: Non-invasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or high -flow nasal cannula has been shown to be effective in eliminating the need for intubation and in decreasing mortality in properly -selected patients with acute respiratory distress. ETT: The endotracheal tube is considered the optimal method of securing the airway in patients with significant respiratory distress and/or airway compromise. However, the incidence of complications is unacceptably high when intubation is performed by inexperienced providers or monitoring of tube placement is inadequate. The optimal method for managing an airway will, therefore, vary based on provider experience, emergency medical services (EMS) or healthcare system characteristics, and the patient 's condition. Use capnography continuously for placement and CO2 monitoring. Use video laryngoscopy, if available and trained. ETT Introducer - \"Bougie \": All providers who attempt ETT placement should become intimately familiar with the use of a Bougie. It is the device used most often by anesthesiologists and emergency physicians for helping guide placement when a difficult airway is encountered. Bougie must be available for all intubations performed. SALAD (Suction Assisted Laryngoscopy and Airway Decontamination) Procedure: Utilize for difficult airway with liquid contaminants present in adult. Supraglottic Airways: Utilization of supraglottic airways is an acceptable alternative to endotracheal intubation as both a primary device or a back -up device when previous attempt(s) at ETT placement have failed. Each device has its own set of advantages/disadvantages and requires a unique insertion technique. Providers should have access to, and intimate knowledge of, at least one supraglottic airway. Cricothyrotomy: This procedure is indicated only when all other measures fail or you are presented with a situation in which intubation is contraindicated or in which you cannot intubate or otherwise ventilate the patient. Examples include m assive facial trauma or upper airway obstruction due to edema, mass or foreign body.Airway Management Procedure Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20235.2 PROCEDURES (continued) 4. Set Breaths per Minute (BPM) control to rate of 8 - 15 per minute. 5. Check alarm by occluding the patient valve assembly outlet. The audible pressure limit alarm should sound as the ventilator cycles through the delivery phase. 6. Assess lung compliance and chest rise with a bag valve device. Tidal volume may be adjusted lower if poor lung compliance is found. 7. Attach the patient valve assembly to the airway device or mask used on the patient. 8. Assess ventilation. Listen for bilateral lung sounds. Observe for proper chest rise. Chest rise should be symmetrical and patient condition should improve. 9. Count the number of complete ventilator cycles for a full minute. The number should be the same as the setting (+/ - 1). 10. Assess and manage the airway as you normally would for any patient with controlled ventilation. 11. If spontaneous breathing begins, it may be desirable to turn the BPM down as long as patient's spontaneous rate is 10 - 12 per minute. 12. Check oxygen cylinder pressure level frequently. This device will deplete a \"D\" cylinder rapidly. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Due to COPD, chest rise may not appear full Do not increase tidal volume (TV) past upper TV limit. If lung sounds are absent or on one side only: rule out airway obstruction, improper tube placement, or pneumothorax, and check tidal volume ml/bpm settings. If chest expansion is not adequate, the rescuer should slowly increase tidal volume until chest expansion is adequate, or the uppermost limit (for the patient's ideal weight) is reached. If chest appears to over expand, decrease tidal volume.ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS A P/A P/2013INDICATIONS Spontaneously breathing patient in severe respiratory distress due to Asthma/COPD, Congestive Heart Failure / Pulmonary Edema, Pneumonia or Drowning.

PPARAMEDIC MEDICAL DIRECTION ORDERS - ADULT ONLY (CONTACT MEDICAL DIRECTION FOR PEDIATRIC DOSING)5.4 2023PINDICATIONS To facilitate routine placement of endotracheal tube. Unable to fully visualize vocal cords during an intubation attempt. LIMITATIONS Adult Bougies should not be used on less than 6.0 ETT. PROCEDURE 1. Endotracheal tube may be preloaded on bougie if provider is familiar with technique being used. Always lubricate cuff of endotracheal tube with water - based lubricant. 2. Using techniques described in the Orotracheal Intubation - 5.8 attempt to visualize the vocal cords. Always use all techniques necessary to optimize laryngeal view before trying to pass the bougie. 3. If the vocal cords are partially visualized, pass the bougie through the cords while attempting to feel signs of tracheal placement (see below). Gently advance bougie until holdup is felt. If the bougie does not stop advancing the bougie is likely in the esophagus. 4. If the vocal cords are not visualized, pass the bougie behind the epiglottis, guiding the tip of the bougie anteriorly toward the trachea and assess for signs of tracheal placement (see below). Do not attempt to pass the bougie if the epiglottis is not visualized. Gently advance bougie until holdup is felt. If the bougie does not stop advancing the bougie is likely in the esophagus. 5. With laryngoscope still in place, advance preloaded tube off bougie or have assistant load the tube onto the bougie and advance it to the lip line. 6. Advance the ETT over the Bougie, rotating the ETT about 1/4 turn counterclockwise so that the bevel is oriented vertically as the ETT passes through the vocal cords. This maneuver allows the bevel to gently spread the arytenoids with a minimum of force, thus avoiding injury. If resistance is felt, withdraw the ETT, rotating it in a slightly more counterclockwise direction, and advance the tube again. Advance the tube to a lip -line of 24 cm in an adult male, and 22 cm in an adult female or until cuff is seen passing through cords. 7. Holding the ETT firmly in place, have an assistant remove the Bougie. 8. Remove the laryngoscope. 9. Inflate the cuff with 5 - 10 ml of air. 10. Follow the procedures outlined in Orotracheal Intubation - 5.8 to confirm placement, secure the ETT, monitor and document placement of the ETT. SIGNS OF TRACHEAL PLACEMENT The Bougie is felt to \"hold up \" as the airway narrows and is unable to be advanced further. This is the most reliable sign of proper Bougie placement. If the Bougie enters the esophagus, it will continue to advance without resistance. It may be possible to feel the tactile sensation of \"clicking \" as the Bougie tip is advanced downward over the rigid cartilaginous tracheal rings. The Bougie can be felt to rotate as it enters a mainstem bronchus. Usually it is a clockwise rotation as the Bougie enters the right mainstem bronchus, but occasionally it will rotate counterclockwise if the Bougie enters the left mainstem bronchus. If the patient is not paralyzed, he/she may cough.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20235.5INDICATIONS Sudden onset of respiratory distress often with coughing, wheezing, gagging or stridor due to a foreign -body obstruction of the upper airway. PROCEDURE Routine Patient Care: oAssess the degree of foreign body obstruction oDo not interfere with a mild obstruction allowing the patient to clear their airway by coughing oIn severe foreign -body obstructions, the patient may not be able to make a sound; the victim may clutch his/her neck in the universal choking sign For an infant - Deliver 5 back blows followed by 5 chest thrusts repeatedly until the object is expelled or the victim becomes unresponsive. For a child - Perform subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver) until the object is expelled or the victim becomes unresponsive. For adults - A combination of maneuvers may be required: oFirst, subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver) should be used in rapid sequence until the obstruction is relieved oIf abdominal thrusts are ineffective, chest thrusts should be used (chest thrusts should be used primarily in morbidly obese patients and in patients who are in the late stages of pregnancy) If the victim becomes unresponsive, begin CPR immediately but look in the mouth before administering any ventilations. If a foreign -body is visible, remove. Do not perform blind finger sweeps in the mouth and posterior pharynx. This may push the object farther into the airway.EMT/ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS If basic foreign body airway maneuvers fail, consider any of the following: oIn unresponsive patients, visualize the posterior pharynx with a laryngoscope to potentially identify and remove the foreign-body using Magill forceps oIf obstruction is secondary to trauma or edema, or if uncontrollable bleeding into the airway causes life-threatening ventilation impairment, perform endotracheal intubation (see Orotracheal Intubation Procedure - 5.8) oConsider forced right mainstem intubation (with pullback) to allow for ventilation of left lung in the extreme event of lower tracheal foreign body obstruction and inability to ventilate oIf unable to intubate and the patient cannot be adequately ventilated by other means, perform cricothyrotomy (see Percutaneous Cricothyrotomy Procedure - 5.9, or Surgical Cricothyrotomy - 5.12)Foreign -Body Obstruction Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20235.6 PEARLS If air exchange is adequate with a partial airway obstruction, do not interfere; instead, encourage the patient to cough up the obstruction. Continue to monitor the patient for adequacy of air exchange. If air exchange becomes inadequate, continue with the protocol.EA/EA/ PINDICATIONS Impending respiratory failure with intact gag reflex, or jaw is clenched and unable to be opened in spontaneously breathing patient. CONTRAINDICATIONS INCLUDE: Apnea. Nasal obstruction. Suspected basilar skull fracture. Severe facial trauma or suspected facial fractures. Patient fits on a pediatric length -based resuscitation tape. PROCEDURE 1. Pre -medicate such as neo -synephrine, if available. 2. Pre -oxygenate the patient. 3. Select the larger and less obstructed nostril and insert a lubricated nasal airway. 4. Lubricate the ETT with water -based lubricant. 5. Remove the nasal airway and gently insert the ETT with continuous waveform capnography monitoring, keeping the bevel toward the septum (a gentle rotation movement may be necessary at the turbinates). 6. Continue to advance the ETT while listening for maximum air movement and watching for capnography waveform. Consider use of BAAM device to aid in listening to airflow. 7. At the point of maximum air movement, indicating proximity to the level of the glottis, gently and evenly advance the tube through the glottic opening on inspiration. If resistance is encountered, the tube may have become lodged into the pyriform sinus and you may note tenting of the skin on either side of the thyroid cartilage. If this happens, slightly withdraw the ETT and rotate it toward the midline and attempt to advance tube again with the next inspiration. 8. Upon entering the trachea, the tube may cause the patient to cough, buck, strain, or gag. This is normal. Do not remove the ETT. Be prepared to control the cervical spine and be alert for vomiting. 9. Placement depth should be from the nares to the tip of the tube: approximately 28 cm in males and 26 cm in females. 10. Inflate cuff with 5 - 10 mL of air. 11. Confirm appropriate placement by waveform capnography, symmetrical chest -wall rise, auscultation of equal breath sounds over the chest, a lack of epigastric sounds with bagging. 12. Secure the ETT, consider applying a cervical -collar and securing patient to a long backboard (even for the medical patient) to protect the placement of the ETT.

Positioning goal of patient's ear canal level with the sternal notch. Use ramping of patients as necessary. Consider first pass Bougie/Flex Guide approach with predicted difficult airways. If a difficult airway with liquid contaminants is present in the adult; consider the SALAD (Suction Assisted Laryngoscopy and Airway Decontamination) procedure for oral decontamination using a wide bore suction catheter (such as DuCanto Catheter) as a tongue depressor/lifter followed by laryngoscope blade insertion. Insert Bougie through catheter to facilitate ETT placement as needed. 4. Open the patient 's airway. While holding the laryngoscope in the left hand, insert the blade into the right side of the patient 's mouth, sweeping the tongue to the left. Use video laryngoscopy, if available and trained. 5. Use the blade to lift the tongue and the epiglottis, either directly with the straight (Miller) blade, or indirectly with the curved (Macintosh) blade. 6. Once the glottic opening is visualized, insert the tube through the vocal cords and continue to visualize while passing the cuff through the cords. 7. Remove the laryngoscope and then the stylet from the ETT. 8.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20235.11 This protocol applies to commercially available supraglottic airway devices. These airways must be used as directed by the manufacturer 's guidelines. They may be used in all age groups for which the devices are designed. Providers must be trained on and competent with the airway device they will be using. Note: Double Lumen Devices (e.g., Combitube) are no longer approved. PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERSINDICATIONS Cardiac Arrest. RELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS Severe maxillofacial or oral trauma. For devices inserted into the esophagus: o The patient has known esophageal disease o The patient has ingested a caustic substance o The patient has burns involving the airway PROCEDURE Insertion procedure should follow manufacturer guidelines as each device is unique. Confirm appropriate placement by symmetrical chest -wall rise, auscultation of equal breath sounds over the chest and a lack of epigastric sounds with bag valve mask ventilation, and waveform capnography, if available. Secure the device. Document the time, provider, provider level and success for the procedure. Complete all applicable airway confirmation fields including chest rise, bilateral, equal breath sounds, absence of epigastric sounds and end -tidal CO 2 readings. Reassess placement frequently, especially after patient movement.ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS20132013INDICATIONS The following protocol is an effort to maintain awareness of a procedure that occurs rarely in the Vermont EMS system. Ultimately, this procedure should be practiced on a regular basis to maintain proficiency. PLEASE NOTE: This protocol describes a generally acceptable open cricothyrotomy and will differ from services that employ percutaneous kits. The inclusion of this protocol DOES NOT mandate that all providers use this exact procedural description. Providers should employ the procedure they are trained, practiced and most comfortable with. This protocol is one of multiple acceptable means to perform this procedure. Regardless of the procedure type, it is essential that Vermont paramedics are familiar with the available supplies and materials. The primary indication for surgical cricothyrotomy is failure to maintain the airway (including oxygenation, ventilation, and protection) through other less invasive means in a patient 8 years or older with palpable landmarks. In the Vermont EMS experience, this has occurred predominantly in trauma cases with disruption of the face and normal airway anatomy and in choking patients. Even in some dramatic facial injuries, the airway may be adequately managed by sitting the patient up and leaning forward, as long as the other injuries allow. MATERIALS/EQUIPMENT 1. Cuffed tracheostomy tube or 6.0 - 7.0 ETT 2. Tracheal hook or bougie 3. Trousseau dilator (if available) 4. Syringe to inflate cuff 5. Scalpel 6. Swabs/skin prep 7.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20235.13 INDICATIONS An adult or pediatric patient with an established tracheostomy in respiratory distress or failure. PROCEDURE 1. Consult with the patient 's caregivers for assistance. 2. Assess tracheostomy tube. Look for possible causes of distress (DOPES) which may be easily correctable, such as a detached oxygen source. 3. If the patient 's breathing is adequate but exhibits continued signs of respiratory distress, administer high -flow oxygen via non -rebreather mask or blow -by, as tolerated, over the tracheostomy. 4. If patient 's breathing is inadequate, assist ventilations using bag -valve -mask device with high -flow oxygen. 5. If on a ventilator, remove the patient from the ventilator prior to using bag valve mask device as there may be a problem with the ventilator or oxygen source. 6. Suction if unable to ventilate via tracheostomy or if respiratory distress continues. 7. Use no more than 100 mmHg suction pressure. 8. If the tracheostomy tube has a cannula, remove it prior to suctioning. 9. Determine proper suction catheter length by measuring the obturator. 10. If the obturator is unavailable, insert the suction catheter approximately 2 - 3 inches into the tracheostomy tube. Do not use force! 11. 2 - 3 mL saline flush may be used to help loosen secretions. 12. If the patient remains in severe distress, continue ventilation attempts using bag valve mask with high -flow oxygen via the tracheostomy. Consider underlying reasons for respiratory distress and refer to the appropriate protocol for intervention. PPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERSHigh Flow Nasal Cannula Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20235.14 BACKGROUND High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) is a mode of noninvasive respiratory support that delivers high flows of heated and humidified blended air and oxygen through an unsealed nasal interface. The use of HFNC is associated with improved physiological outcomes including respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), work of breathing, and oxygenation (Sp02). INDICATIONS Severe respiratory distress PLUS persistent Sp02 < 92% on maximum low -flow NC in patient who can maintain their airway (alert and able to swallow). HFNC is ideally suited for hypoxic respiratory distress as might be seen in bronchiolitis in infants and children. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patient needing advanced respiratory support (CPAP, BiPAP or Intubation). Properly sized equipment unavailable or poor fit. Recent GI, airway, or tracheal surgery. Tracheotomy. Significant neck or facial trauma. Foreign body aspiration. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Primary dx of pneumonia, asthma, or croup. Born prematurely < 34 weeks (if < 6 months). Complex medical history, cardiac or lung disease. Infants < 8 weeks old. PROCEDURE Set up equipment (refer to Airvo 2 & Optiflow Junior 2 user manual or quick guide). Choose appropriately sized nasal cannula using recommended nare occlusion of 50%. Suction nares just prior to initiation of treatment. Set appropriate mode (pediatric or adult) and temperature (34C pedi or 37C adult). Start HFNC at 2 L/kg/min for infants up to 12 kg. Start flow rates for those over 12 kg using weight -based flow rates as per table below. Start FiO2 at 30 -40% and titrate to Sp02 92% of 92 Consider or WEIGHT BASED FLOW RATEPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERSHigh Flow Nasal Cannula Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20235.14 TRANSPORT TEAM CONFIGURATION In the hospital setting, re -assess patient after 60 minutes for response to treatment and stability based on improvement in RR, HR, work of breathing, and level of alertness. Consider transport team configuration as below. For HFNC consider 2 providers with patient. See Interfacility Transport Protocol 7.0. Paramedic - Patient is stable and meets all three of the following criteria: o Flow at 2 L/kg/min or as per Weight Based Flow Chart o FiO2 40% o Child < 5 kg has appropriate restraint and warning system Critical Care Transport Team - Patient has continued respiratory distress or hypoxia or requires increased flow or 02 settings.

For patients with continued symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome, perform repeat ECGs during transport to evaluate for evolving STEMI. 10. Copies of 12 -lead ECG labeled with the patient 's name and date of birth should be left with the receiving hospital and incorporated into the patient 's SIREN record.ECG interpretation in the prehospital environment can be performed only by Paramedics. 12 -lead ECG acquisition and transmission may be performed by EMTs, AEMTs or Paramedics. EMRs, EMTs and AEMTs may not apply 3/4 lead ECG to patient except under direct observation/request of an on -scene Paramedic. Agencies are strongly encouraged to develop the capability to transmit ECGs to receiving hospitals. Mid Clavicle LineThis protocol is designed to provide basic guidance to EMS crews surrounding the screening, precautions, and post -call safety procedures related to certain viral and bacterial illnesses that are highly contagious and carry significant likelihood of morbidity and mortality. This document is expected to be a living document, with revisions implemented as new diseases become the focus of infection prevention and more is learned about the appropriate precautions. ROLE OF E911 DISPATCH Under certain circumstances, Vermont 911 dispatchers may receive directives to screen callers with emergencies requiring EMS for symptoms and history questions which suggest someone may present with a pandemic -based or other high -risk infectious disease. Whenever possible, dispatchers should relay this information to responding public safety agencies so further precautions can be taken. EMS practitioners are responsible for performing their own clinical assessments if they self -identify a situation where further precautions may need to be taken. Guidance on such screenings can be found in the table below.High Consequence Pathogen Maintenance & Considerations Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

The bone marrow space serves as a \"noncollapsible vein \" and provides access to the general circulation for the administration of fluids and resuscitation drugs. This protocol applies to all appropriate IO insertion sites. INDICATION Drug or fluid resuscitation of a patient in profound shock or other critical illness and in need of immediate life -saving intervention and unable to rapidly obtain peripheral IV access. If IV access cannot be obtained, IO access may be used as a vascular device in cardiac arrest. In cardiac arrest: o Proximal humeral or distal femur is preferred over anterior tibial in adults o Distal femur is preferred over anterior tibial in pediatric patients CONTRAINDICATIONS Placement in or distal to a fractured bone. Placement at an infected site. Placement at site where IO was already attempted. COMPLICATIONS Infusion rate may not be adequate for resuscitation of ongoing hemorrhage or severe shock, extravasation of fluid, fat embolism, and osteomyelitis (rare). EQUIPMENT 15 - 19 gauge bone marrow needle or FDA -approved commercial intraosseous infusion device. Gloves and povidone -iodine, chlorhexidine solution or alcohol wipes. Primed IV tubing, IV stopcock. 10 mL syringe with 0.9% NaCl. Pressure pump/bag or 60 mL syringe for volume infusion or slow push.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 2023IO access is not indicated simply for inability to start an IV, but rather is reserved for patients with profound shock or other critical illness.6.2 A/PA/PA/PA/PPROCEDURE When using an FDA -approved commercial IO device, follow manufacturer 's instructions. 1. Identify the bony landmarks as appropriate for device. 2. Choose correct needle size based on size of patient, generally: 45 mm proximal humerus or distal ( pediatric/ small patient) 15 mm anterior tibial skin and bone ( pediatric /thin). Do not use the proximal humeral site in pediatric patients. 3. Prep the site. Scrub site with alcohol wipe or other cleaning solution and allow to dry. 4. Insert IO needle. Follow manufacturer 's instructions for preferred sites. 5. Needle is appropriately placed if the following are present: If appropriate, aspiration with syringe yields blood with marrow particulate matter. Infusion of saline does not result in infiltration at the site. Needle stands without support. 6. Attach IV tubing, with or without stopcock. 7. Paramedic only : Prior to IO syringe bolus (flush) or continuous infusion in alert patients: Ensure that the patient has no allergies or sensitivity to lidocaine. SLOWLY administer lidocaine 2% (preservative free) through the IO device catheter. Allow 2 - 5 minutes for anesthetic effects, if possible: o Adult: 20 - 50 mg (1 - 2.5 mL) 2% lidocaine o Pediatric: 0.5 mg/kg 2% lidocaine (maximum 50 mg) 8. Flush with 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl rapid bolus x 3 prior to use: Recommend use of a stop cock inline with syringe for bolus infusions. Use a for continuous 0.9% NaCl infusions. 9. Stabilize needle: Consider utilizing a commercially available stabilization device as recommended by the manufacturer, OR Stabilize needle on both sides with sterile gauze and secure with tape (avoid tension on needle). 10. Apply ID bracelet to indicate patient has had an IO placed or attempted.Intraosseous Access Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

Restraining must be performed in a humane manner and used only as a last resort. PROCEDURE 1. Scene and EMS safety, first. 2. Request law enforcement assistance and mental health services, as necessary. 3. When appropriate, attempt less restrictive means of managing the patient, including de -escalation techniques. 4. Ensure that there are sufficient personnel available to physically restrain the patient safely. 5. Restrain the patient in a lateral or supine position. No devices such as backboards, splints, or other devices may be placed on top of the patient. Never hog-tie a patient. In order to gain control, the patient may need to be in a prone position, but must be moved to supine or lateral position as soon as possible. 6. The patient must be under constant observation by the EMS crew at all times. This includes direct visualization of the patient as well as cardiac, pulse oximetry, and waveform capnography monitoring, if available. 7. The extremities that are restrained must have a circulation check at least every 15 minutes. The first of these checks should occur as soon after placement of the restraints as possible. 8. Documentation in the PCR should include the reason for the use of restraints, the type of restraints used, the time restraints were placed, circulation checks, and any injuries resulting from restraints. 9. If a patient is restrained by law enforcement personnel with handcuffs or other devices EMS personnel cannot remove, a law enforcement officer should accompany the patient to the hospital in the transporting ambulance. If this is not feasible, the officer MUST follow directly behind the transporting ambulance to the receiving hospital. 10. Once applied, restraint should not be removed in the field unless medically necessary to provide care. 6.4 PPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS PROCEDURE 1. If physical restraints are used and patient continues to be violent/agitated, pharmacological sedation may be administered as soon as possible to assist in control of patient and to help prevent patient from harming themselves.Restraints Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

Continuously monitor ECG, vitals, oxygen saturation and EtCO 2. Once sedated & secured to stretcher, establish IV access and give 1000 mL 0.9% NS IV bolus. EMS transport is required for any patient that receives sedation or chemical restraint. After chemical restraint, re -evaluate whether the patient continues to meet criteria for physical restraint and remove if they are no longer necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, providers or both, taking into account transport times, the depth of sedation and the need to transfer the patient at destination. For acute dystonic reaction to droperidol/haloperidol: o Diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg IV or 50 mg IM If cardiac arrest occurs, consider additional fluid boluses and sodium bicarbonate early ( Cardiac Arrest - 3.2A). Treat hyperthermia ( Hyperthermia (Environmental) - Adult & Pediatric 2.12 ).PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS - ADULT P PEARLS: Causes of combativeness may be due to comorbid medical conditions or due to hypoxia, hypoglycemia, drug and/or alcohol intoxication, drug overdose, brain trauma or delirium with agitated behavior. De-escalation techniques may be effective and should be attempted when possible. Delerium with agitated behavior, a presentation marked by both disorientation and severe agitation or combativeness, is associated with hyperthermia, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiac arrest. In these severely impaired patients, rapid pharmacologic management/sedation may prevent these adverse and life - threatening conditions and maximize patient safety.PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS - PEDIATRIC 2013Restraints Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20236.4 P Haloperidol can lower the seizure threshold and should be used with caution. Medications should be administered cautiously in frail or debilitated patients; lower doses should be considered. Medical Direction is required for all sedation of adults with combative behavior. Every effort should be made to contact Medical Direction prior to medication administration. For emergent situations with high risk of injury to patient or EMS practitioners and if unable to contact Medical Direction prior to administration, notify Medical Direction as soon as feasible after medication administration. Pearls Droperidol offers rapid single drug therapy for control of both psychosis and agitation without causing respiratory depression often associated with other agents. It is an ideal agent for the agitated with alcohol or other CNS depressant ingestions. While droperidol generally works well as a single agent, if not providing adequate sedation, may add midazolam cautiously while monitoring for respiratory depression. Ketamine is reserved for the most severe patients exhibiting violent/combative behavior or delerium with agitation, often associated with meth or other stimulant drug ingestions.Management of a Pediatric Patient with Resistant or Aggressive Behavior (resisting necessary treatment/interventions): Contact Medical Direction to discuss treatment options. Management of a Pediatric Patient with Violent/Combative Behavior, or Delirium with Agitation (immediate danger to self/others, target goal is safe and compliant): Contact Medical Direction and consider (IM preferred route): o Ketamine 4 mg/kg IM rounded to nearest 25 mg, maximum dose 250mg (use 100 mg/mL concentration), may repeat half dose once in 5 - 10 minutes, OR o Midazolam 5 mg/mL concentration (IM or IN preferred): 0.2 mg/kg IM/IN (single maximum dose 8 mg), OR 0.1 mg/kg IV (single maximum dose 4 mg), OR o Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (single maximum dose 4 mg), OR o Diazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (single maximum dose 5 mg IV) o Contact Medical Direction if additional dosing is needed o If cardiac arrest occurs with suspected delirium with agitated behavior, consider early administration of: fluid bolus, sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride/gluconate 3.2P )EMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS 2013EMS should be activated and transport the patient following Taser application in the following circumstances: The probe is embedded in the eye, genitals, or bone. Seizure is witnessed after CEW application. There is excessive bleeding from probe site after probe removal. Cardiac arrest, complaints of chest pain, palpitations. Respiratory distress. Altered mental status. Pregnancy. Developmental or physical disability and unable to assess the above. INDICATIONS FOR REMOVAL Patient with uncomplicated conducted electrical weapon (Taser) probes embedded subcutaneously in non -vulnerable areas of skin. CONTRAINDICATIONS TO REMOVAL Patients with probe penetration in vulnerable areas of the body as mentioned below should be transported for further evaluation and probe removal. Genitalia, female breast, or skin above level of clavicles. Suspicion that probe might be embedded in bone, blood vessel, or other sensitive structure. Any condition listed above that requires transport to the emergency department. PROCEDURE 1. Ensure wires are disconnected from weapon. 2. Stabilize skin around probe using non -dominant hand. 3. Grasp probe by metal body using dominant hand. 4. Remove probe by pulling straight out in a single quick motion. 5. Insure that the probes and barbs are intact. 6. Removed probes should be handled and disposed of like contaminated sharps in a designated sharps container, unless requested as evidence by police. 7. Rinse wound with sterile water or saline and apply dressing. 8. If last tetanus immunization was greater than 5 years, advise the patient that they may need one. 9. Obtain a refusal of care for patients refusing transport.E A P/ /E A P/ /Taser (Conducted Electrical Weapon) Probe Removal and Assessment Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 2023State and local law enforcement may use a conducted electrical weapon (CEW), also referred to as a Taser. When used, the device discharges a wire that, at the distal end, contains an arrow -like barbed projectile that penetrates the suspect 's skin and embeds itself, allowing a 5 -second incapacitating electric shock. M edical literature does not support routine medical evaluation for an individual after a CEW application. In most circumstances probes can be removed by law enforcement without further EMS or other medical intervention. 6.5EMT STANDING ORDERSTourniquet & Hemostatic Agent Adult & Pediatric Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

Serious or life threatening hemorrhage and operational considerations prevent the use of standard hemorrhage control techniques. PROCEDURE Routine Patient Care. Attempt to control hemorrhage with direct pressure. If direct pressure ineffective or impractical and hemorrhage not controlled, apply tourniquet or hemostatic agent as indicated. Shock - 2.24A or Shock - 2.24P . Minimize scene time. Call for Paramedic intercept, if available. If not available, call for AEMT intercept. Trauma Triage and Transport Decision - 4.9. Apply tourniquet for wound amenable to tourniquet placement (e.g., extremity injury). Use a commercially -produced, windlass, pneumatic, or ratcheting device, which has been demonstrated to occlude arterial flow and avoid narrow, elastic, or bungee -type devices. Utilize improvised tourniquets only if no commercial device is available. Place tourniquet 2 - 3\" proximal to wound. o Tighten per manufacturer instructions until hemorrhage stops. o Secure tourniquet per manufacturer instructions. o Note time of tourniquet application and communicate this to receiving providers. o Dress wounds. o Do not release a properly -applied tourniquet until the patient reaches definitive care. o If delayed or prolonged transport and tourniquet application time 5 hours contact Medical Direction . o Consider application of a second tourniquet just proximal to the first for failure to control bleeding. o Apply a junctional tourniquet where indicated. Follow manufacturer 's instructions. Apply a topical hemostatic bandage, in combination with direct pressure, for wounds in anatomical areas where tourniquets cannot be applied and sustained direct pressure alone is ineffective or impractical. (Junctional/torso injury or proximal extremity location where tourniquet application is not practical.) o Only utilize a topical hemostatic bandage in a gauze format that supports wound packing.

(Not for prophylactic IV access.) CONTRAINDICATIONS Suspected infection at skin site. PROCEDURE Determine the type of catheter present: PICC, Broviac, Hickman, Groshong, Mediport, etc. Procedure For Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (Cook, Neo -PICC, Etc.) And Tunneled Catheter (Broviac, Hickman, Groshong, Etc.) 1. Prepare equipment: 10 mL syringe (empty). 10 mL syringe 0.9% NaCl. Sterile gloves (if available). 2. If more than one lumen is available (PICCs and Boviacs can have one, two, or three lumens), select the largest lumen available. 3. Vigorously prep the cap of the lumen with chlorhexidine. 4. Unclamp the catheter lumen and using a 10 mL syringe, (after unclamping the lumen) aspirate 3 - 5 mL of blood with the syringe and discard. If unable to aspirate blood, re -clamp the lumen and attempt to use another lumen (if present). If clots are present, contact Medical Direction before proceeding. 5. Flush the lumen with 3 - 5 mL 0.9% NaCl using a 10 mL syringe. If catheter does not flush easily (note that a PICC line will generally flush more slowly and with greater resistance than a typical intravenous catheter), re -clamp the selected lumen and attempt to use another lumen (if present). 6. Attach IV administration set and observe for free flow of IV fluid. 7. Run fluid at rate of 10 mL/hour to prevent the central line from clotting.PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS - ADULT ONLY The maximum flow rates for a PICC line are 125 mL/hour for < 2.0 Fr sized catheter and 250 mL/hour for > 2.0 Fr sized catheters. Avoid taking a blood pressure reading in the same arm as the PICC.Vascular Access Via Pre -Existing Central Catheter Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

Prepare all necessary equipment: Non-coring, right angle (Huber/Haberman) needle specific for implanted vascular access ports. 10 mL syringe (empty). Two 10 mL syringes 0.9% NaCl. Sterile gloves (if available). 2. Identify the access site; usually located in the chest. 3. Clean the access site with chlorhexidine solution. 4. Prime the non -coring needle tubing with saline. 5. Palpate the port to determine the size and center of the device. If not utilizing sterile gloves, re -clean the skin. 6. Secure the access point port firmly between two fingers and firmly insert the non-coring needle into the port, entering at a direct 90o angle. Attach a 10 mL syringe to haberman/huber needle. 7. Aspirate 3 - 5 mL of blood with the syringe. If unable to aspirate blood, re - clamp the catheter and do not attempt further use. If clots are present, contact Medical Direction before proceeding. 8. Flush the catheter with 3 - 5 mL 0.9% NaCl using a 10 mL syringe. If catheter does not flush easily, do not attempt further use. 9. Attach IV administration set and observe for free flow of IV fluid. 10. If shock is not present, allow fluid to run at rate of KVO to prevent the central line from clotting. Only non -coring, right angle needles specific for implanted ports are to be used for vascular access devices that are implanted in the patient. These are generally not carried by EMS units but may be provided by the patient. Priming the tubing of the non -coring needle is essential to prevent air embolism. In case of cardiac arrest, implanted ports may be accessed with a standard needle, if a non - coring needle is unavailable.PVascular Access Via Pre -Existing Central Catheter Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

Altered mental status. Traumatic brain injury. Diabetic ketoacidosis. Circulatory shock. Sepsis. Cyanide and/or carbon monoxide poisoning. Administration of sedative medication. ADVANCED AIRWAY DEVICES Confirm and document placement of advanced airway devices ( Airway Management Procedure - 5.0,and Airway Management Protocol 5.1A , or Airway Management Protocol - 5.1P). o Confirm continued placement of advanced airway devices after every patient move and at transfer of care Monitor CPR quality and for signs of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). High-quality chest compressions are achieved when the ETCO 2 is at least 20 mmHg. If ETCO 2 abruptly increases, it is reasonable to consider that this as an indicator of ROSC. Assist with termination of resuscitation efforts when: o ETCO 2 is < 20 mmHg despite adjusting the quality of chest compressions o ETCO 2 < 10 mmHg after 20 minutes of effective CPR is a predictor of mortality o Resuscitation Initiation & Termination - 8.17 PROCEDURE 1. Attach the sensor to endotracheal tube, supraglottic airway, BVM or apply cannula with ETCO 2 mouth scoop or bi -cannula. 2. Assess ETCO 2 numeric levels and waveform: Normal ETCO 2 range 35 - 45 mmHg. Elevated ETCO 2 may indicate hypoventilation/CO 2 retention. Low ETCO 2 may indicate hyperventilation, low perfusion, pulmonary embolus, sepsis. 3. With abnormal ETCO 2 levels consider adjusting rate and depth of ventilations. Any abrupt loss of ETCO2 detection or loss of continuous waveform may indicate a catastrophic failure of the airway, apnea, drug overdose, deep sedation and/or cardiac arrest warranting assessment of the airway, breathing, circulation, and/ or airway device. PEARLS Colorimetric CO 2 detectors are not an approved alternative to quantitative waveform capnography. Airway device placement confirmation and device monitoring should always be confirmed using quantitative waveform capnography. Numeric capnometry and capnography waveform morphology should be documented in the SIREN. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this section is to ensure interfacility transfers (IFT) comply with current VT law, licensure, and EMS protocols. It is intended to promote efficiency in IFT while maintaining patient safety. INTERFACILITY TRANSFER An IFT is defined as any EMS ambulance transport from one healthcare facility to another facility, including emergency departments (ED). In general, transports from a non -hospital healthcare facility and 911 calls to a hospital ED by EMS should not be regarded as interfacility transfers. Transferring Facility Responsibilities Certify benefits of transfer outweigh all expected risks. Ensure that patient has an accepting provider and bed assignment at destination facility. Transferring provider must ensure ongoing care will be sufficient and appropriate, and provide resources as necessary. Transferring provider remains responsible and available to serve as medical direction for transporting agency during transfer. Provide complete set of patient care orders for the transporting agency. In any case where the number of patients requiring transport exceeds the number of available EMS resources, the transferring institution shall decide the order in which patients are transported. Transporting Agency Responsibilities Assign personnel and resources that are most appropriate (consider training/experience, environmental factors, equipment needs). Decline transports when proper resources cannot or will not be provided and/or their level of training/experience is not compatible with patients acuity. Consult medical direction as necessary during transport. Seek education or information about therapies, transport equipment, or medications outside of normal formulary as necessary. Shared Responsibilities Assign the appropriate transport agency level for patient transport including sending hospital staff, if necessary (see following pages). Receive and relay a complete patient care report. Ensure every effort has been made to mitigate risk, including environmental factors. Medical Direction Responsibilities According to EMTALA, patient care during transport until arrival at the receiving facility is the responsibility of the transferring provider unless other arrangements are made with appropriate medical direction. In certain Air Medical Transport services or ground critical care units, the transport unit may function as an extension of a tertiary care center and operate under that facility 's medical direction and on - line medical direction. Interfacility Transfer Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20237.0 EMS personnel should follow their standard scope of practice, unless specific restrictions are included in the transferring facility provider 's written orders for transport. If at any time during transport a patient develops new signs/symptoms or has a change in status, EMS personnel shall refer to the appropriate VT EMS Protocol. If there is a conflict between VT EMS Protocols and the transferring facility provider 's written orders for transport, EMS should follow the written orders, as long as they are within the EMS practitioner 's scope of practice.Medical Direction Responsibilities (continued) In the prehospital setting, EMS operates under VT EMS protocols. During IFT, written transfer orders that are within the scope of the EMS practitioner 's or other healthcare provider 's level of licensure are also required to be authored by the transferring provider. The combination of protocols and transfer orders provide off -line medical direction. Transfer orders must be specific, appropriate to the patient being transferred, and reasonably anticipate potential complications enroute. Transfer orders may reference the use of VT EMS protocols where they are applicable. If patients develop new signs and/or symptoms during transport, beyond their initial transfer diagnosis, EMS personnel may treat the new signs and/or symptoms according to VT EMS protocols. If transfer orders and VT EMS protocols are in conflict, transfer orders take precedence assuming they are within the scope of the EMS practitioner 's or other healthcare provider 's level of licensure . The transferring provider should be available to review transport orders and provide medical direction during the transport. Transport Agency Levels EMT AEMT Paramedic Critical Care Paramedic (CCP) Critical Care Transport Team (CCT) At a minimum, 2 licensed EMS practitioners in the vehicle, of which 1 may be the driver, OR 1 licensed EMS practitioner providing patient care and a VT -certified VEFR driver. Interfacility transfers that are appropriate for EMT, AEMT, or Paramedic levels of care do not require additional levels of credentialing beyond training requirements defined in the VT EMS protocols. National Scope of Practice allows non -critical care Paramedics to provide IFT for appropriately selected patients. However, there are still several important procedures and medications vital to the safe interfacility transfer of critically ill or injured patients that are beyond the scope of practice for a Paramedic for which advanced critical care knowledge and skills will be required. The Vermont CCP endorsement provides an expanded scope of practice for numerous procedures and medications vital to the safe transport of the critically ill or injured patient. The CCP endorsement is outlined in the Appendix 6 . Procedures or medications in Appendix 6 labeled as \"W\" require an additional waiver from VT EMS. Some critically -ill patients will have a level of acuity and/or complexity that requires a more advanced Critical Care Transport team (CCT) \u2014either by air or ground. If that level of resource is not readily available, it is an acceptable practice to supplement the EMS crew with hospital staff that is qualified to provide the level of care the patient requires. EMS practitioners must decline to transport patients that have a level of acuity and/or medication regimen outside of their scope of practice, and work with the sending facility to acquire optimal staffing (such as sending nursing staff or other provider). The transferring physician/provider is responsible for determining the level of EMS practitioner and resources that are appropriate to meet the patient 's current and anticipated condition and needs. In the interfacility transfer environment, all patient care delivered must be within the scope of the EMS practitioner 's or other healthcare provider 's protocols and licensure. (EMS practitioners may need to educate sending/receiving facility staff about their respective scopes of practice and any limitations contained therein.)Interfacility Transfer Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20237.0 INTERFACILITY TRANSPORT TEAM SCOPES OF PRACTICEInterfacility Transfer Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

CRITICAL CARE TRANSPORT TEAM CONFIGURATION It is preferred that complex patients be managed by a Critical Care Transport (CCT) team. If a CCT is not available, consider the following alternatives. (Exercising any of the following alternative crew configurations does not expand the scope of practice of the assigned crew.) Preference : Critical Care Transport (CCT) Team. Alternative 1 : Critical Care Paramedic (CCP) and one of the following: CFRN/CTRN/CCRN/CEN (with appropriate adjunctive certifications e.g., ACLS, NRP etc.) FP-C, CCP -C (CCP) Respiratory Therapist Physician Assistant Nurse Practitioner Physician Alternative 2 : Paramedic and one of the following: CFRN/CTRN/CCRN/CEN (with appropriate adjunctive certifications e.g., ACLS, NRP etc.) FP-C, CCP -C (CCP) Respiratory Therapist Physician Assistant Nurse Practitioner Physician Alternative 3: As a measure of last resort, in cases where CCT providers are unavailable AND delay in transfer would have a significant negative impact on patient outcome, crew configurations not listed above may be utilized provided that: The sending facility makes reasonable effort to send appropriate personnel. An occurrence report is sent via email Vermont EMS and to the local District Medical Advisor (DMA) within 24 hours. All interventions are within the scope of practice of the assembled crew. Nothing shall preclude the transferring facility or transporting agency from sending additional providers not listed above if they feel it is appropriate for continuing patient care. Interfacility Transfer Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20237.0 PDefinitions Unstable Patient: A critically ill or injured patient who cannot be stabilized at the transporting facility, who is deteriorating or likely to deteriorate during transport. (From \"Guide for Interfacility Patient Transfer, \" NHTSA.) Potentially Unstable: A critically ill or injured patient who is currently stable (as defined below) but whose disease process will likely lead to instability or an acute change in condition enroute. Stable Patient: Hemodynamically stable patient with a secure airway and who is NOT in acute distress or likely to deteriorate during transport Resources: Could refer to personnel, equipment, medications or therapies. Sufficient & Appropriate: Transferring facilities are responsible for the coordination of ongoing care during transfer until the patient arrives at the destination facility. In certain Air Medical Transport services or ground critical care units, the transport unit may function as an extension of a tertiary care center and operate under that facility 's medical direction and on -line medical direction . Patient must continue receiving care that is commensurate with their condition and potential for deterioration throughout transfer within the limits of the system. This may mean providing additional transferring facility or transporting agency personnel, up to and including physicians if necessary.Interfacility Transfer Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20237.1 PURPOSE The purpose of this section is to provide a mechanism for paramedics to be permitted to monitor pre-existing infusions of heparin during interfacility transfers. POLICY a. Only those paramedics who have successfully completed a training program approved by Vermont EMS on heparin infusions will be allowed to administer and monitor heparin infusions during interfacility transports. b. Transporting ambulance service must be licensed at the paramedic level. c. Patients that are candidates for paramedic transport will have pre -existing intravenous heparin drips. Prehospital personnel will not initiate or bolus. Patient must not have any contraindications to use of heparin (below). INDICATIONS Acute myocardial infarction, angina, atrial fibrillation, arterial embolism. PROCEDURE a. The patient must have at least one functioning IV, preferably two (2). Patient must be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring. b. Medication pump and tubing supplied by the transporting ambulance agency. Pump may also be supplied by the hospital, provided the paramedic has been previously trained in the use of the hospital pump. c. The paramedic shall receive a report from the nurse/physician caring for the patient and continue the existing medication drip rate. d. If medication administration is interrupted by infiltration or disconnection, the paramedic may restart or reconnect the IV line. e. All medication drips will be in the form of an IV piggyback monitored by a mechanical pump familiar to the paramedic who has received training and is familiar with its use. f. In cases of pump malfunction that cannot be corrected, the medication drip will be discontinued and the receiving hospital notified. g. Paramedics are allowed to transport patients on heparin drips within the following parameters: i. Infusion fluid will be D5W or NS. Medication concentration will be 100 units/mL of IV fluid (25,000 units/250mL or 50,000 units/500 mL). The heparin drip will be prepared and supplied by the sending facility. Ensure sufficient volume is taken to complete the transfer. ii. Drip rates will remain constant during transport. No regulation of the rate will be performed except to turn off the infusion completely. iii. Drip rates will not exceed 18 units/kg/hr (based on adjusted body weight); max rate may be exceeded ONLY per Medical Direction orders. iv. Patient will be on continuous cardiac monitor. Monitor the patient for dysrhythmias, bleeding (petechial or bruising, bleeding from the gums, epistaxis, GI bleeding), hypotension (which can be a sign of internal bleeding), change in neurological exam concerning for intracranial hemorrhage (altered mental status, headache, numbness, weakness, seizure), or anaphylaxis.Interfacility Transport of Patients With IV Heparin by Paramedics Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20237.1 PROCEDURE (CONTINUED) v. Vital signs and neuro exam will be assessed every 10 minutes. vi. For bleeding, signs of intracranial hemorrhage (altered mental status, abnormal neuro exam), hypotension (shock) or anaphylaxis, contact Medical Direction to consider stopping the heparin infusion. Treat hypotension or bleeding as per standard protocols. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION a. Mechanism of Action: Heparin is an anticoagulant. Heparin inhibits the mechanisms that induce the clotting of blood and the formation of stable fibrin clots at various sites in the normal coagulation system. When heparin is combined with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor), thrombosis is blocked through inactivation of activated Factor X and inhibition of prothrombin's conversion to thrombin. This also prevents fibrin formation from fibrinogen during active thrombosis. Heparin has an almost immediate onset of action after IV administration, with an average plasma half -life of 1 to 2 hours. Anticoagulation is primarily due to neutralization of thrombin. In addition, clotting secondary to stasis and the extension of existing thrombi are also prevented. Heparin may interact with other drugs. In general, concurrent use of oral anticoagulants, salicylates, IIb/IIIa antagonists, or thrombolytics can increase the risk of bleeding or severe hemorrhage (internal or external). b. Complications: Bleeding complications occur in approximately 1.5 to 2% of patients on heparin including the potential for severe hemorrhage or intracranial bleeding. Patients may also have anaphylaxis. Patients must be monitored for hypotension which may be secondary to acute blood loss or anaphylaxis. If complications of bleeding, altered mental status, hypotension or anaphylaxis occur, contact Medical Direction and consider stopping the heparin infusion. Treat the patient with standard existing EMS protocols (control external bleeding, treat for shock). In severe cases a heparin reversal agent, protamine sulfate, may be given at the hospital, BUT IS NOT GIVEN IN THE PREHOSPITAL SETTING. c. Contraindications: Severe thrombocytopenia, active bleeding (except DIC), suspected intracranial bleeding.Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) PThis procedure is only to be used by paramedics who are trained and credentialed to perform RSI with oversight by local Medical Direction and agency participation in an RSI educational and CQI program approved by Vermont EMS. Either 2 RSI paramedics or 1 RSI paramedic and 1 RSI assistant must be present. INDICATION Immediate, severe airway compromise in the adult patient where respiratory arrest is imminent and other methods of airway management are ineffective. PROCEDURE: THE SEVEN P 'S PREPARATION \"SOAPME \": T minus 5 minutes. Suction set up. Oxygen: 100% non -rebreather mask, with bag -valve mask ready. Apply nasal cannula at 6 - 15 LPM in addition to non -rebreather or bag -valve mask Do not remove nasal cannula during intubation attempt(s). Assessment: Evaluate airway difficulty based on patient anatomy (e.g., short neck, obesity, decreased thyromental distance and Class III or IV oropharyngeal views on observation). Have fallback plan and equipment ready. Pharmacology: IV/Medications drawn. Monitor: Cardiac / O 2 saturation/ ETCO 2 . Equipment : ETT (check cuff) / Stylet / BVM / Laryngoscope / Blades / Suction / Bougie / Back -up devices. PREOXYGENATION: T minus 5 minutes. When possible, use a non -rebreather mask for at least 3 minutes to effect nitrogen washout and establish an adequate oxygen reserve. In emergent cases, administer 8 vital capacity bag -valve -mask breaths with 100% oxygen. Apply nasal cannula with oxygen regulator turned up to its fullest capacity (nasal cannula should remain in place until endotracheal tube is secured). PREMEDICATION: T minus 3 - 5 minutes. PEDIATRIC: Consider atropine 0.02 mg/kg IV/IO for pediatric patients with increased risk of bradycardia. No minimum dose. {SEDATE THEN} PARALYZE: T minus 45 seconds. Etomidate 0.3 40 mg, 0.2 Succinylcholine mg/kg IV/IO immediately after sedation. For IV/IO, OR o Vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO PASS THE TUBE : T minus 0 seconds. Observe for fasciculations approximately 90 seconds after succinylcholine to indicate imminent paralysis. After paralysis is achieved, follow Orotracheal Intubation - 5.8 to place the ETT.PARAMEDIC - PREREQUISITES REQUIRED SUCCINYLCHOLINE CONTRAINDICATIONS: Extensive recent burns or crush injuries > 24 hours old. Known or suspected hyperkalemia. History of malignant hyperthermia.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.0 EMS personnel may request Air Medical Transport (AMT) when operational and/or clinical conditions exist that would benefit from decreasing time to definitive care and/or advanced clinical capabilities offered by the AMT team. The use of AMT is determined by the prehospital provider with the highest medical level providing patient care. It should not be determined by police or bystanders. AMT does not require approval of on -line Medical Direction . However, if in doubt of the appropriateness of a patient for AMT, please contact Medical Direction as soon as possible. OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS When a patient meets the defined clinical criteria listed below and the ground transport time to the closest hospital capable of providing definitive care (e.g., Level I or 2 trauma hospital, PCI center, stroke center) exceeds the ETA of air medical transport, OR Patient location, weather, or road conditions preclude the use of ambulance, OR Multiple patients are present that will exceed the capabilities of local hospital and agencie s, OR Advanced clinical capabilities offered by the air medical team are needed. The air medical team may respond by ground or intercept as appropriate. In general, the patient should begin movement toward the appropriate receiving facility as soon as practical. Consider landing zones to minimize total field time. CLINICAL CONDITIONS Severe respiratory compromise with respiratory arrest or abnormal respiratory rate. Circulatory insufficiency: sustained MAP < 65 (systolic blood pressure <90mmHg) in adults, age - appropriate hypotension in children, or other signs of shock. Neurologic compromise: total GCS < 9, or motor component < 5. If the patient 's neurologic status improves above these limits, consider canceling the helicopter and transporting to the local hospital. Trauma: All penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso, and extremities proximal to elbow or knee; chest wall instability or deformity (e.g., flail chest); two or more proximal long crushed, degloved, or proximal to wrist or ankle; pelvic fracture; open or depressed skull fracture; paralysis. Burns: Major burns with greater than 20% BSA and/or inhalation injury with risk of airway compromise. Electrocution injuries with loss of consciousness, arrhythmia, or any respiratory abnormality. STEMI: If 12 -lead ECG indicates a STEMI (e.g., machine indicates ***Acute MI Suspected*** and/or Paramedic interpretation). Stroke: 1 or more abnormal signs of the stroke scale; and consistent with local stroke plans. Critically ill children, including those with acute decompensation of chronic and/or special healthcare needs. ADDITIONAL NOTES Patients with an uncontrolled airway or uncontrollable hemorrhage should be brought to the nearest hospital unless advanced life support (ALS) service (by ground or air) can intercept in a more timely fashion. AMT is NOT indicated for patients in cardiac arrest (except for hypothermic arrest ). Should the patient go into cardiac arrest after AMT request, the AMT crew may be utilized for resuscitation and stabilization. AMT is NOT indicated for a contaminated patient until AFTER decontamination. AMT may be indicated in a wide range of conditions other than those listed above. In cases where the patient 's status is uncertain, consult with Medical Direction and proceed as directed. Transfers from ground -ambulance to air -ambulance shall occur at the closest appropriate landing site, including a hospital heliport, an airport, or an unimproved landing site deemed safe per AMT crew discretion. In cases where a hospital heliport is used strictly as the ground -to-air ambulance transfer point, no transfer of care to the hospital is implied or should be assumed by hospital personnel, unless specifically requested by the EMS providers.20132013Baby Safe Haven Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS In 2006, the Vermont Legislature passed legislation known as the Baby Safe Haven Law. This legislation provides a mechanism for parents to surrender infants up to 30 days old at locations and facilities that are capable of safeguarding the child and avoiding abandonment of extremely vulnerable infants. In that the language of the statute specifies 9 -1-1 emergency responders at a location where the responder and the person have agreed to transfer the child as a Safe Haven location, it is possible that EMS personnel and organizations may receive infants. If another organization receives the infant, EMS may play a role in transporting the child to an emergency department for any necessary medical care and transition to custody of the Department for Children and Families staff. The text of the legislation reads: SHORT TITLE - This act shall be known as the \"Baby Safe Haven Law. \" LEGISLATIVE INTENT -It is the intent of the general assembly that this act provide a procedure which ensures the safety and well -being of newborns and infants. The general assembly recognizes that it is preferable for a wide array of services to be available to all expectant mothers and to newborn infants and their mothers. The procedure established in this act should be considered a safeguard that will be followed only in extraordinary circumstances. Sec. 3. 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 1303 is amended to read: Sec 3. 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 1303. ABANDONMENT OR EXPOSURE OF BABY (a) A person who abandons or exposes a child under the age of two years, whereby the life or health of such child is endangered, shall be imprisoned not more than ten years or fined not more than $10,000.00, or both. (b) (1) It is not a violation of this section if a person voluntarily delivers a child not more than 30 days of age to: (A) An employee, staff member, or volunteer at a health care facility. (B) An employee, staff member, or volunteer at a fire station, police station, place of worship, or an entity that is licensed or authorized in this state to place minors for adoption. (C) A 9-1-1 emergency responder at a location where the responder and the person have agreed to transfer the child. (2) A person voluntarily delivering a child under this subsection shall not be required to reveal any personally identifiable information, but may be offered the opportunity to provide information concerning the child 's or family 's medical history. (3) A person or facility to whom a child is delivered pursuant to this subsection shall be immune from civil or criminal liability for any action taken pursuant to this subsection. (4) A person or facility to whom a child is delivered pursuant to this subsection shall: (A) Take temporary custody of the child and ensure that he or she receives any necessary medical care. (B) Provide notice that he, she, or it has taken temporary custody of the child to a law enforcement agency. (C) Provide notice that he, she, or it has taken temporary custody of the child to the Department for Children and Family Services, which shall take custody of the child as soon as practicable. 20238.1Baby Safe Haven Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.1 While the statute does not specifically mention EMS personnel or organizations, EMS may become involved as a 9 -1-1 emergency responder. It is also likely that EMS will be involved when an infant is delivered to any other Safe Haven. Delivery of an infant to a Safe Haven location will be an infrequent but very stressful event. Infants being delivered to the Safe Haven are at considerable risk and every possible step to safeguard the health and welfare of the infant should be taken. A person delivering an infant under the provisions of the Baby Safe Haven law may not make the subtle distinctions between EMS facilities and other Safe Haven locations specifically mentioned in the law. EMS personnel and organizations should be prepared to play an appropriate role in the receipt of infants delivered under the provisions of the Baby Safe Haven law. EMS may be summoned by a Safe Haven that receives an infant (fire, police, place of worship, adoption agency, or health care facility). Guidance being provided by the Department for Children and Families for Safe Havens suggests that when an infant is received, the Safe Haven should call an ambulance to provide treatment and transportation. The primary roles of EMS in a Baby Safe Haven encounter are as with any other patient: assess, provide treatment as indicated, transport to a hospital. EMS organizations with stations that could be unoccupied may wish to consider signage on entryways indicating that persons wishing to deliver an infant under the provisions of the Baby Safe Haven law should call 9 -1-1 to make arrangements if the station is not staffed and should not leave an infant unattended. EMS organizations may wish to reach out to Safe Haven locations in their primary service area to coordinate procedures and develop local plans for handling Safe Haven encounters. To order additional copies of Safe Haven posters and brochures, call 802 -241-2131. To find out about training opportunities from the Department for Children and Families, call 800 -649- 4357 or go to babysafehaven.vermont.gov PROCEDURE Although EMS organizations and personnel are not specifically mentioned in the Baby Safe Haven statute, as 9 -1-1 emergency responders, EMS needs to be familiar with the provisions of the law and work to facilitate the protection of infants being received. When involved in a Baby Safe Haven encounter, upon receiving physical custody of the baby, whether you receive an infant from the parent, a Safe Haven, or another third party, examine the baby and provide any treatment necessary according to the appropriate clinical protocol(s). If possible, offer the person delivering the infant the Safe Haven brochure published by the Agency of Human Services if the infant is not picked up at a Safe Haven. If it has not already been done, attempt to advise the person delivering the infant into a Safe Haven that while she/he is not required to reveal any identifying information, she/he can provide information about the child 's medical history using the voluntary medical form that is attached to the DCF Safe Haven brochure. Encourage the person to complete the form and leave it with you. If the form is left with you, complete the information at the bottom of it with the date you received the baby and your location. This information should be delivered to the DCF Family Services staff person. Document this information on your EMS patient care report form as well. Document on your EMS patient care report any additional information about the child, the birthparents, and/or the situation that is observed or offered voluntarily, including any names the person is willing to provide.

Baby Safe Haven Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. Transport the infant to the hospital once appropriate EMS treatment has begun. If you receive an infant from a parent or other person, at the earliest possible opportunity, call the police of jurisdiction where you received the child and the local DCF, Family Services District Office or DCF Emergency Services contact to report what has happened (see list attached). The EMS personnel involved may have information about the parent, the circumstances of receiving the child, etc. that will be important to law enforcement and the DCF Family Services personnel, so it is important for the EMS personnel involved to make this contact. If you receive an infant from another Safe Haven, assure that the original receiver(s) have made the police and DCF contacts. Important: Once you have physical custody of the infant, always transport the child to a hospital. If the person who delivered the infant or another person comes back to you requesting the return of the baby, do not give the baby back. Instead, instruct the person to contact the Department of Children and Families at 800 -649-4357. They will be referred to a social worker, who will assist them with the process. Urge them to act quickly, before a judge has terminated their parental rights.

The Vermont EMS system strives to provide all patients, including bariatric patients, with timely and effective care that preserves the comfort, safety and dignity of the patients and ensures the safety of providers. At times, even a single patient can exceed the capacity of the immediately available resources. Like a multi -system trauma patient, a bariatric patient requires: Appropriate EMS resources to respond. Appropriate protocols and equipment for the provision of care. Specialized equipment for transfer to the ambulance and transport. Careful selection of the appropriate destination hospital. Pre-alerting of the ED to ensure adequate resources to manage the patient. On scene times that may be significantly extended for bariatric patients. EQUIPMENT Deployment of equipment and procedures shall be done under local or regional operating guidelines. DEFINITIONS A bariatric patient is a patient whose: Weight exceeds 400 pounds, OR Weight, girth, body contours and/or co -morbidities challenge the ability of a two - person EMS crew to effectively manage. DISPATCH Bariatric Ambulance: If available, consider requesting a bariatric transport ambulance to respond to the scene. Resources should be requested as soon as it becomes clear that bariatric capabilities may be required. While standard ambulance stretchers can potentially handle some patients up to 750 pounds or more, the use of a specialized bariatric stretcher increases the ability to provide effective care, is more comfortable for the patient and enhances provider safety. Additional Personnel: Consider requesting additional responders. Bariatric patients may require additional personnel to participate in lifting and moving. For significant extrications, consider designating a Safety Officer to oversee the safety of the operation in conjunction with Incident Command. It may be necessary to remove doors, walls or windows to carry out a safe extrication. The priorities are similar to extrication from a vehicle, although fixed property repair costs might be higher. Paramedic: Consider requesting a paramedic. Even BLS bariatric patients present unique treatment challenges which may benefit from a higher level of care. MEDICAL CARE Medical care must take into account the unique challenges presented by the bariatric patient as well as the likelihood of extended on -scene times. Providers should use appropriately sized equipment to the extent it is available or can be readily obtained. For example, an appropriately sized blood pressure cuff will need to be used and intramuscular injection will be given with a longer needle. If there are significant barriers to removing the patient from the structure in a timely manner (long narrow stairs, patient in the attic, etc.), there may be situations where EMS will provide extended care to the patient at the scene. In such cases, consult Medical Direction and consider use of the extended care protocols. Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 2023Bariatric Triage, Care & Transport 8.2TRANSFER TO AMBULANCE Specialized equipment will be needed to transfer the patient safely from the scene to the ambulance stretcher for transport. Many services utilize large transfer flats for moving bariatric patients. Be sure before you use any patient transfer device that you understand the procedure for using it safely and that you know the weight limits of the device. HOSPITAL DESTINATION Ensure that you select a destination hospital that has the capabilities to care for your patient. Bariatric patients may require specialized hospital stretchers, CT scanners, catheterization laboratory equipment, operating room equipment, etc. It may be appropriate to consider an alternate destination after consultation with Medical Direction . Pre -notification serves both to ensure that the hospital is capable of caring for the patient and allows hospital staff time for adequate preparation. Communication with the hospital shall be in a professional manner. Respect for the patient's privacy and feelings will match the respect for all EMS patients. TRANSPORT TO THE HOSPITAL A bariatric stretcher should be used to transport the patient to the hospital and equipment cache transfer devices may be utilized to facilitate transfer of the patient to the hospital stretcher. Be alert to ensure that the stretcher is adequately secured in the patient compartment. Transfer flats or other specialized transfer equipment may be left in place to facilitate transfer of the patient to the hospital stretcher. Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.3 PEARLS It may be difficult to establish IV and IO access. Consider intramuscular or intranasal as alternatives for some medications. For IM, ensure that the needle used is sufficiently long. Weight -based calculations may yield inappropriately large doses in obese patients. Consult with Medical Direction when in doubt. Bariatric patients often have decreased functional residual capacity, and are at risk of rapid desaturation. Extremely obese individuals require more oxygen than non -obese individuals due to their diminished lung capacity. Pulse oximetry may not be reliable due to poor circulation. Even patients without respiratory distress may not tolerate the supine position. Bariatric patients may present with severe airway challenges. Carefully plan your approach to the airway, and be prepared with backup airway plans. If the patient has had recent bariatric surgery, possible complications may include anemia, dehydration, hypoglycemia, leakage, ulcers, localized infection, sepsis, etc.Bariatric Triage, Care & Transport 8.2Communications Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.3 EMS practitioners should routinely advise the receiving hospital, in a timely manner, of patients enroute to that Emergency Department (except in Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI) during which routine communications cease). Follow guidelines below or local receiving hospital protocol. An EMS practitioner may establish contact with a Medical Direction physician via VHF radio on one of the assigned medical frequencies or via telephone direct to each Emergency Department (via recorded EMS line, if available). If a Medical Direction physician is needed for consultation, request this before giving patient information. It is recommended that hospitals record all medical communications. VHF MEDICAL FREQUENCIES Initiate call to the appropriate hospital and identify: o Destination hospital o Ambulance unit calling o Status of the patient TELEPHONE To contact the destination hospital via telephone, use of a direct -recorded line to the Emergency Department is recommended. Request Medical Direction, if needed, give the name of the patient, patient 's age, status, and complaint. Upon establishing voice communication with the destination hospital/medical direction physician (if needed), present the following information in a concise and clear manner: Emergency response unit and level of care: Paramedic/Advanced -EMT/EMT, with ETA. Advise if the patient meets the criteria for stroke, trauma, STEMI or sepsis alert. Patient 's age, sex, and level of consciousness. Patient 's chief complaint. Patient 's present medical condition. Patient 's vital signs, including level of consciousness. Patient 's physical signs of illness or injury. Patient 's electrocardiogram rhythm, if indicated. Patient 's relevant medical history. Prehospital diagnostic tests performed/results and treatment rendered/results. Give a list of medications and allergies only if requested by the destination hospital, or if it is anticipated that a medication order would be given by Medical Direction. In case of a communications failure with Medical Direction due to equipment (cell phone, landline, radio) malfunction or incident location, the following will apply: EMS personnel may, within the limits of their level of licensure, perform necessary procedures described in these protocols that under normal circumstances would require online Medical Direction. These procedures shall be the minimum necessary to prevent the loss of life or the critical deterioration of a patient 's condition. All procedures performed under this order, and the conditions that created the communications failure, need to be thoroughly documented. Attempts must be made to establish contact with Medical Direction as soon as possible. The EMS practitioner shall provide a written notification pertaining to the communications failure describing the events, including the patient 's condition and treatment given, and referencing the EMS Incident Report. This report must be filed with the EMS District Medical Advisor and/or Hospital EMS Coordinator within 24 hours of the event. Communications Failure Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.4A \"minor \" is a person who has not yet reached his/her eighteenth birthday. Note that the legal definition of a \"minor \" for purposes of consent is unrelated to the medical definitions of \"pediatric patient, \" \"child, \" and \"children, \" as used in these protocols. EMS personnel may treat minors under the doctrine of implied consent when the minor 's parent or other authorized representative is unavailable to provide expressed consent. With the exception of life - threatening emergencies, personnel should attempt to contact the minor 's parent or legal guardian to obtain informed consent to treat and transport the child. When a parent or legal guardian is unavailable, another authorized representative (e.g., a school or camp official), who has been expressly authorized by the minor 's parent, may consent to health care treatment. A parent or legal guardian may refuse care for a minor: When a parent or legal guardian is not reasonably available, another adult family member (e.g., grandparent), or other authorized representative having custody of the minor, may refuse care. EMS personnel may accept a telephonic refusal of care, provided that they have explained the consequences of refusing care; telephonic refusal of care should be carefully documented. Except for the special circumstances listed below, a minor may not refuse care. When a minor attempts to refuse care and/or transport to the hospital, EMS personnel should enlist the assistance of the police, including requesting that the police place the minor in protective custody. Minors should be restrained only as a last resort. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES A minor parent who has not yet reached his/her eighteenth birthday may consent to or refuse care on behalf of his or her minor children, provided that the minor parent has the capacity to understand the nature of the treatment and the possible consequences of consenting to or refusing care. Contact Medical Direction to discuss consent/refusals regarding minors. Always attempt to provide medical care that is in the best interest of the minor. Minors of any age may give informed consent to medical treatment associated with rape, incest or sexual abuse. An emancipated minor may consent to, or refuse, care. A minor patient bears the burden of establishing, by legal documentation or otherwise, that he/she is emancipated. Vermont recognizes emancipation decrees lawfully obtained in other states ( 12 VSA \u00a77157 ).Consent for Treatment of a Minor Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.5If you have been dispatched to a possible crime scene, including motor vehicle incidents, or if you believe a crime has been committed, immediately contact law enforcement. Protect yourself and other EMS personnel. You will not be held liable for failing to act if a scene is not safe to enter. Once a crime scene is deemed safe by law enforcement, initiate patient contact and medical care if necessary. Have all EMS practitioners use the same path of entry and exit, if feasible. Do not walk through fluids. Do not touch or move anything at a crime scene unless it is necessary to do so for patient care (notify law enforcement prior to moving if possible). Observe and document original location of items moved by crew. When removing patient clothing, leave it intact as much as possible. o Do not cut through clothing holes made by gunshot or stabbing If you remove any items from the scene, such as impaled objects or medication bottles, document your actions and advise a law enforcement official. Do not sacrifice patient care to preserve evidence. Consider requesting a law enforcement officer to accompany the patient in the ambulance to the hospital. Document statements made by the patient or bystanders on the EMS patient care report. o Comments made by a patient or bystanders should be denoted in quotation marks Inform staff at the receiving hospital that this is a \"crime scene \" patient. If the patient is obviously dead consistent with Resuscitation Initiation and Termination - 8.17, notify law enforcement of decision not to initiate resuscitation/patient care. At motor vehicle incidents, preserve the scene by not driving over debris, not moving debris and parking away from tire marks, if feasible.Crime Scene/ Preservation of Evidence Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.6Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/ Clinician Orders For Life Sustaining Treatment (COLST) Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. TO BE VALID DNR/COLST ORDERS MUST MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: DNR Orders must: o Be signed by the patient's clinician. A verbal order documented with the clinician 's name, and signed and dated by the patient 's nurse or social worker is acceptable. o Certify that the clinician has consulted, or made an effort to consult, with the patient, and the patient's agent or guardian, if there is an appointed agent or guardian. Signature by the clinician serves as certification that they have attempted to consult with patient. o Must include: the name of the patient, agent or guardian giving informed consent OR meet the futility standard (Section A). COLST Orders must: o Be signed by the patient's clinician. A verbal order documented with the clinician 's name, and signed and dated by the patient 's nurse or social worker is acceptable. Include the name of the patient, agent or guardian giving informed consent. 20238.7 PEARLS One essential element of providing quality end -of-life care involves honoring patient preferences. In the past a Do -Not-Resuscitate Order (DNR) has been used when a patient does not wish to have Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). In recent years the old \"DNR \" order has been incorporated into a new form known as the DNR/COLST order by the Vermont Department of Health. The old \"DNR \" order only dealt with CPR. The DNR/COLST order deals with CPR as well as intubation, transfer to hospital, antibiotics, hydration and overall goals of care and is the only legal out -of-hospital DNR order in Vermont as of July 1, 2011. The DNR/COLST form was updated in 2022. Orders documented on prior VDH -approved DNR/COLST forms remain valid. Healthcare and residential care facilities can document these orders in a facility specific manner for inpatients. DNR/COLST is a more complete document that stands for: Do Not Resuscitate Order/Clinician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment. These are medical orders intended to reflect a patient's current medical condition and their goals and values resulting in a treatment plan regarding use of CPR, intubation, transfer to hospital, artificial nutrition and hydration, use of antibiotics and other relevant medical goals. EMS personnel are required to perform CPR if indicated for a victim of cardiac arrest unless there is a signed DNR/COLST order in the out -of-hospital setting or termination of resuscitation criteria are met ( Resuscitation Initiation and Termination - 8.17). All forms of DNR/COLST remain valid during a transfer from one healthcare facility to another.All out -of-hospital DNR/COLST orders are mandated to be on the Department of Health's Vermont DNR/COLST form . DNR orders signed prior to July 1, 2011 may continue to be recognized as valid for EMS encounters, if the document complies with statutory requirements. All DNR/COLST orders on the prior Vermont DNR/COLST form that comply with statutory requirements remain legal and valid and shall be honored. Health care facilities and residential care facilities may document DNR/COLST orders in the patient's medical record in a facility specific manner when the patient is in their care so long as they meet the criteria below.Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/ Clinician Orders For Life Sustaining Treatment (COLST) Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. PROCEDURE Patients should be assessed per routine procedures and if resuscitation is or may be needed, EMS personnel should make reasonable efforts to check the patient for a DNR identification (bracelet, necklace, anklet) or inquire if there is a written DNR/COLST order available. Attempt to determine the identity of the patient (specifically, name and date of birth). If The Patient/Resident Has No Pulse And/Or No Respirations: o Go to Section A of the DNR/COLST form. If the DNR order is checked and there is a clinician signature, a verbal order documented, and signed and dated by the patient 's nurse or social worker, or the patient has a DNR identification - Do Not initiate CPR or other resuscitation measures. Do not perform chest compressions or assist ventilations via BVM. Do not intubate or place advanced airway devices. Do not defibrillate. Do not administer resuscitation drugs to treat cardiac arrest or dysrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, pulseless electrical activity, or asystole). When Confronted With A Seriously Ill Patient Who Is Not In Cardiac Arrest But Is Breathing And/Or Has A Pulse: o Go to Sections B - D of the DNR/COLST form to review Orders for Other Life -Sustaining Treatment. Instructions for Intubation/Ventilation in the event of respiratory distress are in Section B. Medical intervention guidelines including use of noninvasive airway support and comfort -focused treatment is in Section C. Orders for other life sustaining treatments (nutrition, hydration, antibiotics) are in Section D. o Check for clinician signature. A verbal order documented with the clinician 's name, and signed and dated by the patient 's nurse or social worker is acceptable. 20238.7 PEARLS A DNR Order (Section A of the DNR/COLST form) only precludes efforts to resuscitate in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest an d does not affect other therapeutic interventions that may be appropriate for the patient. (Sections B through D of the COLST form address other interventions). EMS providers and other health care professionals must honor a DNR order or a DNR identification unless it is believed in goo d faith, after consultation with the patient, agent or guardian, where possible and appropriate: o That the patient wishes to have the DNR Order revoked if the Order is based on informed consent, or o That the patient with the DNR identification or order is not the individual for whom the DNR order was issued. A health care provider shall honor in good faith an out -of-state DNR order, orders for life sustaining treatment, or out -of- state DNR identification if there is no reason to believe that what has been presented is invalid. Statutory requirements for DNR or DNR/COLST require that the order be signed by the patient 's clinician, or a verbal order documented, and signed and dated by the patient 's nurse or social worker, and include the name of the patient/ agent/guardian or other individual giving informed consent and their relationship to the patient. In the absence of a valid DNR or DNR/COLST order, neither a spouse nor a healthcare agent/durable power of attorney may direct you to withhold resuscitation in the event of a cardiac arrest. Contact Medical Direction for guidance. Photocopies and faxes of signed DNR/COLST forms are legal and valid. An Advanced Directive (formerly referred to as Living Will) is different than DNR/COLST. An Advance Directive is a preferenc e-based document completed by a capacitated patient and is not actionable in an out -of-hospital emergency. A DNR/COLST order is a medical order, completed by a clinician (MD, DO, PA, APRN), requiring informed consent (which may be provided by a health care agent, guardian or surrogate if the patient lacks capacity) which shall be honored by all health care providers, including EMS. Contact Medical Direction for circumstances not specifically covered by this protocol.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.8 EMT/ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS E Routine Patient Care. Contact the hospice team (preferred) or Medical Direction to coordinate care and determine administration of hospice kit medications. Consider paramedic response for medication administration. Breakthrough Pain : Suggest administration of breakthrough pain medication by patients / families. For pain of sudden onset, seek to determine and ameliorate or treat the underlying cause (e.g., pathological fracture). Anxiety : Consider potential causes for patient 's anxiety, such as increased pain and shortness of breath. Dyspnea : Administer oxygen via nasal cannula to relieve shortness of breath and achieve a respiration rate of < 20. Use a fan to blow air directly at the patient 's face. Constipation : Suggest administration of constipation medication by patient/family. Nausea/Vomiting : Suggest administration of nausea medication by patient/family. Terminal Secretions : Reassure family that noisy breathing is generally not distressing to the patient. Suggest administration of medication by patients/families. Terminal Dehydration : Moisten lips with petroleum jelly; use artificial saliva/mouth sponges and ice chips. Confusion/Delirium : Speak slowly and calmly to the person. Remind the patient of where they are, and who you are. Avoid contradicting the patient 's statements. Ensure a patient 's hearing aid and glasses are available. Limit activity/noise in the room.This protocol is specific to those patients enrolled in Hospice. Treatment should be based on consultation with their Hospice team. Introduction The treatment goals of hospice patients differ significantly from those of other patients. Maintaining patient dignity and quality of life, rather than treating medical conditions, is the objective. If a specific cause of discomfort is identified (e.g., bronchospasm), traditional EMS treatment may be appropriate depending on the invasiveness of the therapy and the patient 's preferences. Hospice patients generally wish to remain at home and transport to the hospital should be the exception. Many hospice patients will have a hospice comfort kit that contains medications that patient 's caregivers are instructed to use to treat commonly encountered medical issues. If the patient is unable to make medical decisions and the hospice team cannot be contacted, determine the patient 's wishes and contact Medical Direction. EMS practitioners should avoid the following interventions: Sirens, lights or aggressive interventions with family or caregivers. IV therapy (except where other forms of medication administration are not possible). Cardiac resuscitation: CPR, resuscitation medications, BVM ventilations. Cardiac pacing, cardioversion, and defibrillation. Hospice patients should not be transported to the hospital except where transport is specifically requested by the patient or their healthcare agent or surrogate, and preferably only after consultation with the hospice team and exhaustion of other treatment pathways that do not require transport to the hospital.Hospice Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 2023PPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS Consider following the written orders for medications in hospice kit. As an adjunct to the hospice kit medication consider: Breakthrough Pain : See Pain Management - 2.20A (all IV formulated opiates may be given PO for hospice patients) Anxiety : Midazolam: 2.5 mg IN, repeat every 10 - 15 minutes as needed to a maximum of 7.5mg Lorazepam: 0.25 - 2 mg PO or SL. Dyspnea : Morphine or other opiate, dosing per Pain Management - 2.20A , maintaining respiratory rate above 8 bpm. Bronchospasm: See Asthma/COPD/RAD - 2.4A, subject to patient 's goals. Heart Failure: See Congestive Heart Failure (Pulmonary Edema) - 3.3, subject to patient 's goals. PEARLS Breakthrough pain assessment and management is important in patients with advanced disease as they may have a high burden of pain, be opiate tolerant, and already be receiving high doses of opioids. Anxiety ranges from mild to severe, is common in patients nearing death, and should be treated promptly. Terminal secretions are noisy, gurgling respirations caused by secretions accumulating in the lungs or oropharynx. Terminal dyspnea is exhibited by patients that are expected to die within hours to days. Individuals experiencing dyspnea often experience heightened anxiety. Constipation is a frequent cause of nausea and vomiting. Opioid -related constipation is dose - related, and patients do not develop tolerance to this side effect. Surgical treatment is often not appropriate. Nausea / Vomiting can be extremely debilitating symptoms at the end of life. Effective control of nausea can be achieved in most patients. Fever and infection treatment should be guided by an understanding of where the patient is in the dying trajectory and goals of care. Overwhelming sepsis may be a sign of death not to be reversed. Delirium is common at end of life and is often caused by a combination of medications, dehydration, infections or hypoxia. It is distressing to families. It often heralds the end of life and may require sedation. Though patients in hospice have decided not to pursue further treatment for their underlying condition, these patients can and do still require transport by EMS for acute problems unrelated to their underlying condition, and should be treated according to local and state protocols, as well as the patient 's hospice plan.8.8 ANausea / Vomiting : Reference Nausea/Vomiting - 2.14.EMT/ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERSEMT/ ADVANCED EMT / PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS E A P/ /E A P/ / Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

Rapid identification of, and interventions for VAD -related malfunctions or complications. Indications Adult patients that have had an implantable ventricular assist device (VAD) including Left Ventricular Assist ventricular assist device (RVADs); and biventricular -assist devices (BiVADs) and have symptoms of cardiovascular compromise. Patients with VADs that are in cardiac arrest. Patients with VADs that are experiencing a medical or injury -related event not involving the cardiovascular system or VAD malfunction. Contraindications Adult patients who do not have a VAD in place. Assessment: Assess for possible pump malfunction o Assess for alarms o Auscultate for pump sound \"hum\" o Signs of hypoperfusion including pallor, diaphoresis, altered mental status If the VAD pump has malfunctioned - o Utilize available resources to troubleshoot potential VAD malfunctions and to determine appropriate corrective actions to restore normal VAD function: Contact the patient 's VAD -trained companion, if available Contact the patient 's VAD coordinator, using the phone number on the device Check all the connections to system controller Change VAD batteries, and/or change system controller if indicated Have patient stop all activity and assess for patient tolerance Follow appropriate cardiovascular condition -specific protocol(s) as indicated Treatment and Interventions: Manage airway as indicated. Cardiac monitoring. IV Access. Acquire 12 -lead ECG. Transmit if possible. If patient is experiencing VAD -related complications or cardiovascular problems, expedite transport to a tertiary care facility if patient 's clinical condition and time allows. If patient has a functioning VAD and is experiencing a non -cardiovascular - related problem, transport to a facility that is appropriate for the patient 's main presenting problem without manipulating the device.8.9Implantable Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.10 BACKGROUND EMS practitioners are often called to provide lifting assistance. This assistance can vary but often involves an individual who has fallen or slipped and is now unable to get up or return to bed without assistance. In all calls from an individual or responsible party requesting lifting assistance, a medical evaluation must be completed looking for any injury, underlying medical process that contributed to this event, or for a deterioration in functional ability. PROCEDURE Initial evaluation should begin by assessing for any suspected medical cause or inability to mobilize (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, new weakness or balance problem, dehydration/poor oral intake, visual disturbance, recent illness or infection, etc.). Assess vital signs to include HR, RR, BP, SpO 2. In some instances, based on patient 's past medical history or provider discretion, a temperature, EtCO 2, EKG and blood glucose should also be checked. Determine if any acute injury or medical condition exists. Ascertain the duration of down time if found on the ground/floor. Consider hypothermia, compartment syndrome, or rhabdomyolysis and treat accordingly. Determine if patient is on any oral anticoagulants which may increase risk level for unrecognized bleeding and may prompt recommendation for transport. Transport should be recommended to patients that exhibit altered mental status, any loss of consciousness, suspected medical reason for fall, abnormal vital signs including BGFS or ETCO 2 if obtained, signs of new trauma, or use of anticoagulants (blood thinners). Those who decline transport should be evaluated for medical decision -making capacity and the informed refusal of care process should be followed. Advise patient that they may call 911 if they develop any symptoms. Refusal of Care should be followed and documented carefully as described in Refusal of Care 8.15. A SIREN report will be completed when a patient receives an assessment, assistance (i.e. lift assist), advice, or treatment by EMS personnel.Naloxone Leave Behind Overdose Rescue Program Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols MAY NOT BE altered or modified. E A P/ /E A P/ /PURPOSE To identify and provide At -Risk Persons with a Naloxone Leave Behind Kit, along with instructions on harm reduction and how to access treatment. DEFINITION At-Risk Persons are those individuals who: Have indications of opioid or other substance use disorder (OUD/SUD) - o Indicators of SUD may include patient confirmation of opioid or other illicit substance use, concern expressed by others on scene, presence of drug paraphernalia, clinical signs and symptoms, OR o Just experienced an overdose, OR o Answers yes to the single question drug use screening test (see below) 20238.11 Review instructions found in the Naloxone Leave Behind Kit with the recipient, including proper use, local recovery resources, and available linkage to treatment. Contact Medical Direction for patients who refuse transport ( Refusal of Care and Patient Non -Transport Form - 8.15). Offer a Naloxone Leave Behind Kit to any: o At-Risk person who refuses transport o Patients who used Naloxone on scene prior to EMS arrival o Family, friends, or others on scene who may be in a position to help in an overdose emergency DOCUMENTATION Document use of the Naloxone Leave Behind Overdose Rescue Program in SIREN.PROCEDURE Identify an At -Risk Person based upon the definition above. Perform single question Drug Use Screening Test by asking: o \"In the past year, have you used substances or prescription medications for non - medical or recreational reasons? \" o If the answer is yes, consider the patient an At -Risk Person Treat according to Vermont Statewide EMS Protocols. Consider Poisoning/ Substance Abuse/Overdose - 2.21A or Poisoning/Substance Abuse/Overdose 2.21P , Altered Mental - 2.3A or Altered Mental Status - 2.3P. Overdose patients who were administered Naloxone by EMS or prior to EMS arrival should be encouraged to accept transport to the emergency department. Advise At -Risk persons that immediate OUD/SUD treatment is available through any Vermont emergency department. Naloxone Leave Behind Kits may be given to both transported and non -transported patients, regardless of the initial call reason.NALOXONE LEAVE BEHIND KIT CONTENTS Naloxone spray, instruction on harm reduction and how to access treatment, and other available harm reduction resources.BACKGROUND Opioid overdoses, especially those involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, have become the leading cause of injury -related death in the United States. Fentanyl is often mixed, without the user 's knowledge, into heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, or any other pill or powder not obtained from a pharmacy, leading to a high risk of fatal overdose for any form of substance use.Non-EMS Personnel at the Emergency Scene Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.12 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Emergency medical care is a continuum involving the concerted, integrated efforts of prehospital providers, physicians, nurses, allied health personnel, clergy and mental health workers. Recognizing this offers a guide for dealing with non -prehospital providers who wish to render assistance on the scene of an emergency. NON -PHYSICIAN INTERVENTION ON THE SCENE (Nurses, midwives, physician assistants, allied health personnel, clergy, mental health workers, etc.) Control of the medical care at an emergency scene is the responsibility of the individual in attendance who is most appropriately trained and knowledgeable in providing prehospital emergency stabilization and transport. With few exceptions, this is the on -duty responding EMS licensee of the highest license level. The intervener should be thanked by a member of the responding EMS crew and be asked to report any care that was provided prior to EMS arrival. Confrontation should be avoided whenever possible. The appropriate involvement of non -prehospital providers should be determined by the licensed responding prehospital providers. On-line medical direction should be sought for situations where a cooperative working relationship is failing or has failed, or the non -prehospital provider refuses to relinquish care of the patient. In any circumstance where the prehospital provider believes that care proposed by an intervener deviates from protocols, follow these protocols and seek on -line medical direction. PHYSICIAN INTERVENTION ON THE SCENE Prehospital providers control an emergency scene, even in the presence of a physician. When EMS personnel encounter a person claiming to be a physician at the scene, one of the prehospital providers should take reasonable steps to verify the identity of the physician without restricting the physician's access to provide potentially lifesaving care. Patient 's private physician. o If the patient's private physician is present and assumes responsibility for the patient's care, the prehospital provider should generally defer to the orders of the private physician within the limits of the provider's training and licensure o Medical direction should be contacted o The private physician should be expected to accompany the patient to the hospital if interventions beyond the scope and practice of the providers have occurred o The prehospital provider reverts back to following these protocols and on -line medical direction at any time when the patient's private physician is no longer in attendance Not the patient 's private physician. o If on-line medical direction CANNOT be established: The prehospital provider should generally relinquish responsibility for the patient's care when the physician has identified himself and has indicated a willingness to assume responsibility and document any interventions when this care appears competent and appropriate. Always act in the best interest of the patient The prehospital provider should defer to the wishes of the physician on the scene within the limits of the provider's training and licensure If the care and treatment differ from these protocols, the physician must agree in advance to accompany the patient to the hospital In the event of a mass casualty incident or disaster, patient care needs may require the physician to remain at the scene o The prehospital provider reverts back to following these protocols and on -line medical direction at any time when this physician is no longer in attendance o If on-line medical direction CAN be established: The on -line physician is ultimately responsible Should any disagreement between the physician on the scene and the on -line physician exist, the prehospital provider should follow the orders from the on -line physician and place the intervener physician in contact with the on -line physician The on -line physician has the option of managing the case entirely, working with the physician, or allowing the on -scene physician to assume responsibility The details of any encounter with an intervener should be documented. Include the intervener's name, qualifications, and any care provided by the intervener.Pediatric Transportation Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. PATIENT TRANSPORT 23 VSA \u00a71258 requires all children to be properly restrained when riding in a vehicle. An ill or injured child must be restrained in a manner that minimizes injury in an ambulance crash. The best location for transporting a pediatric patient is on the ambulance cot. The method of restraint will be determined by various circumstances including the child 's medical condition and weight. Child passengers should never be transported in a side -facing orientation (i.e. on a bench seat or CPR chair). 1. Convertible car seat with two belt paths (front and back) with four points for belt attachment to the cot is considered best practice for pediatric patients who can tolerate a semi -upright position. Position safety seat on cot facing foot -end with backrest fully elevated to meet the back of the child safety seat. Secure safety seat with 2 pairs of belts at both forward and rear points of seat. Place shoulder straps of the harness through slots just below child 's shoulders and fasten snugly to child. Follow manufacturer 's guidelines regarding child's weight. Note: Non-convertible safety seats cannot be secured safely to cot. If child 's personal safety seat is not a convertible seat, it cannot be used on the cot. 2. Stretcher harness device with 5 -point harness (examples: Ferno Pedi -Mate, SafeGuard Transport, ACR) Attach securely to cot utilizing upper back strap behind cot and lower straps around cot's frame. 5-point harness must rest snugly against child. Adjust head portion of cot according to manufacturer 's recommendation. Follow manufacturer 's guidelines regarding weight. 3. Car bed with both a front and rear belt path For infants who cannot tolerate a semi -upright position or who must lie flat. Position car bed so infant lies perpendicular to cot, keeping infant 's head toward center of patient compartment. Fully raise backrest and anchor car bed to cot with 2 belts, utilizing 4 loop straps supplied with car bed. Only appropriate for infants from 5 - 20 lbs. 20238.13 Pediatric Transportation Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 4. Child belted directly to backboard and/or cot in manner to prevent ramping or sliding in a front or rear end crash Loop narrow belt under each arm and extend over child 's shoulder securing belt at shoulder level so no gap exists above shoulder. Use soft, sliding, or breakaway connector to hold shoulder straps together on chest. Anchor 2 belts to non -sliding cot member and route over thighs and hips, not around waist. 5. Properly secure isolette and infant according to manufacturer 's guidelines. Rest harness securely on child with no blanket or sheet between harness and child. Attach to isolette tray at four points. Additional soft Velcro straps may be added for lateral security. Blanket or towels may be used to provide stabilization of the head. NON -PATIENT TRANSPORT Best practice is to transport well children in a vehicle other than the ambulance, whenever possible, for safety. If no other vehicle is available and circumstances dictate that the ambulance must transport a well child, he/she may be transported in the following locations: Captain 's chair in patient compartment using a size appropriate integrated seat or a convertible safety seat that is secured safely in relationship to the orientation of the captain 's chair. Passenger seat of the driver 's compartment if child is large enough (ac cording to manufacturer 's guidelines) to ride forward -facing in a child safety seat or booster seat. Airbag should be turned off. If the air bag can be deactivated, an infant, restrained in a rear-facing infant seat, may be placed in the passenger seat of the driver 's compartment. USE OF PATIENT 'S CHILD PASSENGER SAFETY SEAT AFTER INVOLVEMENT IN MOTOR VEHICLE CRASH The patient 's safety seat may be used to transport the child to the hospital after involvement in a minor crash if ALL of the following apply: It is a convertible seat with both front and rear belt paths. Visual inspection, including under movable seat padding, does not reveal cracks or deformation. Vehicle in which safety seat was installed was capable of being driven from the scene of the crash. Vehicle door nearest the child safety seat was undamaged. The air bags (if any) did not deploy. 20238.13 Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 2023Police Custody 8.14 PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to give EMS guidance for patients who are in police custody, restrained, and/or protective custody is required. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY Protective custody is a civil status in which an incapacitated person is detained by a law enforcement officer for the purposes of: (a) Assuring the safety of the individual or the public or both; and (b) Assisting the individual to return to a functional condition. For patients who present an immediate risk of serious injury to themselves or others, consult with law enforcement or a mental health professional about the use of protective custody to transport the patient to the Emergency Department for an emergency examination, after obtaining warrant from a Superior judge. ( 18 VSA \u00a77505 ) Patients who present with evidence of incapacitation from alcohol or drug use may be placed into protective custody and transported to the Emergency Department ( 18 VSA \u00a74810 ). POLICE CUSTODY Police custody means a person is under arrest. Patients in police custody who require medical care should be transported to a medical facility. DECISION TO TRANSPORT TO THE HOSPITAL If law enforcement refuses to place a patient into protective custody at the request of EMS, or if police and EMS disagree about whether a patient in police custody requires transport to a medical facility for further assessment or treatment, on -line Medical Direction must be contacted and a law enforcement supervisor should be requested for guidance. If Medical Direction advises that the patient needs to be transported to the Emergency Department but you are unable to do so, document circumstances carefully in your chart and communicate with Medical Direction. Patient medical condition is of primary concern when determining destination. When condition allows, consider law enforcement requests. EMS INITIATED RESTRAINTS For any patient potentially requiring restraints by EMS, reference Restraints - 6.4. POLICE RESTRAINT DEVICES Patients transported by EMS who have been restrained by law enforcement devices (e.g., handcuffs) should be accompanied, in the patient compartment, by a law enforcement officer who is capable of removing the device. If this is not feasible, the officer MUST follow directly behind the transporting ambulance to the receiving hospital. CONDUCTED ELECTRICAL WEAPONS Patients who have been subdued by a conducted electrical weapon (i.e., Taser ), reference Taser (Conducted Electrical Weapon) Probe Removal and Assessment - 6.5. PEPPER SPRAY Patients who have been subdued by pepper spray ( Eye & Dental Injuries - Adult & Pediatric 4.3 ). DELIRIUM WITH AGITATION Delirium with agitation is characterized by extreme restlessness, irritability, and/or high fever. Patients exhibiting these signs are at high risk for sudden death ( Restraints - 6.4).2013Refusal of Care Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. PURPOSE Establish guidelines for the management and documentation of situations where patients refuse treatment or transportation. REFUSAL OF CARE There are three components to a valid refusal of care. Absence of any of these components will most likely result in an invalid refusal. The three components are as follows: 1. Competence : In general, a patient who is an adult or a legally emancipated minor is considered legally competent to refuse care. A parent or legal guardian who is on - scene or available by phone, may refuse care on his or her minor children 's behalf. 2. Capacity : In order to refuse medical assistance a patient must have the capacity to understand the nature of his or her medical condition, the risks and benefits associated with the proposed treatment, and the risks associated with refusal of care. 3. Informed Refusal : A patient must be fully informed about his or her medical condition, the risks and benefits associated with the proposed treatment and the risks associated with refusing care. Patients who meet criteria to allow self -determination shall be allowed to make decisions regarding their medical care, including refusal of evaluation, treatment, or transport. These criteria include: 1. Adults ( 18 years of age or a legally emancipated minor). 2. Orientation to person, place, time, and situation. 3. No evidence of altered level of consciousness resulting from head trauma, medical illness, intoxication, dementia, psychiatric illness or other causes. 4. No evidence of impaired judgment from alcohol or drug influence. 5. No language communication barriers (reliable translation available, e.g., on -scene interpreter, language line). 6. No evidence or admission of suicidal ideation resulting in any gesture or attempt at self-harm. No verbal or written expression of suicidal ideation regardless of any apparent inability to complete a suicide. EMS providers will make every reasonable effort to convince reluctant patients to access medical care at the emergency department via the EMS system before accepting a Refusal of Care. Utilize the Patient Non -Transport Algorithm. Any check mark in a shaded area requires on -line Medical Direction prior to terminating the patient encounter. (Include blood glucose only if applicable.) 20238.15 Refusal of Care Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. Consider on -line Medical Direction for all patients who present a threat to themselves, present with an altered level of consciousness or diminished mental capacity, or have history or examination findings consistent with a high -risk refusal. Medical Direction is to be provided all relevant information and may need to speak directly with the patient by radio or preferably a recorded landline. If Medical Direction advises that the patient needs to be transported to the Emergency Department but you are unable to do so, document circumstances carefully in your chart and communicate with Medical Direction. If based on a complete patient assessment, the patient does not have the capacity to refuse care and is in need of medical treatment or protective custody and refuses care, contact law enforcement for assistance. Examples of high -risk refusals include but are not limited to: 1. Treated / resolved hypoglycemia. 2. Patient with obvious head trauma and taking anticoagulant medications. 3. Intoxicated patients. 4. Abnormal vital signs. 5. Treated / resolved narcotic overdose. 6. High risk mechanism of injuries ( Spinal Trauma & Assessment - 4.6). 7. Patient / witness reports suicidal ideations. 8. Possible apparent life -threatening event ( Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) - 2.6. PROCEDURE 1. Clearly offer the patient both treatment and transportation to the hospital and document the offer in your Patient Care Report (SIREN). All non-transports after patient contact require documentation in SIREN. 2. Perform an assessment of the patient 's mental capacity and, to the extent permitted by the patient, a physical exam including vital signs. Your assessment, or the patient 's refusal of care, must be fully documented in your Patient Care Report 3. Explain to the patient the nature and severity of his/her illness or injury, the treatments being proposed, the risks and consequences of accepting or refusing treatment, and the potential alternatives. Fully document the explanation given to the patient in your Patient Care Report. 4. A parent or legal guardian may refuse care for a minor or: When a parent or legal guardian is not reasonably available, another adult family member (e.g., grandparent), or other authorized representative having custody of the minor, may refuse care. EMS personnel may accept a telephonic refusal of care, provided that they have explained the consequences of refusing care; telephonic refusal of care should be carefully documented. 5. Follow the patient non -transport algorithm. Any check mark in a shaded area requires on -line Medical Direction prior to terminating the patient encounter. 6. Prepare and explain the Patient Non -Transport form or the equivalent section of the SIREN run form, if available, to the patient (or, in the case of a minor patient, the patient 's parent, legal guardian, or authorized representative). 7. The Patient Non -Transport form or SIREN screen should be signed by the patient (or, in the case of a minor patient, by the minor patient 's parent, legal guardian, or authorized representative) at the time of the refusal. The form should also be dated and, where possible, signed by a witness, preferably a competent relative, friend, police officer, or impartial third person. 8. If on -line Medical Direction was consulted for a refusal of care, obtain and document the physician 's name in the patient care report. 9. All patients in police custody retain the right to request transport. This should be coordinated with law enforcement. 10. If child abuse is suspected and a refusal of care situation exists, the EMT must contact police immediately ( Victims of Violence - 8.19). 11. Offer a naloxone leave behind kit to an At -Risk Person who is refusing transport. 20238.152013Refusal of Care Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

EMS agencies may assist Incident Management teams (fire departments, tactical teams, SAR, hazmat, police departments, etc.), in the provision of incident scene and training rehabilitation (Rehab) of personnel who are at risk of suffering adverse effects from stress or from exposure to heat, cold, or hazardous environments according to the following guidelines and in accordance with local fire/EMS/police department standard operating guidelines (SOGs) and the principles of the Incident Command System (ICS). EMS agencies that decide to participate in Rehab operations are encouraged to develop written agreements with fire or police departments or other agencies that clearly define operational roles in accordance with these guidelines. Personnel entering Rehab must be medically assessed for concerning signs or symptoms, including the following: Chest pain, altered mental status, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, syncope, heat stress, significant injury or other complaints. Personnel with concerning signs or symptoms should receive emergency medical care according to standard Vermont Statewide Emergency Medical Service Protocols. EMS personnel may perform the following activities in the Rehab area: Assess personnel for concerning signs or symptoms Obtain and report vital signs Obtain and report oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) and carboxyhemoglobin oximetry values Provide oral hydration with water or electrolyte -containing sport drinks Provide nutritional snacks or meals for longer duration events Provide passive and active cooling measures Compare measured vital signs to baseline records if available (baseline values established prior to the incident as part of comprehensive worker safety/health program. See NFPA 1582 / 1583 / 1584 . Any personnel encountered on the incident scene, including fire or police department members, that present with signs/symptoms of acute medical/traumatic illness or injury should receive emergency medical care by EMS personnel in accordance with the Vermont Statewide EMS Protocols. Treatments and assessments rendered using the Statewide EMS Protocols, which may include oxygen administration, IV fluid administration, medication administration, etc., should be part of a continuum of care that, as is true for the vast majority of EMS patients, results in transport to an appropriate acute care hospital. The decision to release an individual from Rehab is determined by the Incident Commander (IC) or delegate in command of the Rehab area. Decisions should ideally be made collaboratively with EMS staff on scene, but the ultimate responsibility for worker health and safety lies with the IC.Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

RESUSCITATION EFFORTS SHOULD BE WITHHELD UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES: Valid Do Not Resuscitate Order (Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) & Clinician Orders (COLST) - 8.7). Scene Safety : The physical environment is not safe for providers. Dead on Arrival (DOA) : A person is presumed dead on arrival when all five \"Signs of Death \" are present AND at least one associated \"Factor of Death \" is present. Signs of Death (All five signs of death must be present) Unresponsiveness Apnea Absence of palpable pulses at carotid, radial, and femoral sites Unresponsive pupils Absence of heart sounds Factors of Death (At least one associated factor of death must be present) Damage or destruction of the body incompatible with life, such as, but not limited to: Decapitation Decomposition Deforming brain injury Incineration or extensive full thickness burns Lividity/Rigor mortis of any degree Major blunt or penetrating trauma Body frozen solid \u2014unable to perform chest compressions SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED INFANT DEATH (SUID) An infant < 12 months who is apneic, asystolic (no heartbeat or umbilical cord pulse), and exhibiting lividity and/or rigor mortis may be presumed dead. NEONATE A neonate who is apneic, asystolic, and exhibits either neonatal maceration (softening or degeneration of the tissues after death in utero), or anencephaly (absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp), may be presumed dead. Contact Medical Direction if gestational age is less than 22 weeks and neonate shows signs of obvious immaturity (translucent and gelatinous skin, lack of fingernails, fused eyelids). Patients with ventricular assist devices (VAD) should almost never be pronounced dead at the scene ( Implantable Ventricular Assist Device P/ /Resuscitation Initiation and Termination8.17 2023Resuscitation Initiation and Termination Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.17 EA/EA/ PTERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION (TOR) RULE (ADULTS ONLY): 1) Arrest not witnessed by emergency medical services personnel. 2) NO return of spontaneous circulation after 20 minutes of either BLS alone or combined BLS and ALS in the absence of hypothermia. 3) No shock was delivered or advised by the AED. If ALL criteria are present, contact Medical Direction to consider termination of resuscitation. If ANY criteria are missing, contact Medical Direction to consider termination of resuscitation OR continued resuscitation and transport. If ROSC, continue resuscitation and transport AND contact Medical Direction . Notify law enforcement if terminating resuscitation. RESUSCITATION MAY BE STOPPED UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES : When the patient regains pulse/respirations ( Post Resuscitative Care - 3.4A, Post Resuscitative Care - 3.4P, Cardiac Arrest - 3.2A or Cardiac Arrest - 3.2P). The physical environment becomes unsafe for providers. The exhaustion of EMS providers. Consider early transport if unable to ventilate. Contact Medical Direction to consider Termination of Resuscitation for any of the following: o Arrest witnessed by EMS personnel, if patient has NO return of spontaneous circulation after 20 minutes of either BLS alone or combined BLS and ALS in the absence of hypothermia, AND no shocks were delivered or advised, OR o Extrication is prolonged (> 20 minutes) with no resuscitation possible during extrication (hypothermia is an exception), OR o If extenuating circumstances or questions Hypothermic patients without contraindications to CPR should have continued CPR and should not be considered for TOR until the core temperature has been rewarmed to 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0F) with no return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (Hypothermia (Environmental) - Adult & Pediatric 2.13 ). CPR -induced consciousness is also a contraindication of TOR. Cardiac arrests should generally be managed on scene until return of spontaneous circulation, decision to cease resuscitation, or criteria are met for transport to hospital as indicated by Termination of Resuscitation (TOR) Rule. If transport is initiated, resuscitation must be continued until arrival at the receiving hospital. May continue resuscitation and transport if conditions on scene are NOT amenable to cessation of resuscitation. The adult TOR rule does not apply to pediatric patients < 18 years old . Contact Medical Direction to consider termination of resuscitation or continued resuscitation and transport of pediatric patients. Contact Medical Direction to consider Termination of Resuscitation for the n on- hypothermic patient unresponsive to advanced cardiac life support with a non - shockable rhythm after 20 minutes of resuscitation and ETCO 2 10 mmHg. For narrow -complex PEA with a rate above 40 or refractory and recurrent ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia, consider continuation of resuscitation and transport: o May consider termination of resuscitation if > 60 minutes from time of dispatch o Confirm cardiac standstill with point -of-care ultrasound, if available and trainedPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERSEMT/ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS - ADULT Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. DETERMINING DEATH IN THE FIELD When efforts to resuscitate are not initiated or are terminated under the above provisions, EMS providers shall: Document time that death is pronounced. Notify law enforcement, who will alert Medical Examiner. Consider possibility of a crime scene and restrict access. Any decision to move the body must be made in collaboration with law enforcement and the medical examiner. Leave any resuscitation adjuncts such as advanced airway devices, IV/IO access devices, electrode pads, etc., in place. Inform family on scene of patient 's death and offer to contact family, friends, clergy, or other support systems. The above requirements apply to situations in which law enforcement or the medical examiner may take jurisdiction. Law enforcement and the medical examiner are not required to take jurisdiction of hospice or other patients who are known to have been terminally ill from natural causes or congenital anomaly, and death was imminent and expected. Where law enforcement is not involved, EMS providers may provide appropriate assistance to families or other caregivers. MASS CASUALTY INCIDENT (MCI) Mass/Multiple Casualty Triage - 9.1. TRAUMATIC CARDIAC ARREST See Traumatic Cardiac Arrest - 4.11. DOCUMENTATION Complete a patient care record (SIREN) in all cases. If available, include ECG rhythm strips and code summary with the patient care report. Document special orders including DNR, on -line Medical Direction, etc. MCI conditions may require a triage tag in addition to an abbreviated PCR. Record any special circumstances or events that might impact patient care or forensic issues. 20238.17 Prolonging resuscitation efforts, beyond 20 minutes, without a return of spontaneous circulation is usually futile, unless cardiac arrest is compounded by hypothermia or submersion in cold water. EMS providers are not required to transport every victim of cardiac arrest to a hospital. Unless special circumstances are present, it is expected that most resuscitations will be performed on - scene until the return of spontaneous circulation or a decision to cease resuscitation efforts is made based on the criteria listed. Transportation with continuing CPR is justified if hypothermia is present or suspected. Current AHA guidelines state: \"cessation of efforts in the out -of-hospital setting ...should be standard practice. \" An ETCO 2 level of 10 mmHg or less measured 20 minutes after the initiation of advanced cardiac life support accurately predicts death in patients with cardiac arrest.E A P/ /E A P/ /Resuscitation Initiation and Termination 8.17Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

Consider traffic flow in the following response situations: o When access to the scene will be delayed, such as calls requiring EMS to stage for law enforcement but EMS is closer to the scene o Hazardous road conditions limiting response speed and/or road conditions are likely to cause accidents for individuals pulling to side of road (e.g., severe icing of road ways or extreme limited visibility ) Determine transport priority considering the road and traffic conditions as they may impact the potential time savings, the ability to perform effective patient care, and most importantly the driver 's ability to safely transport with lights and sirens: o Consider flow of traffic transport for cases such as cardiac arrest due to the inability of providers to be properly restrained when performing CPR, unless traffic conditions would significantly prolong transport time o Consider reserving use of lights and sirens in transport to known time -sensitive conditions such as MI, stroke or multi -trauma SAFETY WHEN IN MOTION While ambulance is in motion (at all times, not only while transporting patients): All objects weighing 3 lbs or greater should be secured within a cabinet, compartment or safely attached to a permanently -affixed structure within the passenger compartment or cab. Patients should be secured to the stretcher with all available belts -- i.e. chest/shoulder harness, lap and leg belts . Do not leave belts unused. This includes patients who are secured to backboards . Providers should be restrained at all possible times , unless it would interfere with patient care: o If belt prohibits patient care from being performed , it may be removed but then should be refastened as soon as possible o If belt must be removed for care, consider timing procedures/treatments to times ambulance will experience minimal braking or turns . Select straight sections of road with few intersections to reduce risk of being thrown during sudden braking or turnin g Family members/non -rescue personnel should be properly restrained at all times . SEXUAL ASSAULT DEFINITION Any sexual contact or behavior that occurs without consent. This can include rape, unwanted sexual touching, and forced or coerced performance of a sex act. PROCEDURE FOR ASSESSMENT Stabilize life threatening injuries. If necessary, to remove patient 's clothing, cut along seam lines to preserve evidence. General medical care is a priority. Do not examine the genitals or rectum unless necessary to stabilize the patient. Dress wounds, but do not attempt to clean. Discourage showering, changing clothes, brushing teeth, eating, drinking, or using the bathroom to preserve evidence. Assess and document injuries. Obtain a brief history of the assault and the timeframe. Do not attempt to get a detailed description of event. Document patient appearance - torn, bloody, missing clothing. Whenever possible, secure clothing in a paper bag and bring to the ED. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Provide calm, compassionate, non -judgmental support. Use active listening and non -blaming language. Explain all your actions to the patient and obtain consent for all treatment. Always wear gloves to preserve evidence. Consider drug facilitated sexual assault if patient has gaps in memory. Consider human trafficking if the patient is altered, unaware of their location (see human trafficking guidelines). Communicate with the receiving hospital early so that a forensic nurse and advocate can be contacted. Document verbatim any patient statement regarding the assault.Victims of Violence Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

It can include physical, emotional, psychological and sexual abuse, secondary exposure to domestic violence and torture. Child maltreatment occurs across all age groups, sexes, cultures and socioeconomic groups. Missed diagnosis can lead to repeat abuse and/or escalation of injuries. Approximately one third of victims are younger than 3 months. Children younger than three years of age are at highest risk for fatality. Child: an individual under the age of 18. Person responsible for a child 's welfare: includes the child 's parents, guardian, foster parent; any other adult who resides in a child 's home who serves in a parental role; an employee of a public or private residential home, institution or agency; or other person responsible for the child's welfare while in a residential, educational, or child care setting, including any staff person . Vermont law (33.V.S.A . \u00a7 4912 ) defines an abused or neglected child as one whose physical health, psychological growth and development or welfare is harmed or is at substantial risk of harm by the acts or omissions of his or her parent or other person responsible for the child 's welfare. An abused or neglected child also means a child who is sexually abused or at substantial risk of sexual abuse by any person.

PROCEDURE FOR ASSESSMENT Stabilize life -threatening injuries. Treat and document assessment findings using appropriate medical treatment protocols - general medical care is a priority. Assess and document injuries and the patient 's physical appearance. Victims of Violence Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20238.19 Obtain a brief history of the presenting concern with a timeframe. Document using the patient 's own words verbatim. Assess privately in a safe place, if feasible. Incorporate strategies to reduce communication barriers (speak clearly, slowly, use short instructions). Note psychological /behavioral characteristics of maltreatment including (but not limited to): excessive crying, passivity or aggression, depression; compliant or fearful behavior for safety of self, children, and/or pets: panic attacks, anxiety, depression and/or suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. Assess for physical signs of maltreatment, including but not limited to: o Sexual assault, strangulation, defensive injuries o Unexplained or poorly explained bruising, lacerations, or fractures o Multiple injuries in various stages of healing o Alterations in skin integrity, including decubitus ulcers o Hazardous living conditions o Inappropriate clothing for weather o Inadequate hygiene o Physical signs of malnutrition or dehydration o Physical signs of under/over medication o Pregnancy or presence of sexually transmitted disease Assess for historical signs of maltreatment, including but not limited to: o Delayed presentation for medical care o Discrepancy between stated history and clinical presentation or observed injuries o Absence of caregiver(s) o Failure to respond to warning signs of obvious disease o A disclosure of maltreatment by the patient o Patient confined to restricted space or position o Repetitive EMS calls due to probable failure of health care surveillance SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Interactions with elder or vulnerable adult patients are a powerful step in the healing process. Provide calm, compassionate, non -judgmental care in a reassuring manner. Written documentation is vital to comprehensive, accurate investigations. Mandated Reporting Responsibilities: Vermont law requires any and all cases of suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation of an elder or vulnerable adult must be reported immediately and/or within 48 hours: o Notify the Vermont Adult Protective Services Program at 800 -564-1612 between the work hours of 8:00am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday o After business hours, on weekends or holidays, call the Emergency Services Program (ESP) at 800 -649-5285 o If a caregiver refuses treatment of an elder/vulnerable adult whom you feel needs medical attention, contact law enforcement immediately o Informing hospital personnel or involving law enforcement does not fulfill legal reporting responsibilities o Responsibility for reporting elder/ vulnerable adult maltreatment and protection from liability for such good faith reporting is established by 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 6902 (Mandated Reporter)Hazardous Materials Exposure Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. PURPOSE The goal of the hazardous materials exposure protocol is to prepare the EMS provider for the potential risks that may be encountered and to provide guidelines to mitigate the effects of a hazardous exposure incident. The EMS provider may reference additional protocols for the management of specific hazardous materials exposure in dealing with known chemicals. Successful management of a hazardous materials exposure depends on effective coordination between EMS, local hazardous materials teams, fire and police departments, the Poison Control Center, and appropriate state and federal agencies. IDENTIFICATION Identification of the exposed material should be made at the earliest convenient time possible. Proper chemical name and spelling will be necessary for identification of procedures for Poison Control (1 -800-222-1222) and receiving hospitals. Consider contacting Poison Control as soon as practical for consultation. Utilization of shipping papers, waybills, and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) may assist in identifying chemical hazards, safety precautions, personal protective equipment, and treatments. Note: Many household chemicals may not require activation of a hazardous materials team. Utilize manufacturer 's recommendation for decontamination and treatment, or contact Poison Control for treatment and decontamination procedures. PERSONAL SAFETY Personal protection is the highest priority when responding to an incident where hazardous material exposure is suspected. DO NOT ENTER THE HOT ZONE. Only HazMat Teams should enter the hot zone. If there is a major hazardous materials release: o Request specific staging information and be alert for clusters of injured patients o Maintain safe location upwind and uphill of the site (at least 300 ft) o Observe strict adherence to hot, warm, and cold -zone areas for personal safety, decontamination, and treatment o Activate the Vermont Hazardous Materials Response Team HAZMAT Hotline at 800 -641- 5005 or through 911 PATIENT DECONTAMINATION Only properly trained and protected personnel should conduct patient decontamination. The decontamination system is established by the appropriately trained fire department/HazMat Team. EMS personnel will work cooperatively with them during the decontamination process. Patient decontamination is necessary to minimize injury due to exposure, as well as to mitigate risk of secondary exposure. MASS/GROSS DECONTAMINATION Mass Decontamination (Large -scale Multiple/Mass Casualty) involves the effective dilution of a chemical or hazardous substance utilizing large quantities of water. This process should be supervised by the appropriately trained local fire department or HazMat Team. This process is necessary due to the involvement of an overwhelming number of patients, the severity of symptoms, and where technical or fine decontamination cannot be utilized due to time and personnel. 20239.0Hazardous Materials Exposure Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. TECHNICAL DECONTAMINATION Technical Decontamination involves a multi -step process, supervised by the appropriately trained fire department or HazMat Team. This decontamination process is dependent on the type of chemical hazard present, and may require different methods such as: o Dilution o Absorption o Neutralization o Chemical degradation o Solidification Each method of decontamination has specific uses. Ascertain from the HazMat Team which method was used, if there are any hazards associated with the decontamination process, and if further definitive decontamination is required at the hospital. DEFINITIVE/FINE DECONTAMINATION Usually completed at the hospital, it involves additional washing and rinsing to further dilute and finally remove any contaminants. Definitive decontamination should be performed in an authorized decontamination facility and with appropriately trained personnel. DECONTAMINATION OF SPECIAL POPULATIONS Children and their families, the elderly/frail, and patients with medical appliances will require more EMS personnel and time for general assistance and may also require simultaneous basic life support assistance during decontamination. An individual patient requiring special needs decontamination may take 10 - 15 minutes to complete. Although the principles of decontamination are the same, certain precautions may need to be taken, depend ing on the patient. These patients may have the inability to give history or describe symptoms and physical complaints. Typical stress response of children is to be highly anxious and inconsolable, making assessment difficult. Small children are more difficult to handle while wearing personal protection equipment (PPE). Attempt to keep children with their families, as the decontamination process is likely to be frightening and children may resist. Keep patients with existing medical conditions together with their caregivers, if feasible. Children and elderly, and possibly special needs patients, are inherently unable to maintain body temperature and quickly become hypothermic. Utilize water warmed to 100\u00baF, if available. Keep warm after drying procedure. Use low -pressure water and soft washcloths and protect the airway and eyes throughout the decontamination process. 20239.0Hazardous Materials Exposure Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. TREATMENT DURING DECONTAMINATION If medication is required, limit administration route to intramuscular or medi -inhaler. Intravenous therapy and advanced airway interventions should be delayed until after gross decontamination. Specific individual treatment should be referenced from Poison Control or MSDS sheets. DOCUMENT EXPOSURE AND TREATMENT INFORMATION Name of chemical(s). Amount, time, and route of exposure. Decontamination information. Treatment/antidotes administered. TRANSPORT EMS personnel transporting potentially contaminated patients (e.g., patients who have received gross decontamination) must have appropriate PPE. If an ambulance has transported a contaminated patient, it can only be used to transport similarly contaminated patients until proper decontamination of the vehicle is complete. Contaminated patients will not be transported by helicopter. Lining of the interior of the ambulance and further use of PPE may be necessary, dependent upon the level of completed decontamination. Communication of chemical exposure should be transmitted to the receiving hospital at the earliest possible time. Transmitted information should include such information as covered under the documentation and treatment section. 20239.0 MASS/MULTIPLE CASUALTY TRIAGE Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. PURPOSE The goal of the mass/multiple Casualty Triage protocol is to prepare for a unified, coordinated, and immediate EMS mutual aid response by prehospital and hospital agencies to effectively expedite the emergency management of the victims of any type of Mass Casualty Incident (MCI). Successful management of any MCI depends upon the effective cooperation, organization, and planning among health care professionals, hospital administrators and out -of-hospital EMS agencies, state and local government representatives, and individuals and/or organizations associated with disaster -related support agencies. Adoption of Model Uniform Core Criteria (MUCC). DEFINITIONS Multiple Casualty Situations The number of patients and the severity of the injuries do not exceed the ability of the provider to render care. Patients with life -threatening injuries are treated first. Mass Casualty Incidents The number of patients and the severity of the injuries exceed the capability of the provider, and patients sustaining major injuries who have the greatest chance of survival with the least expenditure of time, equipment, supplies, and personnel are managed first. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Initial assessment to include the following: Location of incident. Type of incident. Any hazards. Approximate number of victims. Type of assistance required. COMMUNICATION Within the scope of a Mass Casualty Incident, the EMS provider may, within the limits of their scope of practice, perform necessary ALS procedures, that under normal circumstances would require a direct physician 's order. These procedures shall be the minimum necessary to prevent the loss of life or the critical deterioration of a patient 's condition. All procedures performed under this order shall be documented thoroughly. Communications Policy - 8.3 or Communications Failure Policy - 8.4. TRIAGE Utilize a triage system such as \"SALT \" (Sort, Assess, Lifesaving Interventions, Treatment/ Transport) to prioritize patients. SALT is part of a CDC -sponsored project based upon best evidence and designed to develop a national standard for mass casualty triage. Assess each patient as quickly and safely as possible. Conduct rapid assessment. Assign patients to broad categories based on need for treatment (Still, Wave, Walk). Remember: Triage is not treatment! Stopping to provide care to one patient will only delay care for others. Standard triage care is only to correct airway and severe bleeding problems. 20239.1MASS/MULTIPLE CASUALTY TRIAGE Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. TRIAGE CATEGORIES Immediate: Serious injuries, immediately life -threatening problems, high potential for survival (e.g., tension pneumothorax, exposure to nerve agent resulting in severe shortness of breath or seizures). Likely to survive given available resources. If no to any of the following: Has a peripheral pulse? Not in respiratory distress? Hemorrhage is controlled? Follows commands or makes purposeful movements? Delayed : Serious (not minor) injuries requiring care but management can be delayed without increasing morbidity or mortality (e.g., long bone fractures, 40% BSA exposure to mustard gas). If yes to all of the following: Has a peripheral pulse? Not in respiratory distress? Hemorrhage is controlled? Follows commands or makes purposeful movements? Minimal: Injuries require minor care or no care (e.g., abrasions, minor lacerations, nerve agent exposure with mild runny nose). If yes to all of the following: Has a peripheral pulse? Not in respiratory distress? Hemorrhage is controlled? Follows commands or makes purposeful movements? Expectant: Unlikely to survive given available resources. Does not mean dead. Method of preserving resources: should receive comfort care or resuscitation when resources are available. Serious injuries: very poor survivability even with maximal care in hospital or pre -hospital setting (e.g., 90% body surface area burn, multiple trauma with exposed brain matter). If no to any of the following: Has a peripheral pulse? Not in respiratory distress? Hemorrhage is controlled? Follows commands or makes purposeful movements? Dead : Patient is not breathing after opening airway. (In children, if after giving 2 rescue breaths, if appropriate.) Deceased or casualties whose injuries are so severe that their chance of survival does not justify expenditure of limited resources. Tag patients to prevent re -triage. Do not move bodies unless they are hindering efforts to rescue live patients, or they are in danger of being further damaged, for example, burned by fire, building collapse, etc. TAGGING SYSTEM Use water -repellent triage tags with waterproof markers and attach to the patient. Indicate patient 's triage priority, degree of decontamination performed, treatment and medications received. TRIAGE IN HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INCIDENTS Decontamination The need for decontamination is the \"first triage decision. \" since decontamination can be a lengthy process; the \"second decision \" is which patient(s) are the first to be decontaminated. The \"third decision \" is based on need for treatment during the decontamination process, since only simple procedures such as antidote ad ministration can be accomplished while wearing PPE. Identification and Treatment Signs and symptoms of exposure will usually dictate the treatment required, however, at the earliest possible time, identification of the specific chemical should be made. Reference additional hazardous materials protocols as necessary. Request additional resources. Initial antidote and medical supplies may be limited to priority patients. Respiratory compromise is a leading factor of fatalities due to hazardous material exposure. Symptoms of chemical exposure may be delayed and occur suddenly. Constant reevaluation of respiratory status is necessary. 2023RED YELLOW GREEN BLACK9.1 GREYMASS/MULTIPLE CASUALTY TRIAGE Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication. These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 20239.1 SALT Mass Casualty Triage Remove the patient from scene and decontaminate by appropriately trained personnel. If triage is required for a mass casualty event, use the following guidelines: o If vomiting starts: Within 1 hour of exposure, survival is unlikely and patient should be tagged \"Expectant \" Less than 4 hours after exposure, patient needs immediate decontamination and evaluation and should be tagged \"Immediate \" 4 hours after exposure, reevaluation can be delayed 24 - 72 hours if no other injury is present and patient should be tagged \"Minimal \" Routine Patient Care. Treat traumatic injuries and underlying medical conditions. Patients with residual contamination risk from wounds, shrapnel, or internal contamination should be wrapped in water repellent dressings to reduce cross contamination. Consider Air Medical Transport after proven definitive decontamination of patient. 2013PEMT/ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERSEA/EA/Radiation Injuries Adult & Pediatric Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

These protocols MAY NOT BE altered or modified. E A P/ /E A P/ /INITIAL ASSESSMENT Given the community spread of COVID -19, EMS practitioners who will have close contact (less than 6') with any potential emergency medical patient should don appropriate PPE as described below. If dispatch advises that the patient is suspected of having an infectious disease (COVID -19), EMS practitioners should put on appropriate PPE (see below) before entering the scene. If situation is unclear, or cardiac or respiratory arrest, use full PPE (see below). EMS practitioners should evaluate for and suspect the patient may have COVID - 19 if any of the following signs and symptoms are present: o Patients presenting with fever, or cough, or shortness of breath, OR o Anyone who has had close contact with someone being monitored for or diagnosed with COVID -19 within 14 days of symptom onset, OR o A history of travel from outside the United States within 14 days of symptom onset. Initial assessment should begin from at least 6 feet from the patient and be limited to one EMS practitioner, if possible. A face mask should be worn by the patient for source control. If a nasal cannula is in place, a face mask should be worn over the nasal cannula. If a non - rebreather mask is clinically indicated, place a face mask over it. Any additional resources requested (transporting agency, intercepting agency, fire, police) should be notified so they can take precautions. Refer to the COVID -19 Field Triage Guidance to determine if the patient requires transport to the Emergency Department. 2023PURPOSE To minimize risk of exposure and spread of Coronavirus (COVID -19). . PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) RECOMMENDATIONS Responders who will have close contact (less than 6 feet) with any potential emergency medical patient should don the following personal protective equipment before making contact: o Face mask (definition: surgical mask N95 mask \"): Fit-tested N95 respirators that offer a higher level of protection should be used instead of a face mask when in the presence of a confirmed COVID - 19 case or when performing or present for an aerosol -generating procedure o Eye protection (i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face). Personal eyeglasses and contact lenses are NOT considered adequate eye protection o A single pair of disposable patient examination gloves. Change gloves if they become torn or heavily contaminated o Isolation gown Prioritize gowns for aerosol -generating procedures, care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, and high -contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of EMS clinicians (e.g., moving patient onto a stretcher) Drivers should wear PPE if providing patient care.

If experiencing supply chain interruptions, consider CDC guidance to reuse N -95 respirators: oThe CDC recommends re -use of an N -95 respirator up to five times unless the manufacturer has more specific reuse recommendations. oN95 respirators used during aerosol generating procedures or respirators that have been contaminated with blood, respiratory or nasal secretions, or other bodily fluids from patients should be immediately discarded and not reused. oIf a respirator is removed between uses, it should be hung in a designated storage area or kept in a clean, breathable container such as a paper bag between uses. To minimize potential cross -contamination, store respirators so that they do not touch each other and the person using the respirator is clearly identified. Storage containers should be disposed of or cleaned regularly. The outside surfaces of a used N -95 respirator should be considered contaminated. Consider the following steps in the donning process to prevent cross contamination: oAlways use clean gloves when inspecting, handling, donning, and performing a user seal check on a reused respirator. oAvoid touching the inside of the respirator. oPrior to reusing, inspect the integrity of the respirator, checking for obvious signs of damage. oDiscard gloves after the N95 respirator is donned and any adjustments are made to ensure the respirator is sitting comfortably on your face with a good seal. oClean hands with soap and water or an alcohol -based hand sanitizer after touching or adjusting the respirator. oThe CDC recommends using a cleanable face shield (preferred) or a surgical mask over an N95 respirator and/or other steps (e.g., masking patients, use of engineering controls), when feasible to reduce surface contamination of the re -used respirator.

If possible, consult with Medical Direction before performing aerosol - generating procedures. Practitioners should wear N95 respirator/PAPR, gown, gloves and face shield or goggles. EMS practitioners should exercise caution if an aerosol -generating procedure (e.g., bag valve mask (BVM) ventilation, oropharyngeal endotracheal intubation, nebulizer treatment, resuscitation involving emergency intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is necessary). BVMs, and other ventilatory equipment, should be equipped with HEPA filtration to filter expired air. If possible, the rear doors of the ambulance should be opened, and the HVAC system should be activated during aerosol -generating procedures. Consider use of MDI (metered dose endotracheal intubation. o Supraglottic airways (SGA): Please note that use of a SGA (King or i -Gel) is considered a high -risk aerosolizing procedure. It is critically important to plug the side/gastric port on a SGA to prevent large volume spread of airborne pathogens TRANSPORT EMS practitioners should notify the receiving healthcare facility if they suspect COVID -19 so that appropriate precautions may be taken prior to arrival. Share any known details regarding signs/symptoms, travel, or contact history. During transport, limit the number of practitioners in the patient compartment to essential personnel to minimize possible exposures. Keep the patient separated from other people as much as possible. Family members and other contacts of suspect patients should not ride in the ambulance. If unavoidable, they should wear a face mask. Isolate the ambulance driver from the patient: o Close the door/window between these compartments before bringing the patient on board Tape opening with plastic if there is no door or window that can close Use non -recirculated mode to ventilate ambulance. Open the outside air vents in the driver area and turn on the rear exhaust ventilation fans to the highest setting. Follow hospital protocol for transfer of patient.

A.3 E A P/ /E A P/ /PPE Continued : o If during initial patient contact and assessment and before an EMS provider has donned the appropriate PPE, it becomes apparent that the patient is a suspected case of Ebola, the EMS provider must immediately remove themselves from the area and assess whether an exposure occurred. The provider should implement their agency 's exposure plan, if indicated by assessment. o EMS personnel wearing PPE who have cared for the patient must remain in the back of the ambulance and not be the driver. GENERAL GUIDENCE Keep the patient separated from other persons as much as possible. Minimize the number of EMS personnel that directly care for the patient as appropriate depending on the condition of the patient and scene. Consider obtaining additional resources or mutual aid to ensure adequate staffing and PPE. Recommended crew includes 2 patient care providers, and one driver. Use caution when approaching a patient with Ebola. Illness can cause delirium, with erratic behavior that can place EMS personnel at risk of infection, e.g., flailing, staggering. Initiate transport to the closest facility. Consider transport directly to UVMMC or DHMC if additional transport time < 15 minutes. Contact Medical Direction for guidance. Notify the receiving hospital before transport and notify the VT Department of Health at 802-863-7240. Patients being monitored by VT Department of Health who develop symptoms and inter - facility transfers will be transported by designated ground units (UVM Healthnet Transport, DHART). Keep an accurate list of all EMS personnel involved in care of a suspect patient. If blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions from a patient with suspected Ebola come into direct contact with the EMS provider 's skin or mucous membranes, then the EMS provider should disengage when safe to do so. They should wash the affected skin surfaces with soap and water and mucous membranes (e.g., conjunctiva) should be irrigated with a large amount of water or eyewash solution. Report exposure to an occupational health provider or supervisor for follow -up and receive medical evaluation. Follow CDC guidelines for cleaning EMS transport vehicles after transporting a patient with suspected or confirmed Ebola. EMS personnel involved in care of a suspect or known Ebola case must follow up with VDH to determine appropriate monitoring, follow -up and reporting requirements. Contact the Vermont Department of Health 802 -863-7240 and Medical Direction for guidance for patients that refuse transport or are deceased on scene. MEDICAL CARE GUIDANCE If patient is cooperative and able to assist, request the patient put on a Tyvek coverall. If the patient cannot tolerate the Tyvek coverall, or the coverall is likely to interfere with patient care activities, or the patient cannot assist in putting it on, the patient may be wrapped in a sheet or similar barrier to prevent environmental contamination. Limit activities, especially during transport that can increase the risk of exposure to infectious material. Limit aerosol -generating procedures such as nebulized medications, CPAP, intubation or suctioning unless absolutely necessary for patient care. Limit the use of needles and other sharps as much as possible. IVs should not be started unless the patient is in emergent need of volume replacement or IV medications. No sharps are to be utilized in a moving vehicle. All needles and sharps should be handled with extreme care and disposed of in puncture -proof, sealed containers. Consider giving the patient oral medicine to reduce nausea. See Nausea/Vomiting Protocol - Adult & Pediatric 2.14 . If patient is vomiting, give them a large red biohazard bag to contain any emesis.

See http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/clinicians/emergency -services/ 2023EMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS - ADULT & PEDIATRIC BACKGROUND Measles typically presents in adults and children as an acute, viral illness characterized by fever and a generalized maculopapular rash (small, red, flat or raised bumps). The early signs may include cough, conjunctivitis, and runny nose. Koplik spots - blue-white spots on the mucosal tissue of the mouth and gums - are occasionally seen. The rash usually starts on the face, proceeds down the body, and may include the palms and soles. The rash, which lasts for several days, initially appears discrete, but may become confluent before fading in order of appearance. The time between exposure and rash onset averages 14 days but may range from 7 to 21 days. Of note, immunocompromised patients may not develop the rash. Complications include diarrhea, otitis media, pneumonia, hepatitis, and encephalitis. Measles is transmitted by airborne particles, droplets, and direct contact with the respiratory secretions of an infected person. Patients are considered to be contagious for a total of nine days - from 4 days before through 4 days after the rash appears with date of rash onset counting as day 0. PURPOSE There have been an increased number of measles cases and multiple outbreaks in the U.S. These guidelines address precautions that should be taken by EMS personnel when evaluating and transporting persons with suspected measles infection. PROCEDURE In addition to routine infection prevention practices including standard precautions, VT EMS recommends the following: 1. Vaccination All EMS personnel should have documented evidence of immunity to measles. Entities responsible for EMS providers may want to review their current policies regarding documentation of immunity for staff, including volunteers. This information should be documented and readily available at the work location. Presumptive evidence of immunity to measles for EMS providers includes 2 doses of MMR vaccine or laboratory evidence of immunity (measles IgG positive). First responders born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence (e.g., blood test) of immunity or laboratory confirmation of previous disease should be vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval. 2. Protective Equipment and Procedures All EMS personnel should use standard, droplet, and airborne precautions during all encounters with patients suspected to have measles. Measles is a highly contagious viral infection. In order to minimize risk, the following is recommended: o Only those who are known to be immune should approach patients who may have measles o EMS personnel should wear an N -95 particulate respirator or a respirator with similar effectiveness in preventing airborne transmission; please note that particulate respirators should only be used as part of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes appropriate screening, training and fit -testing; patients should wear a surgical mask, if they are able to tolerate it safelyHigh Consequence Pathogen Measles Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.

These protocols, policies, or procedures MAY NOT BE altered or modified. 2023A.3 E A P/ /E A P/ /3. Notification to Receiving Facility Receiving facilities must be notified PRIOR to arrival of known or suspected measles patients to facilitate implementation of appropriate infection prevention procedures. In health care settings, patients with suspected measles should be placed immediately in an airborne infection (negative -pressure) isolation room if one is available and, if possible, should not be sent to other parts of the hospital for examination or testing purposes. 4. Transportation Because measles virus can contaminate surfaces or hang in the air for up to two hours, ambulances and transport vhicles should be taken out of service for two hours after transport of a patient with known or suspected measles. Routine cleaning of the transport vehicle should be done. 5. Report and Evaluation of Exposure Make note of all EMS personnel who were potentially exposed to measles during the time the suspect measles patient was being treated by EMS and for up to 2 hours after. If measles is confirmed in the suspect patient, exposed people will need to be assessed for measles immunity: o EMS personnel who are potentially exposed to measles should consult with health care and public health professionals o Health care personnel should evaluate risk and recommend and/or provide appropriate post -exposure prophylaxis when indicated (i.e., one dose of MMR within 72 hours of exposure for first responders with no proof of immunity) o In consultation with the Health Department, first responders who are exposed and do not have proof of immunity may be furloughed from day 5 through day 21 following exposure o Personnel who develop symptoms consistent with measles, including fever, rash, runny nose, cough and red, watery eyes, should seek medical attention (calling ahead before going to the medical facility so proper precautions can be taken to reduce potential exposure) o All suspected cases of measles must be reported immediately to the Health Department at 802 -863-7240 (available 24/7)Vermont EMS has taken extreme caution to ensure all information is accurate and in accordance with professional standards in effect at the time of publication.
