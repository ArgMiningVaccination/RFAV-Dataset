In addition to this, similar services are also provided to the expatriates visiting or living in our country. The Ministry's Headquarters is situated at 88 Amy Street, Toorak, Suva with three divisional offices: - Northern Health Services - Ro Qomate house, Hospital Road, Labasa - Western Health Services - Vidilo House, Lautoka - Central Eastern Health Services - Tamavua, Suva The Ministry is responsible for providing a wide range of equitable, efficient, affordable, and vibrant Health services through our health facilities in all the medical sub-divisions of Fiji. Together with this, our mobile medical outreach teams also take various health services to remote, rural, and maritime locations. We envision making health services available to all the people of Fiji and leaving no one behind as we strive to uphold the United Nations' vision of Universal Health Coverage. Through this website, we aspire to bridge the information gap and strengthen our service deliveries between the Ministry and its stakeholders and lessees that we serve. COVID-19 Important Guidelines ADVISORY: FIJI REMOVES REMAINING COVID-19 RELATED BORDER HEALTH MEASURES - INCLUDING PROOF OF VACCINATION [Effective 14 February 2023, international travellers to Fiji will no longer be required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination and travel insurance.](https://mcttt.gov.fj/fiji-entry-conditions/) This move comes following careful consideration of the global and national COVID-19 situation by the COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Taskforce (CRMT) and applies to both arrivals from air and sea. Previously, all travellers 16 years and above were required to produce proof of full vaccination and travel insurance covering COVID-19. As reported by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS), Fiji's hospitalisation is low, owed to our community-wide immunisation and in-country surveillance capacity. Notably, the focus remains on implementing COVID safe measures around those vulnerable to the severe effects of COVID-19. Therefore, consistent with the experience in other countries with high vaccination rates, Fiji will no longer have any COVID-19 related border health measures. Fiji's Border Authorities will continue to review border health measures and maintain community surveillance for early warning of future threats while fostering socio-economic recovery. Fiji's economic recovery continues on the back of a strong tourism rebound. In 2022, visitor arrivals to Fiji reached 71.1 percent of 2019 levels (636,312) with a strong forecast for the first quarter of 2022. Public Advisory There is expected to be some immune escape capability that makes the variant more transmissible. The elderly, those with chronic diseases, pregnant mothers, and children with disabilities must be closely watched. That said, the booster would still be important for people at the highest risk of getting severe disease. This includes those ages 65 and older and those who are immunocompromised. Even small, additional increases in antibody production are critically important for them. We emphasize the point that strengthening our ability to live with COVID means we remain vigilant, maintain community-wide adoption of COVID safe measures where appropriate, and keep the impetus for immunisation. This is the only means to reduce the disease spread and protect those in the community who are less able to fend for themselves. There are several reasons it's important to avoid getting COVID-19. Getting infected puts you at risk of severe illness, potential hospitalization, and death, especially if you are high-risk and unvaccinated. COVID-19 is unlikely to go away completely. There are still many unknown variables. Virologists wonder whether it will behave like other coronaviruses - many of which cause the common cold. It may end up reappearing seasonally, as most of our viruses do. Hopefully, this will equate to an endemic instead of a pandemic. [Endemic](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/epidemic-endemic-pandemic-what-are-differences) is a disease that is still around but at a more manageable level, without causing spikes in deaths, for example. Instead, the disease is more manageable in terms of not overwhelming the system. The hope is that if COVID-19 is not eliminated, it would become more like the common cold. Also, anyone who falls sick should not be attending work or school, especially if they have COVID-19-like symptoms. You must get tested for COVID-19; 5-day isolation is recommended if you have tested positive. "}
