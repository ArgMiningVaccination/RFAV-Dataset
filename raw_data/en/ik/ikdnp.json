Published February 19, 2016 [This content is archived.](https://www.buffalo.edu/access/services/service2/archived-content.html) Aspiring physician-scientists showcased 38 original research projects at the 2016 Medical Student Research Forum. The displays showed work they conducted at the University at Buffalo, its partner health care agencies and institutions nationwide. Overall, 39 medical students shared their projects with peers and faculty members through diverse poster presentations. Three Class of 2018 students won top prizes for their presentations. \"This forum provides an excellent interactive opportunity for these dedicated young scientists to present and discuss their results with many of the local experts here at UB,\" says [Anthony A. Campagnari, PhD](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=aac), senior associate dean for research and graduate education. He points out the high level of participation demonstrates that a significant number of medical students understands the importance of research to the practice of medicine. \"By participating in these scientific programs, these medical students have obtained a much better understanding of the essential link between the laboratory bench and the bedside,\" Campagnari says. ''Their experience in performing medical research will serve them well into their professional careers.\" A faculty panel selected three outstanding projects for special recognition, all of which were conducted by second-year medical students. [Michael E. Cain, MD](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/about/leadership_and_administration/dean.html), vice president for health sciences and dean of the [Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/), presented certificates to the award-winning students (listed below) during the Jan. 28 event in the atrium of the Biomedical Education Building. Remon S. Bebawee, Class of 2018 \"Dual IgA Protease Expression By Nontypeable Haemophilus Influenzae During Carriage In Adults With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\" Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a common cause of exacerbations in patients with COPD, contain IgA proteases that cleave the mucosal IgA1 antibody, rendering it ineffective for pathogen detection. Bebawee investigated the IgA protease expression of persistent NTHi strains isolated from longitudinally obtained sputum samples from two participants in the Buffalo VAMC COPD study clinic and found: Mentors: Kirkham and [Timothy F. MD](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=murphyt), SUNY Distinguished Professor in the [Department of Medicine](/departments/medicine.html). Victor A. Janmey, Class of 2018 \"Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid: HIPAA Breach Vulnerabilities In De-Identified Data Sets Via Indirect Identifiers\" Janmey found that indirect, non-HIPAA identifiers pose a significant risk to patient privacy and that there are identifiable use cases such as motor vehicle accidents which can lead to breaches of patient privacy. His research showed that filtering location from these records made it very difficult for this information to lead to unwanted reidentification of de-identified clinical records. Mentors: Christopher Crowner and Elkin, MD](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=elkinp), professor of [biomedical informatics](/departments/biomedical-informatics.html). Jeff Bulger, Class of 2018 \"Evaluation Of A Potential Virulence Factor In Hypervirulent Klebsiella Pneumoniae\" A new, more dangerous strain of the bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) has emerged after first being described in the Asian Pacific Rim in 1986. Bulger's research team islolated a specific gene it believed could have an important role in the organism's infection model and that without this gene product, growth of the bacterium would be impaired. In order to test this hypothesis, they created a mutant strain of the bacterium in which this gene was deficient. By comparing the growth of this mutant with the original strain in various human fluids, they were able to show that there was no significant difference in growth between the two, thus indicating that this gene is not important in these specific environments.
