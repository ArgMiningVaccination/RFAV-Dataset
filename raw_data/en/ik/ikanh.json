I will not engage in excusing the Trudeau liberals abysmal strategy and management of a covid vaccine (among many others). The liberal media will go to great lengths to make excuses, drag up old decisions from the 80's? They bet on the wrong horse, a China horse called sinovac and we can debate why on earth we would ever, ever give them a dime for what they have brought upon all of us and they hold 2 Canadians would be enough to fire them all. \"2.5 Key Players in Canada 2.5.1 Vaccine Manufacturers, Developers and Researchers Despite the tremendous value of vaccines - and their proven impact on public health - fewer companies are currently investing in the vaccine market sector worldwide. As a whole, the global vaccine industry has recently undergone significant consolidation; over the past 30 years, the number of companies engaged in the development and manufacturing of vaccines has declined from roughly 25 to five. 44 Potential factors that have contributed to the decision for several companies to abandon their vaccine production lines (including, among other challenges, complexity of development, production and quality control) are discussed in further detail in Paper 7 regarding manufacturing and supply issues. As of early 2009, the Canadian vaccine landscape mirrors the highly concentrated structure of the global vaccine marketplace, with the \"top tier\" vaccine companies currently including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Canada, Merck Canada Ltd., Novartis, Pfizer Canada (formerly Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Canada), and sanofi pasteur. All of these players represent Canadian divisions of the respective multinational companies headquartered in Europe (GSK, Novartis, sanofi aventis) or the United States (Merck, Pfizer). While sanofi pasteur has a large-scale vaccine manufacturing facility based in Toronto (known as the Connaught Campus),45 GSK has vaccine production facilities in Qu\u00e9bec City and Laval, Qu\u00e9bec.46 These Canadian facilities supply vaccines for global clinical trials and/or commercial sales (e.g. for influenza and acellular pertussis vaccines, by GSK and sanofi pasteur, respectively). Merck, Novartis, and Pfizer do not presently have vaccine manufacturing facilities in Canada. Key vaccines of the five top tier companies that are currently available on the Canadian market are listed in Table 2.4. Further details are provided in Paper 5 (Tables 5.1 and 5.2) regarding these and other vaccines approved in Canada for infants, children, adults and travellers. 18 [http://www.biotech.ca/vaccines.](/ExternalLinkInterstitial?redirectTo=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biotech.ca%2Fvaccines.) In the context of major vaccine manufacturers, it is noteworthy that Merck Canada recently brought positive profile and distinction to the Canadian vaccine industry when its product, Gardasil, received the Prix Galien Canada 2008 Innovative Product Award.47 This prestigious award, considered as the Nobel Prize for pharmaceutical research, is given to the product that has made the most significant overall contribution to patient care in Canada in terms of efficacy, safety, benefits and innovation.
