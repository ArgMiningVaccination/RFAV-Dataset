However, if you sit at a temple, surrounded by an ethereal landscape in a remote mountain area as you listen to the tinkling of wind chimes, you may soon be able to ease your weary and tired mind. If you can't escape to a remote temple in the mountains, a templestay at Bongeunsa Temple, a thousand-year-old temple located in the middle of Gangnam, is a great alternative. Bongeunsa Temple offers a one-night templestay program that lets you experience an ascetic lifestyle and gives you a chance to examine yourself, your relationships, and your direction of life, as you take a break from your daily routine. At the temple, you can take part in a Buddhist service, tour the temple, and perform seon meditation, a common ascetic method of Korean Buddhist meditation. The templestay also includes a tea ceremony that awakens your five senses as you hear the water boiling, smell the refreshing scent, appreciate the hue, and savor the taste of the tea, and feel the warmth of the cup in your hands. After completing all the scheduled activities, including the \"joint effort\" exercise and the \"108 prostrations,\" you will find yourself leaving with a clearer mind and body. - - Major programs and price - One-night Experiential Templestay - 50,000 won / One-night Regular Templestay - 70,000 won (adult), 50,000 won (student) - Business hours - Regular templestay Saturday-Sunday (one night) * Visit the website or call to make a reservation. - - Web Site - - - Web Site Language - Korean, English, etc - Phone - 02-3218-4826 - Language service - English - - Address - 531, Bongeunsa-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul - - Transportation - - Subway - Bongeunsa Station (Seoul Subway Line 9), 140 m from Exit 1 "}
