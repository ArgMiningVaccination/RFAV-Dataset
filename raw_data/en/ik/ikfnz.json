However, for women who desire natural solutions, there are good alternatives. Use of conventional combination estrogen and progestin hormone therapy (Prempro) and estrogen therapy (Premarin) for menopause plummeted in 2002 because of their link to a significantly increased risk of heart attack, stroke, blood clots, [breast cancer](/topic/health/diseases-illnesses/breast-cancer-HEDAI0000012-topic.html), and [dementia](/topic/health/diseases-illnesses/alzheimers-disease-HEDAI000007-topic.html) when taken long-term, as shown in the Women's Health Initiative study. Experts still deem conventional hormone therapy (CHT) appropriate for symptom relief in early menopause but recommend using the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. PHYTOESTROGENS Some plant foods naturally contain compounds that either mimic or moderate the body's own estrogen actions, so we call them phytoestrogens. Three of the most common phytoestrogens are: Isoflavones, including genistein and daidzein, which are most prevalent in minimally processed soy foods (preferably organic), such as tofu and soy milk. Lignans, which are abundant in flaxseeds, can be ground and added to salads, smoothies, entrees, and baked goods. Coumestans are plentiful in alfalfa sprouts and clover sprouts, which you can grow at home from seeds if unavailable at supermarkets. Use them in salads and sandwiches. Overall, phytoestrogens--especially combinations of isoflavones and lignans, such as found in the supplement Femarelle--may be beneficial for many menopausal symptoms, according to a research review in the January 2014 issue of Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Benefits include reducing the intensity (and sometimes the frequency) of hot flashes, supporting vaginal health, improving sleep and brain function, and promoting bone health. Additionally, phytoestrogen use doesn't appear to increase risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, or heart disease. Unfortunately, studies of phytoestrogens in menopause usually test the plant compounds against a placebo rather than against CHT, so direct comparisons of effectiveness are limited. PERSONALIZED EFFECTS Although eating minimally-processed soy foods and taking isoflavones or other phytoestrogen supplements may help some menopausal women, dosing from foods can be imprecise due to different growing conditions, normal variation in daily food intake, and variable nutrient absorption. Further, bacteria in the gut convert some phytoestrogens to compounds with estrogen-like actions, but this conversion fluctuates depending on eating habits, gut health, and genetics, and it can be shut down for several weeks by taking antibiotics. So, the individual effectiveness of phytoestrogens, either from supplements or foods, will vary and may work better for those requiring minimal hormone support. Women may inadvertently upset delicate hormone balance by self-medicating with phytoestrogen supplements, says Rudy Dragone, R.Ph., an Arizona-based compounding pharmacist (those who make medications \"from scratch\") and author of \"Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy.\" So, discuss supplementation with your health care practitioner. Bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) A prescription-based alternative to phytoestrogen-rich foods and supplements is BHT, which consists of hormones that are identical in chemical and molecular structure to those produced in the human body, Dragone says. They are generally made with extracts from soy or wild yams, which a lab converts to the desired hormone. (In comparison, CHT is often completely synthetic or derived from animals.) \"If you are allergic to soy and take BHT made from soy, you will not have an allergic reaction, because the BHT has been chemically modified and no longer contains any soy,\" Dragone says. BHT may either be obtained through a conventional pharmacy in standard doses and formulations that are [FDA](/topic/health/food-drug-administration-ORGOV0000136161-topic.html)-approved (such as Estrace and Prometrium) or in custom formulations (such as bi-est and tri-est) through a compounding pharmacy, based on collaboration between your doctor and a compounding pharmacist. \"Custom compounded BHT allows the most flexibility in tailoring the dosage, medication form, and inactive ingredients, particularly in the case of allergies to standard ingredients,\" Dragone says. Bioidentical estrogen and progesterone may also be compounded together into a single pill. Although studies have shown the safety and effectiveness of standardized BHT products for treating menopausal symptoms, there is a lack of large-scale, randomized, controlled studies for custom-compounded BHT. Preliminary, case-based evidence of the effectiveness and safety of custom compounded BHT is encouraging, however.
