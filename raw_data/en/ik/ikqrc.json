In contrast to the decision below, a wide variety of non-Article III courts have concluded that they can, and should, in appropriate circumstances, aggregate cla ims under statutory authority parallel to that which Congress has provided to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC). See Appendix A (collecting aggregation rules ). Amici thus make three points in support of Claimant-Appellant Conley F. Monk, Jr .'s position that the CAVC may use either class actions or other informal procedures to aggregate cases. First, Congress has the power, within constitutional limits, to create special courts whose judges do not receive the salary and tenure protections described in Article III of the Constitution. When doing so, Congress generally grants \" non- Article III\" courts broad discretion to craft procedures they deem necessary and appropriate to adjudicate the cases and claims that come before them . Second, non -Article III courts employ a wide range of procedures to aggregate cases and claims at both the \" trial\" and \"appellate \" levels. For example, non-Article III courts have adopted rules that permit joinder, consolidation, and class actions. And even in the absence of a specific rule, non-Article III courts have aggregate d particular cases and claims. The fact that non- Article III courts deploy a wide range of aggregation procedures reflects an appropriate and effective - 3 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 10 Filed: 12/04/2015 division of labor between Congress and the courts. While Congress creates and defines the jurisdiction of non-Article III courts, the courts apply their expertise to determine the procedures necessary and best- suited to exercise that jurisdiction. Third, non-Article III courts use aggregation to promote efficiency, consistency, and fairness. Aggregation enables courts to pool information about common and recurring problems efficiently , fosters more consistent outcomes in similar cases than is possible through case-by -case adjudications , and improve s access to legal and expert assistance for parties who have limited resources and whose claims may appropriately be pursued through collective mechanisms. Below, Amici provide examples of the use of aggregation by non-Article III courts . As Amici detail, aggregation is especially useful when, as here, a party seeks declaratory or injunctive relief in response to an alleged inst itutional or system -wide harm. ARGUMENT I. CONGRESS GENERALLY GRANTS NON-ARTICLE III COURTS BROAD DISCRETION TO ADOPT THEIR OWN PROCEDURES . The Supreme Court has long recognized that Congress may create courts in which judges do not receive the salary and tenure protections required by Article III of the Constitution. Am. Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 511 (1828) . When Congress creates such non-Article III courts, it usually employs one - 4 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 11 Filed: 12/04/2015 of its enumerated powers in Article I, in combination with the \" necessary -and- proper \" clause. U.S. Const. A rt. I, \u00a7 8.2 When Congress creates non -Article III courts, it both defines their jurisdiction and grants them the power to prescribe rules of practice and procedure to carry out their statutory mandates. See, e.g., 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 12a (authorizing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) \"to make and promulgate such rules and regulations as, in the judgment of the Commission, are reasonably necessary to effectuate any of the provisions or to accomplish any of the purposes of\" the Commodity Exchange Act); 26 U.S.C . \u00a7 7453 (\"[T]he proceedings of the Tax Court ... shall be conducted in accordance with such rules of practice and procedure ... as the Tax Court may prescribe, \" but consistent with the Federal 2 Some non-Article III judges, like bankruptcy and magistrate judges, are appointed by Article III judges and work inside the Article III branch. See, e.g. , 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. ; Resnik, \"Uncle Sam Modernizes His Justice \": Inventing the Federal District Courts of the Twe ntieth Century for the District of Columbia and the Nation, 90 Geo. L.J. 607 (2002) . Other non-Article III adjudicators work outside Article III, in bodies sometimes termed \"legislative courts\" and in administrative agencies. See, e.g. , 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7441 et seq . (establishing the United States Court as a stand- alone court); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 153 & 160 (establishing the National Labor Relations Board as an independent regulatory agency and granting it authority, inter alia, to hear complaints regarding unfair labor practices). - 5 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 12 Filed: 12/04/2015 Rules of Evidence for bench trials in the United States District Court s for the District of Columbia .).3 Non-Article III courts usually enjoy substantial discretion to develop their own procedures under such grants of authority. For example, in Commodity Futures Trading Comm 'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833 (1985) , the Supreme Court rejected the lower court' s conclusion that the CFTC lacked the power to join counterclaims. Id . at 842. The Supreme Court base d its holding, in part, on the \"the sweeping authority Congress delegated to the CFTC. \" Id. at 842. In particular, the Supreme Court relied on statutory language that permits the CFTC to \"make and promulgate such rules and regulations as, in the judgment of the Commission, are reasonably necessary \" to accomplish the purposes of the statute authorizing its existence. Id . (citing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 12a). In some cases, non -Artic le III courts enjoy more power to develop procedural rules than Article III courts. Most non -Article III courts are not limited by the Rules Enabling Act, which says that Article III courts may only \"prescribe 3 See also 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 156 (granting the National Labor Relations Board \" authority ... to make, amend, and rescind ... such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out\" its statutory mandate); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a) (\"The Commissioner of Social Security shall have full power and authority to make rules and regulations and to establish procedures, not inconsistent with the provisions of this title, which are necessary or appropriate to carry out such provisions... .\"); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e - 16(b) (empowering the EEOC to \" issue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its re sponsibilities \" with respect to federal employees). - 6 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 13 Filed: 12/04/2015 general rules of practice and procedure \" that do not \" abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 2071 -72. By contrast, many non -Article III courts have no such limitation. For example, under its statutory authority, the Tax Court may adopt any procedural rule \" as the Tax Court may prescribe, \" so long as it conducts its proceedings in accordance with the rules of evidence for bench trials in the United States District Court s for the District of Columbia. 26 U.S.C \u00a7 7453 . In addition, like their Article III counterparts, non-Article III judges enjoy inherent authority to develop appropriate procedures to \" manage their own affairs. \" Compare Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 (1991) ; Link v. Wabash R. R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 (1962) (observing some powers are \" governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases\"), and United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. ( 7 Cranch ) 32, 34 (1812) (\"Certain implied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution,\" powers \"which cannot be dispensed with in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others. \"), with Freytag v. C.I.R. , 501 U.S. 868, 889 (1991) (holding that non -Article III tribunals, in a ddition to Article III courts, \"exercise the judicial power of the United States \"). When authorizing the CAVC, Congress granted the CAVC power to conduct hearings \"in accordance with such rules of practice and procedure as the Court - 7 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY 38 U.S.C \u00a7 7264 (emphasis added). That statutory grant is comparable to the authority given to the CFTC, the Tax Court, and the other courts described above, all of which have appropriately used their authority to design their own procedures. Whether promulgating an aggregate rule or not, the CAVC also enjoys inherent authority \"to manage its own affairs\" and \"control court proceedings before it. \" In re Bailey , 182 F.3d 860, 86 4 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Chambers v. NASCO , Inc., 501 U.S. at 43) . Congress' s decision to vest courts and tribunals with procedural flexibility reflects a basic feature of Am erican procedure: courts need power to shape their own rules and, when appropriate, to adapt rules to respond to the issues that come before them.4 II. NON-ARTICLE III COURTS USE THEIR STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO AGGREGATE CLAIMS AND CASES IN A VARIETY OF WAYS . The CAVC statute, which gives it the power to make \" rules of practice ,\" encompasses a wide range of procedures, including the power to aggregate cases 4 See William B. Rubenstein, Procedure and Society: An Essay for Steven Yeazell, 61 UCLA L. Rev. Discourse 136, 141 (2013) (\"[L]itigation is properly structured when its shape is the same as the shape of the underlying societal events. \"); Goldberg v. Kelly , 397 U.S. 254, 268 -69 (1970) (\"The opportunity to be heard must be tailored to the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard. \"); Van Harken v. City of Chicago , 103 F. 3d 1346, 1351 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"The due process clause is not a straitjacket, preventing state governments from experimenting with more efficient methods of delivering governmental services... .\"). - 8 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 15 Filed: 12/04/2015 and claims. Non -Article III tribunals may (a) enact formal rules to join, consolidate or certify class a ctions; (b) aggregate using informal proceedings ; and (c) exercise this power at both the \"trial\" and \"appellate \" level. A. Non-Article III courts promulgate rules providing for aggregation . Relying on general grants of authority to adopt their own procedures, more than forty non -Article III courts have promulgated rules permitting the consolidation of cases to hear claims.5 Some of these non-Article III courts have promulgated formal class actions rules. Examples include the Bankruptcy Courts, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and the Personnel Appeals Board. See Fed. R. Bank r. P. 7023 ( providing that Federal Rule of Civil P rocedure 23 applies in adversary 5 Appendix A provides a list of more than eighty rules promulgated by non -Article III tribunals that allow for consolidation, joinder, or class actions. For a sampling of such procedures adopted across the administrative state, see, e.g., 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.33 (permitting the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to consolidate any proceedings instituted in the same region under section 10(a) -(i) of the Act for the Prevention of Unfair Labor Practices where he \" deems it necessary in order to eff ectuate the purposes of the Act\" ); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1081.204 (permitting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to consolidate adjudicatory proceedings \" for some or all purposes\" where there is a material common question of law or fact); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 426.410 (permitting the Department of Health & Human Ser vices to consolidate complaints relating to Medicare Local Coverage Determinations where there is a common question of law or fact); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 68.16 (permitting the Department of Justice to consoli date where the evidence and matters at issue are \" substantially similar \" in hearings to be conducted regarding allegations of unlawful immigration- related employment practices, and document fraud). - 9 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 16 in the Bankruptcy Courts); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.204 (permitting the EEOC to hear class action claims involving federal employees); 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1025.18 (provid ing for the CPSC as a class action); 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 28.97 (providing employees power to pursue class action s with the Personnel Appeals Board).6 The EEOC 's experience is illustrative. Congress vested the EEOC with the power to hear discrimination claims brought by federal employees and \" to issue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities under this section. \" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e - 16(b) . Relying on that language, in 1992, the EEOC adopted a class action procedure. See 57 Fed. Reg. 12,634 (Apr. 10, 1992); 64 Fed. Reg. 37,644 (July 12, 1999). 6 There have been some cases where non -Article III courts chose not to adopt class action rules. In those cases, however, there was no question about whether those courts had the authority to adopt class action rules if they had wished to do so. In 1992, after Congress directed the CFTC to study the use of class actions in its own proceedings, the CFTC decided not to adopt a class action rule based largely on the availability of class action reparation claims in federal court. Rules Relating to Reparation Proceedings , 59 Fed. Reg. 9631 (Mar. 1, 1994). Last year, the Federal Communication Commission, which has only one full- time judge, similarly rejected a proposal to hear class actions, reasoning that \"such suits may be brought in federal court.\" In the Matter of Petition of Solvable Frustrations, Inc. to Amend Part 1 of the Commission's Rules to Specify Procedures for Class Action Complaints , 29 F.C.C. Rcd. 4205 ( 2014 ). Of course, unlike those other areas of law, the CAVC is the only court that can review certain decisions of the Board of Veterans ' Appeals (BVA) . Pub. L. 100 -687, \u00a7 301, (codified at 7252 ). - Document: 59 Page: 17 Filed: 12/04/2015 In 2004, the Postal Service challenged that rule. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) for the United States Department of Justice rejected that challenge and confirmed the EEOC 's broad authority to use class actions to aggregate claims.7 Observing that class actions were \"procedural in nature, \" the OLC concluded that the EEOC could properly adopt class a ction rules under its congressional directive to issue \" such rules ... as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. \"8 Indeed, just as class actions fall \" within the Supreme Court' s mandate to adopt rules of ' practice and procedure ' for the district courts, ... [t]here is no reason why [other courts] cannot use the same device, if it is appropriate. \" Quinault Allottee Ass'n & Individual 1272, 1274 (Ct. Cl. 1972) (holding the Court of Claims may certify class actions in appropriate cases). A part of the explanation stems from the function of class actions , which are \"procedural technique[s] for resolving the claims of many individuals at one time ..., comparable to joinder of multiple parties and 7 When two or more Executive agencies cannot resolve a dispute between themselves, OLC may resolve the dispute.

A class action, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a species), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate suits. \"). B. Non-Article III courts aggregate using informal methods . Like Article III courts, which aggregate with different levels of formality, 9 many non-Article III courts also aggregate claims and cases without adopting a formal procedure to do so.10 For example, the Office of Special Masters in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (the \"Vaccine Court \") has not put forth a rule on aggregation. But, for some two decades, the Vaccine Court has relied instead on its general authority to \" determine the format for taking evidence[,] ... hearing argument[,] \" and to \"apply [its] expertise \" from one case to 9 See Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litig ., \u00a7\u00a7 1.02 (2010) (describing informal aggregation); Howard M.

Probs. 5 (1991) . 10 See, e.g., In re S & G Fin. Servs. of S. Florida, Inc. , 451 B.R. 573, 582 (Bankr. 42 S.D. Fla. 2011) (\"[I]t is well within this Court' s equitable powers to allow substantive consolidation of entities under appropriate circumstances, whether or not all of those entities are debtors in bankruptcy. \"); Marshall Associated Contractors, Inc. v.

Thus, when faced with large numbers of claims for compensation, the Vaccine Court developed \" omnibus proceedings \" to more efficiently process claims involving the same alleged vaccine -related injury. Cedillo v. Sec 'y of Health & Human Servs. , No. 98 -916V, 2009 WL 331968 at Cl. Feb. 12, Fed. Cl. 158 (2009), aff'd, 617 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2010) . In an \"omnibus proceeding, \" a single special master hears evidence and makes a decision on a theory of general causation\u2014for example, whether a rubella vaccine can cause chronic art hropathy and, if so, under what circumstances. Id. at *12. The \" general causation\" evidence is then available for application in individual cases. Id . Such \"omnibus proceedings \" work much like issue class actio ns in the federal courts.11 11 See Betsy J. Grey, The Plague of Causation in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act , 48 Harv. J. on Legis. 343, 414 n.254 (2011) (stating that \"omnibus proceeding[s]\" in the Vaccine Court are \"treated like a class action\"). \" Issue class actions \" allow parties to achieve the economies of class actions for a part of the case\u2014like whether a defendant lied to investors\u2014even if courts could not manageably try the remaining individual issues of causation and damages as a class. Elizabeth C. Burch, Con structing Issue Classes , 102 Va. L. Rev _ (forthcoming 2016) (\"[C]ourts have properly separated eligibility components such as pla intiffs ' specific and proximate causation, reliance, and damages to facilitate issue classes in employment-discrimination, environmental -contamination, and consumer -fraud litigation. \" (collecting cases)), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2600219. - 13 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 20 Filed: 12/04/2015 Another illustration of aggregation without a general rule comes from the Court of Claims, which also concluded that it had the authority to certify class actions before it adopted a class action rule: We could, of course, refuse to take any steps at all until a general rule is prescribed, but we think the better road to follow, until we are clearer as to the shape of the class- suit needs in this court and the functioning of various class- suit devices, is to proceed on a case- by- case basis, gaining and evaluating experience as we study and decide the class-suit issues presented by individual, concrete cases coming up for resolution. If we ultimately adopt a general rule, it will be in the light of this ad hoc experience . Quinault Allottee Ass'n , 453 F.2d at 1276. 12 Yet another example comes from the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA), which hears Medicare billing disputes. OMHA has long relied on its implied authority to aggregate thousands of similar cases raised by health care providers against the federal government. See In re Apogee Health Serv., Inc. , No. 769 (Med icare Appeals Council Mar. 15, 1999) ; cf. Chaves Cnty . Home Health Servs. v. Sullivan, 931 F.2d 914, 919-22 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (finding that mass consolidation and other actuarial tools in Medicare adjudication comports with d ue process). OMHA adjudicators assert the power to identify, process, consolidate and sometimes sample large numbers of similar cases ; when doing so, the OMHA 12 The Court of Claims did not formally adopt a class action rule until 2002. The class action rule ultimately promulgated by the Court of Claims \"adopt[ed] the criteria for certifying and maintain ing a class action ... set forth in Quinault .\" Committee Notes, 2002 Revision, Rule 23 of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims. - 14 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 21 Filed: 12/04/2015 relies on grants of authority akin to those of many other non-Article III courts . Compare 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1044 (providing for consolidation of two or more cases where the issues \"are the same issu es that are involved in another request for hearing \" for purposes of \"administrative efficiency \"), with U.S. Vet. App. R. 3 (e) (\"Appeals may be consolidated by order of the Court on its own initiative or on a party 's motion. \"). C. Non-Article III c ourts aggregate at \"trial \" and \"appellate \" levels . The fact that a court may have characteristics of an \" appellate court\" does not preclude it from aggregating claims or cases through formal or informal processes. First, appellate level tribunals possess similarly broad discretion to aggregate cases. For example, many administrative courts of appeal consolidate cases that raise \" common questions of law or fact,\" including the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals, the HHS Departmental Appeals Board, the Department of Agriculture, OMHA, and the Environmental Appeals Board. 13 Indeed, OMHA is the third level of review in the Medicare system. See Department of Health and 13 See 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 6101.2 (authorizing the civilian board of contract appeals to consolidate contract dispute appeals where there are common questions of law or fact); 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 283.16 (authorizing judges in the Department of Agriculture to consolidate appeals by State agencies under the food stamp program); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 426.510 (authorizing the HHS Departmental Appeals Board to consolidate complaints relating to Medicare National Coverage Determinations where there are common issues); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.12 (authorizing the \" Environmental Appeals Board to consolidate proceedings for civil penalties or revocation of permits where there are common issues of law or fact\"). - 15 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 22 Filed: 12/04/2015 Human Services, Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals Website , http://www.hhs.gov/omha/glossary/glossary_main.html (\" In the Medicare appeals process the ALJ is the adjudicator at OMHA, the third level of the claim appeals process. \"). It bears mention as well that the Court of International Trade, an Article III court, hears administrative appeals of customs decisions and has allowed class actions since the early 1990s. See Nat'l Bonded Warehouse Assoc. v. United States, 14 C.I.T. 856 (1990) . Second, federal district courts may aggregate cases even when functioning in an \"appellate \" capacity, reviewing an agency' s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Federal courts have routinely certified class actions to review systematic practices in Social Security, immigration, and \u2014before 1988 \u2014veteran benefits cases. See, e.g. , Bowen v. City of New York , 476 U.S. 467 (1985) (social security); Alli v. Decker , 650 F.3d 1007 (3d. Cir. 2011) (immigration); Nehmer v. U .S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 118 F.R.D. 113 (N.D. Cal. 1987) (certifying a nationwide plaintiff class consisting of Vietnam veterans and surviving family members of deceased Vietnam veterans eligible to apply to VA for disability and death benefits due to exposure to Agent Orange). That federal district courts certified class actions in veteran cases prior to the creation of the CAV C is further support for the proposition that the CAVC may aggregate claims. This is so because, when Congress gave the CAVC exclusive - 16 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY 59 Page: 23 Filed: 12/04/2015 jurisdiction over veter ans' claims in 1988, it intended that the CAVC would exercise the same power as federal courts exercised in reviewing agency action.14 Indeed, the American Bar Ass ociation Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice 's 2003 Report specifically con cluded that Congress did not intend to prevent the CAVC from hearing class actions. See Am. Bar Ass 'n, Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice , Report to the House of Delegates 9-10 (2003) . III. AGGREGATION IS AN INDISPENSABLE TOOL FOR IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY, CONSISTENCY, AND FAIRNESS OF ADJUDICATION. Not only do non-Article III courts generally have the power to aggregate large groups of claims, but as illustrated above, many tribunals have relied on class action and other aggregate procedures to promote efficiency, consistency, and 14 The CAVC 's \"scope of review \" of BVA forth in 38 U.S.C. closely tracks a district court' s \"scope of review \" of an agency decision under \u00a7 706 the Administrative Procedure Act. See Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428, 432 n.2 (2011) (noting that \"the Veterans Court' s scope of review, \u00a7 7261, is similar to that of an Article III court reviewing agency action under the Administrative Procedure A ct\"); Watts v. SEC , 482 F.3d 501, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (observing that federal district courts review challenges to agency action unless Congress says otherwise). Both the CAVC and the district court are directed to \"decide all relevant question of law, interpret constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of\" agency action, \" hold unlawful and set asi de\" agency findings and conclusions \"found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law \" and perhaps most relevant to this case, \"compel [agency] action ... unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. \" U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(a) with 59 Page: 24 Filed: 12/04/2015 fairness. A ggregation can provide for the efficient pooling of information about common and recurring problems and for more consistent outcomes in similar cases than possible with case -by-case adjudications. A ggregation , moreover, is an important method to improve access to legal and expert assistance by parties with limited resources, so that individuals can pursue claims that otherwise would be difficult to do on an individual basis. See, e.g. , Butler v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. , 727 F.3d 796, 801 (7th Cir. 2013) (Posner, J.) (\" The realistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.\" (emphasis in original) (citation omitted)), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1277 (2014). A. Aggregation c an resolve group -wide harms more efficiently than can individual lawsuits. Aggregation can resolve systematic problems and address allegations of group -wide harm more efficiently than piecemeal individual adjudication. Aggregation eliminates the duplicative expenditure of time and money associated with traditional one -on-one adjudications. See In re Whirlpool Corp. Liab. Litig. , 722 F.3d 838, 859 (6th Cir. 2013) (citing Amgen Inc. v. Conn . Ret. Plans & Trust Funds, 133 S. Ct. 1184, 1191 (2013) ); William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 1:9, at 27 (5th ed. 2015) (\"Class actions are particularly efficient when many similarly situated individuals have claims sufficiently large that they would each pursue their own individual - 18 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 25 Filed: 12/04/2015 cases. In these situations, the courts are flooded with repetitive claims involving common issues. \"). The efficiencie s afforded by aggregation can be especially helpful in the administration and review of large benefit programs, such as those reviewed by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. See Michael D. Sant' Ambrogio & Adam S. Zimmerman, The Agency Class Action, 112 Colum. L. Rev . 1992, 2010 -12 (2012) (Without aggregation procedures, large public benefits programs waste resources in \"duplicative litigation, requiring frequent remands to address common factual errors, and hampering the efficient development and enforcement of law. \"). 15 For example, when over 5,000 parents claimed that a vaccine additive called thimerosal caused autism in children, the Vaccine Court used a national Autism Omnibus Proceeding to pool all the individual claims that raised the same highly - contested scientific questions. Cedillo v. Sec 'y of Health & Human Servs. , No. 98 - 916V, 2009 WL Cl. Feb. 158 (2009), aff'd, , 617 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2010). In the words of one Special Master, omnibus proceedings have \" turned out to be a highly successful procedural 15 See also S. Rep. No. 111 -265, at 35 (2009) (statement of Professor Michael P. Allen) ( \"[O]ne cannot avoid concluding that the absence of such authority to address multiple cases at once has an effect on system -wide timeliness of adjudication. \"); American Bar Ass 'n, Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice , Report to the House of Delegates 9 (2003) (recommending the use of class actions by the CAVC to address system -wide problems in veteran' s cases). - 19 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 26 Filed: 12/04/2015 device, \" facilitating settlement of individual cases and allowing those cases that proceed to a hearing to be resolved \" far more efficiently than if we had needed a full blown trial, with multiple expert witnesses, in each case. \" Id. (emphasis in original). Similarly, OMHA, which hears appeals from Medicare coverage determinations, expanded aggregation mechanisms to address a significant backlog that arose when the Medicare program stepped up efforts to recover excess billings. Under one initiative, hospitals, medical contractors and others may bundle hundreds of similar appeals at a time to facilitate settlement. 16 Under another, a medical provider may appeal more than 250 similar claims together, try a small sample of those claims before an administrative law judge, and extrapolate the results to the entire universe of claims. 17 Both programs have been so successful that medical providers are urging OMHA to expand opportunities to aggregate and settle large numbers of claims. 18 16 See U.S. D ep't Of H ealth & Human Servs ., Settlement Conference Facilitation , HHS.GOV (last visited Oct. 20, 2015), http://goo.gl/YSaUOU. 17 See U.S. D ep't of Health & Human Servs ., Statistical Sampling Initiative, HHS.GOV (last visited Oct. 20, 2015), http://goo.gl/y24gPF . 18 See, e.g., Letter to Nancy J.

Polston, Partner, King & Spalding, to Nancy Griswold, Chief - 20 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 27 Filed: 12/04/2015 In sum, the ability to experiment with a range of aggregation tools in appropriate cases has enabled non -Article III courts to adjudicate cases involving group harms more efficiently than they could us ing individual, case -by-case adjudication. B. Aggregation enable s more consistent applications of law. Aggregate procedures can provide uniform and consistent application of the law. Aggregate proceedings and settlements seek uniformity and distributive fairness\u2014 to treat like parties in a like manner. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 1:10, at 30 ([C] lass actions \" reduce[] the ris k of inconsistent adjudications. Individual processing leaves open the possibility that one court, or jury, will resolve a factual issue for the plaintiff while the next resolves a seemingly similar issue for the defendant. \"). And in cases seeking injunc tions or declaratory relief, a court may never hear from plaintiffs with competing interests in the final outcome, or over time, subject defendants to impossibly conflicting demands. See David Marcus, The Public Interest Class Action, 104 Geo. L.J . _ (forthcoming 2015) , available at http://goo.gl/nMEQev (\"Class action procedure Administrative Law Judge, OMHA (Dec. 5, 2014) (calling for expansion of settlement conference initiative for a wider range of claims be yond Medicare Part B), available at http://goo.gl/bC8G2t ; Letter from Robert Sowislo, Chair, Public Policy Committee, American Academy of Home Care Medicine, to Nancy Griswold, Chief Administrative Law Judge, (ALJ) , OMHA (Dec. 5, 2014) (observing that the SCF program \"provides a more expedient and in some ways straightforward process for [certain providers] \"). - 21 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 28 Filed: 12/04/2015 enables public interest plaintiffs to vindicate policies in the substantive law consistent with broad, systemic remedies ....\"). The EEOC, for example, has long utilized a class action procedure for resolving \"pattern and practice \" claims of discrimination by federal employees, including hearing s before specialized administrative law judges and appeals to the EEOC itself. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.204 . The EEOC deems the process important in light of the volume of claims it processes each year, the potential for ineff icient and inconsistent judgments, and the otherwise limited access to counsel. See, e.g. , 57 Fed. Reg. 12,634 , 12,639 (Apr. 10, 1992) (describing inconsistent judgments that result in the absence of class actions). In the past, the CAVC has suggested that it may promote uniform decision making by establishing binding precedent. See Lefkowitz v. Derwinski , 1 Vet. App. 439 (1991) . Although the doctrine of \" stare decisis \" aspires to make administrative decisions consistent, stare decisis cannot ensure the kind of uniform outcomes and legal access that aggregate adjudication can provide. First, the challenges that administrative appellate bodies face are well known; for example during the 201 4 fiscal year, the Social Security 's Appeals Council received 155,352 requests for review, processed 162,280 requests for review, and still had 150,383 requests for review pending at the end of the year. 19 See Jerry L. 19 https://ssa.gov/appeals/appeals_process.html#&a0=6. - 22 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 29 Filed: 12/04/2015 Mashaw, Richard A. Merrill, & Peter M. Shane, Administrative Law: The American Public Law System , 457 (6th ed. 2009) (discussing why precedent -based decisions are not realistic for ALJs in Social Security disability cases). Even an appellate body itself may not know about all its own prior decisions. Id. at 436- 37 (collecting cases where administrative tribunals departed from their own precedents). Second, stare decisis is not responsive to the problems of access to representation. Sant' Ambrogio & Zimmerman, 112 Colum. L. Rev. at 2024 -25. Indeed, stare decisis is an aspect of adjudication that requires lawyers; lawyers are uniquely suited to find relevant precedents, interpret the significance of rulings to the case at hand, and discuss their application. See, e.g., 2 Charles H. Koch, Jr., Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 5:67 (3d ed. 2010) (explaining how stare decisis disadvantages unsophisticated claimants who lack resources to be informed of individual decisions in a mass justice adjudicatory system). Thus, the complexity of a system rooted in case -by-case decision making makes legal representation even more critical. Of course, aggregation is not a panacea, and decisions to employ it require thoughtful attention to the commonalities of the claimants and their evidence. But when used wisely, aggregate adjudication \"may simultaneously improve - 23 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 30 Filed: 12/04/2015 uniformity, efficiency, and access to qualified counsel in a single proceeding. \" Sant'Ambrogio & Zimmerman, 112 Colum. L. Rev . at 2024. C. Aggr egation c an facilitate access to j ustice . Aggregation can expand access to legal representation. American Law Institute, Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litig . \u00a7 1.04 (2010) (describing the central \"object of aggregate proceedings \" as \"enabling claimants to voice their concerns and facilitating the rendition of further relief that protects the rights of affected persons \"). As is vivid in the context of arbitration, single -file litigation has great costs, and aggregation permits pooling of resources. Arbitration Study: Report to Congress, Pursuant to Dodd- Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act \u00a7 1028(a), Consumer Fin. Protection Bureau \u00a7 1, at 11 -14 (2015) (concluding that class actions deliver cash relief to more consumers\u2014especially those with small dollar claims\u2014than individual arbitration), available at http://goo.gl/NIarU8 . For example, between 2009 and 2014, AT&T, which prohibits its customers from using class arbitrations or class actions, see AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion , 563 U.S. 333 (2011) , had 85 to 120 million customers yearly. Fewer than thirty filed arbitrations in any of those five years. See Judith Resnik, Diffusing Disputes: The Public in the Private of Arbitration, the Private in the Courts, and the Erasure of Rights , 124 Yale L.J. 2804, 2812 -13 (2015) . - 24 - Case: PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 31 Filed: 12/04/2015 Aggregate procedures can also increase accountability and provide remedies for wide and diffuse harms that are too costly to be prosecuted through individual claims and appeals. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts , 472 U.S. 7 97, 809 (1985) (\"Class actions also may permit the plaintiffs to pool claims which would be uneconomical to litigate individually. For example, this lawsuit involves claims averaging about $100 per plaintiff; most of the plaintiffs would have no realistic day in court if a class action were not available. \"). Thus, aggregate procedures can serve an important democratic function, allowing groups of individuals col lectively to petition and redress widespread harm. Judith Resnik, Dennis E. Curtis & Deborah R. Hensler, Individuals With in the Aggregate: Relationships, Representation, and Fees, 71 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 296, 382 (1996) . The EEOC 's class action device, for example, allows the pooling of information about employers' policies and highlights patterns that may escape detection in individual proceedings. See 64 Fed. Reg. 37,644, 37,651 (July 12, 1999) (observing that \"class actions ... are an essential mechanism for attacking broad patterns of workplace discrimination and providing relief to victims of discriminatory policies or systemic practices\"). In some cases, the scale and visibility of an EEOC class action itself attracts the attention of government agencies, leading to workplace reforms. For example, after an EEOC class of disabled applicants challenged the State Department' s \"world- wide \" availability - 25 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 32 Filed: 12/04/2015 requirement for foreign service workers \u2014a policy that rejected candidates for promotion unless they could work without accommodation\u2014 the state department was alerted to a systematic problem in its hiri ng practice s.20 Additionally, the Vaccine Court' s omnibus proceedings allow all parties alleging vaccine -related injur y to benefit from the record developed in test cases and general causation hearings by the most qualified experts and experienced legal counsel. Cedillo , 2009 WL 331968 at *8 (noting how a select group of petitioners' counsel is charged with obtaining and presenting evidence in the omnibus proceedings). In one of the Vaccine Court' s first omnibus proceedings, the parties pooled common scientific evidence on the issue of whether a rubella vaccine caused chronic arthritis. As a result, the Vaccine Court raised the profile of an issue that, up to that time, had not been in focus, for both the Department of Health and Human Services and Congress. Ahern v. Sec 'y of the Dep 't of Health and Human Servs. , No. 90 -1435V, 1993 WL 179430 at *3 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Jan. 11, 1993) . Shortly after the decision, the Vaccine Injury Table was administratively modified, consistent with the decision, to include chronic arthritis as an injury generally associated with the rubella vaccine. See 60 Fed. Reg. 7678 (1995), revised 62 Fed. Reg. 7685, 7688 (1997) . 20 Press Release, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Affirms Class Action to Open State Department to Disabled Foreign Service Officers, MarketWatch, June 14, 2014, available at http://goo.gl/GXdHOK. - 26 - Case: 15-7092 CASE PARTICIPANTS ONLY Document: 59 Page: 33 Filed: 12/04/2015 As these examples illustrate, aggregation procedures are one means of expanding acce ss to non -Article III courts and tribunals and improving the information provided to them . CONCLUSION A host of non-Article III tribunals have interpreted their authorizing statutes, with language akin to that of the Veterans Judicial Review Act, to includ e the authority to consolidate claims, to certify class actions, and to use other forms of aggregate procedures in appropriate cases. For those courts, aggregation has proved to be an indispensable tool for promoting efficiency, consistency, and access to adjudication. Statutes authorizing non-Article III courts to make rules can and should be read to include the authority to create aggregate procedures so as to fulfill statutory mandates to decide disputes.
