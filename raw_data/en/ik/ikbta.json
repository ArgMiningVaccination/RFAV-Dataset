Hong Kong-listed Alibaba Health Information Technology, Ping An Good Doctor and JD Health International are also benefiting, on expectations that online drug sales and medical consultations will increase.

Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech, Hangzhou Alltest Biotech and Shenzhen YHLO Biotech, which make antigen test kits, have gained at least 20 per cent in the onshore market in the same span.

The beneficiaries of the government's easing of measures have withstood a recent pullback in the broader market, which has been whipsawed by growing concerns that the loosening of restrictions could spur a new wave of outbreaks that would dent the economic recovery. Health officials' attempts to reassure the public that the stockpiling of medicines is unnecessary have not deterred frenzied buying of Yiling Pharmaceutical's Lianhua Qingwen, the Chinese herbal drug used by the government to treat Covid-19. The capsules have been out of stock in many parts of the country, with prices more than doubling in the southwestern city of Chengdu, according to local media reports. Sales of antigen test kits have spiked in big cities like Guangzhou, one of the epicentres of the recent flare-up.

But the key question is how long the run can last.\" In Hong Kong, Alibaba Health has jumped about 130 per cent over the past month, while JD Health and Ping An Good Doctor have rallied at least 60 per cent. In spite of these hefty gains, optimism continues to mount. UOB has upgraded the rating on China's internet healthcare industry to overweight, citing rising demand for coronavirus drugs and online consultations, as well as the rapid digitalisation in the nation's healthcare system. Its favourite pick is Alibaba Health. Dai Ming, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Huichen Asset Management, prefers pharmaceuticals to the consumer companies seen by some traders as benefiting most from the reopening of the economy. \"Contrary to some calls, consumer stocks may get crushed in the early days of loosening because of a possible spike in infections,\" he said. \"Drug stocks will be good investments and "}
