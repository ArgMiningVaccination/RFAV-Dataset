An estimated 40 to 75 percent of Americans are defi - cient in vitamin D. In a northern state like Connecticut, vitamin D synthesis is reduced because of the angle of the sun's rays. The sun's radiation is not strong enough for the body to synthesize the hormone from November to April. Few foods are naturally high in vitamin D, except her - ring, salmon, tuna and shiitake mushrooms. Milk and \"fortified\" yogurt, oatmeal, cereals and orange juice provide most of the vitamin D in the American diet. Once vitamin D is acquired, it is stored in the body's liver or fat for later use. Dark-skinned individuals, older adults, obese individu - als and post-menopausal women are at a greater risk for vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to multiple sclero - sis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes (types 1 and 2), heart dis - ease, high blood pressure, dementia, cancer and infectious diseases. The hormone is vital to cell growth, the immune system, neuromuscular function and genetic expression. According to the National Institutes of Health, vitamin D may help prevent colon, prostate and breast cancers. Should You Be Tested? Ask your primary care physician or obstetrician-gy - necologist to test your serum vitamin D level. It typically takes four to six days to obtain the test result. Fasting is unnecessary, although it's preferable. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Result <20 ng/mL Deficient 20-30 Optimal Should You Take Vitamin D? According to the Institute of Medicine, the recom - mended daily allowance (RDA) is 600 IU for adults age 70 or under and 800 IU for those over age 70. Many physicians believe the threshold is too low and suggest 2,000 IU daily. For every 100 IU of vitamin D ingested, the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increases by 1 ng/mL. Your daily intake should not exceed the established upper limit of 4,000 IU, unless prescribed by a physician. Vitamin D 3, or cholecalciferol , is a fat-soluble hormone acquired by eating Vitamin D-rich foods or by taking sup - plements. Vitamin D contributes directly to bone health by promoting the absorption of calcium. When vitamin D levels are low, calcium can't be adequately absorbed. If your vitamin D levels are optimal, you don't need additional supplementation as long as your diet and sun exposure remain stable. While vitamin D levels greater than 150 ng/mL are considered toxic and can lead to many potentially harmful adverse events, vitamin D deficiency should be corrected as soon as possible. Should You Wear Sunscreen? A sunscreen with an SPF 8 rating can lower vitamin D production by 95 percent. Allowing sun exposure for a maximum of 20 minutes before applying sunscreen en - sures that your body synthesizes vitamin D, while keeping your risk of skin cancer low. Sun exposure for 20 minutes per day yields 10,000 IU of vitamin D. Recommended direct sunlight exposure is 20 minutes at least three times a week, with a UV Index of at least three. Will You Participate? Hartford Hospital's Department of Preventive Cardiology is studying the effects of vitamin D 3 supple - mentation (400 IU vs. 4,000 IU) on blood pressure. The study is seeking healthy adults between 18 and 50 years old, with blood pressure greater than 120/80 mm Hg and vitamin D insufficiency (less than 25 ng/mL), who are not currently being treated with blood pressure-lowering medications. You can have your vitamin D levels tested for free. Research participants will receive $25 for the initial blood draw and $150 for their time if they qualify and complete the study.

Now Hartford Hospital is offering an innovative, non- surgical alternative for aortic valve re- placement in patients who aren't healthy enough for open-heart surgery. The heart beats an estimated 2.5 billion times over a lifetime. The fist-size organ pumps about five thousand quarts of blood through the arteries and veins every day. The aortic valve opens only in one direction\u2014like a one-way gate\u2014al - lowing blood to flow forward, but not backward. Blood pumps through the aortic valve with every beat of the heart. The aortic valve plays a critical role in regulating blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta, the largest artery in the body. With advanc- ing age, many people develop aortic valve narrowing, or stenosis , of the opening of the heart's major valve. Narrowing of the valve can result from a build-up of calcium, fatty cho - lesterol deposits, genetics or age. The diseased valve disrupts the vital flow of blood to the heart, lungs and brain. The weakened heart struggles to pump enough blood through the smaller valve opening, leading to fainting, chest pain, heart failure, irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias), or cardiac arrest. Moreover, when the valve doesn't fully close, blood begins to leak back - ward through the valve, forcing the heart to work even harder. New Hope for Quality of Life The first patient to undergo the innovative procedure was Anthony J. Lombardi, a 91-year-old Wethersfield resident who lives alone with a white Maltese dog named \"Tiger Woods.\" His cardiologist warned that if his aortic valve wasn't replaced, he was likely to die or suffer serious, irre - versible worsening of his health. Lombardi's niece became worried when he suffered a half dozen faint -Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to improve the lifespan of patients with aortic valve narrowing, or stenosis, who have been told they can't have surgery. While not everyone is a candidate for TAVR, the recent FDA approval means that it's appropriate for frail or elderly patients who are too sick to have open- heart surgery.ing spells last fall. \"The cardiologist said the problem was progressive,\" his niece says. \"He had to give up driving because he never knew when he might pass out. The new proce - dure was a real lifesaver. Now he's getting stronger each day.\" \"Before the procedure I was so short of breath I had to sleep on the couch,\" recalls Lombardi. \"Now I'm feeling good. The doctors here do a wonderful job\u2014they don't overlook anything. When I saw my cardiologist two weeks after the procedure, he eliminated a lot of the pills I used to take every day.\" Lombardi was lucky. His cardi - ologist, Anthony F. LaSala, M.D., of Cardiac Care Associates, knew the Hartford Hospital team was gearing up to become the first hospital in the region to offer \"transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement\" (TAVR). In November, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the device for patients with inoperable aortic valve stenosis. Aortic Valve Stenosis \"Patients should ask their doctors about TAVR because they may have been told in the past that nothing could be done to fix their aortic valve stenosis,\" says Ray McKay, M.D., an interventional cardiologist who was instrumental in bringing the proce - dure to Hartford Hospital. Millions of patients worldwide have benefited from balloon angio - plasty and coronary stents to open blocked coronary arteries, using catheters inserted through a small incision in the groin. TAVR relies on a similar technique, but requires a much larger catheter tipped with an inflatable balloon. With the recent development of the flexible TAVR catheter delivery system, physicians are now able to thread an aortic valve replacement device from the femoral artery in the groin up through the blood vessels to the heart. \"We're guided by combined fluo - roscopy (X-ray) and echocardiography as we push the delivery system up 5through the iliac artery and deploy the new valve,\" adds Dr. McKay. The \"SAPIEN\" valve from Edwards Lifesciences is the first FDA-approved TAVR. Once the device springs into place, it remains anchored securely within the diseased valve. The device needs to be sturdy because the hu - man heart beats about 60 times a minute\u2014about 31.5 million beats per year. Replacing a Valve Without Surgery \"Surgery to replace the aortic valve is an effective treatment for severe aortic valve stenosis, but we know it's not an option for everyone,\" says Paul Thompson, M.D., chief of Cardiology. \"We are the first in the region to offer the TAVR procedure to our patients. We know it will have a significant impact on patient care throughout Connecticut and beyond because it offers hope to those who cannot un - dergo open heart surgery.\" \"TAVR gives us an opportunity for an unusual collaboration with col - leagues from interventional cardiol - ogy, anesthesiology and many other specialties,\" says David J. Underhill, M.D., a cardiac surgeon with Hartford Specialists, who eagerly embraced the multidisciplinary approach. \"Minimally invasive techniques are especially safe for older and sicker pa - tients. TAVR has the potential to revo - lutionize treatment for someone with a critical aortic valve condition who wouldn't survive a 'classic' operation. If the aortic valve isn't replaced, about 30 to 50 percent would be dead within a year.\" In elderly patients, severe aortic stenosis is often caused by the build- up of calcium (mineral deposits) on the flexible \"leaflets\" that move rhythmically with each throb of the heart. Over time, the aortic valve's leaflets become stiff, reducing their ability to open and close. When the leaflets don't open fully, the heart must work harder to push blood through the aortic valve and out to the rest of the body. \"As their diseased valves weaken, candidates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement will probably be hospitalized repeatedly,\" says inter - ventional cardiologist Immad Sadiq, M.D. \"TAVR not only has the poten - tial to improve their quality of life, but also the quantity, by prolonging their lives. We're actively looking for more inoperable patients who would benefit from the TAVR procedure.\" \"This therapy really opens up great potential for those who oth - erwise would have an untreatable condition,\" says Francis J. Kiernan, M.D., director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at Hartford Hospital. \"People with aortic valve stenosis experience chest pain, fainting or shortness of breath with activity. When the valve narrows to a pinhole, blood pumping out of the heart can't reach the brain. It's a relatively common disorder.\" Multidisciplinary Collaboration When Hartford Hospital's team successfully performed three trans - catheter aortic valve replacements in early February, it was the first non- surgical replacement of the aortic valve using the SAPIEN heart valve to take place in Connecticut. Successful deployment of the device draws on the expertise of physicians from many specialties. Hartford Hospital's collaborative team includes cardiac surgeons, interventional and technicians. \"The new valve is designed to replace a patient's diseased aortic valve without the use of a heart-lung machine,\" says anesthesiologist Rabi Panigrahi, M.D. \"TAVR patients must have serious medical issues in order to qualify for the procedure, so we must monitor them very carefully.\" According to TAVR administra - tive coordinator Marcin Dada, M.D., all TAVR patients are first carefully evaluated to determine whether they are candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement. To be eligible for TAVR, the prospective patient must have a greater than 50 percent risk of death with traditional aortic valve re - placement (with open-heart surgery) and an expected 80 percent risk of death within two years with medical therapy alone. \"In a national trial, TAVR was shown to be superior to maximal medical therapy for patients with severe critical aortic valve stenosis who were deemed inoperable,\" says Robert C. Hagberg, M.D., chief of Cardiac Surgery. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia, but takes less time than conventional valve replacement surgery. \"These patients are usually medically chal - lenging because of advanced age or debilitating conditions,\" says anes - thesiologist Marbelia Gonzalez, M.D. \"Transcatheter delivery of the device means there's very little pain, so we don't need as many inhalation agents or narcotics afterward.\" \"During the procedure, we perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to ensure the accurate place - ment of the aortic valve replacement in the annular ring,\" adds Justin Lundbye, M.D., medical director of the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit and director of the Cardiology Hospitalist Program at Hartford Hospital. \"We monitor the placement of the valve in real time as the interventional cardiologists manipulate the catheter into place and dilate the valve with increasingly larger balloons.\"The sturdy transcatheter aortic replace- ment valve (TAVR) is made from high- performance materials. The human heart beats about 60 times a minute\u2014about 31.5 million beats per year. 6PHYSICIAN PROFILE Robert C. Hagberg, M.D., the new chief of Cardiac Surgery, recently joined Hartford Hospital from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/ Harvard Medical School in Boston. He is a nationally renowned surgeon, researcher and educator whose arrival will contribute to cardiac surgery research at Hartford Hospital, expand the portfolio of cardiac surgical procedures and help us train the next generation of advanced heart surgeons. His current research interests include minimally invasive cardiac sur - gery, including techniques for cardiac resynchronization therapy, mitral valve repair, treatment for atrial fibrillation, stent grafting of the thoracic aorta and percutaneous valve techniques. Dr. Hagberg earned his M.S. degree at Stanford University and his medical degree from the Stanford University School of Medicine. He completed his training in general surgery as an intern and resident at Massachusetts General Hospital and was a cardiothoracic surgery fellow at Stanford. He also trained in cardiac transplantation for a year as a post- doctoral research scholar at Stanford. As an educator, he has been deeply involved in teaching the clinical practice of cardiac surgery to Harvard medical students and general sur - gical residents, as well as cardiothoracic surgical residents and fellows. He is a member of a number of regional, national and international medi - cal societies and has received several honors and awards for his work as a clinician and researcher. In addition to his professional expertise, Dr. Hagberg, a native of Springfield, Mass., was an award-winning swimmer at South Hadley High School. He received a full athletic scholarship in swimming at Stanford and was a collegiate All American. He still swims regularly for fitness.Robert C. Hagberg, M.D. Standard surgical aortic valve replacement is still the 'gold standard' treatment for aortic stenosis with excellent short and long-term outcomes, even in patients in their 80s or 90s. TAVR allows us to perform aortic valve replacement in a minimally invasive manner in extreme risk patients who would otherwise not be candidates for standard surgical aortic valve replacement because of their medical conditions or extreme frailty. \u2014Robert Hagberg, M.D. Chief of Cardiac SurgeryPHOTO HERE 7\"We all work simultaneously,\" adds cardiologist Donna M. Polk, M.D., director of Preventive Cardiology at Hartford Hospital. \"There are about 20 people in the room. We're monitoring echocardiographic readings as the interventional cardiologists and car - diac catheterization specialists deploy the device using X-ray fluoroscopy. The hybrid operating suite is already prepared with a perfusionist standing by in case we need to convert to an open-heart cardiac procedure.\" Visualizing the Way Forward Innovations in imaging give physi - cians the ability to view the heart in exquisite detail. Hartford Hospital's 64-slice LightSpeed VCT scanner creates an intricate high-definition image of the valve plane and arteries. In a single rotation lasting about a third of a second, the VCT captures 64 \"slices\" of anatomical data. The innovative imag - ing system\u2014so fast that it can capture images of a beating heart and coro - nary arteries in only five seconds\u2014gives the TAVR team physicians a roadmap to the heart. Minimally invasive procedures like TAVR require careful planning and dynamic high- resolution images. \"We perform a thorough preopera - tive assessment of the access route with advanced visualization of the aorta to facilitate the deployment and positioning of the TAVR device,\" says vascular and interventional radiologist Robert Spillane, M.D., of the Department of Radiology. \"Is the patient a candidate for TAVR? Can the device be delivered through the iliac artery?\" Hartford Hospital's advanced 3D imaging technology makes it possible for surgeons and cardiologists to plan a detour to avoid twisted or misshap - en abdominal arteries. \"One patient had a corkscrew in the left iliac artery, so the team decided to approach the heart from the right,\" says Dr. Spillane. \"The hospital's longstanding investment in 3D imaging equipment, computing power and infrastruc- ture ensures precise mapping of the anatomy. The team knew about the bend in the artery before they ever put the patient to sleep.\" \"Ten years ago cardiac surgeons had to cut ribs to perform a valve repair, but now we are collaborating with interventional cardiologists to deliver a new aortic valve without sur - gery,\" adds Dr. Underhill. \"Right now, the procedure is only available for pa - tients who otherwise wouldn't survive more than a year or two. I believe the FDA will eventually approve the tech - nique for other high-risk patients.\" \"We need to get the word out to cardiologists in the community about this new option for patients who otherwise couldn't be helped because they're not candidates for surgery,\" says cardiac surgeon Paul Preissler, M.D. \"Until now, these patients had no other options. We want family mem - bers to know that elderly patients with serious health problems may be candidates for non-surgical aortic valve replacement and longer, happier lives.\" For more information, call 860-545-1888 or visit www.harthosp.org/TAVR.

The word migraine comes from the Greek word for headache . The philosopher Plato advised: You must begin by curing the soul... Although everyone occasionally has a headache, a migraine typically causes intense throbbing pain on one or both sides of the head, along with nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness and sensitivity to light, noise or smells. A milder \"tension-type\" headache is a sensation of pressing and tightening on both sides of the head without nausea or light sensitivity. Obesity is associated with the development of chronic migraine. Over a third of all American adults are obese, which means that chronic migraine may be on the rise. More than 30 million Americans suffer from migraines. \"Today there are preventative medications and lifestyle changes that can stave off headaches,\" says neurologist Tanya R. Bilchik, M.D., of the Hartford Headache Center. \"Don't skip meals, get enough sleep, avoid triggers and learn to manage stress.\" Myth: Migraines are a mystery. Fact: Migraines often begin early in childhood in people with a family history of the disorder. Scientists have identified \"triggers\" that can cause recurring headaches in those susceptible to migraines because of genetic influ - ences or stress. Physical or emotional abuse in childhood has been linked to headaches in later life. Common mi - graine triggers include red wine, chocolate, caffeine, sex, pregnancy, menstruation, birth control pills, depression, fatigue or physical and emotional stress. Myth: More males than females suffer from migraines. Fact: Before age 10, boys and girls are equally likely to get migraines. After puberty, migraines affect girls three times more often than boys. The typical adult migraine sufferer is a woman under age 40. Myth: Migraines usually last an hour or two. Fact: Migraines can last for hours or days. Migraines can occur several times a week or once every couple of years. \"We're seeing more patients with 'chronic' migraines that happen 15 or more days a month for more than three months,\" says Dr. Bilchik. \"About 3.2 million people in the USA suffer from chronic migraine.\"Migraine Myths How Headaches Happen Myth: Most migraines are preceded by an \"aura.\" Fact: The telltale migraine aura involves visual, sensory or speech symptoms that strike just before blinding pain. \"Some people see twinkling lights, zigzags or spreading blind spots,\" says Dr. Bilchik, \"but only about 15 percent of migraine sufferers experience aura.\" Myth: Numbness always signals a stroke. Fact: A migraine may be mistaken for a stroke. While sudden numbness or visual loss can signal a stroke, most migraines strike young women with few cardiovascular risk factors. Numbness in an arm or leg\u2014or on one side of the face\u2014may be a symptom of a migraine. Seek immedi - ate medical evaluation by a physician to rule out a stroke. Myth: Most headaches are caused by sinus infections. Fact: \"Many patients have been misdiagnosed as having 'sinus' headaches,\" says Dr. Bilchik. \"Recurrent moderately severe headaches without fever or nasal discharge are likely to be migraines.\" Myth: Migraine medications don't work. Fact: \"We migraine-specific drugs,\" says Dr. Bilchik. \"Medications for migraine prevention include blood pressure drugs, anti-seizure medications and antidepressants. Triptans are one of the classes of migraine-specific medications used for acute treatment. Overuse of painkillers or Excedrin can cause a 'rebound' effect that makes migraines worse. Patients with chronic migraines who don't improve after trying many different preventative medi - cations sometimes improve with Botox injections.\" 9Fighting Skin Cancer Hartford Hospital's Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program Melanoma, a potentially deadly skin cancer, is rising in incidence faster than any other cancer in the United States. The disease now strikes everyone from aging Baby Boomers to youthful tanning salon regulars. Melanoma is now the most common form of cancer among young adults in their late 20s. The good news is that when caught early, melanoma can be successfully treated with a survival rate of nearly 100 percent. Hartford Hospital's Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program brings together experts across many disciplines for the treatment of early stage, advanced and metastatic disease. Through this program, high-risk patients are identified, treated and counseled. Patients are seen within one week. Conferences ensure a true multidisciplinary approach, with robust collaboration, communica tion and coordina - tion of care. \"Our team approach is especially valuable when a skin cancer diagnosis is ambiguous,\" says Andrew L. Salner, M.D., director of the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. \"We offer a comprehensive program with expertise in der - matology, pathology, oncology and surgery. Our dedicated group includes plastic surgeons who perform extensive reconstructive surgery and radiation oncologists who target difficult-to-reach tumors or residual cells.\" Hartford Hospital's dermatopathologist, Zendee Elaba, M.D., specializes in the diagnosis of melanoma and other skin cancers. She is board-certified in anatomic and clini - cal pathology, as well as in the sub-specialty of dermato - pathology. Early detection is crucial in skin cancer. A suspicious- looking growth is biopsied and the skin sample is re - viewed by a dermatopathologist under the microscope. This process of histopathologic analysis (examination of cells) remains the \"gold standard\" on which diagnosis and treatment decisions are based. \"Skin cancer is the most common cancer, with more than a million new cases each year,\" says Robert J. Piorkowski, M.D., chief of Surgical Oncology at Hartford Hospital. \"The incidence of melanoma is growing by three percent annually. Basal cell cancers can cause significant disability, while squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma can be lethal if not caught early.\"The Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program brings together expert radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians experienced in the latest imaging techniques and sentinel node identification. Members of Hartford Hospital's Division of Dermatology provide skin lesion diagnosis, treat selected cancers with Mohs (chemosur - gery) and other techniques, and collaborate with other team members. \"We can usually treat localized disease with surgery alone,\" adds Dr. Piorkowski. \"When we're removing a le - sion we sometimes see more advanced disease in lymph nodes that drain the melanoma site. Removal of those 'sentinel' nodes can help to stop melanoma from spread - ing to distant organs.\" The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved two new drugs for the treatment of advanced melanoma, says medical oncologist Robert D. Siegel, M.D., of Oncology Associates. The two drugs\u2014Zelboraf (vemurafenib) and Yervoy (ipilimumab)\u2014are the first drugs to demonstrate a significant response rate in patients with advanced disease. (The brand name is capi - talized and the generic is in parentheses.) Zelboraf is a targeted therapy for metastatic melano - ma (cancer that has spread to other part of the body) in patients with a specific type of abnormal BRAF gene. The gene mutation occurs in about 60 percent of melanomas. The other drug, Yervoy, is monoclonal antibody that may help the body to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. One way to prevent skin cancer is to avoid tanning salons. \"Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays causes DNA damage and skin cancer,\" says Dr. Elaba. \"Indoor tanning devices have UV radiation levels that far exceed what is found in nature. Numerous studies have linked the use of tanning devices to an increased risk of skin cancer.\" \"The sunburned Baby Boomers didn't know they would be prone to developing melanoma later in life,\" says Dr. Salner. \"If you develop a change in a mole or a new skin growth, you should see a physician promptly. Our team approach ensures the best possible care for patients with melanoma and other skin cancers.\" For more information, call 860-972-SKIN (7546). 10Dr. Zendee ElabaDepression tiptoes into the mind, bringing icy despair. The world seems empty and dark. Some sufferers lose their appetite, while others take comfort in overeating. Gnawing worry disrupts sleep, leaving victims feeling fa - tigued or restless. For many sufferers, the quest for lasting relief is elusive. Despite the benefits of antidepressant drugs and cogni - tive behavioral therapy, depression remains the number one cause of disability in the United States. Many people with a depressive illness never seek treatment, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, whose land - mark STAR*D trial\u2014one of the largest, independent and most robust studies\u2014found that major depression is often chronic, severe, and associated with other health conditions. Medication Drawbacks Effective antidepressant drugs have been available since the mid-1950s, but many people try a series of medi - cations in search of relief. Millions of people around the world have taken both older and newer types of antide - pressants. Only about one-third achieved \"total recovery\" or complete remission of all their symptoms. The seven-year STAR*D trial found that drugs and psy - chotherapy don't completely relieve depressive symptoms in nearly two-thirds of severely depressed patients. Most patients prefer to take a pill than to try cognitive therapy, the study showed. In patients with major depression, neurostimulation techniques such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and other innovative treatments can be lifesaving. Researchers have yet to unravel the biological under - pinnings of depression. Patients in the STAR*D trial often became discouraged after trying several drugs or stopped because of intolerable side effects. Although no one knows precisely how the drugs work, a placebo may work just as well as antidepressants, according to a recent \"60 Minutes\" TV show. No wonder patients are confused. New Therapies for Depression Researchers at the Institute of Living (IOL) are working independently and with pharmaceutical companies to in -vestigate new and better antidepressant medications. Half of depressed patients don't respond to a trial of a particu - lar antidepressant and as many as 20 percent of patients don't respond to any antidepressant medication. \"We are now conducting a Phase III trial of one prom - ising new medication and another drug we hope will amplify the effects of first-line treatment,\" says Andrew Winokur, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Psychopharmacology Research Unit at the IOL. \"Researchers continue to de - velop new medications, but it takes nearly eight years for a drug to go on the market.\" Depression results from a complex interplay of biol - ogy, genetics, family history, life experiences and stress. \"Those exposed to abuse in childhood are more prone to develop depression in adulthood,\" says Dr. Winokur. \"The IOL has a long history of clinical trials and research, in - cluding a partnership with the biomedical firm Genomas to develop DNA-guided 'personalized medicine' for pa - tients who don't respond to medications.\" Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone One promising treatment being investigated by Dr. Winokur is the use of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) for depression. Clinical trials have validated TRH as a treatment for various disorders, including depres - sion. Although clinical studies have hinted at the poten - tial therapeutic value of TRH injections, Dr. Winokur is excited at the prospect of developing the hormone in pill form. \"Research we have conducted for more than 30 years has produced a great deal of evidence that TRH is an important brain-regulating substance,\" says Dr. Winokur. \"Although it has traditionally been thought of as the hor - mone that regulates the secretion of thyroid hormones in the body, it serves an important role in brain activity that we hope will have a positive effect in combination with a standard antidepressant.\" To find out if you meet the criteria to participate in two clinical trials of new antidepressant drugs, call Jennifer at 860-545-750 2. Exploring New Treatments for Depression 12 What's Going Around... News & Breakthroughs in the Doctor's Office \"A rash is simply an area of irritated skin,\" says Ali Torabzadeh, M.D., or \"Dr. T\" to his patients at the Hartford Hospital Family Health Center in Avon. \"Although the majority of rashes aren't harmful, only your doctor can determine if the underlying medical cause needs to be treated.\" Rashes can be dry and scaly, red and itchy, wet and warm, crusty and blistered, or flat and painless. Rashes result from many condi - tions, both infectious and non-infectious. Contact your doctor if your rash is accompanied by fever, head - ache, joint pain, joint swelling or redness. Listed below is a sampling of reasons for a rash. See your primary care physician (PCP) for an accurate diagnosis. Noninfectious agents Rashes can result from allergies to food, medication, insect stings, metals (especially nickel), chemicals, skin irritants, sunburn or autoimmune conditions. Infectious agents Infection with certain bacteria (impetigo, cellulitis or abscess), viruses (chickenpox, cold sores or measles), fungi (ringworm or athlete's foot) and skin parasites (lice, bedbugs or scabies) can cause a rash. Lyme disease (from a deer tick bite) causes a flat, red, bull's-eye rash in 80 percent of cases.Irritant contact dermatitis Direct contact with a substance that physically, me - chanically or chemically irritates the skin disrupts the normal skin barrier. Mild irritants cause redness, itching or dryness; stronger irritants cause swelling, oozing, pain or blistering at the point of contact. Reducing exposure to soaps, cleansers, detergents or daily-use products often alleviates symptoms. Plants like poison ivy, oak and sumac can cause an itchy rash. Treatment includes over-the-coun - ter corticosteroid cream (hydrocortisone) or prescribed oral steroids. Eczema Eczema causes dry, itchy, scaly and red skin in children and adults. Heredity and, infrequently, food allergy may play a role. Symptoms include intense itching and red, scaly patches. Skin can become thicker, darker or scarred from repeated inflammation or scratching. Scratching can cause skin breakage, leading to infection (redness, swell - ing, pain, warmth and oozing). Eczema symptoms can improve and then flare periodically. Keep the skin moist by applying creams or ointments to dry skin immediately after bathing or showering. Hives Hives are bright red, raised, itchy welts, often with a pale center. Hives develop suddenly and disappear after a few hours to a few days. Intense itching is usually the most bothersome symptom. Hives are often caused by viral infections (the common cold), drugs (antibiotics, aspirin, ibuprofen, prescription painkillers) and insect stings. Call 911 if you also have difficulty breathing, chest tightness or swelling in the face or mouth. An eruption of hives from an insect sting or food allergy may indicate a serious condition called anaphylaxis, which must treated as soon as possible. Untangling the Riddle Alzheimer's disease spreads like an infection in the brain, report two studies from Columbia and Harvard. Dying brain regions fill with tangled strands of an abnormal protein called tau as the disease progresses. Scientists now think beta amyloid triggers the dis - ease, but tau transmits the \"contagion\" from nerve cell to nerve cell. Researchers are seeking a tau-blocking antibody.KRAS Risk Yale researchers say a genetic marker may help predict the risk of develop - ing ovarian cancer, a disease that's notoriously hard to detect. The \"KRAS-variant\" was found in a quarter of all ovarian cancer patients\u2014 and up to 61 percent of ovar - ian cancer patients with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer who don't have the risky BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.A Good Egg A 2011 U.S. Department of Agriculture study found that eggs are now 14 percent lower in choles - terol than in 2002 (possibly because of healthier feed). Harvard researchers say eating a daily egg won't in - crease your cardiovascular disease risk unless you have diabetes. The egg's nutri - tious package of B vitamins and protein causes only a negligible rise in serum cholesterol levels.Y Worry? Although the human Y (male) chromosome retains only three percent of the 600 genes it once shared with the X chromosome, it's not going extinct, according to a study in Nature from MIT's Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. Earlier researchers had warned of rapid genetic \"decay,\" but the Y chromo - some appears stable, with some genes dating from 300 million years ago.

The globe-shaped vegetable has been cultivated in the southern Mediterranean region for centuries. There's an art to preparing and eating artichokes. Once they're cooked, you can easily spread the leaves. Cut out the prickly inner leaves and fuzzy center, called the \"choke,\" leaving the tender \"heart\" at the bottom. If you want, you can peel off each petal and scrape away the soft inner pulp with your teeth. (Discard the remaining leaf.) Artichokes are rich in antioxidants, fiber and potassium, and when prepared as described in the recipe are low in sodium and a good source of healthy oils .Stuffed ArtichokesWash and dry artichokes. Cut the stems off the bottom so artichokes stay upright. Slice stems and place in a pot with bay leaves, 2 garlic cloves, 1-2 tbs. lemon juice and 2 tbs. olive oil. Cut off top quarter of artichoke. Clip the pointed tip of each leaf with kitchen shears or scissors. Remove bottom row of small leaves and discard. Place in pot with stems and other ingredients. Add 1 inch of water. Check frequently to ensure water doesn't boil away and add more water as necessary. Cover and simmer slowly for approximately 50 minutes or until tender. When fully cooked, spread leaves apart to create a center cavity for stuffing. Add stuffing just before serving. Stuffing: Combine tomatoes, 2 minced garlic cloves, herbs, breadcrumbs, ground pepper, cheese, 2 tbs. olive oil and vinegar. Firmly stuff the artichoke center and between the leaves. Serve warm or at room temperature. Pour remaining liquid over top.
