Study Abroad and International Travel, along with University of Arizona Leadership, are closely monitoring this evolving situation. Please refer to the [University's main Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information page](https://covid19.arizona.edu/) regularly for important campus information. We appreciate your partnership and patience as we navigate this situation. Study Abroad and International Travel staff are here to support you. Last updated: March 1, 2022, 9:45 a.m. MST What is the status of UArizona study abroad programs? If neither the destination country nor our international partner or study abroad provider have put any restrictions on immigration or program participation for our students, Arizona International will continue with study abroad planning. This planning will include an extensive, health, safety and security review of all programs and a continual assessment of the situation on the ground in the programs' host city(ies), country(ies) and region(s). While we are currently proceeding with several programs, the University reserves the right to cancel UA student participation in a program at any time should senior university leadership determine that our students may face undue risk in any of these locations. We will keep students informed and updated as we receive new information, but we also encourage you and your student to stay up to date on travel health, safety and security through reputable sources such as the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html), [U.S. State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html) and the [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). Are there virtual options if I want to have a international experience but don't want to travel? Yes! There are several virtual programs available. Please visit the study abroad [Start Your Journey](/study-abroad/start) page to search for programs. Can I get vaccinated before I study abroad? Though vaccination is not a requirement to study abroad, it is highly recommended. (Please note: certain locations or institutions abroad may require proof of vaccination in order to participate. Please check with your Program Coordinator for any questions or concerns.) All University of Arizona students are eligible to receive a vaccination from the [Campus Health COVID-19 Vaccine Clinic](https://health.arizona.edu/covidvaccine). Students and employees can call [520-621-9202](tel:%20520-621-9202) to schedule an appointment. Vaccines are also available at [several locations](https://webcms.pima.gov/cms/One.aspx?portalId=169&pageId=669257) throughout Pima County. If you are outside the Tucson area, check [VaccineFinder](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/) for availability in your area. NOTE: You will need to bring a government-issued ID with you to your appointment. International students may use any government-issued ID from their home country (e.g. driver's license, passport, ID card, etc). If you have questions or need assistance, please send an email to [covidhelp@arizona.edu](mailto:covidhelp@arizona.edu?subject=) or call the COVID Ambassador Team (CAT) Hotline at 520-848-4045. How will I know if a program is cancelled? Study Abroad will contact students directly with updates via email. If you have not been informed by Study Abroad that a program you have applied to has been cancelled, you should assume that it is proceeding as planned. Visit the [Study Abroad website](/study-abroad) for updated program status. Should students purchase trip cancellation insurance and/or refundable airfare for upcoming terms? Study Abroad strongly advises program participants to purchase fully refundable airline tickets and a Cancellation for Any Reason (CFAR) and/or Interruption for Any Reason (IFAR) insurance policy after they are committed to their program to safeguard against losses or penalties in case of withdrawal from the Program for any reason (including failure to obtain a visa, travel restrictions related to COVID-19, or any other reason), or in case the Program is cancelled or its dates are changed. Please read the terms of any policy closely before purchasing so that you understand the provisions, limitations and exclusions of the coverage. Please check with a Study Abroad Coordinator before purchasing airline tickets. If you choose to purchase airline tickets or trip insurance, be sure to read the policies thoroughly to make sure they meet your needs. Study Abroad assumes no responsibility for any losses or penalties as a result of cancellation or withdrawal. Will my study abroad insurance cover COVID-19 related expenses? Study Abroad enrolls all study abroad participants in GeoBlue emergency medical insurance for the duration of their program. For information about COVID-19-specific coverage, visit the [GeoBlue website](https://about.geo-blue.com/crisisalert/covid19-group-members).
