As we reflect back on FY 2022, one theme continues to shine through: LLUH is committed to listening, growing and working together to make the Inland Empire a safer and healthier place to live for our families . In 2022, we launched our first -ever formal ized investment process resulting in awards totaling $670,000 for 19 community partners. We continued to grow our Community Health Workers (CHW) workforce in specialized fields (i.e. mental health, black infant health , schools, etc.) . We expanded our Jard \u00edn de la Salud as a safe outdoor space for families, secured outside revenue to support Medi -Cal enrollment and vaccine equity through pop- up clinics , and increased educational support for at -promise youth in our region. You MATTER and we want you to know that each of these initiatives are a testament to t he community we are building together. At LLUH we contin ued to focus on our core investment areas: w orkforce development and improving community heal th and wellness . This particular focus allowed the Institute for Community Partnerships (ICP) , as the a cting arm of our community investment strategy, to thoughtfu lly and strategically think through innovative ways to expand our services beyond the walls of our four licensed hospitals. E ach of the initiatives found in this Community Benefit R eport further advance our institutional mission of \" continuing the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ.\" Finally, this year -end reflection of FY 2022 is a celebration of our community partners hips . This year we had the privilege of working with over twenty community -based organizations creating positive change in our region. Our partner organizations provided a wide range of perspectives and meaningful work while serving diverse populations (low- income, minoritized, immigrants, youth, unhoused, food- insecure, etc.) across varied geographic regions (High Desert, Coachella Valley, and throughout Riverside and San Bernardino counties ). These organizations' contributions continue to inspire great hope for LLUH and our region. Their activities have strengthened the resilience of our community as we continue to recover from the wide-r anging repercussions of the COVID-1 9 pandemic. We thank all of our collaborators and are honored to work alongside you in fostering healthier to work alongside you in fostering healthier and more equitable communities. 4 Executive Summary Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) is dedicated to caring for the mind, body, and spirit of the people in our community. In FY 2022, we continued to work with our partners to address the health and well-b eing of our region. At LLUH, we believe in the importance of addressing the social determinants of health and strive to meet the needs of today, build on the strengths of our community, and invest in the health of tomorrow. The LLUH Community Benefit efforts are managed by the Institute for Community Partnerships on behalf of our four licensed hospitals. This report highlights accomplishments achieved in the third year of our Community Health Implementation Strategy 20 20-2022 (CHIS), which seeks to address the priority areas identified in the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). In FY 2022, L LUH committed to working with partners to: Strengthen workforce development and e ducation: LLUH invested $329,500 in 45 student scholarships and 25 stipends. We also contributed $454,834 to support 15 innovative workforce development initiatives led by community-b ased organiz ations in our region. We expanded our Community Health Worker (CHW) teams at LLUH from 3 CHWs in 2020 to 8 in 2022. CHWs intervene to lighten the burden of the social determinants of health in our patient population through community peers who are expertly trained in recognizing and navigating system barriers that lead to inequity. We also increased support for high need families by expanding our school-b ased Community Health and Education Worker team from 7 to 11 CHEWs, who provide home visitation, linkages to resources, and informal/peer support. Build gre en spaces to foster community engageme nt and access to healthy food: LLUH invested $75,100 in the community garden El Jard\u00edn d e la Salud for capital projects, ongoing maintenance and support for 30 active family plots. This community garden located in the heart of San Bernardino was created during the first year of the pandemic (2020). This symbol of resiliency brought real food relief and a safe space for physical activity to the community. During FY 2022, it became a central hub for the disbursement of 543,728 pounds of fre sh produce. Increase acce ss to mental health resources for vulnerable populations: LLUH invested $100,000 in treatment scholarships for low-i ncome community members who lack access to intensive outpatient behavioral health care programs. LLUH also supporte d 9 community- based partners implementing mental health initiatives. Provided access to health care and services for underrepre sented populations: Effectively managed an external grant that assisted 1,480 uninsured clients in applying for Medi-C al and provided over 97,780 individuals with information regarding Medi-Cal benefits, eligibility, and how to apply. We also collaborated with community partners to provide 430 COVID-19 vaccine doses at 11 pop-up vaccine clinics.5 Enhancing Community -Partner Investments and Relationships: LLUH made significant investments in our partner organizations through direct financial awards, investments in capacity- building, and in -kind contributions of resources to support the operations of local partners who serve our primar y community benefit populations. We launched our 1st Annual Community Health Investment Awards (CHIA) process this year, investing $670,000 in 19 local community -based initiatives seeking to improve health equity. LLU H's total community benefit investment totaled $195,198,173 in FY 2022. This report is the story of FY 2022 and LLUH's relevance and responsiveness within and beyond the walls of our four licensed hospitals. We invite you to learn more about LLUH's community benefit programs, services and impac t in the following pages. 6 Major Initiative Partners in FY 2022 7 About Our Health System Our History 8 Patient Care Highlights 9 A Centralized Community Benefit Model Four Licensed Hospitals. One Community Benefit Implementation Strategy . Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) system uses a unique best -practice model for implementing community benefit s in order to maximize the collective impact of our investment programs: Since 2012, all licensed hospitals within the LLUH system have centralized the implementation and reporting of their community benefit investments through the Institute for Community Partnerships to better align and implement their community health investments. LLUH report s programmatically at the health system level to better coordinate and enhance communit y b enefit strategie s. Co mmunity benefit expenditures are reported annually and separately on each licensed hospital's 990 Schedule H . They are based on the individual hospital s financials with attentive management to both the collective and individual programs, activities, and outcomes reported in the annual system community benefit report, in compliance with the ACA (2010) an d C alifornia's AB 204 (2019) . Thi s centralized model allows the hospitals to improve the efficacy of the Community Health Implementation Strategy (CHIS) for implementing programs and collaborating with partner organizations. 10 Institute for Community Partnerships (ICP) The mission of ICP is to ensure LLUH remains relevant and responsive to the community. The Institute works strategically with our regional partners to better address community needs . ICP implements the LLUH -operated community benefit programs and provides the research component necessary to better target health system interventions for under -resourced communit y populations . The Institute oversees the Office of Community Health Development to ensure strategic investments with partner organizations and c oordina te the reporting of community benefit outcomes on behalf of LLUH. This model prioritizes LLUH's focus on the social determinants of health and improved access to care for vulnerable populations. 11 Our Community Investment Community Benefit Accounting Categories Community Benefit is reported according to four major categories subdivided into different types of activities on each hospital's IRS Form 990, Schedule H. C ommunity Benefit investment dollars are also reported programmatically in this report by priority area and outcome in fulfillment of LLUH's current implementation strategy. While all expenditures are reported per fiscal year, programs and outcomes reporting may span multiple years. ICP and the hospital finance teams review all community benefit categories as well as program and operational costs to ensure cost accounting expenses incurred are reported per licensed hospital in this annual community benefit report. In addition, programs and outcomes may have offsetting grant revenue that is N OT included in the Community Health Benefit financials. For purposes of Community Benefit reporting, ICP has on ly reported its cost above the grant in its hospital C ommunity Benefit dollars. NOTE: Program s that include this asterisk (*) in the title are funded primarily by external grants, but may include countable costs such as staff time, non- grant funded expenses or other qualifying expenses per Community Benefit guidelines. 12 FY 2022 Community Investment 13 14 Identifying Community Needs Every three years, LLUH completes a comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessmen t (CHNA) as required by state and federal law. The CHNA assists LLUH in identifying the most pressing unmet health needs for community members in our hospitals' service region encompassing both San Bernardino and Riverside Counties . It serves as t he foundation for prioritizing and selecting LLUH's Community Health Implementation Strateg y to be enacted over the following three years . These findings serve as our \"North Star\" in addressing unmet community health needs and promoting greater regional health equity . About the Community We Serve LLUH is a Level One Trauma Center and key safety -net provider for the Inland Empire . The Riverside -San Bernardino - Ontario metro politan area is expected to grow from 4.6 million to 7.2 million people by 2050, which will make it one of the top 10 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. T he region currently faces severe problems with health disparities and poor health outcomes , which could be exacerbated by rapid population growth i f left unaddressed . San Bernardino and Riverside Counties span over 27,000 square miles, representing more than 16% of California's total landmass. The two counties are home to some of the most diverse peoples in California, with Latinos representing a maj ority of the population. 15 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment The 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) provided a detailed analysis of both the most pressing health needs and inherent strengths of the communities served by Loma Linda University Health. To better understand the community, the assessment was based on a community- first approach, with a total of 1,339 people from the surrounding Inland Empire participating in surveys and community conversat ions (focus groups). Over and over again, th is assessment revealed the daily difficulties people face d in affording essentials such as housing and food . The primary social determinants of health included access to living -wage jobs, food security, safe green spaces, affordable housing, and health care. The top health needs identified were: behavioral health, asthma, diabetes, and various lifestyle -related conditions. The most unanticipated need identified by th is assessment was that 1 in 3 people shared feeling s of being isolated. Although the intent of a CHNA wa s to identify needs, the methodology used was a needs - and asset- based approach. At the core of the assets identified lies t he resiliency of Inland Empire residents . Of the many encouraging community conversations documented, people told us again and again that they desired greater community interaction and there was a strong sense of hope for the future. The resounding message of the 2019 assessment was that we truly are healthier when we work together as a community. 16 The 2020- 2022 Community Health Implementation Strateg y The primary and second focus areas for the 2020 -2022 Community Health Implementation Strategy (CHIS) are Workforce Development and Health and Wellness, as indicated in the summary below. To read the full CHNA & CHIS reports, please visit: https://lluh.org/about -us/community - benefit/reports -and-resources 17 Targeting the Social Determinants of Health While our community investments are primarily f ocused on Workforce Development and Health & Wellness, the hospitals' collective impact extends to working across all social determinants of health. 18 SDOH Priority Populations 19 Community Benefit Implementation FY 2022 The summary below provides an update on progress made toward health equity goals from the FY 2020 - FY2022 Community Health Implementation Strategy . Workforce Development Initiatives Throughout FY 22 , LLUH sought to address the primary focus area of work force development and education , a foundational root cause of poverty in the regio n. These initiatives included providing scholarships to adults, youth, and people from marginalized or special ly targeted populations. This investment resulted in the disbursement of 32 scholarships, 25 stipends, and $246,000 into the hands of at- promise youth in the region that transitioned into higher education. Funds were disbursed in collaboration with four primary community partner s: Health Career Connections, El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center, Assistance League of Temecula Valley and the Making Hope Happen Foundation. In addition, LLUH was committed to supporting students pursuing graduate education programs to become the region's next generation of heal thcare providers . This investment included 13 scholarships totaling $83 ,500 to graduate students representing the fields of Nursing, Allied Health, Behavioral Health and Pharmacy across healthcare graduate programs at Loma Linda University . Investments supported minoritized students from San Bernardino and Riverside County committed to serving our region in the future . Furthermore, this investment was dually leveraged as each graduate program within LLU was required to match all Community Bene fit funded dollars directly to these students or other minoritized students, which essentially doubled our investment in graduate education during FY 22. Finally, LLUH focused on providing investments in workforce development with community -based partners to increase outreach to marginalized and specialty populations. This included investing $454,834 dollars in 15 different workforce development initiatives. Projects included support for nonprofit capacity -building, wraparound services for unhoused individu als, tattoo removal for individuals seeking employment, food distributions to vulnerable populations, emergency services for local community members and youth mentorship, among others. These partnerships with key community -based organizations were vital i n understanding where our investments made the greatest impact. For additional details, see our section titled \" Community -Based Partner Investments FY2022 \". At the state level, LLUH contributed to several initiatives for healthcare workforce and CHW workforce development including The California Endowment Workforce Technical Advisory (2021 -2022), meeting with Sacramento policy staffers (2022), the Mullen Report panel on CA Healthcare Workforce Diversity (2022), and The Children's Partnership Panel on CHW reimbursement bill (AB 2697). 20 Pipeline Programs The LLUH investment in Pipeline Programs seeks to introduce and inspire underserved middle and high school students to pursue healthcare careers and adopt healthy lifestyle s. This investment is critical to increase future representation in healthcare fields for minoritized students in the region. Our pipeline program is an access, equity and inclusion strategy focused on serving at- promise and under - estimated youth in workforce development and poverty reduction. LLUH Investments in t hese Pipeline Programs totaled $60,000 during FY 2022 for the following program activities: Programming for 94 high school students through two My Campus events, which provide d students with interactive workshops that expose them to mentorship opportunities and various schools of health (Nursing, Dentistry, Medicine, Pharmacy, Public Health, Allied Health and Behavioral Health). Programming for 68 students high school students for the Discovery Program (formerly called Summer Gateway and Si Se Puede! ), which was a 2-week opportunity for minoritized students to prepare for college and explore different fields within the health professions. A select group of students was invited to participate in a third week to shadow local healthcare professionals. Goal 4 Health soccer league serving 224 youth and 192 families in the region with a safe outdoor activity that promotes a healthy lifestyle. The Transition 2 Success program * paired 12 San Bernardino and Riverside County youth with mentors in their health discipl ines of interest to provide support and guidance. FY 2022 was the initial year of the program. The La Escuelita program * provide d free academic tuto ring and music lessons to elementary age students from San Bernardino, as well as educational workshops for their parents; 10 children participate d in weekly academic tutoring sessions and 20 in weekly music lessons; p arents participate d in 10 educational workshops during FY 2022 . What do we mean by Pipeline Programs? LLUH has been building a pipeline to higher education to connect local minority and under -served youth to health careers as an access, equity, and inclusion strategy. It aims to expose youth to healthcare careers, provide resources and make connections for future success. This program aligns with LLUH's commitment to education and workforce development as its primary Community Health Implementation Strategy in collaboration with other regional partners. 21 22 23 Community Health Worker (CHW) Workforce Development & Integration Stewarding workforce development for community health workers was a major initiative in the 2020- 2022 CHIS cycle . The goal has been to pilot integration in school districts, hospital systems, and with non-profit partners where CHWs have traditionally not been hired in our region. This strategy aims to use the hospital's investment to intervene and lighten the burden of the social determi nants of health in our patient population through community peers who are expertly trained in recognizing and navigating system barriers that lead to inequity. C HW Health System Integration In FY 2019 LLUH initiated a pilot with three CHWs who integrated into high -risk areas where vulnerable populations access our health system but face undue health burdens in trying to address their health and wellness in either inpatient or outpatient settings. Due to the initial success of the community benefit -funded pilot program in 2019, LLUH formalized the CHW Integration Program through the Institute for Community Partnerships. LLUH's initial investments proved critical to staying at the forefront of the development and processes of CHW integration into health care . The CHW program has secured additional grant funding to support expansion and is well -positioned to incorporate a reimbursement model in the future. The LLUH CHWs are entirely focused on their priority populations, those from underserved communities wh o lack access to services and face poverty. While the CHWs are employed by LLUH, they work in the community with patients and their families who represent the priority populations, as defined by community benefit parameters. LLUH system -employed Community Health Workers support patients from several hospital departments and act as liaison s to ensure access to resources and healthcare post -discharge. The y act as mentors/guides/'navigators' of the health system . Most importantly , they empower and encourage pa rticipants to be their own healthcare advocates and champions , especially during healthcare cris es. CHWs have reached in-need populations through targeted phone calls to families, goal setting, referrals to community resources, motivational interviewing, m entoring/coaching, health system navigation, and were key support s to mobile vaccination clinics. Most of these activities and skills use \"peer -to-peer\" models that allow CHWs to journey with their patients on a level that isn't always accessible and practical for licensed providers. As our regions health needs grew, we expanded our health system CHW workforce from 3 CHWs in 2020 to 8 in 2022. CHWs are now integrated within key areas of the hospital, including: 24 LLU H CHWs focus on home visits and community outreach classes/peer support groups for vulnerable populations with the following programmatic goals: Time is the Medicine - Unlike health care providers and clinical staff, the CHWs are able to provide time -intensive interventions outside the four walls of our hospital and clinical settings. This is accomplished through a trusted relationship as CHWs are able to quickly establish themselves as community peers and engage with community members once they are home. CHWs work with community members and their family members to help them navigate complex social and health systems to address, manage, and maintain their help once these community members are no longer \"current patients\" in our facility, but transitioning back home to get the follow -up and longer term care they may need. Intervention & Accompaniment - CHWs provide supportive coaching and mentoring to help those they work with navigate complex social services and obtain benefits from the DMV, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, etc. and the often l engthy paperwork and processes needed to receive a positive outcome. CHWs are also able to accompany community members to follow -up medical appointments, often seeing the necessity of addressing insidious barriers like lack of transportation, childcare ser vices, or familial support. CHWs are also able to support individuals in accessing essential and urgent resources like food banks, housing and rental assistance, behavioral health, substance use support and other critical resources in the community. Special Populations Focus - The LLUH CHWs are stationed in critical access areas of the health system in order to become connected to community members who are experiencing the highest levels of need. The following are special populations the CHW program w ill address: Individuals in need of mental health or behavioral health resources ; V ictims of violent crime who receive trauma-related surgical interventions ; At-r isk infants and mothers Adults with diabetes Children and youth with diabetes Unhoused individuals in our Emergency Department Individuals experiencing escalation of symptoms related to Sickle Cell Diseases High utilizers of the LLUH system who experience undue social determinant burden andrequire extensive, supportive accompaniment and linkage to health and social services upondischarge from LLUH.25 F inally, special to this program is the triple investment where CHW workforce development helps the CHW, the patients they assist, and the system. Creating CHW jobs is an economic development strategy since CHWs often need the same access to employment as those they are tirelessly serving. Formal employment reduces the reliance on grant -based or project \u2014based employment for CHWs, a source of income insecurity and provides the stabil ity of full -time benefitted employment. In addition to the programmatic outreach and intervention provided by the CHWs, the creation of the jobs for community members who are trained in this work is also a fulfillment of the community benefit workforce development strategy as priority hiring is reserved for people with lived experience in navigating the social determinants of health. 26 27 School Districts - Community Health & Education Workers * Over the past five years, the Institute for Community Partnerships (ICP) at LLUH developed Community Health and Education Worker (CHEWs) teams in local school districts to reach under - resourced and at -promise youth and their families . The CHEW Program operates via a community - academic partnership between LLUH -ICP (technical assistance, oversight, management), El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center (hiring and supervising agency), and school districts (funder and implementation sites). The CHEWs work with school systems to support high need families through home visitation, linkages to resources and informal/peer support. ICP currently contracts with two school districts (San Bernardino City Unified School District and Chaffey Joint Union High School District) and employs eleven CHEW s working in the community, a coordin ator, and a manager to oversee the program. CHEWs conduct interventions with families that may have children who are chronically absent, face undue health challenges, need COVID -19 recovery support (education, access to technology/vaccines/etc.), are food insecure and address the barriers associated with the social determinants of health. ICP's contracts with the local school districts provide workforce development dollars for CH EW integration into school districts with ICP contributing the management time and infrastructure to support the integration and outcomes. Future school sites are intended in the coming years to grow the program and root CHEWs into the fabric of the school district's workforce . Our CHEWs provide sustained and critical outreach to families of school -age youth who suffer undue burdens from multiple social determinants of health risk factors. CHEWs have intervened in the 2021-2022 school year specifically to address: Chronic absenteeism and prevention Home visitation Social determinants of health (Food insecurity, insurance, hygiene kits, etc.) School -site re- engagement Health education through Parent Health Institute (PHI) 28 29 Workforce Development at San Manuel Gateway College In 2016, thanks to a seed investment made by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, the LLUH system was able to build and establish a technical and vocational training college, the San Manuel Gateway College (SMGC), in the heart of San Bernardino. The col lege is co -located with the SAC Health System to provide a community- setting for the training of future healthcare workers. As Loma Linda University (LLU) is a graduate medical education campus with eight graduate schools, the health system recently committed a year -over -year investment to support SMGC operations and extend access to community members seeking vocational and technical training in order to strengthen the pipeline to education in the region. SMGC students also rotate through LLUH's many clinic al settings for training during their programs. In FY 2 022, Loma Linda University Medical Center support ed health professional education operational costs and training at SMGC as an access strategy to address workforce development and education needs o f local youth. LLUH provides operational support to San Manuel Gateway College as part of the commitment to sustain the operations of this critical workforce access strategy. S MGC is developing the health care workforce of tomorrow while providing the bridge to help our community's youth and adults find a path to higher education to set them on a life- long path of career development and economic advancement. Students are provided support from the SMGC staff and faculty given the challenges and life experie nces many of the SMGC students face regarding risk factors related to the social determinants of health. Every year, the SMGC graduates are included in the annual graduation ceremonies and celebrations at Loma Linda University to honor their success and accomplishment and association with a health care system and institution of higher education. For more about SMGC visit the website at: https://sanmanuelgatewaycollege.llu.edu/ 30 Access to Green Space + Healthy Food : Jard \u00edn de la Salud In response to the 2019 CHNA results and identification of a lack of green safe spaces, LLUH created a community garden, Jard\u00edn de la Salud (El Jard\u00edn ), in the heart of San Bernardino. With 30 active family plots growing organic produce on -site, this garden continues to expand and currently has room to grow to a total of 52 family plots. El Jard \u00edn is not only a healthy food access strategy, but also serves as an outdoor community center, fresh produce distribution center, and program site to engage students in community service. It is a highly effective equity effort to bring organic, nutritious food to a food desert area of San Bernardino where the neighborhoods lack access to affordable, healthy produce. The CAPS program as part of ICP oversees the implementation of El Jard\u00edn , which is located at the previous La Escuelita site next to SAC Norton Clinic and the Helping Hands pantry. This garden funct ions to serve families in our community and engages students of LLU and Discovery 2022 participants from local high schools into c ommunity service . CAPS oversight of El Jard\u00edn also promotes this space as a central hub for community health programs such as: Produce Rx: Workshops for local families covering various topics in chronic illness prevention and living a healthy lifestyle. Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Produce Boxes: 64 produce boxes were distributedto community members along with various w orkshops on mental health, gardening, diabetes prevention and many others. Produce Distribution: In partnership with the Inland Empire Health Plan ( IEHP ) and Helping Hands Pantry, CAPS oversaw the distribution of fresh produce for 350- 400 families every Fr ida y f rom January - June 2022. oDuring this time, 543,728 pounds or over 270 tons of produce were distributed. oThis program also engaged 86 community volunteers. El Jard\u00edn has been supported by Community Benefit funding totaling $75,100 in FY 2022 and $96, 560 over the last three years. This has included funding for the partnership with El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center for salaries, ongoing maintenance (trash, porta potty's, etc.), a lighting project, fencing, storage containers, and necessary materials. A dditionally, ICP has allocated staff time to support the implementation, installation, and community engagement in the garden. 31 Access to Health Care & Services for Underrepresented Populations Serving populations with additional social determinant burdens and those who require intentional efforts to gain access to health care is vital to LLUH's mission to \" continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ to make man whole.\" Every year, ICP works with hospital leadership to make sure the programs and services included in the community benefit report are part of \"what counts\" as priorit y needs identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment. Existing hospital outreach and supportive services focusing on improving health care access for underserved population s include : Access to primary, behavioral, and specialty healthcare for low -income individuals through safety- net FQHC providers Medi -Cal outreach and enrollment assistance for the uninsured Community-based COVID -19 vaccine clinics for improve d health equity and access Intervention services to victims of violent trauma Access to behavioral health services Regional alignment on early childhood development screening, intervention, partner coordination, and service integration through Help Me Grow Access for people living with disabilities through the PossAbilities program Resiliency Institute for Childhood Adversity (RICA) to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of childhood adversity Providing patients with whole -person cancer care and access to state and national research efforts through the Cancer Registry . 32 Partnering w ith FQHC SAC Health to Serve Vulnerable Communities* SAC Health is the largest federally qualified health center (FQHC) providers of primary and specialty outpatient care in our region with over 181,000 patient visits in 2022 across 10 locations. The primary and secondary service regions show critical access to care from patients that come from a broad distribution of the two -county region, as SAC serves patients primarily in the East and West Valley regions of San Bernardino and the High Desert, with their secondary service region reaching patients as far as Coachella Valley (Indio Clinic) to the California State line. SAC Health is the FQHC with the most specialty services of any FQHC in the country as a patient- centered medical home for many of the residents living in vulnerable communities. SAC Health is recognized as a Level -3 Patient -Centered Medical Home by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). All physicians are affiliated with Loma Linda University Health, allowing patients to receive world -class care from providers trained in over 35 different specialties. Consistent with its mission and values, SAC Health provides over 900 medical residents and students from Loma Linda University a unique opportunity to serve our most vulnerable population which allows them to continue to be leaders in our community. A s a major LLUH partner in the care of the medically underserved and at- risk populations in our region, SAC Health contributes to our 2020 -2022 Community Health Implementation Strategy in the following areas: 33 Creating \"Health for All\" through Medi -Cal Enrollment Support * Loma Linda University Health - Institute for Community Partnerships was awarded $752,149 in grant s from the San Bernardino County Transitional Assistance Department during FY 2022 to help uninsured San Bernardino County residents enroll in Medi -Cal. Through the \"Health For All\" coalition , LLUH - ICP together with its program partners, El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center, Inland SoCal United Way, and Congregations Organized for Prophetic Engagement (COPE), are transforming the landscape of San Bernardino County with a population who will have improved health outcomes for generations. The target populations for this program are diverse, including people with substance use disorders, mental or physical disabilities, unhoused, seniors, young people of color, immigrants and families of mixed immigration status, those with limited English proficiency, low -wage workers and their families or dependents, and uninsured children. The goal of this program is to connect eligible community members to quality, affordable health coverage from Medi -Cal. From July 2021 - June 2022, over 1,480 applications were submitted for Medi -Cal and over 97,780 individuals were provided with information regarding Medi -Cal benefits, eligibility, and how to apply. Due to State level changes in Medi -Cal eligibility, as of May 2022 individua ls ages 50+ years are eligible for full- scope Medi -Cal regardless of immigrations status. Additionally, mothers can extend coverage for up to 1 year postpartum . The coalition implemented new strategies to provide educational outreach and support for these populations with Medi -Cal enrollment. Two innovative strategies that contributed to the program's success are: Spanish- language radio spots on three local radio stations and Health Navigators stationed at \"hub\" community locations on a consistent schedule. Through both efforts , partners educated individuals and direct ed them to a bilingual call line for one -on-one assistance. 34 Vaccine Equity through Pop- Up Vaccine Clinics * In 2019, few could have imagined the onset of a global pandemic and how lives and communities would be impacted. Relevance and responsiveness are at the core of LLUH's community engagement. During FY 2022, there was continued commitment to serving on the frontlines to help keep the community safe and to turn the tide of this pandemic. L LUH commitment to COVID -19 vaccine equity meant engaging community members where they live and work. Beginning in early February of 2021, LLUH teamed up with trusted organizational partners including the Inland Empire Concerned African American Churches (IECAAC), Congregations for Prophetic Engagement (COPE), and El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center to improve access to life -saving COVID -19 vaccines in minoritized communities that have been hardest hit by the pandemic. Since February 2021, these partners have conducted 39 pop -up vaccine clinics, providing more than 3,800 vaccinations in communities across San Bernardino County. In FY 2022, LLUH administered 430 COVID -19 vaccine doses at 11 community vaccine clinics . LLUH faculty also served as fea tured speakers for over 20 community -focused webinars throughout the pandemic aiming to build vaccine confidence in communities of color disproportionately impacted by the virus. 35 Hospital -Based Violence Intervention Program (VIP) LLUMC and LLUCH are Level -1 trauma centers in the region and frequently provide the emergency and care to victims of crime or gun violence in our region. Trauma surgeons began to notice that gunshot victims were often returning to emergency rooms from multiple incidents in a cycle of violence perpetrated by their life circumstances and their association with local gangs. To begin to provide supportive services to multiple gunshot wound victims and other victims of community violence, LLUMC invests in program managers to support safety outreach and education to prevent injuries based on trends in our emergency department. The program convenes community partners in monthly discussions to address trends and the needs of people at -risk for violence and through a community- informed steering committee, works reduce risk of violence in our community. The Hospital -based violence prevention program works closely with community partners and the CHW in the ED. With Community Benefit funding, this hospital -based violence intervention program has started providing tattoo removal services to patients who are or were gang affiliated and want a new start. I n FY 2 2, the ICP CHW in the Emergency Room continued to partner with the Trauma Prevention Program linked services in order to provide peer -supportive services to victims of violence while they recuperate in the hospital and to support patient's re -entry into the community with supportive services and alternative means for escaping the cycle of violence. 36 Access to Behavioral Health Services Beyond LLU H's programs seeking to reduc e social isolation, additional services provided by Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC) aim to address behavioral and mental health care access barriers . Referral Support Services through Psychi atry Interns LLUBMC sponsors the psychiatry interns in training to help increase access to mental health services for vulnerable populations in the Inland Empire . Program services include conducting psychological assessments, facilitating group therapy sessions at the BMC, leading psycho -education groups, and providing individual consults for patients in the geriatric unit, adult unit, adolescent unit, and the adult partial hospital ization program. This is a non -reimbursed service that provide s extensive referral and support for people who may fall between the gaps in California's tier -based system of care. The PhD Psychiatry Interns served approximately 500 community members during FY 2022. Tr eatment Scholarships for Intensive Outpatient Treatment The LLUBMC invested $100,000 designated for treatment scholarships for low -income youth and adults who lack access to outpatient, intensive care programs. Many of the outpatient intensive programs that treat severe behavioral health conditions or coping behaviors are often not covered by Medi -Cal or are not accessible to uninsured people. The BMC restricted community benefit dollars starting in FY 21 aims to give treatment scholarships to people who are low -income, with a focus on students of color to address equity in access to mental health services. Services include different levels of care such as Partial Hospitalization Program, Intensive Outpatient Programs, and Outpatient services for youths and adults as well as a wide range of mental health treatments like substance use and recovery, eating disorder, chronic illnesses, etc. BMC Treatment scholarships are designed to help patients and their families with transportation and treatment costs that would otherwise be billed to them in order to lessen the financial burden while on their journey to recovery. S tand up to Stigma 5k The Stand up to Stigma 5K walk is a unique community one -day event sponsored by the Loma Linda University Behaviora l Medicine Center (LLUBMC). This event is designed to reduce the stigma of mental illness by encouraging community members to participate in the 5K. Held during May (Mental Health Awareness month), the walk creates community dialogue about mental illness to stand up to stigma. While this program faced a 2 -year hiatus due to the COVID -19 pandemic, it was back in full force on May 15, 2022, and drew 631 registrants who came to support and raise funds for mental health services. 37 Access to Early Intervention & Prevention Services for Children* Loma Linda University Children's Hospital (LLUCH) currently holds a First 5 Grant for the Help Me Grow* (HMG) initiative. HMG helps families, child health care providers, early education providers, and human service provi ders recognize early signs of developmental or behavioral concerns. HMG motivates providers to conduct systematic, standardized developmental screenings of young children and provides them with electronic linkages to improve care across the region for chil dren with developmental delays. When needs are identified, HMG assists in finding programs designed to address those needs by providing parents supportive mentoring to providers and resources. It is an efficient and effective system that builds on existin g resources by improving access to services for families, infants and children ages 0 -5. In addition to developmental screening, HMG addresses the social determinants of health and functions as a vital safety net for parents with young children. In 2022, t he top needs of parents who received assistance from the HMG team were related to finding diapers, formula, and enrollment in food assistance programs (food insecurity). HMG is the only 2 -county collaboration between two First 5's and a health system in California . It represents a pioneering effort to improve the long- term health outcomes of children from across the region. The investment into LLUH's development of a regional platform for providers has been a historic and upstream intervention s trategy. First 5 San Bernardino and First 5 Riverside, in partnership with Loma Linda Children's Health, convened key stakeholders and experts across diverse sectors, including health departments, early intervention and preschool education, and medical providers to engage in the planning of a dual county HMG system model for the Inland Empire. LLUCH is investing resources in leading this regional collaboration , which aims to improve health and well -being of the children not only served by the hospital, but across the Inland Empire . Between the two counties of the Inland Empire, over 400,000 children ages 0- 5 have the potential to benefit from the Ages and Stages (ASQ -3) screening tools and benefit from referrals and increased provider connectivity in address ing their needs. The program served over 4,000 children through a centralized access point and via providers screening in pediatric practices at Riverside University Health System, Loma Linda University Health, and S AC Health System. In 2023, LLUH will launch the HMGIE community portal on behalf of the First 5's and will bring on to the EPIC portal pe diatric providers, early child educators, and preschools providers. These portals will begin to register and order developmental screenings for parents to complete for their children . This enhances screening, care coordination, and collaborative care among providers who traditionally lack access to electronic referral and care coordination systems for children 0 -5. Additionally, providers will be able to submit electronic referrals to the HMG Access Team for children with monitor or concern scores in order to provide follow -up supportive services. Making the LLUH Epic platform available to LLUH physicians, non -LLUH physicians, and other providers of care for children in early start programs is one way LLUH is operating above and beyond the standard of care f or people in our region. Linkages provided on behalf of children enrolled in the program will help all providers in responding to critical and preventative interventions early in children's lives. 38 Resiliency Institute for Childhood Adversity (RICA) * In May 2018, Loma Linda University Health launched the 13th LLUH Institute, the Resiliency Institute for Childhood Adversity (RICA). RICA was created to improve awareness of the need for long -term trauma- informed pediatric medical services and to make these s ervices available to the larger population of vulnerable children within our community. How RICA Addresses the Needs of Vulnerable Children RICA is dedicated to implementing creative cross -disciplinary medical, mental health, and educational activities inc luding trauma -informed educational programming, mentoring and scholarships for our patient population . The clinic incorporates allied health (speech/occupational/physical therapy), developmental assessments, nutritional assessments, dental evaluations and other sub -specialty care including a monthly head trauma follow -up clinic coordinated with Neurosurgeons on -site. Every patient will receive a mental health screening and will be provided referrals including access to on -site therapeutic services. The phy sical space , supported by Loma Linda Children's Hospital , was designed with the intent of incorporating themes of resiliency. A study conducted by Forensic Pediatrics and the School of Public Health at LLU found that centenarians within Loma Linda's Blue Zone, one of the five worldwide longevity hotspots, ident ified \"Engagement with Nature\" as a resiliency factor that contributed to an increased quality of life in the face of ACEs. The facility at RICA was crafted to bring elements of nature into the space, including large canvases representing one of eight National Parks in each of the eight exam rooms. Children will be given Junior Ranger Passports and learn about the parks when they visit each of the rooms, facilitating rapport building with providers and inspiring children with hope for the future and a desi re to return. The space includes: A large waiting area 8 examination rooms 3 suites designated for : oPlay therapy oSand tray therapy oArt therapy oGroup/caregiver engagement therapeutic sessions. A nursing station Laboratory space A vaccination room Space f or student/resident A nutritional area for both staff and patients Finally, RICA is committed to build ing a network of care providers across the county to expand these services throughout the region. 39 Access for People Living with Disabilities: PossAbilities * PossAbilities is a FREE membership -based community outreach program developed by Loma Linda University Health whose goal is to provide resources and support to anyone with a permanent physical or intellectual disability and veterans.

The se objectives reflect the importance of promoting and optimizing evidence -base d screening for cancers including lung, cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer. For all cancers with evidence -based screening tools, early detection must include the continuum of care from screening to appropriate follow -up of abnormal test results and re ferral to cancer treatment. L LUH's Cancer Center: Services Provided Loma Linda University Cancer Center is a critical access point for specialty care in cancer services and a unique health asset in the Inland Empire, allowing community members to heal and undergo cancer treatment close to home.
