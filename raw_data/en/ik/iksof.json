What does Australia's vaccination timeline look like? And where will you get yours? By [Mary Ward](/by/mary-ward-h0fwto) Ayear to the day since Australia's first coronavirus case was diagnosed, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced [a vaccine against the virus had been approved for local use](/link/follow-20170101-p56wko). After more than 29,000 cases and 909 deaths, the federal government has promised the Australian adult population will be vaccinated against COVID-19 at hospitals, specialist hubs, GP clinics and chemists by the end of October. In an undertaking described by Department of Health secretary Brendan Murphy as \"the most complex logistical exercise that perhaps we've done in public health in this country\", the federal government is leading state and territory health departments in a mammoth inoculation operation. What does Australia's vaccination timeline look like? And where will you get yours? Here is what we know so far. Who is being vaccinated first? Australians aged 16 and over are being vaccinated against COVID-19 in at least four - and possibly five - phases. That's more than 24 million people able to receive their jabs, in total, over eight months. The first innoculation was of 84-year-old Jane Malysiak on February 21, which started Phase 1a of the rollout. This phase was made up of people either at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or at a higher risk of becoming very sick if they do: so, quarantine and border workers, frontline healthcare workers, and staff and residents at aged care and disability facilities. There are about 678,000 people in Phase 1a across Australia. By March 14, there had been 164,437 vaccinations. Already underway is Phase 1b: all other healthcare workers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 55 and other Australians over 70 who are not in aged care, younger people with an underlying medical condition and emergency and some critical workers. That adds up to about another 6.1 million people. Australia is aiming to have 4 million people - all of Phase 1a and more than half of Phase 1b - vaccinated by the end of April. Most Australians will have their vaccine in either Phase 2a (the remaining Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, other Australians over 50 and other critical and high-risk workers) or Phase 2b (everyone else aged 16 and over) using the AstraZeneca vaccine. If the Therapeutic Goods Administration approves a vaccine for use in children (more on that later), Phase 3 of the rollout will see children under 16 vaccinated. Proof of vaccination will be recorded on the existing Australian Immunisation Register which can be accessed [via MyGov or the Express Plus Medicare mobile app](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56zv7). Which vaccine will you get? At this stage, Australia's rollout plan is hinged on two vaccines: one by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer and biotechnology company BioNTech, the first doses of which arrived on February 15, and the other by researchers at the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, which first arrived on Australian soil on February 28. \"We have two vaccines, which are effective and safe enough, and that is a long way from where we thought we would be six months ago,\" says Professor Julie Leask, an immunisation uptake researcher from the University of Sydney. Despite early reports that the Pfizer vaccine would be reserved for people in the earliest stage of the rollout, once AstraZeneca doses were made available they were put to use, meaning people in phase 1a and 1b have been receiving either vaccine from early March. The [ Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved the Pfizer vaccine for use in people aged 16 years and over](/link/follow-20170101-p56wko). It comes in two doses, to be given 21 days apart. Australia has bought 20 million doses, including [an extra 10 million secured in early February](/link/follow-20170101-p56ziv), which are being manufactured in Belgium. Clinical trials indicated it would prevent symptomatic COVID-19 in 95 per cent of recipients. The Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, which means it works by giving the body the material that encodes the protein of the virus, rather than the protein itself. Essentially, it shows the body what the virus looks like without actually infecting it, so it can design its immune response. Doses of the Pfizer vaccine need to be imported from Europe and stored in a \"cold chain\" facility at minus 70 degrees, which is part of why they do not form the bulk of Australia's vaccine strategy. The TGA identified some side-effects with the Pfizer vaccine: more than 60 per cent of people will experience fatigue, more than half will get a headache, more than 30 per cent will suffer muscle pain or chills and more than 20 per cent will experience joint pain. But most Australians should expect to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine, which federal [Health Minister Greg Hunt has called the \"ace in the hole\" of Australia's rollout](/link/follow-20170101-p56vvd). The AstraZeneca vaccine is a \"non-replicating viral vector vaccine\": scientists have [ taken a virus that usually gives chimpanzees a cold but is harmless to humans and genetically engineered it to look like SARS-CoV-2](/link/follow-20170101-p55n33), the virus that causes COVID-19, to trigger an immune response. It will need to be stored at 2 to 8 degrees, like most vaccines. This vaccine was approved by the TGA for adults aged 18 and over and will require two doses 12 weeks apart. Phase three trials indicate it has an overall 70 per cent efficacy at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, which is about on par with the average efficacy of the annual influenza vaccine. Australia will have 53.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine: 3.8 million imported from overseas and 50 million manufactured by Melbourne-based biotechnology company CSL under an agreement, beginning at 1 million doses a week. Professor Leask says that although the AstraZeneca vaccine has slightly lower efficacy rates than Pfizer's, its worth is in how much easier it will be to transport and store. \"It's not just about whether the vaccine is quite effective or very effective, it's also about whether you can reasonably deliver the vaccine to a country with a huge land base,\" she says. It should also be noted that no one who took part in clinical trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine developed severe coronavirus or died, leading health authorities to conclude it has 100 per cent efficacy against severe cases of the virus. While Australia has based its strategy on the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccinations, we also have two other vaccine agreements: one for 51 million doses of the Novavax vaccine, being made in several locations across Europe, and another 25.5 million doses of a mix of vaccines under the international COVAX distribution program, which aims to provide fair global access to vaccines once they are made available. Phase-three trials of the Novavax vaccine showed 89 per cent efficacy in preventing COVID-19 after [early data indicated it may offer even greater protection against coronavirus by having an effect on transmission](/link/follow-20170101-p56vbb) as well as symptomatic infection. If all of these agreements come through, Australia could have access to about 150 million vaccine doses. There are also some vaccines going through approvals processes overseas that Australia does not have any agreements for - notably the Moderna vaccine, which is being rolled out in the UK. Where will you be vaccinated, and by whom? The Pfizer vaccines have been administered at up to 50 hospital hubs with ultra-cold freezers in metropolitan and regional areas across Australia. NSW Health [had its initial Pfizer vaccination hubs at RPA, Westmead and Liverpool hospitals](/link/follow-20170101-p56xjk), but is now vaccinating with the Pfizer and AstraZeneca at Hornsby, St Newcastle, Wollongong, Coffs Harbour, and Wagga hospitals. In Victoria, Austin Health, Barwon Health, Monash Health and Western Health host vaccination hubs. Abroad, there have been [scenes of vaccinations in cathedrals and community halls](/link/follow-20170101-p56ws5) but, once it's their turn in the rollout, most Australians will be vaccinated at their local GP or pharmacy. There have been 4600 GPs approved to administer the vaccine, with people from vulnerable groups in phase 1b able to make appointments at 1000 GP clinics from March 22. Appointments can be made through the National Booking Service, or a GP registered to administer the vaccine. Every health professional administering the vaccine must complete an online training course developed by the Australian College of Nursing. In the aged care sector, residents are being vaccinated by private staff providers contracted by the federal government at their facilities: Healthcare Australia is providing vaccines to residents in NSW and Queensland while Aspen staffs vaccinations for aged care in the remaining state and territories. Who is not being (or should not be) vaccinated? The Pfizer vaccine has not yet been approved for children under the age of 16. Pregnant women have been [advised against receiving the Pfizer vaccine by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists](/link/follow-20170101-p56wxc). This is because the clinical trials the TGA based its approval on did not involve pregnant women. Australia is not experiencing high case numbers and there is no evidence pregnant women are at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, which provides clinical advice for vaccines, is yet to release official guidelines for the vaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding women against COVID-19. The TGA says the decision to vaccinate people with the Pfizer vaccine who are very frail or at the end of their life will be made on a case-by-case basis, after a [small number of deaths were observed in this population in Norway](/link/follow-20170101-p56uoh). Similar advice has been issued for use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in over-65s. Are we giving vaccines to other countries? Part of the appeal of manufacturing the AstraZeneca vaccine in Australia is being able to then provide doses to other Pacific nations. Before local production of AstraZeneca had been finalised, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on March 17 Australia would be [\"moving immediately\" to donate 8000 doses of vaccine stocks to Papua New Guinea](/link/follow-20170101-p57bf7) in light of rising cases in the country. Will you need to be vaccinated again? Flu vaccines come out every year because the virus varies from one season to another, so will you need to be vaccinated against coronavirus after you have received your two doses in 2021? The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines both generate much higher levels of immunity than infection, [leading scientists to believe they will cover a number of variants](/link/follow-20170101-p56wy9). Preliminary evidence suggests the more transmissible and dangerous variants of coronavirus from the UK will be covered by the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. However, very early trial data has [suggested the AstraZeneca vaccine offers only minimal protection against the South African variant](/link/follow-20170101-p570dr), prompting South Africa to suspend its use. \"Even though this new variant has multiple mutations, only 1 per cent of this protein is changed. And that means 99 per cent are still the same,\" says BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin of the Pfizer vaccine, in relation to the UK variant in a December interview. It should be noted these will not be the last variants of the virus and updates to the vaccines may need to be made. With Bevan Shields, Liam Mannix, Melissa Cunningham and Rachel Clun This explainer has been updated several times since it was first published on January 29. clarification A line in this article, about children under the age of 16 potentially being vaccinated in phase three of the rollout, if a vaccine is approved for use for them, was initially included under a section on Pfizer. Given the limited number of Pfizer doses purchased by the Australian government, it is unlikely this will be the vaccine offered to children under 16 during phase three of the rollout.
