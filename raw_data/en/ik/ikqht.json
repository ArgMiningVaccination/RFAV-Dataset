Our lives are experienced through our senses, we have eyes to see, ears to hear, a nose to smell, our heart to love. Do we love with our heart? Perhaps, but it is not the large muscular organ with four hollow chambers that experiences love. It is our soul, our spirit, our essence that experiences love and connection. Yes, we see with our eyes, hear with our ears and have an olfactory sense connected to our nose. Yet, their is no reason to limit ourselves to these physical senses. Much of the world believes in experience beyond our physical body; call it heaven or the afterlife. Many of us believe a part of ourselves lives on when our body returns to the earth. If we can experience life beyond our bodies then, perhaps, we are not limited to experiencing life now only with our physical senses. In my experience, life is beautiful both in its beauty and pain. I like to experience it as a gift from above. I am most grateful for the connection. The connection we have with each other, our Earth and the light that is all around us...but more importantly the light within us. Unfortunately, we limit ourselves for many reasons and life may not always feel as full or as bright as you would like it to be. Maybe you are content or even sad, yet know life can be so much more. Well, I'm here to tell you it can! And, nothing needs to change. Just open yourself up. We came here knowing innocence, trust, openness. We came here with this ability to experience more. It was trained out of us by life experience but there is always the chance to unlearn and remember. The opportunity to open up can present itself in many forms. Listen to your feelings, your intuition will guide you. As you begin to open your mind and your heart to all that is already around you, the barriers will melt away and you will be free to see, hear and feel from your soul. Just listen.
