WHAT DO I NEED FOR 3 HOMEMADE CLEANERS WITH ESSENTIAL OILS? - Reusable spray bottle (we prefer glass, but plastic is okay) - Mixing utensils - Measuring spoons and cups - Distilled water - Medium container Looking for ideas to make reusable spray bottles? Recycle any old bottle you may have, or check out this approachable [tutorial](https://livesimply.me/make-your-own-glass-spray-bottle/). WHAT ARE ESSENTIAL OILS? Essential oils are concentrated liquids derived from various botanicals. These oils are often used in aromatherapy, which is the therapy of utilizing certain fragrances to encourage calming effects on the mind. Not only are essential oils used in cleaning products, but they are often diffused around homes and added to soaps and perfumes. Some concentrates are known to have antiviral and antibacterial properties, such as eucalyptus, tea tree, bergamot, peppermint, and cinnamon leaf oil. ARE ESSENTIAL OILS NEEDED FOR THESE 3 HOMEMADE CLEANERS? Although essential oils are highly recommended for natural cleaning products, but they are not necessary! No worries if you cannot find any oils in your home because these cleaning products are just as effective without them. When we cannot seem to find any essential oils, then we usually resort to some of these ingredients as fragrances for homemade cleaners: - Rinds of oranges, lemons, limes, or grapefruits - A few sprigs of rosemary, thyme, lavender, or eucalyptus If using the items above, then simply mix with the other ingredients for cleaning and store in spray bottle until ready to use.
