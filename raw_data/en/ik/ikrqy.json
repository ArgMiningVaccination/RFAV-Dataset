If you've recently been prescribed KEYTRUDA, the quick start guide for KEYTRUDA gives you step-by-step information to help you prepare for your treatment, become familiar with possible side effects, and more. KEYTRUDA is not chemotherapy or radiation therapy\u2014it is an immunotherapy and it works with your immune system to help fight cancer. KEYTRUDA can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become serious or life-threatening and can lead to death. You can have more than one of these problems at the same time. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended. Nurse: I'm Jane Arboleda, Oncology Nurse, and I'm going to explain how immunotherapy works in the body. Over the years, your body has helped to fight off thousands of invaders\u2014colds, infection, flu, even cancer\u2014but not always. Why is that? Well, sometimes one particular immune system cell known as a T cell needs help to recognize cancer. Your immune system sends T cells throughout your body in search of invaders to attack. But certain cancer cells can flip a switch in what's known as the PD-1 pathway, enabling them to hide from T cells allowing cancer cells to multiply and spread. Here's where one specific type of immunotherapy, called KEYTRUDA, may help. KEYTRUDA doesn't attack cancer cells directly. Instead, it blocks the PD-1 pathway, to help prevent cancer cells from hiding, allowing the T cells to attack. Male Narrator: KEYTRUDA is a prescription medicine used to treat a kind of bladder and urinary tract cancer called urothelial carcinoma. It may be used alone when your bladder or urinary tract cancer has spread or cannot be removed by surgery, and you have received chemotherapy that contains platinum, and it did not work or is no longer working. Nurse: KEYTRUDA helps your own immune system do what it's designed to do: find and fight cancer. Male Narrator: KEYTRUDA can cause your immune system to attack healthy parts of your body during or after treatment. This may be severe and lead to death.
