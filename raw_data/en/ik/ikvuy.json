Purpose: In an effort to further understand vaccination decision making, this study examined factors adult decision makers take into consideration when deciding whether or not to have children vaccinated. Methods: This project used a descriptive design to explore the effects that dissemination of evidence-based knowledge regarding vaccines has had on adult decision making to adhere or refrain from the recommended pediatric immunization schedule. A non-random, convenience sampling method was utilized to obtain participants by an online ad via Facebook advertisement. Demographic data was obtained, and participants had the option to provide narrative responses regarding vaccine decisions. Results: The results of the study demonstrate the presence of various factors which influence parent and adult decision makers' decision to follow or refrain from the recommended pediatric immunization schedule. Influencing factors include but are not limited to number of children in the family, education level, religion, and information from resources such as a healthcare provider, friends and family, the internet, and research articles. This study also showed that parent and adult decision makers fear vaccines for a variety of reasons. Parent and adult decision makers cited fears such as the presence of toxic ingredients, too many shots at once, vaccines being ineffective, and side effects or vaccine injury. Discussion: This study demonstrates the need to educate parent and adult decision makers with unbiased, evidence-based information regarding vaccines, regardless whether they adhere to or refrain from the recommended pediatric immunization schedule. Conclusions: This study provides a distinctive reflection on immunization practices among parents and adult decision makers. This study calls for nurses and providers to make an effort to identify and provide knowledge to families and children who choose to deviate from the recommended pediatric immunization schedule or completely forgo immunization to address a main source of under immunized children in a sensitive manner. Future studies should focus on minority groups, people of color, ADM for those greater than 26 years old (i.e. special needs adults and dependent elders), and utilize different strategies to recruit participants.
