The expectation is that this document will serve to guide current and future programs of naturopathic medical education. Introduction 1Naturopathic Medicine is a distinct primary health care profession that combines the traditions of natural healing with the rigors of modern science. Naturopathic physicians are trained as primary care providers who diagnose, treat and manage patients with acute and chronic conditi ons, while addressing disease and dysfunction at the level s of body, mind and spirit. They concentrate on whole patient wellness through health promotion and disease prevention, attempting to find the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Naturopath ic physicians care for patients of all ages and genders. They provide individualized evidence -informed therapies that balance the least harmful and most effective approaches to help facilitate the body's inherent ability to restore and maintain optimal hea lth. A resurgence of interest in naturopathic medicine in North America in the 1970s resulted in rapid growth and maturation of the naturopathic profession to where it is today. As of 2014 there are seven institutions of higher learning offering naturop athic degrees in eight locations across North America. The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) is the accrediting body for these programs. Graduates of CNME accredited naturopathic medical programs receive a Naturopathic Doctoral designation (ND) and are eligible to sit for the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination (NPLEX). The Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges (AANMC) and its Council of Chief Academic and Clinical Officers (CCACO), recognized the need for agree ment among the AANMC member schools on clinical expectations for graduates of CNME accredited naturopathic medical programs. As such, CCACO and AANMC embarked on examination of current clinical expectations and the creation of a unified baseline for clinical competency of the naturopathic medical graduate. In August of 201 2, CCACO agreed to embark on the creation of naturopathic clinical competencies for the accredited institutions. In July 2013, academic and clinical deans from each CNME accredited inst itution met together and developed a draft document, after which time CCACO convened a taskforce of representatives from the accredited naturopathic 1 References: House of Delegates Position Paper, American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (Amended 2011) \"What is a Naturopathic Doctor\", American Association of Naturopathic Physicians Page 5 Introduction medical programs and the executive director of AANMC . This subgroup met regularly for six months , and received input from CCACO, stakeholders and advisors in the broader medical and educational communit ies to create the first draft of the naturopathic clinical competency document . The document then received input from the naturopathic community and final appr oval from CCACO and the AANMC Board of Directors. The following report constitutes consensus on clinical competencies for the naturopathic medical graduate. Page 6 Core Principles Core Principles The practice of naturopathic medicine is guided by six core principles, as defined by American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP). First Do No Harm ( Primum Non Nocere): The naturopathic physician follows three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: Uses methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects; Uses the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; and Acknowledge s, respect s, and work s with individuals' self -healing process. The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): The naturopat hic physician recognizes an inherent self -healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. The naturopathic physician acts to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self -healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (ToIle Causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying cause(s) of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. Doctor as Teacher (Docere): The naturopathic physician educat es patients and encourages self -responsibility for health. The physician also recognizes and employs the therapeutic potential of the doctor -patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person : The naturopathic physician treats each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, the naturopathic physician encourages individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Preven tion: The naturopathic physician emphasizes the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with the patient to prevent illness. The Seven Areas of Compete nce for the Naturopathic Medical Graduate : Medical Assessment and Diagnosis Patient Management Communication and Collaboration Professionalism Career Development and Practice Management System Based Practice Practice Based Learning, Research and Scholarship Page 7 Medical Assessment and Diagnosis Medical Assessment and Diagnosis Naturopathic medical graduate s conduct a complete and accurate history , physical exam and objective assessment, to arrive at a diagnosis .
