Acupuncture is one of those mysterious and curious treatments that originated in the eastern part of the world. The treatment is often misconceived by most people who don't have any idea of what the treatment does. Is it just one of those witch doctor placebo medicine? Well, there's only one way to find out and it's to have a better understanding of the technique. [Acupuncture](https://biorestoration.com/treatments-offered/musculoskeletal/acupuncture/) originated in China. It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine. Back when medicine consisted of herbal components, there were no known treatments and even surgery for medical conditions. Acupuncture was the only treatment procedure available to humankind back then. Chinese doctors have undergone profound study on how the nerves, organs, tissues, and muscles interact. However, that is the latter version of acupuncture. Originally, acupuncture is a technique for balancing the energy flow or life force, thus, chi. Chi is believed to flow internally and externally through the body. Pain and discomfort were and are believed to be a result of an imbalance in the body. It is hard to deny that eastern medicine had huge effects and influence on present medicine. Acupuncture is the ancestor of its descendant, surgical and non-surgical operations. Some people might find it ridiculous; however, if we come to think of it, most treatments involve needles and pins in treating medical conditions and even aesthetic treatments. How does acupuncture work? Doctors and physicians use tiny needles and insert them on specific parts of the body, called meridians. When your body experiences pain and discomfort, it means that your chi is in a state of imbalance. By pushing needles and pressure into the meridians, chi begins to flow into the body, and acupuncture aims to regain the balance once lost. With the conjunction of western influence, the practitioners incorporate western science with traditional acupuncture. Western practitioners focus on the nerve points that affect muscles and connective tissues. Just to give you a clearer view, back then, there were no X-rays. Microscopes are hard to get by. Additionally, experimenting on deceased bodies was forbidden. People did not have sufficient knowledge to call specific organs, tissues, or nerve-endings compared to the world we live in today. It is pretty unbelievable that using needles and inserting them at certain points can treat certain medical conditions. Acupuncture has been believed to treat mild to severe pain and discomfort. It has also been studied to treat certain medical conditions such as: - Gastrointestinal disorders - Respiratory Disorders - Neurological disorders - Poor Eyesight - Urinary and Reproductive Problems and Irregularities - Orthopedic Disorder Acupuncture is also known to relieve discomfort and pain, such as - Osteoarthritis - Dental Pain - Nausea and vomiting - Lower back pain - Neck pain - Menstrual Cramps - Labor Pain - Headaches If you come to think of it, nerved endings can be reached by invasion through the skin. Dampened nerve endings cause many conditions, and scientists and researchers continue to discover innovations and technology for treating medical conditions. Many people might think that acupuncture is pure placebo medicine. However, practitioners spend their lifetime studying the practice, and the results are astonishing. If you still doubt the power of acupuncture, check out how the World Health Organization sees the effectiveness and even the medicine's potential.

The most common among them is Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). There's also the Neuro-anatomical, Five Element, and Auricular acupuncture styles. Researchers and scientists are studying acupuncture. They observe the biological response of patients to the needle insertion, both close to the insertion point and at a distance. Results show that acupuncture stimulates the production of hormones in the body. This can explain how acupuncture improves the mood and overall well-being of the patient, as acupuncture is also used for relaxation and rejuvenation. There are also new studies that acupuncture can be used to associate certain mechanics, such as electromagnetic signals and brain blood flow. However, further studies are necessary, and it is yet to be proved. What's the best way to prove that acupuncture works? There's only one way to find out, and that's to try it for yourself.
