Impr ession with and R eflection on China-India R elations (Chinese Ambassador to India Mr. Le Yucheng 's Speech in Jawaharlal Nehru University ) 05/02/2015China India Relations 20 News From China February 2015 Respectable Mr. Sopori, Vice Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University , Ladies, Gentlemen and Friends! Namaste! I am very delight ed to meet with you at renowned Jawaharlal Nehru University . I have been in India for mor e than 4 months. It is not a long time, but I had extensi ve contacts with friends from all walks of life in India. Besides Delhi, I visit ed Ahmedabad in Gujar at, Mumbai in Mahar ashtr a and Jaipur in Rajasthan. By watching Indian TV and reading Indian newspaper everyday, I ha ve int egrated myself int o Indian li fe and begin to enjo y it. During this period, man y vivid and touching stor ies inspir e me to think about India and China-India relations, which I would like to shar e with you on this occasion. 1. I am a very lucky ambassador . Just one week after assuming my new post in India, I had the privilege of welcoming President Xi Jinping to pay state visit to India last September . It has been 8 years since President of China visit ed India last time. Pr esident Xi w as also the first Head of State of a major country whom the new Government of India recei ved at that time. This visit put new impetus into the all-r ound cooper ation betw een China and India, and pushed the China-India Strategic and Cooper ative Partnership to a new height. As a member of the delegation, I participated in all engagements of the visit and witnessed the close inter action between the two leaders, which deeply impressed me. The chemistry was appar ent as Prime Minist er Modi in a rare gestur e welcomed President Xi at Gujar at, his home state. In Gujar at, the two leaders wore Indian traditional Khadi jack ets, visited Sabarmati Ashr am, str olled along the Riverfront Park, swung on the typical Gujar ati Jhoola, enjo yed the folk perf ormances and shared birthday cake in an amicable atmospher e. One of man y impr essive moments was vividly captur ed by local and world media when President Xi tried his hands on a legendry Charkha with Prime Minist er Modi by his side at Sabarmati Ashr am. It has become the symbol of their mutual bonding, and the resol ve that the two neighbors will pick up the threads of our ties, and join hands in weaving them into a beautiful picture of shared dream of friendship and development . President Xi Jinping and Madam Peng Liyuan met and mingled with the people of India. Upon their arrival in Gujar at, hundr eds of thousands of local residents lined the streets where the motor cade passed. Their warm smiles, applauses and greetings deepl y touched President Xi, every member of the Chinese deleg ation and 1.3 billion Chinese people. During her visit to the Tagor e International School, Madam Peng sang Chinese song together with the local students. One of the boys who were kissed by Madam Peng on the cheek became well-known and received numer ous inter views after that . This visit opened a new chapter of the China- India r elations, sent to the wo rld a positi ve signal that China and India, two major neighboring countries, would be sincer e to and trust in each other and join hands in cooper ation. I am lucky to experience and witness this hist orical e vent. I am fully confident about the futur e of our bilater al relations. Curr ently, relevant authorities of our two countries are proacti vely implementing the outcomes of this visit . The year of 2015 mark s the 65th Anni versary of establishment of the China- India diplomatic relations. It is also the \"Visit India Year\" in China. Prime Minist er Modi will pay an official visit to China this year. This visit will be a significant event and will inject new vigor to the development of China-India relations. 2. The friendship betw een China and India is not only reflect ed by the close inter action betw een our leaders and at the official level, but also flourishes in people-t o-people exchanges. Let me shar e with you a stor y of \"blood transmission between Chine se peopl e and India n peopl e\" report ed by Chinese newspapers and websites . At the end of last year, a little girl in Zhejiang Province in easter n China needed blood transmission. Mor e than 100 Indian mer chants ther e voluntee red to donate blood for her. And in 2013, mor e than 80 Chinese people in Zhejiang Province were actively involved in a voluntary blood donation campaign initiated b y the local Chinese authority to sa ve an Indian patient in emergency care. This kind of recipr ocal sacrifice among the common folks of our two countries serv es as the best example of China India Relations21 News From China February 2015 friendship betw een China and India. From a historical perspecti ve, China and India are tw o major neig hbors with the longest mutual contact and deepest mutual influence. The stor y of Xuan Zang, an eminent Chinese buddhist monk who came to India to learn Buddhist scriptur es in the 7th century is a legendary name in China and India. Based on his epic adventur es, a classic literatur e entitled Journe y to the West is well-r ead in China. Another well-known and much- respecte d name in China is Docto r Kotnis, a docto r of the five-member Indian Medical Mission to China. He sacrificed his life by supporting the Chinese people in the War of Resistance against Japan. To enhance the traditional friendship betw een our two peoples, President Xi announced during his visit that China would open a new route for the Yatra through Nathu La Pass. Elabor ate preparations have been undertaken by the relevant authorities of China. The two sides have reached preliminary consensus that the new route will be opened this summer . In a few months, the Indian pilgrimage will be blessed with mor e convenient transportation to Mount Kailash and Manasar ovar. This is another great deed to facilitate the friendl y exchanges betw een our two peoples. The curr ent number of visit ors betw een China and India is only 800,000, a very small number compar ed with our combined population of 2.5 billion. Huge potential remains to be tapped. Visitors between China and other foreign countries of much less population than India have already reached one million and even ten million. I have visit ed a lot of places of inter est in man y countries. All of them are full of Chinese touri sts. A lot of countries are working hard to attract Chinese touri sts by providing Chinese-language tour guides, setting up Mandarin mark s and accepting Chinese yuan at their shops. Last November, President Obama announced to provide multiple-entry visa with maximum validity of 10 years for Chinese touri sts and businessmen during his visit to China. Chinese touri sts w ere mor e and mor e welcomed b y other countries. Yet when I visited Mumbai and Aurangabad days ago, I felt regretted to have seen only a few Chinese touri sts ther e. This year is the \"Visit India Year\" in China and next year will be \"Visit Chinese Year\" in India. We are facing unprece dented opportunities in the bilateral touri sm cooper ation. I hope and belie ve that with joint efforts by the two sides, the number of visitors between our two countries will remark ably grow. 3. Talking about the China-India cooper ation, I would like to shar e the stor y of Jack Ma with you. Mr. Ma is the main founder of Alibaba, new ly-list ed at the New York Stock Exchange. During his visit to India last year, he mentioned in an inter view that Alibaba has had business-to-business relationship with Indian vendors for 15 years. 400,000 Chinese customer s are buying tea and spices from India through Alibaba and around 1.3 million Indian vendors are doing business via Alibaba platf orms. This stor y reflects that the companies of our two countries have a solid business foundation and the development of Chinese companies also provides the opportunity for the Indian businessmen. Hua wei, a Chinese telecom compan y, is a living example of Chinese investment to India. Hua wei, one of Global 500 companies with business covering mor e than 170 countries, has already created mor e than 5,000 jobs in India at present . Its R&D Cente r with 2000- plus posts will oper ate next month in Bangalor e. The story of Huawe i tells us that Chinese companies brought great vitality and opportunities to Indian econom y and China-India economic and commer cial cooper ation has great potential. In 2014, China-India bilater al trade registe red another breakthr ough of US$ 70 billion with growth of Chinese investment to India. President Xi announced during his visit to India that the Chinese side would endeavor to realize an investment of US$20 billion in India in the next 5 years in various industrial and infrastructur e development projects. China now is building two industrial park s in Gujar at and Mahar ashtr a, including a US$1.8 billion investment plan to pow er equipments. It is progressing smoothl y regar ding railway cooperation between our two countries in incr easing speed on the existing railway lines, China India Relations22 News From China February 2015 heavy-haul transportation training, redevelopment of existing railway stations and establishment of a railway university in India. The first batch of the high-le vel Indian officials has been to China to recei ve training in heavy haul. China and India will consider jointl y building a high-speed railway from Delhi to Chennai in the futur e and the feasibility stud y has been initiated. When finished, it will be the second longest high- speed railway after the Beijing-Guangzhou high- speed r ailway. By then, the tr avel time from Delhi to Chennai will be cut from 28 hours to 7-8 hours. It means that passengers will be able to have breakf ast in Delhi and drink high tea in Chennai on the same after noon. The new initiati ves of the Government of India such as \"Mak e in India \", \"Digital India \" and Smart City have inspir ed great enthusiasm of Chinese companies to invest in India. With mor e and mor e Chinese companies visiting India to mak e mark et resear ch, the Chinese embassy has recei ved lots of consulting phone calls from Chinese companies every day. We hope the companies of our two countries could seize the opp ortunities and promote economic and commer cial cooper ation to a new level. 4. Recentl y, I have noticed that ther e were some comments on \"One Belt and One Road\" when reading Indian newspapers. I would like to take some time to brief on it. \"One Belt and One Road\" was initiated by President Xi during his visit to Kazakhstan in September and to Indonesia in October 2013. At that time, I was Ambassador of China to Kazakhstan and witnessed that moment . The strategic concept of \"One Belt and One Road\" aims to provide wings for the soaring of Asia and to provide an open and inclusi ve platf orm for the development and cooper ation of countries along the belt and the r oad. It aims t o connect the Asia- Pacific economic circle and European economic circle through policy coordination, road connection, unimpeded trade, monetary circulation and mutual understanding betw een peoples, to realize mutuall y beneficial win-win cooper ation and create benefits for peoples along the belt and the road. In this sense, the \"One Belt and One Road\" is a magnificent project which contributes to contempor ary times and brings benefits for future centuries. This strategic concept has been well acclaimed and warml y welcomed by the inter national community and curr ently has comes to a stage for pragmatic cooperation with positive response and participation of mor e than 50 countries along the belt and the road. In order to provide financial support for the \"One Belt and One Road\" strategy , China has taken the initiative in establishing the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and announced to contribute US$40 billion to set up a Silk Road Fund. As an important country along the belt and the road, India is an important member of AIIB and New Develo pment Bank of BRICS countries. We belie ve that the \"One Belt and One Road\" will definit ely create mor e opportunities for India 's development . The BCIM Economic Corridor is an important part of the \"One Belt and One Road\". We welcome India to actively participate in building this Economic Corridor and promote the \"One Belt and One Road\" cooper ation, which will benefit our two peoples and the region at large. 5. In the past four month, I had a strong feeling that the vigor of India 's econom y and social development are being reacti vated in an all-r ound manner since Prime Minist er Modi introduced the new policy . What I see now , is a blooming, young and vigor ous country . A few days ago, my colleagues in the Embassy told me that they were very surprised to find the efficiency of the Delhi Municipal Department has drasticall y impr oved. Usuall y, it took half month or even one month to ob tain an appr oval to insta ll a new LNG pipeline in our Embassy . Now it takes only 3 days! And some friends in the Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Commer ce and Industry told me now they have to punch in before work and ofte n work overtime. Even in New Year's Day ther e was no break. Work is hard, but they are more confident and energetic. They are supporte rs and fans of Prime Minist er Modi, and they are greatly influenced and encour aged by Modi's style and speed. During my visit to Mahar ashtr a days ago, Chief Minist er Fadna vis told me that Mahar ashtr a is China India Relations23 News From China February 2015 making efforts to create a mor e pro-business environment for foreign companies by providing them with optional-menu and single-windo w services to cut administr ative clear ance from 2-3 years to 2-3 months. Mean while, I also find that the Swachh Bhar at Abhi yan has made obvious difference in India. To be frank, some places in India did impr ess Chinese people with dirtiness, mess and disor der in the past . How ever, toda y's India is quite different. Now I see the streets in Delhi are much cleaner than before, and the cartoon ads of Swachh Bhar at are posted in almost every corner of Delhi. I took man y pictur es in Mumbai and uploaded them onto Weibo, the Chinese Twitter . My friends are all amazed at the new change in India. Recentl y, I have read a Chinese-v ersioned biogr aphy about Prime Minist er Modi, which tells a legendary stor y about how a tea-sel ler became a Prime Minister. I can't help admiring his outstanding talent and far-sightedness after reading it. I belie ve that , under the leadership of Prime Minist er Modi, India will achie ve new greater progress and realize the dream of national rejuvenation. 6. I lear n that some Indi an friends are concerned about the 7.4% growth of Ch ina's GDP in 2014. And ther e are different views on China 's economic prospects. I think the overall situation of Chinese econom y is stable and impr oved. After 30 years of r apid de velopment , China 's econom y has been ranked second in the world, it is unrealistic to maintain double-digit growth. From high-speed growth to medium high-speed growth, the Chinese econom y has come to a stage of \"New Normal\" . China 's development must transf er from a low level to a high level. To this end, now China is transf orming the economic development mode, adjusting the economic structur e and promoting industrial restructuring and upgr ading. China 's refo rm and development will provide more opportunities for the cooper ation betw een China and India. Just as President Xi and Prime Minist er Modi said, China and India are \"two bodies with one spirit\" and \"When China and India speak with one voice, the whole wor ld will notice\" , we w ould lik e to join hands with India and work together . I belie ve, once the Chinese Dream and the Indian Dream are connected and integr ated with each other , it will gener ate great positi ve ener gy. China and India will lead the economic growth in the region and achie ve common development and prosperity in Asia and realize the Asian Century together . Dhan yavad! Ambassador Le Y ucheng's Int ervie w with Decc an Herald Chinese Ambassador to India Mr. Le Yucheng visited the headquarter of Indian English Newspaper Deccan Herald on February 4, 2015. The Newspaper published the inter view to the Ambassador the second day. The full text is as follow s: How do you view President Xi Jinping's visit to India last year and its significance in taking the China-India Relations to new heights? Chinese Pr esident Xi Jinping paid a state visit to India last September . This was the second state visit by a Chinese President to India in the span of eight years.President Xi was also the first head of state of a major country to visit India after the formation of a new government . President Xi not only took out time from his extremel y busy schedule to visit India but also stayed ther e for three days; this clearly shows that China attaches immense importance to its relations with India. The leaders of our two countries reached consensus on building China-India closer partnership for development, charted out a blueprint for development of our bilateral relations in the next five-ten years and opened up a new chapter for our relationship. During his first stop at Ahmedabad, Gujar at, President Xi tried his China India Relations24 News From China February 2015 hands on a legendry Charkha, enjo yed a swing in a traditional Gujar \"jhoola \" and celebr ated Prime Minist er Narendr a Modi's birthda y. The two leaders established a personal friendship through close inter actions. The scene of thousands of people lining the streets of Ahmedabad to welcome President Xi gave me a long lasting impr ession and is still vivid in my mind. Having had the rare privilege of being appointed the Chinese Ambassador to India on the eve of President Xi's visit , I have witnessed a rapid growth in China-India relations since the visit . Nearly every sphere, including official contacts, local exchanges and civil inter actions, is showing an upw ard trend. I recei ve various Chinese deleg ations visiting India almost every day. They not only visit the capital New Delhi, but also travel to Mumbai, Kolkata, Jaipur and other places. One can say that , President Xi's visit to India has usher ed the bilater al relations in a boom era and took it to an important historical stage. The y ear 201 5 mar ks the 65th anni versary of the establishment of diplomatic relations betw een China and India. Right now the two sides are stepping up efforts to implement the outcomes of President Xi's visit while preparing for a new round of high-le vel visits. We are working hard to expand our bilater al pragmatic cooper ation in order to inject new vitality into the development of our bilater al relations. Amity betw een people holds the key to the sound relations betw een countries. This year is being observ ed as the \"Visit India Year\" in China. Sushma Swaraj, Indian External Affairs Minist er has visit ed China and launched the \"Visit India Year\" . The Indian government will organize a series of touri sm promotion activities in China to expand personnel exchanges betw een our two countries. China is ready to cooper ate with India to promote greater development of the China-India relations in order to take them to an even higher level. I look forw ard to the prospects of the China- India relations with expectation and confidence. How do you view External Affairs M inist er Sushma Swaraj's recent visit and proposed forthcoming visit of Prime Minist er Nar endr a China India Relations25 News From China February 2015 China is ready to cooperate with India to promote greater development of the China-India relations in order to take them to an even higher level. ((Modi to China? Just a couple of days ago, Sushma Swaraj, External Affairs Minist er of India, paid an official visit to China. This visit was her first visit to China since assuming the office last year, to which both sides attached great importance. During the visit , Chinese Foreign Minist er Wang Yi have had an in-depth exchange of views with her on topics such as bilater al high-le vel visits, pragmatic cooper ation, cultur al exchanges and issues of common inter ests and both sides reached a lot of consensuses. It is particularl y worth mentioning that both sides have agreed upon a package plan about the Yatra to the Tibet Autonomous Region of China through Nathula Pass. We hope that this summer the first group of Indian pilgrimages will go through the new route to Kailash Manasar ovar. Indian Prime Minist er Narendr a Modi's visit to China this year is of great importance in our bilater al relations. The two sides are now in prepar ation for this visit . We hope the success of this visit will bring China-India Relations to a new level. Could you please give us an update on the progress in implementation of the MoUs and agreements ink ed b y India and China during President Xi Jinping's visit in Septemb er, particularly on Chinese investment of US $ 20 billion in India over five years and setting up Chinese industrial parks in Gujar at and Mahar ashtr a? It is one of our major tasks to realize the 20 billion USD investments over the next five years in India which were announced during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to India last September . In order to reach this figur e China needs to invest 4 billion USD annuall y on average. It is not a hard task for China when seen in the light that China 's annual overseas investment is above 100 billion US dollars. As we know , during President Xi's visit to India, China and India signed 12 agreements on trade and economic cooper ation, covering fields like industrial park s, railway, cred it and leasing, with cumulative amount of investment and financing of 13 billion US dollars. Mean while, Chinese companies like Hua wei, Alibaba, Xiaomi are incr easing their investments in India. I remember what Prime Minist er Modi told investo rs: \"Ther e is no red tape but only red carpet in India. \" Chinese entr epreneurs see huge opportunity in India and are scrambling to walk on India 's red carpet . Indian entrep rene urs are also optimistic about Chinese mark et. An Indian friend from West Bengal told me that it equall y takes 2 hours by flight from Kolkata to reach Kunming in China and Delhi. It is very convenient for scor es of Indian companies to do business with their Chinese counterparts. I am full of confidence for the futur e economic and trade cooper ation betw een China and India. I came to know that Indian Media and Indian people are keen to know the setting up of the two Chinese industrial park s. Here I would like to give a brief introduction. During President Xi's visit to India last September , China Beiqi Foton Mot or Corpor ation Limit ed and the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation signed an MoU on supporting the setting up of Chinese industrial park in Pune, Mahar ashtr a. The total investment will be 5 billion US dollars in thr ee phases by 2030. It is estimated to create one lakh jobs and an annual output of 20 billion US dollars. As of now , China has laid out 100 million US dollars initial investment and 20% of the land acquisition program has been complet ed. Similarl y, China Development Bank signed an MoU with the Industrial Extension Bureau of Gujar at to set up a Chinese industrial park in Vadodara, Gujarat focusing on manuf acturing electrical equipment . The total in vestment will reach 1.8 billion US dollars by 2025. It will directly create 10,000 jobs and 40,0 00 jobs indir ectly, with an annual output value of 5.2 billion US dollars. China has already China India Relations26 News From China February 2015 made an initial investment of 150 million US dollars and 28% of the land acquisition plan has been finished. The first phase of a transf ormer plant has also been put into oper ation. We hope that on the Indian side, respecti ve state governments will provide as much support as possible for the development and construction of the two industrial park s by offering preferential policies and creating infrastructur e facilities in a timel y manner . Could you please shar e with us the present scenario of China 's economic engagemen t in Bengaluru and rest of Karnataka and South India? How is China planning to augment investment and economic engagemen t with southern Stat es of India? What mor e do you expect from the Stat e Government to facilitat e Chinese investment in Karnataka? China 's economic cooper ation with south India is mainl y taking place in Mahar ashtr a, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Some representati ve projects such as the Chinese Industrial Park in Pune which I previousl y mentioned, Hua wei's new R&D center in Bengaluru and construction and equipment suppl y of the thermal pow er plants in Tamil Nadu amount to billions of dollars in investment . In addition, Chinese railway companies are keen to participate in the metr o rail construction projects in Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and other major cities in south India. The Chinese companies are choosing these south Indian states as investment destinations due to their comprehensive business environment , which include the initiati ve of local government to attract foreign investment , the transpar ency and efficiency of administr ative examination and appr oval, the convenience of land and taxation policies, the quality of supporting infrastructur e and the development level of downstr eam and upstr eam industries. Not long ago, I read a news report that Bengaluru recei ved US$ 2.6 billion in ventur e capital in 2014 and came in fifth in a list of cities globall y. This attests to the growing attention being besto wed on Bengaluru by the global investo rs. It is w orth mentioning that Chengdu of Sichuan Province, China and Bengaluru established sister city relationship in 2013, thus adding a new impetus to the local investment betw een the two countries. As far as I know , the world famous Indian multinational IT consulting and System Integr ation services compan y Wipr o, which is headquarte red in Bengaluru, has established its Strategic R&D Cente r in Chengdu with a focused resear ch on mobile phone oper ating system. Mean while, Hua wei, a Chinese high-t ech compan y has just established its biggest R&D center overseas in Bengaluru. The two compan ies are leaders in their respecti ve fields. They have also worked closel y. Most of Hua wei's Andr oid mobile phone oper ating systems are developed by Wipr o in Chengdu, while Hua wei mobile phones will be designed and developed at Hua wei's Bengaluru R&D centr e. My visit to Bengaluru to attend the inaugur ation ceremon y of Hua wei's R&D center also bears witness to this model of the China-India investment cooper ation. We encour age Chinese enter prises to carry out a wide range of economic cooper ation with Karnataka and the rest of India. We also look forw ard to the local governments for providing as much support as possible to the Chinese enter prises on policy and information fronts, such as the introduction about the upcoming tender s related to infrastructur e and investment projects, and appointment of a special official for the Chinese enter prises to coor dinate on a series of problems like land acquisition, tax and labor encounter ed during the course of investment . How do China and Chinese companies view Prime Minister Modi's 'Make in India' campaign? Is it likely to intensify competition between India and China? Or, can China contribut e to this Mak e-in-India campaign? China and Chinese companies are glad to see the \"Mak e in India \" campaign launched by Indian Prime Minist er, and belie ve that it is an effective strat egy to ensure rapid recov ery of Indian econom y. When I met with Amitabh Kant , Secr etary , Department of Industrial P olicy & Promotion and in-charge of this campaign, I told him that the Chinese government will guide and encour age the China India RelationsChina India Relations 27 News From China February 2015 Chinese enter prises to actively participate in the development of India's manufacturing and infrastructur e secto rs. China started the policy of reform and opening up in 1980s and following the rapid development of its manuf acturing industry has become \"the world's factory\". Objectively speaking, China and India are at different stages of development in the manuf acturing secto r. China 's economic development has enter ed a \"new normal\" state, mainl y mark ed by mid-to - high-speed growth instead of high-speed growth in the past . China 's curr ent goal is to focus on improving the quality and efficiency of the economic development, keep the economic oper ation within a reasonable area, and put the transf ormation of the economic development model and adjustment of the economic structur e in a mor e important position. Thus, in the coming period, \"Made in China \" and \"Make in India\" will not form fierce competition in the inter national mark et. On the contr ary, we belie ve that the \"Mak e in India \" campaign will bring opportunities for expanding economic and trade cooperation betw een China and India. China has capital, technology, equipment and sophisticated manuf acturing management experience. We hope to mak e full use of the \"Mak e in India \" campaign to expand the Chinese investment in India. On the other hand, only with the development of India 's manuf acturing industry and the growth of Chinese investment in India can we fundamentall y bring down the trade deficit and balance the bilater al trade. How do you view Prime Minist er Modi's endeavours for economic reforms and his efforts to mak e the government's policy friendl y to investors? What more do you think Indian Government can do to encour age Chinese companies to invest in India? In the last four months, I have witnessed various steps taken by the Indian government under the leadership of Prime Minist er Modi towards good governance, reform and development . I can myself experience the rapid changes which are happening. I have just been to the financial center of India Mumbai, now I have come to the \"Silicon Valley of India \" Bengaluru, both are so full of vigor and vitality now adays that the new look of India 's development and reform is already visible. China sees India as one of the most important neighboring partners, and attaches great importance to bilater al cooper ation. China and India are two largest developing countries and emerging mark ets in the world, with a huge population of over 2.5 billion. Both countries are going through the crucial stage of national revival and facing the arduous task of ensuring overall development . How ever, the potential for bilater al cooper ation has not been properl y explor ed and our bilater al trade and investment volumes are not commensur ate with the sizes of our respecti ve economies. Both China and India need to join hands and work together to realize the untapped potential to bring tangible benefits to the people of our two countries. Chinese companies are actively \"going global\" . They are the main force to unleash the potential in China-India cooper ation. I came to know that they are looking forward to changes of India's investment environment in three major aspects. First is the visa problem. As of now , most of the Chinese businessmen coming to India can only get single entry visas with the duration of 90 days. The conditions for issuing work visa to skilled workers are also very strict . These not only bring incon venience but also stall the expansion of Chinese enter prises' investment in India. We really hope that in the light of the favorable visa policies adopted by some of the other countries towards the Chinese enter prises, the Indian government can also relax its visa restrictions. Second is the security review . Chinese companies are willing to join the construction of large-scale infrastructur e projects in India. We China and Chinese companies are glad to see the \"Make in India\" cam- paign launched by Indian Prime Minister , and believe that it is an effective strategy to ensure rapid recovery of Indian economy .28 News From China February 2015 do have consider able advantages in the spher es of capital, technology, cost and construction experience, which are in line with the actual demand of India. But we ofte n end up hitting the wall of security review . I wish the Indian government provides equal opportunities to the Chinese companies to participate in a fair competition with the win-win spirit of mutual benefit . Thir d is the impr ovement of the business environment , which include providing favorable policies towards foreign investment , impr oving the transparency and efficiency of the administrative examination and approval, expanding the scope of the policy of one-sto p appr oval, simplifying and impr oving the policies of land acquisition, labor and tax, and impr oving infrastructur e support such as water, electricity and waste disposal. How can India and China boost people-t o- people ties between the two great civilizations? China and India are two ancient civilizations with mor e than 2000 years of friendl y exchanges. The stor y of Xuan Zang (600-664), an eminent Chinese monk who came to India in sear ch of Buddhist scriptur es and stayed in India for 14 years during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) is a household name in China and India. Last year was the 'Year of China-India Friendl y Exchanges' . The two countries held a series of colorful activities which impressed the two peoples deepl y. This year is the \"Visit India Year\" in China. I belie ve the number of touri sts betw een two countries will rise further . I have just been t o Aurangabad and visit ed Ajanta and Ellor a Caves. A view er is invariabl y overw helmed by the beauty of these centuries old ancient treasur es. India also has Buddhist shrines like Bodhga ya. \"Incr edible India \" is very attractive for Chinese touri sts. In order to expand our people-t o-people contacts, the two governments will launch The China-India Cultur al Exchanges Plan this year. Firstl y, the two countries will expand artistic exchange. We will celebr ate the 2015 'Happ y Chinese New Year' by inviting well-known Guangzhou Acrobatic Troupe to perf orm in New Delhi and Gujar at. China will also participate in the Bhar at Rang Mahotsa v in Delhi and the Indian Arts Festival in Bengaluru. Secondl y, both sides are going to strengthen youth exchang es. The numbe r of annual youth visits will be expanded from 100 to 200 in the f ollowing five years. Thir dly, China and India will incr ease cooper ation in the fields of film and television. We will hold film festivals in each other's country . Last year, China participated, as the 'Special Guest Country ', in the International Film Festival of India, Goa. We will invite India as the guest country to participate in China 's film festival this year. Co-pr oduction of films by the two sides is also in the pipeline. I am a big fan of Boll ywood movies. From 'Car avan' to 'Thr ee Idiots' , I am strongl y touched by the charm of Indian movies. Finally, China and India will promote academic, publishing and educational exchanges. We will speed up the project on mutual translation of the classical and contempor ary literary works. China will be the Guest of Honour Country at the New Delhi World Book Fair 2016. Ther e are 22 Chinese teacher s teaching mandarin, calligr aphy and dance in primary and secondary schools all over India. And we are ready to send mor e. I was once invited by my counterpart Ashok Kantha, Indian Ambassador to China, to an Indian Cultur e Festival in China. The Indian dance perf ormances by a group of Chinese teenagers are so wonderful that I initiall y misto ok them as Indians. Yoga is also very popular in China. I wish to see further deepening of the cultural exchanges between our two countries, so that ther e will also be mor e and mor e Indian youth demonstr ating their skills in Chinese Kongfu and calligr aphy. bilat eral trade . Could y ou please shar e with us the measur es taken so far to addr ess the issue of trade imbalance? China 's Centr al Economic Work Conf erence last year clearl y pointed out that China is pursuing a rough balance of inter national payments by promoting the balance betw een domestic demand and external demand, betw een import and export and betw een foreign investment in China and China India Relations29 News From China February 2015 Chinese investment overseas. The Chinese side always prefers trade to be balanced, not imbalanced. China takes the Indian concern of trade imbalance very seriously. Although the main reason of our tr ade imbalance is the difference of industrial structur es betw een our two countries, we are willing to provide opportunities to incr ease India 's exports to China. Since 2008, the Ministry of Commer ce of China has sent 6 trade promotion deleg ations to boost imp ort from India. At the 6th Trade Promotion Matching Session during President Xi's visit to India, entr epreneurs of the two countries signed Indian products procur ement contr acts of 780 million US dollars. We are also preparing to send mor e procur ement missions to India and expand import from India this year. Besides, China war mly welcomes Indian companies to expand trade with China through various effective trading platf orms, such as China- South Asia Expo and China Import and Export Fair (Canton F air). In order t o incr ease the popularity of the Indian products, China also welcomes various Indian chambers of commer ce to hold product promotion events in China. Solving the problem of trad e imbalance requir es joint efforts from both sides. On the other hand, we also need to recognize the upw ard trend of overall China-India trade. The bilater al trade volume has incr eased by 320 times in the last 10 years. China hopes that India would ease restrictions on exporting its competiti ve products such as iron ore to China, reduce tariffs and encour age Indian companies to export mor e agricultur e products. I belie ve that with the development of the Indian manufacturing industry and the impr ovement in inter national competiti veness of its products, India 's trade deficit with China will decline. How does China view new Indian Government's 'Act East ' policy , as well as its renewed focus on engagements in its neighbour hood and, at the same time , New Delhi's unenthusiastic response to President Xi's call for building a 21st Century Maritime Silk Roa d and cautious approach to the proposed BCIM economic corridor? China and India are each other's important neighbours, two major developing countries and new emerging mark ets, and two mainsta ys in the process of world multi-polarization. Both the countries are undergoing the great historical process of national rejuvenation. The harmonious coexistence, peaceful development and cooper ative win-win of the Chinese dragon and the Indian elephant will not only deliver benefits to the 2.5 billion people of the two countries, but also bring prosperity to the developing countries, and will have far-reaching influence over the region and beyond. In this sense, China 's \"21st Century Maritime Silk Road\" initiati ve and India 's \"Act East\" policy can be linked up together so as to contribute mor e to the peace and prosperity of Asia and the world. Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor is an important part of the \"21st Century Maritime Silk Road\" initiati ve. It provides a significant platf orm for the economic development and cooper ation to the countries of the region and also serv es the development of the Indian econom y. Curr ently, the BCIM Economic Corridor is progressing well, the third working group meeting will be held in India this year. China is willing to work together with all parties, including India, to jointly promote the construction of BCIM Economic Corridor, regional integration and economic development . Has ther e been any progress in discussion on the boundary issue after President Xi's visit to India? When can we expect the Special Representati ves to hold the next round of talks on boundary issue? Can any progress be expect ed towards demar cating the Line of Actual Contr ol to avert untoward incidents, when New Delhi and Beijing continue to discuss the boundary issue? The boundary issue is a historical burden left by the weste rn colonists. Through years of efforts, China and India have signed the political parameters and guiding principles for the settlement of the boundary issue.China India Relations30 News From China February 2015 Now , the two sides are working on the basic framework of its solution through friendly consultations. Both sides are keeping close contact for the prepar ation of next round of talks betw een the Special Representati ves of China and India on the Boundary Question. China is ready to work with the Indian side to seek a fair, reasonable and mutuall y acceptable solution on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-exist ence and from the political perspecti ve of the overall bilater al relationship. Pending the final settlement , the two sides should jointl y safeguar d peace and tranquility in border areas and prevent the boundary issue from holding up the overall development of bilater al relations. In recent years, the two sides have properl y handled the boundary issues through friendl y consultations. In this process we have accumulated rich experiences and reached multiple consensuses on how to maintain peace and stability in this area. The two sides signed an agreement on border defense cooper ation, set up regular meeting mechanism betw een the two arm y headquart ers, adjacent military commands and border troops, built additional border meeting points, established a hot line between army headquarters, made telecommunications available betw een front-line border troops etc. A code of conduct for border contr ol is being discussed by the two sides right now . I would like to point out that the connotation of our bilater al relationship is not mer ely the boundary issue but far beyond it. As long as both sides continue to draw wisdom from the two ancient civilizations, keep sufficient foresight, courag e and toleran ce, and expa nd positive aspects of bilateral mutually-beneficial cooper ation, China and India will be definit ely able to find a way to resol ve our differences, and continuall y push forw ard the development of our bilater al relations. How does Beijing view the rene wed efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Government to build civilian and defence infr astructur e close to the Line of Actual Contr ol betw een India and China, including in Arunachal Pradesh? Japan has of late offer ed India support to development projects in North-East and New Delhi seems to have accepted the offer . How does China view this? The China-India boundary has never been demar cated and ther e exists immense dispute in the easter n section of the China-India border. It is a well known fact as well as a basic consensus betw een the two sides. Both sides have always agreed that the boundary issue should not affect the development of bilater al relations. We are curr ently trying to find a fair, reasonable and mutuall y acceptable solution through negotiations. Pending the final settlement of the boundary question, we hope that the Indian side will refrain from taking actions in dispute d areas that may complicate the question. China firml y opposes any unilater al move to change the status quo in the dispute d region, and also opposes the inter vention of a third party because this would complicate the dispute. China is willing to mak e joint efforts with India to take forw ard the process of dispute resolution and contr ol the dispute , to effectively maintain peace and stability in the boundary areas, and to creat e favorable conditions for a final settlement of the boundary issue and development of China-Indian relations. You have already been in India for mor e than 4 months. How is the experience of working with the Indian government and people? I feel greatly honor ed to witness President Xi Jinping's historic visit to India at the very beginning of my tenur e. Participation in the important milest one events in the development of China-India relations gave me a feeling of immense proud. Just after I assumed my post , I paid a visit to President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minist er Modi. In the following four months, I met with External Affairs Minist er Sushma Swaraj and mor e than a dozen ministe rs and high level officials at the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Finance, China India RelationsExternal Affairs 31 News From China February 2015 Ministry of Commer ce and Industry , Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Human Resources Development and other government institutions. I also visited Gujarat, Rajasthan and Mahar ashtr a to inter act and communicate with Indian friends from all walks of life. I recei ved warm hospitality of my India friends wherever I visit ed, and deepl y felt their heartf elt friendship for China and the Chinese people. I'm deepl y encour aged and full of confidence on the futur e development of the China-India relations. China and India ar e tw o lar ge de veloping and neighboring countries. Both take development as their biggest strategic goal and have broad prospects for bilater al cooper ation. I am confident that if w e could further connect our de velopment strategies and respecti ve advantages, the impact would be far-reaching. We would able to lead regional growth and promote development and prosperity in Asia. As Chinese Ambassador to India, I feel a heavy responsibility , because ther e is still a lot of work to be done for achie ving this great goal. In order to promote the China-India relations, I am willing to work together with my Indian friends from all walks of life, and will do my best to take the bilateral cooperation to a new level.

(Xinhua /Liu Weibing ) 37 News From China February 2015 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) \u2014 Visiting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang delivered a special addr ess at the World Economic Forum annual meeting here Wednesda y. The following is the full text of Li's addr ess: Uphold Peace and Stability, Advance Structural Reform and Generate New Momentum for Development Special Addr ess b y H.E. Li K eqiang Premier of the State C ouncil of the P eople' s Republic of China At the W orld E conomic F orum Annual Meeting 2015 Davos, 21 January 2015 Professor Klaus Schwab, President Simonetta Sommaruga, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends, It gives me great pleasur e to come to Davos again after five years to attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2015. Davos is a town of peace and serenity , yet the w orld outside is not tranquil. We need to work together to shape the world in a new global conte xt. I was told that Davos used to be a resort for recuper ation from lung diseases, and the later disco very of Penicillin changed that . Now it is a place for people to gather and pool their wisdom for \"brain-storm\" . Personall y, I find this mor e than relevant, because our world also needs new forms of \"Penicillin \" to tackle new challenges that have emerged. Admitt edly, the world toda y is by no means trouble-fr ee. Regional hotspots, local conflicts and terrorist attacks continue to flare up, posing immediate threats to humanity . Global economic recovery lacks speed and momentum. Major economies are perf orming unevenly. Commodity prices are going through frequent fluctuations. And signs of deflation have made the situation even worse. In fact, man y people are quite pessimistic about the futur e of the world. They belie ve that the guar antee of peace is weak, and the prospect of development is elusi ve. A philosopher once observ ed that we cannot solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them. Indeed, old problems can no longer be solved by clinging to the outdat ed mindset of confr ontation, hatr ed and isolation. Dialogue, consultation and cooper ation must be expl ored to find solutions to new problems. It is important that we draw lessons from history, and pool our collecti ve wisdom to maximize the convergence of inter ests among countries. Fortunatel y, in time of hardship and trial, mankind have always been able to find the cour age to get out of the predicament and move ahead through change and inno vation. In a world facing complex international situation, we should all work together to uphold peace and stability . This year mark s the 70th anni versary of the victor y of the world' s anti- Fascist war. To uphold peace and stability serv es the int erests of all people in the world. The w orld order established after World War II as well as generally recognized norms governing inter national relations must be maintained, not overturned. Otherwise, prosperity and development could be jeopardized. The Cold War and zero-sum mentalities must be abandoned. The \"winner takes all\" appr oach will not work. Regional hotspots and geopolitical conflicts must be resol ved peacefull y through political means. Terrorism, in all its manif estations, must be opposed. China remains committed to peaceful development and regional stability . And China has no intention to compete with other countries for supr emacy . Peace in the w orld must be cher ished the same as we cherish our eyes, so that the achievements and benefits of civilization, including reason and justice, will prevail. In a world of diverse civilizations, we should all seek to live in harmon y. Cultur al diversity , like biodi versity , is a most precious treasur e endow ed to us on this planet . And human society is like a garden where all human civilizations blossom. Different cultur es and religions need to respect and live in harmon y with each other . While maintaining the natur al close ties among those with whom we see eye to eye, we also need to respect those with whom we disagr ee. Like the vast ocean admitting all rivers that run into it, members of the int ernational community need t o work together to expand common ground while accepting diff erences, and seek win-win progr ess External AffairsExternal Affairs 38 News From China February 2015 through inclusive cooperation and mutual learning. In a world facing volatile economic situation, we should all work to promote opening-up and innovation. What has happened since the outbr eak of the inter national financial crisis seven years ago proves that to work in unity is the surest way for countries to get over the difficulties. We are all inter dependent in this world. While we each have the right to adopt economic policies in line with national conditions, we need to strengthen macr o-policy coor dination to expand the convergence of inter ests and achieve com mon developme nt. An European proverb says, \"when the wind of change blow s, some build walls, while others build windmills. \" We need to act along the tr end of our time, firml y advance free trade, resolutely reject protectionism, and actively expand regional economic cooper ation. We need to build global value chains, and seize the opportunity of a new technol ogical revolution. While the inter national community agree on the importance of macr o- policies to the econom y, they also recognize the urgency to go ahead with structur al reform. Structur al reform must be carried through no matter how difficult it is, as it is an effective way to foste r conditions conduci ve to global inno vation and bring about new momentum for global development . Ladies and Gentlemen, I know you are all inter este d in the outlook of the Chinese econom y. Some of you may even worry about the possible potential impact of China ' s economic slow down and transition. To ease your concerns, let me spend mor e time toda y on what is really happening in China. The Chinese econom y has enter ed a state of new normal. The gear of growth is shifting from high speed to medium-to-high speed, and development needs to move from low-t o-medium level to medium-to -high level. This has made it all the mor e necessary for us to press ahead with structur al reform. It must be noted that the moder ation of growth speed in China reflects both profound adjustments in the world econom y as well as the law of economics. The Chinese econom y is now the second largest in the world. With a larger base figur e, a growth even at 7 percent will produce an annual incr ease of mor e than 800 billion US dollars at curr ent price, larger than a 10 percent growth five years ago. With the economy perf orming within the reasonable range and the speed of growth no longer taken as the sole yardstick, the strained supply-demand relationship will be eased, the pressure on resour ces and the environment will be lowered, and mor e time and energy will be devoted to push forward structural reform. That means, the econom y will enter a mor e advanced stage of development , with mor e sophisticate d division of labor and a mor e optimized structur e. If I could compar e the Chinese econom y to a running tr ain. What I want you to know is that this train will not lose speed or momentum. It will only be pow ered by stronger dynamo and run with greater steadi ness, bringing along new opportunities and new momentum of growth. In 2014, we followed exactly the afore- mentioned appr oach. In the face of down ward pressur e, we did not resort to strong stimulus; instead, we vigor ousl y pursued reforms, and the government in fact led these reforms by streamlining administration and delegating pow er. This has moti vated both the mark et and the business secto r. GDP grew by 7.4 percent for the whole year, the best among major economies in the w orld. Over 13 mil lion new jobs were created in cities, with both registe red and surv eyed unemplo yment rates lower than the previous year. That is, we achie ved growth in emplo yment despit e the economic slow down. CPI was kept at 2 percent , lower than the target set at the beginning of the year. These outcomes prove that the host of macr o-regulation measur es China adopted have been right and effective. Mor e importantl y, new progress has been made in advancing structur al reform. Needless to say, the Chinese econom y will continue to face substantial down ward pressur e in 2015. What shall we choose to do under such circumstances? Shall we go for even higher growth for the short term, or for medium-to-hig h gro wth and a higher quality of development over the long run? The answ er is definit ely the latter . We will 39 News From China February 2015 maintain our strategic focus and continue to pursue a proacti ve fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy. We will avoid adopting indiscriminat e policies. Instead, we will put mor e emphasis on anticipatory adjustment and fine- tuning, do an even better job with target ed macr o- regulation to k eep the econom y oper ating within the reasonable range, and raise the quality and perf ormance of the econom y. We are taking effective measur es to fend off debt , financial and other potential risks. China ' s high savings rate, which now stands at 50 percent , generates sufficient funds for sustaining economic growth. Besides, China ' s local debt , over 70 percent of which was incurr ed for infrastructur e development , is back ed by assets. And reform of the financial system is making progress. What I want to emphasize is that regional or systemi c financial crisis will not happen in China, and the Chinese econom y will not head for a hard landing. It must be pointed out that China is still a developing country and still has a long way to go before achie ving modernization. While peace is the basic condition for China ' s development , reform and opening-up along with our people' s desir e for a happ y life constitute the strongest impetus propelling development . The space of development in China ' s rural and urban areas and various regions is enormous, and the country ' s domestic demand will simpl y gener ate great potential of growth. Development at medium-to - high speed for another ten to twenty years will bring even bigger changes to China and create mor e development opportunities for the world. For the Chinese economy to withstand down ward pressur e, and to maintain medium-to - high speed of growth and achie ve medium-to - high le vel of development , we need to sa y \"no \" to traditional mindset. We must encourage inno vative institutions, and press ahead with structural reform. We need to adopt more inno vative macr o-regulation policies and develop a mor e vigor ous micr o econom y. We need to promote more balanced development of industries, betw een rural and urban areas and among regions. We need to ensur e relati vely high employment rate, especially sufficient emplo yment for the young people. And we need to optimize income distribution and raise the people' s welfare. All this certainl y calls for tremendous efforts. Yet we will stay undaunted in the face of difficulties. We will unsw ervingl y press ahead with reform and restructuring to ensur e that our econom y maintains medium-to-high speed of growth and achie ves medium-to -high level of development . To ensur e long-ter m and stead y growth of the Chinese econom y, we need to compr ehensi vely deepen reforms. We need to properl y use both the hand of the government and the hand of the mark et, and rely on both the traditional and new engines of growth. We will let the mark et play a decisi ve role in resour ce allocation to foste r a new engine of growth. At the same time, we will give better scope to the role of the government to transf orm and upgr ade the traditional engine of growth. To foste r a new engine of growth, we will encourage mass entrepreneurship and inno vation. China has 1.3 billion people, a 900- million workf orce, and over 70 million enter prises and self-emplo yed businesses. Our people are hard-working and talented. If we could activate every cell in society , the econom y of China as a whole will brim with mor e vigor and gather stronger power for growth. Mass entr epreneurship and inno vation, in our eyes, is a \"gold mine\" that provides constant sour ce of creativity and wealth. Speaking of this, I think of China ' s rural reform conducted mor e than 30 years ago. The reform brought farmers' initiati ves into full play and allow ed them to decide for themsel ves matters related to rural production and management . Consequently, the problem of hunger that previousl y haunted China was solved in just a couple of years. In short , a structur al inno vation that unleashed the creativity of the people changed the lot of hundr eds of millions in China. I also think of a small village I visit ed two months ago in easter n China. In the village were some 700 households and over 2,800 registe red online stor es. Each day, mor e than 30 million items of various sorts were sold to different parts of the world. The stor y of the village speaks vividly of the External AffairsExternal Affairs 40 News From China February 2015 hard-working Chinese people actively engaged in entr epreneurship. Going forw ard, China needs new sour ces of dynamism to carry development forward. Dynamism comes from diversity , which spark s wisdom and fosters innovation. Mass entrepreneurship and innovation serves to unleash people' s ingenuity and pow er. It will result in greater demand and residents' consumption, greater social wealth, and greater welfare for the people. Mor e importantl y, it will bring opportunity for man y and give people the stage to reach life' s full potential. It will also bring about greater social mobility , equity and justice. Excessi ve regulation discour ages inno vation, and health y competition is the way to pr osperity . We will deepen reform of the administr ative system. This means we will continue to abolish or delegate to lower-level governments items previousl y subject to State Council review and appr oval. We will compr ehensi vely sort out items requiring non-governmental review and appr oval, and put in place a negati ve-list appr for mark et access. This will incenti vize mark et players, and help reduce the possibility of rent- seeking and corruption. We will protect intel lectual property rights in accor dance with the law, and do our best to foste r an environment that encour ages entr epreneurship and tolerates failur e. Mor eover, we will give protection to all sorts of legal property rights. To transf orm the traditional engine of growth, we will focus on incr easing the suppl y of public goods and services. China has made remark able economic achie vements, but inadequate suppl y of public goods and services remains a weak link in development . China ' s capital stock on public infrastructur e, in per capita terms, is only 38 percent that of Weste rn Europe and 23 percent that of North America. The development of its service sect or is 10 per centage points lower than other developing countries at similar development stages. And its rate of urbanization is mor e than 20 percentage points lower than developed countries. This means a massi ve space for incr easing public goods and services. To deliver such public goods and services to impr ove people' s lives is the government' s responsibility . They are also important ways to boost domestic demand. This year, we have identified some key areas for investment , including building railways in central and western provi nces, constructing water conserv ancy projects, rebuilding rundown urban areas and old houses in cities and villages, and preventing and contr olling pollutions. The government will incr ease investment in these areas, and it will not act alone. Efforts will be made to break monopol y and reform the investment and financing systems to encour age the participation of private and foreign capitals. The model of public-pri vate partnership (PPP), Sino-f oreign cooperatives and government purchase of services will be adopted to better leverage various investment sour ces. I have an example here to cite. A few years ago, the plan was made to build a sew age treatment plant in a province in weste rn China, and a total of 335 million RMB yuan was needed. The project later attracted investment from a German water compan y, with the German side contr olling 70 percent of the total shar es. Moving forw ard, we will deepen fiscal and taxation reform, reduce the tax and fees charged to businesses, particularly those in the service secto r, and take new steps to support SMEs. We will deepen refor m of the financial system, continue to promote liber alization of inter est and exchange rates, and acceler ate the development of small- and medium-sized financial institutions, private banks in particular, with a view to developing a multi-tier ed capital mark et. We will speed up reform of the pricing system, substantiall y reduce the types and items for which the government sets the prices, and liber ate price regulation to the maximum extent possible. Mor e emphasis will be given to the government' s role in creating a favorable \"soft environment\" . That means better mark et regulation, a world-class business environment establish ed on mark et principles and the rule of law . In this w ay, we will be able to provide efficient and quality public services to all mark et players. Ladies and Gentlemen, China ' s reform and development will bring mor e business opportunities to the world. We will provide easier mark et access for inbound foreign Chinese Enterprises in India 41 News From China February 2015 investment, and explore the possibility of management based on a pre-establishment national treatment and negati ve-list appr oach. Chinese and foreign companies will be treated as equals. We will further open the financial, education, cultur al, medical care, pension and other service secto rs in an orderl y way, and bring the experience of the China (Shanghai) Pilot F ree Trade Zone to other parts of China. Our aim is to help investo rs from across countries find \"rich mines\" and reap steady retu rns from their investment . What is more, China will explore new appr oaches to investment cooper ation with other countries. China ' s high-speed railway, nuclear pow er, aviation, telecommunications and other sophisticated manufacturing capacities are graduall y being introduced to other countries. They could meet mark et demand of the recipient country , and stand the test of competition on the inter national mark et. Their export will also help open up third-country mark ets, as man y of such products are made by joint ventur es betw een China and a foreign country . China has put forw ard the initiati ves to build the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. China hopes to work with other countries to advance these initiati ves and ensur e that they are brought forw ard in ways that meet the actual needs of countries concerned. Davos of Switzerland is a world-f amous ski resort . As we understand, to be a good skier , one needs to do three things: go at the right speed, keep balance and be cour ageous. I belie ve this also holds true for the Chinese econom y. What is important now for China is to adapt to the new normal. China will maintain medium-to-high speed of growth, keep a proper balance betw een stead y growth and structur al adjustment , and push forw ard reform with great cour age and determination. China will stay firm in its commitment to reform and opening-up. It will focus on structural refor m, encourag entr epreneurship and inno vation, incr ease suppl y of public goods and services, and use the twin engines to ensur e that the econom y maintains medium-to -high speed of growth and achie ves medium-to -high level of development . As long as we succeed in doing so, the Chinese econom y will successfull y overcome the \"middle-income trap\" and move ahead along the path of sustainable and sound development . This will in turn bring greater opportunities to the world econom y. In closing, I would like to call upon the inter national community to forge ahead and work in unison to uphold peace and stability , embr ace harmonious coexistence, and boost the impetus for openness and inno vation. By doing so, I am confident we will be able to overcome whate ver difficulty or obstacle that stand in our way, and bring about a better futur e for the world that we all call home. Thank you very much. CHINESE ENTERPRISES IN INDIA Sinopharm India The healthcare is an important secto r related to national econom y and people's lives.

The terminal, with a total investment of 606 million yuan (98 million U.S. dollars), is seen as a platf orm for goods from centr al Asian countries to go overseas and a boost Economic Affairs 52 News From China February 2015 China 's econom y grew at a rate of 7.4 percent in 2014 amidst its painstaking efforts to carry out structur al reform, cut outdated production capacity and promote inno- vation. \"China has surmounted tremendous pressures and challenges to realize the goal of maintaining its growth rate around the 7.5-per cent target, \" said Ma Jiantang, Commi- ssioner of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), noting that such a growth rate is quite hard-won against the nation 's massive economic aggre- gate\u201463.6 trillion yuan ($10.4 trillion). Although the econom y has shift ed into low gear compar ed with the double-digit growth of previous years, Chinese people have benefite d from the low price level and efficient job creation, said Ma. Accor ding to statistics fr om the NBS and the Ministry of Human Resour ces and Social Security , China 's consumer price inde x (CPI) rose 2 percent in 2014, and a total of 13.22 million urban jobs were creat ed, far e xceeding the target of 10 million. \"The economic envi ronment will rem ain complicated in 2015. Externall y, some developed economies are experiencing a recovery. Domesticall y, uncertainties and contr adictions are inter woven,\" said Ma. \"How ever, ther e are still man y favorable conditions for China to maintain medium-to -high growth in 2015. \" Industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization have laid a solid foundation for the stead y growth of China 's econom y in 2015. As millions of people surge into urban areas, the efficiency of resour ce allocation will impr ove, hopefull y creating greater mark et demand, said Ma. Opening up and reform will continue to stimulate inexhaustible entrepreneurial enthusiasm, which is the main engine of stable growth. Reducing government inter vention and relaxing mark et access will mobilize the 900 million labor and scientific and technical personnel to inno vate and start businesses, said Ma. Enhanced Quality Despit e a slow down in growth speed, a focus has been laid on elevating the quality and efficiency of economic growth. Annual labor producti vity reached 72,313 yuan ($11,647) per capita, up 7 percent from the previous year. Energy consumption per unit of GDP was reduced by 4.8 percent , accor ding to Ma. \"As economic structur al reform advances, and ECONOMIC AFFAIRS Slowdown: A Blessing in Disguise? by Deng Y aqing A worker prints the back of a chair with a 3D printer in Anji, east China 's Zhejiang Province , on January 15 (XU YU)Economic Affairs 53 News From China February 2015 growth model and resources allocation continuously improve, the slowd own seems inevitable, \" said Yu Yongding, an expert with the Chinese Academ y of Social Sciences. Yu offered an example. Mor e than 20 percent of China 's total stee l production capacity is laid idle, and in Hebei Province alone, ther e are mor e than 300 steel mills. Shutting down these factorie s would lead to GDP growth decline, but it doesn 't mean green GDP would drop. Yu's point of view echoes that of Liu Kegu, former Deputy Governor of China Development Bank, who belie ves GDP growth at around 7 percent is what it originall y ought to be, because China used to excessi vely fix its eyes on growth speed rather than quality and people's livelihood. \"Part of the in vestment in jacking up GDP growth should have gone toward eliminating environmental pollution, improvi ng people's living standards, securing employment, or promoting health care and education, \" said Liu. China's economic growth has gradually broken its excessi ve dependence on real estate investment , said Qu Hongbin, chief economist of HSBC in the Greater China region. The construction area of new ly built homes dropped 10.7 percent in 2014 and land purchases made by real estat e de velopers f ell b y 14 per cent fr om the previous year, accor ding to statistics from the NBS. Impr oved Structur e The expanding proportion of the service industry indicates that the service industry is replacing the manufacturing industry to become the main engine of China's econom y, said Ma. The added-value of the service industry accounted for 48.2 percent of the total GDP in 2014, up 1.3 percentage points and 5.6 percentage poin ts higher than the manuf acturing industry; the added-v alue of the service industry gr ew 8.1 per cent , faster than the 7.3-percent growth registered by the manufacturing industry and the 4.1-percent growth registered by the primary industry, accor ding to statistics from the NBS. Qu stated that since the service industry best creates jobs, such an adjustment in industrial structur e will stabilize emplo yment and facilitate ongoing economic reforms. While traditional industries, heavy chemical and bulk raw material s industries struggled with endless difficulties in 2014, emerging industries like mobile Internet gained momentum, impl ying that China 's econom y is aggr essively edging up along the value chain, said Ma. \"The service industry as well as Internet- related emerging industries and hi-tech industries are growing, while high energy- consuming industries are also growing\u2014just at a slow er pace, \" said Ma. Accor ding to statistics from the NBS, the hi- tech manufacturing industry expanded 12.3 percent in 2014, 4 percentage points faster than the growth of value-added output of industrial enterprises; meanwhile, the equipment manuf acturing industry grew 10.5 percent , 2.2 percentage points faster than the growth of value- An urban resident in Lhasa , capital of southwest China 's Tibet Autonomous Region , cleans her home fitted with heating applications on January 9 (LIU KUN) Economic Affairs 54 News From China February 2015 added output of industrial enterprises. In addition, online retail sales incr eased by 49.7 percent , and the volume of express delivery incr eased by a whopping 51.9 percent . While the development of hi-tech industries outpaced that of traditional industries, exports of hi-tech products such as high-speed rails also shot up last year, said Li Kang, chief economist of Xiangcai Securities Co. Ltd. In sustaining the structur al adjustment , Ma argued that enterprises need to constantly impr ove their product structur e and renovate their technol ogies, the mark et should be further freed up to play a decisi ve role in allocating resour ces and the government should resort to structur al and industrial policies as well as macro-control policies. \"The inexhaustible impetus of stable growth consists in entr epreneurial inno vation, \" said Ma. Roadblocks Ahead China 's GDP hit $10.4 trillion in 2014, almost twice t hat of Japan, making it the second country with GDP surpassing $10 trillion. \"Despit e that , the per-capita GDP was roughl y $7,400, ranking around 80th among all the countries on the globe, \" said Lin Caiyi, chief economist of Guotai Jun'an Securities Co. Ltd. China is still a middle-income country and has to overcome the so-called \"middle-income trap\"\u2014an economic development situation wherein a country that attains a certain income gets stuck at that level. As such, it should stimulate mark et vigor through inno vation, tr ansf ormation and opening up to the outside world, said Lin. Zhang Qizuo, Deputy Secr etary Gener al of Globalization Cooper ation Forum, held that the economy cannot sustain over -investment in manuf acturing, real estate and infrastructur e construction, which would only aggravate overcapacity , housing bubbles, local government debt and financial risks. Due to the adjustment of the real estate mark et and the reduction of overcapacity in the man ufact uring industry in recent years, the growth of fixed assets investment has been slowing down. Last year, it only registe red 15.1 percent . Since investment in the manuf acturing industry accounted for over 30 percent of the total, eliminating overcapacity and curbing overlapping investment will inevitabl y result in lower growth of fixed assets investment , said Ma, who admitted that China 's econom y faces great down ward pressur es in 2014 and 2015. When adjusting economic structure and dealing with excess production capacity, traditional manuf acturing enter prises are mor e likely to suffer capital chain ruptur es, which will activate default risks and gener ate bad loans, said Lin. \"Gener ally speaking, when economic growth slows down , the leverage ratio will ascend. Surging leverage ratio reflects enterprises' dwindling capacity to pay off debts, \" said Yu. As an important economic par ameter , China 's CPI grew a mer e 2 percent in 2014. By the end of last December , the producer price inde x (PPI) had seen negati ve growth for 34 consecuti ve months, accor ding to statistics from the NBS. Lian Ping, chief economist of the Bank of Comm unications, noted that the consecutive negative PPI growth has constrained the expansion of the manuf acturing industry and undermin ed the development of the macro- econom y. The decline of CPI and PPI mirr ors weak domestic demand, and the risk of deflation will stretch the endur ance of China 's econom y, said Qu. \"Since the second half of 2014, the prices of inter national bulk commodities like crude oil have plunged, which will further increase the possibility of deflation, \" said Qu. Macr oeconomic Indicat ors in 2014 - Consumer price index (CPI), the main gauge of inflation, rose 2 percent . - Producer price inde x (PPI), which measures inflation at the wholesale level, contr acted 2.2 percent . - Foreign trade incr eased 3.4 percent to $4.3 trillion.

He, like hundr eds of thousands of other Xiaomi worshipers, spends hours every day in testing the user inter face of Xiaomi cell phone, finding bugs and offering advice to the compan y. He is in charge of several sections of Xiaomi's online forum, a platf orm for fans to inter act with the homegr own smartphone vendor , and, every day, ther e are over 200,000 new posts from fans on the forum. Han said his life is Xiaomi-center ed and he has since gotten to know man y new friends through the Xiaomi forum. \"Xiaomi took my advice about creating a folder for private pictur es in its lates t update. This is an honor for me. I really enjo y the feeling of being part of it,\" Han said. Xiaomi, whose name translates int o the grain \"millet,\" was founded in April 2010, in Zhongguancun, Beijing's technol ogy hub dubbed \"China 's Silicon Valley.\" The compan y is very appropr iately named, because it has shown significant growth. Over the past several years, it has risen from an obscur e Chinese handset mak er to become one of the top smartphone vendors in the world's largest handset market \u2014China\u2014with a highl y organized fan base who love and idolize the compan y. Xiaomi is not the only Chinese smartphone mak er that's gr owing e xponentiall y both at home and overseas. Other local brands\u2014Lenovo, Hua wei, Coolpad and Vivo\u2014ar e all also rising into leadership positions held by global leaders Samsung Electr onics Co. and Apple Inc. The competiti ve edge of local brands lies in reasonable prices combined with high-performance hardware and highl y customiz ed softw are. This is very attractive to man y Chinese consumers who try to strik e a balance betw een the price and Economic Affairs 56 News From China February 2015 perf ormance. Accor ding to a recent report from the China Academy of Telecommunication Research, domestic cell phone brands owned 78.3 percent of the mark et shar e in China in 2014.China 's handset mark et is \"unbelie vably brutal. \" Xiaomi is mired in height ened competition with domestic rivals Leno vo and Hua wei. Xiaomi's cr oss-t own ri val Leno vo, the world's largest mak er of personal computers , is focused on an expansion in smartphones amid a global decline in PC demand. After purchasing Mot orola from Google in a $2.91-billion deal in October 2014, Lenovo claimed it has become the third largest smartphone vendor in the world and said the space betw een it and the top ranked smartphone makers is decrea sing. Lenovo announced in January that it will bring Mot orola phones back to China in the first quarter , reintr oducing the brand to the world's largest mark et after an absence of mor e than two years. \"Mot orola's brand is well liked and respecte d in man y mark ets, especiall y being a U.S. brand with a long legacy in mobile\" said Jessica Kwee, a Singapore-b ased analyst with Canalys. \"It is something that Leno vo can leverage.\" In sharp contr ast to Chinese smartphone mak ers' boom, the mark et shar e of Samsung is trailing off. Samsung accounted for 23.8 percent of the global mark et in the third quarter of 2014, decr easing from the 32.5 percent in the third quarter of 2013, accor ding to the International Data Corp. In the Chinese mark et, Samsung's mark et shar e shrank to 14 percent in the third quarter of 2014 from the 21 percent in the third quarter of 2013, accor ding to mark et resear ch and advisory compan y Canal ys. Prominence Xiaomi's rise has been pretty astounding. Just a few years after announcing their first smartphone model in A ugust 2011, it became the third largest smartphone vendor in the world, accor ding to International Data Corp., and the largest in China, accor ding to Canal ys. Xiaomi said it sold 61.12 million mobile phones in 2014, up 227 percent . Sales revenue totaled 74.3 billion yuan ( $12 billion) in 2014, up 135 percent from 2013. The compan y hopes to sell 100 million units of smartphones globall y in 2015. At the end of last year, Xiaomi said it had raised $1.1 billion in a new round of funding, putting the compa ny at a valuation of $45 billion, the highest among all unlist ed tech firms. Despit e its outstanding perf ormance last year, Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi Inc. said ther e is no time for complacence as competition in Smartphone shipments of Hua wei, a leading information and communications technology solutions provider headquarte red in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Provi nce, rose 40 percent to 75 million in 2014. Hua wei's lates t models\u2014Honor 6 and Honor 6 Plus\u2014ha ve made a splash in China and the compan y said sales of its Honor Series, a flagship series that the compan y created to compete against Xiaomi, incr eased 30 times in 2014. Alan Chen, an anal yst with TrendF orce, a mark et intel ligence provider , said in a resear ch note that Hua wei, Xiaomi and Leno vo will battle to Economic Affairs 57 News From China February 2015 be the top Chinese smartphone vendor in 2015. \"How Leno vo's Mot orola acquisition plays out and whether Xiaomi can replicate its home mark et success overseas will be key factors in dete rmining who becomes the top Chinese brand in 2015, \" Chen said. Prospects Wang Yanhui, Secr etary Gener al of Mobile China Alliance, an industrial association in the country , said the victor y of local brands has result ed from their thin profits. \"The decr ease of Samsung's mark et shar e is because the manufacturing technology for smartphones has become standar dized. After Chinese brands have acquir ed the know-ho w, they will definit ely enjo y a sweeping victor y in price- sensiti ve mark ets with their exceptional high cost-perf ormance ratio. If Samsung doesn 't lower its price, its mark et shar e will further decline, \" Wang said. Wang, how ever, said Chinese smartphone mak ers can hardly be expected to dominate the global arena. \"The dominance of Samsung is partly attributed to its strong suppl y chain, and the success of Apple is because of its IOS system. Although Chinese smartphone mak ers have made certain progress in core technol ogies, they still have a long way to go,\" Wang said. \"Their status as top smartphone vendors globall y is back ed by their enormous sales data in China. The global market share of Chinese smartphone mak ers combined is quite limit ed,\" Wang said. \"Hua wei has developed its own patent ed chips, but its suppl y chain lags far behind that of Samsung's. The sales volume of Xiaomi is incr easing rapidl y, but its profit margin is very thin, much lower than Samsung. \" Wang said a lack of global sales netw ork and patents will be major obstacles in the overseas forays of Chinese smartphone brands. For instance, when expanding overseas, Xiaomi started from price-sensiti ve emerging mark ets including India, Indonesia and Pakistan. But even so, the compan y was sued in December 2014 by Ericsson AB for patent infringement when it tried to expand in India, the world's second most populous country . The absence of high-end smartphone models is another reason why domestic mak ers can hardly be expected to compete with Samsung globall y. Chinese smartphone mak ers are mainl y focused on models priced at below 2,000 yuan ($322). \"It's hard to imagine that a smartphone mak er will be a global success without high-end models, \" Wang said. \"If they want to surpass Samsung, they need to do three things first: set up a globalized sales netw ork, solve the patent problem and focus on being the runner up to Samsung, \" Wang. \"T o date, no domestic maker has fulfilled the Economic Affairs 58 News From China February 2015 aforementioned. \" Li Yi, Secr etary Gener al of the China Mobile Internet Industrial Association, said the smartphone mark et as a whole will shrink in coming years. \"Deskt ops used to be popular , but they were replaced by laptops. Several years later , tablets replac ed laptops. Now , the table t mark et is dwindling. Once-popular consumer electr onics products will always be replaced after three to five years, \" Li said. \"The smartphone will be no exception. \" In several years, wearable devices will replace smartphones, and the smartphone mark et as a whole will shrink, said Li. \"Realizing this, global heavyw eights like Apple and Google are all transf orming. Otherwise, they won't have any room for development in the futur e.\" \"Although domestic smartphone mak ers are prospering both at home and overseas, their primetime can onl y last for thr ee to fi ve years. As the technol ogy further advances, smartphones may not exist in the futur e. Its functions will be integr ated into a watch or a pair of glasses, \" Li said. Xiaomi Xiaomi Inc. was founded in April 2010 by Lei Jun and his friends in Beijing. On August 16, 2011, Xiaomi's first smartphone debuted. In 2014, Xiaomi sold 61.12 million mobile phones in 2014, up 227 percent . It hopes to sell 100 million units of smartphones globall y in 2015. Xiaomi's product portf olio has been expanded to cover smartphones, tablets and televisions. Due to Xiaomi's success, Lei was named \"China 's Businessperson of the Year 2014\" by Fortune China. Leno vo Founded in 1984 in Beijing, Leno vo Group Ltd. has become known to the world primaril y as a leading PC mak er. Leno vo bought IBM's PC unit in 2005 for $1.25 billion and has become the world's largest seller of PCs since the thir d quarter of 2013 b y overtaking Hew lett-P ackar d (HP). In April 2010, Lenov o launch ed its first smartphone model. In the third quarter of 2014, Lenovo ranked No.4 in global smartphone shipment , accounting for 5.2 percent of the global mark et shar e. After it bought Mot orola mobile handset business from Google for $2.91 billion in October 2014, Lenovo claimed it ranked No.3 in smartphone shipment volume globall y. By using Mot orola as a springboar d to North American and Latin American mark ets, it plans to sell mor e than 100 million smartphones in 2015. Hua wei Hua wei Technologies Co. Ltd., founded in Shenzhen, south China 's Guangdong Province in 1987, is a leading information and communi- cations technol ogy solutions provider . Its telecom netw ork equipment , IT products and solutions, and smart devices are used in 170 countries and regions. Hua wei took over Ericsson AB to become the largest telecom equipment manuf actur er in the world in 2013. It has invested heavily in smartphones and accounted for 9 percent of China 's smartphone mark et in the third quarter of 2014. Double-Edged S word by W ang Jun Finall y the European Centr al Bank (ECB) decided t o follow the decision of Feder al Reserv e (Fed) to print mone y massi vely. It is uncertain whether the eurozone can brace powerful recovery, just as the United States did after quantitati ve easing (QE), but far away in China, the yuan has been affected . Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Economic Affairs 59 News From China February 2015 announced on January 22 that the ECB would launch an expanded asset purchase program. Under this program, the combined monthly purchases of public and private secto r securities will amount to 60 billion euros ($68 billion). The pr ogram will most likely be in effect until the end of September 2016 and will in any case be conducted until the inflation rate is close to 2 percent over the medium term. This means that, altogether, ther e will be nearl y 1 trillion euros ($1.13 trillion) in the mark et. The euro fell sharpl y after the ECB unveiled such a big QE program, falling to an 11-y ear low of $1.13 on January 22. Driven up by the eurozone's QE, the central parity rate of the yuan strengthened by 1,409 basis points to 6.9795 against the euro on January 23, the biggest daily rise si nce No vember 2011 and lower than 7 yuan for the first time in history, accor ding to figur es from the China Foreign Exchange Trading System. The launch of QE by the ECB, together with the U.S. normalizing its monetary policy , will lead to a stronger U.S. dollar , which may impose down ward pressur e on the exchange rate of the yuan against the U.S. dollar , said Pan Gongsheng, Vice Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country 's centr al bank, at a press conf erence held by the State Council Information Office on January 23. Yuan Under Pr essur e Accor ding to a report by Minsheng Securities Co. Ltd., acceler ated QE by centr al banks of Europe and Japan will further depr ess the exchange rates of the euro and Japanese yen; with strong economic recovery and weakened easing measur e by the Fed, the U.S. dollar will become stronger . After the launch of QE by the ECB, the yuan 's centr al parity rate weakened by 95 basis points to 6.1342 against the U.S. dollar on January 23, accor ding to the China Foreign Exchange Trading System. The yuan 's rate against the U.S. dollar continued to slump for a second trading day on January 26, hitting the lowest level since June 2014. The yuan faces depr eciation pressur e against the U.S. dollar , but with inter vention from the PBC, the depr w on't be t oo significant . Further , the yuan exchange rate against the U.S. dollar may have two-way fluctuations. In the meantime, since the yuan is unofficiall y pegged to the U.S. dollar , it will accelerate appreciation against other curr encies. \"The European version of QE will bring mor e capital to China, while the expected rate hike in the United States may bring depr eciation pressur e to the yuan, \" said Deng Haiqing, chief anal yst of CITIC Securities Co. Ltd., when inter view ed by National Business Dail y. \"Under various pressur es, it is still uncertain if the yuan will appreciate or depr eciate. \" Accor ding to Deng, the depr eciation of the euro and the appr eciation of the U.S. dollar will both affect yuan 's exchange rate, and it is still uncertain the yuan will appr eciate or depr eciate. Since the PBC announced an inter est rate cut on November 21, 2014, the yuan has depr eciated rapidl y. The PBC figur es show ed that in December 2014, the funds outstanding for foreign exchanges Economic Affairs 60 News From China February 2015 fell by 128.91 billion yuan ($21 billion) from the previous month, the biggest monthl y fall since December 2003. Deng said the sharp fall of funds outstanding for foreign exchanges may be due to the PBC's inter vention to alleviate the yuan 's depr eciation pressur e. \"Judging from this, the Chinese centr al bank is reluctant to see the depr eciation of the yuan, \" he said, adding that the yuan 's depr eciation may impede the process of developing the Shanghai free trade zone and making the yuan an inter national currency . It is not logical that China tries to spur exports by depr eciating its curr ency . A report on the Economic Information Dail y said that the European QE could intensif y the competiti ve depr eciation of global curr encies. The yuan will also face more depreciation pressure, but the depreciation won't be significant , and it may appr eciate against other curr encies. Lu Zhengw ei, chief economist of Industrial Bank Co. Ltd., holds different views. Accor ding to him, the effective exchange rate of the yuan is not at an equilibrium level now , and it has long been overrated. This is also the basic reason why the Chinese econom y has not been able to r ecover as quickl y as expected. If the overrating can be modified\u2014thr ough yuan 's depr eciation\u2014China will easil y resume economic growth above 7.5 percent . Lu has a bold estimation that the yuan will depr eciate as much as 5 percent this year. Impact on China Since the scale of this round of QE is much bigger than expected, the euro is likely to continue depr eciating in the short term, str engthening the U.S. dollar . As the yuan is unofficiall y pegged to the U.S. dollar , appr eciation of the U.S. dollar will also push up the yuan 's exchange rate against other curr encies, imposing pressur e on China 's exports. In the long term, how ever, economic recovery in the eurozone will incr ease China 's exports. In 2014, the EU remained China 's largest trading partner . Trade v olume betw een China and the EU amounted to $615 billion in 2014, up 9.9 percent , according to data from the General Administr ation of Cust oms. Among the total, China 's exports to the EU totaled $371 billion and its imports from the EU totaled $244 billion, up 9.4 percent and 10.7 percent , respecti vely. \"The program will help boost the eurozone's econom y, incr ease demand and potentiall y boost China 's exports, because Europe is one of China 's most important trading partners, \" Pan said at the conf erence. The European QE is likely to further boost investors' confidence and devalue the euro. Devaluation of the euro and decline of oil prices will intensif y the pressur e of import ed deflation in China. To addr ess the possible risks of deflation and the pressur e on economic growth, the PBC may further relax its monetary policy , predict ed the Economic Information Dail y report . It is expected that the Chinese Government will adopt relax ed or diversified monetary policy tool s to ensur e stable economic growth. Mean while, the eurozone's QE will further undermine the euro's position as the world's second largest reserv e curr ency . On the other hand, thanks to the yuan 's stable exchange rate, China 's high growth speed and large economic scale, its curr ency is expected to be accepted by mor e inter national investo rs. The ECB's bond-bu ying plan will release a huge amount of liquidity , which will weaken the euro and force capitals to flow out and return to the United States. \"The large liquidity brought forth by the new round of QE in the eurozone will no doubt cause a spillover effect, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar's exchange rate will drive capital back to the United States. All this will incr ease the uncertainty of the inter national capital flow ,\" said Pan. The Economic Information Dail y report said that China may also recei ve some of these capitals. When the yuan 's use as a global curr ency incr eases, the euronzone's QE is likely to bring new opportunities for the inter nationalization of the yuan.Culture & Life 61 News From China February 2015 It's on a Frida y night. Over 100 audience members casuall y sip tea while taking in the perf ormance of a comedic dialogue showca sing the traditional Chinese linguistic art known as xiangsheng, or crosstalk. Li Kuan, a 28-year-old cros stalk perfor mer, and his partner engage in snapp y inter actions with the audience while poking fun at one another . Li seizes everybody's attention when he starts to imitate the aria of a famous P eking Oper a master . A ringtone blaring pop music suddenly interrupts proceedings. Unperturbed, Li Kuan ignor es it and finishes his improvisation. \"See, although the music accompaniment was wrong, my rhythm was still quite accur ate, rig ht?\" He jokingl y remark s to the audience. Li Kuan is representative of the new generation of crosstalk performers. In this gener ation, both perf ormers and audiences have varying opinions on this perf orming art. But this is nothing new or especiall y alarming: The form has a long history of evolving with time. Performance Anxie ty Crosstalk's history can be traced back to hundr eds of years ago. It began as a folk art involving singing and talking that originated in north China. Initiall y, crosstalk was perf ormed by a sole actor . By the early 1910s, it developed basic perf ormance patterns. It can be staged as a single-person monologue, a two-person dialogue or requir es a greater numb er of skills. Performance skills can be divided into four categorie s: talking, imitating, telling jokes and singing. This art form has attained popularity , particularl y in north China, owing to its ability to elicit giggles from audiences\u2014e ven radio audiences\u2014instantl y, and show case the unique charms of the Chinese language. \"Crosstalk has gone through different periods of devel opment,\" senior crosstalk performer Meng Fangui said to Beijing Review . He recalled that in the 1980s, crosstalk experienced a period of blossoming. Man y crosstalk master s emerged and rose to prom inence with their various popular w orks, said Meng. With the dev elopment of TV programs showcasing variety entertainment, crosstalk became a kind of enter tainment mainl y broadcast on TV instead of CULTURE & LIFE The V itality of a T raditional Art by Ding Ying Li Kuan (left) and his partner perform in a Beijing theater .Culture & Life 62 News From China February 2015 being perf ormed live as it had traditionall y been. It w as not until the 2000s that the form enter ed a new period of renaissance. Meng pointed out that TV is a double-edged sword for crosstalk. On the one hand, TV has popularized this perf orming art, and opened it up to a whole new audience who is for various reasons unable to attend live show s, Meng said. On the other hand, the time constraints inherent in TV broadcasting negat e the essence of a form that engages audiences in this manner , he added. \"Although this doesn 't affect crosstalk's performance skills in an artistic sense, it destroys the complet eness of a crosstalk piece, \" said Meng. Gener ally, a complet e crosstalk piece should have an intricate structur e comprising dozens of minutes of perf ormance. Actors deliver the punch lines of their jokes in accordance with the audience's reactions and the dictates of comic timing. \"When a crosstalk piece is short ened into a segment of a TV program, it has to omit a lot of the content it should include,\" Meng explained. \"Besides, people have so man y enter tainment options now and their attention spans have short ened. \" In 2003, veter an crosstalk actor Li Jindou started an initiati ve entitled Getting Crosstalk Back Into Theater s, belie ving this represents the best way to revive crosstalk's fortunes as a perf orming art. Since then, watching crosstalk in small theaters has become somew hat a craze in Beijing. E very y ear, a national cr osstalk cont est is host ed by Beijing TV. Meng observ es that younger gener ations have better educational backgrounds than his gener ation did. \"I belie ve they will have a bright futur e. The only thing I would plead of them is to stay away from bad influences such as vulgarity or drugs. Maybe the older gener ation will need to learn from them in the futur e. Crosstalk is an art that has continuall y evolved with each successi ve gener ation, \" Kuan, crosstalk perf ormance is in his blood, having been born into a family of perf ormers in Beijing. \"I have been surr ounded by crosstalk every day since I was born. My famil y, my relati ves and my parents' friends have all related to this art. I have master ed most of the necessary skills without special studies, \" he told Beijing Review . Li Kuan is the appr entice of Li Jindou, who has been a friend of the famil y since Li Kuan was a boy. The obligation to inherit and develop this linguistic art in his gener ation weighs heavily on Li Kuan's mind. \"Underl ying its jokes, traditional crosstalk has a hidden set of rules guiding perf ormances that on the face of it, seem to be random. A successful crosstalk must have a core around which actors adopt various kinds of skills, \" Li Kuan explained. \"But man y of toda y's crosstalk pieces have a loose structur e. They taste like fast food instead of a well-cook ed dish. \" In June 2014, Li Kuan founded a crosstalk club named Kuanhe Teahouse. This club perf orms on average 15 times a month in four different small theaters in Beijing. The club has 50 regular performers, including five famous senior perf ormers. But it can sometimes play host to 70 perf ormers, because man y crosstalk master s like Meng will give special perf ormances at Li Kuan's Senior crosstalk actor Meng Fangui (second right) instructs young performers backstage.Culture & Life 63 News From China February 2015 invitation. \"We are trying to combine traditional perf ormance skills and rules with modern content. In this way, this traditional art can develop into the new era,\" said Li Kuan. He said the club doesn 't aim to mak e a profit but acts as a vehicle to draw audiences to enjo y the charm of traditional crosstalk. Ticket prices for his club 's show s are highl y affordable. Ther e are two different ticket prices, 50 yuan ($7.5) or 100 yuan ($15), based on different seating zones, with drinks included. On occasion, the club even gives out free tickets to attract a greater audi ence . When the cost of renting theaters is subtr acted, the club can pay only a very limit ed salary to its members. \"Our perf ormers are all diehar d fans of this traditional art. Some of them have other jobs, and they come to my club only for the valuable opportunity to perform in a theater an d to attain experience, \" said Li Kuan. His own perf orming partner is the student of a a perf ormer . Traditional crosstalk requir es actors to be able to inter act with the audience and nimbl y adjust their perf ormances through close coor dination with their partners, which calls for ample experience of perf orming live, he said. Song Xiaof eng and Jiang Shaofeng are two young players in Li Kuan's club. They are the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of perf ormers who themsel ves honed their craft under Li Jindou. Song was born in 1990 in north China 's Hebei Province and Jiang was born 1987 in northeast China 's Heilongjiang Province. In the beginning, both of them were merely avid fans of their master s. \"I was obsessed with my master's performances and asked him to teach me as his disciple. But my master requir ed that I spend over a year in different theaters as a free audience member to train my sense of this art first . Then he belie ved I would be a qualified disciple and accepted me,\" recalled Jiang. By day, Jiang is a perf ormer in a large-scale amusement park. He is still a trainee. Song has been perf orming in the club si nce it w as founded. He also has a job at a wedding planning compan y. \"The club has provided precious opportunities for young perf ormers like me. The guidance of those successful crosstalk master s, even on very simple issues, can be of lifelong benefit to us,\" Song said. To Song and Jiang, their dayt ime jobs are merely a way of meeting their everyday needs so they can continue to pursue their true passion of performing crosstalk. Their most fervent desire now is to attain more income from performing crosstalk so that they may concentrate on refining their skills in a performing art with which they have fallen in love.

Today, Hunan's opera traditions have become part of its intangible cultur al heritage, and local oper as continue to develop and evolve. A Rich R epert oire Ther e are 19 major kinds of local oper as in Hunan. These oper as not only reflect the wide variety of cultur al tr aditions in the province, but also have connections to Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and local religions. Hunan 's long-f orm oper as, such as Hunan Oper a, Hunan Kunqu Opera and Qiju Opera, have been influenced by man y of China 's other schools of oper a. However, they have been restructur ed and rebuilt based on local cultur e. Hunan Oper a is popular in east Hunan and the neighboring Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces. It originated during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Originall y, the plays would be love stor ies or based on mor ality tales. How ever, in the 1910s and during World War II, man y new plays were created to call for democr atic revolution and to rise up against Japanese aggression. In recent decades, the local government has tried to revive this tradition by organizing veteran perf ormers in collecting and pres erving the art form 's traditional works. In May Traditional Oper a Arts of Hunan Provinc e by Ding Ying Two performers act in a scene from a traditional Hunan Opera play. Actresses of Hunan Kunqu Opera . Culture & Life 65 News From China February 2015 2006, Hunan Oper a was included in China's first batch of state-level intangible cultural heritage. Now Hunan Oper a has around 700 full- length plays, and a further 500 incomplet e ones. Hunan Kunqu Opera is a particularly intere sting branch of Kunqu Opera. After Kunqu Opera was brought to Hunan from the late 16th century to the early 17th century, performers in the provi nce combined local culture and dialect to form a unique addition to Chinese opera. Qiju Oper a is another form of oper a that Hunan people are proud of. This art form, which originated in south west Hunan 's Qiyang, has a history 400 years longer than that of Peking Oper a. Since its inception, Qiju Oper a has spread to Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region, Jiangxi Province, Fujian Province, Guizhou Province and even northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and influenced local oper as and plays in these areas. Huagu Oper a is a short-f orm oper a that originated in popular folk tunes in Hunan in the 18th century, though it gradually gained popularity in other provinces such as Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan and Shaanxi. Zou Shiyi, a former resear cher with the Hunan Institute of Art, suggested that farmers originall y created the oper a as a form of recreation for the working day. He explained that , Huagu Oper a, whose name translates directly as \"flow er drum oper a,\" usuall y featur es flow ers from different seasons, the farm work of these seasons, and tales based around common folk. Its lyrics are gener ally happ y and humor ous. The brisk dance moves of Huagu Oper a gener ally mimic actions which are part and parcel of rural life in Hunan, such as picking tea, pushing a hand mill and rowing boats. In addition to these better known schools of oper a, ther e are man y minor forms of oper a and stage perf ormances in Hunan like puppetry and shadow plays. Hunan Shadow Play was also honor ed in the first batch of China 's state-le vel intangible cultur al heritage back in 2006. Heritage Pr eserv ation Zou has been study-ing local opera for decades. According to his figures, there are only nine professional Qiju Opera troupes today, 30 percent the number in 1983, and only five of them are able to put on regular perform-ances. The staging of Huagu Opera performances has also waned, with only 11 active troupes left today. Smaller operas may not have a single professional troupe dedicated to them. Moreover, those troupes suffer from a lack of performers and lackluster audience turnouts. To Zou, there must be different protection measures for operas according to their current states. He suggested that the government should encourage the development of operas that have audiences but can't generate a profit. Zou also Performers stage a Hunan Shadow Play show .Culture & Life 66 News From China February 2015 stressed that operas that espouse tradi tional cultural values and are economically viable must give priority to training the next generation of performers. To him, creating new, modern plays instead of insisting on traditional versions is of paramount importance. It was suggested by him that taking influence from foreign operas and other Chinese operas would be helpful to Hunan's local operas. Zou is optimistic about local operas' futu re. In his view , traditional oper as do not lack an audience. Mor eover, the government has paid mor e and mor e attention to traditional oper as. It has set up intangible cultur al heritage protection center s throughout Hunan, which has in turn helped provide capital and perf ormers for traditional oper as. \"Oper a will neither wither , nor die,\" Zou said. To protect local oper as, Hunan Province has also adopted man y measur es to create a good environment for their development , including sponsoring regular performances of local oper as. For example, ther e is a project called \"public theater,\" which provides opportunities to non- professional performers and fans of different local operas to perform in public. The Hunan Government also encourages traditional opera troupes to give touri ng perf ormances in rural areas across the province. Hunan's local operas have benefited from such policies. Hunan Opera, for instance, wen t through a hard time owing to an influx of modern culture a decade ago, according to Z hang Kelang, head of the Provi ncial Theater of Hunan Opera. Back then, it lacked both audiences and performers. Zhang's theater had only 37 performers. \"A full-size Hunan Opera play requires at least 100 participants. We couldn't give a complete performance of a tradi tional play at that time,\" Zhang recalled. Zhang said the theater has received a huge amount of financial support in recent years, and it has invested 9 million yuan ($1.5 million) into new plays and repairing its infrastructur e. The theater has also trained 37 young perf ormers in the past 10 years. \"Now , they are the hope and the future of Hunan Oper a,\" said Zhang.

Tibet T oday 70 News From China February 2015 Editor's note: In Mar ch 2013, A Compr ehensiv e Survey of the E conomic and Social Development of Early 21st Centur y Minorit y Areas in China start ed in Beijing as a special project of the National Social Scienc es Fund as well as an important innov ation program with the Chinese Academ y of Social Scienc es. The minorit y population exceeds 100 million in China, and the deve lopment of minorit y areas relates directly with the building of an all- round better off societ y by 2020 in pursuit of the realization of the Chinese dream. This survey is planned to shed new light on the conditions of all aspects of social-ec onomic deve lopment within these areas and to assist the centr al government in formulating their deve lopment plan. This \"big survey\" has ov er 20 subpr ojects, most of whic h are expect ed to be conducted in autonomous regions like Tibet along with some autonomous counties and ethnic townships. One subproject, a compr ehensiv e survey of the economic and social deve lopment of Lhodr a Count y in Tibet , was carried out by 11 scholars from the Institute of Ethnolog y and Anthr opology at the Chinese Academ y of Social Scienc es, the Institute of Economics at the Chinese Academ y of Social Scienc es, the Tibet Academ y of Social Scienc es, Tibet Universit y, the Party School of Tibet Autonomous Region, and Yunnan Minzu Universit y. In July of 2014, they went to Lhodr a Count y in Lhok a Prefectur e to do fieldw ork and learn the social-ec onomic deve lopment of the count y. They conducted a large number of home visits in the town of Lhak hang and the other townships of Ser, Penpa, and Drari and obtained large amounts of relevant data. Lhakhang is the oldest town in Lhodr a County . It is named after Kongting Lhakhang, a shrine built during the reign of Songtsen Gampo to drive away evil spirits. The shrine has gone through man y vicissitudes in its millennium of existence and still stands in the heart of the town toda y, undergoing a new round of renovation. Every day in midsummer , a continuous stream of belie vers from Qinghai and Sichuan drive a long way here to worship. Ther e are three neighbor hood communities in the jurisdiction of Lhakhang: Lhakhang, Dulu,and Moinqai. The Lhakhang neighbor hood community sits on the easter n mountain slope close to where Lhodr a River and Penpa River meet . 776 people from 226 families live ther e. Humid and densel y foreste d, it is rich in resour ces. Since ancient times, Lhakhang has been known for its high-quality timber and woodwares as well as for being a center of trade and commer ce in southern Tibet . 72-y ear-old P adma Chojor is a local celebrity in the town of Lhakhang. He is a bear er of the national-le vel intangible cultur al heritage known as La yman Chams. During m y trip t o resear ch the small-scale local border trade with Bhutan, someo ne from the neighbo rhood comm unit y recommended that I go and talk to Padma Chojor , who went to Bhutan when he was young and knew the history of the border trade very well.

My famil y has been living here for many gener ations. My wife, Sonam Lhadr on, is 70. She w as born here, but her famil y was not originally from here. Her parents were poor wander ers who were passing by and decided to stay. Lhakhang, which the locals still r efer to as Drupa, is very close to Bhutan, only some 30 kilomet ers away. The two sides have different climates and different products. They have traded with each other since ancient times. The trade link was the Lhodr a river valley, and the main trade season is fall and winter , when the water level is relati vely low, making it easier to build tempor ary bridges across the river. The two sides would both build bridges over the rivers in their countries. It is said that 24w ooden bridges were requir ed if all the roads were to be linked, which would requir e some serious effort. The governor of Lhakhang was responsible for construction on our side, and he usuall y assigned the work to one village. The experienced bridge builders in the village would then start to work. When all the bridges were finished, they would chop down a big tree and drift it down the river. When people on the other side of the river saw the log, they would know the bridges were all ready, and trade could then begin. The bridges at that time were all rather low. Once spring came, the river would rise and crash the wooden bridges, rendering the valley impassable. New bridges would then have to be rebuilt the next fall. \"The members of my famil y were subjects of the Lhakhang Dzong and worked as corv \u00e9e labor ers for the government . I had four brothers and sist ers. My f amil y did o wn some land, but w e were taxed so heavily that we did not have enough food, so we had to trade with the Bhutanese for necessary food supplies. When I was about 7 or 8, I went to Bhutan with my father . We were in a team of five, all of which were relati ves. We walked along the ri ver dri ving the loaded donk eys. Ther e was no fixed trade spot in Bhutan. We just walked along the upper reaches of the Lhunzi Zongguri River looking for buyers with the highest bids. Bhutan then was not unlik e here, with tiny villages of only several houses. The goods we carried were mostl y pulu, hats, dried fish (made from fish caught in the Yamzhog Yumco by the people of Nanggarze, which could be used for medicinal purposes), and butter (the Buddhist Bhutanese do not slaught er livesto ck, only eating pork or lamb after the animals die of old age and almost free of fat, leading to the people not ha ving enoug h fat in their diets), with us sometimes smuggling a little bit of salt. Tibetan salt for Bhutanese rice was a major item in bilateral trade then, but the Lhakhang Dzong had a monopol y on the trade, meaning non-go vernment trade of salt and rice was banned. The goods we took back consist ed of Bhutanese wooden bow ls, wooden boxes, and dyer's madder (used by monks to dye their robes). Sometimes we also smuggled in some rice and corn, but this was punishable if disco vered by authorities. On my first trip, we brought back 25 metric pounds of rice on the two donk eys we loaded with goods. \"Man y Bhutanese came over to trade, too. In winters , mor e than 200 of them would come. The beautiful Lhakhang.Tibet T oday 72 News From China February 2015 Ther e was no trading mark et here, either . The Bhutanese all stayed in the villagers' homes. Ther e were several big traders with close links with the Bhutanese. The sister of the King of Bhutan was also in trade, and she had a partner on this side. Bhutanese mer chants ofte n traveled back and forth betw een Tibet and Bhutan during the trading season. The Khaju monaster y located above our village w as in tr ade, as w ell, and it w as financiall y pow erful. Its monks sometimes went to Assam in India to purchase goods such as silk, satin, and other fabrics. \"In the 1959 Tibetan rebellion, man y people fled the country through here. Later , the military strengthened the bor der contr ol, and ther e was a gradual drop in trading activity. Since the start of the Chinese economic reform, some Bhutanese started to come in the summer again, but in smaller groups than before. I hear d that mor e of them went to the commodity fair near the Sakhar Guthok Monaste ry in Ser Township. \"In my younger days, I used to be a member of the local militia and a leader of the village branch of the Communist Youth League of China. Later , I worked for 15 years in a pow er station. During my tenur e as a member of the local public security committee, I joined the Communist Party of China. My wife and I are both in our old age and have both retired. We have 3.6864 squar e meter s of land, but we do not do farm work oursel ves. Instead, we lease the land to others on a yearly rent of 500 kilogr ams of wheat , which is mor e than enough for us. For the two of us, our main job is to look after our own orchar d, which is full of apples, peaches, and Sichuan peppers. We do not expect to mak e any extra profit. It is just something for us to do. To be able to see the fruit trees blossom and bear fruit is a wonderful experience. Subsidies granted for policy consider ations from the state account for a big chunk of our income. My wife and I are both veter an CPC members and cadr es (with Party standings of mor e than 30 years), so each of us has a monthl y allow ance of 300Y uan, adding up to 7,200 a year for the two of us. Those over the age of 60 recei ve a monthl y pension of 55 Yuan, making 1,320 for us in a year. Border residents have a yearly allow ance of 1,200, so we also are able to recei ve 2,400 for that .

So, in total we have got, an income of almost 20,000 Yuan, which is enough for us to lead a comf ortable life. \"I have five childr en, two boys and three girls. My elder son is an abbot of the Khaju Monastery; the younger one is a driver. My three daught ers are all married now; their families are doing pretty w ell and do not need our help. My priority now is to teach some young men of the local Layman Chams and mak e sure the art form can be carried forw ard for futur e gener ations. Besides, the village committee and the village Party branch ofte n come and seek our advice on village aff airs. We just tell it like it is. That is what w e can do for the village. \"In recent years, a working group has been staying in the village. They have started various construction projects here after consulting with us, while also promoting government policies. In the first year, they concentr ated on developing courty ard econom y projects. They secur ed a fund of 400,000 Yuan and used it to help villagers by encour aging them to raise cow s, Tibetan chick ens, and Tibetan pigs. In the second year, the focus was on building the rural roads. Since man y orchar ds in the village were on the mountains, fruit could only be moved by yaks or people, and ther e was a big loss of fruit during transportation. Now that a good road is built , we can transport fruit on trucks and tractors . It's faster and mor e efficient . This year, their plan is to build sheds for livesto ck and dig irrig ation canals for orchar ds. These projects are closel y related to the villagers' livelihood and are welcomed b y us all. W e hope policies lik e this can continue. \"Those who have been here all sing praise of Lhakhang's natural beauty . They ador e the green hills and the flow ers everyw here.
