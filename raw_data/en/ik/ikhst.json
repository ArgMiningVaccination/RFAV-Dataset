How should I take daily detox+? Take 2 capsules daily with water or as recommended by your healthcare practitioner. Store tightly sealed in a cool, dry place without direct sunlight. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant, out of an abundance of caution, we recommend consulting your health care practitioner before using daily detox+ or any dietary supplement product. Keep out of reach of children. At what time of day should I take daily detox+? That's honestly up to you! You can take daily detox+ at any point in the day with or without food. Some customers choose to leverage the comprehensive detoxifying support of daily detox+ first thing in the morning, while others fold it into their afternoon or evening nutrition regimen. This supplement is like your personal cellular cleanup crew, supporting your body's detoxification pathways in a holistic and comprehensive way.* Why would I consider or need a daily detox supplement? Detoxification pathways in our body are numerous, essential, and active 24/7, Monday through Sunday. Thus, at mindbodygreen, we don't approach \"detox\" as a sometimes activity or a \"cleanse\", but rather an everyday, critical physiological network and system. Our body's have intrinsic, built-in systems, detoxification pathways and organs, complex antioxidant networks, and actions to support everyday filtering and removal of toxins. To thrive, those detox systems rely on our daily nutrition and lifestyle choices to run optimally, and are bolstered by targeted nutrients, botanicals, and bioactives. Some of these are powerhouse antioxidants that neutralize free radicals and ensure we strike a healthy antioxidant-vs-oxidant balance in the body, while others aid in promoting activity of enzymes integral to detoxification pathways. Still others promote liver and kidney functioning (two major detoxifying organs in our body!). Thus, these active ingredients offer additional support for optimized daily detox maintenance and health. mbg's daily detox+ nutrient + botanical + bioactive complex comprehensively and holistically supports daily cellular cleanup activities (like the your personal \"cleanup crew\" supporting natural detoxification processes and pathways) from biological and environmental stressors for daily resilience and longevity.* What are detoxification pathways in the body? Detoxification is a complex and whole-body process, relying on multiple organs and complex cellular pathways, but the overall goal is clear\u2014 to balance, clean up, or cast out unwanted compounds from the body. The key organs that support detoxification pathways include the liver, kidneys, and skin, as well as respiratory (lungs), lymphatic, and digestive systems. These organs and physiological systems work constantly to flush out toxins and byproducts of the body's everyday processes. Detoxification is often referred to in different phases: phase I, phase II and phase III. These different phases include specific sets of enzymes and cellular reactions that largely work to biotransform substances to neutralize, metabolize, and ultimately transport them to be eliminated from the body. Our bodies have built-in systems to support everyday filtering and removal of toxins, but targeted nutrients, botanicals, and bioactives offer support for these processes. Even at the cellular level, there are daily cleanup activities to remove waste and start fresh (like cellular housekeeping). Not only are detoxification pathways important to buffer us against environmental factors, toxins, and stressors, but also for helping us achieve homeostatic antioxidant-versus-oxidant balance (aka redox balance) in the body on a daily basis. Our detox-supporting formula delivers daily, \"boots-on-the-ground\" actions against free radicals to combat oxidative stress, which has positive, whole-body health benefits.* What's the difference between antioxidant actions, redox balance, and antitoxin support? Antioxidants are unique compounds (e.g., nutrients, phytonutrients, and other bioactives) that inhibit, neutralize, or resolve oxidation. Antioxidants have a leading and critical role in our body combating oxidative stress (i.e., an imbalance of oxidants vs. antioxidant resolution of those oxidants) that can result from free radical or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and accumulation over time. Reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions in our body play essential roles in maintaining cellular function, and \"redox status\" refers to the balance or homeostasis between these oxidized and reduced compounds. Our body's complex antioxidant networks work to balance the tables of production vs. scavenging of free radicals (aka redox balance). Redox balance is important for cells because it allows for biological molecules, cells, tissues, organs, and physiological systems to go about their normal functions optimally. Free radicals are normal byproducts of our body's everyday cellular processes and essential to immune response\u2014but the goal is to support a homeostasis or balance of these byproducts daily and throughout life. Toxin or oxidant exposure is a part of daily life\u2014whether environmental, lifestyle, or biologic exposures. Nutrients with antitoxin and antioxidant actions in the body support various detox enzymes and pathways. Antitoxin actions describe a nutrient or bioactive that helps neutralize and bind with toxins and cellular debris to ultimately support their clearance (aka excretion) from the body. Antitoxin compounds can support these processes either through direct support (conjugating with toxic substances) or indirectly (by supporting maintenance or replenishment of the body's important antitoxins) to bolster the body's defenses. mindbodygreen's daily detox+ delivers ingredients that support antioxidant and antitoxin pathways and promote redox balance in the body.* Can I take daily detox+ with other mindbodygreen supplements? Absolutely. The entire mindbodygreen supplements+ portfolio is designed so adults can safely and effectively take one or more supplements each day. This detox-focused product can be combined with any mbg supplement. You'll find many complementary combinations to support your health to be the best version of you.* Does mindbodygreen offer a refillable program? Our high-quality formulas are delivered in premium, sustainable, and recyclable packaging (recyclable amber glass bottles and jars, recyclable bags, and recyclable cardboard shipping boxes made from 100% recycled paper). Always looking towards the latest innovations, we carefully and intentionally source our eco-friendly packaging to prioritize the environment, but also to protect the premium ingredients in our capsules, gelcaps, and powders (i.e., vitamins, minerals, botanicals, peptides, probiotics, bioactives) from UV light degradation. This is pivotal to ensure quality standards throughout the lifecycle of the product. Unfortunately many refillable bags or containers do not provide the same protection and stability for our ingredients as our amber glass (bottles, jars) and PET bags achieve. What's more, the product-specific manufacturing information (i.e., specific identifiers such as the lot and date) stamped on each product would be lost when the customer discards the refill packaging, as is customary. That lost information would not enable us to comply with a variety of very important FDA regulations specific to dietary supplements (e.g., cGMPs, adverse event reporting, etc.), and regulatory compliance is something that mindbodygreen respects and prioritizes. From an additional safety standpoint, there are also microbial contamination concerns with refillable vessels over time. Thank you for your consideration as to why we have thoughtfully curated our packaging in the way we do. Is daily detox+ vegan? Yes. This vegan product is also GMO-free, gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free, and major food allergen free.

Most detox diets and products miss the point. It's not about aggressively \"detoxing\" for a few days or weeks, only to get back to \"re-toxing\" and perpetuating the cycle. I recommend healthful eating habits and, when appropriate, thoughtfully chosen supplements to support the body's built-in detoxification systems.
