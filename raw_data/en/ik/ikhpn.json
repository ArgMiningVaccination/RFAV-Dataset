A crucial fat burner that improves weight loss and exercise recovery. One of the most powerful vitamins for wound healing. A widely researched and delivered cancer treatment. High Dose Vitamin C benefits are seemingly endless - with virtually no side effects in sight. When you're under extreme stress or feeling worn out from fighting an infection, vitamin C may help. When you've been out in the sun too long, or noticed those shocking signs of aging in the mirror, a robust dose of vitamin C may help restore your skin's glow and elasticity. It's true that you can get some vitamin C from citrus fruits, red and green peppers, broccoli, strawberries and Brussels sprouts, or even more concentrated doses from chewable tablets and extended-release capsules. Sometimes that's just not enough. Why? Our bodies can only absorb about 18-20 % of the vitamin C we consume orally. When it's delivered by IV, however, vitamin C is 100% bioavailable - so the entire dose floods your bloodstream, maintaining your levels for 2- 3 weeks. Why would you need to supplement for this long? If you're struggling with chronic or adrenal fatigue, viral or bacterial infection (like hepatitis C, Lyme Disease, herpes or Epstein Barr virus) swollen or bleeding gums, poor wound healing, joint pain, loose teeth, or skin spots you need robust, sustained absorption. Intravenously delivered, professionally monitored High Dose Vitamin C may bolster your health and stave off signs of aging on many fronts. For a customized, compassionate consultation with Dr. Schertell and Dr. Mauss call their team at Vibrant Health Naturopathic Medical Center [(603) 610-8882](tel:6036108882) or [contact us here](/contact-us.html). As an antioxidant, collagen builder and energy generator, Vitamin C has become the go-to therapy for quite a few common conditions. High Dose Vitamin C may help resolve: Worldwide research has demonstrated the incredible restorative power Vitamin C (also called L-ascorbic acid or ascorbate) has for our skin, tissues, energy, and immunity. Depending on your condition, IV doses can include from 10 to 100 grams of Vitamic C to achieve therapeutic benefits like those delivered to cancer patients. Some basic clinically validated functions Dr. Schertell and Dr. Mauss deliver it for include: Vitamin C is required in the breakdown of fat for energy use. It helps synthesize carnitine, which serves as a shuttle bringing fats into our cells' mitochondria for energy production. This means it can have a powerful influence on our energy levels. Studies have demonstrated that IV delivered high dose (10 grams) Vitamin C reduced fatigue in office workers for 24 hours. This crucial vitamin may also help you manage stress. Your adrenal glands contain the highest concentration of Vitamin C in your body, and help manufacture your stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. Deficiencies of these hormones can trap you in vicious stress cycle. Vitamin C may be able to directly attack infectious agents like bacteria, viruses, and foreign cells by increasing the body's ability to produce anti-influenza cytokines (powerful immune system cells). It may help prevent heart disease, macular degeneration, and even cancer by boosting immune function efficiently and conveniently. For years, High Dose Vitamin C has been used in cancer care. A vast pool of clinical evidence shows that IV Vitamin C works just like chemotherapy and radiation therapy by releasing free radicals - but without the side effects. And, there are no contraindications for their simultaneous use - in fact, Vitamin C may work synergistically with chemotherapy. As a potent antioxidant, vitamin C helps protect cell structures like collagen, proteins, and DNA from free radicals and reactive oxygen species, which are common in high stress states, chronic illness and infections. Research has shown that vitamin C may reduce the severity of symptoms associated with H1N1 influenza virus and is considered an important add-on therapy in surviving the flu. The benefits of vitamin C for skin have been well documented. Collagen is the structural protein that binds our muscles to our bones, and provides structural support for our veins and arteries. Along with crucial amino acids, Vitamin C is required for collagen synthesis. When you don't have enough collagen, you may have: This thinning can cause ruptured ligaments and tendons, can lead to aneurysms (blood vessel wall thinning), and even stroke. This collagen generation action is what makes Vitamin C an excellent wound healer. Its benefits for sun and age damaged skin are also well documented and becoming very popular in the anti-aging aesthetic medicine field. People who don't have adequate vitamin C intake aren't able to burn fat very effectively. This crucial vitamin may help you metabolize fat, as well as keep your blood sugar levels steady to prevent rollercoaster crashes and cravings. And because it provides an energy boost, you're less likely to be too sluggish for exercise and more likely to burn calories, while replacing fat with muscle. As licensed, IV-trained NDs, Dr. Schertell and Dr. Mauss are able to prescribe, deliver and monitor both medications and supplements in our clean and cozy medical suite. After assessing your symptoms and determining the appropriate dose of preservative-free Vitamin C you require, they will use flexible angiocatheters in an optimal location on your arm to make your experience as painless and relaxed as possible. You'll even be able to move your arm if necessary. This will not feel like a hospital IV. There are, however, always some minor risks of bruising or of an irritated vein when injecting into the bloodstream. Depending on your condition, treatment and protocol, your IV therapy sessions can last anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours. Always eat and drink within 3 hours of your appointment to help stabilize your body. When delivered in the proper doses and under optimal conditions, IV therapy is extremely safe and effective. The power of High Dose Vitamin C may support your adrenal glands, maintain your energy levels, improve and protect your skin, strengthen your tendons and bones, boost your immune system and may even resolve chemotherapy side effects.
