Whether you're new to the activity or have been practicing it for years, yoga can be a wonderful way to stay active and commune with your body and mind at any age. Physical activity\u2014like yoga\u2014does a body good. Along with eating a balanced diet rich in nutrients and low in sugar and salt, physical activity is one of the pillars of healthy living and has more healing power than you may think. According to [Dr. Thomas Best](https://doctors.umiamihealth.org/provider/Thomas+Michael+Best/525986), a sports medicine specialist at the University of Miami Sports Medicine Institute, regular physical activity can be just as effective as a medicinal drug for treating and preventing many different medical conditions and chronic illnesses, including decreasing pain, improving cognition, and reducing depression and anxiety symptoms. Dr. Best encourages condition-specific exercise routines for maximum health outcomes in both adults and children. A patient struggling with depression may benefit from yoga and pilates, he explained, while someone with COPD may benefit more from high intensity interval training.

As we get older, engaging in fitness or recreational activities that improve balance, flexibility, strength, and endurance can enhance quality of life and longevity. Seniors who stay fit find completing daily tasks easier and safer, which provides more energy and independence. Dr. Best emphasized the importance of both endurance and strength training, which are crucial aspects of overall health and longevity. Yoga\u2014along with tai chi and physical therapy movements\u2014are ideal balance exercises, which help prevent falls.

To get started, [walking](https://news.umiamihealth.org/en/walking-good-health/) is an easy and functional way to start a fitness program.

If walking isn't challenging enough, find ways to build endurance, which will allow incorporation of more demanding activities like yoga, dancing, and kickboxing. Working out when sick can worsen symptoms and slow recovery. Certain symptoms can be a warning sign to take a break or cut back on exercising until the body feels better. Dr. Best advised to [skip the workout](https://news.umiamihealth.org/en/is-it-a-bad-idea-to-exercise-when-im-sick/) when symptoms are below the neck.
