It has proven ineffective and has divided the practice of medicine into specialties, forgetting that the body functions in a constant state of homeostasis- all systems reliant on each other to function optimally. I believe that treating the underlying issue, down to the molecular basis, is what needs to be addressed in order to treat and eventually heal the disease. Unfortunately diseases have been categorized into separate entities when there is a common thread that is shared between them. My goal is to heal the mind & body as whole through integrative medicine.

[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ocd)) is often treated on a weekly or twice-weekly schedule, depending on symptom severity and the client's preferences. Some clients may start to see a noticeable improvement in symptoms in as little as six weeks, but it's also possible, especially in more severe cases, for treatment to take several months to a year before significant progress is made. What happens if OCD is not treated? Some people with OCD, especially those with mild symptoms, may find that they are able to adapt reasonably well to life with the condition, even if their symptoms never resolve completely. However, many people, particularly those whose symptoms are severe at the outset, find that their obsessions and compulsions grow more intrusive with time, making it harder to maintain relationships, hold down a job, or navigate the world successfully. Are there medications for OCD? Medication can be used to treat OCD. The class of drugs most often prescribed are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which include fluvoxamine name Luvox), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft), among others. In cases of treatment-resistant OCD, other classes of medication, such as tricyclic antidepressants or atypical antipsychotics, may be prescribed. Medication is frequently used in conjunction with therapy. Can OCD come back after treatment? Yes. Major life transitions, periods of stress, or other factors can cause symptoms to return or, if they were never fully eradicated, to ramp back up in intensity. For some, these relapses are brief and do not require additional treatment; identifying specific triggers and practicing the skills learned in therapy can help speed their course. For others, returning to therapy for a brief period can help address the underlying stress and strengthen coping mechanisms. About Psychiatrists, meds and Psychiatric Nurses.
