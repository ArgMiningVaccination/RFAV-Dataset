Our highly trained physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists administer and supervise these tests, analyzing the results to distinguish between nerve problems and muscle problems. Your test results will help your care team develop a personalized treatment plan and get you back to the activities you enjoy. What is Electrodiagnostic Medicine (EMG/NCV)? Electrodiagnostic medicine is the study of nerve and muscle diseases. Your doctor may order EMG and NCV tests to identify the source of pain, numbness, tingling or weakness in your arms, hands, legs and feet. - [Electromyography (EMG) measures the muscles' electrical activity using tiny needles inserted in specific muscles to evaluate the nerve-muscle communication.] - [Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) measures how fast electrical impulses travel through the nerves. Your doctor or technologist will apply small electrical shocks to your nerves and evaluate the response.] Conditions Diagnosed by EMG/NCV Our specialists use electrodiagnostic medicine to diagnose any problem related to nerves in the spine, arms or legs.
