CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2015 III EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016 III Developed by the AAEP Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee Case history Thoroughbred industry publications reported that the U.S. Attorney's Office in a state district announced filing of criminal charges against \"Dr. A\" for allegedly administer-ing drugs to Thoroughbred racehorses within 24 hours prior to races. This conduct was in violation of the state's criminal law prohibiting the rigging of publicly exhibited contests. The administration of the drugs was not pursuant to a valid prescription and constituted misbranding of the prescription animal drugs in violation of federal law. The alleged activity occurred at various times over a number of years. According to the charges, Dr. A conspired with horse trainers, whose identities are known to the state, to administer drugs in violation of the laws, rules and regula-tions governing the conduct of Thoroughbred racing. The government filed a plea agreement with Dr. A in which he agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's Office in its continuing investigation. After seeing an account of Dr. A's criminal charges and guilty plea, an AAEP member reported this news to the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee. As stated in the AAEP's Ethical and Professional Guidelines, \"All members of the AAEP are expected to comply with ... (d) all rules and regulations of racing applicable at race tracks where practicing; (e) rules of organizations governing horse shows, sales, equine events and the rules of all breed registries in relation to veterinary practices; ... Members and Veterinarians should be honest and fair in their relations with others, and they should not engage in fraud, misrepresentation or deceit. Violation of any of the foregoing may constitute cause for revocation or denial of membership in the AAEP.\" The committee chair wrote Dr. A to inform him that if he wanted to continue his membership in AAEP, he must attend a hearing with the committee to explain the events that led to his guilty plea. Rationale for actions Dr. A responded in a letter admitting that he had adminis-tered, or provided to trainers to administer, substances prohibited by his state's racing commission. However, he also stated that none of the substances were prohibited by the Association of Racing Commissioners International, the umbrella organization of the state racing commis-sions. He further stated that the administered substances were not intended or designed to enhance a horse's racing performance or deceive the betting public. He defended his actions by stating that, in his opinion, virtually everyone in the industry was doing the same thing and he also was protecting his patients from potentially catastrophic injuries. In later communications, Dr. A stated that he would like to appear at a hearing to explain the situation regarding his charges. Hearing results At his hearing before the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee, Dr. A said he was very embarrassed to be involved in a criminal case in which he could be seen as admitting to \"drugging horses\" to their possible detriment and to attempting to affect the outcome of races. He was genuinely sorry about his situation and explained the detrimental effects on his ability to work as a veteri-narian. He was accompanied by two veterinarians who knew him well, and each vouched for Dr. A's character and compassion for horses. In the end, however, the committee members felt obliged to recommend to the AAEP's board of directors that Dr. A not be allowed to renew his membership in AAEP. At its next meeting, the AAEP board voted to support the com-mittee's recommendation that Dr. A could no longer be a member of the AAEP. Conclusion While serving as the healthcare authority for clients' horses, veterinarians must always comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction(s) in which they practice. Venturing beyond the legally defined framework, regardless of whether others are perceived to be operating outside such boundaries, imposes significant professional risk and potentially serious consequences, as Dr. A discovered.Ethics Case Study: 'Because others are doing it' is no excuse to break rules IV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016 Practitioners from Minnesota and Texas to join AAEP board Following a month-long vote by the membership that concluded Sept. 21, Drs.

Not only do these young owners provide the most long-term opportunity for business, but their above-average involve-ment in the horse industry adds to their prospective customer value. Compared with older horse owners, those aged 18-40 are more involved in the horse industry and their horses see an equine veterinarian more frequently. These owners also put as much as or more emphasis on relationship-oriented attributes as they do on their veterinarian's knowledge and experience. Demonstrating compassion, taking time with the horse, explaining diagnoses and having a pleasant demeanor are characteristics that the younger owner places a higher importance on than older owners. With lower incomes than older owners, the 18-40 segment is the most cost-sensitive but also the most likely to increase their already frequent usage of veterinarians. Young owners are the most likely to expect to increase their usage of veterinarian services over the next few years (8% vs. 5% for those aged 41+), pointing to stricter regulations at horse shows and plans to do more preventive care and breeding in the future.

Log in to the Touch website using the same username and password that you use to access the AAEP's primary website, www.aaep.org. The bottom line: young horse owners can contribute to your practice's bottom line if you take the time to understand the attributes they most value in veterinary relationships and services.

AAEP Avenues Practices Equine Clinic at OakenCroft and Rhinebeck Equine hosted the event with collabora-tion from Millbrook Equine. The students toured the clinics, participated in nine different wet labs and learned about externships and internships. The program concluded with a trip to the HITS Championship for the Saugerties $1 Million Grand Prix. \"We were trying to emulate the Opportunities in Equine Practice seminar that was offered in Kentucky when we were going through school,\" said Dr. Miranda Gosselin of Millbrook Equine. \"Although I'm not looking for intern applicants like the other practices, each of us thought it was important to invest in the future veterinar-ians that are coming out and give them an honest answer as to what equine practice is like. It was imperative for us to be transparent and talk about the good and the bad, and I think we managed to do that.\" Event sponsors included AAEP Educational Partners Cargill, Luitpold Animal Health, Merck Animal Health, Merial and Zoetis.\"We had a lot of fun doing it, and it helps that we're three practices that all get along,\" said Dr. Gosselin. \"That made it easy to try to do something together. Practices shouldn't be viewed as being one against the other. I think the future of equine practice and the future of veterinary practice is really more collaborative than it has been.\"New York practices unite for student education and networking event Students rotated through dentistry and eight other wet labs over the course of two days.

Peterson and Smith is offering a three-year ACVS residency in equine surgery (July 2017 - July 2020) to qualified veterinarians interested in gaining experience and confidence while developing and improving their knowledge and practical skills. The program provides residents with extensive exposure to all aspects of both equine surgery and medicine. One emphasis of the Peterson and Smith residency is to provide broad clinical experiences supported by ACVS- and ACVIM-boarded doctors. Arrangements with the University of Florida Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Gainesville enable residents to fulfill the required ACVS special rotations in radiology, pathology, anesthesiology and medicine. Residents travel to Gainesville one day a week until the rotations are completed, usually by the beginning of the second year. This time spent at the university provides quality time with peers and Diplomates of all specialty colleges and access to University of Florida libraries.By the time residents have progressed to their second year, they have begun to accept and manage surgical and medical cases with direct support from all hospital doctors and technical staff. The first year of the program prepares the second- and third-year residents for this responsibility through many hours of training by both observation and practical experience gained from an excellent elective and emergency caseload. Good judgment and surgical and medical expertise are developed through hard work and mentorship, preparing residents for a career in academia or a specialty practice. The primary aim of the Peterson and Smith surgical residency is to produce a highly competent veterinarian with refined surgical skills who is also capable of practicing quality medicine. Qualified veterinarians interested in the residency should send a resume to Peterson & Smith Equine Hospital, Attention: Grace Tirado Perez, Operations Assistant, 4747 offering surgery residencyXII EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016 AAEP Meetings and Continuing Education For more information, contact the AAEP office at (859) 233-0147 or (800) 443-0177 or online at www.aaep.org.

Sub-bandage pressure was measured by a compression measurement system with a sensor consisting of an electronic manometer connected to a plastic bladder. Sensors were placed on the dorsal and lateral cannons of the forelimb. There was a signi cant increase in pressure when an elastic wrap layer was applied over the cotton wool and gauze layers. There was also a signi cant difference in pressures at the two sensor locations, with the dorsal sensor recording higherpressures than the lateral cannon sensor, con rming that sub- bandage pressure is not uniform and care should be taken to avoid excess pressure on the dorsal surface of the distal limb. Most recordings from the dorsal sensor exceeded 189 mmHg (the maximum reading detected by the manometer) after the elastic wrap was applied. Pressures were maintained for the rst 6 h, after which a signi cant decrease in the total sub- bandage pressure was detected, which then stabilised for the remainder of a 24 h monitoring period. When a polo wrap bandage was used, the location of the sensor produced a signi cant difference in pressure as previously, but no signi cant decrease in pressure over time was detected. In this 96 h study using a distal limb compression bandage, there was a signi cant decrease in pressure in the rst 12 h after application. After this, pressures stabilised until around 72 h. Bandage pressures reduced from 170 mmHg at the start of the study to 135 mmHg at 96 h. The fact that pressures were maintained at this level suggests that a 4-day interval between bandage changes may be appropriate for reduction of distal limb oedema. Treatment of sarcoids in equids This retrospective case series by Maarten Haspeslagh and colleagues in Belgium evaluated outcomes following treatment of sarcoids in equids and identi ed risk factors for treatment failure in these patients. Medical records were searched to identify 230 equids with 614 sarcoids. Treatment choice (electrosurgery, electrosurgery with intralesional placement of cisplatin-containing beads, topical administration of imiquimod or acyclovir, cryosurgery, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine injection, or intralesional injection of platinum-containing drugs) was determined using a standardised protocol. Data collected included animal, tumour, treatment and outcome variables. Complete tumour regression without recurrence for 6 months was considered a successful outcome. Success rates were calculated, risk factors for treatment failure were identi ed and effects of the two topical treatments were compared. Effects of the number of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine or cisplatin-containing drug injections on outcome were compared using a v2test. The overall success rate was 460/614 (74.9%). The highest treatment success rate (277/319 [86.8%]) resulted from electrosurgical excision; odds of treatment failure were signi cantly greater for intralesional injection of platinum- containing drugs, cryosurgery and topical acyclovir treatment. Odds of treatment failure were signi cantlygreater for sarcoids on equids with multiple tumours than for solitary lesions, and signi cantly lower for sarcoids on equids that received concurrent immunostimulating treatment for another sarcoid than for those on patients that did not receive such treatment. Selection bias for treatments was inherent to the study design; however, results may help clinicians select treatments and determine prognosis for equids with sarcoids treated according to the described methods. Palmar/plantar annular ligament mineralisation This retrospective study by Elaine Garvican and colleagues inthe UK documents the clinical presentation, diagnosis and surgical treatment of mineralisation of the equine palmar/plantar annular ligament (PAL). Seven surgically-treated lameness associated with PAL mineralisation were identi ed from case records from two referral hospitals. Follow-up information was obtained from the owners by telephone questionnaire. Duration of lameness before referral ranged from 5 weeks to 6 months, and degree of lameness from grade 1 to 5 out of 10. Three cases had obvious pain when pressure was applied over the PAL. Pain resulting in lameness was localised to this area and all cases were treated surgically, although the extent of resected tissue varied among cases. Histological examination of resected tissue (4 cases) revealed brocartilaginous and/or osseous metaplasia. Following surgery, six of the seven ponies became sound. Based on this limited case series, surgical treatment for mineralisation of the PAL offers a favourable success rate without severe complications where conservative methods have failed. Impingement of the dorsal spinous processes Impingement of the dorasl spinous processes (DSPs) is a common cause of pain and poor performance in sport horses. In this study Hilary Clayton and Narelle Stubbs, based in the USA and Slovakia, investigated regional differences in the prevalence and severity of DSP osseous lesions in the equine thoracolumbar spine. The authors hypothesised that lesion severity would increase with horse age and height, and that severe lesions would be more prevalent in the mid-caudal thoracic region. The thoracolumbar spines of 33 horses were removed post- mortem, disarticulated and boiled out. The thoracic and lumbar DSPs were examined for the presence of proliferative or lytic osseous lesions of the DSPs. Age and height of the horses were recorded, and severity of pathological changes at each vertebral level was scored using an ordinal grading system (grades 0 -3) and a continuous visual analog scale (VAS). Osseous lesions of the DSPs were present at every vertebral level from C7 -T1 to L6 -S1, and 70% of horses had at least one lesion of severity grade 2 or higher. Grade 3 lesions were found in the Analysis of VAS data using analysis of variance indicated that increasing age and height were associated with more severe osseous lesions. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd598 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016Osseous lesions of the DSPs occur frequently in horses with more severe lesions in the cranial thoracic, mid to caudal thoracic, and mid-lumbar regions. Lesions in the cranial thoracic and lumbar regions present a challenge for diagnostic imaging and may be underdiagnosed clinically. Outcomes for super cial digital flexor tendonitis Super cial digital flexor (SDF) tendonitis is a common injury in Thoroughbred racehorses that requires prolonged rehabilitation and has unpredictable outcomes with a high incidence of re-injury. In this study Stefan Witte and colleagues based in Switzerland, Ireland and the UKcompared race outcomes after common treatments for tendon healing in National Hunt (NH) racehorses. Clinical and racing records were evaluated for 127 NH racehorses treated for an SDF tendon injury. Two age- and sex-matched control horses were selected for each case horse to analyse the effect on post-injury racing outcomes of pre-injury data, lesion severity and treatment group (controlled exercise alone, bar ring, intralesional platelet- rich plasma [PRP], tendon splitting, tendon splitting combined with bar ring). Control horses raced more often than case horses, with higher maximum racing post rating(RPRmax) and longer racing distances. Pre-injury racingperformance was not associated with treatment group. Rateof return to racing was not associated with lesion severity ortreatment group. Number of races, total distance racedpost-injury and RPRmax were not associated with lesionseverity or treatment group. Controlled exercise aloneoffered similar post-injury racing outcomes in NH racehorseswith SDF tendonitis to the other treatment options examined.Bar ring, either alone or in conjunction with tendon splitting, provided no additional bene t in rate of return to racing and race performance. Innate immune system in dental disease This study by Rebekah Kennedy and colleagues in the UK examined gingival Toll-like receptor and cytokine messenger RNA levels in equine periodontitis and oral health. Concentrations of several Toll-like receptors and cytokines of the innate immune system in gingival samples from 13 healthy horses and 20 with signs of periodontal disease were compared. There was a signi cant correlation between the severity of periodontal disease and the expression of TLR2, IL- 1b, IL-6, IL-10, and TLR9 was signi cantly increased in tissue samples from the periodontitis group compared with the healthy gingivae group. In particular, TLR2 mRNA showed a very large increase (389-fold) compared with controls. For some subjects, samples of healthy gingival tissue were compared with diseased lesions within the same horse, with mRNA expression for these TLR again being increased in diseased sections. The expression of mRNA encoding for all cytokines was increased in tissues affected by periodontitis compared with healthy controls, with IL-12 showing the greatest increase. Within the same horse, diseased tissue sections again showed signi cantly increased cytokine expression compared with tissue from healthy sites. Thesedata suggest that in periodontitis, recognition of pathogenicbacteria by Toll-like receptors results in receptor upregulationand in turn, increased expression of pro-in flammatory andanti-in flammatory cytokines. Further research into the interaction of periodontal bacteria and the innate immune response is warranted. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing This study by Claire Robinson and colleagues in the UK aimedto identify the most frequently cultured bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility pro les from septic synovial samples, to allow recommendations regarding appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy prior to culture results. Hospital records for all horses with synovial sepsis and a synovial sample submitted to the microbiology laboratory ofa referral hospital over a period of 10 years were retrieved (379 samples). One horse had positive cultures from more than one synovial structure, and two horses had positive cultures obtained from repeat samples. A total of 114 bacterial isolates were obtained. Gram-positive bacteria were isolated in 75% of cases, of which 22% were haemolytic Staphylococcus spp., and 52% were Staphylococcus aureus including two multidrug-resistant isolates. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 25% of cases. Anaerobic Clostridium spp. was isolated in 3% of cases. Of the rst line antimicrobials, oxytetracycline and doxycycline were effective against 70 -100% of the Gram-positive bacteria and 20-100% of the Gram-negative whilst the ef cacy of trimethoprim -sulphamethoxazole and gentamicin ranged between 50 and 88% for both Gram-positive and Gram- negative bacteria. Of the equine protected antimicrobials, ceftiofur was effective against 70 -90% of all bacterial isolates whilst 80% of isolates were susceptible to enro floxacin. or antimicrobials for treatment of synovial sepsis cases while awaiting laboratory results. These ndings support current recommendations for antimicrobial stewardship in equine medicine. S. WRIGHT EVE Editorial Of ce References Canada, N.C., Beard, W.L., Guyan, M.E. and White, B.J.

Pearce The Six young horses presented with clinical signs of maxillary cheek teeth apical infection (bilateral in 2 horses) thatincluded the presence of rostral maxillary swellings withdischarging sinus tracts and were unexpectedly found to haveno evidence of endodontic infection in 7 affected teeth. Theapical infection of these teeth was attributed to infundibulardysplasia that allowed inoculation of the periapical tissue withcontaminated oral contents. Treatment was by debridementand obturation of affected infundibula from their occlusalaspect using techniques normally used for endodontictherapy. Five out of 6 cases showed resolution of clinical signsover a mean follow-up period of 19 months (range 6-48months). These cases demonstrate that patency of theinfundibular apex is a potential cause of cheek teeth apicalinfection in young horses, which can be successfully treatedby debridement and subsequent infundibular restoration. Introduction funnel-shapedenamel invaginations from the occlusal surface present inincisor teeth (n = 1) and maxillary cheek teeth (n = 2). Cheekteeth infundibular length is significantly associated with age,with infundibula being up to 99% of the length of the cheekteeth in young horses to as little as 4% in older horses and theycan range between 2 and 89 mm in length (Fitzgibbon et al . 2010). During deciduous premolar development, cementoblasts originating from the occlusal aspect of the dental sac come torest beneath the infundibular ameloblast layer at 210 daysgestation Dacre 2006). is initiallydeposited around the the infundibulum,followed progressively by more apical cementum deposition.At the time of eruption, infundibular cement is progressively lessdense towards the infundibular apex, where vascularconnective tissue is present with cemental deposition aroundthe periphery of the infundibulum (Baker 1979). In addition tothis incomplete apical cement deposition present at dentaleruption, there are many reports of infundibular cementalhypoplasia in erupted cheek teeth, affecting all aspects ofinfundibula but most commonly present towards theinfundibular apex, with prevalence of such lesions rangingfrom 0.4 to 100% depending on age and method ofexamination 1974; Wafa More recently, infundibular hypocementosis has been used for this disorder (Suske et al . 2014). In recently erupted cheek teeth, connective tissue and blood vessels thought to derive from thedental sac have been identified within central cementaldefects mainly at the apical aspect of the infundibula (Kilicet al . 1997). Others have attributed the presence of this apical vascular connective tissue to a continuing If the central infundibular cemental defects are large enough, areas ofcemental hypoplasia with necrotic connective tissue thatcontain food particles may be found (Kilic et al . 1997). Such an infundibular infection could progress to the periapical tissues inthe event of incomplete enamel formation of the infundibularapex or if the existing apical enamel was destroyed by thisinfection. Maxillary cheek teeth apical infection has previously been described to occur due to anachoresis (blood borneinfection), dental fracture, extension of infection from theperiodontium or from enamel breach A study of 57 maxillary dental apical infections foundjust one case to be secondary patencyand . 2008b). On sectioning the extracted tooth, all 5 pulp canals were vital at the apexdespite apical infection. A further case report describedtreatment of apical infection secondary to apical infundibularpatency of a 07 tooth; however , no clinical follow-upwas recorded (Menzies et al . 2012). This case series describes the presenting signs, investigation, treatment and follow-up findings of 6 horses (7affected teeth) diagnosed with maxillary cheek teeth apicalinfection secondary to oro-apical contamination caused bypatent infundibula. Case 1 History A 3-year-old Welsh Section A gelding was presented with a6-month history of left-sided maxillary facial swelling with asinus tract, lying immediately dorsorostral to the rostralextremity of the left facial crest. Trimethoprim/sulfadiazinetherapy had resulted in a temporary response on 4 occasionsand the pony was then referred for possible endodontictherapy of a suspected cheek tooth apical infection. Diagnostic findings A firm facial swelling with a small sinus tract was present ( Fig 1 ) that was larger than the facial swelling caused by an 'eruption AE / NOVEMBER that was present contralaterally. Oral examination including orososcopy (Storz 45 cm Borescope1, Fiegert Endocam2) revealed the occlusal aspect of some infundibula to be wide and open, with food present in the infundibula ofboth 108 and 208, which was considered within the normalrange for recently erupted maxillary teeth ( Fig 2 ). No occlusal secondary dentine defects were identified on any teeth.Radiography revealed apical lucency (even more thanexpected in a recently erupted tooth), mild periapical sclerosisand widening of the periodontal ligament around the 208apex. A metal probe inserted into the facial sinus tract wasidentified at the 208 apex ( Fig 3 ). Treatment Endodontic therapy of the apically infected 208 from the occlusal aspect (orthograde) was attempted to avoidextraction in such a young horse. Initially, odontoplasty (5 mm depth) of the occlusal surface was performed using adiamond disc instrument (HDE Evolution and Flexxidisc) 3and the pulp canals were then accessed by drilling through theremaining subocclusal secondary dentine using a No. 8 round,tungsten steel bur on a high speed sterile saline-cooledpneumatic handpiece. Contrary to expectations, pulp canalsNos. 1-4 (Du Toit et al . 2008b, pulp numbering system) had pulp normal in gross appearance and which also showed a normaldegree of haemorrhage (V ertucci and Haddix 2011) ( Fig 4 ). A decision was made not to proceed with exposing pulpnumber 5 (closely connected to pulp 3 in teeth of this ageKopke et al . 2012) and vital pulp capping was then performed on the 4 surgically exposed pulps (Rawlinson and Earley 2013).The infundibula were then probed using a 31 mm steelendodontic file (K-flex) 4, which was passed with minimal resistance to its full length. The infundibula were then cleanedand debrided using 60 mm 5using an endodontic lubricant gel (Canal Plus)6 and during this procedure some grey-brown, malodorousdebris was retrieved from the infundibula. These 60 mm longfiles could be passed to their full length with minimal resistance.A 20 gauge 90 mm spinal needle (with stylet removed) wasthen bent to 90\u00b0 adjacent to its port and passed into the rostralinfundibulum to a depth of 85 mm. The needle was connectedto a peristaltic pump (120S, Watson & Marlow) 7and the infundibulum flushed with sterile saline. Almost immediately ajet of fluid emerged from the sinus tract, confirming thepresence of communication between the infundibulum andsinus tract ( Fig 5 ). The repeated and in tota l1lo f saline was flushed through the rostral infundibulum whilst massaging the sinus tract externally to assistin removal of necrotic debris. No communication to the tooth Fig 1: Facial swelling and discharging tract from apex of 208 inCase 1 . Fig 2: Oroscopic image of occlusal aspect of 208 showing juvenile(open) infundibula with food impaction in Case 1 . Fig 3: Left L30DLVO radiograph with metal probe inserted into external tract and extending to dental periapical region of 208 inCase 1 . \u00a92015 VETERINARY EDUCATION found from the caudal infundibulum. The rostral infundibular canal was then dried using suction (using theperistaltic pump in reverse) and with 90 mm paper points (DrShipps) 8. A new spinal needle was then placed into the infundibulum as described above and calcium hydroxide(CaOH) paste (Calasept) 9injected through it whilst slowly withdrawing the needle, thus allowing a column of CaOHpaste to fill the infundibulum. Occlusally, a layer ofsilicon-based zinc oxide temporary luting cement (Temposil) 10 was applied as an intermediate layer , which was burred backto a depth of approximately 10 mm once it had set and a finalocclusal layer of dental composite (Rebuilda) 11applied after bonding using the single etch technique (Adper PromptL-Pop) 12. Outcome Re-examination 6 weeks later showed the sinus tract to havecompletely healed (for the first time in 6 months) and the facialswelling to be reduced. The above treatment was repeated,retrieving mildly discoloured calcium hydroxide paste withminimal malodour from the rostral infundibulum. A third andfinal treatment was performed after a further month when only a small amount of calcium hydroxide was placed apically andthe intermediate layer was placed using a 19 gauge needleextension tip inserted into the mixing tip to advance thematerial as far apically as possible. The occlusal compositelayer was applied to a depth of approximately 15 mm. Norecurrence of clinical signs was noted to date, 18 months afterinitial treatment. Case 2 History A 2-year-old riding pony mare was referred with a 5-weekhistory of unilateral, malodorous left-sided swellings, rostrodorsal rostral aspect of the facial crest that had temporarilyresponded to a course of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine. Large,2 cm deep cavities were noted in the centre of partiallyfractured Triadan 506 and 606 (deciduous) teeth. Diagnostic findings At referral, the above-noted facial swellings were thought tobe excessively large for eruption cysts, even in a small pony.Fragmented remnants of the 506 and 606 were present withnecrotic food material impacted between them and thepermanent teeth. Radiography showed apical lucency (morethan expected in an erupting tooth) and periapical sclerosismainly affecting the caudal aspects of the 106 and 206 apices(Fig 6 ). No subocclusal secondary dentinal pulp defects, were noted; however , food wasimpacted occlusally in the immature, wide infundibula.Following cleaning, a large central cemental defect wasidentified which readily allowed passage of 60 mmendodontic files to their full length ( Figs 7 and 8, imaged at second treatment).

After one month, thefacial swellings had reduced and the nasal discharge hadresolved. Treatment was repeated at this time, following whichcomputed tomography imaging was obtained to assess theefficacy of infundibular treatment and also to examine thepulp canals for evidence of disease. Three-dimensionalmultiplanar reconstruction (MPR) of these images wasperformed using Osirix 13software. Frontal plane images showed no evidence of pulpitis; however , there was stillmarked periapical reaction around 206. Examination ofenlarged images identified minute defects in the apical infundibular enamel. The infundibula were found to bevariably filled with endodontic material, with the compositerestorative material in the occlusal aspect of infundibula mostclearly providing an oral seal ( Figs 9 ,10,11). Two further similar infundibular restorative treatments were performed over the following 6 months. At the final treatment,no calcium hydroxide was placed and dental composite wasplaced using a No. 19 needle inserted into the mixing tip toallow its deep placement in the infundibulum. No recurrenceof clinical signs has occurred to date, 3.5 years since initial Fig 7: Oroscopic view of 106 at follow-up showing narrow occlusalinfundibular openings in Case 2 .

The occlusal composite restorations appear to be wearing normally and continue to be well bonded ( Fig 12 ). Case 3 Case details, treatment and outcome A 2.5-year-old Dartmoor pony mare was referred for bilateral facial swelling and a history of left-sided intermittentmalodorous nasal discharge of 3 months' duration thattemporarily responded to antibiotics. The diagnostic andradiographic protocols were as for Case 2 . Teeth 106 and 206 had central infundibular cemental defects present that werealmost identical to those of Case 2 and both teeth had infundibular treatment performed as described previously.Three months later , a computed tomography examinationshowed apical infundibular defects of 106 and 206 teeth with presence of endodontic material beyond the apex of theinfundibulum in the surrounding periodontal tissues ( Fig 13 ). Two further previously described infundibular restorationtreatments were performed over a 12-month period. Clinicalsigns resolved one month after the first treatment; however ,a recurrence of left-sided nasal discharge was noted 2 monthslater , immediately prior to the second treatment. Therehas been no recurrence to date, 14 months since initialtreatment. Case 4 History and diagnostic findings A 3-year-old Clydesdale gelding was referred months' durationthat was unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. Radiographyrevealed left-sided fluid opacity within the maxillary sinusesand a small circular lucency with a radiodense outer border atthe apex of 210. Oroscopic examination revealed anabnormally-shaped clinical crown of 210 with asupernumerary (third) infundibulum on its palatal aspect filledwith food material ( Fig 14 ). A computed tomography showed seenat the palatal aspect of the 210 apex that had a thinhyperattenuating border similar in size and shape to the lesionidentified radiographically ( Fig 15 ). A narrow hypoattenuating tract extended occlusally from this structure within the palatalaspect of the clinical crown, approximating the position of thethird infundibulum seen oroscopically. There was also a defectof the palatal border of the mid third of the reserve crown. Noevidence of pulp disease was noted and a diagnosis of sinusitissecondary to oro-sinus communication via a patentsupernumerary infundibulum was made. Treatment and outcome Under standing sedation, the concho-frontal and caudalmaxillary sinuses were flushed with 10 l of warm saline via a Fig 11: Transverse plane computed 206 Case 2 . Fig 13: plane computed image to the infundibula and fillingmuch of the infundibular canals of 106 and 206 in Case 3 . \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd604EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / diameter concho-frontal trephine opening. The affected infundibulum was debrided from within the oralcavity and restored as previously described. When flushing thepatent infundibulum through a 90 mm spinal needle, a scanttrickle of clear fluid exited the left nostril. The clinical signsresolved for 3 months; however , the nasal discharge thenreturned and the referring practitioner requested extraction ofthe affected tooth. This was performed by oral extraction withthe long (10 cm) crown sectioned orally to allow completeextraction. The cut surfaces of the tooth showed thesupernumerary palatal infundibulum to be well obturated withcalcium Fig 16 ); however , periodontitis was identified at the dysplastic palatal border ofthe reserve crown that may have been the cause of theongoing apical infection.Case 5 Case details A 9-year-old Warmblood X Thoroughbred mare was referredfor extraction of a midline, sagitally fractured 209 tooth withloss of the buccal fragment identified at a routine dentalexamination. The fracture had passed through 2 grosslycarious infundibula. The remaining palatal fragment wasextracted orally under maxillary caudal 209 had likely fractured secondaryto advanced infundibular caries, a decision was made torestore the 109 infundibula. Radiography showed evidence ofapical infection mainly affecting the rostral apex of 109. Treatment Both infundibula of 109 were cleared of all impacted foodmaterial and loose, carious dental tissue using a dental pick,followed by a 24 mm No. 8 round bur , then a 31 mm taperedfissure bur on a pneumatic water-cooled high speedhandpiece using oroscopic apically within the infundibula wasremoved using endodontic files and gel as previouslydescribed. The infundibula were flushed with 150 ml of 3%sodium hypochlorite (Milton) 14through a 19 gauge 40 mm needle attached to a Luer Lock extension set and 50 mlsyringe. Oroscopic examination of the cleaned infundibularevealed an enamel defect at the apex of the rostralinfundibulum. A 60 mm Hedstrom file was inserted into thisdefect and radiography confirmed that its tip lay within theperiapical tissues ( Fig 17 ). Saline was flushed into the infundibulum through an angled 90 mm 20 gauge spinalneedle as previously described; however , little saline could beflushed when the needle tip was placed through the enameldefect at the apex of the infundibulum. A small amount ofcalcium hydroxide paste was then deposited into theperiapical region through the enamel defect and a layer ofultraviolet light curing calcium hydroxide base liner(Calcicure) 11placed over this to seal the infundibular defect. Fig 14: Oroscopic view of 210 at presentation. A supernumeraryinfundibulum is present palatal to the normal rostral and caudalinfundibula in Case 4 Fig 15: sinuses in Case 4 . Fig 16: and extraction. EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016Both infundibula were then restored using a layered technique of flowable dual cured microhybrid composite11bonded using the single etch technique12with a 35 mm 19 gauge needle extension tip under oroscopic guidance. The horse remainedasymptomatic 15 months later. Case 6 Case details A 3-year-old Welsh Section B pony gelding was referred forassessment of right-sided maxillary swelling with a sinus tract of2 months' duration that had temporarily responded toantibiotic therapy. The clinical and radiographic examinations(Fig 18 ) and treatment were as described for Case 1 . Only one treatment was performed and no recurrence was reportedover the following 6 months. A summary of all case details is shown in Table 1 . Discussion Apical infection of maxillary cheek teeth is well reported but the exact aetiopathogenesis is often unclear. The endodonticsystem and periapical tissues may become infectedsecondary to periodontal disease, deep infundibular carieswith enamel involvement, traumatic fractures or iatrogenicpulpar exposure. In the absence of detecting any physical route of oral bacterial contamination of the pulps or deepperiodontal tissues, the remaining cases of apical infection arebelieved be caused by anachoresis, i.e. bacteria originatingfrom the blood or lymphatic system (Dacre et al . 2008a,b; B\u00fchler et al . 2013). In addition to causing 18% of endodontic and subsequent apical infection of maxillary (Dacre et al advanced infundibular caries may progress to midline sagittalcheek teeth fractures, most commonly in the 12 to 20-year-oldage group, with the 09 teeth being overrepresented in suchcases et al . . 2007; O'Neill et al . 2011). These fractures were initially termed 'idiopathicfractures' (Dixon et al . 2000) but more recently have been termed infundibular caries-related cheek teeth fractures(Dixon et al . 2014). These fractures have been reported to occur at a mean age of 9.5 years in one study (Dacre et al . 2007) and in other studies 12 (Taylor and Dixon 2007) and 11years (Dixon et al . 2007). In contrast, the affected teeth in this study were predominantly in younger horses (mean age 3years 8 months), involved the 09 position in a single case andaffected teeth had no significant infundibular caries,suggesting a different aetiopathogenesis. There was a close relationship between the expected dental eruption age and the age at presentation in 5 out of6 of these cases. For example, Cases 2 (aged 2 years) and 3 (aged 2 years 6 months) presented with bilateral apicalinfections of 106 and 206 and Cases 1 and 6(3 years of age) presented with apical infections of 108, all around their timeof eruption (Ramzan et al . 2009). Case 5 was 8 years old and the apical change was more advanced suggesting longerstanding disease. Case 3 , aged 3 years 6 months, presented with apical infection of tooth 110 secondary to a smalldysplastic hypocementotic infundibulum. It is hypothesisedthat these teeth all had central infundibular hypocementosiswhich at eruption resulted in passage of food and bacteriaapically up the wider central infundibular channel to theinfundibular apex. Premature disruption of the occlusalvascular supply or rapid bacterial invasion of the infundibularapex may have compromised ameloblastic activity resultingin a developmental or acquired patent infundibular apex,allowing abnormal communication from the infundibularapex to the periapical tissues (Menzies et al . 2012). It is possible that this process is due either to premature loss of thedeciduous dentition of premolars or premature eruption ofmolars. It has been shown in a single case that dental apical infection secondary to patent infundibulum may occurwithout any loss of pulp vitality (Dacre et al . 2008a). The close proximity of the infundibular apex to the dental apex in younghorses (Fitzgibbon et al . 2010) means that infection of a patent infundibulum would cause infection of the apical peridontaltissues and result in apical swelling. Fistula formation would alsooccur relatively easily due to the proximity of the dental apexto the overlying maxillary bone (that often has defects overeruption cysts in younger horses), sinus or nasal passages.Escape of purulent material from an infected apex through thisthin or disrupted maxillary bone may help survival of the apicalpulp in these cases by preventing periapical accumulation ofbacteria and necrotic debris. The techniques used to treat apical infection in this series were similar to treatments described for orthogradeendodontic therapy of apically infected upper and lower Fig 17: Right L30DLVO radiography with a 60 mm Hedstrom fileinserted into the rostral infundibulum of 109 and extending into theperiapical region in Case 5 . Fig 18: Right L30DLVO radiograph with metal probe inserted into anexternal tract and extending into the dental periapical region of108 in Case 6 . \u00a92015 / AE 2016equine cheek teeth (Lundstrom 2012). It was hypothesised that placement of calcium hydroxide at the infundibular apexwould be antibacterial and may stimulate odontoblasticactivity apical to the infundibulum, thus sealing it with tertiarydentine. Sodium hypochlorite was not used to sterilise infectedinfundibula in these cases owing to its potential cytotoxiceffects in the event of periapical leakage, except in Case 5 for disinfection of an infundibulum with deep caries but whichhad an intact was considered todamage the apical vascular supply and was similarly notemployed to assist drainage of any of the facial abscesses.Most teeth were treated on at least one occasion with adeeper layer of restorative applied at the final treatment.Occlusal wear will result in eventual loss of the occlusalrestoration in these cases and so these cases have beenadvised to have the restorations carefully examined at futureroutine dental examinations and be retreated if the restorationappears to be failing. In future cases, deeper placement ofrestoration material using long extension tips and possibleself-etching and self-bonding materials will be attempted, thusavoiding the need to place bonding agent deep into anarrow infundibular cavity. Conclusion Maxillary dental apical infection in young horses may occursecondary to apical patency of one or more infundibulacombined with central infundibular hypocementosis. Suchcases usually present with clinical signs at or soon aftereruption of the affected tooth. If diagnosed early, the dentalpulps may remain vital despite the periapical infection andtreatment of affected infundibula by debridement andrestoration may result in resolution of the apical infection.Further studies on the aetiopathogenesis and prevalence ofpatent infundibula are required.

Baratt Salem Valley Equine Clinic, Salem, Connecticut, USA. Corresponding author email: rbaratt1dvm@gmail.com Historically, the era of modern human dentistry dates back to the discovery of x-rays by Konrad Wilhelm von Roentgren in 1895 and the use of local anaesthesia (cocaine) by E.C. Briggs in 1892. Endodontic treatment using gutta percha was introduced about 1925, and by the mid-1930s, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and calcium hydroxide were accepted as the preferred materials for chemical disinfection of the root canals and vital pulp capping. Rapid advances in endodonticsoccurred throughout the second half of the 20th century. Instruments, materials and treatment methods were standardised, while new instruments were made and rened to streamline the safety, ef ciency and effectiveness of endodontic treatment. In the last 15 years, furtheradvancements have included improvements in instrumentationand choices of materials that speed up the shaping, sterilisationand obturation of the root canals, as well as signi cant progress in implantology and regenerative endodontics. Fortunately for the veterinary dentist, all materials and techniques developed for dentistry in man and the evidence- based medicine that supports these techniques are generally applicable in small animal dentistry (barring the ethical constraints of performing procedures for purely cosmetic purposes). However, this is not the case for the horse. The hypsodont tooth anatomy and physiology presents enormous challenges in radiographic imaging, as well as application of the basic principles of successful endodontic treatment. Serial sectioning of extracted equine teeth and histological examination provided early evidence of the complexity of the equine cheek tooth anatomy (Windley et al. 2009b). However, even with the advent of digital radiography techniques, the extensive peripheral enamel infolding and enamel-lined infundibulae obscure the radiographic endodontic anatomy of cheek teeth. More recently, the complex endodontic system of the equine cheek tooth has been imaged with greater clarity with computed tomographic (CT) studies (Figs 1 -3) 2009a; Kopke et al. 2012; Barakzai and Barnett 2015). However, even with CT, the diagnosis of cheek tooth pathology remains challenging (Buhler et al. 2014). The brachydont tooth has a supragingival common pulp chamber within the clinical crown that tapers in a conicalmanner to the apex of each root. This anatomy allows for an orthograde approach with access through the crown. With hand and motorised les, the necrotic pulp and diseased dentin can be removed and the canal shaped to permit efcient irrigation with antiseptic solutions, typically chlorhexidine or sodium hypochlorite. However, in the cheek teeth of the horse, the pulp chamber is located quite apically, with 5 -7 pulp horns extending coronally through the reserve crown to terminate at a variable depth to the occlusal surface (White and Dixon 2010). As illustrated in CT images of the equine cheek teeth, the pulp horns tapercoronally, have a very irregular cross-sectional geometry and variable communications (Kopke et al. 2012; Buhler et al. 2014). Thus the oral, orthograde approach to the endodontic system of the equine cheek teeth allows access to the pulp horns at their narrow coronal terminus and the pulp horn anatomy greatly hinders effective mechanical debridement and irrigation that would be essential to sterilising the endodontic system. One could argue that this rst component of human endodontics, cleaning and shaping of the root canal, is not realistically feasible in the horse from the oral (orthograde) approach. A surgical, retrograde approach to performing endodontic treatment of the horse 's cheek teeth would appear to be preferable. Apicoectomy at the level of the common pulp chamber (transection just coronal to the relatively short hypsodont roots) would give the dentist access to the pulp horns at their widest diameter, permitting shaping and disinfection techniques similar to those used in brachydont teeth. However, surgical access to the maxillary cheek teeth requires sinusotomy for the molars or an approach crowded by neurovascular structures for thepremolars. Haemostasis for a dry visual operative eld is quite problematic. Published reports of this technique are few, with relatively low success rates and no imaging of long-term follow-up (Simhofer et al. 2008). A novel approach to endodontic therapy of equine cheek teeth has recently been described that involves oralextraction of the apically infected cheek tooth, ex vivo retrograde endodontic treatment, followed by replantation of the tooth (Stoll 2014). Again, there is very weak evidence- based medicine (EBM) to support this technique. The second component of brachydont endodontics is obturation of the root canal. This is the process of lling the root canal with a physiologically inert material that prevents bacterial colonisation of the root canal while 'entombing ' bacteria that remain in the canal after the cleaning process. Here again, the equine cheek tooth presents signi cant roadblocks. If organic matter cannot be removed from the complex endodontic system, large numbers of bacteria will likely remain in the apical portion of the tooth that is not accessible for effective disinfection or obturation using retrograde techniques. Evidence-based medicine in human endodontics clearly supports the correlation of a high quality restoration of the endodontically-treated tooth with long-term clinical success (Gillen et al. 2011). Leakage of the restoration, whether a crown or a bonded composite material is used, is associated with failure of the endodontic therapy (Hommez et al. 2002). Since the equine cheek tooth undergoes physiological occlusal attrition over the life of the horse, the materials used for both pulp horn-root canal obturation and occlusal restoration must remain leakproof as this process of attrition \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd609 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016occurs. The scienti c validation of the materials and techniques used in man cannot be assumed to apply to the horse. In vitro assessment of endodontic disinfection, obturation and access restoration techniques have not yet been adequately performed in the equine cheek tooth. This should be a prerequisite to prospective clinical studies. Given the lifespan of the horse, it will likely be another 20 years before there is EBM to support these techniques in the horse. In this issue, Lundstr \u20acom and Wattle (2016) has presented clinical support for orthograde cleaning and disinfection of the endodontic system of the apically infected equine cheek tooth with calcium hydroxide paste. This technique has been used in human endodontics since the early 20th century (Kim and Kim 2014). However, with the exception of vital pulp capping, it is the rst step in staged endodontic therapy. The root canal is lled with calcium hydroxide paste and the access cavity restored with a temporary restorative material. After a period of time, the patient returns to the endodontist who removes the temporary restoration and the remaining calcium hydroxide so that the canal can be obturated and a permanent restoration placed. The highly basic pH of calcium hydroxide makes it a very effective antiseptic. The cytotoxic effects of this material are limited to a narrow zone and the physiological response is periapical healing (Kim and Kim 2014). High quality radiographic imaging of the apical alveolar bone can be used to monitor this healing response,which includes hard tissue closure of the apices of immature permanent teeth (apexi cation). In man and brachydont species (cat and dog), 2.5 -5% sodium hypochlorite solutions (bleach) have been used extensively for cleaning and disinfecting the root canals (Estrela et al. 2002). In these species it is relatively easy to protect the oral tissue from the cytotoxic effects of this irrigant using impermeable barriers (dental dams). However, in the horse it is unlikely that the oral soft tissues can be protectedfrom the inadvertent contact with bleach. The accompanying paper by Lundstr \u20acom and Wattle (2016) provides weak evidence-based support for use of calcium hydroxide paste for canal sterilisation in the horse. However, the reported promising anecdotal clinical response justi es continued study of this method of endodontic cleaning and disinfection of the equine cheek tooth. In vitro assessment of this technique could be performed on extracted cheek teeth that are apically infected. If effective endodontic sterilisation of the equine cheek tooth with calcium hydroxide can be demonstrated in vitro , the next obstacle to overcome is obturation and restoration of the tooth. Limited research has been published on the effectiveness of human products for the restoration of coronal endodontic access cavities or apical teeth (Steenkamp et al. 2005; Dixon et al. 2014). Presently, the material with properties that would seem PL2 5 34 +16 BL 3 + 5B1,2,4+6 1,2,4+6 3+5641 23 B 5La) b) c) d) e) f) g) Fig 1: Axial anatomical section (a), axial (b) and coronal (c and d) CT images and 3D CT reconstructions of the enamel (g) and pulp (f) separately and the enamel and pulp combined (e) of a Triadan 306 tooth with an eruption age of 1.5 years.

There is now a signi cant body of research supporting the use of this material as a root end lling material in the brachydont tooth. Mineral trioxide aggregate, like calcium hydroxide, is quite basic yet has low cytotoxicity. When placed in the apex of an immature permanent tooth it also promotes apexi cation. However, unlike calcium hydroxide, MTA is a cement that chemically bonds to dentin and it is not water-soluble. Mineral trioxide aggregate in its original form has a slow setting time and is dif cult to place in the apical end of the canal in an orthograde manner. However, there is active research into modifying MTA as well as the development of new bioactive ceramics to achieve both a rapid setting time and better handling properties (Utneja et al. 2015). One of these newer materials may be a good candidate for laboratory investigation as a combined obturation-restoration material in equine cheek tooth orthograde endodontic therapy. Also in this issue, Pearce (2016) reports the staged use of calcium hydroxide and infundibular restoration for treatment of apically infected maxillary cheek teeth in which the underlying aetiology is apical patency of the infundibulum. The infundibula of maxillary cheek teeth have also been recently investigated both in vivo and in extracted teeth with high resolution CT (Windley et al. 2009b; Fitzgibbon et al. 2010; al. 2012). Some degree of 'cemental hypoplasia 'appears to be a normal feature of the equine maxillary cheek tooth. On the occlusal surface, this isrecognised clinically as defects ranging from slight widening of the remnant of the centrally located vascular channel, to larger defects that result in feed stasis and caries (bacterial degradation of the hard tissues of the tooth). Infundibular decay may never extend into the surrounding dentin or apical tissues, but if the infundibular enamel is breached, possible consequences are: Direct extension into periapical tissues (periodontalligament and alveolar bone) Extension into the pulp-dentin complex resulting inendodontitis, pulp necrosis and apical infection Weakening of the tooth that results in pathologicalsagittal fracture through the infundibulae. As can be seen in the CT scan in Figure 15 in the article by Pearce (2016) and in the CT scan and CT reconstructions in Windley et al. (2009a,b), there can be marked pathology of the apical aspect of the infundibulum with little or no abnormality of the occlusal portion of the infundibulum. As in orthograde endodontic treatment, effective debridement, with bulbous apical enlargements is problematic (Hommez et al. 2002). In the young horse, nding feed impacted defects over multiple pulp horns of a maxillary cheek tooth is strong clinical evidence for an endodontic aetiology of apical infection that is often manifested clinically as facial swelling with or without cutaneous stula and/or nasal discharge due to Pu 3 + 5 RR 1 P42 B CP CB CLRMRCPC RLR5 3 412a) b) c) d) e) f) g) Fig 2: Axial anatomical section (a), axial (b) and coronal (e and f) CT images and 3D CT reconstructions of the enamel and pulp (c and g) and the pulp and infundibulum (d) of a Triadan 107 tooth with an eruption age of 1.5 years. The pulp is easily visible in (a) and(b). In (f) and (g) all ve horns can be seen to intercommunicate forming a common pulp chamber (CPC). Further apically the tooth divides into three roots, the largest of which is the medial root (MR) as visible in (g).

Similarly, passing a long endodontic le orthograde into an infundibulum and imaging penetrationinto the periapical area, or flushing saline into the infundibulum and documenting drainage from a cutaneousor nasal stula, would be convincing evidence for an underlying patent infundibulum aetiology. However, theabsence of occlusal abnormalities in an apically infectedmaxillary cheek tooth in a young horse does not necessarilymean that the aetiology is a patent infundibulum. Othercauses of infection predisposes to periodontaldisease and anachoresis (Dacre et al. 2008). Pearce (2016) has demonstrated in a small case series that clinical signs of apical infection in young horses,secondary to bacterial penetration of patent infundibulae,may resolve with orthograde infundibular debridement,placement of calcium hydroxide and restoration with acomposite material. However, the author correctly points outthat normal attrition will result in re-exposure of the moreapical, unrestored portion of the infundibulum to the oralcavity. Presently, even if the composite restoration of aninfundibular cavity does initially provide a leak-proof seal(which has not been adequately documented in the equinecheek tooth), the longevity is limited by the quality anddepth of this restoration. Once again, newly developedformulations of MTA may prove to be useful in the stagedrestoration of infundibular defects after appropriatedisinfection by debridement, irrigation with antibacterialsolutions and sterilisation with calcium hydroxide paste. In vitro testing of these techniques and materials ideally would precede further clinical application. In summary, the clinical cases presented by Lundstr \u20acom and Wattle (2016) and Pearce (2016) should be considered pilot studies. The favourable clinical results reported should justify further laboratory investigation, which may lead to well designed clinical trials to test the ef cacy of endodontic treatments in equine cheek teeth. Endodontic materials and procedures are quite technique-sensitive and have the potential for creating signi cant complications in unskilled hands. Common use in general practice is not yet warranted while specialists and researchers continue to explore endodontic and restorative solutions to apical and infundibular disease.

Skrzypczak\u00b6 Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Helsinki, Viikintie University of Helsinki, Finland;Department of Companion Animal Clinical Studies, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, South Africa; \u00a7Department of Veterinary Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Finland;#D\u20acoforsintie, Degerby, Finland; and\u00b6Food Safety Authority Evira, Research Summary This paper summarises the clinical ndings of 9 cases of disseminated alimentary mycobacteriosis in horses presented at a Finnish referral equine hospital 2009 -2014. Four of 9 horses were Standardbreds and 8/9 horses were male. The median age was 2 years, ranging from 6 months to 15 years. The duration of clinical signs before admission ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months. All horses demonstrated deterioration of the clinical signs after a protracted period of the disease and were nally subjected to euthanasia after poor response to multiple medical therapies. The most common complaints on admission were weight loss and diarrhoea (9/9), common clinicopathological abnormalities were hypoalbuminaemia and hyper brinogenaemia, which were present in all horses. Rectal biopsy specimens wereexamined from 5/9 horses and specimens were stained withZiehl-Nielsen (ZN). At rectal biopsy, mild multifocalneutrophilic or mild granulomatous proctitis was recognisedin all 5 horses, but the ZN stain for mycobacteria was positivein only one biopsy. A liver biopsy was taken from one horsein which hepatomegaly was observed clinically and revealedmarked granulomatous hepatitis with the presence ofmycobacteria. The rectal biopsy from this horse was ZNnegative. At post mortem examination, chronic, multifocal to coalescing granulomatous typhlocolitis and lymphadenitis were found in all horses with the small intestine less frequently involved. At histopathological examination of post mortem samples, a ZN stain was performed and intracellular acid-fast bacilli were identi ed in macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in the large intestine, liver and lymph nodes in 9/9horses and in the small intestine in 5/9 horses.Mycobacterium avium ssp. hominissuis was isolated in 5/9 horses from post mortem samples. Introduction Mycobacterial infections are rare in horses (Pavlik et al. 2008), probably because the horse appears to possess a strong innate resistance to mycobacterial infections (Mair 1996; Pavlik et al. 2004). Therefore an immunosuppressive state has been presumed to play a role in the development of the disease (Anzai et al. 1989; Gunnes et al. 1995). Most reported mycobacterial infections have occurred in mature horses(Perdue et al. 1991; Gunnes et al. 1995; Aupperle et al. 2008;Kriz et al. 2010). The most common species responsible for mycobacterial infections in horses are members of the Mycobacterium avium complex, including M. avium ssp. avium et al. 2008) ( Fig 1 ). In contrast to cattle, only experimental infections of M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis have been established in domesticated horses (Larsen et al. 1972), although the clinical signs in horses resemble Johne 's disease in cattle (Pavlik et al. 2004). A single case report of natural infection of M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis in a miniature donkey exists (Stief et al. 2012). In the case of intestinal mycobacteriosis in horses, the major clinical ndings are pyrexia, chronic diarrhoea and weight loss et al. 1988; Cline et al. 1991; Kriz et al. 2010). Mycobacteria of the M. avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) are ubiquitous in soil and are commonly found in animal feed and bedding (Biet et al. 2005). Members of the MAC have reservoirs in insects, protozoa and wild mammals (Biet et al. 2005). The mode of transmission for mycobacterial infections in horses is thought to be primarily via ingestion, although inhalation may also play a role (Pavlik et al. 2008). Mycobacteria of the MAC have been reported to cause generalised infections (Mair et al. 1986; Flores et al. 1991; Perdue et al. 1991; Gunnes et al. 1995; al. 2009; al. 2010), enterocolitis (Buergelt et al. 1988; Cline et al. 1991), (Pavlik et al. 2008), guttural pouch infections (Sills et al. 1990), ocular infections (Leifsson et al. 1997), abortions (Cline et al. 1991; H /C19elie and Higgins 1996) and septic arthritis (Hewes et al. 2005) in horses. Histologically, intestinal mycobacterial infections cause granulomatous enteritis (Meuten et al. 1978). Other reported causes of granulomatous enteritis in the horse include idiopathic granulomatous enteritis in young Standardbred horses (Lindberg 1984; Mair et al. 2006), exposure to aluminium (Fogarty et al. 1998), hypersensitivity reactions to dietary, parasitic or bacterial antigens (Roberts 1985), and hairy vetch toxicosis (Woods et al. 1992). Diagnosis of intestinal mycobacteriosis can be challenging. Mycobacteria are intracellular organisms and may not be detected in faeces (Lofstedt and Jakowski 1989). By contrast, mycobacteria can also be found in faeces of healthy horses (Oaks 2007). Traditional culture techniques are slow and therefore seldom used (Oaks 2007). The tuberculin test is unreliable as tests may be positive in up to 70% of clinically normal horses (Konyha and Kreier 1971). Molecular identi cation \u00a92015 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is diagnostic (Pavlik et al. 2008; Ryhner et al. 2009; Keck et al. 2010), and serology can also be used to identify a rising antibody titre to mycobacteria (Mair 1996). Intestinal mycobacteriosis manifests as a gastrointestinal syndrome but at post mortem examination the disease is often disseminated (Cline et al. 1991; Blahutkova et al. 2011). Mycobacteria have been identi ed from a liver biopsy of a horse with diarrhoea and weight loss (Lofstedt and Jakowski 1989). Rectal biopsy hasalso been recommended in cases of suspected intestinalmycobacteriosis (Pearson and Heidel 1998). This report describes 9 cases of disseminated alimentary mycobacteriosis in horses causing chronic diarrhoea andweight loss. Materials and methods Case material The clinical records of a Finnish referral equine practice from 2009 to 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Horses were included in the study if they had an ante mortem orpost mortem diagnosis of intestinal mycobacterial infection. The incidence of disseminated alimentary mycobacteriosis in our hospital population in 2014 was 0.1%. Clinical data The presenting complaint, duration and nature of the clinical signs, additional diagnostic procedures, treatment and outcome with post mortem ndings were recorded. Results The results are summarised in Table 1 . History and physical examination Eight horses were examined at the University of Helsinki Veterinary Teaching Hospital between 2009 and 2014. One horse ( Case 9 ) was treated by a referring veterinarian and was only submitted to the Veterinary Faculty for post mortem examination. Breeds were Standardbred (n =4), Finnhorse (n =3), Norwegian Fjord Horse (n =1) and Finnish Warmblood (n =1). Eight horses were male (5 stallions, 3 geldings) and one was amare. The median age was 2 years, ranging from 6 months to 15 years. The duration of clinical signs before admission ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months. All horses demonstrated deterioration of the clinical signs after a protracted period of disease. When the horses were examined for the rst time either at the veterinary hospital or, with Case 9 , at the home stable by the referring veterinarian, the most common complaints ( Table 1 ,Fig 2 ) were weight ( Case 2 ) presented with skin lesions, which included pyoderma of the head, pediculosis and ulceration of the lower lip. There were no clinical signs of mastitis in the only mare ( Case 4 ). Clinicopathological data Haematology and serum biochemical analysis were performed in all cases ( Table 1 ). Haematological abnormalities included leucocytosis in (range range [rr] mild 2/9 horses (range 3.97 -4.649109/l; rr 5.5 -12.19109/l). most common biochemical hypoalbuminaemia (range <10-24.9 g/l; rr <4.0 g/l), which were present in all cases. Globulin fractions were not measured. Other biochemical abnormalities included hypoproteinaemia in 4/9 horses - 1.2 mmol/l) and hypokalaemia in 2/9 horses (range 2.0 - 2.1 mmol/l; rr 3.0 -5.0 mmol/l). Four horses had elevations aspartate aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase). Venous blood gas performed in 5/9 horses. Abnormalities included uncompensated metabolic acidosis in 2/9 horses and compensated metabolic acidosis in 2/9 horses. Ancillary diagnostic tests Abdominal ultrasound examination was performed in 8/9 cases.

An abdominal radiograph was taken in 5/9 horses and sand accumulation was noticed in the ventral colon of two horses. A rectal examination was performed in 4/9 horses with no other unremarkable ndings than soft or fluidy faeces. Gastroscopy was performed in 3/9 horse and nonglandular gastric ulcers were identi ed in one horse at the margo plicatus ,curvatura major and curvatura minor . An oral glucose absorption test was performed in 3/9 horses and was normal (Mair et al. 1991). Faecal egg counts were performed in 6/9 horses and were negative. Three serial faecal samples were taken for Salmonella culture in 5/9 horses and were negative. Lawsonia intracellularis serology was performed in 1/9 horses and was faecal PCR for L. intracellularis was performed in and was negative. Faecalanalysis for Clostridium dif cile toxin was performed in one horse and was negative. Treatment and outcome Antimicrobials (6/9), anthelminthics (6/9), systemiccorticosteroids (6/9) and fluid therapy common therapeutic interventions. Antimicrobials that wereused included trimethoprim-sulfadiazine sodium penicillin (Geepenil Vet)1in one. All treatments were supportive or empirical, based on the list of differential diagnoses which included in flammatory bowel disease, neoplasia, cyathostominosis chronic salmonellosis, intestinal clostridiosis, protein enteropathy and Rhodoccous equi infection. In cases of mycobacteriosis diagnosed ante mortem (2/9), no treatment was initiated and euthanasia was recommended. In some horses there was clinical improvement after initiation of treatment; however, all horses were ultimately subjected to euthanasia based on clinical deterioration or ad e nitive ante mortem diagnosis of intestinal mycobacteriosis. Histopathology Rectal biopsy specimens were taken and examined in 5/9horses. Biopsies were xed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and stained with haematoxylin and evaluation. Specimens werealso stained Ziehl-Nielsen to evaluate neutrophilic or mild granulomatous proctitis was recognised in all ve horses, but the ZN stain was positivein only one biopsy ( Case 8 ), revealing rare acid fast bacilli within mucosal macrophages. In addition, a liver biopsy was taken from one horse in which hepatomegaly was observed clinically ( Case 3 ), and revealed marked granulomatous hepatitis with the presence of mycobacteria. The rectal biopsy from this horse was ZN negative. Post mortem examination All horses exhibited variable but severe cachexia. Soiling ofthe hind legs and perianal area with faecal wasconsistent with the clinical history of diarrhoea. Ascites and/orhydrothorax were present in 7 and 4 horses, respectively, andsubcutaneous ventral oedema was seen in 2 horses. Themesenteric and colonic lymph nodes were severely enlargedin all horses, and characterised by bulging of the cortex oncut surface and a central core of suppuration suggestingchronic abscessation. Involvement of gastric, splenic andhepatic lymph nodes was uncommon. Thoracic lymph nodeswere horses. Chronic, granulomatous typhlocolitis and lymphadenitis were striking ndings in all horses. Diffuse thickening of the submucosa and ill-de ned, coalescing white-grey granulomas with central necrosis were visible on the mucosal surface, suggestive of a severe diffuse granulomatous thyphlocolitis ( Fig 3 ). Gross lesions in the small intestine were seen less frequently and were usually milder and multifocal, consisting of thickening of the mucosa, erosions or well demarcated 1 -3 cm transmural granulomas. Lesions were con ned to the ileum (3/9) and the distal jejunum (2/9). The small colon exhibited similar lesions in only 2 horses (one of which had also a positive rectal biopsy). Intestinal wall oedema was prominent in 3/9 horses. Hepatomegaly and mild increase in liver consistency was observed in two horses but no grossly visible granulomas were detected. Additional gross ndings included multifocal in the only mare. Histopathological ndings in the large intestine and mesenteric and colonic lymph nodes were similar in all horses. The lamina propria and submucosa in all segments of the large intestine were markedly expanded by large numbers of epithelioid macrophages and lymphocytes with fewer plasma cells and variable numbers of multinucleated giant cells, consistent with a granulomatous thyphlocolitis Fig 3: Case 8: mucosal surface multifocal Ltd618 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016Elevate\u00ae is recommended for horses challenged by neurological disease and neuromuscular disorders.

In the liver, mild to moderate portal granulomatous hepatitis was identi ed in all horses, and in 4/9 horses randomly distributed granulomas associated with single hepatocyte necrosis were also observed ( Fig 5 and 6). Severe granulomatous lymphadenitis was present in all horses in grossly enlarged lymph nodes and in gastric associated lymphoid tissue. Mild granulomatous pneumonia was evident in 2/9 horses and in one horse the lesions were severe and extensive, forming multifocal coalescing granulomas. Based on the large numbers of epithelioid macrophages, a ZN stain was performed on the small and large intestine, liver, lung, spleen and lymph nodes. Intracellular acid-fast bacilli were identi ed in macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in the large intestine, liver and lymph nodes in 9/9 horses ( Figs 4 and 5) and in the small intestine in 5/9 horses. The large intestine and lymph nodes consistently exhibited very high numbers of organisms, while smaller numbers populated the liver. ZN stain of the spleen was negative in all horses and was positive in the lung of one horse (showing multifocal coalescing granulomas). Fresh samples for bacteriological examination were available from 5/9 horses. Samples submitted to the laboratory consisted of small and large intestine, lung, liver, spleen, heart, and mesenteric lymph nodes. After homogenisation with 0.9% NaCl, the suspension was decontaminated with hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2)i n nal concentration of 5%, neutralised with NaOH and centrifuged.The supernatant was decanted and the sediment wasinoculated into 2 different solid, modi ed L \u20acowenstein-Jensen media, with glycerol (Mycobacterium tube 1) or pyruvic acid (Mycobacterium tube 2) 1. Cultures in closed tubes were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and checked every second week for up to 3 months. ZN stain was positive both from tissue samples and from pure culture. The nal identi cation of the bacteria was performed by using a rapid DNA test, Accuprobe Mycobacterium avium5.Mycobacterium avium was isolatedfrom the large and small intestine, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and heart in 5/9 horses. PCRs for IS1245 (Guerrero et al. 1995) and IS901 (Kunze et al. 1991) were used to discriminate between avium ssp. ( Fig 1 ). Discussion The epidemiology of mycobacterial infections in horses remains elusive and it is unclear why some horses develop these rare infections. Mycobacteria are commonly found in animal feed and bedding (Oaks 2007). The incidence of mycobacterial infections in pigs in Germany caused by MAC members has been found to be as high as 10% in an area where pigs are bedded on peat (Durrling et al. 1998). Peat is a common bedding material used for horses in Finland and is one possible source for infection. In general, the source of infection in clinical cases is dif cult to determine due to the pervasive nature of mycobacterial organisms in the Fig 4: Large colon: numerous macrophages in the lamina propria containing intracellular bacteria epitheloidmacrophages (haematoxylin and negative. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd619 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016environment and the chronic nature of the disease, which makes accurate environmental sampling often impossible. Matlova et al. (2004) found the source of infection in pigs on one farm to be a kaolin supplement contaminated by surface water with matching strains found in the supplement and the affected pig 's lymph nodes. An immunosuppressive state has been presumed to play a role in the development of the disease (Anzai et al. 1989; Gunnes et al. 1995). Case 2 had intestinal parasites, ectoparasites, pyoderma and leucopenia, which may all be features of an immunosuppressive state (Perryman 2000). The late onset of endogenous IgGb production has been suggested as a predisposing factor for development of bacterial infections in foals aged 2 -5 months (Holznagel et al. 2003). In this report, 6/9 horses were aged 2 years and 3 of them were even younger than one year at the time of diagnosis. As the progression of mycobacterial disease is slow (Oaks 2007), it can be assumed that the younger animals in this series were infected at a young age. Kriz et al. (2010) reported 2 cases of M. avium hominissuis in young Fjord horse siblings. A genetic immunosuppressive state wassuspected with these horses. As intestinal mycobacteriosis isa rare syndrome, breed or sex predilection is currentlyunknown. In our case series, 8/9 horses were male and 4horses were Standardbreds. Standardbred horses arereported to be predisposed to granulomatous enteritis(Schumacher et al. 2000), and it is tempting to suggest that the large number of Standardbreds in our case series maysupport this fact. Granulomatous enteritis might beassociated with intrinsic disturbances of in flammatory defence mechanisms (Lindberg 1984) and a genetic predisposition for development of intestinal mycobacteriosis cannot be ruled out. Heritable variation in disease susceptibility for mycobacterial infections has been identi ed in cattle and deer (Jubb et al. 2007). The prevalence of mycobacterial infections in horses in Finland has never been reported and prevalence information from continental Europe is from the 1900s (Pavlik 2004). Case reports involving European horses are rare; however mycobacterial infections in horses are occasionally reported in abattoirs in Finland (M. Anttila, personal communication). The prevalence of tuberculous lesions caused by MAC members in slaughter pigs has increased 10-fold in Finland during the last decade (Ali-Vehmas et al. 2004). It is also our personal suspicion that the incidence of mycobacterial infections in horses in Finland is increasing. With the apparent rise in pig infections in Finland, a prevalence study for horses may be warranted. Mycobacterium avium hominissuis isolates from pigs and humans indicate close genetic ties (Tirkkonen et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2013). This suggests that M. avium hominissuis might be transmitted between pigs and humans, or that pigs and humans share common environmental sources of infection. M.avium hominissuis is a subspecies that has also been isolated from horses in the last decade (Kriz et al. 2010) and was the isolate found in 5/9 horses in this series. As far as the authors are aware, the genetic similarity between the strains in humans and horses has not been studied. Previously, the risk for transmission from equine to human beings has been considered to be small (Mair 1996; Pavlik 2004). All horses in our group demonstrated weight loss and diarrhoea on admission and 7/9 of the horses presented with pyrexia. In previous case reports of horses with intestinalmycobacteriosis, clinical ndings have been similar (Buergelt et and Jakowski 1989; Cline et al. 1991; Kriz et al. 2010). Immunosuppression is an important risk factor for human infections with members of the MAC (Xu et al. 2014). In human acquired immune de ciency syndrome patients suffering from disseminated MAC infections, the disease resembles that seen in horses: common clinical signs include fever, weight loss, diarrhoea, anaemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase (Havlik et al. 1992). Differential diagnoses to consider in young horses that present with weight loss and diarrhoea include L. intracellularis (Frazer 2008) and R. equi infection (Reuss et al. 2009; Shimizu et al. 2010). enteropathy (PE) caused by L. intracellularis infection in weanlings often presents with symptoms and blood parameters identical to intestinal mycobacteriosis (Frazer 2008), and is the most important differential to consider in young horses. Ultrasonographic changes in PE cases are characterised by small intestinal wall thickening (Kalck 2009) whereas with intestinal mycobacteriosis, intestinal wall thickening is not a consistent nding and can be seen in both the small and large intestine. Commercial faecal PCR and serology tests for Lawsonia are readily available (Pusterla and Gebhart 2009). Cyathostomiasis (Love et al. 1999), intestinal lymphoma (Mair et al. 1991), chronic salmonellosis (Feary and Hassel 2006), right dorsal colitis (Cohen 2002) and in flammatory bowel disease (Schumacher et al. 2000) should be considered as differential diagnoses in mature horses (Feary and Hassel 2006). Rectal biopsy is an important diagnostic tool indifferentiating these diseases as clinical signs and laboratory ndings can be identical regardless of the aetiology. Human acquired immune de ciency syndrome patients with MAC infections have signi cantly shortened survival rates. This has been associated with the patients 0severe loss of weight and immunosuppression caused by malnutrition (Horsburgh 1992). Horses in this series showed acute deterioration of the clinical signs after a history of more chronic disease. This could be explained either by dissemination of the infection or by the malaise caused by end-stage disease. Rectal biopsy has been recommended in cases of suspected intestinal mycobacteriosis (Pearson and Heidel 1998). In the present case series, out of 5 rectal biopsies performed, only one showed positivity in ZN stain, and even in this single case, mycobacteria was so scarce, that an exhaustive search was required. Rectal biopsy ndings have only been described in 2 cases of intestinal mycobacteriosis (Buergelt et al. 1988) and although granulomatous proctitis can be readily diagnosed, mycobacterium organisms are not always found. The results of our study show that even when speci c diagnostic procedures are carried out, mycobacteria are not always identi ed, and intestinal mycobacteriosis cannot be ruled out on the basis of negative rectal biopsy result. The use of liver biopsy for the detection of mycobacteria may be an important ante mortem diagnostic tool considering that hepatic lesions were present in almost every report of equine mycobacteriosis (Buergelt et al. 1988; Sills et al. 1990; Chiers et al. 2012). In all 9 cases presented in this article, granulomatous hepatitis was readily evident on histology and all liver sections were positive on ZN stain. Identi cation of mycobacterium in a liver biopsy been reported once (Lofstedt 1989). Mycobacteria stain readilywith ZN, but can with EQUINE / AE / NOVEMBER 2016In 3 cases ( 1, 2 and 3), the submandibular lymph nodes were enlarged, thus a biopsy or aspirate of these lymph nodes might have been useful samples for histology or PCR. Amemori et al. (2004) found a technique of intestinal lymph node biopsy with laparoscopic approach in cows suffering from Johne 's disease technically challenging; however, this technique is conceivably possible in the horse. The DNA- and RNA-based methods established by Pakarinen et al. (2007) may be utilised for detection of mycobacteria of the MAC in a variety of materials such as soil, plant materials, food and animal tissue specimens. With the problems of culturing mycobacteria and the current uncertainty of the serological tests, PCR and histopathology represent a viable method for diagnosis of intestinal mycobacteriosis. All mycobacterial infections involving multiple organ systems in horses have been reported to be fatal (Mair et al. 1986; Buergelt et al. 1988; Sills et al. al. 2008; Ryhner et al. 2009; Keck et al. 2010). Macrolides combined with rifampin are recommended rst choices for antimicrobial treatment for equine mycobacterial infections (Weese 2009). In human MAC infections the use of macrolides has been shown to be crucial in cases that show response to treatment (Xu et al. 2014). Kriz et al. (2010) treated a yearling Fjord horse diagnosed with M. avium hominissuis infection with clarithromycin and rifampin for 4 months without success.Cases 7 and 9showed no improvement in clinical signs or signi cant improvement in blood parameters despite long courses of antibiotics. In our opinion, the use of broad spectrum antimicrobials in a disease with documented poor prognosis should be taken into serious consideration. In Finland, the national legislation constrains the use of rifampin to only foals with R. equi infection. Systemic corticosteroids can temporarily attenuate the clinical syndrome: Kriz et al. 's case (2010) and horses in this series treated with corticosteroids showed some improvement in their condition; however, all horses subsequently deteriorated. This report provides evidence to support the hypothesis that mycobacteria are aetiological agents of in flammatory bowel disease and may have a role in the pathogenesis of equine granulomatous enteritis. Further research on prevalence of disease in horses is warranted. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

S. Weese* and D. Gomez-Nieto Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, particularly those of the Mycobacterium avium complex, appear to be increasing in some species. While still an apparently rare disorder more common in immunocompromised individuals, changes in the apparent epidemiology of disease in man raise concerns about similar changes in horses. A recent case series describing infections in 9 predominantly immunocompetent horses demonstrates the potential for nontuberculous mycobacteria to be relevant equine pathogens and raises many questions about the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of disease in horses. The area of infectious diseases is an evolving eld in equine medicine as it is in other species. Changes may occurbecause of alterations in pathogen range, emergence ofantimicrobial resistance and emergence of new pathogens.Changes also occur because of improvements in the abilityto identify some pathogens and advances in diagnosticmethods often give rise to questions about whether a diseaseis increasing in incidence or whether we are simply betterable to diagnose it. Fastidious organisms such asmycobacteria fall into this group and the case series ofdisseminated alimentary mycobacteriosis in this issue (M \u20aconki et al. 2016) highlights some important issues for the equine clinician to consider. One question that often arises about published case series is whether they describe a clinically important issue or acollection of rare cases that most clinicians will neverencounter. Mycobacterial infections are uncommonlyreported in horses; yet, while horses have been consideredrelatively resistant to this broad genus of bacteria, this caseseries demonstrates the fact that serious infections cancertainly occur. Whether these are truly rare vs. rarelydiagnosed or rarely reported remains to be seen. Mycobacteria can be challenging, microbiologically, diagnostically and therapeutically. This is particularly true of'nontuberculous mycobacteria '(NTM), a group also known by names such as 'atypical mycobacteria 'and 'mycobacteria other than tuberculosis '. Nontuberculous mycobacteria have a history of confusing and variable nomenclature that is only recently being clari ed through use of sequence-based methods. This diverse group of acid-fast bacteria consists of mycobacteria other than those of the M. tuberculosis complex (which includes M. bovis ) and those that cause leprosy ( M. leprae and M. lepromatosis ). Its members are essentially ubiquitous in the environment, including food and water, illustrating the highly opportunistic nature of NTM infections and complicating understanding ofthe epidemiology of disease. While most often regarded in human medicine as uncommon pathogens largely causing disease in compromised hosts (e.g. individuals with acquired immune de ciency syndrome [AIDS]), increasing attention is now being paid to NTM, particularly those of theMycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Some members of this group, such as M. avium hominissuis, identi ed in this case series, can affect a range of animal species causing serious and often initially insidious disease. This case series raises many questions. One is \"Are NTM infections increasing? \"This is virtually impossible to answer. Limitations in diagnostic testing are one reason why there are signi cant knowledge gaps about their ecology and role in disease in horses. The authors of the case series indicated an impression that the incidence of mycobacterial infections in horses has been increasing in Finland. Interestingly, one of theauthors of this commentary (J.S.W.) has had a similar impression of increases in mycobacterial infections in animals in Canada. Whether the observation of the authors of theaccompanying article and others are because of a true increase in the incidence of infection, use of better diagnostic tests or increased communication of results is unclear and warrants study. Certainly, our ability to diagnose and characterise NTM infections has increased with better diagnostic tests including PCR to detect and speciate mycobacteria. Whether that is the main explanation is unclear. It may also be useful to consider the epidemiology of NTM infections in man. Various recent reports indicate an increase in the incidence of NTM infections in man (Kendall et al. 2010; Adjemian et al. 2012; Ignatov al. 2013; Prevots and Marras 2015), something that has been attributed to a true increase in disease, not improved testing or reporting. Therefore, while a case series such as is published here provides limited insight into the epidemiology of disease, a preponderance of the scienti c and anecdotal evidence suggest that equine clinicians should be aware of potential increases in NTM infections in horses. As investigation is furthered in human medicine, equine medicine should remain abreast of new information since there could be related changes in horses. The susceptible patient population is important to consider for any infectious disease. Traditionally, most NTM infections in man and animals have been associated with immunocompromised individuals (Grif th et al. 2007), although infections may be increasing in immunocompetent individuals (Piersimoni and Scarparo 2008). While immune status can be dif cult to assess, this case series suggests that overt immunosuppression is not needed for development of NTM infections in horses as there was little to no evidence of a compromising disorder in most affected horses. This highlights the need to continually revisit assumptions about infectious diseases and to avoid ruling out NTM infectionsbased on factors such as young age and lack of a detectable comorbidity. Another question raised by this report is how, or even if, NTM infections should be treated in horses. Treatment of mycobacterial disease is notoriously dif cult because of the \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd623 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016nature of the bacteria, types of disease that occur, potentialpresence of underlying problems and because disease istypically advanced by the time of diagnosis. Combinations ofantimicrobials are recommended and these usually includeantimicrobials listed by the World Health Organization asCategory 1 because of their importance for the treatment oftuberculosis and other infections diseases in man. Longdurations of treatment are required with months to years oftreatment recommended for some manifestations in man(Gordin and Horsburgh 2005). Essentially nothing is knownabout duration of treatment in horses but there is no reasonto assume that short-term therapy would be effective. Thisraises questions pertaining to antimicrobial stewardship aswere posed by the authors of the case series. Speci cally, is it reasonable to treat horses with combinations of drugs thatare important in human medicine for prolonged periods oftime, especially when the prognosis is guarded? There is nosimple answer to that question and it is incumbent on theclinician to consider the horse 's welfare, prognosis for approval, ability to identify (and manage) any predisposing factors, ability of the owner to consistently administer drugs for the entire treatment course, the willingness of the owner to pay for prolonged treatment and public health implications of antimicrobial resistance. If an owner cannot commit to a proper and full treatment course, it is reasonable to consider any attempt at treatment inappropriate. Another question raised is \"Are horses a potential source of NTM in man? \"That remains unanswered. Since the same species of NTM cause infections in man and animals, it is unsurprising that concerns about zoonotic transmission might occur. Yet, as ubiquitous environmental organisms, horses and man are most likely infected by similar sources rather than transmitting NTM between each other (Falkinham 2009). What can the equine clinician take home from this case series? One important concept is recognition that NTM infections can occur and they should be considered in horses with nonspeci c disease, particularly when usual causes have been ruled out or when typically successful treatments have failed. While 'common diseases occur commonly 'and testing every horse with gastrointestinal disease for NTM would be illogical, one must not lose sight of the potential for uncommon and less readily diagnosed diseases to be present. While diagnosis can be challenging, simple measures such as ensuring that acid-fast stains are performed can help speed diagnosis. It is possible that NTM infections are truly rare in horses and predominantly occur in immunocompromised animals. However, it is also possible that infections are being missed and that the epidemiology of disease is changing. It is unlikely that NTM will be common pathogens in horses but better infectious disease monitoring and communications are important for a range of endemic and emerging diseases and further tracking of NTM infections is warranted. Clinicians should also consider the antimicrobial stewardship questions discussed above. This Journal has taken a proactiveapproach to antimicrobial stewardship with its antimicrobial stewardship policy and NTM infections are yet another reason for consideration and dialogue. While they may be increasing, infections by NTM will presumably remain a rarity in both general and referral practice. Yet, clinicians must be aware of the potential for unusual (or at least unusually diagnosed) infections. Authors 'declaration of interest No con flicts of interest have been declared.

P. Robert, A. Main de Boissiere, M. C. Depecker, C. de Fourmestraux, G. prolapse has been attributed to conditions generating tenesmus or increasing abdominal pressure in both horses anddonkeys. This report presents the case of a 7-year-old geldeddonkey that sustained a type IV rectal prolapse secondary to a long-standing cystic calculus after several episodes ofintermittent mucosal prolapse. Rectal prolapse was addressedfirst on an emergency basis by colorectostomy. After medicalstabilisation, pain and straining management with repeatedepidural drug administrations, a laparoscopic-assistedcystotomy was performed one week later to remove thecalculus. The donkey was discharged and resumed his normallife at pasture. Introduction Rectal prolapse in horses is often secondary to conditionscausing tenesmus such as diarrhoea, intestinal parasitism,colitis and abdominal urinary obstruction, colic,retained fetal membranes, rectal tumour or foreign body.Mares are reportedly more affected than males (Turner andFessler 1980; Schumacher 2002; Freeman 2012; Archer 2013;Dallap Schaer and 2014). Type I rectal prolapse involves only rectal mucosa and submucosa protruding through theanal sphincter. Type II represents a full thickness prolapse of the whole rectal ampulla or a portion of it. Types I and IIare the most commonly encountered. In a type III rectal prolapse, part of the small colon is intussuscepted into the rectum, withoutbeing protruded through the anus, whereas in a type IV rectal prolapse, the peritoneal rectum and part of the small colonintussuscept beyond the anus. This latter type is mostly found indystocic mares (Turner Fessler 1980; Schumacher and Orsini 2014). The prognosis isgood for types I and II, but guarded to poor for types III and IV due to mesenteric and vascular injury. Indeed, a descendingmesocolon rupture should be suspected as soon as theprolapse is longer than 30 cm. Furthermore, the anal sphincteritself may impair the venous return Dallap Schaer and Orsini2014). Rectal prolapse is more common in donkeys than in horses, without any sex or age predisposition (Desmaizi\u00e8res 2006). It isoften seen in working animals due diarrhoea, malnutrition,overloading, or heavy strongyle or Gasterophilus spp. parasitism. Most described cases are type et al . 1990; Abd El-Karim 1995; al . 2012). Persistent cough and a cystic calculus have been associatedwith recurrent rectal prolapse in a burro jack, necessitating a laparocystotomy (Snyder et al . 1985). However , little is known about rectal prolapse in companion donkeys. This report presents a case of type IV rectal prolapse secondary to a chronic cystic calculus in a 7-year-old donkeysuccessfully treated by colorectostomy and subsequentlaparoscopic-assisted cystotomy. Case history A 157 kg 7-year-old donkey gelding was referred to the ONIRISEquine Clinic for treatment of a severe rectal prolapse of atleast 6 hours' duration. The donkey lived on pasture, wascurrently vaccinated against tetanus and had beendewormed about 6 months earlier with fenbendazole(Panacur) 1. Several episodes of straining, tenesmus, pollakiuria and stranguria had been noticed for approximately 10months. Short-lasting and self-limiting prolapses of the rectalmucosa had been observed on several occasions. Clinicalexamination, blood and urine analysis performed by thereferring veterinarian at the beginning of the above-mentioned clinical signs revealed no significant abnormalities.On the day of referral, the donkey was found lying down in hisfield, with a 50 cm-long rectal prolapse. Manual reduction bythe referring veterinarian was unsuccessful. Initial treatmentincluded 250 mg of flunixin meglumine (Meflosyl) 2and a hyoscine (400 mg;Estocelan) 3administered i.v. just before referral. Clinical findings Upon presentation, the donkey was in moderate to severepain, depressed, shivering and trying to lie down. Mucousmembranes were tacky and hyperaemic, with a capillary refilltime of 2 s; heart rate was 80 beats/min; extremities were cold;respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min. A 50 cm-long type IV rectal prolapse, with oedematous, red to purple colour andtorn mucosa in several locations was seen hanging down tothe level of mid-tibia ( Fig 1 ). It was not possible to take a rectal temperature. During clinical examination, the donkey brieflyurinated, then urine drops were seen draining continuouslyfrom the distal urethra. Results of haematological analysis are presented in Table 1 . Briefly, a complete blood count revealed moderate leucocytosis, moderate haemoconcentration and a severehyperlactataemia, consistent with tissue hypoxia. Urinary strips performed on spontaneous revealed marked pigmenturia (3+) and glucosuria (4+),consistent less were on urinalysis. EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016Abdominal ultrasonography showed mildly decreased intestinal motility. Kidneys and urethra appeared normal. Theurinary bladder was not visible on initial examination and wasdeemed empty. Abdominocentesis yielded a clear yellow fluid consistent with a modified transudate containing 1.37 \u00d710 9cells/l, 20 g/l of total proteins and increased peritoneal lactateconcentration at 7.2 mmol/l. Diagnosis Based on the results of the clinical examination, a type IV rectal prolapse with haemorrhagic strangulation of theprotruded small colon and rectum was diagnosed. Even if a primary urinary lesion had been suspected, based on thehistory and urinalysis, it could not be evaluated at that time. Avery guarded prognosis was given but the owner agreed tosurgical treatment of the rectal prolapse. Treatment Standing resection and anastomosis of the rectal prolapseAfter and was placed in a padded induction stall in case general anaesthesiabecame necessary due to pain and inability to remainstanding. The area at the base of the tail and the caudalgluteal region were clipped and aseptically prepared. Theprolapsed mucosa was (20mg, Rompun) 4, 20 mg of morphine (Morphine Aguettant)6for a total volume of 3 ml, were injected epidurally in the secondintercoccygeal space using an 18 gauge hypodermic needle.After infiltration in the anal sphincter with additional the rectal prolapse was treated by resectionand anastomosis as described by Turner and Fessler (1980) andFreeman (2012). Briefly, two 13 gauge catheter stylets wereinserted perpendicularly in the anal sphincter and healthymucosa at the 1 and 4 o'clock positions to maintain theprolapse during dissection. The stylets were slightly precurvedto expedite this operation and to prevent a deep insertion intothe gluteal muscles. Progressive circumferential full thicknessincisions were made in the outer and inner wall of theintussusceptum, one third at a time, starting with a No. 24scalpel blade and pursuing with Mayo scissors. When bleedingmesenteric vessels encountered, 1 polydioxanone in an interrupted full thicknesshorizontal mattress pattern. These steps were repeated for thewhole circumference until all necrotic tissue was removed.Mucosal edges were then apposed with 2-0 glycomer in asimple continuous pattern, interrupted 3 times around thecircumference ( Figs 2 and 3). Finally, swabs impregnated with Fig 1: Aspect of the rectal prolapse and intussuscepted small colonon admission.TABLE 1: Haematological and biochemical results of the donkeyupon admission.

Faecal samples from the resected small colon were sent for coproscopic analysis. The donkey was returned to his stall, and administered 1.5 l of mineral oil via nasogastric intubation. Fluid therapy wasinstituted with 3 ml/kg solutioncomplemented and potassium rate infusion of lidocaine was initiated (1.3 mg/kgbwt bolus followed by 50 g/kg bwt/min) to provide additional analgesia. Hospitalisation The following constant rate infusionwere continued. After being kept off-feed for 12 h, grazing wasslowly reintroduced after another nasogastric administration ofmineral oil (1.5 l). Regular urine dripping was observed, as wellas straining efforts. Urinary catheterisation was performed withdifficulty, yielding only a small blood-tinged urine.Coproscopy showed 744 strongyle eggs/g faeces. Acystoscopic examination was performed 36 h after correctionof the rectal prolapse, and revealed a large cystic calculus(Fig 4 ). Consent was obtained from the owner to perform a cystotomy as soon as the donkey's condition would allowgeneral anaesthesia and the anastomosis judged to befunctional. Clinical status kept improving despite a transitoryepisode of hyperlipidaemia (maximum triglyceridaemia 7.7 g/l) treated with administration. antimicrobials administered, omeprazole (Gastrogard) 7 4 mg/kg bwt q. 24 h orally was added to the treatmentsbecause of bruxism, and a linseed oil complement(Transitonix) 8was for its laxative and energising properties. Grazing time and frequency were also increased. About 60 hafter the surgery, faecal output resumed with soft faeces.Because of persistent tenesmus and recurrence of mucosalprolapse during urination and defaecation, an epiduralcatheter (Epidural pain management system) 9was placed in the largest and most palpable (second) intercoccygeal spaceand 10 mg mg/kg weekafter prolapse resection and anastomosis, the donkey'sclinical status was improved, passing faeces regularly, buttenesmus increased in frequency, so cystic calculus removalwas planned. Laparoscopic-assisted cystotomy The surgery was performed as described by R\u00f6cken et al . (2006) in horse geldings. Seven days after the donkey was positioned in dorsalrecumbency under isoflurane in oxygen in a semiclosed circlesystem with positive pressure ventilation. A sterile urinarycatheter was inserted into the bladder and the ventralabdomen and inguinal area were clipped, asepticallyprepared and draped. A 2 cm skin incision was performed atthe umbilicus and a 10 mm pyramidal trocar-cannula unit wasinserted into the abdomen. The a30 10 mm-wide 0\u00b0 laparoscope and abdominalinsufflation to was obtained. The surgery table waspositioned in Trendelenburg position, an instrument portal wascreated 3 cm axial to the left external inguinal ring, and atrocar-cannula unit inserted under laparoscopic control. Thepreviously performed anastomosis was not observed. Alaparoscopic Babcock forceps was introduced through thisportal and the apex of the bladder was grasped and broughtto the inguinal area ( Fig 5 ). Because of the thickened bladder wall, several attempts were necessary to perform this latterstep, and enlargement of the parainguinal incision to 8 cmwas necessary to insert 3 Allis tissue forceps to stretch thebladder and reach the skin level ( Fig 6 ). Two seromuscular cruciate sutures of 2 polyglactin 910 were used as stay suturesand laparotomy sponges were placed around theparainguinal incision. The table was returned to a horizontal Fig 3: Intraoperative view of thecolorectal anastomosis. (a) Fullthickness horizontal mattress now simplecontinuous suture of the mucosa. NOVEMBER 2016position and the cystotomy was performed. A 6 cm round adherent type I cystic calculi was removed with sponge forceps. Smaller pieces were extracted in a similar way. Sterilesaline was instilled into the bladder via the urinary catheter forlavage and a suction device was used to limit spillage of fluid.Finally the cystotomy incision was closed Lembert pattern of 2-0 polyglactin 910, theparainguinal incision was closed in 4 layers, and the umbilicalincision in 2 layers. Total surgical time was 105 min. Recoverywas uneventful. Outcome Administration of cefquinome and flunixin meglumine werecontinued for 3 and 5 more days, respectively. Frequency andintensity of straining decreased quickly after calculus removaland the epidural catheter was taken out 3 days after thesecond surgery. Urination returned to normal in frequency andvolume. The donkey was discharged 4 days after thecystotomy with moderate ventral oedema. The owners wereasked to continue the linseed oil complement and to put thedonkey in a small paddock for one month, favouring a grassand wet hay diet, supplemented with oral salt to encouragewater intake (Schott and Woodie 2012). A deworming plan was also suggested. On telephone follow-up, the ventraloedema subsided in a couple of days. The donkey returned tohis normal routine and was still healthy 12 months after thesurgery. Owners and referring veterinarian were very pleasedwith the donkey's outcome. Discussion Even if urinary tract obstruction is a reported cause of rectalprolapse in equids (Turner and Fessler 1980), the authors areonly aware of one report of cystic calculus in a male donkeycontributing to a rectal prolapse (Snyder et al . 1985). The case described here presented with a 50 cm-long intussusceptumprotruding through the anus and a history of intermittent rectalprolapse and dysuria of 10 months' duration. After the initialwork-up, a urinary tract disorder was suspected but notconfirmed due to the inability to perform a rectal palpation,and the decision was made to treat the rectal prolapse first asan emergency procedure. The colorectostomy wasperformed under standing sedation and epidural anaesthesia,as described previously (Turner and Fessler 1980; Freeman2012). A simple adaptation of the technique was theprebending of the stylets used to cross-pin the anal sphincter inorder to enter and exit the anal skin without interfering with theadjacent gluteal muscles. Given the visual aspect and lengthof protruding intestine, damage to the descending mesocolonand associated vasculature was likely and manual reductionof the prolapse was not attempted (Schumacher 2002). In similar equine cases, mostly parturient mares, prognosis after surgical treatment is usually poor , mainly because ofanastomosis leakage and small colon vascular compromise(Turner and Fessler 1980). When a type IV prolapse is manually reduced, critical follow-up is mandatory to detect signs ofintestinal necrosis as early as possible, performing repeatedabdominocentesis and evaluation of peritoneal fluid whiteblood cell count and total protein concentration. If ischaemicnecrosis of the small colon is suspected, laparoscopy is anefficient way to quickly assess the location and degree of smallcolon damage. It may help the clinician to determine whichsurgery is indicated, either celiotomy with associated resectionand anastomosis if deemed feasible, or colostomy (Ragleet al . 1997). The latter procedure was successful when associated with resection of the ischaemic part of the smallcolon and rectum and creation of a blind stump of the distalrectum through the anal sphincter (Espinosa Buschiazzo et al . 2010). Post operative was similar to Freeman's (2012) recommendations. Flunixin meglumine andcefquinome were given at the recommended dosage fordonkeys, with progressive decrease in nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drug administration (Catling et al . 2008). The donkey was kept off feed for 12 h before hand grazing wasgradually reintroduced. In addition, mineral oil followed bylinseed oil were administered as laxatives. Gut motility resumedquickly and soft faeces were obtained within 60 h. Animportant part of the therapeutic plan relied on epiduralanalgesia provided via an epidural catheter. This allowed along-term pain relief and a decrease in straining effort duringhealing of the anastomosis and patient's medical stabilisation.In donkeys, epidural injections are more easily performed inthe second intercoccygeal space with a 30\u00b0 angle because itis wider than the first, commonly used in horses (Burnham2002). A combination of xylazine and morphine was elected Fig 5: Laparoscopic-assisted cystotomy. The apex of the bladder isgrasped with laparoscopic Babcock forceps and brought to theinguinal region. Fig 6: Picture illustrating the relative positions of the umbilicallaparoscopic portal and the parainguinal mini-laparotomyincision. The red arrowhead depicts the position of the superficialinguinal ring. Cranial is to the right. \u00a92015 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016 628for their complementary kinetics: xylazine is a fast acting analgesic drug with a moderate duration of action and localanaesthetic properties, particularly suitable to relieve thetenesmus, whereas morphine needs up to 5 h before onset ofaction depending on injection location and targeted spinalsegments but lasts for 8-12 h. Furthermore, epidural morphinehas minimal effects on gut motility in equids (Sano et al . 2011). However , tenesmus reappeared despiteepidural analgesia, with intermittent mucosal prolapse,surgical removal of the calculus was decided. An increase inepidural drugs dosing regimen may have allowed a bettermanagement of the tenesmus. Prevalence of urolithiasis in horses is between 0.11 and 0.8%, which is similar to reported values for donkeys,approximately 0.6% (Laverty et al . Male equids, particularly geldings, are more commonlyaffected than females, with the bladder being the mostcommon location for uroliths. Two types of stones can befound in horses. Type I uroliths are the most common. Green-yellow, spiculated and easily fragmentable, they arecomposed of calcium carbonate salts. Type II uroliths are much harder , with a grey-white smooth surface. They containmagnesium and phosphorus in addition to calcium carbonate(Foley et al . 2009; Schott and Woodie 2012). Multiple techniques of cystolith removal have been described inhorses. This may reflect the paucity of cases as well as thedifficulty of performing a cystotomy in the mature horse (Wattsand Fubini 2013). perineal have been described(Laverty et 2009; Woodie 2012; Hawkins 2013). Recently, efforts have beenmade to reduce the invasiveness of the procedure byintroducing laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted techniques,either standing or under sedatedhorses (Ragle 2002; . 2013; Vitte et al . 2013). Even if the latter techniques, particularly electrohydraulic lithotripsy, have become the first treatmentoption for certain surgeons (R\u00f6cken 2013), they requireexpensive equipment, are time consuming, do not allowfragmentation of all calculi and still carry risks of complications(R\u00f6cken et al . 2012; Hawkins 2013; Reichelt and Lischer 2013). The laparoscopic-assisted technique was elected in our casebecause it combines the advantages of the parainguinallaparocystotomy (avoidance of the major abdominal wallvessels and lesser dead space compared with the medianapproach) with those of the laparoscopic technique(excellent visualisation of the bladder and small incisions).However , even if this technique facilitates surgery when thebladder is thickened and inflamed from chronic cystitis(R\u00f6cken et al . 2006), we experienced difficulties in bladder exteriorisation through the parainguinal incision. Similarproblems have been recently described and attributed toanatomic differences of the donkey pelvic canal and inguinalregion (Watts and Fubini 2013). Another explanation would bea spasm of the bladder muscle and adherence to the calculusbecause of the long-standing cystolith and associated cystitis(Russell and Pollock 2012). It is possible that a more caudal oraxial incision, than the usual 2-3 cm medial and parallel to theleft external inguinal ring, would have been more appropriatein this case. Another option would have been to distend thebladder with local anaesthetic and saline solution before surgery, as described by Russell and Pollock (2012), or tointravenously infuse a large volume of fluid preoperatively,combined with diuretics administration, as suggested byHawkins (2013). The only observed complication in our casewas self-limiting mild incisional and ventral oedema, asobserved al . (2006). The role of strongyle infestation in this donkey remains unclear as he had been regularly dewormed beforepresentation. It might be either an incidental finding or aworsening factor for the rectal prolapse, as previously reported(Dhoble et al . 1990). Interestingly, the case of rectal prolapse reported by Snyder et al . (1985) never showed any tenesmus or dysuria, leading to the hypothesis that severe coughing could havebeen an initiating factor. In the present case, it is probable thatthe cystolithiasis induced stranguria and tenesmus, which wereresponsible for the intermittent rectal prolapse observed for 10months before presentation and ultimately led to a type IV irreversible rectal prolapse. It is speculated that donkeys cantolerate long-standing painful and pathological processesmore than horses because of their higher pain threshold. In children, cystolithiasis have been associated with rectal prolapse as well, mainly because of vigorous straining duringurination. Similar 2-step surgical procedures have beendescribed to treat affected and Amawi 2010). Finally, it is worthwhile to note that both working and companion donkeys share some common problems, such asrectal prolapse, despite radically different living conditions. Thismay suggest either susceptibility in all donkey breeds ormaladjusted management of occidental donkeys(deworming, feeding, housing). However , owners of the latterare probably more likely to use early and aggressivetreatments, offering the donkey a better prognosis.

Lynch Peterson and Smith Equine Hospital, Ocala, Florida, USA.*Corresponding Summary Rupture of the urinary bladder is rare in adult horses with various standing or recumbent surgical repair techniqueshistorically reported as the treatments of choice. This caseseries describes the successful conservative management ofcystorrhexis in 4 adult horses. Conservative management istherefore a potentially viable treatment option which forgoesthe risks of general anaesthesia and may reduce the postoperative complications associated with surgery of thebladder. Introduction Rupture of the urinary bladder is relatively uncommon in theadult horse (Jones et al . 1996; Rodgerson 1999; Stephen et al 2009; Jenei 2012) with reported incidence of 0.01% in post partum broodmares (Higuchi et al . 2002). adult horses, factors for cystorrhexis includeparturition (Nyrop . 1989; Gibson et al . 1992), trauma (Beck et al . 1996), penile haematoma in geldings (Firth 1976) cystorrhaphy for a previouscystorrhexis (Pankowski and Fubini 1987). To date, most reported treatments of traumatic cystorrhexis in adult horses have involved some form of surgical repair ofthe bladder wall defect (White 1977; Rodgerson et et al . 2009). However , exteriorisation and surgical repair of the bladder in adult horses through a ventralceliotomy can be difficult due to its intrapelvic location anddepth of the equine abdomen (Gibson 1999; Schott and Woodie 2012). Adequate exteriorisation may sometimes even be impossible, particularly if the locationof the tear is near the neck of the bladder (Higuchi et al . 2012). Additionally, general anaesthesia carries inherent risks,particularly in the periparturient broodmare. Anaesthesia maybe further complicated with electrolyte derangementsassociated with uroperitoneum. These difficulties have led tothe development of standing surgical approaches for repair ofruptured bladders which attempt to afford the surgeongreater access to the area of interest (Rodgerson et al . 1999; Stephen et al . 2009; Higuchi et al . 2012). Standing surgical repair techniques have been associated with post operativecomplications, including urine pooling and dribbling afterurethral sphincterotomy (White 1977) and complications withwound healing after and suturing damaged vaginalmucosa in post parturient mares (Rodgerson et al . 1999). Documented accounts of successful conservativemanagement in equids have been sparse, with one geldingmanaged with the aid of a perineal urethrotomy (Gibson et al . 1992), one colt foal managed with an indwelling urinarycatheter (Lavoie and Harnagel 1988) and one mare in whichthe tear was experimentally created (Genetzky and Hagemoser 1985). However , spontaneous healing of dorsallylocated bladder tears following placement of a transurethralurinary catheter has been reported in mature cows (Fubini2004). One study reported successful medical managementof cats following the creation of iatrogenic rents in thebladder wall with the aid of an indwelling urinary catheter(Osborne et al . 1996). Another reported 3 of 14 dogs with experimentally-induced cystorrhexis had successful repairrecorded within 45 h without any treatment (Burrows andBovee 1974). Despite such knowledge of conservative treatment, surgical repair has continued to be advocated as thetreatment of choice in the horse by most clinicians (Rodgersonet al . 1999; Schott and Woodie 2012). The purpose of the following report is to document the successful conservativemedical management of cystorrhexis in 3 mares and one colt. Case details Case 1 A 15-year-old full term Thoroughbred mare was admitted forobservation of foaling. Two days later , the mare initiated firststage labour. Due to prolonged second stage labour , assistedvaginal delivery was attempted; however , this wasunsuccessful. The mare was anaesthetised and placed in theTrendelenburg position by elevating the hindquarters with ahoist and the foal delivered using controlled vaginal delivery.Twenty-four hours following delivery, the mare displayed mildsigns of colic and had a visibly distended abdomen.Abdominal ultrasonography revealed voluminous hypoechoicperitoneal free fluid (PFF). hyperkalaemia a suspicion of urinary tract rupture,cystoscopy was performed. An approximately 5 cm tearsurrounded by an area of necrosis was seen in the ventralcaudal bladder wall at the level of the ureteric ostia. Treatment A 26 French (F) Foley catheter 1was placed transurethrally into the urinary bladder using an aseptic technique and the bulbinflated with 60 ml of sterile saline. A 32F chest tube 2was placed into the peritoneal cavity at the ventral most aspect ofthe abdomen, 5 cm to the right of midline, as described (Reusset al . 2006). Approximatel y2lo yellow fluid drained \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd631 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016from the peritoneal cavity. The abdomen was lavaged using 10 l Normosol-R3twice daily for 4 days through the ventral abdominal drain. The drain was not occluded after instillationof fluid and was allowed to continuously drain. The peritonealdrain was replaced caudally after 2 days due to poor return oflavage fluid. Poor return was noted again on Day 4 and thedrain removed. The urinary catheter was changed every 3days. Both the abdominal drain and urinary catheter weremaintained with a semi-closed system using a condomsecured to the distal portion with the end removed to allowcontinuous drainage of fluid and prevent aspiration of air.Serum biochemistry and haematology were monitored dailyand by Day 5 post partum , all values were within normal limits; however , the mare remained hospitalised for a further 10 daysdue to endometritis and laminitis. These complications werelikely associated with a retained placenta. While hospitalised,the mare was maintained on intravenous (i.v.) balancedelectrolyte solution (Normosol-R 10 1.0 b.i.d.) for 6 and then s.i.d. until discharge, potassium penicillin (Penicillin GPotassium 5, 22,000 i.v. s.i.d.) until discharge. The was discharged on Day 15 with instructions tocontinue enrofloxacin and flunixin meglumine and to have theurinary catheter changed every 2 days. Follow-up and outcome The horse re-presented for recheck cystoscopic examination21 days post foaling. The urinary catheter was removed at thistime and the mare observed to urinate normally. The bladderwas insufflated with air under endoscopic guidance and wasnoted to maintain distention. The edges of the tear hadhealed, although the centre of the tear was not able to becompletely evaluated due to the presence of a small amountof necrotic material and associated calculus accumulation.Haematology and serum chemistry were within normal limits.Culture of the urine or urinary catheter was not performed.The mare was discharged with instructions to continueenrofloxacin for 5 further days. No long-term complicationsassociated with the conservative treatment of cystorrhexiswere recorded and the mare has not been rebred. Case 2 A 10-year-old Thoroughbred mare 4 days post partum was admitted for signs of colic. Parturition had been observed andwas noted to be uneventful. On presentation, the mare wasmoderately uncomfortable, had a distended abdomen andwas tachycardic (84 beats/min). Abdominal ultrasonographyrevealed the biochemistry abdominocentesis performed.Abnormalities were 1078.5 and 1502.8 /uni00b5mol/l, respectively and serum and urea urinary tractrupture cystoscopic examination was performed andrevealed a tear in the left ventral bladder wall at the level ofthe ureteric ostia ( Fig 1 ). Treatment Urinary and abdominal drains were placed similar to Case 1 . Abdominal lavage was performed through the abdominaldrain using 10 l of Normosol-R 3with 300 ml of 50% dextrose twice daily for 4 days. After each instillation, the drain wasoccluded for 2 h before allowing the fluid to drain. The urinarycatheter was changed every 2 days and the abdominal drainremoved on Day 4 when the lavage was no longerproductive. Serum biochemistry was monitored daily and byDay 4, all values were within normal limits with serum creatinineand BUN 70.7 and 2.5 mmol/l, respectively. on i.v. (15 mg/kg bwt per os t.i.d.) for 5 days. On Day 7 the mare was started on trimethoprim sulfadiazine10(30 mg/kg bwt per os b.i.d.) and discharged on Day 10 with instructions to continueantibiotics and maintain the urinary catheter for one week untilre-examination. Follow-up and outcome The urinary catheter became dislodged 5 days after dischargeand was replaced by the referring veterinarian. Atre-examination, one week after discharge, the referringveterinarian removed the urinary catheter and the mare wasobserved to urinate normally. Follow-up cystoscopy was notperformed. One year after discharge the mare was healthywith no reported complications associated with the urinarytract. She had yet to be bred at the time of writing this report. Case 3 A yearling Thoroughbred colt was admitted for signs of colic ofapproximately 8 h duration. On presentation, the horse wastachycardic (64 beats/min) and not performed and due to pain unresponsive to medicaltherapy, it was elected to perform an emergency exploratory Fig 1: Cystoscopic image of the tear (white arrows) in the ventrocaudal bladder wall at the level of the ureteric in Case EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016celiotomy shortly after arrival at the hospital. When the horse was anaesthetised, a urethral calculus was found in theurethral process which was manually removed. A urinarycatheter was placed to ensure that no further urethral calculiwere present. A large amount of urine was encountered uponentering the abdomen and a tear in the bladder wasconfirmed by palpation, although its exact location was notrecorded. The abdomen was thoroughly lavaged using 15 l ofwarmed 0.9% sodium chloride and a 32F abdominal drain 2 placed. No attempt was made to repair the bladder at thetime of surgery and cystoscopy was not performed. Treatment The urinary catheter and abdominal drain were maintained asdescribed in Case 1 . The abdomen was lavaged twice daily for 4 days usin g 5 l Normosol-R 3and allowed to continually drain. The abdominal drain was removed on Day 4 due to apoor return of abdominal lavage fluid. Serum biochemistryand haematology were monitored throughout hospitalisationand were within normal limits by Day 4. While hospitalised, thehorse was maintained on i.v. fluids (Normosol-R 310 i.v. t.i.d.) for 5 days. On Day 13, antibiotic therapy was changed to trimethoprim sulfadiazine10 (30 mg/kg bwt bwt per os t.i.d.). Antibiotic therapy was prolonged due to a suspicion of peritonitis, as the colt became febrilewith an accompanying inflammatory leucogram duringhospitalisation. The urinary catheter was removed on Day 15and normal urination was observed on Day 16 and thereafter.Antibiotic therapy was discontinued on Day 19 and the horsedischarged. Follow-up and outcome The horse was readmitted 19 days following discharge for mildsigns of colic of undetermined aetiology, which resolved withmedical therapy. No abnormalities of the urinary tract werenoted at this visit. The horse had 4 subsequent successfulracing starts as a 3-year-old. Case 4 A 9-year-old Thoroughbred mare 3 days post partum presented for signs of depression and dehydration. Onpresentation, the mare was tachycardic (84 beats/min), rectalpalpation revealed a fluid-filled abdomen and abdominalultrasound confirmed the presence of excess PFF. Pale strawyellow coloured peritoneal fluid was obtained followingabdominocentesis and evaluation of this fluid revealed aBUN of 57.1 mmol/l and creatinine performedand a ventral tear towards the neck of the bladder with afibrinonecrotic border observed ( Fig 2 ). Treatment Surgical repair of the bladder defect was attempted byeverting the bladder transurethrally. Adequate exposure ofthe defect was not achieved and conservative managementwas elected. Abdominal and urinary catheters were placedand maintained as described in Case 1. The abdomen was lavaged twice daily for 3 days via the ventral abdominal drainusing 10 l 0.9% saline 8and was occluded for 2 h before draining. The urinary catheter was changed every 3 days. Themare was treated with i.v. 0.9% saline 8with added dextrose calcium t.i.d) on Day 1. Serumhaematology and biochemistry values returned to within thenormal range by Day 2 of hospitalisation and i.v. fluid therapywas changed to Normosol-R 3(10 l b.i.d.) for one additional received flunixin meglumine4(1.0 mg/kg bwt i.v. b.i.d.) for 5(22,000 bwt per os b.i.d.) beginning on Day 4. The mare was discharged on Day 7 with instructions tocontinue trimethoprim sulfadiazine and to change the urinarycatheter every 3 days. Follow-up and outcome The mare re-presented for recheck cystoscopy 16 days afterinitial presentation. The bladder was noted to hold urine andthe tear had completely healed. The urinary catheter wasremoved at this time and antibiotic therapy was discontinued.The mare was later sold at public auction and was lost tolong-term follow-up. Discussion Reported cases of conservative medical management ofcystorrhexis in horses are sparse, although successfulconservative management of bladder rents have previouslybeen documented in other domestic species. Conservativemanagement of equine bladder ruptures, with the use of anindwelling urinary catheter to allow second intention healing,potentially avoids reported complications and difficultiesexperienced with recumbent or standing surgical repair andmay be a viable option as demonstrated by 4 cases in thisseries. In cases of uroperitoneum, it has been recommended that urine be removed from the abdomen to assist in correcting Fig 2: Cystoscopic image of ventral bladder tear in Case 4 . \u00a92015 EVJ derangements (Schott and Woodie 2012) with the additional of decreasing chemical irritation tothe peritoneum (Genetzky and Hagemoser 1985). Abdominaldrainage and lavage was successfully performed via anabdominal drain placed under standing sedation in 3 horsesand under general anaesthesia in one. Occasional prolongeddrainage from the abdominal drain was experienced in all 4horses which was most likely due to blockage of the drainfenestrations with omentum or kinking of the drain under theweight of abdominal viscera. Prolonged drainage asexperienced with these cases has also been reported in postoperative colic cases (Hague et al . 1998); however , it did not preclude adequate drainage with time. Coupled withabdominal lavage, peritoneal dialysis was performed usingthe abdominal drain as an ingress and egress portal in Case 2 due to the high systemic presenting BUN and creatinine (37.1and 1078.5 /uni00b5mol, respectively). Peritoneal dialysis with a solution dextrose in a balanced electrolyte fluidcreates a hypertonic dialysate that has been shown to result inultrafiltration (Reuss et al . 2006). This allows for diffusion of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and other elevated electrolytes fromthe bloodstream into the peritoneal dialysate, which is thendrained. Intravenous fluids are also frequently necessary torapidly restore serum electrolytes to normal levels and wereused in all of our cases. Serum haematology and biochemistryshould be monitored frequently to evaluate hydration andelectrolyte status to appropriately adjust the rate and type ofintravenous fluids, particularly when peritoneal dialysis is alsoperformed (Reuss et al . 2006). Peritoneal lavage was performed in all cases, and without a control population tomake direct comparisons, the benefit of lavage and/orperitoneal dialysis cannot be determined. The continuousdrainage of urine from the abdomen is an important aspect ofmedical management of uroperitoneum and conclusionscannot be made whether the lavage improved outcome. Urinary catheters were placed in these patients to continually drain urine to decrease tension on the bladder walland reduce the amount of urine accumulating within theabdomen. Urinary catheters should be placed using strictaseptic technique and a closed or semi-closed system shouldbe used. This can be accomplished either with the use of aHeimlich valve or condom with the end removed. In these 4cases, a semi-closed system using a condom with the endremoved allowed continual drainage of urine. This is arelatively inexpensive system and was uncomplicated in thesecases. A closed system is used to decrease the risk of anascending urinary tract infection or peritonitis and to preventpneumoperitoneum (Schott and Woodie 2012). Cathetersshould be changed often (approximately every 3 days) andprophylactic antibiotics used to limit the risk of ascendinginfection. With proper client education and assistance fromthe referring veterinarian we have found that these catheterscan be maintained on the farm, which can greatly reduce theduration of hospitalisation and hence expense borne by theclient. The time for the equine bladder wall to completely heal by second intention is unknown. The shortest duration a urinarycatheter was maintained in our series was 15 days in Case 3 . Recheck cystoscopy was not performed to confirm the defecthad healed and in future cases, sequential cystoscopicexaminations would be helpful to better determine the time ittakes for bladder wall defects to heal. This knowledge couldpotentially reduce the time urinary catheters need to bemaintained in place and hence the duration of antibiotic therapy and cost. There are reports in the literature ofmedically managing bladder tears in man, although these arelimited to few reports with small sample sizes (Richardson andLeadbetter 1975; Robards et Gonzalea (2004) reported the mean timefor maintenance of urinary catheters was 15 days, althoughthere was no differentiation made between those managedmedically vs. surgically. All 3 mares in this study were notsubsequently bred and it is not known how long after healinghas occurred it is safe to do so. Also, it is not known if thelocation of the tear in the bladder wall determines its ability toheal using conservative treatment. Cases 1 ,2and 4had tears located close to the trigone which would have been difficultto access and repair using previously reported surgicaltechniques. Surgical repair was attempted in Case 4 ; however , adequate exposure was not possible due to the caudallocation of the tear. It is plausible that such tears would healmore quickly than those located at the apex of the bladderwhich is under the constant force of collecting urine. The tearsinCases 1, 2 and 4were located in the ventral bladder wall, in contrast to the typical dorsally located tears in foals. Suture material exposed to the bladder lumen serves as a nidus for calculus formation (Stephen et al . 2009; Schott and Woodie 2012) and it can be difficult to avoid penetrating thelumen particularly without adequate exteriorisation andvisualisation of the surgery site when utilising previouslyreported techniques. Recheck cystoscopy was onlyperformed in 2 horses. In Case 4 , the tear was noted to be completely healed without any abnormality in the bladderwall 16 days following diagnosis. Unfortunately, this horse waslost to long-term follow-up. In Case 1 , a small amount of necrotic tissue was visible at the healing site with calculusaccumulation. This necrotic tissue could, like exposed suturematerial, act as a nidus and promote calculus formation.However , to our knowledge, none of the horses in this seriesdeveloped any future complications associated with urolithformation. More cases with cystoscopic rechecks are neededto determine if this is a potential complication. Conservativetreatment leaves a bladder defect that has a raw surfaceexposed to abdominal viscera which may promote adhesionformation. No such adverse events associated with abdominaladhesions were encountered during the follow-up period,which ranged from one to 16 months. We experienced only one relatively minor complication in our series. Five days following discharge, Case 2 dislodged her urinary catheter which was easily replaced by a veterinarianat the farm. We did note that when indwelling urinarycatheters were finally removed, moderate amounts ofcrystalline concretions were observed around the catheter tipdespite frequent flushing and this may eventually have led tocatheter blockage. We therefore recommend that owners aregiven explicit discharge instructions in relation to catheter careand monitoring. Ascending infection in the presence ofabdominal and indwelling urinary catheters has been areported concern (Schott and Woodie 2012) but we did notobserve this complication. However , urinalysis or abdominalfluid cultures were not performed to substantiate this claimand all horses were maintained on prophylactic antibiotictherapy. Hospitalisation and antibiotic therapy was prolonged for Cases 1 and 3due to complications likely not associated with the bladder tear itself. Case 1 was treated for endometritis and \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd634 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016\"I recommend ColiCare for all of my patients, and my own horses are enrolled, too!\" \u2014Marsha Severt, DVM Brown Creek Equine Hospital ColiCare puts you back at the center of the horse's wellness care and provides up to $7,500 of reimbursement to help ease the nancial burden of colic surgery.

Case 3 was treated for a suspected peritonitis that was likely associated with abdominal exploratory surgery. Summarily, conservative medical management of traumatic adult equine bladder ruptures was successful in the4 cases in our series. However , further controlled studies areneeded to determine the validity of this treatment methodand establish the expected healing time and any associatedpotential complications in a larger number of horses before itmay be advocated as an accepted treatment.

Coomer*, Hospital, Robeston Wathen, Narberth, Pembrokeshire;School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol, North Somerset, UK;\u00a7M\u20acalaren Equine Clinic, Sigtuna, Sweden; Summary Diagnostic laparotomy and laparoscopy are surgical techniques commonly used for the investigation of chronic abdominal disease and weight loss. They can both be usefully carried out in the standing sedated horse, allowing athorough examination of the dorsal abdominal cavity and biopsies to be harvested. Small intestinal disease is an important cause of weight loss and recurrent colic. Inflammatory or neoplastic bowel disease may not always be apparent grossly and histopathological assessment of full thickness biopsies may be required to provide a de nitive diagnosis. Details of cases of 15 horses that underwent small intestinal biopsy or enterectomy while sedated and standing are presented. Three incisional infections occurred causing delayed wound healing. Three horses were subjected to euthanasia before hospital discharge: two had persistent gastric re flux and one had colitis. A further six were subjected to euthanasia in the rst 4 months due to their underlying inflammatory bowel condition. One horse was subjected to euthanasia for severe laminitis that was presumed to be caused by treatment with a corticosteroid 4 years later, and one died of acute colic 2.3 years after successful resection and anastomosis. Five horses were alive at the time of review, median 2.7, range 1.2 -4.3 years. Overall therefore, 3 (20%) horses died during hospitalisation and 5 (33%) were still alive at the end of the study. Results from this series suggest that minimising the number of intestinal biopsies may reduce morbidity, but the underlying pathological process appears to be the most important prognostic factor for survival. Resection and anastomosis in the standing sedated horse proved feasible. Background Chronic weight loss and recurrent colic are commonlyencountered signs of abdominal disease (Mair 2002; Mair and Divers 2008). Diagnostic investigations can be complex and obtaining a de nitive diagnosis in some cases requires surgical abdominal exploration, either by laparotomy or laparoscopy (Ragle 2002; Klohnen 2012). Diagnostic laparoscopy in the standing horse has become increasingly popular as it combines all of the advantages of minimally invasive surgery and provides a unique view of the dorsal portion of the abdominal cavity (Ragle 2002). However, it is a specialist procedure with relatively poor speci city (Walmsley 1999). Although the diagnostic information obtained may be invaluable, owners can be wary of the procedure because of the dif culty in treating any problems identi ed using laparoscopic instrumentation.Whether or not gross abnormalities are noted, obtaining intestinal biopsy samples for subsequent histopathology can allow an otherwise elusive diagnosis to be made. Prognosis can then be offered and a treatment plan formulated (Mair 2002; Trachsel et al. 2010). The aim of this study was to review the technique, complications and outcome of a small series of horses that underwent extra-abdominal small intestinal surgery under standing sedation, involving either the harvesting of full-thickness intestinal biopsies, or resection and anastomosis. Methods Horses were starved for 36 h prior to surgery, where possible.They were restrained and sedated in stocks using a bolus i.v. dose mg/kg bwt) and butorphanol mg/kg bwt), followed by further incremental doses of detomidine supplied either as a repeat bolus, or as a constant rate infusion (20 lg/kg mg/kg bwt) were administered 60 min prior to performing a skin incision. In seven horses only the left paralumbar fossa was prepared for standing laparotomy; in a further eight horses both paralumbar fossae were clipped and prepared for aseptic laparoscopic surgery. Skin and muscle layers wereanaesthetised by in ltration of mepivicaine hydrochloride at the proposed incision sites (15 ml of 2% solution per site) after aseptic skin preparation. Procedures were performed by one of three surgeons. One surgeon performed seven unilateral left-sided laparotomies with a random section of small intestine selected after palpation. Laparotomy was carried out by means of a standard 7 -12 cm long gridiron incision (Hendrickson 2007; Graham and Freeman 2014). In the eight bilateral surgical procedures, routine diagnostic laparoscopy was rst performed on both sides, with one side prepared for laparotomy; two surgeons used the left side in four horses and one surgeon used the right side in four horses. A single portal was placed in the left paralumbar fossa level with the ventral tuber coxa . The rst instrument port was orientated vertically below the scope portal; the third placed in the 17th intercostal space. One surgeon used these two instrument ports to 'walk 'the entire length of the small intestine using atraumatic laparoscopic bowel grasping forceps 1in one horse. To nd the proximal end of the jejunum, the ascending duodenum was traced from its medial attachment to the caecum. After a brief assessment in seven horses, two surgeons linked the paralumbar ports to create a grid laparotomy incision and then subsequently used a hand- \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd636 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016assisted technique to examine the whole length of the small intestine. The section of intestine for biopsy was selected and manipulated using instrumentation, or by hand, before being exteriorised via the laparotomy wound ( Fig 1 ). Having exteriorised the small ( 2 ), a routine antimesenteric full-thickness biopsy (approximately 8920 mm) was obtained using conventional instrumentation. The resultant defect was repaired using a continuous single layer Cushing inverting suture pattern using poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl)3. After lavage, the intestine was replaced and further biopsies were obtained in the same manner, as required. No local anaesthetic was applied to the intestine before biopsy or resection. Intestinal resection was carried out via the same laparotomy technique. The portion of intestine to be resected was exteriorised and supported by an assistant surgeon (Fig 3 ). Following resection, a standard two-layer hand sewn end-to-end anastomosis ( Fig 4 ) was performed (McIlwraith and Robertson 1998), using a simple continuous suture to oppose the mucosa2. Short-term complications were de ned as those occurring as a direct result of the surgical intervention. Long-term follow-up was obtained by re-examination and telephone interview with the owner. Data were collated and descriptive statistics calculated using a standard spreadsheet (Excel)4. Results Fifteen horses underwent surgery in the period 2005 -2014: six mares and nine geldings aged 6 -25 years, mean and median 15 years. There were seven Thoroughbreds or crosses, three Warmbloods, three ponies and two cobs. Twelve horses were presented for weight loss, one for pyrexia of unknown origin, one for recurrent colic and one for acute colic. Seven horses underwent unilateral left flank laparotomy without a preceding laparoscopic evaluation. Eight horses underwent initial diagnostic laparoscopy; the subsequent laparotomy was carried out in the left flank (four cases) and right flank (four cases). The median number of biopsies taken was three, range 1 -4. The diagnosis in 13 of the horses was inflammatory bowel disease, including the horse with pyrexia of unknown origin: nine were classi ed as lymphoplasmacytic and four as eosinophilic enteritis. Amongst the eight horses undergoing laparoscopy, the visual appearance of biopsied sections of bowel appeared abnormal in four horses (thickened/reddened bowel wall) and normal in four. A single biopsy was harvested in each of the four horses with grossly abnormal intestine; the four horses with normal-appearing intestine had one, two, three and three biopsies harvested, with choice governed by the surgeon. The number of histologically normal or abnormal biopsy tissues harvestedwas not recorded. Small intestinal resection and end-to-end anastomosis were carried out under standing sedation in two horses.

In one horse with acute colic, resection was undertaken for purely nancial reasons as a 'last resort '. The horse had been showing evidence of colic for 36 h and was clinically demonstrating signs of systemic in flammatory response syndrome (heart rate 80 beats/min, mucous membranes congested, capillary re ll time 3 s, packed cell volume 58%). One metre of jejunum was resected after strangulation by a pedunculated lipoma. In the other case of intestinal resection, the horse had advanced paraneoplastic syndrome with profound weight loss, thus making it an unsuitable candidate for general anaesthesia ( Fig 5 ). A grossly abnormal, 20 cm section of small intestine was found and removed during the standing abdominal surgery.Histopathology demonstrated a highly in ltrative adenocarcinoma, with in ltration of local lymphatics within the submucosa and serosa. Hospital mortality and morbidity Three horses underwent euthanasia before hospital dischargeas a result of persistent post operative gastric re flux in two horses and colitis in a third. The horse that underwent intestinal resection for a strangulating lipoma experienced severe gastric re flux until it was subjected to euthanasia. The other horse with post operative re flux underwent an elective left flank blind laparotomy and collection of 4 small intestinal biopsies: three jejunal and one ileal. The diagnosis was eosinophilic enteritis. After re fluxing for 3 days it had undergone exploratory laparotomy under general anaesthesia, where paralytic ileus was the only nding; the biopsy sites all appeared healthy. Re flux continued after this surgery, necessitating euthanasia after a further 3 days. No other horses developed gastric re flux. One horse developed acute colitis and severe diarrhoea. This horse was subjected to euthanasia on Day 10 after the condition deteriorated despite intensive treatment. Of the 11 horses that survived to hospital discharge, three developed wound infections with partial dehiscence during the hospitalisation period. All three had undergone blind laparotomy without laparoscopy. They were successfullymanaged by wound drainage and parenteral antibiotics, with individual drug choice varying due to differences in culture and sensitivity results. The number of biopsies in the horses suffering wound complications was four, four and three; no horses undergoing one or two biopsies developed wound complications. Mortality and morbidity after hospital discharge Of the 12 horses discharged, ve underwent euthanasia within 4 months due to on-going in flammatory bowel disease, malabsorption and weight loss: four lymphoplasmacytic and one eosinophilic. One horse developed severe laminitis with distal displacement of the distal phalanges 4 years after surgery, with the cause considered to be a complication of oral prednisolone therapy for its in flammatory bowel disease (Johnson et al. 2002). The horse that underwent resection and anastomosis for adenocarcinoma gained weight afterdischarge; however, it developed acute severe colic 28 months later and was subjected to euthanasia. No post mortem examination was carried out. Five horses (33%) were still alive at the time of writing this paper, three with a diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic enteritis and two with a diagnosis of eosinophilic enteritis, with a median survival of 2.7 years, range 1.2 -4.3 years. Discussion Obtaining full-thickness small intestinal biopsies in standing sedated horses using the extra-abdominal technique described herein proved expedient from either flank, with or without laparoscopic assistance. Although elegant laparoscopic intra-abdominal intestinal biopsy techniques have been described (Schambourg and Marcoux 2006; Bracamonte et al. 2008), these procedures require the use of advanced laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing skills orexpensive biopsy via flank laparotomy has been alluded to in several reviews (Mair 2002; Graham and Freeman 2014), yet there are no published reports citing the use of these Fig 4: Routine hand sewn end-to-end anastomosis was carried out. Fig 5: One of the horses examined for weight loss was found tohave a focal jejunal adenocarcinoma during laparoscopy. It wastoo thin and weak to be safely anaesthetised and therefore underwent resection and anastomosis during the same standing procedure. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd638 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016techniques clinically. The extra-abdominal technique described herein is more secure in our experience, obviating the need for intracorporeal suturing and thereby negating the risk of peritoneal contamination. Intestinal resection and anastomosis was also carried out successfully by this method, in both cases because general anaesthesia was not possible for either nancial or clinical reasons. Laparoscopy appeared to facilitate a thorough examination of intestine by allowing visual examination of small intestine before performing flank laparotomy; however, tissue samples collected by flank laparotomy without a preceding laparoscopic examination were, in every case, diagnostic. This suggests that the difference between selecting abnormal small intestine by palpation or visualisation was not signi cant. However, laparoscopy allowed visually abnormal bowel to be selected in some horses, thereby reducing the number of diagnostic biopsies required. This would be anticipated to have direct positive effects on surgical time and morbidity. Surgery time was not quanti ed in this review, preventing more objective analysis on this point, yet no horses undergoing one or two biopsies suffered post operative complications. Laparoscopic examination also allows visual assessment of the dorsal portion of the abdomen and biopsy of abnormal masses/ mesenteric lymph nodes that may not be feasible by flank laparotomy. Incisional infections af flicted three horses and is widely recognised as a risk when performing flank laparotomy in horses. Graham and Freeman (2014) hypothesised that this is due to increased tissue trauma working in the tight space as the surgeon 's arm is repeatedly inserted and withdrawn. All three horses affected in this series had undergone blind laparotomy without laparoscopic assistance, thereby creating a potential source of increased incisional trauma through repeated abdominal entries during the selection process. The most common reported indication for equine standing flank laparotomy has been for ovariectomy, where reported rates of incisional infection vary. A selection of studies from the last 15 years report infections as a proportion of laparotomies: 1/43 (2%; De 2011); and (11%; Lloyd et al. 2007). Wound complications afflicted 3/15 horses (20%) in this series. One possible reason for the increased incisional healing problems was that most (13/15) horses in this series received systemic corticosteroid administration to treat the underlying in flammatory bowel condition in the early post operative period, including all three that developed infections. The small numbers in this case series prevented meaningful comparison, but no horses undergoing one or two biopsies developed incisional complications. This supports Graham and Freeman 's (2014) hypothesis that time combined with increased surgical trauma increases risk of infection. Gastric re flux due to post operative ileus occurred following standing abdominal surgery, af flicting two horses in this series. This was anticipated in the acute colic case because advanced systemic in flammatory response syndrome was already present and surgery was carried out in a'last resort 'scenario. Decompression of the distended bowel oral to the obstruction could not be performed. However, ileus also occurred in an elective laparotomy inone horse affected by weight loss. This horse had fourbiopsies taken, which would have affected both surgical trauma and time. However, the two other horses that had four biopsies taken suffered no complications. Overall, this source of morbidity seems most likely to be related to the underlying condition, as opposed to being caused by the surgical technique. Performing a standing approach for the purpose of small intestinal biopsy provides an additional diagnostic technique whereby small intestinal biopsies can be taken without the need for general anaesthesia or advanced laparoscopic skills and equipment. Indications for standing small intestinal resection and end-to-end anastomosis are rarely encountered; acute colic with intestinal distension has been suggested to be a contraindication for standing surgery (Graham and Freeman 2014), although some authors recommend standing laparoscopic assessment where pain and logistics permit (Klohnen 2012). This study con rms the inadvisability of this technique for acute strangulation, potentially due in large part to the practical impossibility of decompressing bowel oral to the obstruction. In one case in this series, standing intestinal resection and anastomosis proved successful, with surmountable dif culties when suturing a moving bowel, supporting the intestine and preventing exteriorisation of healthy adjacent bowel. Use of a Mayo instrument tray, appropriately draped and standing against the side of the horse, would have facilitated this part of the procedure by providing a small flat area to work on. Additional topical local anaesthesia was not needed forintestinal surgery in conscious sedated horses, despite the application of bowel clamps and sharp transection of bowel wall, as has been noted in man, e.g. Rogozov and Bemel (2009). This may be partly attributable to administration of appropriate pre- and perioperative analgesic drugs. In addition, there are no proprioceptors in viscera and few touch or temperature receptors; pain receptors are present at much lower density than in somatic structures (Ganong 2005). Although hollow viscera are known to be particularly sensitive to distension, sharp incisional trauma is less likely to elicit visceral pain. In conclusion, obtaining full-thickness small intestinal biopsies using an extra-abdominal technique was effective and safe. There was some indication that minimising the number of biopsies reduced morbidity, yet the underlying pathological process appeared to be the most important prognostic factor for survival. The small numbers of different types of in flammatory bowel disease made comparisons of survival meaningless. We found that performing intestinal resection and anastomosis on a standing horse may be feasible if the horse is tractable and adequately sedated; however, based on the experience of others (Graham and Freeman 2014) standing intestinal surgery in the horse is not without risk.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium is (dichloromethylene) salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of acci-dental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associ- ated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal im-pairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be mon-itored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some min- erals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and po-tassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skel-eton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphos-phonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lac-tating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the to-tal dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; how-ever, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary Products 866-933-2472 \u00a9 Dechra Ltd.

Lundstr \u20acom* and O. Wattle Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Department of Clinical Sciences, orthograde endodontic method, similar to that used in human dentistry, is described for use on endodontically diseased permanent cheek teeth in horses. The technique has been adapted to meet the anatomical and physiological differences between hypsodont and brachyodont teeth and is performed in sedated horses. The techniques of debriding the pulp cavity and use of dental materials which ful l the requirements for equine teeth are presented here. The results of this technique appear to be promising but have yet to be evaluated in a peer-reviewed study. By using orthograde endodontic therapy on sedated horses it is now possible to save endodontically diseased permanent cheek teeth. Introduction Horses have 6 cheek teeth (3 premolars and 3 molars) in each quadrant. For optimal masticatory function the 6 teeth in each quadrant need to be close together in a row at the occlusal level. The integrity is maintained by the caudal angulation of the Triadan Triadans 10 -11s. In equine dentistry, extraction has been the traditional treatment for apical infection of cheek teeth. Loss of a tooth decreases the occlusal surface area and may lead to a series of dental problems such as drifting of teeth and elongation of the opposite tooth. We suggest that the aim of equine dentistry should be to preserve all of the teeth within the dental arcades, i.e. maintain complete occlusion. Infections of the pulp tissue, periapical infections and possible associated sinus involvement are common equine dental diseases (Dixon et al. 2000). Endodontic disease is an inflammatory or necrotic process in the pulp. The onset of clinical signs can be acute but are most often due to exacerbation of a chronic endodontic disease. Localised pain, nasal discharge, facial swelling, formation of stulae and sinusitis are common clinical signs in horses suffering from endodontic disease. In man, intermittent pain while chewing, headache, sensitivity to heat, cold or percussion, irritability, diminished appetite and general malaise are common clinical signs of endodontic infection (Olgart and Bergenholtz 2010). Endodontic disease in both horses and man is most often associated with apical periodontitis. The World Health Organisation recognises 5 major categories of apical periodontitis in man: (1) apical (Anon 1995). We believe that this classi cation is also applicable in equine dentistry. Anachoresis, localisation of microbes from the bloodstream in a damaged pulp, is proposed to be the main cause of infection of pulp or periapical tissue of horses (Dacre et al. 2008a,b). In our experience, most cases of endodontic disease start with a defect in the hard tissue of the tooth, e.g. ssure/fracture, grade 3 caries lesion or aggressive floating with power tools, which creates a gateway for oral bacteria and consequently in flammation of the pulp. As long as the pulp remains vital, the tooth should respond to minor pathological stimuli, such as infection of oral bacteria through a small ssure. A vital tooth will respond by producing so called tertiary dentine which can seal off the vital apical aspects of the pulp from the more occlusally located areas of the insulted pulp (Dacre et al. 2007). If the vascular supply of the dental pulp is cut off, for example, as the result of a trauma, the dentine producing cells, odontoblasts, will die. Hence, no secondary or tertiary dentine is formed and the normal occlusal attrition will lead to exposure of pulp cavities. A diseased pulp can be in flamed and still have reversible changes. However, if the pulp disease is prolonged it will lead to necrosis and pulp gangrene (Sj \u20acogren et al. 1997). If a pulp infection remains untreated the result is that the periapicalbone becomes affected, which in turn might result in the clinical signs previously described. The majority of apical periodontitis develop as a result of an endodontic disease, but in some cases a diseased periodontium creates the entrance gate for an infection in the periapical area (Fig 1 ). In human dentistry, for more than 100 years, endodontic and periapical disease have been treated by debriding the M2 M3 Fig 1: Radiograph of maxillary teeth 09 -11 of a 22-year-old Haflinger with sinusitis due to a periapical infection at 210 caused by a diastema and disrupted periodontal ligament between 210 -211.[The copyright line for this article was changed on 7 July 2016 after original online publication] \u00a92016 The Authors.

The success of treatment can vary, for many reasons, but endodontics is still one of the most common treatments in human dentistry. In parallel with improved dental diagnostics, the techniques and tools available for endodontics have also improved. The use of ISO E-type hand-pieces, with extension handles, permits the use of dental burs on all teeth, which in turn permits remedial work on de ned parts of a tooth 's outer surface and on the pulp and pulp cavity. With endodontic treatment, it is possible to limit pulp damage, eliminate pulp infection and complications of pulp damage and re-establish the barrier function. This means it is potentially possible to preserve an equine cheek tooth (CT) that has had pulp or apical infection. In small animal dentistry, orthograde endodontic treatment has been carried out for many decades and good results have been reported (Clarke 2001; Kuntsi-Vaattovaara et al. 2002; Silveira et al. 2007; Menzies et al. 2014). The rst published equine study on this topic, that included follow-ups, comprised apicoectomy and retrogradeendodontic treatment for apical CT infection in 12 horses(Simhofer et al. 2008). However, the poor long-term results of the study raised doubts as to whether this type of endodontic treatment was a feasible treatment (Simhofer et al. 2008). In our experience, the biological differences in dentition between a herbivore and brachyodont, the prolonged eruption of hypsodont teeth, the presence of all 3 dental hard tissues on the occlusal surface and the anatomy of the equine head make the endodontic techniques used for man less suitable for equine CT. With this in mind, about 15 years ago we started to develop a technique for endodontic treatment of equine CT that was safe enough to be performed in a standardised manner on a standing horse and achieved acceptable long-term success. It is of course challenging to clean out the pulp cavity of a hypsodont CT, which is why good knowledge of anatomy is important. Moreover, despite differences in anatomy, our preliminary ndings suggest that good results can be achieved using orthograde techniques on hypsodont teeth (Wattle 2011; Lundstr \u20acom 2012). The endodontic techniques were initially developed in brachyodont dentition but since horses have hypsodont teeth Buccal M1M22 IC IC 4 36a) b) c) d)5*** 1 C Fig 2: Comparison of a maxillary hypsodont tooth of a 7-year-old Warmblood (a and b) and a brachyodont tooth of a 7-year-old German Shepherd (c and d) (rostral to the left and caudal to the right). a) Maxillary 09 with the gingival margin illustrated with a redline.

Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. on behalf of EVJ Ltd642 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016it is important to understand some differences between these types of teeth. A brachyodont permanent tooth has a developed root from Day 1 after eruption and its clinical crown is similar to the anatomical crown. When a hypsodont tooth erupts it has no true root, i.e. the apical area contains enamel. Thus, before root development starts, the anatomical crown stretches from the clinical crown to the apex, i.e. the clinical crown is not the same as the anatomical crown. The formation of roots starts after the tooth is in occlusion with its counterpart and the normal wear process of attrition has started ( Fig 2 ). All dental hard tissues, i.e. cementum, dentine and enamel are exposed on the hypsodont tooth occlusal surface compared with just enamel on a brachyodont tooth (Fig 2 ). In the hypsodont tooth, the appearance of the occlusal surface can vary with attrition. Furthermore, the distance between the occlusal surface and underlying pulp cavities can vary between teeth, within a tooth and depending on age ( Figs 3 and 4). When opening the occlusal surface with a dental burr, with the aim of nding the pulp cavity and facilitating the insertion of endodontic les, it is also important to consider the shape and angulation of the CT as illustrated inFigure 4 . The pulp is connected with the periodontal membranes, at the apex, in both brachyodont and hypsodont teeth. A brachyodont cheek tooth has a pulp chamber in the crown Fig 3: Computed tomography transverse section of a 4-year-old Warmblood at the 07 level with red brackets illustrating thedistance between the occlusal surface and pulp tissue. The thickness of subocclusal secondary dentine, i.e. the distance between the occlusal surface and pulp tissue is reported to varybetween 5 and 33 mm in cheek teeth of a 4-year-old andbetween 2 and 24 mm in a 16-year-old horse (White and Dixon2010). The thickness of secondary dentine does not increase inovergrown equine cheek teeth (Marshall et al. 2012). In a tooth that has been in occlusion for less than one year, subocclusalsecondary dentine is normally >2 cm thick. a) b)c) Radiographs of maxillary CT (a) and mandibular CT (b) of the angulation of the rostral and caudal CT that support the tight apposition at the occlusal surface. c) section of 4 year-old Warmblood at the07s level.

This fact makes it more dif cult to access the pulp cavity in an older tooth with endodontic les. Removal of damaged pulp tissue and any contained feedstuff is facilitated by the fact that attrition makes the tooth shorter and root development and age result in the pulp horns being totally separated, as well as being reduced in size. Equine CT normally have 5 -7 pulp horns that meet in 2 roots for mandibular CT or in 3 -4 roots for maxillary CT ( Figs 2 ,6,8and 9). Diagnosis of endodontic disease Diagnosis of a diseased pulp and/or periapical region is determined by clinical signs and oral ndings, usually with complementary radiographs. Oral ndings indicating endodontic disease are fractures of teeth, caries lesions and occlusal pulpar exposure, sometimes including pulp chambers lled with food. In many cases it is possible to evaluate the severity of pulp damage just by using a dentalprobe and mirror. In less obvious cases an intraoral camera can be of great use to accurately examine and recordimages of the clinical crown. In some cases, computed tomography and scintigraphy may be of use to determine the extent of the problem and obtain conclusive evidence of whether endodontic disease exists. The clinical signs of apical cheek teeth infection show great variation, from no obvious signs, to severe acute signs with swelling of bone/soft tissue and discharge from the nostrils or draining tracts. In some cases, the clinical crown can be perfectly normal despite obvious extraoral ndings, such as swellings over the apical area and abnormal radiographic ndings. Such a clinical picture suggests that endodontic disease can be caused by anachoresis (Dacre et al. 2008a,b). Without doubt, compromised pulpar blood supply can cause diminished or lack of deposition of secondary dentine, which in turn leads to microscopic pulp exposures. Local trauma or other sources of in flammation in the apex area are potential primary causes of reduced blood supply to the pulp tissue. Radiography is an important diagnostic aid. Several different projections are usually needed to minimise the risk of misinterpretation of radiographic ndings. Findings indicating endodontic disease are loss of lamina dura, lysis of periapical bone and formation of a sclerotic zone (Menzies et al. 2012). It can be dif cult to decide whether one should open pulps that are not occlusally exposed, especially when radiographs only show the rostral or caudal aspects of the tooth to be affected. In a young horse, there may be communication between all pulps (Windley et al. 2009; Kopke et al. 2012) which is why the process can involve the whole pulp cavity, even if only a single pulp horn is exposed. In older horses, over 9 -10 years of age, the pulp horns are separated and certain parts of the tooth can be vital while other parts are necrotic and gangrenous. In such cases it can be anadvantage to leave the vital part of the tooth untouched and just open up the affected segment ( Fig 10 ). When endodontic disease is limited to the 2 rostral or 2 caudal pulps it is wise, besides opening these pulp cavities, to a) b) Fig 7: a) Transverse section 1 cm beneath the gingival margin of a mandibular 08 in a 4-year-old Standarbred, showing relatively wide pulp canals. b) Transverse section 1 cm beneath thegingival margin of a maxillary 08 in a 15-year-old Standarbred.

This is because they will communicate with the rostral or the caudal parts of the tooth (Windley et al. 2009; Kopke et al. 2012). If a healthy/vital pulp is opened up it is essential to perform vital pulp therapy with partial pulpotomy and restoration. In fortunate cases, an exposed vital pulp can be saved by vital pulp therapy (pulp capping). Capping begins by excavating the exposed area, cleaning the cavity and securing haemostasis. The pulp is then covered with a sterile barrier material, or dentine shavings and sealed with a dental material, most often a resin-based composite or cement. However, in our experience, CT suitable for capping are very rare in equine dentistry and are not discussed further here. The orthograde technique Orthograde access to the pulp cavity means that the access point is the occlusal surface. The use of this technique implies that there is no bacterial leakage from the oral cavity to the apical region through a diseased periodontium ( Figs 1 and 11). We also refrain from treating teeth with severe loss of dental substance. To evaluate the endodontic method wehave used since 2006, we followed up 474 horses treated in our clinical practices. The orthograde technique starts with creating an access to the pulp cavity. A round-shaped, slow-speed burr is placed on the occlusal surface of the secondary dentine ( Fig 12 ) and with light pressure and continuous movement of the burr, bearing the anatomy of the tooth in mind, the pulp cavity is penetrated. It is easy and safe to create a pulp opening with the burr and then check the position of this point with a dental mirror. On continuing drilling, a change in resistance can be detected if the burr leaves the track of secondary dentine, i.e. it feels more resistant and the burr proceeds more slowly into the dental tissue. The walls of the access cavity are then flared/widened with a Lindeman- burr ( Fig 13 ) to make it easier to nd and access the pulp cavity with the endodontic les used to clean out diseased tissue and feedstuff. The les are manoeuvred either maxillary 06 -08. The periapically infected 07 has had a blunt needle inserted in its periodontium,showing the presence of a periodontal-endodontic lesion. a) b) Fig 12: a) Triadan 408 as seen from the buccal side. b) Opening of a pulp cavity with a round-shaped carbine burr.

It is important to direct the les in line with the pulp cavity and see whether the points can be slowly pushed further into the cavity. If this cannot be done, one has to redirect the le or burr further into the secondary dentine because just pushing harder will result in a bent le. We use Hedstr \u20acom les, designed for a push and pull motion, with lengths from 28 -140 mm and sizes ranging from 15-80 on the ISO system scale ( Fig 14 ). We start with short and thin les and progress step by step to longer andthicker les. The les are moved up and down within the pulp cavity with a twisting movement if held by hand. The abrasive surface of the le will work on the walls of the cavity. The pulp cavity is repeatedly irrigated with sterile saline during the debridement, to soften the material within the cavity and remove debris. In general, only the smaller sized les can be used for the most apical aspect of the root in adult horses. Radiographs should be used during preparation to decidewhether one has been able or unable to clean the full length of the tooth ( Fig 15 ). A motorised pump is used to effectively irrigate the pulp canals with a large volume of saline, i.e. 500 -2000 ml ( Fig 16 ). If there is dif culty in removing all necrotic pulp tissue with the endodontic les, rinsing the canal with an antiseptic solution of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (Dakin 's solution) 1can be helpful. A volume suf cient to ll the pulp cavity is required and the solution is left in place for a few minutes. If possible, suction is used to remove Dakin 's solution and the pulp cavity subsequently irrigated thoroughly with sterile saline. There have been reports of severe reaction when sodium hypochlorite has come into contact with soft tissue (H \u20aculsmann and Hahn 2000; Spencer et al. 2007). However, the sodium hypochlorite concentration exceeded 0.5% in nearly all reported cases. It is reasonable to believe that some Dakin 's solution has ended up in the a) b) Fig 14: Hedstrom les held in forceps being inserted into a Triadan 408 pulp canal. a) Size 40, length 28 mm. b) Size 40,length 95 mm.

After using Dakin 's solution, we rinse the oral cavity with tap water. If there is bleeding, for instance from accidently hitting a vital periapical area with a le, asupersaturated solution of Ca(OH) 2(lime water)1, may be used for haemostasis since calcium ions enhance coagulation. Occasionally, a complex binder, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), can be helpful in dissolving debris in the canals, especially when there is severe calci cation. After preparation, the cavity is washed thoroughly with sterile saline and excess fluid then removed using suction, air drying and blotting dry with cotton pellets or paper points after which the preparation is thoroughly inspected using a dental mirror or intraoral camera ( Fig 17 ). To obtain a proper seal the exposed dentine walls must be as dry as possible. If needed, an endodontic le with a cotton pellet twined around it can be used to dry the deeper part of the cavity. The pulp cavity/cavities are then lled and sealed off. The anatomy of a hypsodont CT is complex and we use calcium hydroxide (Thomas et al. 2012) in the form of Calasept plus2 emulsion to ll the major parts of the canals. Calcium hydroxide is a strongly alkaline (pH approximately 12) Fig 17: Post preparation, intraoral photograph of a clean and dry pulp horn access cavity. a) b) Fig 18: Photograph of Triadan 406. a) Calcium hydroxide being injected into the pulp cavity with a syringe and a flexible needle. b) The calcium hydroxide being further distributed within the pulpcavity using a lentulo-spiral ller. a) b) Fig 19: Intraoral photographs of mandibular 06s. a) Using an excavator, Provicol is removed from the occlusal 5 mm of thetreated pulp horn. b) Self-etching dental adhesive is then appliedto this site with a small brush. \u00a92016 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. on behalf of EVJ Ltd649 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016emulsion which initially causes a chemical injury to the vital soft tissue and thereby a zone of rm necrosis adjacent to vital tissue and because of its pH and liquid content, calcium hydroxide also contributes by dissolving nonvital pulp remnants and feedstuff. Calasept plus2is applied with a cannula and distributed within the pulp cavity with the aim of lining the canal walls by use of a dental paste ller, i.e. a lentulo-spiral ller ( Fig 18 ). It is crucial to condense the calcium hydroxide lining the canal walls in order to minimisethe liquid part (water). Therefore, as much excess calciumhydroxide as possible is removed with cotton pellets or paperpoints while the remaining calcium hydroxide is compressedto a thin layer lining the walls of the pulp cavity. The occlusal seal or 'lling'in restored teeth is about 15 - 20 mm in thickness and should always consist of 2 outer layersof different dental lling materials, i.e. the bulk lling and occlusal seal. For reasons of safety, the 2 lling materials must not be chemically bonded to each other. If the occlusal layer crumbles there is still the bulk material layer to prevent bacteria from reaching the apex. In cases where a renewed endodontic treatment is planned shortly afterwards (e.g. amonth or so), a eugenol-free periodontal dressing (Coe-Pak regular set) 3can be used as an outer layer, in order to make reopening of the pulp cavity easier. However, Coe-Pak has a low mechanical resistance and for a long-lasting seal it is preferable to use resin-based materials which can be bonded to dentine with a micromechanical bond. For a long-lasting seal, which is about 2 years in a tooth that is in occlusion, the bulk of the cavity is lled with a zinc oxide eugenol-free cement containing calcium hydroxide (Provicol QM).4The cement is pressed into the cavity with a condenser. Provicol QM4has an advantage in that it does not bind chemically to the dentine. If one uses a bulk material that binds to dentine and contracts with time the dental hard tissues will be stressed. The material used for an occlusal seal in a CT should wear down at the same rate as dentine, or be kept out of occlusion. Using an excavator, the cement is removed from approximately the outer 5 mm ofthe cavity. A one component self-etching dental adhesive (Xeno V) 4, is then applied with a small brush ( Fig 19 ). Excess etching substance is evaporated with a moderate stream of air. The area is then light-cured for about 10 s. a) b)c) d) Fig 20: Extraoral radiographs of maxillary teeth before treatment (a and c) and the same teeth years after clinically successful treatments (b and d). a) Triadan 106 during preparation of the pulp cavity. b) The same tooth 3 years after treatment showing a more homogenous appearance of the periapical bone, i.e. no radiolucency. c) Triadan 107 before treatment. d) Same tooth 2 years post treatment. \u00a92016 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. on behalf of EVJ Ltd650 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2016As an occlusal seal we use a ~5 mm thick coat of resin cement (Embrace WetBond medium viscosity)4, a both self- curing and light-cured product that can be ground down by the enamel of the opposite tooth. Even if this is the goal, it is not always possible to debride the root canal of a CT completely in one attempt. Therefore, after 3 -8 weeks, the mechanical and chemical pulp cavity preparation should be repeated. Once the pulp cavity/ cavities are clean and dry, the pulp is sealed off again as previously described. If clinical signs have disappeared at this point follow-up examination is scheduled for 6 months and then 6 months later. One year after the rst treatment, radiographs are taken to assess whether the periapical bone is or is not recovering (Fig 20 ). If both clinical and radiographic ndings are satisfactory, further follow-ups are scheduled annually. Evaluation of clinical signs includes the examination of adjacent soft tissues, closing of stulas, eruption of affected teeth and the presence of nasal discharge in cases that have had sinusitis. General health and performance are also included in the evaluation. Clinical experience of the orthograde endodontic technique Over the years we have treated over 700 cheek teeth endodontically. The long-term (3 -6 years, median 5 years) result of the treatment have been accessed for 474 of these teeth and some 80% assessed as having a successful outcome (Lundstr \u20acom 2012). This outcome is similar to that reported at follow-ups of endodontic therapy in man(Bernstein et al. 2012). Remaining stulas, including those that caused mild nasal discharge when associated with sinusitis, were seen in about10% of the cases treated. The cause of this was mostcommonly material failure, i.e. a leaking occlusal seal withoutfurther loss of dental hard tissue or new tooth ssures/ fractures. Discussion and conclusion One advantage of the orthograde technique is that it can be performed on a sedated standing horse. This simpli es the whole session both for the operator and patient. There is relatively good visibility and there is seldom bleeding in the working area, which minimises the risk of contamination during the cleaning process. The ability to remove fluid from the prepared pulp cavity means that an acceptable canal preparation can be achieved without too much effort. Another advantage is that the treatment can easily be repeated once access to the pulp has been created, which means that a subsequent cleaning procedure can be quickly performed. However, the complexity of the hypsodont tooth, the need to have long-handled tools for the 07 -11s and to perform some of the preparation steps without having good visibility are disadvantages as regards cleaning out the pulp canals thoroughly. It can be dif cult to access the pulp canal in an older horse, or if the tooth has responded to an insult by laying down tertiary dentine in the pulp cavity. On the other hand, the maturation of the common pulp chamber in 2 separate pulp horns with separate roots makes it possible to save vital parts of the older tooth ( Fig 10 ). Although intraoperative x-rays are taken, in some cases it is dif cult tobe sure whether the les have reached apically enough and it is crucial to have a short-term follow-up endodontic treatment to check for discolouration or malodour of the original primary seal, that needs to be replaced if either are present. The most common cause of failure of this treatment was a later fracture of the treated tooth. This may be explained by pain relief after primary treatment and subsequent normal occlusal loads which in turn caused fracture of weakened parts of the tooth that were not identi ed. The absence of blood and nerve supply to the endodontically treated tooth will probably affect the response to occlusal load of the tooth, although a healthy periodontium will still react. The tooth will also be drier due to the lack of blood supply and will be less elastic. The continuation stulas or persistent discharge from sinusitis are most probably caused by the pulp canals and/or adjacent periapical area not being sufciently debrided. This could be due to an untreated canal system (Witherspoon et al. 2013), anatomical variation or inadequate canal debridement. Although there are some obvious dif culties in performing orthograde endodontic treatment on an equine tooth, our clinical experience shows promising results. Although the results have not yet been reported in a peer-reviewed journal, our success rate of about 80% is comparable to the outcome of follow-up reported in man by Bernstein et al. (2012). This indicates that endodontic treatment may be a good alternative to extraction in many cases. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

ADVERSE REACTIONS There were no adverse effects noted in the eld study which could be ascribed to diclazuril. To report suspected adverse react ions, to obtain a MSDS, or for technical assistance call 1-800-224-5318 . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The effectiveness of diclazuril in inhibiting merozoite production of Sarcocystis neurona and S. falcatula in bovine turbinate cell cultures was studied by Lindsay and Dubey (2000).1 Diclazuril inhibited merozoite production by more than 80% in cultures of S. neurona or S. falcatula treated with 0.1 ng/mL diclazuril and greater than 95% inhibition of merozoite production (IC 95) was observed when infected cultures were treated with 1.0 ng/mL diclazuril. The clinical relevance of the in vitro cell culture dat a has not been determined. PHARMACOKINETICS IN THE HORSE The oral bioavailability of diclazuril from the PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets at a 5 mg/kg dose rate is approximately 5%. Related diclazuril concentrations in the cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) range between 1% and 5% of the concentrations observed in the plasma. Nevertheless, based upon equine pilot study data, CSF concentrations are expected to substantially exceed the in vitro IC 95 estimates for merozoite production (Dirikolu et al., 1999)2. Due to its long terminal elimination half-life in horses (approximately 43-65 hours), diclazuril accumulation occurs with once-daily dosing. Corresponding steady state blood levels are achieved by approximately Da y 10 of administration. EFFECTIVENESS Two hundred and fourteen mares, stallions, and geldings of various breeds, ranging in age from 9.6 months to 30 years, were enr olled in a multi-center eld study. All horses were con rmed EPM-positive based on the results of clinical examinations and laboratory testing, including CSF Western Blot analyse s. Horses were administered PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets at doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg diclazuril/kg body weight as a top-dress on their daily grain rati on for 28 days. The horses were then evaluated for clinical changes via a modi ed Mayhew neurological scale on Day 48 as follows: 0. Normal, neurological de cits not detected. 1. Neurological de cits may be detectable at normal gaits; signs exacerbated with manipulative procedures (e.g., backing, turn ing in tight circles, walking with head elevation, truncal swaying, etc.). 2. Neurological de cit obvious at normal gaits or posture; signs exacerbated with manipulative procedures. 3. Neurological de cit very prominent at normal gaits: horses give the impression they may fall (but do not) and buckle or fal l with manipulative procedures. 4. Neurological de cit is profound at normal gait: horse frequently stumbles or trips and may fall at normal gaits or when man ipulative procedures were utilized. 5. Horse is recumbent, unable to rise. Each horse's response to treatment was compared to its pre-treatment values. Successful response to treatment was de ned as cl inical improvement of at least one grade by Day 48 \u00b1 conversion of CSF to Western Blot-negative status for S. neurona or achievement of Western Blot-negative CSF status without imp rovement of 1 ataxia grade. Forty-two horses were initially evaluated for effectiveness and 214 horses were evaluated for safety. Clinical condition was ev aluated by the clinical investigator's subjective scoring and then corroborated by evaluation of the neurological examination videotapes by a masked panel of three equine veterinarians. Alt hough 42 horses were evaluated for clinical effectiveness, corroboration of clinical effectiveness via videotape evaluation was not possible for one horse due to missing neurologic exami nation videotapes. Therefore, this horse was not included in the success rate calculation. Based on the numbers of horses that seroconverted to negative Western Blot status, and the numbers of horses classi ed as succ esses by the clinical investigators, 28 of 42 horses (67%) at 1 mg/kg were considered successes. With regard to independent expert masked videotape assessments, 10 of 24 horses (42%) at 1 mg/kg were considered successes. There was no clinical difference in effectiveness among the 1, 5, a nd 10 mg/kg treatment group results. Adverse events were reported for two of the 214 horses evaluated for safety. In the rst case, a horse was enrolled showing se vere neurologic signs. Within 24 hours of dosing, the horse was recumbent, biting, and exhibiting signs of dementia. The horse died, and no cause of death was determined. In the second ca se, the horse began walking stiffl y approximately 13 days after the start of dosing. The referring veterinarian reported that the horse had been fed grass clippings and possibly ha d laminitis. ANIMAL SAFETY PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets were administered to 30 horses (15 males and 15 females, ranging from 5 to 9 months o f age) in a target animal safety study. Five groups of 6 horses each (3 males and 3 females) received 0, 5 (5X), 15 (15X), 25 (25X) or 50 (50X) mg diclazuril/kg (2.27m g/lb) body weight/day for 42 consecutive days as a top-dress on the grain ration of the horse. The variables measured during the study included: clinical and physical observation s, body weights, food and water consumption, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, fecal analysis, necropsy, organ weights, gross and histopathologic examinations. The safety of dic lazuril top-dress administered to horses at 1 mg/kg once daily cannot be determined based solely on this study because of the lack of an adequate control group (control horses tested p ositive for the test drug in plasma and CSF). However, possible ndings associated with the drug were limited to elevations in BUN, creatinine, and SDH and less than anticipated wei ght gain. De nitive test article-related effects were decreased grain/top-dress consumption in horses in the 50 mg/kg group. In a second target animal safety study, PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets were administered to 24 horses (12 males and 12 females, ranging from 2 to 8 years of age). Three groups of 4 horses/sex/group received 0, 1, or 5 mg diclazuril/kg body weight/day for 42 days as a top-dress on the grain ration of the horse. The variables measured during the study included physical examinations, body weights, food and water consumption, hematology, and serum chemistry. There were no test article-related ndings seen during the study.
