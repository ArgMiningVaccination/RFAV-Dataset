How to use Vax Detox Kit Canine comes in a liquid form; this is the easiest way to administer it to animals. It can be put straight into the mouth of the animal, making sure not to contaminate the dripper. You can do this by adding the drops to a teaspoon, lifting the lip, and place in the mouth. But we realise this is not always an option. So you can add the drops to their food, which is just as effective. This is a three-remedy kit, and instructions are on each bottle.
