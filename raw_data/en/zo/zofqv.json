Summaries Of The News: [ ACA Premiums Rise 3.4% Due To Inflation, Uncertainty Over Subsidies ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/aca-premiums-rise-3-4-due-to-inflation-uncertainty-over-subsidies/) A new report finds that monthly premiums for 2023 Affordable Care Act insurance plans are higher than last year. That reversal in recent trends is attributed to inflation, increased health spending, and marketplace uncertainty over whether Congress would extend subsidies. [ Axios: Inflation Drove ACA Premiums Up ](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/04/inflation-drive-aca-premiums-up) Inflation and higher health spending helped drive monthly premiums for Affordable Care Act coverage up an average of 3.4% between 2022 and 2023, reversing a trend of recent declines, according to a new report from the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Why it matters: Some of the increase was also attributed to uncertainty over whether Congress would extend or make permanent premium subsidies, which complicated insurers' decision making. Extending subsidies would incentivize healthy people who choose to buy coverage previously deemed unaffordable.
