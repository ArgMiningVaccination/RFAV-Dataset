The evaluation of pancreatic diseases can be difficult due to the inaccessibility of the pancreas. There are multiple methods to evaluate the pancreas. Initial tests of the pancreas include a physical examination, which is difficult since the pancreas is deep in the abdomen near the spine. Blood tests are often helpful in determining whether the pancreas is involved in a specific symptom but may be misleading. The best radiographic tests to evaluate the structure of the pancreas include CAT (computed tomography) scan, endoscopic ultrasound, and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Tests to evaluate the pancreatic ducts include ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) and MRCP(magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography). There are also instances in which surgical exploration is the only way to confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic disease.

Warning Signs + 5 Things to Consider Did you know you could have an enlarged spleen and not even realize it? It's true. In fact, most people don't experience any noticeable symptoms of an enlarged spleen at all! Another surprise? Research shows that around 3 percent of healthy first-year college students have enlarged spleens. In some cases, people have genetically enlarged spleens, but it doesn't affect their overall health. However, for others, it can point to problems like an underlying infection, illness or developing disorder. So what exactly is an enlarged spleen, how can you tell if you have one and how can you treat it if you do? Turns out there are natural ways to deal with this common condition.

I have devoted my life to healing people since I became a licensed [Chiropractor](WhatIsAHolisticChiropractor.asp) in 1991. I was inspired by the care I was shown when I was recovering from a debilitating back injury when I was 21 years old. Since then I have dedicated my life and continually worked to better the lives of thousands of people. Whether you have [allergies,](allergies.asp) [asthma,](asthma.asp) [back pain,](lower-back-pain.asp) [hormone problems](hormone-imbalances.asp), or jaw problems known as [TMJ-D,](tmj-dtemporomandibularjointdysfunction.asp) My personal promise to you is I will work with you in developing a health care plan that will return your health to its highest level possible, and it is my promise to help you attain that goal. My website has been a labor of love. Throughout my site, you will find hundreds of articles I have personally written when I was inspired by my desire to help more people. In these articles, I offer information on various medical conditions and their symptoms. I also highlight the differences between traditional medical treatment and holistic alternatives, including [Chiropractic](WhatIsChiropractic.asp). This is to make you aware of ALL your choices before moving forward with ANY health care, not just the ones that involve medication and surgery. My intention is to help you to never need either of those forms of care for as long as you choose to live. And if you are currently receiving medical care in the form of prescription medication to hide your symptoms and never seems to end, then you are the person I want to consult with so I can offer you a TRUE solution to your condition, not continuous treatment and management. Beyond writing health articles for your consideration, I also record videos discussing various medical conditions, create an award-winning weekly newsletter, and host [a weekly radio program](http://www.TheAlternativeHealthcareNetwork.com) where I can share my expertise with the world. All available freely through my site. Health information should be free and supporting you in your time of need, or when you are healthy is my purpose. I hope this information helps you.
