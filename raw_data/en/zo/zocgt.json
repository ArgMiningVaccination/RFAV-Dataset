Titled \"Chinese Materia Medica -- Hidden Story of Healing Plants,\" the exhibition is staged in a sandstone cottage built in the 1860s, running from Thursday to July 20. It features captivating displays of Chinese herb specimens, interactive workshops, and special programs, such as Tai Chi performances. After seeing herbs, antique prescriptions, and botanic posters, people attending the event can gain insight into the history of traditional Chinese medicine and its contemporary applications. Meanwhile, there are workshops on the Chinese language and calligraphy, offering visitors an immersive experience of Chinese culture. Speaking at the opening ceremony held on Saturday, Vice-Chancellor and President of Western Sydney University Barney Glover noted that a key component of traditional Chinese medicine is an important representation of the symbolic relationship between humans and nature. \"I encourage you all to take the opportunity to learn more about traditional Chinese medicine and its modern-day applications and consider the broader relationship that we humans have with nature,\" Glover added. The event is an international collaboration between Western Sydney University and Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, and also in partnership with the Botanic Gardens of Sydney and the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
