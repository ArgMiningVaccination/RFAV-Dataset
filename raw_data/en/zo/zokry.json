Interactions Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) interacts with GOLDTHREAD The body breaks down cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) to get rid of it.

This might cause there to be too much cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) in the body and potentially cause side effects.

Goldthread might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications. Taking goldthread along with some medications that are broken down by the liver can increase the effects and side effects of some medications.
