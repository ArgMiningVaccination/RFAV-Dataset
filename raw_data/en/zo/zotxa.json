Composition: Curcuma longa, Cynara scolymus, 6/26 I.1 INTRODUCTION I.1.1 Description of the herbal substance(s), herb al preparation(s) or combinations thereof Herbal substance Curcumae longae rhizoma or turmeric, consists of the scalded of Curcuma longa L. (C. domestica Valeton) and curcuma. Besides C. longa also C. rotunda is mentioned in some older references. Nowadays C. rotunda is considered to be a former trade name for the product containing the primary rhizomes (bulb or round turmeric) in distinction to the product consisting of the thinner and longer secondary rhizomes (longa-form), both originating from C. domestica L. Ukon (Japanese) [113]. The European xanthorrhizae rhizoma a TLC-test for C. identifying C. xanthorrhizae [100] . The monographs of ESCOP and Commission E mention that the herbal substance contains not less than 2.5 resp. 3 percent dicinnamoylmethane deri vates, calculated as curcumin, and not less than 2.5 resp. 3 percent volatile oil, both calculate d on a dry-weight basis of the drug [108, 93]. Constituents (see also Fig. 1) Carbohydrates: 69.4% of total mass [2]. Curcuminoids: this curcumin [3-7]. Curcumin curcuminoid content in turmeric [8]. The phenolic groups in the structure of curcumin explain the ability of curcumin to eliminate oxygen-derived free radicals. [9] The free radical s which can be eliminated by curcumin are hydroxyl radical [10], singlet oxygen curcumin content of the Curcuma longa rhizome varies from 0.6 to 5% of the mass [15]. The dry turmeric Structures of main components of Rhizoma Curcumae longae [18]. Treatment of the herbal substance immediately after harvesting According to some handbooks the plant material is processed before drying [92, 93,108]. Hager's Handbuch describes that after harvest, the rhizomes ar e cooked for a short time or heated with hot water [44-46]. The Indian and Japanese Pharmacopoe ias also describe the 'curing', consisting of boiling and (sun) drying of the rhizomes as well as id entification by different color reaction tests. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia mentions: collection of rhizomes, washing, boiling or steaming, cutting in thick slices, sun drying and separation from roots [117]. Max Wichtl's Herbal Drugs mentions that the yellowi sh brown color of the herbal substance is due to the steaming or scalding treatment after harvesting [4]. As pharmacological and (pre)clinical studies do not c ontain any data on the pretreatment of the plant material, and research data on the scalding effect are missing, the impact of the scalding treatment on the active compounds c.q. efficacy of C. longa preparations remains unclear. The scalding treatment is considered to be a trad itional procedure mainly for food purposes. Herbal preparations, specified for the individual final product Powdered Curcuma longa in 85 g petroleum jelly [ 32], or a mix of 1 part of turmeric powder with 4 parts of I.1.2 Information on period of medicinal use in th e Community regarding the specified indication Curcuma longa has been documented in the following handbooks: Reference Indication \"Lehrbuch der Phytotherapie\" by R.F. Weiss (1974) [39] Hauptbestandteil auf als Magenmittel und bei Gelbsucht. Information on period of medicinal use outside the Community Experience with C. longa in traditional medicinal systems outside the EU In many Asian countries the use of turmeric as a food spice, colorant and medicine has a long tradition. China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Nepal Turmeric is used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine. It is official in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China as well as in th e Japanese Herbal Medicines Codex (JSHM, 1993) and is used in these countries and Korea for a range of indications including abdominal fullness, kidney pain, and amenorrhea. In China an aqueous decoction dosage form is ingested orally and applied topically [117]. India Turmeric is used extensively in the Indian sy stems of medicine (Ayurvedha, Unani, and Siddha) and is official (Haridra) in the Ayurvedic Ph armacopoeia of India (API, 1989). In Ayurvedic medicine turmeric has a long history of use as an anti-inflammatory drug for arthritis. In both the Ayurvedha and Siddha systems of medicine, a turmer ic paste is used topically to treat ulcers and scabies [117]. Superseded EMEA 2010 9/26 The Swami Prakashananda Ayurveda Research Centre lists as indications for turmeric: urticaria and skin allergy, viral hepatitis, in flammatory conditions of joints, sore throat and wounds [117]. I.2 NON-CLINICAL DATA I.2.1 Pharmacology I.2.1.1 Overview of available data regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof Documentation regarding the route of administration Oral administration is the main route of administration for Curcuma longa preparations. Curcuma longa can also be used topically and via inhalation (Ayurvedic tradition). Topical use of C. longa Turmeric is applied topically for the treatment of acne, wounds, boils, bruises, blistering, ulcers, eczema, insect bites, parasitic infections, zoster and pemphigus [18, 37,113]. It is used in the form of a paste or ointment (mix ture with oil or other substances), as a tincture or extract. However, no information could be found in literature on the composition of the products, the posology and the duration use. Phytochemical research data on major components in Curcuma longa Pozharitskaya et al. describe a HPTLC method to determin e the total of curcuminoids and determine curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin in Curcuma longa . A combination of HPTLC, with a diode array de tector (DAD) and post chromatographic DPPH radical derivatisation was developed to separate a nd quantify the free-radical activity of individual [47]. et al. and GC-MS. the lipoxygenase pathway [51]. Anti-depression The effect of curcumin was investigated in a rat chronic mild stress (CMS) model. In comparison with normal rats, rats suffering the CMS procedure have a significant lower intake of sucrose, increased IL-6, TNF- levels, CRF- and cortisol levels. Treatment with ethanolic extract increased the sucrose intake to normal control levels, reduc ed the CMS-induced increase in serum IL-6 and TNF- levels and reduced the CRF levels in serum and medulla oblongata to lower than normal. It also lowered the cortisol levels in serum to normal levels [20]. Superseded EMEA 2010 10/26 A turmeric ethanolic extract was found to prevent chronic mild stress induced increase of serum IL- 6, TNF-, CRF- and cortisol levels oxidize A [61]. reversed the decrease in serotonin, noradrenalin and dopamine concentrations as well as the increase in serotonin turnover, cortisol levels and the in serum corticotrophin-releasing factor Curcumin mobilizes -tocopherol this esults in protection against oxidative damage produced during atherosclerosis development. Curcumin increases VLDL cholesterol transport in plasma, which results in increasing levels of -tocopherol [52]. Cancer Curcumin inhibits cell growth by inhibiting expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and the angiogenesis factors vascular endothelial [53]. Curcumin induces blocks T-cell proliferation [56]. Curcumin reduces the testicular damage caused by to di-n-butylphthalate (DBP), by Glutathion (GSH), testosterone (G6PD) activity and decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. These effects may be due to intrinsic antioxidative abilities of curcumin [57-59]. Dietary curcumin inhibits [60]. Diabetes A and bisdemethoxycurc and ethanolic extract the hexane extraction (containing curcumin , demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin) were found to dose-dependently stimulate adipoc yte differentiation. The results indicate that turmeric ethanolic extract containing both curcum inoids and sesquiterpenoids is strongly hypoglycemic than either curcuminoids or sesquiterpenoids [22]. Hepatoprotective activity Curcumin protects cells against lipid peroxidation induced by paracetamol. This may be due to the antioxidative effects of the phenolic groups of curcumin [74]. phosphatase activity, cholesterol and phospholipid levels [62] . The exact mechanism of action is still unclear. Superseded EMEA 2010 11/26 Pharmacological phytotoxic, activity of an ethanolic extract of Curcuma longa (extract preparation not specified). The extract showed antifungal activity towards Trichophyton longifusus and Microsporum canis and weak antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus . Toxic activity was observed against Lemna minor . The LD50 in a [25]. Atherosclerosis A high-cholesterol diet given to New Zealand White rabbits leads to development of atherosclerosis in the rabbits. Rabbits given a dietary supplement of a Curcuma longa extract in combination with a high-cholesterol diet showed a positive effect on the animals' antioxidant status compared to controls. Curcumin has shown to mobilize -tocopherol from adipose tissue, thus protecting their body against oxidative damage produced during the development of atherosclerosis. Also more LDL cholesterol could be transporte d in plasma, increasing levels of -tocopherol. Overall the fatty acids in the animals were less susceptible to oxidation in the vessel wall [52]. Diabetes The effect of an ethanolic extract of turmeric on blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic KK-Ay mice and stimulated human adipocyte differe ntiation was investigated by Kuroda et al. The extract was prepared by a two time extraction of powdered tu rmeric, with five volumes of ethanol. The extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 12. 2 g of ethanolic extract. In the experiment on the human adipocytes a stimulation of adipocyte differentiation was observed. The activity of 5.0 g/ml and 10.0 g/ml ethanolic extract was more potent than that of 0.22 g/ml and 0.44 g/ml of troglitazone, which was therapeutically used as anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory drug in humans, until it was withdrawn in 2000 for causing drug-induced hepatitis [23]. Nishiyama et al. studied the influence of three turmeric extracts on blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic KK-A y mice. The extracts used were an ethanolic extract, a hexanic extract and an ethanolic extract from the residue of the hexane extraction. The ethanolic extract and hexanic extract were obtained from powdered Curcuma longa by extracting twice with five volumes of ethanol or hexane and filtration and evaporation of the solvent. The ethanolic extract from the residue of the hexane extraction was obtained usi ng the same method. To determine the mechanism of action the extracts were tested for adipocyte differentiation. No difference in bodyweight were observed between treated and control animals. The ethanolic extract stimulated adipocyte differentiation dose-dependently. The hexanic extract and the ethanolic extract from the residue of the hexane extraction showed similar effects but at higher concentration as the ethanolic extract [22]. Hepatotoxicity Soni et al. investigated the preventive effect of an a queous extract of turmeric on liver damage in ducklings induced by aflatoxin. The extract was pr epared by boiling 1 g of turmeric powder in 100 ml water. After concentration it was made up to 10 ml. The aqueous turmeric extract (10 mg/ml) inhibited toxin production by 99%. An alcoholic extract of turmeric showed inhibition as well, except on a much lower level. Turmeric and curcumin treatment showed almost complete reversal of fatty changes and necr osis induced by aflatoxin [29]. Mutagenicity Azuine et al. investigated the protective effect of an aqueous turmeric extract on chemically induced mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains and clastogenicity in mammalian bone marrow in female Swiss mice. The anticarcinogenic effects were assessed in the benzo(a)pyrene- Superseded EMEA 2010 12/26 induced forestomach neoplasia model. The extract was prepared adding 5 ml boiling distilled water to 50 mg turmeric powder. This w as mixed at room temperature for 20 minutes by vortexing at 150 rpm (Orbit Shaker, Lab Line). The supernatant was collected and lyophilized. Aqueous turmeric extract exhibited antimutagenic activity against direct acting mutagens. The turmeric extract also inhibite d the mutagenicity of benzo(a)pyrene in Salmonella typhimurium strains. Treatment with the aqueous tumeric extract inhibited the development of forestomach tumors induced by benzo(a)pyrene significantly. These findings were all dose- dependent [30]. The effect experimentally induced myocardial ischemic-reperfusion injury was investigated by Mohanty et al. Winstar rats were fed 100 mg/kg Curcuma longa once a day, for one month. Curcuma longa treated rats demonstrated significant anti-apoptotic property, which might contributed to the observed preservation in cardioprotective effects and cardiac function [63]. Pregnancy/neonates Singh et al. followed dams and their suckling neonates to determine the modulatory influence of turmeric on hepatic biotransformation system enzymes. Turmeric and curcumin induced a significant increase in hepatic levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and b5 and cytochrome P450 le vels were significantly elevated as well. This indicates that turmeric and/or curcumin metabo lites can be transferred through lactation [64]. Ulcers Kim et al. investigated the protective effect of Curcuma longa ethanolic extract against gastric ulcers by blocking H 2 histamine receptors (H 2R) of male Sprague-Dawle y (pylorus-ligated) rats. The extract was prepared by fluxing 100 g Curcuma longa with 80% ethanol. This was shaken at room temperature for 24 hours, this was perform ed twice. After extraction, the fluid was concentrated with rotary vacuum evaporator (E YELA, Japan). The ethanolic extract was dissolved in 100 ml H 2O and fractionated with organic solvents, nbutanol and ethyl acetate. For in vitro tests the dried material was resuspended in DMSO, for in vivo tests the dried material was resuspended in saline. The effect of Curcuma longa extract was compared to the effects of ranitidine. Curcuma was found to protect the gastric mucosal layer as effective as ranitidine. Orally administerd ethanolic extract (unknown amount) inhibited g astric acid, gastric juice secretion and ulcer formation comparable to the effects of ranitidine. Curcuma also suppressed histamine-induced cAMP production, caused by direct inhibition of H 2R, curcumin however had no effect on cAMP formation [24]. Rafatullah et al. investigated the antiulcer activity of an ethanolic extract of turmeric in inbred Winstar albino rats. The extract tested was a dried 96% ethanol extract. Administration of turmeric extract led to a significant decrease in ulcer inde x and acidity of stomach contents. Pretreatment with the turmeric extract reduced the intensity of ulceration induced by indomethacin or reserpine administration. Hypothermic-restraint stress reduction of gastric wall mucus, was inhibited by turmeric extract treatment. Treatment with turmeric extract reduced the severity of lesions induced by various necrotizing agents. Turmeric extract reduced the decrease in gastric mucosal non-protein sulfhydryl groups induced by administration of 80% ethanol [19]. Wound healing The woundhealing effects of Curcuma longa paste were studied in rabbits. The Curcuma longa treated group showed a significant higher mean value for contraction of the wound compared to controls. Furthermore the wounds showed less inflammation and an increasing trend in the formation of collagen [32]. Superseded EMEA 2010 13/26 Pharmacological activities of combination preparations No data available. Pharmacological activities of curcumin Antiplatelet property The antiplatelet property of ar-turmerone was investigated. Ar-turmerone showed strong inhibitory activity against platelet aggregation mediated by collagen and arachidonic acid. At higher concentrations curcumin showed the same effect. However, only a weak or no inhibitory effect was observed against PAF or thrombin act ivated platelets. The other components in the ethanolic extract showed no inhibitory effects [27]. Comparison between ar-turmerone and aspirin s howed that ar-turmeron inhibited platelet aggregation induced by collagen more effective and aspirin inhibited platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid 1.2 times more effective [27]. Cancer Curcumin was found to inhibit in vitro tumor cell growth by inhibiting expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in breast cancer- cell cultures and the angiogenesis factors vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and basic factors (b-FGF) [53]. Curcumin was effective in squamous-cell carcinoma model. The study of Li et al. showed a reduced occurrence of chemically induced tumors by 50 percent [65]. Curcumin blocks cyclosporine A-resistant phorbol myristate acetate + anti-CD28 pathway of T-cell proliferation and thus may be a potential adjuvant immunosuppressive agent for the treatment of cancer [56]. Farombi et al. carried out a study to determine the ameliorative effects of curcumin and kolaviron (a biflavonoid from the di-n-butylphthalate (DBP)-induced the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and the decreased testoster one levels were significantly increased [66]. The increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) we re decreased, which is in agreement with Ishihara et al. [66, 67]. This may be due to the intrin sic antioxidative abilities to combat oxidative damage induced by DBP [66]. Mice exposed to human prostate cancer cells were treated with curcumin. The curcumin-treated animals showed a decrease in microvessel density a nd cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis compared to controls [55, 68]. Incubation of endothelial cells from bovine aorta with curcumin (in a concentration range of 5-15 induction heme oxidative stress, by producing the antioxidant biliverdin, and it enhances resistance tot oxidative damage to cells [73]. The efficacy of curcumin or turmeric extract in reducing chemically-induced tumours in male Swiss albino mice was studied by Soudamini and Kuttan. The extract was prepared by extraction of 5 g of powdered turmeric with 100 ml acetone/methanol (45:55). The extract was filtered using filter paper. 40 mg of curcumin was dissolved in 5 ml acetone/methanol (45:55). DMBA was used to induce tumors. Single application of curcumin or turmeric extract failed to inhibit papilloma formation. A small, non significant, reduction in papilloma formation was seen in the turmeric extract treated group, compared to the control gr oup. Application of both curcumin and turmeric Superseded EMEA 2010 14/26 extract during carcinogenesis and promotion resulte d in less papilloma production, compared to controls. This indicates that both curcumin and tu rmeric extract produce their best effects during tumour promotion [70]. The effect of dietary on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12,0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-promote d skin tumor formation in Swiss albino mice was investigated by Limtrakul et al. They found a significant lower number of papillomas in the curcumin treated group compared to the control gr oup. The enhanced expression of ras-p21 and fos- p62 oncogenes were decreased dose dependently in the curcumin treated group [57]. Antioxidant properties Curcumin is not an or quencher of superoxide [71]. al. ts and several environmental mutagens in a Salmonella/microsome test with or without Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver homogenate (S-9 mix), in order to determine the difference between mutagens which require metabolic activation and those who do not. Curcumin inhibited the mutagenicity of bidi smoke condensate, cigarette smoke condensate and masheri (a tobacco product) and tobacco extracts in a dose-dependant manner. Curcumin is only antimutagenic against mutagens which require metabolic activation [72]. Diabetes Arbiser and Okamoto et al. reported that curcumin reduces the destructive angiogenesis associated with diabetic retinopathy [58, 59]. Hepatoprotective activity Tacrine is known for its T-cell destructive activity and hepatotoxicity. In a study with cultures of human hepatocytes, which had been destroyed by t acrine, curcumin showed to be nearly ten times more effective than the regular treatment, ascorbic acid [60]. However, a study on carbon tetrachloridetoxicity in mice, performed in 1996, showed no protective effects due to curcumin administration at dosages of 200 mg per kg [69]. Donatus et al. investigated the effect of curcumin on th e cytotoxic effect of paracetamol in rat hepatocytes. Curcumin showed no protective effect against induced GSH-depletion in hepatocytes of 3-methyl-cholanthrene pretreated rats. Curcumin in a concentration of 5 x 10 -5, 5 x 10-4 and 5 x 10-3 M protected the cells against lipid pe roxidation induced by paracetamol. This effect may be due to the two phenolic groups of curcumin, which give it strong anti-oxidant effects [74]. The effect of curcumin on alcohol induced hepatotoxicity in alcoholic rats were studied by Rajakrishnan et al. Compared to the control group curcumin administration resulted in a decrease of serum aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase activity. The levels of serum free fatty acids, cholesterol and phospholipids decreased as well [62]. Stress Xu et al. investigated the effect of orally administered curcumin on behavior in a chronic stress model of depression in rats. The molecular targ ets of curcumin were studied as well. The antidepressant imipramine was u sed as a positive control. Chronic curcumin administration (at 10 mg/kg) showed similar effects as imipramine. These findings suggest that the effects of chronic administration of curcumin on the behavior of chronic stressed rats may be related to the modulating effects of the dysfunction of the hypot halamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, through selective increase in brain-derived neurotropic factor in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of the rats [20]. Superseded EMEA 2010 15/26 Blood lipids In a small study with 10 healthy volunteers it was observed that oral intake of 500 mg/d curcumin for 7 days resulted in a significant decrease in the level of serum lipid peroxides (33%) and increase in HDL cholesterol (29%) and a decrease in level of total serum cholesterol (12%) [116]. Toxicity A study in which monkeys were fed 0.8 mg/kg of curcumin a day for 90 days and rats 1.8 mg/kg a day for 90 days showed no adverse effects [75]. I.2.1.2 Overall conclusions on pharmacology Results from in vitro and in vivo studies with whole extracts of Curcuma longa , and isolated compounds, support the traditional use of Curcuma longa. I.2.2 Pharmacokinetics I.2.2.1 Overview of available data regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof Little is known about the pharmacokinetic pathway of curcumin [76]. Doses up to 5 g/ml of curcumin added to microsome- and hepatocyte su spensions disappeared within 30 minutes [77]. In rats, 40-75% of orally administered curcumin is excreted in the feces. Blood levels of less than 5 g/ml indicate poor absorption from the gut [77, 78]. I.2.2.2 Overall conclusions on pharmacokinetics Available data suggests that curcumin is poorly absorbed from the gut, rapidly metabolized and excreted in feces. I.2.3 Toxicology I.2.3.1 Overview of available data regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof Donatus et al. found curcumin to be moderate cytotoxic. At a concentration of 5 x 10-3 curcumin slightly increased LDH-leakage from rat hepatocytes. This increase was accompanied by an increase in GSH-depletion, which can result in increased susceptibility to cytotoxicity [74]. Liver toxicity has been reported, but most of these incidents involved large dietary doses (turmeric 0.2%, 1.0%, 5.0%) or turmeric mice or rats [26]. No mutagenic effects were found in the Ames test s for curcumin and turmeric extracts (information on preparation could not be found) [79]. A single feeding of 30% turmeric diet to rats produced no toxic effects [75]. No effects on chromosomal damage, pregnancy rate , number of dead embryos, total implants and mutagenic effects were observed in mice fed with turmeric (0.5%) or curcumin (0.015%) [80]. In mice fed for 14 days with a diet containing 1% and 5% turmeric hepatotoxicity was observed [26, 81]. Rats fed with turmeric 1% for the sa me period showed no adverse affect. The rats fed Superseded EMEA 2010 16/26 turmeric at a dose of 5% of their diet for a period of 90 days showed a reduction in body weight gain and hepatotoxicity [26]. I.2.3.2 Overall conclusions on toxicology Neither Curcuma longa nor curcumin appear to be mutagenic, or toxic for embryos or implants. However, with a high (dietary) intake hepatotoxicity was observed. I.3 CLINICAL DATA I.3.1 Clinical pharmacology I.3.1.1 Pharmacodynamics No published data available. I.3.1.2 Pharmacokinetics In humans the estimated bioavailability of curcumin after oral administration is 65%. Cytochrome P 450 isoenzyme 1A1 is inhibited by curcumin a nd is metabolized by glucuronidation [28]. In a phase I clinical study subjects had average peak serum concentrations of 0.5, 0.6 and 2 M after taking 4-, 6- or 8-g doses of curcumin. Urinar y excretion of curcumin was not detectable [89]. I.3.2 Clinical Efficacy / Longst anding use and experience Medicinal uses of Curcuma longa have been reported in several European handbooks: - septic skin disease [40, 43] - liver 42, Posology and duration of use Turmeric is taken ora lly or applied on the skin. It is used as a powder (e.g. in capsules or to dissolve in fluid), as an ethanolic or aqueous extract, as p aste, ointment and as oil [15, 19, 30-33, 36, 64, 79, 80, 90-94]. There are no dose-response studies available. The foll owing posology is described in literature: 1.5-3 g of powdered turmeric root is usuall y for use against dyspeptic/digestive disorders [18, 92, 93,108]. Turmeric is taken in doses of 5-30 g daily for acute problems or 3-10 g daily for chronic problems in inflammatory conditions [95]. According to the Professional's Handbook of CAM, a three times daily dosage of 400-600 mg of curcumin or 8-60 g of fresh turmeric root is recommended in arthritis [97]. Superseded EMEA 2010 17/26 For chemopreventive use, the recommended daily do se of curcumin is approximately 500 mg per day [96]. This corresponds to a daily intake of 170 g of powdered turmeric of raw rhizome, when assuming that the rhizome contains an average quantity of curcumin of 3% [15]. Other dosage recommendations are: - powdered plant material: 1.5-3.0 g daily [18, 93, 99, 100, 108] - oral infusion: 0.5-1 g three times a day [4, 18] - tincture (1:10): 0.5-1 ml three times per day [18] In Germany, there are two preparations with C. longa dry extract (DER 13-25:1; ethanol 96%) on the market: As a 'WEU' product: coated tablet/h ard capsule with posology 3 x 30 mg/2 x 81 mg daily for dyspeptic complaints; as a 'Traditiona l Use' product: soft capsule with posology 3 x 13.5 mg daily to promote the digestion. In Poland, an oral liquid with turmeric extractum (DER 1:5, ethanol 70%) is authorized as medicinal product for traditional use for the symptomatic treatment of mild digestive disturbances and minor biliary dysfunction (posology 10 ml once daily or 5 ml in 60 ml water 3 times daily, respectively). In Spain there is one preparation containing C. longa dry extract (DER 5.5-6.5:1 , ethanol 50%) authorized as a 'WEU' medicinal product (posol ogy 2 x 1-2 tablets of 100 mg) for traditional use for the symptomatic treatment of mild digestive disturbances due to biliary dysfunction. See also Regulatory Overview. For topical application no clear indications for posology could be found in literature. Duration of use Information on the recommended duration of use could not be found. As clinical safety studies are lacking, it is proposed to limit the duration of use to two weeks. I.3.2.2 Clinical studies (case studies and clinical trials) Dyspepsia In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study of Thamlikitkul et al. (1989), 106 patients with dyspeptic complaints (such as abdom inal pain, epigastric discomfort, flatulence or belching) were treated daily for 7 days with 2 g of turmeric (n=38), a herbal combination including cascara and nux vomica and ginger (n=30) or placebo (n=38). At the end of the study 87% patients in the turmeric group, 83% in the herbal extr act mixture group and 53% in the placebo group reported a notable improvement. The difference be tween turmeric and placebo was significant and clinically relevant (p=0.003) [115]. Irritable bowel syndrome A partially blinded trail was performed with 207 volunteers with self-reported irritable bowel syndrome. Patients were divided in 2 groups: one was treated with 72 mg (1 tablet) and the other with 144 mg (2 tablets) of a standardized extract of tumeric extract (Cynara Lichtwer from Pharma UK), No data were provided on the extrac tion solvent and the compound(s) used for standardization. Intake of tumeric resulted in a significant reductions (compared to baseline) of IBS prevalence, 53% and 60% in the one- and two-tabl et groups respectively (p<0.001)) as well as in a significant decrease in pain and discomfort (22% and 25% in the one- and two-tablet group respectively). Also a significant improvement of quality of life, improvement of IBS and increased normal bowel pattern was observed [49]. However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. There was no placebo group in the trial, According to the authors there is \" little doubt that the placebo effect contributed to the improvement seen.\" [49]. Superseded EMEA 2010 18/26 Mutagens In a clinical trial performed in 1992 the effects of turmeric administration on urinary excretion of mutagens (in 16 chronic smokers and 6 non-smokers) were investigated. Turmeric was administered at a dose of 1.5 g/day for 30 days. The non-smokers had low excretion of mutagens at baseline, compared to smokers. Intake of turmeric by the smokers resulted in a significant decrease in urinary mutagen excretion, compared with baseline [82]. Peptic ulcers The effect of turmeric on peptic ulcers was studi ed in 2001 in an uncontrolled trial performed in Thailand. A group of 25 subjects received five doses of 600 mg of turmeric a day, for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks 19 subjects had no ulcers [83]. Cancerous lesions In the study of Kuttan et al. (1987) an ethanol extract of turmeric (\"Curcuma longa\") as well as an ointment of curcumin were found to relieve th e symptoms associated with external cancerous lesions. Reduction in smell was noted in 90% of the cases and reduction in itching in almost all cases. Dry lesions were observed in 70% of the cases, and a small number of patients (10%) had a reduction in lesion size and pain. In many patient s the effect continued for several months. An adverse reaction was noticed in only one of the 62 patients evaluated [31].

Short term effects of the herbomineral formulation were significant alterations in the se verity of pain and disability. Other changes like less morning stiffness, better grip strength and joint score, however, were not significant [38]. Scabies In a pilot study with 814 patients, a combination of turmeric and neem in the form of a topical paste was found to effective in treating scabies. 97% of the patients were cured within 3-15 days of treatment [33]. Pharmacological activities of curcumin Arthritis The efficacy of a combination of curcumin a nd frankincense was studied in a placebo controlled trail in 90 patients with osteoarthritis. Patients were treated for 32 weeks. After 16 weeks and 32 weeks of treatment a significant reduction in pain (P <0.05) was observed. The treatment resulted in a significant improvement in WOMAC (Western Onta rio McMaster University OA Index, Likert scale, version 3.0) scores (P<0.01) [84]. Deodhar et al. performed a double-blind clinical trial in which curcumin 1200 mg/day was compared with phenylbutazone 300 mg/day in 18 patie nts with rheumatoid arthritis. Both curcumin and phenylbutazone improved walking time, morning stiffness, a nd swelling, but only phenylbutazone improved 'fatigue time'. Both drugs were assessed as producing an overall improvement over baseline. However, the pa tients only rated phenylbutazone as better for controlling symptoms, compared with baseline [85]. Biliary effects In animal models an increase of the bile flow a nd the bile excretion were observed after intravenous administration of up to 500 mg/kg of an aqueous alcohol turmeric extract [109-112]. Gall-bladder function In a randomised double-blind crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers ultrasonic examination revealed that the contraction of the human gall-blad der is stimulated by a single oral dose of 20 mg of curcumin [91]. Cancer In an open clinical trial a curcumin 0.5% ointment was tested in 62 patients with skin and mucous membrane cancers. The ointment was applied thr ee times daily for a minimum of four weeks. A total of 68% of the patients responded (reduction in exudates 70%, lesion smell 90%, and pain 50%) [31]. Chronic anterior uveitis In an open clinical trial, curcumin was administer ed in an oral dose of 375 mg three times daily for 12 weeks to 53 patients with chronic anterior uveitis. Symptoms improved after 12 weeks of therapy in about 90% of the patients who completed the trial. 47% had repeated episodes of anterior uveitis in a [36]. EMEA 2010 22/26 Superseded EMEA 2010 23/26 Inflammation Human trials have demonstrated that a dose of 400 mg of curcumin, three times per day, can reduce postoperative inflammation as effectively as the NSAID phenylbutazone [87]. Pancreatitis Durgaprasad et al. investigated the effect of oral administration of curcumin with piperine in 20 patients with tropical pancreatitis on pain and markers of oxidative stress. The patients received 500 mg of curcumin in combination with 5 mg of piperine or placebo for a period of 6 weeks. A significant reduction in erythrocyte MDA levels was observed, as well as a significant increase in GSH levels compared to placebo. No effect was observed on the pain. These effects indicate that curcumin in combination with piperi ne reverses lipid peroxidation in patients with tropical pancreatitis [88]. I.3.2.3 Clinical studies in special populations (e.g. elderly and children) No published data available. I.3.2.4 Overall conclusions on (clinical) effi cacy / traditional medicinal use The use of Curcuma longa against dyspepsia, skin and liver diseases is well documented in a number of handbooks. The traditional use is supported by a substantial amount of data on the pharmacological effects of curcuma root, curcuma extract and curcumin. Howe ver clinical data is very limited. Only 5 trials have been published for curcuma (extract), of which one is placebo controlled and relevant as to the mentioned indications. The study of Thamlikitkul et al. performed in 1989, is the only placebo controlled trial performed with Curcuma longa . However the article contains very little information on the medical protocol used. For example according to the title of the article the trial was double-blinded but the article does not contain information on the blinding of th e clinical assessors. The comparison to placebo treatment with curcuma resulted in a statistically significant improvement of dyspeptic symptoms, yet no difference was observed with rega rd to the patient's satisfaction. Several trials were performed w ith curcumin. Not withstanding the fact that it is questionable if the activity of an isolated constituent can be used to justify the efficacy of a herbal medicinal product, the studies performed with curcumin have limit ed value for the monogr aph because they were performed with either a very high dose or with co mbination products. Furthermore the trials were conducted on diseases for which curcuma has no well est ablished use in the EU. In conclusion the available data is not sufficient to support a \"well established use\" indication for curcuma. I.3.3 Clinical Safety / Pharmacovigilance I.3.3.1 Patient exposure No data available. I.3.3.2 Adverse effects The Food and Drug Administration classifies turmer ic as a substance Generally Recognized as Safe [50]. No major side effects have been repor ted in the clinical studies [3, 49, 91]. Superseded EMEA 2010 24/26 No side-effects were reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with 1200 mg/day of curcumin for two weeks [85]. In a phase I trial with 25 subjects, who had various high-risk cancerous conditions, no toxic reactions were observed. The subjects received up to 8 g of curcumin a day for 3 months [89]. In a clinical study in patients with irritable bowel syndrome dry mouth and flatulence was reported by approximately 25% of the patients [49]. In another study two of 19 patients treated with 2500 mg of curcumin per day, complained of gastric irritation. No other adverse effects were reported [101]. In the study of Thamlikitkul mild side-effects as nausea, diarrhoea, headache, tiredness and sleepiness have been reported in the turmeric group (2 g/day) as well as in the other groups (placebo and comparitive herbal combination) [115]. Rare cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been re ported [102, 103]. In an 18-month study on the topical use of curcumin to treat skin and mucous membrane cancers, scalp itching was observed in 1 patient of 62 patients, [31]. Patch testing led to allergic reactions (not further classified) in persons who were regularly exposed to the substance or who already had dermatitis of the finger tips. Few allergic reactions (skin rash) occurred to peopl e not previously exposed to curcumin [104]. Pharmacovigilance problems have been reporte d for a product containing curcuma and a amino acid. Further study revealed that the observe d liver toxicity was not due to curcuma. Assessors comment : The inhibitory effects of curcuminoids on COXs correlates with the ulcerogenic activity in observed rats: ulcus index 8-10 times higher than control. These findings suggest that curcuma extracts should not be used by patients with duodenal/gastri c ulcers. However in a phase II study, a gastro protective action was observed in patients with pe ptic ulcer disease after oral intake of 600 mg curcumin 5 times daily [Prucksunand et al., 2001]. Therefore no contraindication for duodenal/gastric ulcers was included in the monograph. I.3.3.3 Serious adverse events and deaths No data available. I.3.3.4 Laboratory findings No data available. I.3.3.5 Safety in special populations and situations No data available. I.3.3.5.1 Intrinsic (including elderly and children) / extrinsic factors No data available. I.3.3.5.2 Drug interactions Turmeric may interact with NSAIDs, antiplatele t agents or antihyperlipidemics [94], although there have been no reports in humans [97]. The antiplatelet activity has only been observed in animal studies. Clinical data is lacking [97]. Therefore this interaction is not included in the monograph. Superseded EMEA 2010 25/26 Fetrow suggested that curcumin could decr ease the effect of immunosuppressants, although no supporting data was provided [97]. Reports on interaction between warfarin and turmeric are mainly based on in vitro data, animal studies or individual case reports. More studies ar e needed to confirm and assess the clinical significance of this potential interaction [105]. Several studies reported interactions between curcumin and other phytochemicals. When healthy human subjects took a 2 g dose of curcumin in combination with 20 mg of piperine, extracted from black pepper, the bioavailability of curcumin incr eased twenty-fold compared to subjects who took only 2 g of curcumin [106]. Green tea enhances the effect of curcumin. In Sw iss mice and Syrian golden hamsters tumor models the combination of catechin and turmeric was more effective than the individual components [107]. Recently it has been suggested that curcumin and green tea extract have synergistic effect in reducing oral squamous-cell carcinomas in hamsters [65]. I.3.3.5.3 Use in pregnancy and lactation There are no reports on the use of curcumin during pregnancy and lactaction [15, 92]. Singh et al. observed pharmacological effects in dams as well as their suckling neonates when turmeric and/or curcumin was administrated to th e dams. The results indicate that turmeric and/or curcumin metabolites (not specifically mentioned) can be transferred through lactation [64]. Hence the use of curcumin during breast-feeding is not recommended [92]. I.3.3.5.4 Overdose No toxic effects were observed after three months oral intake of 8,000 mg or 2.2 g of turmeric (equivalent to 180 mg of curcumin) a day for four months [89, 96]. I.3.3.5.5 Drug abuse No data available. I.3.3.5. 6 Withdrawal and rebound No data available. I.3.3.5.7 Effects on ability to drive or opera te machinery or i m pairment of mental ability No data available. I.3.3.5.8 Contra-indications Because curcum in was found to stimulate the gall bladder, the use of curcumin or turmeric is contraindicated in patients with obstruction of the biliary tract [18, 91, 92, 108]. This contraindication is also mentioned in the WHO monograph and in the Kommisson E monograph [18, 92]. I.3.3.6 Overall conclusions on clinical safety No serious side effects have been reported up to now. Furthermore the chemical composition of Curcuma longa does not give any reason for concerns regarding safety. Potential interactions between Curcuma longa and NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, antihyper- lipidemics and immunosuppressants have been reported, but this has not clinically been proven The Superseded EMEA 2010 26/26 use of Curcuma longa in pregnant women and during lactation is not recommended while there are indications that metabolites of Curcuma longa can be transferred through lactation. I.4 OVERALL CONCLUSIONS Curcuma longa has been used in Europe for a long time, mainly against dyspepsia, skin and liver diseases and infections. However, the available data is not sufficient to support a \"well established use\" indication for curcuma. As the medicinal use of curcuma has been documented continuously in European handbooks, C urcuma longa fulfils the requirements of Directive 2004/24 EC for classification of traditional herbal medicinal products. The use of Curcuma longa is considered plausible in the treatment of dyspeptic complaints on the basis of bibliography and pharmacological data. Although the use for skin diseases is also described in authoritative texts, it is not included in the monograph because no data coul d be found on the preparati ons and the posology. The pharmacological activity is attributed to the whole extract; however the majority of activities were also observed with curcumin. Curcuma longa is used in the following pharmaceutical forms and posology: - powdered plant material: 1.5-3.0 g daily - oral infusion: 0.5-1 g up to three times daily - tincture (1:10): 0.5-1 ml three times daily - dry extract (13-25:1): 80-160 mg daily, divided in 2-5 partial doses - dry extract (5.5-6.5:1): 100-200 mg 2 times daily - tincture (1:5) : 10 ml once daily or 5 ml in 60 ml water 3 times daily Only mild side effects have been reported for Curcuma longa : dry mouth, flatulence, and gastric irritation. No serious side effects have been reported. Due to lack of data, the use of Curcuma longa in children under the age of 18 years cannot be recommended. As relevant data on the use during pr egnancy and lactation is lacking, Curcuma longa can not be recommended in these cases.
