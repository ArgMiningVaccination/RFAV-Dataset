CDPH strongly encourages those eligible to get the vaccine to protect themselves and others. The vaccine is a two-dose vaccine given under the skin 28 days apart. Optimal protection is not achieved until two weeks following the second dose. Mpox vaccine appointment text message program The Illinois Public Health Association encourages gay and bisexual Illinoisans, residents with immunocompromising conditions, and anyone who may have been exposed to the mpox virus to schedule mpox vaccination appointments as soon as possible at local health departments statewide. Illinoisans can sign up to receive mpox care resources and vaccine appointment information through SMS text message. Registration for the service is free through IPHA's Know Mpox campaign. Anyone interested in signing up for this service should text \"Mpox+\" followed by their five-digit U.S. mail postal code to 36363.

We are still learning about how well the vaccine can protect you. Even after getting vaccinated, it is recommended you still take precautions, especially if you are at [high-risk for severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/faq.html) from mpox. Currently, the CDC is not encouraging vaccination against mpox for the broader public or for everyone who is sexually active. Second dose eligibility The full course of vaccine consists of 2 doses given at least 4 weeks apart. Immunity starts to build in the days and weeks after the first dose, although full immunity does not occur until 2 weeks after the second dose. Anyone who has had a first dose at least 28 days ago and who has not been infected with mpox virus is eligible for a second dose.
