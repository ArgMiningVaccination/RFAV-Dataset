What is mind-body medicine? Mind-body medicine is a broad term for therapies that involve deepening the connection between our sense of the mind and body. Central to this is developing awareness around your bodily experiences to tune more into your sense of self and how you want to be in the world. Schedule an intro session to learn which mind-body therapies would best address your needs. What is biofeedback? Biofeedback is a mind-body technique that uses visual and/or auditory cues to help create awareness around how your body is responding in the moment. Through increased awareness, you create the opportunity to alter your responses to achieve states of greater ease. What you should know before trying biofeedback - 1 Biofeedback is a safe, effective, and non-invasive treatment method. The best results are often achieved with 8 or more sessions. - 2 Dr. Sara uses biofeedback in conjunction with somatic based counseling as a way to support your goals towards making the physiological change you desire. Throughout this process, we often discuss emotions, explore physical sensations and reflect on your experience. - 3 During biofeedback sessions, you will be hooked up to various sensors that lay on the surface of your skin. These sensors pick up on physiological data involving your sweat response, heart rate, muscle tension, breathing, and temperature. You will be able to observe this data in real time. - 4 There is a home practice component for biofeedback sessions so that you are best able to achieve your goals during our treatment. During our first or second session, we will work together to create a practice schedule for you that feels achievable. "}
