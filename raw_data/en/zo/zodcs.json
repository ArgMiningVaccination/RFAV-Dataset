Urban population of India generates 62 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per annum. Only 43 million tonnes (MT) of the waste is collected, 11.9 MT is treated and 31 MT is dumped in landfill sites. India generates about 1.7 million tonnes of electronic waste and only 1.5% of the total e-waste generated is recycled. Biomedical waste generation is about 484 tonnes per day. It is the need of the hour that focus of waste management shifts to processing and resource recovery. Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) recognises this need and is organizing an advanced five-day training programme on \"Integrated Waste Management\". The objective of the programme is to get a better understanding of main features of the management of Solid, Plastic, Bio-medical, E-waste and C&D waste, the technologies involved in their treatment, the key legislative frameworks and the stakeholders involved. Some of the key takeaways for participants from this training shall be 1) Existing status of waste management in India 2) Major provisions of the new Waste Management Rules, 2016 and their status of implementation 3) Role and responsibility of different stakeholders 4) Inventorisation and Extended Producer Responsibility 5) Decentralised waste management 6) Use of IEC for behaviour change 7) Site visits to learn about best practices TRAINING METHODOLOGY: Lectures, case studies, class exercises, discussion and field visits FOR REGISTRATION: Kindly email at: neha.walani@cseindia.orgINTEGRATED 2 11/10/17 11:35 AMEDITOR'S PAGE WINTER IS closing in. The cold will bring inversion and trap the pollutants close to the ground where we breathe. But this year, I hope, we will breathe at least a little easier. Why do I say so? Let's take stock of what we have done and what needs to be done in the agenda for the right to clean air. First, there is the issue of public awareness. This is crucial and makes the difference between inaction and ac - tion. I believe, the air pollution concern is today widespread. Last winter's public health emer- gency\u2014 when pollution levels spiraled out of control\u2014 has brought about a clear understand - ing of the link between toxins and our bodies. From pesticide poisoning to water pollution, this body connection is hard to establish. More importantly, there is a cop-out option. For in - stance, in the case of water pollution, we don't connect the dying river to our taps. And if we do, there is always the option of installing a house- hold water filter, or just buying bottled water. So it is not our business to push for change. But air pollution is a great societal leveller. As I have written before, install all the air puri - fiers you want, but you will have to breathe air sometimes. Also, the nature of pollutants is mutating so fast that the air purifiers in our homes cannot keep pace. So, action is needed. We drive the change because it impacts our bodies; our children's health. Second, there is a plan for action. I find that most of the time ac - tion is lost because we have a million reasons why something else needs to be done and not anything specific. I'm not being facetious. This is a fact. Think about it. Last year, this time, with pollution choking us; my colleagues pushed for a smog emergency plan. This plan, goaded by the Supreme Court (SC), was notified by the Union environment min - istry in January 2017. Called the Graded Response Action Plan (grap), it lists a set of actions to be taken as and when pollution lev - els rise. Think of it as a disaster alert system, which requires taking tougher and tougher actions as pollution levels rise. The red alert is when things are out of control and the city comes to a standstill. But the aim is not to shut the city, but to work hard to implement each level of action, so that the city (region) does not need to take emer - gency action. This winter, the grap's very poor-severe category (lev - el 3 and 4) kick in on October 17 and will continue till the winter ebbs in late February or mid-March. This is being done to ensure that air pollutants don't escalate to the point of emergency (level 5). As per the plan, the following steps need to be taken: One, to close down the Badarpur thermal power plant, which adds to Delhi's pollution; two, to shut down brick kilns in the National Capital Region (ncr), that have not converted to zigzag technology \u2014much cleaner than the current method. And thirdly, to increase the watch on all things that contribute to air pollution, from construction, gar - bage burning to visibly polluting vehicles. This requires regular at - tention from the very top of the governance chain. Hopefully this will happen this year. The third big win is that based on this plan and the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority for ncr ( epca), a dense net- work of pollution monitoring stations will be set up in the region. So, for the first time, instead of getting a vague idea of pollution, we will know where the levels are spiking and so local action can be taken to control ambient air pollution. The fourth big win is that SC insisted on the introduction of BS IV fuel and vehicles in April this year. This will add to pollution gains. Trucks, which are the biggest contributor to ve- hicular emissions, will spew much less toxins. It's another matter that the gains of cleaner fu- els are being lost because of larger numbers of trucks and dirty tech - nology. But still it is an improvement. The fifth gain is the gradual reduction in the sale of private die- sel vehicles that are beginning to show up \u2014largely because of the 10-year age cap imposed by the National Green Tribunal and the closing of the price gap between the two fuels. That said there is an incomplete agenda that needs further at - tention. India imports and uses massive amounts of dirty fuels like pet coke and furnace oil. The emissions are deadly and uncontrolled. Then, there is the issue of the roughly 30-day period of crop burn - ing in neighbouring states. This agenda requires careful handling so that farmers have alternatives. We also need to move more of our vehicles, factories and power plants to cleaner fuels like natural gas. But let me stop here. The fact is that we know what to do. If we keep our focus and don't drop the ball, and keep taking action, then pollution will go away. Let's keep at it.

Although well-intentioned, it is intriguing that the magazine can't figure the reason that simple things are not getting done even when answers are available. Be it de-silting the Bhramaputra River, interlinking rivers or making more dams or any other scheme the government is so keen to put billions of rupees into, why are we unable to acknowledge there is big money to be made in all of this? While trapping rainfall or harvesting runoff is sensible, they do not involve the scale of concentrated money that would make politicians with foresight interested. For a forester or panchayat pradhan to make a mesh of trenches on a hillside for trapping rainfall needs approval of a politician, one who has no clue about rainwater harvesting. This should clearly tell us what is at stake, but we refuse to bell the cat. VINAY VIA EMAIL * Interlinking rivers will only add to the woes of India's `new' monsoon. It is sad to see that fllod related solutions are predominantly inclined towards engineering-based methods, which seem to control water rather than facilitate its flow in a manner which is conducive to the environment. JASPRIT KAUR VIA EMAIL * Faulty land use in flood plains and catchment areas are the main reasons for extreme heavy rain episodes. Deforestation, construction of roads and buildings are responsible for increasing runoff water, hence causing flooding. But there are many ways to restore the landscape. Afforestation activities can increase canopy cover and arrest the runoff. Besides reducing the impact of floods, this will also help store water underground and mitigate drought. ASESH LAHIRI VIA EMAILletters NDRF Down To Earth welcomes letters, responses and other contributions from readers. Send to Sunita Narain, Editor, Down To Earth , 41, Tughlakabad This regarding the article \"Raising superbugs\" (1 -15 September, 2017). In 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his radio programme Mann Ki Baat urged people to stop taking antibiotics without a prescription as a preventive measure against antibiotic resistance. He also stated that the government is committed to stopping antimicrobial resistance. This story should serve as a wake-up call for the government as currently we lack uncompromising statutes towards misuse of antibiotics in humans as well as animals. Significant action plans are required to address the mismanagement of poultry waste. Authorities should promote concrete measures such as biogas generation, curb antibiotic use in poultry and ban poultry litter as feed for aquaculture. The potential threats caused by these contagious pathogens are still latent, but at this rate, it won't take long for them to contaminate our environment and become an inexorable part of our food chain, evolving into an indomitable biological danger to us.

Since charging a battery of an e-vehicle takes hours, one way to offer relief could be to allow swapping discharged batteries with charged ones.

A K TANDON VIA EMAILletters VIKASH CHOUDHARY / CSE 6 09/10/17 3:19 farmers' income be doubled?\" (1-15 September, 2017). There are many variables which influence a farmer's income, such as seeds, fertiliser, labour and weather/ irrigation. All these are beyond the control of the farmer and can nullify the avowed aim of doubling farmers' income by 2022. One of the ways to help farmers is to encourage them to develop traditional seeds. Secondly, a mix of chemical fertilisers and farm manure can be cost effective and eco-friendly. Instead of debt-waivers, the government should ensure a sustainable Minimum Support Price and procure produce to avoid a glut in the market. L R SHARMA HIMACHAL PRADESH * Instead of improving the economic conditions of farmers, the government resorts to the temporary measure of a loan waiver. The government can either fix a minimum price for their produce or purchase it directly from farmers. It can also help them find alternative sources of income, such as village-based industries in which their family members can be involved. MAHESH KAPASI VIA EMAIL Harmful effects of LED The article \"Shadows of led\" (16-31 August, 2017) did not mention where Kapton tapes are available and how can they be applied on lamps and bulbs. JAYARAMAN VIA EMAIL Author's reply: Kapton tapes are used in 3D printing and are widely available in electronic shops and e-commerce websites. L ight Emit - ting Diode (led) is a small electric com- ponent (about 2X3 mm). While the most effective way to control the harmful blue light is to paste the Kapton/polyamide tape directly on the electric component, you can also paste it on the plastic/glass milky white diffuser. To use it on a led bulb, open the head of the torch and put the tape (1X1cm) directly on the bulb or on the plastic/crystal covering the led (See image above). * This is to thank you for featuring our initiative. Following the publication, we have received numerous responses thanking and enquiring on how to procure and use the Kapton (polyamide) tapes.

According to data from the Sample Registration Survey bulletin, from 37 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015, imr has decreased to 34 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016. Sachin Jain, a researcher working with Bhopal-based non-profit Vikas Samvad told Down To Earth that India still has a long way to go as far as imr was concerned. \u00aaChild marrriage, early pregnancy, neonatal mortality, bad quality of antenatal care, maternal malnutrition and privatisation of healthcare are the reasons why imr will remain high in India for quite sometime.\u00ba The US had an estimated imr of 5.8 in 2016, while Japan had the lowest, 2.0.

The last time it was spotted in the region was in 1905 by an Englishman named Brook in the then Raipur province of Central India. The camera traps were deployed grid- wise across 1,842 square kilometres during Phase IV of the Tiger Monitoring Programme that went on between November 2016 and June 2017 in the tiger reserve. While the species' population in the area has not been estimated, 4-5 grids had captured its presence. O P Yadav, the reserve's field director says his staff would work towards the animal's protection by giving it a proper habitat with food and water holes and ensuring minimum biotic interference. The Indian mouse deer faces severe threats in several parts of India since forest-dwelling communities hunt it for its meat. INDIAN SCIENTISTS from the Hyderabad-based International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics or icrisat , have led an international effort to decode and sequence the bajra or pearl millet genome for the first time. \u00aaWe have sequenced genome had not been sequenced till now since it is not important to the US and Europe, where research capacity is concentrated. And the research community in India and Africa, where the plant is a staple, were not technologically conversant. Moreover, 10 years back, this process would have cost a lot of money and time. Now, with better technology, this was a shorter and cheaper process. \u00ba Varshney and 64 other scientists discovered how bajra survives high temperatures and drought. According to Varshney, while cereals like rice or maize form their grain at lower temperatures, bajra can do so in temperatures of up to 42 C. Also, compared to wheat, rice or maize, bajra has a more diverse repertoire of genes for natural wax proteins, which act as thermal protection for the plant. The findings, published in Nature Biotechnology, could boost efforts to improve bajra's yields for millions of people in arid and semi-arid Africa and Asia. GST breather for sal plates, sabai ropes THE UNION government has reduced the Goods and Services Tax ( gst) on plates made from sal leaves and ropes made from sabai grass from 18 to 5 per cent. The gst Council took the decision in its 21st meeting in Hyderabad, agreeing to the request of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. On September 1, Patnaik wrote to the Union Minister of Finance Arun Jaitley, urging him to reduce the tax rate on Minor Forest Produce ( mfps). Both sal leaves and sabai grass are mfps that tribal communities depend on for their sustenance. In Odisha alone, 1.5 million forest-dwelling people earn their livelihood by collecting sal leaves, making plates out of them and selling the products. However, organisations working for tribal rights have claimed that any taxation on mfps is unjustified as it violates the spirit of the Forest Rights Act. The gst rates on other mfps will remain the same.

The Bondas are a primitive tribal group that are classified as one of the 13 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups ( pvtgs) in Odisha, with a population of 12,231, and a sex ratio of 1,040 women per 1,000 men according to the 2011 Census. They live mostly in the Khairput and Mudulipada blocks of Malkangiri. The Odisha government-appointed Bonda Development Agency ( bda) has attempted to bring the Bondas into the mainstream since 1977. Despite that, only 6 per cent of Bondas are literate. Their villages lack potable drinking water and sanitation. This, coupled with the lack of healthcare means that the Bondas have an extremely low life expectancy. \"The PM claims he's seen poverty from close quarters. His FM is working overtime to make sure all Indians also see it from close quarters\" \u2014Yashwant Sinha, Senior BJP leaderVERBATIM Wetland management decentralised THE UNION Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change ( moefcc ) has notified the new Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules 2017 which prohibit a range of activities in wetlands. The new rules will replace the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010. The new rules decentralise wetlands management by giving states powers to not only identify and notify wetlands within their jurisdictions but also keep a watch on prohibited activities. These activities include any kind of encroachment, setting up of any industry, expansion of existing industries, solid waste dumping, discharge of untreated waste and effluents from industries, cities, towns, villages and other human settlements, and poaching. As per the new rules, the Centre's role has been restricted to monitoring the rules' implementation by states, recommending trans-boundary wetlands for notification and reviewing integrated management of selected wetlands under the Ramsar Convention. But conservationists are not happy. Debi Goenka, Executive Trustee of Mumbai-based non-profit Conservation Action Trust told Down To Earth, \u00aamoefcc has simply shifted the onus to the state governments. This has been done to avoid any criticism from the Supreme Court. So the moefcc is just protecting its own neck. Conservationists' experience with state government wetland bodies has been extremely bad. They do not have any political will to protect the environment .\u00ba BY VIKAS CHOUDHARY 1,000 WORDS 13 09/10/17 3:20 PMPEOPLE LIVING next to the world's largest desert lake, Turkana Lake, believe it is both a blessing and a curse. Thirty-five-year- old Lolaramaya of Kenya's Turkana tribe says the shrinking Lake has pushed his community into a full-fledged war with the nomadic Dassanach tribe of Ethiopia to access the Lake and the grazing land arou-nd it. \"My parents were pastoral nomads, but I had to shift to fishing on the Lake for a living,\" says Lolaramaya of Todoyang village, which is Kenya's last village before the Ethiopian border. \"Due to regular clas- hes with the Dassanach tribe, I am strug- gling to even do fishing,\" adds Lolaramaya, while sitting in the courtyard of a defunct church with an AK-47 rifle and a leather pouch containing bullets. He says that for a routine fishing expedition to the Lake, which lasts for two days, he goes with at least eight other men, all armed and ready to fight the Dassanach tribe. So what turned two of the world's oldest tribes into enemies? The region's temperature has been rising\u20142 oC to 3oC between 1967 and 2012, going by a 2012 Oxford University report\u2014which has lead to unprecedented droughts and dwindling water resources. Add to that a series of developmental projects on the Omo River, which feeds 90 per cent of the water to the Lake. These reasons have not only left the desert region more arid, but also brought AFRICA Up in arms Shrinking of the world's largest desert lake has triggered a survival battle among nomadic tribes in the Kenyan-Ethiopian border. JITENDRA travels across Kenya's Turkana county to see how climate change and human activities have led to the crisisPHOTOGRAPHS: JITENDRA / CSE 14 DOWN 14-18Africa.indd 14 10/10/17 10:21 AMthe two communities in close contact with each other for livelihood. Soon, this led to a battle for monopoly over land and water. Under pressure Distrust has always existed between the two tribes due to their cultural differences. The Dassanach tribe believes that a boy has to show bravery and grit before he is consi-dered a man. For this, the boy has to attack an enemy\u2014usually the Turkana tribe\u2014and steal his cattle. Experts, however, say these cultural clashes were never widespread. The conflicts began to intensify when the fre-quency and intensity of droughts started to increase in the 1970s. Regular droughts affected the tribe in two ways: widespread livestock losses and shrinking of the 100-sq km long grazing area along the Lake (See 'Left out to dry'). The mortality rate of small livestock in the 1970s was close to 70 per cent, says a 2010 African Development Bank report. This forced thousands of Tur- kana families to move closer to the Lake and take up fishing, one of the primary liveli-hoods for the Dassanach tribe. Another fallout of frequent droughts has been the concentration of the tribe around the Lake because of international aid. The Oxford University report, Lake Turkana and the Lower Omo: Hydrological Impacts of Major Dams and Irrigation Developments, says humanitarian food aid since the 1970s \"has exacerbated tensions through resultant in-migration attracted by the opportunity to take advantage of food aid\". In fact, the population in the region has increased from an estimated 0.86 million in 2009 to 1.26 million in 2015, suggest government reports. \"Today, drought has become an annual feature in the region. It used to be just once every four years earlier,\" says Paul Obunde, planning and policy manager, National Drought Management Authority (ndma), Kenya. An internal ndma report, accessed by Down To Earth , shows the region faced droughts or received deficit rainfall in 13 of the last 16 years. Even the number of people affected by droughts is increasing every year. In 2017, 2.5 million people were affected in the region due to droughts, up from 1 million in 2013, as per the Ending Drought Emergencies in Kenya report, The entire Turkana region turned into a battlefield after the construction of Gibe III dam on the Omo River, which led to the shrinking of Lake TurkanaLeft to dry Gibe III dam constructed on the Omo, which accounts for 90 per cent of Lake Turkana's water inflow Gibe IV dam (proposed) Gibe V dam (proposed) Sugar plantation Farm lease Map not to scaleOmo River ETHIOPIAILEMI TRIANGLE KENYAS O U T H SUDAN The lake has shrunk and is now entirely located in Kenya AFRICA Todonyang village Lowerengak village In 2015, over 56 attacks happened in the 100 sq km grazing and fishing area Lake Turkana Turkana pastoralists such as Lokkwasinyan carry AK-47 when they take their cattle for grazing Kenya's Turkana county faced droughts or received deficit rainfall in 13 of the past 16 years.

But trends show that we have lesser rain year on year,\" says Obunde. The impact of climate change can also be gauged from the fact that Lake Turkana is shrinking even when 10 others Rift Valley lakes are growing in size. The Rift Valley lakes were formed due to a shift in the tec- tonic plates millions of years ago. Experts say that till recently, all the 10 lakes would flood and go dry at the same time. \"In August this year, while the Rift Valley lakes in central Kenya\u2014Naivasha and Elmen- teita\u2014registered higher than normal water levels, Lake Turkana had lower than normal water levels,\" says John Malala, a senior scientist with the government-run Kenya Marine Fisheries Research Institute in Turkana. In the name of development With the pastoral economy no more viable, the dependency of the Turkana people on fishing increased manifolds. The region turned into a battlefield after the cons- truction of the Gibe III dam on the Omo River, which lead to the shrinking of the Lake. \"Its construction commenced (in 2006) without any prior environmental and social impact assessment, Kenyan stakeholders were not consulted,\" says the Oxford University report. In early 2011, Ethiopia also started a large-scale irri- gation project for water-intensive sugar-cane plantation in the Lower Omo. Today, the Lake, which till recently extended to Ethiopia, has shrunk to Kenya. Even its salinity has increased. \"As a result, the Lake's fish production has reduced,\" says Malala. \"Both tribes claim their rights over the wetland and the Lake. The shrinking of the Lake means the Dassanach tribe now enters Kenya for livelihood,\" says Malala. He adds that tribes do not follow the political boundaries and rely on their cultural boundary, which changes with change in water source. No end in sight In the absence of political will and resour-ces, the Turkana tribe continues to live in uncertainty. In May 2011, the Dassanach tribe entered the Todoyang village and killed 65 people and injured hundreds. The incident created so much fear that over 1,200 people from the village fled overnight to Kalokal village, which is 100 km south of Todoyang. \"In response, we have killed more than 100 Dassanach people,\" says George Loiy- anda, the 52-year-old chief of Todoyang. He admits that some of his tribe men, whom he refers to as warriors, have been killed in the revenge clashes. Today, Todoyang has only 23 families and a military check post. \"The families that are left in the village today are either herders or shepherds, who need the grazing land,\" says Todoyang priest Mathew Idewa. The families in Todoyang say guns and not the government are helping them survive in the area. \"We always carry guns, not only to save Construction of Gibe III dam commenced in 2006 without any prior environmental and social impact assessment, or consultation with Kenyan stakeholders Kenya's Kalokal village along Lake Turkana is where the 1,200 Turkana families settled after they were attacked by Ethiopia's Dassanach tribe in 2011 16 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 2017 14-18Africa.indd 16 10/10/17 3:15 PM17 JAN 1-15 2016COURSE FEES R12,000 (Accommodation can be arranged nearby the training centre; it would incur extra charges) COURSE DURATION November 22-24, 2017 TIMING 9.30 am to 4.30 pm COURSE VENUE Centre for Science and Environment, 41 Tughlakabad Institutional Area, New Delhi - 110062 LAST DATE FOR APPLYING November 10th, 2017Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) is conducting a three-days training programme on 'Self Regulation and Environmental Auditing' to be held from November 22-24, 2017 at New Delhi. \"Self-Regulation and Environmental Audit\" is a tool to assess the status of compliance to regulatory and other requirements such as; performance of pollution control systems installed; conservation & conversion efficiency of input resources and finally for enlisting of the findings as shortcomings or gaps, to initiate corrective and preventive actions.

There are five specific causes. First is the is - sue of environmental resource, which has be - come a problem, not due to scarcity but mis - management. Second is the issue of cultural variations between the two groups. The third is the issue of contested territory. Fourth is the lack of basic government institutions \u2014 such as courts, hospitals and schools \u2014in both communities. Fifth is the proliferation of arms in both communities. A family in the region has on an average two AK-47 rifles. How are cultural differences triggering the conflicts? Cultural differences have a direct impact on the conflict. The Dassanach tribe believes that a boy has to show bravery and grit before he is considered a man. For this, the boy has to at - tack an enemy\u2014 usually the Turkana tribe \u2014and steal his cattle. This culture of violence needs to be transformed. Instead, the growing population, along with mismanagement of resources, has led to greater violence in the area. What steps have the governments of the two countries taken to bring peace in the region? The countries are continually introducing programmes to bring peace. But they do not have sufficient institutional mechanism to control the conflict. I saw people carry guns openly, even in front of the Army. It looks as if there is no pres - ence of the state institutions in the area? You cannot say the governments are not pres - ent. There needs to be a greater institutional presence in the area. What are the geopolitical reasons contribut - ing to the conflict in the region? The conflict between Turkana and Dassanach tribes is part of a wider geopolitical crisis in the area. Besides Dassanach, the Turkana tribe is in conflict with four other tribes: Topas from south Sudan, Dodoth from Uganda, Phokat and Samburu from other counties of Kenya. At the heart of the con - flicts is the disputed Ilemi Triangle which is spread across South Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. Governments in East Africa have re - cently set up the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development to manage conflict and bring peace in the region. What is your organisation doing in the area? We are currently engaged with 11 tribes in northern Kenya where we first identify the key underlying factors for their conflicts. Then we engage influential chiefs, religious leaders, youth leaders, women leaders in each community and train them to manage conflicts. We are also promoting inter-ethnic education, along with rehabilitation and reconstruction. `Mismanagement of resources is at the heart of the crisis ' Patrick Devine, executive chairman and co-founder, Shalom Center for Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation, Kenya, has researched the Turkana tribe and its conflicts with other tribes. In an interview with Down To Earth, Devine blames natural resource mismanagement for the conflicts engulfing the Turkana region the cattle, but also the grazing land from the Dassanach men,\" says Lokkwasinyan, a 27-year-old herder in Todoyang. \"They come in large numbers, attack our cattle and us, and use the land for grazing their cattle,\" says Loinggawa, another pastoralist from the village. While the Kenyan government does not maintain a registry of the clashes, me- dia reports suggest that in 2015, more than 75 people were killed and 25,000 cattle were stolen in 56 different attacks. Meanwhile, the government is making slow progress in the area. \"We are facilitating cross-border peace dialogues where people from both communities are made to meet and find peaceful solutions,\" says Selina Wanjiri, assistant secretary in the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government and a nodal officer working with the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, set up by the East African countries to bring stability in the region. She adds that in past meetings, communities have returned children, cattle and fishing nets that were stolen during raids. Experts say these small initiatives are unlikely to help, especially when the Ethio- pian government is planning two more dams and an irrigation project on Omo River. \"They will impact half a million additional people in the region,\" says Ikal Angelei of Friends of Lake Turkana, a non-profit wor-king on advocacy against dams and promo-ting livelihood of the Turkana people. The irrigation projects are being constructed for the proposed 175,000-hectares Kuraz sugar plantations and factories in Lower Omo that will be established on areas recently de-gazetted from the Tama wildlife sanctuary and the Mago and Omo national parks. \"The government has even identified Indian and Malaysian companies for the plantations,\" says Angelei. How can the crisis be resolved? The arms race in the region has to be checked by both governments. And at the same time, the eco- system in the region needs to be rejuvenated. \"Till then, the communities will not believe in the administration,\" says Paulson, a resear- cher at the Shalom Center for Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation, Kenya. The Turkana people say they are \"fed up of the clashes\". They are quick to add that they do not see an end in sight. n @journojitendraEthiopian government is planning two dams and an irrigation project on the Omo River, which will further impact the water flow in Lake Turkana 18 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 Indira Gandhi stadium was the venue of a grand event on October 2. A month before that, Isha Foundation, a Coimbatore-based non-profit that runs yoga and self-help programmes, had launched Rally for Rivers, an initiative to save India's rivers, under which a cavalcade of about 20 vehicles had travelled over 9,000 km, across 16 states, culminating in the function at the stadium. Launching the initiative at Coimbatore on September 3, the head of the Isha Foundation, Jaggi Vasudev, popularly known as Sadhguru, had suggested that a 1 km-wide green patch should be created on both sides of all the rivers of the country throughout their lengths. This would make people aware of the importance of rivers, control the micro-climate and reduce vulnerability to extreme rainfall events, he had said. Experts, however, are of the view that the idea is not just impractical, but lacks scientific basis. In an e-mail response to Down to Earth , Jaggi Vasudev (see 'Afforestation will stabilise rainfall patterns') said 4 million hectares (ha) is needed for planting these trees, of which 25 per cent is owned by the government, 65 per cent is private farm land and 10 per cent is delta. The government and private owners will be encouraged to turn their lands into agroforestry plantations, says Jaggi. This can be problematic. A study by the Rights and Resources Initiative, a global network advocating rights of RIVERS A cure worse than the disease Isha Foundation's Rally for Rivers initiative to plant trees alongside river banks appears impractical and lacks scientific rigour ISHAN KUKRETI new delhi 20 DOWN 20-21River.indd 20 10/10/17 3:16 PMSPECIAL REPORT www.downtoearth.org.in/forests indigenous people, and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in 2016, found conflicts over 1.2 million ha in the country. Another 4 million ha could only add to the problem, especially because India will be the world's most land-scarce country by 2050, as stated by the Economic Survey 2016-17. The belief that the trees will help control micro-climate is also not backed by research. On September 7, researchers from the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (atree), a Bengaluru-based research organisation, wrote in the Economic Times that the connection bet- ween land cover and climate change is quite tenuous, and so is the link between forest cover and river rejuvenation. They also said that at many places rivers are dying because of over-exploitation of groundwater and planting trees may aggravate the problem. Even the agroforestry idea is not practical. \"It will be profitable only in areas where the rivers are close to a timber market,\" says Soujanya Shrivastava of Delhi- based non-profit Centre for Science and Environment. n @ikukretiJaggi Vasudev, head of Isha Foundation, flagging off Rally for Rivers initiative in Coimbatore on September 3 COURTESY: ISHA FOUNDATIONHow much land is required for the plantation on river banks? All the major rivers in the country run for around 20,000 km\u2014 that means 40,000 sq km on the river banks (1 km on both sides of the river). Around 25 per cent of this land belongs to the gov - ernment (except in a few Himalayan states) and it must become forest (There is no data of land ownership on the riverside. This is an approximation from a state government's cursory men - tion about the ownership of land). This needs to be forested with native and en - demic forest species. The government land can be forested for a lateral dis - tance of over 1 km. Even the entire gov - ernment land can be converted to for - est land. This can be done quickly as it doesn't involve a lot of stakeholders. This intervention has the potential to exhibit change in microclimate and sta - bilisation of precipitation. Of the farm land, around 10 per cent is delta land which we can leave as it is. So 65 per cent is farmers' lands where we want them to shift from regular crops to tree-based agriculture. There is no need to acquire any land for the pro - posed solution. We want farmers to only transition from regular farming to tree - based agriculture. We have observed that when a farmer transitions from field-based crops to tree-based farming, his/her income multiplies. What is your view on water sharing between states? Right now there is not enough water flowing in a river. Even perennial rivers have stopped to flow all round the year. The flow in the Cauvery and Krishna riv - ers has fallen by 40 per cent, and the Krishna doesn't meet the sea for around three-four months a year. Given this scenario, the upper riparian and low - er riparian states are bound to fight for water. For example, there is a fight over the Cauvery between Karnataka, the up - per riparian state, and Tamil Nadu, the lower one. I am not on either side of the fight because I was born and grew up in Karnataka but now I am in Tamil Nadu. I am making it very clear, I am on the side of the Cauvery. For thousands of years, Cauvery flowed and there was no con - flict. It is only now, when the river flow has depleted, that the fight has started. So we need to augment the source to in - crease the water flow, so that both the upper and lower riparian states benefit. The entire work we are proposing is for revitalisation of rivers to augment the source of the river. We must burst the myth that only the upper reaches and origins of the river are the catchment. Will your drive help recharge water? The relationship of trees and rains is recognised scientifically. In our cul - ture this recognition is ritualistically followed by creation of sacred groves. These sacred groves were nothing but a composite of a threshold number of trees that seed rain. Especially in a leeward state like Tamil Nadu, where we get rains from receding monsoons, this was the only way rain happened in the inland areas. Our policy recommendation has been based on an extensive review of scientific literature, and with the in - volvement of experts covering the entire range or related scientific disciplines, including forest experts, hydrology ex - perts, and scientists from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. There is a strong consensus that afforestation will stabilise the micro-climate and rainfall patterns in a given region, lead to bet - ter retention of rainwater in the soil and recharge of groundwater, and lead to more stable rainfall due to rain seed - ing ability of trees from ET [evapotrans - piration] from the leaves and other rain seeding material (like pollens) that they give out. Details of the scientific ba - sis can be found in the draft policy rec - ommendation book that we will release shortly and open it for comments.

The aggressor is gaining land at a rapid pace, damaging the Latin American country's flora and fauna diversity. And India is fuelling this takeover, though in an indirect way. The invader is teak and India's appetite for teak wood is the reason behind the spread of the tree in Ecuador. The process started in 2013, when Myanmar, which was India's top source of teak ( Tectona grandis), banned felling of the tree. Ecuador filled the vacuum and is now exporting 95 per cent of its teak wood to India, states Ecuador's environment ministry data. The country's teak export to India has seen a 50 per cent spike since 2012-13. According to Xavier Elizalde, executive director of the Ecuado-rian Association of Producers of Teak and Tropical Timber, Ecuador is making a profit of $30 million a year from teak export. However, teak is not native to Ecuador and is exhibiting invasive behaviour to survive. The tree grows fast\u2014is ready to be cut in six to eight years\u2014and regrows at least six times if the main root is not damaged. It is difficult to uproot because the main root runs 6 m underground, drawing more than its share of water and minerals. What's worse, because teak is a non-native, there are no natural agents to quickly decompose its leaves. \"Since teak came, nothing else grows. Cotton, tomatoes, nothing,\" says Hacienda Vera, a teak farmer of Guayas province. And the growth in teak plantations has caused deforestation and loss of agricultural land. According to FORESTS Under siege India's demand for teak wood is endangering Ecuador's rainforests and agricultural land ISHAN KUKRETI | new delhi Ecuador has seen rapid deforestation in the past five years with farmers clearing patches to set up teak plantations 22-23Forests.indd 22 09/10/17 3:20 PMwww.downtoearth.org.in/forestsFORESTS Global Forest Watch, an initiative by the World Resources Institute to monitor forests across the world, Ecuador lost about 0.4 million ha tree cover between 2001 and 2015. About 30 per cent of this loss (0.18 million ha) was between 2012 and 2015. How much of this is due to spread of teak is yet to be studied, but trends point at teak. \"There are no nationwide figures, but teak plantations have increased in Ecuador over the years, especially in Manabi and Guayas provinces,\" says Nick Slobodian, director of Agroforestry for the Third Mill-ennium Alliance, a non-profit working on issues related to sustainable development in Ecuador. \"Inevitably, this expansion is at the expense of natural forests,\" he adds. An Ecuadorian environment ministry document titled, \"National Plan for the Restoration of Forests (2014)\", blames expansion of the agricultural land for deforestation. But experts contradict this. \"Recent studies point that crops culti- vated by marginal farmers, which feed the country, have not increased. Meanwhile, there has been a rapid growth in agribusiness\u2014African palm, sugarcane, eucalyptus, pine and teak plantations\u2014which is obviously the cause of this deforestation,\" says Nathalia Bonilla of Accion Ecologica, an Ecuador-based non-profit working on environmental issues. \"Many lands that are being occupied by teak are agricultural, owned by small farmers and contain great agrobiodiversity. The teak causes these crops to move, impacting food sovereignty and small-scale farmers. It should be noted that entrepre-neurs are looking for the best agricultural land for teak,\" adds Bonilla. Of South America's 12 countries, Ecuador is placed eighth in terms of food security, as per The Economist's Global Food Security Index. Teak troubles Alanso Dur\u00e1n, who owns an over 16 ha teak plantation in Guayas province, says that teak is a major drain on groundwater. \"I had a well that gave me enough water, but within two years of planting teak, the well started to dry and completely ran out of water. Teak absorbs so much water that the ground is left dry.\" Adds Bonilla, \"Since the phenomenon is recent, it would take time before studies corroborate what farmers are telling. But the signs are there for everyone to see.\" The tree is not even used by avian species as habitat. There are no Ecuador-specific study on teak-avian relationship, but one study published by the American Ornitholo- gical Society this year says that the number of bird species in teak plantations of Mizoram were almost half of those found in rainforests of the state \"Other trees have nests, but not teak. Even wasps don't dwell in these trees. Before teak plantations were set up, there were many animals here, but they have disappeared,\" says Servio La Chola, a farmer in Guayas. The impact of teak plantations in non- native ecosystems has also been identified by studies. \"As happens with other trees, teak has very different ecological effects, depending on whether it grows in native forests, or as a self-seeded invasive species (as in some of the Guayas landholdings and also in Thailand), or in industrial plant-ations (as in Guayas and also in Thailand). In monoculture plantations, teak makes the soil hard and the toxins in its leaves have more severe effects on other species. The larger the monoculture plantations, the worse the environmental effects,\" says Larry Lohmann of Corner House, a UK-based non-profit working on community rights and environment. \"When teak is extracted, the land is unprotected and has no minerals. We have to grow sicap\u00e9, a small plant that requires heavy watering, to restore the land. The plant is unfit for human consumption, but cattle can eat it,\" says Dur\u00e1n. Indian regulations are also causing a health hazard for Ecuadorians employed in teak export. Since 2003, India only allows import of teak that has been fumigated by methyl bromide, an endocrine-disrupting chemical banned in industrialised countries under the Montreal Protocol. In 2015, it was banned in Ecuador too. But India allowed Ecuador to continue teak export without fumigation till October 2016, when it was stopped. It resumed this January after India allowed Ecuador to use another chemical\u2014 aluminium phosphide\u2014for fumigation. But this chemical is also extremely harmful, and damages the liver and kidney. Despite these problems, the Ecuador government continues to promote teak cultivations. In 2015, the Ecuadorian agriculture ministry announced plans to develop 0.1 million ha of teak plantations by 2017. The ministry's Incentives Program for Commercial Reforestation provides subsi-dies for setting up forest plantations. \"The government ensured that in 2011- 16, over US $53 million were invested to set up 52,395 ha of forest plantations through this program. Of this, almost 20,000 ha are teak ,\" Bonilla says. \"What is needed here is not a ban on teak plantations, but an approach to grow the tree in a sustainable way,\" advises Slobodian. n @ikukreti Despite teak's invasive behaviour, the Ecuador government continues to promote the tree.

In India, the last coal power plant can be closed by 2050, argues CHANDRA BHUSHAN 26 DOWN TO district heaves a sigh of relief as she prepares breakfast on induct- ion stove and packs it for her daughters getting ready for school. They have scored well this year and a large part of the credit goes to the 500 Watt (W) rooftop solar panels and 3 kilo- watt hours (kWh) battery bank she and her husband, Mahesh, installed a few years ago through a bank loan. The system harvests and stores enough to supply round-the-clock power to all household appliances, including a refrigerator, a TV and an e-scooter. Sunidhi no longer trudges through the hillocks to collect firewood or waits for a cooking gas (lpg) refill. Her daughters study even after nightfall and can access internet anytime. Mahesh has also installed a solar water pump in his 2-acre (0.8 hectare) field for drip irrigation. Instead of paying hefty electricity and fuel bills, he now sells the excess solar power to a company\u2014aggregator\u2014 in Delhi. There are 20 such aggregators across the national capital who now pool renewable electricity from individual households and advertise their green credentials to woo consumers. The two big electricity distribution companies (discoms) have shut shop. Instead, there is one company in each municipality to manage the distribution grid. With solar and wind becoming the cheapest sources of power, there are less takers for coal, and the Coal India Ltd (cil) has started closing mines. Coal- SORIT / CSEINTERNATIONAL DAY OF CLIMATE STORYbased power plants now get paid by the government to be on stand-by. India revels in the democrati- sation of energy as hundreds of thousands of households and businesses turn \"prosumers\"\u2014they consume as well as produce electricity . To ensure universal access to basic electricity, the government offers subsidy to the poor through direct bank transfer, so that they can buy it from the aggregator of their choice. Cut to present. The government, with the target to connect 40 million households to the grid by December 2018 and curb rising electricity prices, is investing heavily in coal mines. It wants cil, the state monopoly, to produce 1 billion tonnes of coal a year by 2019-20; up from 554 million tonnes in 2016-17. It is looking to open new mines in the untapped 5,100 sq km coal bearing lands. New gas pipelines are being laid to make lpg available to all. In addition, an ambitious scheme\u2014Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana ( uday)\u2014is being implemented to revive discoms operating in the red. While all these efforts portray a bright future, the fact is India is chasing a dream that is far removed from reality\u2014the world is undergoing a massive energy transition. Over the next decades, there will be radical changes in the way we produce and consume energy. The conventional energy infrastructure being set up now would be abandoned even before their economic life is over. China is already experiencing this. Since 2010, China has added close to 300,000 megawatts (MW) of coal power capacity. Its current capacity is about 950,000 MW\u2014over three times that of India. However, between 2011 and 2016, the average operation hours of its plants have reduced\u2014from 5,305 hours of the 8,760 hours in a year to 4,165 hours. This means coal power plants in China operated at less than half their capacity in 2016. A report by Oxford University released in February 2017 estimates that investors in coal power may lose US $449-$1,047 billion because the assets would not be profitable to run or would be shut down due to environmental reasons. In the past five years, both the US Energy Information Administration ( useia) and Inter- national Energy Agency (iea) have downgraded their forecast on coal consumption. In 2013, useia in the International Energy Outlook Report forecast some 33 per cent growth in the global coal consumption between 2010 and 2040. Its 2017 report forecasts stagnation in coal consumption between 2015 and 2050. iea in its 2016 World Energy Outlook Report also predicts a halt in the growth of global coal consumption till 2040. In 2012, it forecasts an 18 per cent growth in coal consumption during 2010-2035. So, what prompted this sudden change in the outlook of useia and iea, which have consistently underestimated the growth of renewable energy. Analysing this would require one to have a thorough understanding of key forces that are influencing consumer behaviour and businesses worldwide, and thereby driving technological innovations. These driving forces reflect growing commitments across the world to achieve universal access to energy, growing demand for clean air and willingness to curb greenhouse gas emissions. COMMITMENTS TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL ENERGY ACCESS \"Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030.\" This is the 7th Sustainable Development Goal of the UN. Never in the history has so much focus been put on providing universal access to energy, especially electricity. Globally, about 1 billion people do not have access to electricity. Ensuring electricity to them requires an investment of nearly $50 billion every year till 2030. This is about 2 per cent of the annual investments made in the energy sector. Though there is a significant gap in the investments required for universal electricity access by 2030, the scale and pace of investments has increased worldwide. Electricity access investments in top 20 countries increased from $18.7 billion to $20.1 billion in just one year, during 2013-2014. Countries like Bangladesh and Ethiopia are investing 2-3 per cent of their gdp to primarily finance electricity access.

India, which is home to the largest population without access to modern energy services\u2014some 300 million do not have access to electricity and about half-a-billion primarily depend on polluting biomass for cooking and heating their homes\u2014will have near-universal access. The government has just announced a multi-billion dollar initiative to provide electricity connection to all by 2018. All these will have huge implications on the investments we are making today. For instance, so far, clean cooking fuel has meant provision of lpg or clean biomass cook-stoves. With improving access to electricity and advan- cements in safe and efficient electric cooking stoves, electricity will be the natural choice of cooking fuel. This is what happened when universal access to electricity was ensured in developed countries. GROWING DEMAND FOR BREATHABLE AIR In the past five years, poor air quality in cities has also attracted global attention. Deaths and diseases due to air pollution have cost the global economy more than $5.0 trillion annually. In India, the loss to gdp exceeds 5 per cent. To clean the air, local authorities are taking desperate measures. China has stopped constructing new coal power plants in polluted zones; Beijing now regularly shuts coal power plants. In India, for the first time, a power plant\u2014Badarpur Thermal Power Station in Delhi\u2014was closed to make air breathable during the winters. While Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City have announced plans to ban diesel vehicles by 2025, India and China are planning large-scale introduction of electric vehicles. This momentum towards clean air is triggering seismic shifts in the power as well as transport sectors. WAKING UP TO THE REALITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE This is the third but the most crucial driving force triggering changes in the energy infrastructure. The impact of climate change is hurting now, not only the poor but also the rich. The multiple hurricanes that have hit the US this year are estimated to have damaged hundreds of billions of dollars worth of property that will take many years to reconstruct. The simultaneous extreme rainfalls and droughts in India are hitting cities and villages alike. Heat wave fuelled forest fires are killing people in Europe and Asia. There is now an emerging consensus that action against climate change has to be taken now, and quickly. Despite US President Donald Trump withdra- wing from the Paris Agreement and failure of coun- tries to pledge significant emissions cuts in Paris, businesses and local governments are setting ambitious targets to tackle climate change. More than 75 of the world's biggest cities, forming the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, have pledged to substantially reduce emissions over the next three decades. In September, six top apparel companies, including Gap, Nike and Levi Strauss, joined hands with more than 300 companies from the apparel sector that have pledged to set science-based climate targets\u2014targets that are consistent with the aggressive emissions reduction pathways outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Clim- ate Change ( ipcc). The shift, though insufficient, is evident. In 2016, the world recorded the slowest increase in greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions since the early 1990s, except for global recession years. This is mainly due to two factors: lower coal consumption and increased generation of renewable power. In fact, global carbon emissions registered \"almost no growth\" from burning fossil fuels for the third consecutive year despite global economic growth exceeding 3 per cent a year. Technological innovations triggered by these driving forces are changing the way we know the energy sector. Here are five technological trends that are set to herald the massive energy transition worldwide. India will be heavily impacted by these as it has huge potential to leapfrog to a cleaner future . TREND 1 | Rapid decline in renewable energy prices: The prices of solar photovoltaic (PV) plants have plummeted in the past six years. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (irena), PV module prices declined by 80 per cent between the end of 2009 and the end of 2015. In India, the capital cost of solar PV plants reduced by 20 per cent annually between 2010 and 2016. Consequently, the cost of electricity from utility-scale (large) solar power plants nose- www.downtoearth.org.in STORYdived ` 12/kWh in December 2010 to less than `2.5/ kWh in May 2017. At present, the cost of solar power is 20 per cent less than the average price ntpc Ltd, India's largest power generation utility, charges for the power generated by its coal-fuelled projects. Wind power has also got cheaper, though the decline is not as dramatic as that of solar power. Globally, the weighted average capital cost of onshore wind has declined from $4,766/kW in 1983 to $1,560/kW in 2015, a reduction of two- thirds. Today, the lowest installed cost of wind power is in India and China. The wind power tariff in India also hit a record low of `3.46/kWh in February 2017 during a 1,000 MW bid by Solar Energy Corporation of India ( seci). This is cheaper than the power generated from coal plants using imported coal. In the latest 1,000 MW bid for wind power floated by seci, the tariff is projected to reach `3.3/kWh. These tariffs are projected to hit new low in the next 10 years. According to irena, from 2015 levels, the global weighted average tariff of solar PV could fall by as much as 59 per cent by 2025; onshore wind power tariff could fall by 26 per cent. TREND 2 | Battery gets efficient, affordable: In October 2016, Elon Musk of Tesla unveiled his Powerwall 2, a stack of Lithium-ion batteries that can store 14 kWh of electricity and last for over 15 years. Along with solar panels, the Powerwall has been designed to make homes go off-grid. Today, a typical upper-middle class family in India can go off-grid by buying two Powerwalls online at $12,400 (about `8 lakh) and a 10 kW solar rooftop plant costing about ` 6 lakh. The total cost of going off-grid today is equal to buying a mid-range car. In December 2016, Tesla installed a grid- connected battery storage facility for Southern California Edison, the electricity supply company for much of Southern California. The 80 MWh battery stores electricity when the demand is low and then feeds it back into the grid at peak hours. Earlier, this used to be done by gas-fired power plants. Tesla is now building a 129 MWh battery storage for South Australia to store electricity from wind farms and supply it at a steady rate to consumers. Tesla is not alone; many more compa- nies are investing in grid-scale battery storage with investment reaching $1 billion in 2016. Back home in India, pilot projects are underway on grid-connected battery storage system. In Puducherry, three technologies\u2014advanced lead acid, lithium-ion and alkaline flow battery\u2014are being tested for keeping the grid stable and Solar module prices have reduced by 80% across the globeSetting the stage for solar 3 2 1 00.75 0.70 0.65 0.60 0.55 0.50 Source: The power to change: Solar and wind cost reduction potential to 2025, IRENA2015 US$/W 2015 US$/WCrystalline, China Crystalline, Europe (Germany) Crystalline, Japan Thin film a-Si Thin film a-Si/u-Si or Global Price Index (Q4 2013 onward) Thin film CdS/CdTe2015 average Japan Brazil Ontario California Mexico United Kingdom Malaysia Germany South Africa ChinaIndiaMar 10 Sep 10 Mar 11 Sep 11 Mar 12 Sep 12 Mar 13 Sep 13 Mar 14 Sep 14 Mar 15 Sep 15 Mar 16 Capital cost of solar PV plants in India has reduced by 20% a year 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0 2010-11 Source: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government 2015-16 2014-15 2013-14 2012-13 2011-12Capital cost (J lakhs/MW) Power tariff from solar plants has reduced by 78% since 2010 12 8 6 4 2 0 Source: Centre for Science and Environment, 2017Lowest bid (J/MW) NSM Batch 1, 2010 NSM 2017 Bhadla 2017 28-39Cover Story.indd 30 10/10/17 10:45 AMFive days training programme ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR MINING AND MINERAL INDUSTRY For details contact: Rahul Kumar, Sr. Research Associate, Impact Assessment Unit Centre for Science and Environment 41, Tughlakabad Institutional Area, METHODOLOGY: Lectures, case studies, class exercises and discussions.

For registration: Kindly email at: rahul.ismu2012@yahoo.co.inThe Center for Science and Environment (CSE) is conducting a five-day training programme aimed at giving practical inputs to participants on conducting sector-specific Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for mining and mineral industry from 6-10 November 2017. The minerals sector is a key driver of the country's industrial growth. However, it has brought in its wake severe environmental repercussions and social conflicts. One of the greatest challenges, therefore, is how to make mining environmentally and socially acceptable. Unfortunately, most environment assessment reports either overlook or poorly interpret critical issues related to mining projects. Hence, there is a genuine need to develop the capacity of those involved in the mining industry, including environmental consultants, mining operators, project proponents, compliance authorities, academics and NGOs to understand the issues, and identify and implement solutions for the overall interest of communities and the nation. What the participants will learn 1. Legislative framework\u2014environmental clearance (EC), forest clearance (FC), land acquisition (LA), Forest Rights Act (FRA) and bio-diversity clearance process. 2. Overview of mineral exploration, mine development and mining technologies. 3. Overview of mining operations, issues, impacts and challenges. 4. Filling of Form 1 as appended in EIA Notification, 2006. 5. Developing terms of reference (ToR) for mining projects. 6. Data collection, collation and interpretation of functional areas\u2014land use, air, water, hydrology, geology, noise and vibrations, waste management, soil conservation, ecological and biodiversity, socio-economic factors, and risk and hazards. 7. Tools and techniques for impact assessment. 8. Preparation of an environmental management plan (EMP), including budget estimates. 9. Mine closure plans and case studies on mine reclamation in India. 10. Environmentally sustainable practices like district mineral foundation (DMF), corporate social responsibility (CSR), and star-rating of mines. 11. Review of the quality of EIA reports. 12. Quality Council of India (QCI) accreditation process for EIA consultants. Selection will be done on first come first basis 31GRP EIA Course ad November 6 \u00d0 10, 2017.indd 31 11/10/17 11:42 AMCOVER STORY to facilitate integration of renewables by storing energy during the daytime and using it during night. A 1,400 kWh Giga-Capacitor-based energy storage system is under operation in Hyderabad. Giga-Capacitor is a high voltage capacitor designed to store electrical energy electrostatically. The examples show that today we have batteries that can store electricity at utility scale and act both as a large base-load plant (like a coal-fired power plant that continuously supplies a constant amount of electricity) as well as a peaking plant (like a gas-fired power plant that can start immediately and provide instantaneous peaking power). And these batteries are improving at the rate of knots. The battery of the future will store more power, charge and discharge rapidly, be more stable and safe, and, most importantly, be cheaper by 70-80 per cent from today's batteries. The price of batteries is tumbling. Lithium-ion prices have dipped by over 50 per cent since 2010. According to a report by kpmg, the storage cost of Lithium-ion battery in India is likely to fall from `12.6/kWh now to `3.5/kWh by 2025. With `3.5/kWh as storage cost and `3/kWh as generation cost from a solar rooftop plant, an average household in India can go off-grid in 2025. This is because in 2025, a household with solar rooftop coupled with battery storage will pay `6/ kWh compared to `7 charged by discoms. TREND 3 | Houses, household appliances become super-efficient: More than 80 countries, which account for most of the global energy con - sumption, have set energy efficiency standards and labelling (eesl) programmes for appliances and ve - hicles. The coverage of mandatory energy efficiency regulations in industry, buildings and transport has nearly doubled, rising from 14 per cent of the world's energy consumption in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2015. According to iea, energy efficiency impro- vements helped restrain the growth in final energy demand of the world to just one-third of the level it would otherwise have been. The momentum to - wards energy efficiency is such that despite signifi - cant reduction in energy prices in 2016, invest - ments in energy efficiency increased that year. According to useia, the trend in energy efficiency improvements would continue and contribute significantly to the reduction in the global energy intensity. Even with doubling of per capita gdp and 25 per cent increase in global population, the global energy consumption is projected to increase only by 28 per cent in 2040 By 2025, Lithium-ion battery cost would reduce by 70% from 2015 levels By 2025, grid-independent solar houses in India will become a realityOff-grid India: A dream come true by 2025 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 014 12 10 86 4 2 0 Source: Telsa Motors, US Depatment of Energy's EV 2018 Levelised cost of storage J/kWh 10 8 6 4 2 0 Source: The Rising Sun: Disruption on the Horizon , KPMG, November 20152025 2022 2020J/kWhUtility cost of service Solar rooftop costs Solar with partial storage to be grid independent Energy efficiency of domestic appliances have improved by a factor of 6-8 in 30 years The silent revolution 60 WATT In 1990s7 WATT In 2017Energy consumed - Bulbs 150 WATT In 1980s28 WATT In 2015Energy consumed - Fans 150 WATT 150 WATT In 1980s24 WATT In 2017Energy consumed - TV 1 BTU/W In 1990s7 BTU/W In 2017Energy efficiency ratio - Room AC 1,200 units/year In 1980s200 units/year In 2017Energy efficiency ratio - Fridge 32 DOWN 2017 28-39Cover Story.indd 32 10/10/17 3:17 PMCOVER STORYcompared to 2015 levels. Consequently, the energy intensity of gdp (amount of energy consumed to produce $1000 gdp) is projected to reduce by half during this period. The fact is there has been a silent revolution in energy efficiency of most domestic appliances, which has improved by a factor of six to eight in last 30 years. In the 1990s, an incandescent bulb consumed 60 W and a ceiling fan consumed 150 W. Today, we have led bulbs, which consume 7 W and last up to 20 times longer than incandescent bulbs, and fans that consume 25 W. In the 1980s, a 24- inch crt TV consumed 150 W. Today, a similar size led TV runs on 24 W. The energy efficiency ratio of an AC has increased from 1 British Thermal Unit (btu) per Watt in the early 1990s to 7 btu/W and above. Similarly, the energy efficiency of a fridge has improved six times. We are entering an era of super-efficient appliances. With large-scale installation of solar PV and proliferation of distributed generation, such as solar mini-grids in rural areas and solar rooftops in urban, DC appliances with double the efficiency of AC appliances will become mainstream in a decade. Similarly, it is possible today to build commer- cial and residential buildings that consume 70 per cent less energy than the conventional building, with a payback period of less than five years. The 2017 version of Energy Conservation Building Code (ecbc) already mandates at least 25 per cent energy savings in new commercial buildings and has provided a roadmap for buildings to achieve the Super ecbc status by saving 50 per cent energy. By making ecbc mandatory for all building classes and further strengthening the star rating programme for appliances, India can easily improve the efficiency of buildings by a factor of three by 2030. TREND 4 | Electricity becomes prime mover: Globally only 21 per cent of the final energy is con - sumed in the form of electricity. Direct use of fuels like oil, gas, coal and biomass contribute the re - maining 79 per cent of the final energy. These fuels are used in transport, industry and in buildings for heating and cooking. Today, we have technologies that can eliminate direct use of these fuels and re - place those with electricity in practically all sectors, other than aviation, ships, heavy duty road trans - port and industries like cement, iron and steel, fer - tiliser and petrochemicals. According to iea, the world's demand for electricity would grow by 70 per cent between 2014 and 2040, and, more than half of the demand will be met by renewables. In 2016, for the first time, the electricity sector edged ahead of the oil and gas sector to become the largest recipi - ent of energy investment. This is largely because the market anticipates quick shift to electricity in cer-tain sectors. Though transition in the industry would take longer, the two sectors where transition from fuels to electricity will happen quickly are electric personal vehicles and induction cooking. Almost every major automobile company in the world has either introduced or has plans to introduce electric cars in the near future. And, all this has happened in the last few years. First, China made a big move towards e-vehicles: 750,000 electric cars were sold in 2016, taking the electric car stock to over 2 million; 40 per cent of those were sold in China. Recently, India has announced its plan to \"bulldoze\" petrol and diesel vehicles with e-vehicles by 2030. Global EV Outlook 2017 , the number of e-vehicles on the road will increase to 40-70 million by 2025. However, some automobile analysts are more bullish and predict that one in every three cars sold by 2030 would be electric.Globally 40-70 million electrical vehicles could be on roads by 2025 Shifting gears on mobility... Note: The Reference Technology Scenario (RTS) policies that have been announced or are under consideration.

China alone has 200 million electric two-wheelers; India has 0.5 million. But, all major two-wheeler companies in the country are coming out with new models of electric two-wheelers. As per the target set by the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of hybrid and Electric vehicles ( fame) scheme of the government, India should have 25 million electric two-wheelers by 2020. Most industry analysts believe the target can be reached by 2025 if incentives are properly targeted. Similar to rapid growth in e-vehicles, induction cooking is likely to grow rapidly. Induction cooking has emerged as the most efficient and cheapest method of cooking. Today, a single-stove induction stove is available at less than `2,000. A family of five can reduce their cooking fuel bill by at least 30 per cent compared to lpg by shifting to induction cooking. Should India leapfrog from dirty solid cooking fuel to induction cooking or should it invest in building lpg infrastructure? This is an important question for the government, spending billions of dollars to provide universal access to electricity. TREND 5 | Smart grids take over : A smart grid is an electricity network that uses digital and other advanced technologies for managing and real-time monitoring of electricity from all sources, especially renewable energy, to meet vary - ing electricity demands of end-users. Smart grid allows the grid to become bi-directional and thus promotes consumers to become sellers, enables greater penetration of renewable energy and supports efficient demand side management, including enabling suppliers to charge different tariff of electricity at different time of the day (Time-of-Day tariff) to reflect demand and supply. The market size of smart grid is estimated to be $220 billion by 2020 and $500 billion by 2030. Many countries are already piloting smart grids or moving towards smart grids. In India, the work on smart grids started in 2010 with the constitution of India Smart Grid Task Force ( isgtf) and the India Smart Grid Forum (isgf). isgtf is an inter-ministerial group to provide policy direction. isgf is a non- profit voluntary consortium of public and private stakeholders to accelerate development of smart grid technologies. In 2015, the government launched the National Smart Grid Mission (nsgm) with a budgetary support of `338 crore. The Ministry of Power (m op) has sanctioned 11 pilot projects across the country with different functionalities of smart grid. In addition, under uday scheme, smart meters are being installed for larger consumers at the feeder, distribution and transformer levels. India is looking at the smart grid not only from the perspective of integrating renewable energy, but also from the perspective of solving some of the fundamental problems at the distribution level, such as high transmission and distribution losses, power theft, frequent load-shedding and low voltage. Smart grid technologies allow many of these problems to be solved. For instance, Smart Meters and Advanced Metering Infrastructure are likely to reduce theft and improve billing at consumer and distribution transformer level. Substation renovation will improve quality of power supply. So, in short term, smart grid will help discoms improve the quality of services and reduce losses. But in the long term, it will pave the way for unbundling of the distribution sector and thus lead to the demise of large discoms. The five technological trends will have a profound impact on the very architecture of the energy system in India. Let's look at two fundamental impacts: end of coal and end of large integrated discoms. BEGINNING OF THE END In mid-January 2017, strange news appeared in almost all major newspapers: India does not need new coal power plants till 2027, other than the 50 GW capacity under construction. This was announced by the Central Electricity Authority (cea), the country's main electricity planning authority. Any talk about slowdown was a heresy till a few years back. Projections were made for the need of new coal mines to produce 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 2020, largely for power generation. A study by Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment shows during 2007- 2012, environment clearance was awarded to 220,000 MW worth of coal power plants and there was a frenzy to get more plants cleared. So, what happened to all these proposed plants? What has led to this turnaround? cea's poor forecasts on electricity demand and how they would be met is responsible for this turnaround. cea has consistently forecast very high growth rate in the electricity demand in its Electric Power Survey ( eps) that never materialised. eps is published every five years 34 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 OCTOBER 2017 28-39Cover Story.indd 34 10/10/17 10:47 AMCOVER STORYand charts the roadmap for growth in the sector. The result of the overestimation by eps resulted in overcapacity in the coal power sector. In addition, cea has traditionally downplayed renewable energy till the present government announced a target to install 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. The implications of higher demand forecast has been that during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17), capacity of 99,209 MW was commissioned against a target of 88,537 MW from conventional sources. It is for the first time in the history of the Indian power sector that 112 per cent of the target was achieved. If we add the renewable energy installed during 12th Plan, then in April 2017, India had 327 GW of installed capacity against a peak demand of 160 GW. Consequently, the coal-based power plants operated at a plant load factor ( plf) of 60 per cent\u2014this means they operated at just 60 per cent of their capacity. The plf of coal power sector is not likely to improve if we compare electricity demand over the next 10 years and the capacity of existing power plants as well as those under construction and in the pipeline, especially solar and wind plants. 2021-22 | PLF of coal power sector reduces further: According to the latest 19th eps pub- lished in 2017, the projected electricity require - ment and peak demand for the entire country for 2021-22 is about 1,566 billion units or Billion kWh (BU) and 226 GW. For 2026-27, the projected electricity requirement is 2,047 BU and the pro - jected peak demand is 299 GW. The annual growth rate in electricity requirement in the next 10 years is forecast to be 6 per cent, similar to the growth experienced in the past 10 years. Now, let's consider the new power plants being installed or targeted to be installed in coming years: During 20 17-22, about 50 GW worth of new coal-based power is likely to be commissioned. By M arch 2022, 2,800 MW of nuclear reactors will be commissioned. About 15 GW of hydropower plants are likely to come on-stream by 2021-22. About 4 GW of gas-based power plants are likely to be commissioned by 2022. I ndia has set a target to install 175 GW of renewable energy by 2021-22. As 57 GW was already installed till 2016-17, an additional 118 GW needs to be installed in the next five years to meet the target. But this target is not likely to be met due to regulatory and market issues. Instead 125 GW installation of renewable by 2022 is realistic. So, India will install only 70 GW between 2017 and 2022. If all these plants are commissioned, then the projected installed capacity by March 2022 is likely to be 470 GW. This is more than enough to meet the electricity requirement and peak load requirement for 2021-22. In fact, the plf of coal power plants will reduce to 50 per cent in 2021-22. In other words, India will have far more installed capacity than actual electricity demand by 2021-22. But what will happen in 2026-27? Will CEA overestimated the demand for electricity in 17th EPS, published in 2007 YearEnergy demand forecasted (BU) in 17th EPSActual Energy requirement (BU)Difference in energy forecast vs. actual requirement (%)Peak energy load demand forecasted in 17th EPS (GW)Actual peak energy load demand (GW)Difference in peak load forecast vs. actual peak load (%) 2013-14 1,085 1,002 7.6 156 136 12.8 169 148 12.4 153 16.8 2016-17 1,392 1,142 18.0 218 160 26.6 18th EPS, published in 2012, also overestimated demand of electricity for 2021-22 and 2026-27 by a wide margin YearEnergy demand forecasted by 18th EPS (BU)Energy demand forecasted by 19th EPS (BU)Difference in energy forecast between 18th and 19th EPS (%)Peak energy load demand forecasted by 18th EPS (GW)Peak energy load demand forecasted by 19th EPS (GW)Difference in Peak energy load between 18th and 19th EPS (%) 2021-22 1,905 1,566 21.6 283 226 25.2 2026-27 2,710 2,047 32.4 397 299 32.8 All-India electricity and peak load demand forecast by 19th EPS, published in 2017 Source: Central Electricity AuthorityElectricity its electricity demand in 2026-27 with whatever capacity it has in 2021-22? 2026-27 | Installed capacity of non-fossil fuels exceeds fossil: According to cea's projections, the momentum in the renewable energy sector will lead to an addition of another 100 GW renewable power capacity between 2021-22 and 2026-27. cea also projects installation of 12 GW hydropower capacity during 2022-2027. In addition, 4.8 GW capacity nuclear plants are likely to be commissioned by 2026-27. cea's modelling shows that if these capacities come on-stream, India will not need to install any coal or gas based power plants during 2022-2027. The coal capacity existing in 2021-22 would be more than sufficient to meet energy and peak load demand in 2026-27. In fact, plf of coal power plants in 2026-27 will reach barely 60 per cent. In 2026-27, for the first time, the installed capacity of non-fossil fuels will exceed fossil fuels. Coal and gas will contribute only 46.5 per cent of the installed capacity. The remaining will be from renewables, hydropower and nuclear. Still in 2026- 27, 65 per cent of the electricity will be generated from coal- and gas-based power plants. The remaining will come from non-fossil fuels; about 16.5 per cent of the generation will come from solar and wind plants. 2031-32 | Final straw on coal power plants: The world after 2026-27 will belong to renewable energy. During 2017-27, for every 1 MW of coal capacity addition, India is projected to install at least 3 MW of solar and wind power capacity. By 2026-27, wind and solar power, not coal-based power, will dominate the energy sector. So, will India need new coal power plants post-2027? This depends on two factors: one, cost competitiveness of coal power plants vis-\u00e0-vis renewable energy projects, and two, sufficiency of coal power capacity of 2027 to meet the requirements of 2032. As illustrated in the beginning, solar and wind will be the cheapest sources of electricity for a consumer in India in 2025. Large solar and wind plants with partial storage and rooftop solar plants with full storage will compete with coal and gas power plants. So, economically there is no rational to install new coal power plant. But what about the technical requirement of the grid? 19th eps projects a 4.3 per cent annual growth in electricity requirement and 4.4 per cent growth in peak load requirement between 2027 and 2032. The peak load demand in 2031-32 is projected to be 370 GW and electricity requirement is 2,531 BU. For the sake of grid stability, if we assume that the proportion of electricity produced from various sources in 2026-27 remains the same in 2031-32, then about 1,560 BU of electricity will have to be produced from coal power plants in 2031-32. It will be possible to produce this electricity even with 242 GW of coal power plants existing in 2026-27. The only change will be that plf of plants will increase from 62 per cent in 2027 to 74 per cent in 2032. This is a most desirable outcome, as 75 per cent plf is considered optimal. So, neither India will have to install coal power plants between 2022-27, as predicted by cea, nor will the country have to construct additional coal power plants during 2027-32. This means, the coal 2021-22: India will have 470 GW plant capacity; more than sufficient to meet all peak load demand of 160 GW, India installed capacity of 327 GW this Source: Centre for Science and Environment, 2017 36 DOWN TO 10/10/17 3:18 PMCOVER STORYpower plants operational and being constructed today will easily meet our electricity requirements till 2032. After 2032, India will not need to set up new coal power plants as setting it up would become expensive compared to new solar or wind plant coupled with full storage. As coal plants will have the highest plf in 2032, coal consumption in 2032 will be the highest and then start reducing. Assuming that 0.65 kg of coal is required to produce 1 kWh, in 2031-32 India will consume about 1 billion tonnes of coal in the power sector. So, India's coal consumption for power will peak at 1 billion tonnes by 2031-32 and then start reducing. If we assume economic life of coal power plants as 30 years ( mop assumes it as 25 years), then it is possible to phase out most coal power plants by 2050 and replace them with non-fossil fuel plants. Below is a possible scenario of how this phase out will happen. In this scenario, by 2056-57, India's coal power capacity will be 30 GW\u2014one-sixth of the current capacity \u2014and then the last coal power plant can be closed by 2061- 62. As one can see that post-2022, some new coal power plants will have to be installed, but they are not additional capacity. They will be installed to replace old power plants. If we assume economic life of coal plants as 25 years, the last coal plant could be closed in 2050. REIGN OF BIG INTEGRATED DISCOMS COMES TO AN END Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (uppcl) is responsible for the transmission and distribution of electricity to 200 million people in the state. It manages transmission infrastructure of about 30,000 circuit (ckt) km and distribution infrastructure of more than 40,000 ckt km; serves 16.5 million consumers and supplies 45,000 MW of electricity.

The discoms in India are bankrupt and surviving on sops from the government. The latest comprehensive data for all discoms is available for 2014-15. That year, discoms incurred loss of `1 lakh crore. They had a total outstanding debt of `4.07 lakh crore and their net worth was in minus `2.43 lakh crore. The Aggregate Technical & Commercial losses today stand at 25 per cent. The important issue to consider is that states with a high renewable energy potential and target have discoms in poor financial health. If we consider the target for 2022 set by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (m onre), then most of the renewable power\u201483 per cent of the 175 GW\u2014has to be installed in 10 states. These top 10 states account for the lion's share of poor balance sheet of discoms in India. About 72 per cent of the total losses in 2014-15 and 73.5 per cent of the accumulated losses were accounted by the discoms of these states. About 80 per cent of the total outstanding debt was accounted by the discoms of these 10 states. Large-scale penetration of renewable power will make their discoms even more unviable. According to a report by renewable energy consultancy firm Bridge To India, the tariff charged to commercial and industrial consumers by these discoms is so high that currently it is viable for these consumers to shift to solar rooftop during the daytime. By 2020, in all states solar rooftop will be the cheapest source of power for commercial and industrial consumers. In fact, in 2020 in all major states like Maharshtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh, solar rooftops with storage will be cheaper than grid tariff for commercial and industrial consumers. These high-paying consumers are likely to move to solar rooftops, putting pressure on the finances of discoms. In fact, open access based on renewable energy is going to be even a bigger threat. Under the Electricity Act of 2003, a consumer with a connected load of 1 MW and above can buy power from the open market and not from discoms. They have to pay for using the grid. An open access consumer can also install dedicated mega-watt scale renewable energy project off site and use the grid to consume that power. According to a report titled \"India's journey towards 175 GW Renewables by 2022\", published by the Prayas Energy Group in 2016, the cost of solar power through open access in various states is already cheaper than their utility tariffs for commercial and industrial consumers. The open access along with reducing cost of solar energy and storage technology is likely to be a game-changer in future. It is possible that within a decade, high-paying consumers (including gated communities) would start moving away from discoms and set up their own or have some other entity set up renewable energy projects with electricity storage facility to enable 24x7 power supply. They will use grid and local distribution network as a transmission platform and pay charges to the grid operator for transmitting that power. Once this happens, it will make discoms unviable. Large consumers will move to large decen- tralised projects and small consumers towards solar rooftops and building integrated systems.

The job of the distribution company, like trans- mission companies, is to maintain the distribution infrastructure and charge for using it. Any produ- cer, trader or aggregator should be able to use the transmission and distribution infrastructure and provide power to consumers. The unbundling of electricity sector along with smart grid will revolutionise the way we produce and consume electricity. We will have hundreds of thousands of \"prosumers\" who will buy and sell power, thousands of mini-grids and millions of off-grid homes. Similar to Germany, renewable energy capacity would be owned by citizens, panchayats, cooperatives, factories and commercial establishments and not big utilities. Virtual power companies would emerge. They will collect power generated from individual rooftops and renewable power plants and sell to other consumers. They will have no asset of their own. This will be the \"Uber model\" in the electricity sector. Energy storage companies will also emerge who will install big utility-scale electricity storage devices and provide electricity to the grid for balancing, peaking and even base-load requirement. The energy efficiency market will also become big with Energy Efficiency Service Companies selling efficiency products to consumers. And, these Energy Service Companies will sell energy services like lighting, heating and cooling, not electricity. Once this happens, we will live in a world of watts and not kilowatts as super-efficient appliances would become a norm. As e-vehicles would be the biggest segment of the automobile sector, building and vehicles would be integrated. The current petrol pumps would get transformed into electric power charging companies as batteries would get charged in less than 10 minutes. As distributed generation would proliferate, more and more electricity would be consumed onsite with surplus flowing into the grid. Grid of tomorrow will be like the internet of today. In the above world, we will have some large utilities (even fossil fuel based), but they will be on stand-by for balancing loads. They will be flexible. They would get capacity charge (feed-in-tariff) to remain on stand-by. But what will happen to the poor? If the rich move out of the centralised distribution system, who will cross-subsidise the poor? The answer is that the rich will cross-subsidise the operations of the grid and the distribution network. As they will use these infrastructure, they should be charged higher to cross-subsidise the poor. As far as electricity is concerned, the government can provide direct subsidy to the poor to provide minimum electricity need. This is the only way India can decarbonise the electricity sector and provide energy access to all. But is government envisioning and planning for this future? The answer is no. Talking about \"end of coal\" is a taboo. Predicting demise of large discoms is considered absurd. But the fact is that the government is putting in places policies and plans \u2014 though in a fragmented manner\u2014 that can end coal in the 2050s and unbundle distribution sector even much earlier. The government is aggressively promoting large renewables and decentralised renewables. Net metering policy is practically in place for solar rooftop in all states. Open access is allowed but is being resisted by discoms. The government has also put in place an ambitious plan for e-vehicles that will have huge implications on the transport sector and on the economics of batteries. It is promoting star rating for energy efficiency in appliances and buildings; though it needs to be more aggressive on this. It is investing in smart grid and meters. And, the politics of the day demands that access to electricity is provided to all, at the soonnest. If all the reforms are put together, the world of Sunidhi of Madhya Pradesh's Jhabua district will become real in 2030. n @Bh_ChandraOf the 175 GW renewable power to be installed by 2022, 145 GW has to be installed in 10 states, with high energy potential. Discoms of these states account for 70% of All-India lossesStates with highest 20.0 15.0 10.0 0 is what it does: store water. The Sardar Sarovar Project now faces the toughest challenge of delivering water to the fields and homes of the people of Gujarat. An analysis by DARSHAN DESAI AND AKSHIT SANGOMLA SIXTY-FIVE-YEAR-OLD Chhaganbhai Sankhavra does not remember for how long it has been drummed into his ears that his village, like thousands others, will soon have waters from the Sardar Sarovar Project ( ssp). Since his childhood he has seen politicians of all hues selling the dream of irrigation water from ssp. One might have been tempted to think that his dream would at last be fulfilled when ssp was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 17, 2017; more than 56 years after the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had laid down the foundation stone. Sankhavra though points towards the irony that there is water in a Narmada canal a few kilometres away but his village can't get it. \"You can see the water, but you don't get it,\" Sankhavra, who is the sarpanch (village head), says wryly. Just a shout away from Rajkot city, the hometown of Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Madhapar, is no way a village with as many as 44 housing societies and a population of over 40,000, but in every other way it is one of the hundreds of villages of Saurashtra region where you can see the water but can't get it. The source of this irony 40 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 OCTOBER 2017 40-46Analysis.indd 40 10/10/17 10:50 AMANALYSISSardar Sarovar's ta nker trail lies in the failure of the Gujarat government to build the most crucial part of the project, the canal network to distribute water from the Sardar Sarovar dam. Distribution glitch A large dam's essential purpose in irrigation is storage of water and aiding its distribution. The canal distribution network takes the water to the farmers' fields. For the distribution of ssp's water in Gujarat, it has a 458 km long main canal and 38 branch canals which spread into distributaries that further branch into minor and sub-minor canals. Field channels form the final stretch of the delivery system. The extent of this network also defines the command area of the project within which the irrigation water can be supplied. The Gujarat government has brought down the originally planned length of the canal network from 90,389 km to 71,748 km, Nigam in August 2017. ssnnl, owned by the state government, executes ssp's work. But why did the government reduce the canal network when farmers like Sankhavra are waiting for the water? Tushar Shah, a senior fellow of the International Water Management Institute (iwmi), tells Down To Earth that \"many former command areas are now urbanised and have been de- commanded\". This could be a possible reason for the revision of canal length. Suresh Mehta, the Chief Minister of Gujarat from the Bhartiya Janata Party (bjp) from October 1995 to September 1996, is highly critical of the move. He says, \"It goes without saying that a reduction in the canal network means reduction in the area under irrigation.\" He also cites a lapse of procedure. \"The government has to take the permission of the Narmada Control Authority for any change, but who bothers,\" he says. He quit the bjp in 2007 in protest against the \"entire party leadership succumbing to the whims and fancies of one person (Narendra Modi)\". As of August 2017, according to ssnnl, 31 per cent of even this revised canal network is still to be built. If we use the originally planned length this percentage shoots up to 46 per cent. Most of this network is of the minor, sub-minor and field channel types without which farmers at a distance from the main and branch canals will remain without water for a much longer time. As per a Memorandum of Under- standing signed by the Central and the state governments under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme ( aibp) in 2015 the canal network had to be finished by 2016-17 for which the work needed to be carried out on \"war footing\", according to the Central Water Commission ( cwc) which monitors ssp for central loan assistance under aibp. This clause has not been fulfilled with the canal work still ongoing. The length and expanse of canal network also indicate the irrigation potential of a project which is the area that can be irrigated by it at full potential. According to ssnnl, for ssp, this currently stands at 1.42 million hectares up to minor level, while up to sub-minor level it is 1.09 million ha as against the planned 1.79 million ha and 1.84 million ha respectively. The actual area irrigated by the project is given by the utilised irrigation potential, which is often a fraction of the irrigation potential. For example, in 2013, cwc found the irrigation potential of ssp to be 0.76 million ha while the actual area irrigated was only 0.21 million ha, roughly 25 per cent. According to the annual reports of the Narmada and Water Resources Department of the Gujarat government, this figure remained unchanged at 0.21 million ha in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. The Gujarat Dev- elopment Review of 2017-18, part of the state's annual budget document, projects that the actual area under irrigation from the Narmada project will increase to 0.33 million ha in 2017-18 and 2018-19. This means that only 18.42 per cent area would have been covered by the end of financial year 2019. www.downtoearth.org.in/governance Tankers are the main source of water for many households in Gujarat, like these women collecting their daily quota on the outskirts of Ahmedabad PHOTOGRAPHS: AMIT 11:01 AMANALYSISMehta cites a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (cag ) of India from 2009 to point out that \"very few areas are being irrigated by the ssp as against the network that has been completed because the government had not followed, what is called, the vertical integration approach. This is lack of planning and skewed priorities\". Vertical integration approach is to simultaneously construct the canal network along with the raising of the dam height and proportionally irrigating the fields. \"This has not been done and this would also pose the problem of flooding beyond a point,\" Mehta argues. Money matters Finances are also a major issue for the completion of the project's canal network. Against the original estimated cost of `6,000 crore, a cumulative expenditure of `56,286 crore was already incurred on it as on October 2016. According to a 2012 estimate by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (tiss), the project cost would be `72,000 crore. Sources claim it may not be less than `90,000 crore when all the canal work is done and water reaches the fields and homes of all the beneficiaries. In 2013, a cwc monitoring team had found problems with land acquisition to be the major roadblock to the canal works. The Gujarat government had later proposed some measures, including participatory irrigation management to overcome this. The registration of Water User's Associa- tions (wua s) was started under this prog- ramme but it still remains on paper. According to ssnnl, out of the total 4,552 Farmers in Gujarat use illegal means to get water for their irrigation needs as the promise of Narmada's water reaching their fields remains unfulfilled Unreachable water Incomplete canals | The SSP's record in status report, August 2017.Main canal River Branch canal District boundary Command area of SSPGulf of KhambhatGulf of Kachchh Narmada Dam 42 2017 40-46Analysis.indd 42 10/10/17 3:19 PMHimalaya goes green in the Western Ghats!

This is when the regions which were originally intended to receive ssp's water don't even have a canal network. The Supreme Court's major argument for allowing the construction of ssp's dam and later increasing its height was bringing water to the dry regions of Kutch, Sau- rashtra and North Gujarat. It had held in its ruling of October 18, 2000 that there was no other alternative for ending the water woes of these regions. However, Shah says, \"Though large parts of central Gujarat and some parts of north Gujarat (Banaskantha district) are enjoying the benefits of ssp water, there is still little or no irrigation from the project in Kutch.\" Looking at some districts in the regions provides a clearer picture about the status of canal works. Up to March 2016, in Botad district of Saurashtra region while the branch canal and half the distributaries had been completed, the sub-minor network stood at a meager six per cent. In Kutch, up to the same date, half the branch canal had been completed but the status of distributaries, minor and sub-minor canals all stood at zero. Perhaps to tackle this scenario, Saurashtra Narmada Avtaran Irrigation (sauni) project, worth `12,200 crore, was inaugurated by Narendra Modi as the Chief Minister in 2012. The Sujalam Sufalam Project was also started for North Gujarat and Kutch. The projects envisage diverting as much as 3 million acre feet ( maf) of Narmada floodwaters overflowing from the Sardar Sarovar or the Narmada dam to distribute equally to the three regions. Under sauni, water would be carried from the Narmada dam through a 1,125 sq km network of pipelines to fill up 115 major reservoirs in the Saurashtra region and through the existing network of these dams to irrigate 0.41 million ha of land. The deadline to finish this project is 2019. For Sujalam Sufalam, the work on filling up nine reservoirs in North Gujarat was taken up in 2014 and the government claims to have completed the work. A senior official explains that once these projects are completed, assuming that the overflow of floodwaters continues, the idea is to divert the \"spare waters\" to industries and residential areas in the urban centres in Gujarat.The water is in fact already being diverted to the industries. Official sources, requesting anonymity, have cited that an estimated 20 million litres a day ( mld) of water is being supplied to the Tata Nano, Ford and Suzuki projects in Sanand and Bechraji in North Gujarat, while a Coca Cola bottling plant has been committed 30 mld. In all, an allocation of 90 mld has been made for industries coming up in Sanand area, nearly 25 km from Ahmedabad. While industries enjoy the canal water, the people of the water deficient regions have taken to water thieving and increasingly depend on water tankers to meet their needs. \"For the last 15 to 20 years, we oft and on illegally drew water from the Narmada canal,\" Sankhavra is upfront in admitting. \"At most places the rough estimate is that 40 per cent of water is being drawn illegally from the main canal, where it is close,\" a top government official, requesting anonymity, says. Even in North Gujarat water is being pulled out at many places close to the main canal of the Narmada dam by illegal motors sunk into the main canal. Madhapar completely depends upon the 22 water tankers that visit the people twice a day. Expanding it further, the Rajkot taluka 's 0.2 million population in 96 villages get water from 170 tankers each of 5,000 to 10,000 litres capacity. Experts have believed for a long time The travesty is that while industries enjoy the benefits of the canal water, the people of the water deficient regions have taken to water thieving and depending on water tankers to meet their needsMany minor and sub-minor canals have been found to be damaged like this stretch near Patan, North Gujarat 44 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 OCTOBER 2017 40-46Analysis.indd 44 10/10/17 10:50 AMANKUSH BHATNAGAR | Chef BECAUSE, THE MAGAZINE REMINDS ME OF THE FOOD DIVERSITY OF INDIA AND MAKES THAT INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN ECOLOGY AND CULTURE www.downtoearth.org.inDownToEarth SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENT FORTNIGHTLY265,845 TIMES STORIES SHARED* 12 AWARDS529 DISTRICTS**>40,000 STORIES* *Number of stories published in both print and website; Stories shared in 2016 in social networking sites like Facebook. ** Number of disrticts Down To Earth is read in. 45DTE campaign_6.indd 45 11/10/17 11:43 AMANALYSIS that the real challenge in achieving the irrigation objective of large dams like ssp does not lie in the dam itself but developing an efficient and affordable distribution network. \"Distribution systems are a problem in all large irrigation systems in India and elsewhere in Asia,\" Shah says, ex-cluding China for its recent modernisation programme for irrigation systems. Groundwater conundrum It has been argued that better irrigation outcomes can be achieved by developing a hybrid distribution network through regular recharge of local storages and groundwater sources rather than increasing the height of the dam. An iwmi working paper from 2010 titled, \"A case for pipelining water distribution in the Narmada irrigation System in Gujarat, India\" argues fervently for a pipeline-based irrigation system as against a canal-based one. It lists a slew of advantages for this shift including cost cuts for the government, creation of irrigation cooperatives with farmer participation, creation of 150,000 to 200,000 rural jobs and conjunctive use of ground and surface water in water deficient areas. In Gujarat, farmers have already taken up the initiative to irrigate their lands with pipelines, even when they have to do so illegally. Pradhan Thakor of Kotharpura of Bechraji taluka in Mehsana district doesn't mince words when he says he draws from a pond which has Narmada waters. \"I spent I1.25 lakh three years ago to install a pump and a 2-km pipeline up to one of my fields to fetch water,\" he says. Such a scenario calls for a full-fledged farmer participation for ensuring irrigation by the government. In 2014, taking cue from water experts, cwc and perhaps illegal water lifting the gov-ernment of Gujarat started its own under-ground pipeline network for the sub-minor level. But it handed this job over to contractors, limiting farmer participation. cwc in 2015 noted: \"Work of sub-minors is in progress in 0.5 million ha of 12,452 km length as Under Ground Pipe Line (ugpl) with 10 per cent cost participation from farmers.\" According to an Indian Express report from December 2015, a review on ugpl by B N Navalawala, advisor to the Chief Minister on water, had criticised the move. It had said that this project will not be able to provide water to all villages because of conflicts arising out of the choking of pipelines from the upstream farmers. It also cited that silt deposition from the open canals from where the underground pipelines emerge will choke the pipelines downstream. Even this work is only 47 per cent complete, while private investments are being made to illegally draw from ugpl with the use of privately installed pipelines. The nature of agriculture and irrigation in Gujarat has also changed since the ssp was first envisaged. Shah says, \"Gujarat is growing its dairy and high-value farming. These need frequent irrigation that canals are unable to provide.\" According to the State of Indian Agriculture 2015-16 report, Gujarat grows the highest share of spices in India at 18 per cent. This includes black pepper, chillies, ginger, turmeric, garlic, and cardamom. The share of Gujarat's fruit production among Indian states is at 9.27 per cent, which is the fourth-highest in India. Gujarat is fifth in vegetable production as well. All these crops require an on-demand irrigation mechanism which is not possible in the case of canal-based irrigation systems. The production of all these crops in Gujarat has increased four times between 2000 and 2015. This is why farmers are attracted to the on-demand water supply from tube-wells and pumping water from canal commands and distributing it through underground pipelines. But groundwater is also not an inexhaustible resource. In many regions which are solely dependent on groundwater for their agricultural purposes, groundwater levels have fallen drastically. Development Support Centre, a non-profit in Ahmedabad, and Western Sydney University conducted a pilot study which found that extraction of groundwater in many of the villages in North Gujarat is no more viable. Similarly farmers working with non- profits and local administrations have shown great resolve in building check dams and de-silting old reservoirs and tanks to recharge aquifers. Shah praises Gujarat as it \"has pioneered the management of aquifer storage and recovery in small holder setting\". There is a case for replicating such initiatives in water deficient areas. Recharge of aquifers in water deficient regions can be carried out by spreading ssp's water over them. For this Shah suggests to \"expand the distribution system, ensure water reaches tail ends and promote conjunctive use of surface and groundwater.\" In the changed context of agriculture in Gujarat, if farmers like Sankhavra's dreams are to be fulfilled the government needs to work closely with farmers, aiding their initiatives rather than splurge on an inefficient canal network. n @down2earthindia In spite of protests like the \u00aa Rally for the Valley 2017\u00ba in Madhya Pradesh, the intended beneficiaries are yet to get water from the Narmada canalNARMADA BACHAO ABHIYAAN 46 10/10/17 11:01 AMJan 15, 2011 Down To Earth PB65 JAN 1-15 2016 Biodiversity conservation by Srinivasan Services Trust, The CSR arm of TVS Motor Company Results 4,20,185 (66%) households solid waste disposed through either individual or common compost pits. 16,375 Ha covered under soil and water conservation. 17,315 Ha fallow dry land converted to cultivable area. 1,75,250 Ha of degraded forest has been reforested.

Plunging down at a speed close to 125,000 km/hr, the spacecraft burned up and became one with the big planet. Almost 20 years ago on October 15, 1997, scientists from nasa, esa and the Italian Space Agency, together embarked on a mission to study Saturn, the farthest planet visible to the naked eye in our solar system. It was the farthest humans had ever inserted a probe into the solar system. Until then, scientists had only managed glimpses captured by nasa's Voyager spacecrafts on their way to the outer solar system. The Cassini mission, named after the 17 th century Italian astro- nomer Giovanni Cassini who had disco-vered the divisions in Saturn's rings and four of its moons, was planned to orbit Saturn and study in close detail its rings and the condi- tion of its many moons. To give you an idea of how much has changed in our understanding of the planet in the last two decades consider this\u2014when Cassini was launched, fewer than 20 of the 62 currently known moons of Saturn had been discovered. Cassini will undoubtedly remain etched in memory for the more than 450,000 photographs that it beamed back in its lifetime allowing humanity a closer glimpse at the surrealism of our cosmos. But the probe also carried 12 high-tech instruments including spectrometers, spectrographs, magnetometers and dust analysers which have helped almost completely overhaul scientists' understanding of the sixth planet in our solar system. Arriving at Saturn's doorstep in 2004 Cassini showed us the famed rings of Saturn in mesmerising detail, revealing for the first time that the bands in fact ran into millions in number rather than the thousands estimated by scientists then. Over the years, Cassini gave us a window, constantly supplying information into how these rings were diverse, dynamically changing and reacting; acting much like Saturn's own mini solar system. The proximity offered by Cassini allowed scientists to learn about formative processes in ever closer detail\u2014how objects clump together or break apart. Ripples in rings offered scientists a line of sight into the history of impacts and \"propeller\" features which show similarities to the processes of planetary formation. The hope is that this shall make way for insights into the way galaxies and solar systems are formed. In its 13 years orbiting Saturn, the bus- sized probe examined 19 of its moons and revealed an astonishing variety ranging from the massive, hazy Titan to the pockmarked SCIENCE Cassini dives into Saturn The Cassini-Huygens probe has enabled scientists analyse the surface and atmosphere of some of Saturn's mysterious moons SHREESHAN VENKATESH ASTRONOMY www.downtoearth.org.in/science-and-technology With this view, Cassini captured one of its last looks at Saturn and its main rings from a distanceNASA 48-49Science.indd 48 09/10/17 3:21 PMwww.downtoearth.org.in 49 16-31 OCTOBER 2017sponge-like Hyperion. Perhaps one of the biggest mysteries solved by Cassini is the case of Saturn's dual-toned moon Lapetus. Observations showed that Lapetus's \u00aayin- yang\u00ba appearance was owing to the depo- sition of fine dark dust by another of Saturn's moons\u2014Phoebe (which is believed to be an object from the fringes of the solar system captured by Saturn's gravitation long ago). In 2010, the probe watched closely as a storm formed on the surface of Saturn. Over the course of several months, the storm stretched over 0.3 million km with no landmass to intervene and halt the progress. The storm was ultimately stopped in its tracks by its own tail. As the search for extraterrestrial life rumbles on, Cassini's observations from two moons, Titan and Enceladus, have captured astro-scientists' imagination. Titan was one of the primary targets of the mission when it was planned. Little was known about Saturn's biggest moon at the time beyond the fact that it possessed an atmosphere. In December 2004, the Cassini spacecraft launched the Huygens lander (a European probe piggy-backing on the Cassini) onto the surface of Titan. It landed on the surface in January 2005. In the 72 minutes that the Huygens continued to beam information after landing, Titan's surface was found to be incredibly earth-like; complete with rocks and geological features like mountains and canyons carved by liquid methane. Cassini, using infrared cameras, showed a carbon-rich landscape full of dunes and mounds sculpted by winds. Through over 127 fly-bys, Cassini watched on as Titan's meteorological cycles played out. Feathery methane clouds formed, floated and erupted in liquid methane precipitation much like our own hydro- logical cycle on earth. In fact, the climatic cycles on Titan have been likened to a possible analog for future earth. Cassini found organic molecules known to be pre- cursors of complex organic molecules which form the building blocks of life in the upper atmosphere of the moon. Scientists believe that Titan might provide the best stage to study organic chemistry that evolved into life on earth some 8 billion years ago. When the mission was kicked off, scientists assumed that Enceladus was too small to generate and retain heat for the existence of liquid water. Enceladus was assumed to be an icy, dead moon. In 2006, after studying high resolution images, scientists announced the evidence of the possibility of water geysers spewing liquid water on Enceladus. In the years that followed, the Cassini mission revealed intense geologic activity near the moon's unexpectedly warm south pole, the presence of a subsurface ocean complete with salts, simple organic molecules and possibly even hydrothermal vents, much like we have on earth. From an icy, dead satellite, the 500 km-wide moon is now considered to be one of the most promising places in our solar system for extraterrestrial life. In 2010, it was decided that the mission would be extended a second time, this time until fuel ran out. And so even in its final descent, the Cassini probe manoeuvred between Saturn and its rings 22 times before taking the ultimate \"bittersweet\" death dive with about 1 per cent of fuel remaining. The entire mission that lasted for two decades involved three space agencies, hardware from 19 and investigations from 26 nations. Around 80 minutes after its final signals flickered to death on screen, Cassini's final message to earth reached its destination\u2014 an image of the mystical dual-tone Lapetus. The Cassini-Huygens mission wasn't just one-of-its-kind scientifically speaking, it was also a testament to the distance humanity can traverse with scientific cooperation\u2014perhaps a timely reminder for an increasingly-isolated world.

The huge number of legal challenges filed by rival companies, leave aside those instituted by public health organisations, is proof of how vexatious many of the claims are. This becomes more contentious when drug makers try to extend the patent term \u2014this is usu- ally for 20 years \u2014by making incremental tweaks to the original formula. Such stratagems are par for the course. Allergan, a Dublin-based drug multinational, opted for an unprecedented and certainly creative method to protect some of its most prized patents: it handed them over to a Native American tribe for safe-keeping! And how does that work? It all revolves around the concept of \u00aasovereign immunity \u00ba. As the term implies, sovereign im - munity is based on the concept\u2014 its roots lie in England\u2014 that one can- not sue a monarch in a court of law. This concept is codified in the US Constitution which initially barred any prosecution of the states that make up the US of America. The im - munity was later extended to Native American tribes and to state-owned universities. Such institutions and groups cannot be taken to court and can use their sover - eign rights to enter into settlements, such as patent deals. Voila! It is the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in north - ern New York state which now owns a clutch of patents on Allergan's top-selling Restasis, a medication to treat dry eye condition. Restasis provides annual inflows of $ 1.5 billion, or 10 per cent of Allergan's 2016 revenue and the company came up with this novel solution to protect Restasis patents which are being challenged by Mylan and Teva. These companies say the patents which were scheduled to expire in 2014 were extended by tweaking the original product and are now valid till 2024. India debars such incremental changes to the original patent claim under the famous Section 3d of the patent law. While Mylan and Teva were preparing to launch ge- neric versions of this blockbuster drug in 2013, Allergen secured a patent extension through claims which the ge - neric firms say are novel but cover merely the exact con - centrations of active and inactive ingredients used in the new product. Their challenge was filed in 2016 at the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board ( ptab). In September, Allergan dropped a bombshell by announcing that it had transferred six patents cover - ing Restasis to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in Northern New York. The deal involves an upfront payment of $13.75 million and an annual royalty of $15 million for as long as the patents are valid. It is a windfall for the tribe but is a mere trifle for Allergan. The imme - diate fallout is a filing by the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe at ptab for dis- missal of Mylan's suit on the ground that the board as an administrative court has no jurisdiction over the Mohawks\u2014 unless the US Congress repeals its immunity. Mylan's lawyers have, predicta- bly, called Allergen's move a \"sham transaction,\" because the tribe did not purchase the patents but were instead paid to take them. There is outrage among the lawmakers, too. One senator has de - scribed it as \"the most brazen and absurd loopholes I've ever seen, and it should be illegal\". There is a related issue here. The Allergan case is be - ing heard at the ptab in a process called \"inter partes re - view\" which has helped settle patent disputes in a sim - pler and less expensive than in the courts. If the hearing is blocked, it could deter generic-drug makers from chal - lenging the patents for some expensive drugs. Meanwhile, a number of tribes are reported to have hired lawyers to say they are in the market for patents \u2014 not to buy them obviously but to be given the rights for a fee, of course.

Should India be worried? RAJAT GHAI | new delhiFOR SURENDRA Singh Rajpurohit, horses are a passion as well as a source of livelihood. \"I belong to a Rajput family that has been breeding horses for quite some time,\" says the resident of Patan town in Rajasthan's Ajmer district. He is in mourning as one of his best animals died recently. \"Almost three years ago, I bought a 3-month-old milk-white Marwari colt from Shahpura village in Jaipur district for `50,000. I named him Badal. I looked after him like he was my son. I used to give him 7 litres of milk daily besides his feed. I even gave him almonds and resins,\" Rajpurohit says. \"He was my pride. At the Pushkar fair during last Diwali buyers were prepared to give `700,000 for him.\" Rajpurohit did not sell Badal then and in May this year tragedy struck. Badal developed mysterious lesions on his body. \"It was like insect bites. The wounds continued to recur. I took him to the government veterinary hospital in Ajmer. But it was of no help. Then I sent his blood for testing to the Indian Council for Agricul- tural Research-National Hisar, Haryana. We waited But on August 1, Badal died,\" Rajpurohit says. \"Other than the emotional loss, there was the monetary part. I had spent `1 lakh for breaking him (training a horse to carry a rider or pull freight). I was planning to sell him this Diwali. He would have fetched more this time. But my fate had something else in store for me,\" says Rajpurohit. The recent outbreak What Rajpurohit does not know is that Badal had fallen prey to glanders. A highly infectious and often fatal zoonotic disease, glanders is caused by 09/10/17 horses, donkeys, po - nies, and mules. It was a worldwide problem for equines for centuries. But by 1900s it had been eradicated from Europe, North Am- erica and Australia. But in the developing world, including India, it is still rife. \"Although it is a very old disease, the latest outbreak happened in 2006,\" says Bhupendra Nath Tripathi, reported from a number of states. However, by 2014, it was being reported mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh,\" he adds. But in the last three years, glanders has spread to nine states. In 2017, from April 1 to August 31, it has been confirmed in Har- yana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh. There are a total of 185 positive cases in these five months. Contrast that with 2016-2017, when the count for the whole year was 143 cases. H K Muniyellappa, Joint Commissioner (Livestock Health) at the Union Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare's Depart-ment of Animal Husbandry, says, \"It is not that the disease is increasing. It is just that the government's surveillance prog-ramme has been strengthened.\" To some extent, with Muniyellappa. \"The catchword here is Uttar Pradesh,\" he says. Out of the 185 cases repor- ted this year, 127 are from UP, which, accor- ding to the latest National Livestock Census released in 2012, had 0.2 million horses, ponies, mules, and donkeys. UP has been warned not to hold animal fairs in winter to prevent the spread of glanders. \"Earlier, we thought the disease was restricted to west-ern UP. But then we changed our percep- tion. When we alerted the government, they initiated a project under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana to help UP's 75 districts to send equine blood serum samples to us. Now, we are getting 2,000 samples every month,\" says Tripathi. \"Equines from UP are sent to various parts of the country after being bought and sold at animal fairs. The disease follows them,\" Tripathi says. Indeed, the threat of glanders infecting equines in animal fairs is very likely (See `With political commitment, glanders can be eradicated in India '). Animal rights activist Gauri Maulekhi agrees. \"We are in the grip of an epidemic because we have very poor diagnostics and a highly migratory equine population that is travelling between the states. Moreover, equines in India are used mostly by the poorest of the poor. Most of these owners don't even know the procedure for sur-veillance of their animals and for getting them tested if there are symptoms.\" Talking about compensation Tripathi says, \"As per the British Era Glanders and Farcy Act, 1899, the compensation was a mere `50 per animal. This continued till 2009, when after demands by icar- nrce, non-profits and race clubs, the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009 was promulgated. It has now been increased to `25,000 per horse and `16,000 per mule/ donkey.\" However, Rajpurohit tells Down To Earth that despite repeated attempts he has not got any compensation. Lack of policy \"We still lack a full-fledged national policy for glanders. The usual procedure is that af- ter icar- nrce has confirmed glanders, the state government notifies it and the Depart- ment of Animal Husbandry culls the infec- ted animals. But we need a policy for the en- tire country, where there is monitoring and surveillance. The movement of animals in endemic areas should be restricted. Why is it that despite having only 1.2 million horses nationwide, we have not been able to era-dicate the disease?\" says Tripathi. The spread of glanders shows the neg- lect of veterinary science in India. \"We had a culture of using a lot of horses, don-keys and mules for a variety of purposes. But now, it is an unviable and uneconomical activity with a huge ecological impact. Why can't they be phased out?\" asks Maulekhi. As far as the neglect of veterinary science goes, she is even more scathing. \"Our veterinary coll-ege syllabus was revived after 40 years last year. The quality of veterinarians being pro- duced in India is very low. We need to up- grade that by updating syllabi, inviting fore- ign faculties and increasing the number of research centres and laboratories.\" What is the threat from glanders during animal fairs? It is a big problem. We recently asked the UP government to not hold any animal fairs from October to March. Although it is hard on the animal owners, we feel it should be done at least once to create awareness. Unfortunately the government is doing nothing in this regard. Are there any vaccines for glanders? Not many advances have been made in this regard as the glanders pathogen is very dangerous to handle. Humans researching for a possible cure can also get infected, resulting in fatalities. The last human case was detected in 2000 at a defence laboratory in the US. Glanders is a weapon of bio-terrorism. It was used during the two World Wars. It was also used by the Soviets during the Soviet-Afghan War that lasted from 1979 to 1989. Can India eliminate glanders like North America, Europe and Australia have done?Yes. We have the technology and competence. But we need political commitment and funds. We need a budget of at least `2 crore for more research and raising awareness.`With political commitment, glanders can be eradicated in India ' BHUPENDRA NATH TRIPATHI, Director of the Hisar-based icar-nrce talks to Down To Earth about the outbreak of glanders in India 16-31 OCTOBER 2017 52-53Wildlife.indd 53 09/10/17 3:22 PMREVIEW Emotional construct LISA FELDMAN Barrett, a psychology professor at Boston's Northeastern University, begins How Emotions Are Made , with a discussion on a 2,000-year-old assumption: all human beings have a given set of common emotions hardwired into their genetic codes. When triggered, these emotions come to the surface quickly and reflexively, and are recognised as such by a vast majority of people\u2014irrespective of their nationality, culture, gender or age. This is what is known as the \u00aaClassical Theory of Emotions\u00ba , which says that emotions have been refined and handed down through evolution to successive generations of human beings. Barrett's goal is simple. She aims to prove the 2,000-year-old assumption wrong. She starts with a summary of the fundamental tenets of the classical theory, namely that the basic set of emotions are artefacts of evolution; they are fixed and universal; and, that each emotion has a defining underlying pattern in the brain with corresponding physiological changes in the body. Through examples and exercises, Barrett shows the pervasiveness of this faulty view in almost all aspects of our lives. As she says, it is embedded in our popular culture through television shows like Daredevil; in medicinal science, it manifests itself as women being hurriedly\u2014and often incorrectly\u2014diagnosed with ailments that are not present (most common being anxiety); and, in the market place, we have companies that offer consultancy to businesses to determine their customers' emotional engagement with their product. The classical view also affects the decisions taken by law enforcement agencies, the functioning of legal systems, and not to forget, the place it holds in various streams of philosophy and religion. \"Emotions are thus thought to be a kind of brute reflex, very often at odds with our rationality... This kind of internal battle between emotion and reason is one of the great narratives of the www.downtoearth.org.in/reviews TARIQUE AZIZ / CSE HOW EMOTIONS ARE MADE: THE SECRET LIFE OF THE BRAINLisa Feldman Barrett Houghton Mifflin | 425 pages | `986Contrary to popular belief, emotions are not universal, but based on culture and environment ANANT MISRA 54 DOWN TO EARTH 54-55Review.indd 54 09/10/17 4:25 PMWestern civilisation,\" she writes. Pointing out the deficiencies and contradictions present in the classical theory, the book offers an alternative: \u00aaTheory of Constructed Emotions\u00ba . In this theory, emotions do not follow a fixed pattern either in the brain or in the body. They are not universal, but are based on culture and environment, and most importantly, they are not \"built-in\" to be triggered by external factors. Rather, they are created or constructed by the brain to make sense of the sensory inputs it receives from the body. While this might seem counterintuitive at first, the author does an excellent job of building a case for this through simple exercises for readers, as well as by detailing complex experiments that support her hypothesis. While the classical view hinges on uniformity and universality, the \u00aaTheory of Constructed Emotions\u00ba emphasises individual as well as cultural variations. Consider this relatable example of the various ways in which one can experience fear: \"While cowering in your seat at a horror movie, you might close your eyes or cover them with your hands. If you're uncertain whether a person directly in front of you could harm you, you might narrow your eyes to see the person's face better. If danger is potentially lurking around the next corner, your eyes might widen to improve your peripheral vision. 'Fear' takes no single form. Variation is the norm.\" The book can be broadly divided in two parts. The first part discusses the shortcomings in the classical view, while introducing and building the alternate viewpoint of emotions being cons-tructed. This is done via a historical reassessment of the erroneous methodology that supported the classical view as well as by discussing the new experiments which offer evidence in favour of the \u00aaTheory of Constructed Emotions\u00ba . The second part looks to apply the theory to practice in medicine, law and even the emotional capacities of animals. Keeping in mind that the intended readership for this book is not the academic community but common readers, Barrett discusses concepts such as \"introception\", \"prediction loop\", and \"body-budget\" to develop a better understanding of how the complicated interplay between the brain and sensory inputs constructs emotions in people. Given the nature of the topic and the fact that any meaningful discussion must bring together disciplines like neuroscience, psychology, and biology, the writing at times gets a little laboured and repetitive. However, what keeps the reader going is the constant engagement that the author offers by way of visual puzzles and the linkages she provides between theory and events that happen in everyday life. The fascinating parts of the book are those that deal with how rudimentary emotional concepts get formed in infants and how the knowledge of an emotion (through language) can actually enhance one's experience of it. This, however, might also be the most con-tentious aspect of the work\u2014the feasibility of improving personal health by learning and unlearning emotional concepts needs to be measured by way of experiments designed for this very purpose. At its core, Barrett's argument shifts the onus of an individual's behaviour and well-being to the individual self. \"Emotions are not temporary deviations from rationality. They are not alien forces that invade you without your consent... Instances of emotion are no more out of control than thoughts or perceptions or beliefs or memories.\" This is at once a liberating thought as well as a sobering one. (The author is a freelance writer)AUTHOR SAYS LISA FELDMAN BARRETT speaks to Down To Earth What could be the impact of your \u00aaTheory of Constructed Emotions\u00ba on related disciplines? The book deliberately integrates psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy (as well as a bit of biology and anthropology) to understand how emotions are made \u2014it is a multidisciplinary approach. I use the science of emotion as a lens to explore some of the unanswered questions about what it means to be human, including consciousness, knowledge formation, responsibility and our relationship to other animals. Does your theory throw light on how we form bonds? Yes. An infant brain is not a miniature adult brain \u2014it is a brain waiting for wiring instructions from the world, including caregivers. An infant depends on caregivers to balance her body budget, and this sets up the conditions for bonding (and also for knowledge formation). What explains the rise of physiological changes when one receives the news of the loss of a family member as against the relative detachment with which one can process the death of an acquaintance?Humans are social animals. We regulate each other's nervous systems. Often without knowing it, we assist one another with the necessary body budget regulation to meet the changing demands of life. A close family member or someone you are bonded with is a person who helps to regulate your nervous system as you help to regulate theirs. When you lose that person, it feels as if you are losing a part of yourself. This is not true when you learn about the death of someone who plays less of a role in your body budget management. You have authored academic books and peer- reviewed articles. What made you reach out to readers outside the academia?People are being harmed when physicians, policymakers and the law use a classical view of emotion. Opportun-ities in parenting, education and industry are being missed. Understanding how emotions are made \u2014as a way of understanding how your brain functions in the context of the brains of other people around you, as well as a means to understanding how science works \u2014can be a game changer. Knowledge is power.Human beings regulate each other's 55 09/10/17 3:22 PMOPINION MILK A TALE OF TWO SPECIES INDIA IS the world's largest milk producer, accounting for 18.5 per cent of world production. In the past six and a half decades milk production in India has grown by over eightfold, from 17 million tonnes in 1950 to 137.7 million tonnes in 2013. To ensure the sustainability of this success it is necessary to analyse the factors responsible for it. Over 95 per cent of India's milk production comes from two species namely cattle and buffalo. The Indian indigenous varieties of cows ( desi cows) are known to have less milking potential than exotic cows like Jersey or Holstein Friesian. However, the exotic breeds are unable to cope with the Indian climate, diseases and other conditions. Recognising this, the govern - ment promoted a systematic cross breeding programme. The cross- breeds are known to have milk yields substantially higher than the desi cows and are also much more resilient than the exotic pure breeds. Although Artificial Insemination (AI) was first per - formed in India in 1939, it was intensified in the third phase of Operation Flood starting in 1985. Operation Flood was started by National Dairy Dev- elopment Board (nddb) in the 1970s. The objective of this programme was to create a nation-wide milk grid. The bed - rock of Operation Flood has been village milk producers' cooperatives, which procure milk and provide inputs and services, making modern management and technology available to members. Unique to cows was the AI programme with exotic semen. As a strategy to increase milk yield cross - breeding with exotic cows like Jersey, Holstein Friesian was aggressive -India's milk boom would have remained the same if systematic selective breeding was introduced from the 1960s OJAS S V, ALOK BANG AND MILIND WATVE The Kankreji breed of indigenous cattle originates in the desert regions of Northwest India 16-31 OCTOBER 2017 56-57Opinion.indd 56 10/10/17 3:20 PMly promoted. The breed improvement drive was so aggressive that in states like Kerala, mandatory castration of desi bulls was an enforced law. Exotic/crossbred cattle are considered to have more advantages over desi breeds considering more milk yield per day and more milk yield in one lactation phase. The average milk yield per milking female is substantially different in the two, an average estimate being 2.46 for indige - nous versus 7.4 litres for the crossbred. So although the proportion of crossbred cows is only 21 per cent their total share in cow's milk is 59.15 per cent. From 1950s to 2012 cattle population increased by 1.22 folds whereas buffalo population increased by 2.5 folds. This increase in the buffalo population doesn't completely justify eight folds rise in buffalo milk production. The per-animal productivity in buf-falo has also gone up substantially. In 1950, each milking buffalo would yield estimated 1.54 litres milk per day which increased to 4.50 litres per animal per day in 2012 constituting about 2.9 folds increase. This was contributed by better breeds, better nutrition, better veterinary care, nutritional and hormonal facilitators of pro - ductivity and better population management because of which the proportion of females in the total population has gone up signif - icantly. The net success with buffalo milk is of the same order as that of cow's milk although there was no AI with exotic germplasm. Ninety per cent of desi cattle population and 69 per cent of buf - falo population are under extensive feeding system, where animals are let out for grazing. The keeper has hardly any control over the diet composition of the animals. Entire of exotic/crossbred cattle population is under intensive feeding system which consists of stall feeding in which the keeper has control over the diet composition. When desi cows are provided equally careful nutrition, their yield improves substantially although still not as much as the AI cross - breed. In 2012, milk production by desi cows was 26.695 million tonnes (21.68 per cent) of the total; that by exotic cattle was 38.657 million tonnes (31.39 per cent) and that by buffalo was 57.77 million tonnes (46.97 per cent). How much of the milk revolution is because of the exotic germplasm? In or- der to give a fair answer we will have to as- sume that the number of cattle would have been the same, i.e. all of the current crossbreeds were replaced by desi cattle. Since the yield of desi cat- tle under intensive feeding conditions is about one-third of the crossbreeds, instead of 38.66 million tonnes ob- tained from the crossbreeds today we would have obtained about 13 million tonnes. This amounts to about 20 per cent reduction in the total bo-vine milk yield. So if the exotics were not in-troduced but the other components of Operation Flood remained unchanged, India's net milk productivity would have increased by 6.4 folds instead of 8 folds. Is it possible that the money spent on the AI programme or equal amount spent on im - provement and selective propagation of lo - cal breeds would have given more or less the same result? All domesticated animals are un- der human made selection irrespective of whether there are organised breeding programmes or not. It is common to see that in the traditional caste dominated Indian system, different caste communi - ties have reared different varieties of animals and used different criteria for selection. Moreover the economics of traditional cat - tle keeping is driven by ratio optimisation rather than difference optimisation. When one tried to optimise the benefit to cost-ratio, bringing the denominator close to zero is sufficient to maximise the ratio. Minimum maintenance requirement has been a major selec - tion criterion. High milk yield was never a major selection criteri- on for cattle breeding in India. Animal populations are known to respond to selection within a few generations and in cattle breed - ing programmes three to five years is an effective generation time. Therefore if systematic selective breeding programmes were un - dertaken from the 1960s, 60 years could have been sufficient for the required 20 per cent increase in the average. It can be argued that the boom in India's milk production could have remained the same even if no exotic breeds were introduced. The changing infra - structure and services and the changing economics appear to have contributed to the milk revolution more than the genetic import. This realisation is necessary to plan the future of the success story.

Since the yield of desi cat desi cat desi - tle under intensive feeding conditions is about one-third of the crossbreeds, instead of 38.66 million tonnes ob - tained from the crossbreeds today we would have obtained about 13 million tonnes. This amounts to about 20 per cent reduction in the total bo - vine milk yield. So if the exotics were not in - troduced but the other components of Operation Flood remained unchanged, India's net milk productivity would have Maharashtra's Gene Bank Program A Jersey- Holstein cow, bred from two European breeds of cattle imported to India in the 1970s 16-31 OCTOBER 2017 56-57Opinion.indd 57 09/10/17 4:26 PMLAST WORD IT IS that time of the year again. A time when the peo - ple of India observe a string of festivals, culminating in Diwali and Christmas at the year-end. The media has a name for it: the festive season. Though I am not against Indians celebrating any religious festival, I do take offence to the manner in which they do that, caus - ing irreparable damage to the environment. Festivals initially were meant to celebrate life itself, to thank the Creator for the gifts bestowed during the year. However, all that changed when religions began to be - come organised and institutionalised more than 2,000 years ago. And in the modern era, where consumerism has joined forces with organised religion, the result is there for everybody to see: pandals hosting idols that are immersed in water bodies which then become contam-inated. The residents of every mo- halla in the city want to prove that their pandal has the most grand idol and can attract the most celebrities. Unfortunately, such grandstanding comes at a terrible cost. I would say that the so-called Indian faiths cause a lot of environ-mental pollution (with Hinduism leading the pack), although I am not absolving the Abrahamic reli- gions completely. However, I would not include the religious beliefs of India's tribals and forest-dwell-ing communities in this category. That is because their beliefs are not organised. They love the trees and groves. They don't have temples, mosques and churches. Their festival observances are very sim - ple, something that we, the so-called civilised masses, should learn from. And this is something common to in - digenous peoples across the world. How can one forget that immortal letter of Seattle, Chief of the Suquamish Nation, after whom the city of Seattle in the US state of Washington is named? In that letter, written purported- ly around 1855 to the then US President Franklin Pierce, Chief Seattle argues against selling his tribe's land to the US government. He says, \"You may be ready to buy, but we cannot sell. We cannot sell the earth, the fragrance of the flowers, the humming of the bees.\" That is the hall -mark of a truly great culture. Of course, there do exist religious leaders today who care for the environment. Take Pope Francis I for in - stance. In his encyclical, \"Laudato Si\" published on May 24, 2015, the Pope talks extensively on ecology and espe- cially, climate change. When I went through the docu-ment, I was ecstatic. Here was a Pope who was standing for a completely new paradigm of development. A doc - ument like Laudato Si is the need of the hour. I would rather that leaders of every religion, including those in our part of the world, read it and imbibe some of the val - ues, which are universal in nature and do not deal with Christianity or Catholicism exclusively. My own personal philosophy towards religion and the environment can best be explained by the follow - ing anecdote. Some years ago, when the Jyllands-Posten controversy re-garding cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad broke out, I was invited by the government of Iran to a con - ference of religious leaders at the city of Isfahan. When it was my turn, I condemned the cartoons. But then, I asked a very bold question to the people assembled: \"You are outraged because someone drew a caricature of the Prophet. But why are you not outraged when someone caricatures Allah?\" Those assembled asked me a counter-question: \"How could any- one caricature Allah?\" I replied when we pollute the clean air and water created by Allah, we caricature Him. To this, I added another stunner. The first Kalimah (Islamic creed) says La Illaha Illallah, Muhammad ur Rasulullah (God is one and Muhammad is His Messanger). I said I have a personal Kalimah of my own. It goes as La Illaha Illallah, Zarra Zarra Rasulullah (God is one and every particle of the Universe is the Messenger). In short, we should hold everything in this Universe as sacred, not as something to be toyed with but as something from the Divine. The leader of the Ayatollahs gathered there hugged me on the spot.
