FNS strongly encourage s applicants to begin the registration process at least four weeks before the due date. In order to submit an application, you must: 1. Obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) What is a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI)? A Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) is a unique number assigned to all entities (public and private companies, individuals, institutions, or organizations) who register to do business with the federal government. (U.S. General Services Administration ) What is the difference between a \"DUNS UEI\" and a \"SAM UEI\" in the System for Award Management ( SAM.gov )? \"DUNS UEI\" refers to your current 9 -digit Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number issued by Dun and Bradstreet . \"SAM UEI \" refers to your new 12 -character unique entity identifier that will be assigned by SAM.gov. Which UEI should I enter into the UEI field on the Grants.gov website and mobile app? Grants.gov encourages applicants to use their \" SAM UEI \" after they have been assigned one. Grants.gov also accepts applicants' \"DUNS UEI\", provided the \"DUNS UEI\" is available in SAM. Which UEI should I enter into application package forms? If the field label reads \"DUNS\", enter your \"DUNS UEI\". If the field label reads \"UEI\", enter your \"SAM UEI\". Where do I go to learn more about the UEI? The U.S. General Services Administration Unique Entity Identifier Update page contains the most up- to-date information about the UEI. NOTE: On and after April 4, 2022, entities can register in SAM.gov and will be assigned their Unique Entity ID (SAM) within SAM.gov. They will no longer obtain or use a UEI (DUNS) for entity registration or reporting. For additional information on the UEI process, please visit: SAM.gov | Duns - Sam UEI . 2. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) SAM combines Federal procurement systems and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance into one system. For additional information regarding SAM.gov, see the following link: https://sam.gov/content/home To register, you must have your organization's UEI (DUNS), entity's Tax ID Number (TIN), and taxpayer name (as it appears on last tax return). It may take up to 5 - 7 business days or more to register and/or complete the migration of 17 permissions and/or the renewal of an entity record. All applicants must have current SAM status at the time of application submission and throughout the duration of a Federal Award in accordance with 2 CFR Part 25. We strongly encourage applicants to begin the process at least 3 weeks before the due date of the grant solicitation. 3. Create a Grants.gov Account How to Register a Grants.gov Account 1.

To track your role request, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/track -role-status.html Electronic Signature : When applications are submitted through Grants.gov, the name of the organization's AOR that submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the electronic signature. The EBiz POC must authorize individuals who are able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of the organization as an AOR; this step is often missed and it is crucial for valid and timely submissions. How t o Submit an Application via Grants. gov Grants.gov applicants can apply online using Workspace. Workspace is a shared, online environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different web forms within an application. For each funding opportunity announcement (FOA) or RFA, you can create individual instances of a workspace. 19 For additional training resources, including video tutorials, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/apply- for-grants.html . Applicant Support : toll-free number 1-800- 518-4726 and email at support@grants.gov . If you are experiencing difficulties with your submission, it is best to call the Grants.gov Support Center and get a ticket number. The Support Center ticket number will assist the Center with tracking your issue and understanding background information on the issue. For questions related to the specific grant opportunity, please contact the Grant Officer noted in the Section VII \"Federal Awarding Agency Contact.\" Grants. gov Receipt Requirements and Proof of Timely Submission All applications must be received by 11:59 PM EST on the due date listed on the cover page. Proof of timely submission is automatically recorded by Grants.gov. An electronic date/time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by Grants.gov. The applicant AOR will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and a tracking number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) from Grants.gov with the successful transmission of their application. Applicant AORs will also receive the official date/time stamp and Grants.gov Tracking number in an email serving as proof of their timely s ubmission. When FNS successfully retrieves the application from Grants.gov and acknowledges the download of submissions, Grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the application to the email address of the applicant with the AOR role. Again, proof of timely submission shall be the official date and time that Grants.gov receives your application. Applications received by Grants.gov after the established due date for the program will be considered late and will not be considered for FNS funding. Applicants using slow internet, such as dial -up connections, should be aware that transmission could take some time before Grants.gov receives your application. Again, Grants.gov will provide either an error or a successfully received transmission in the form of an email sent to the applicant with the AOR role. The Grants.gov Support Center reports that some applicants end the transmission because they think that nothing is occurring during the transmission process. Please be patient and give the system time to process the application. Additional Information on Grants.gov and the Registration Process: NOTICE: Special Characters and Naming Conventions All applicants MUST follow Grants.gov guidance on file naming conventions. To avoid submission issues, please follow the guidance provided by Grants.gov per the Grants.gov Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Are there restrictions on file names for any attachment I include with my application package? File attachment names longer than approximately 50 characters can cause problems processing packages. Please limit file attachment names. Also, do not use any special characters (examples: 20 & - * % / # ' -). This includes periods (.) and spacing followed by a dash in the file. To separate words in naming a file, use underscore, as in the following example: Attached_File.pdf. Please note that if these guidelines are not followed, your application will be rejected. FNS will not accept any application rejected from www.grants.gov portal due to incorrect naming conventions. Additional informa tion and applicant resources are available at: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/workspace-overview.html . V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION EVALUATION OF GRANT APPLICATION CRITERIA Review Criteria FNS will pre -screen all applications to ensure the applicants are eligible entities and are in compliance with all Program regulations. FNS will not approve any waivers from Program regulations for any projects submitted in response to this solicitation. If an application does not include all appropriate information (proposal narrative, budget narrative, required forms/letters), FNS will consider the application to be non- responsive and will elimina te it from further evaluation. Evaluation Factors and Criteria All complete applications will be reviewed competitively and scored against the criteria listed in Section IV \"Application and Submission Information,\" including: Project design (35 points) Organizational experience, staff capability, and management (15 points) Project evaluation (20 points) Budget and economic efficiency (30 points) Bonus points (up to 6 points) Review and Selection Process Following the initial screening process, FNS will assemble a panel group to review and determine the technical merits of each application. The panel will evaluate the proposals based on how well they address the required application components and array the applications from highest to lowest score. The panel members will recommend applications for consideration for a grant award based on the evaluation scoring. The Selecting Official reserves the right to accept the panel's recommendation or to select an application for funding out of order to meet agency priorities, balance of eligible entities, geographical representation, or project diversity. FNS reserves the right to use this RFA and competition to award additional grants in the next fiscal year should additional funds be made available. 21 As mentioned above, FNS is interested in funding projects that address priority areas specified in Section I \"Program Description .\" If the panel review indicates that FN S has received few or no technically acceptable proposals, the selecting official may determin e that FNS will make no awards or commit less than the $5 million set aside for this purpose. NOTE: If a discrepancy exists between the total funding request (su bmitted on SF-424, SF- 424A, and budget or budget narrative) within the application package in response to this solicitation, FNS will only consider and evaluate the estimated funding request contained on SF- 424.
