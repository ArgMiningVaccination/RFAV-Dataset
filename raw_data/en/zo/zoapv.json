Juhi was born in Bombay and brought up surrounded by both allopathic and herbal medicine. She officially moved to the United States at the age of four but returned to India every summer. After life threatening complications with Crohn's disease as an adolescent, Juhi's grand mother turned to her cousin in India to help her heal. That would be Juhi's first encounter with acupuncture and though Crohn's is a lifelong ailment, her symptoms were soon cured. It was in that single experience that led Juhi to veer from her dreams of western medicine to eastern practices. Rapidly emerging as a new face of holistic living, Juhi is a thought leader in the field of acupuncture and Ayurveda pioneering her Facial Rejuvenation Program and the Acu-Facelift, a non surgical natural alternative method for facelifts, as well as Therapeutic Yoga, utilizing acupuncture and acupressure to promote healing. Juhi's clients range from professional athletes to Fortune 500 corporations, who rely on her skilled experience to keep their health running at optimal levels.

OFFERINGS: First-Time Patient Evaluation Acupuncture Facial Rejuvenation Ayurvedic Consultation BALANCE, RECHARGE & RELAX with Juhi's Acupuncture Offerings: Customized Acupuncture Treatment Acupuncture stems from the belief in Chinese medicine that imbalance is the root of disease. This 5,000 year old form of alternative medicine heals and rebalances the body. Hair-fine needles are inserted into specific pathways to correct underlying imbalances in the flow of energy or Qi, to promote rapid healing. Acupuncture Facial Rejuvenation In Chinese medicine, the face is considered the roadmap and guide of what is happening within the body. The most effective way to achieve external beauty is to address the internal imbalances. Facial Rejuvenation is a full-body acupuncture treatment that heals from the inside out. For example, darkness around the mouth is often indicative of digestive issues. By treating the physical imbalance, results can then be seen in the face. Facial Rejuvenation uses this ancient technique to also improve muscle tone in the face and neck. Ayurveda: CUSTOM NUTRITION FOR BODY, MIND AND SOUL Consultation & Diagnosis Identifying the unique nature of an individual and the origin and narrative of disease in their body/mind is an integral aspect of Ayurveda. Through a review of one's health history, diet and lifestyle as well as presenting symptoms, a diagnosis can be made to determine basic constitution as well as pathology. These assessments will inform treatment protocol designed to alleviate symptoms, restore, as well as maintain health and may include diet, herbal and lifestyle recommendations specific to each individual. Ayurvedic Nutrition Ayurveda, as an adaptogenic system of healthcare, combines lifestyle, diet, movement, meditation and daily habit along with medicine (when necessary) to decrease mental, emotional, and physical stress, thus enhancing immunity while building natural energy and clarity of body/mind. It is a behavioral medicine in its purest form. As such, bespoke 'nutrition' programmes are designed for each patient relative to both the content and the context of diet as well as lifestyle habit. Programmes adapt over time, beginning by addressing a chief complaint and presenting symptoms, then working to manage digestive capacity, immunity, and over all health and well being.
