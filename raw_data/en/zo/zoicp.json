Methods Virosomes were initially formed by contacting a lipid film containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae with viral membranes solu- bilized with the short DCPC, by adding to preformed virosomes from DMSO. Results Virosomes formed from lipid films contained the membrane glycoproteins G and F, at similar F to G ratios but lower concentrations than in virus, and the added lipids, but only a fraction of the 3D-PHAD\u00ae. By single particletracking (SPT), the virosome size distribution resembled that seen by cryo-electron microscopy, but dynamic light scattering showed much larger particles. These differences were causedby small virosome aggregates. Measured by SPT, virosomes were stable for 300 days. 3DPHAD \u00ae incorporation in virosomes could be enhanced by providing the adjuvant fromDCPC solubilized stock, but also by adding DMSO dissolved adjuvant to pre-formed virosomes. Virosomes with 0.1 of 3D-PHAD\u00ae/viral protein DMSO induced anti-body titers similar to those by virosomes containing DCPC-solubilized adjuvant .monophosphoryl lipid A . respiratory syncytial Fusion glycoprotein GMP Good manufacturing process Gp r o t e i n Attachment glycoprotein Respiratory syncytial virus SARI Severe acute respiratory infection SPT Single particle tracking TLC Thin layer chromatography TLR4 Toll-like receptor 4 VN Virus neutralizing INTRODUCTION Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of viral bronchiolitis among infants and young children, and alsocauses serious disease in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. Worldwide, approximately 120 million peo- ple are affected by a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)*T. S t e g m a n n toon.stegmann@mymetics.com 1University Medical Centre Groningen, Department of MedicalMicrobiology, University of Groningen, The Netherlands The NetherlandsPharm Res (2018) 35: 172 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-018-2453-y each year, among whom 1 million patients do not survive the infection ( 1,2). It has been shown that RSV is one of the most common pathogens to cause SARI ( 3). Despite the impact of RSV on global health, there is no vaccine available for pre-vention of RSV infection. This is in part due to the disastrous outcome of an early clinical study among young children inthe 1960s. In this trial, a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine (FI-RSV) induced enhanced respiratory disease in vaccinees upon natural infection, leading to increased morbidity and thedeath of two children ( 4-7). This unexpected response was found to be due in part to the induction by the FI-RSV vac-cine of low-affinity and poorly glycoprotein of RSV ( 8-13). While RSV vaccine development has been delayed, an effective RSV vaccine remains urgently needed. At the sametime, there is an increasing awareness that different vaccine formulations may be required for different target groups for vaccination. Live-attenuated vaccines, which mimic exposureto wild-type RSV, aim at protection of infants and young children, while avoiding enha nced respiratory disease. Alternatively, young infants in the first critical months after birth may be protected through vaccination of the mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy ( 14). In this case, the main aim of vaccination is a short-term induction of high titersof virus-neutralizing (VN) anti bodies for efficient transfer through the placenta. An inactivated vaccine comprising at least the RSV F glycoprotein may well be optimally suited for this purpose. Finally, an RSV vaccine is also needed for the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Here, it is agradual senescence or dysfunction of the immune system that may cause symptomatic disease after RSV infection, despite repeated exposure to the virus earlier on in life. Clearly, herethe aim of vaccination is to boost the pre-existing immune response. A particle-based formulation comprising both the F and G glycoproteins of the virus and containing a powerfuladjuvant, would appear to be optimal ( 8,15-18). We are developing a virosomal vaccine targeting the elder- ly and pregnant women. Virosomes are reconstituted viralenvelopes that contain the membrane glycoproteins of the virus but lack the viral nucleocapsid. Properly produced virosomes retain the receptor-binding and membrane fusioncharacteristics of the virus from which they are derived, as has been shown extensively for influenza virosomes, ( 19-21), indi- cating that the native structure of the membrane proteins was preserved. For RSV, this could be crucial, since with the early FI-RSV vaccine, discussed above, critical epitopes of the viral F glycoprotein were disrupted, which led to induction of low-affinity antibodies with a deficient capacity to neutralize the virus (22 ,23). It has been shown that potently neutralizing antibodies directed against the F glycoprotein bind to the na- tive conformation of the ( 24-26). The second envelope pro- tein, the attachment (G) protein, is the receptor binding pro-tein of the virus ( 27). Combinations of F and G protein in RSVvaccines have been shown to be substantially more immuno- genic than F or G alone ( 4,28). In initial RSV virosome vaccine candidates, we lipophilic adjuvant, mono phosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) (Kamphuis et al., 2012) and a derivative, 3-desacyl MPLA, incorporated in the virosomal membrane ( 29). 3-desacyl MPLA is used as an adjuvant in several marketed humanvaccines. 3-desacyl MPLA is 10.000\u00d7 less toxic than bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from which it is derived.Nonetheless, it remains a potent activator of the immune sys- tem ( 30). MPLA is known to activate the immune system through engagement of Toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) ( 31). This activation skews the immune response towards a Th1 T-cell response, leading to increased antibody levels of the fa vorable IgG1 subtype ( 32). Kamphuis et al. have shown that incorporation of MPLA in RSV virosomes results in increased virus-neutralizing antibody responses in mice and cotton rats compared to non-adjuvanted virosomes ( 33). The experi- ments of Kamphuis et al.a l s od e m o n s t r a t e dp r o t e c t i o no fm i c e and cotton rats against viral challenge after immunizationwith MPLA-containing virosomes ( 34). Thus, MPLA for RSV vaccines. However, MPLA and 3-desacyl MPLA are complex mixturesof about 20 molecules, differing in the number and length of acyl chains, for example, complicating vaccine production. The present study describes biochemical and physical char- acterization of a virosomal RSV candidate vaccine containingthe synthetic adjuvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae, identical to one of the most active molecules present in 3-desacyl MPLA. The studyprovides size distribution analysis by various techniques, in- cluding single-particle tracking (SPT), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), as stability studies by SPT, as well as a quantitative account of the lipid, adjuvant and protein composition of the virosomes, methods for incorporating the adjuvant, and initialcomparative immunogenicity studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Virus and Cell Culture CCL-81 Vero cells (ATCC, Wesel, Germany) were grown on Cytodex-1 beads (GE Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in 500 mL disposable spinner flasks (100 mm top cap and 2 angled sidearms, Corning,Wiesbaden, Germany) with serum-free culture L- The cellswere infected with RSV strain A2 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC VR1540), with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, at a nucleus count of 8 \u00d7 10 5cells/ml.172 Page 2 of 14 Pharm Res (2018) 35: 172The virus was harvested at 50 -80% of cytopathic effect (CPE). Cytodex-1 beads and cell debris were removed by filtration through a Pall mini Profile filter\u00ae capsule with apore diameter of 10 m (Pall, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), residual cellular DNA was digested bytreatment with benzonase (Novagus, Merck, Schwalbach amTaunus, Germany), and the supernatant was clarified through a filter train combining Sartopure PP2 filters with a pore size of 1.2 and 0.65 m (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) to re- move further particle debris. The material was concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration using a Midikros 145cm 2, pore size 0.05 m, polysulfone (PS) UF/DF filter (Spectrum labs, Breda, The Netherlands) and the medium was ex-changed for PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, y diafiltration. The virus was purified from the concentrate by gel filtration (size exclusion) chromatography. The purified and concentrated virus was rapidly frozen with cryoprotectant(10% sucrose ( w/v)) and stored at 80\u00b0C until further use. Virosome Production RSV virosome formulation and production were adapted from Stegmann et al.( 2 0 1 0 ) .Briefly, purified RSV A2 virus was concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration using a 26 cm 2, molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) 30 kDa PS ultra- filtration hollow-fiber filter (GE Healthcare), the cryprotectant was exchanged for HNE buffer (5 mM Hepes, 145 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) by diafiltration, and concentrated virus was dissolved in 100 mM 1,2 dihexanoyl- sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine (DCPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, in HNE buffer. The nucleocapsid was removed by ultracentrifugation in a table-top ultracentrifuge, S100AT4 rotor, at 50 k rpm for 30 min, and the viral supernatant was collected. In a first set of experiments, a mixture of 1,2- dioleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), 1,2-dioleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and c h o l e s t e r o l( a l lf r o mA v a n t i ) ,a l s oc o n t a i n i n g3 - d e a c y l -phosphorylated hexa-acyl disaccharide (3D-PHAD\u00ae) ( 35) (Avanti), in a 2:1 chloroform/methanol solution was evapo- rated to form a dry lipid film in a glass tube. The film was dissolved in the viral s upernatant to attain final concentrations of 850 nmol DOPE, 425 nmol DOPC, 255 nmol cholesterol, and 300 nmol 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of total viral protein in the supernatant. Alternatively, stock solutions of lipids were prepared in 200 mM DCPC in HNE and a stock solution of 3D-PHAD\u00ae (1 mg/ml) was prepared in 500 mM DCPC in HNE, and these were mixed with the viral supernatant, as further indicated in the Results section. The supernatant/lipid mixtures were incubated for 15 min on ice, filtered t h r o u g ha n0 . 2 2 m cellulose acetate filter (Whatman, Sigma Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and dialyzedin a gamma-irradiated cassette (10kD cut-off;Thermo Scientific, Geel, Belgium) against 6 \u00d7 2 l of PBS (pH 7.4) and 1 \u00d7 2 L of HNE in total for 48 h. After dialysis,virosomes were stored at 4\u00b0C until further use. Sucrose Density Gradient AnalysisThe virosomes were analyzed by equilibrium sucrose 10 -60% ( w/vlinear gra- earlier ( 36). Gradients were centrifuged in a Hitachi centrifuge for 60 h in an AH650 rotorat 50 k rpm (296,005 g). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collectedfrom the gradient and analyzed for protein using a Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay (BioRad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) ( 37), phospholipid phosphate as described before ( 38) and density by refractometry. Biochemical Analysis of RSV Virosomes Thin Layer Chromatography The virosomes were analyzed for the presence of incorporated lipids and adjuvant by TLC. TLC plates were activated at 150\u00b0C for 30 min before use. Virosome samples (non-extract-ed), and control samples (dissolved in chloroform/methanol, 2:1) were applied onto the TLC plates with a Hamilton sy- ringe. Control samples were DOPE, DOPC and synthetic3D-PHAD\u00ae, 1 to 1.5 nmol each. The plates were dried and then eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (100:75:15 by vol), and subsequently dried and incubated, under gentleshaking, for 30 s in 15 ml cerium stain (Hanessian stain: ammonium molybdate, cerium sulfate, and and developed for 10 min at 150\u00b0C. TLC plateswere scanned and the intensity of each spot (DOPE, DOPC and 3D-PHAD\u00ae) was semi-quantified by ImageJ. HPLC and LC-MS To quantify the incorporated amounts of lipid and synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae, virosome preparations, prepared with pre- dissolved lipids and 3D-PHAD\u00ae, were analyzed by TNO Triskelion (Zeist, by DOPC, DOPE The HPLC system Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000was used for this analysis with a Waters Acquity BEH Phenyl 1.7 m, 2.1 \u00d7 100 mm column, at a column temper- ature of 40\u00b0C and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Mobile phase A contained 0.1% formic acid, 10 mM NH 4Ac, 5% methanol and water, mobile phase B contained 0.1% formic acid,10 mM NH 4Ac in 100% methanol and the injection volume was 1 l. Liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (LC- MS) was conducted by M-Scan (Geneva, andor by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA), usingPharm Res (2018) 35: 172 Page 3 of 14 172proprietary methods, to d etermine the amount of 3D- PHAD\u00ae, incorporated in the virosomal membrane. SDS-Page Virosomes were on a SDS-PAGE gel (RunBlue SDS Gel 16%, Westburg, The Netherlands) followed by silver staining according to manufactures protocol(ProteoSilver Silver stain kit, Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Mark12 (Thermofisher, Breda, The Netherlands) protein standard was taken along to de-termine the size of each protein. Electron Microscopy Immunogold labeling, P alivizumab a agains t F protein (ASD Specialty Heath Care Inc., Chicago IL) and MAB858 -2 (Millipore), a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody against G protein were used. FCF-300-Ni Mesh grids (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA, USA) were first incu- bated, face downward, on a droplet of sample (virosomes1:10 dilution, virus undiluted), pH 7.4 for 5 min, then blocked with blocking agent (Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands) for 30 min and incubated for 1 h withPalivizumab and MAB858 -2, at a dilution of 1:100 (Lonza, Breda, The Netherlands) containing PBS with 5%blocking agent, grids were incubated for 1 h with second- ary antibody, 1:20 diluted i n PBS/5% blocking agent, then washed in PBS/5% blocking agent and afterwards in PBS. Secondary antibodies were a 6-nm gold-coupled goat anti-human antibody for Palivizumab anti-m 2. Grids were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min, followed by washing with water. Grids were stained for 30 s with 1% uranyl acetate and air driedfor EM analysis. Samples were also single -labeled to de- tect either F or G proteins. For this, same protocol was used as described here. Secondary antibodies were a 10-nm gold coupled goat anti-human antibody for Palivizumab and a 6-nm gold coupled goat anti-mouse antibody for MAB858 -2. Sample preparation was done in duplicate. For negative controls a random IgG mouse antibody and human-anti-human actin-beta antibody (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) were used. Images were re-corded with a Veleta camera on a JEOL JEM 1011 trans- mission electron microscope and analyzed with the soft- ware iTEM (Soft Imaging System, Munster, Germany).Cryogenic TEM Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed at the Electron Microscopy Centre of the Wageningen University (The Netherlands). Quantifoil R2/2 holey carbon grids were exposed to a glow discharge in air for20 s. Four l of the suspension was applied to each grid, which were then blotted and vitrif i e di nl i q u i de t h a n eu s i n ga Vitrobot (FEI Company). Frozen specimens were observedat180\u00b0C in a JEOL JEM2100 transmission electron micro- scope (JEOL Ltd., Japan) equipped with a Gatan CT3500cryoholder and a Gatan US4000 camera. Images were takenat 2 -4mu n d e rf o c u s . Single-Particle T racking Particle size distribution of the virosomal RSV vaccine was evaluated using a NanoSig ht a 60 mW 405 Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK) and a Hamamatsu Ocra Flash 2.8 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Hamamatsu, Japan). Before andafter each sample measurement, the sample cell was cleaned and dried according to instructions of Malvern Instruments. An appropriate dilution of the samples was prepared to obtainan optimal particle concentration between 40 and 100 parti- cles/frame. Samples were diluted in HNE buffer in two or three steps. Seven consecutive 60-s videos were recorded foreach dilution. Shutter and gain settings were optimized for each sample. The camera histogram gating was adjusted for each individual measurement to maximize sensitivity. Data analysis was performed in NanoSight NTA 3.0 or NTA 3.1 software (Malvern Instruments) in batch mode, using finitetrack length adjusted (FTLA) weighting. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)The particle size of the virosomes was also determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) in a Zetasizer Nano-ZS90(Malvern Instruments). Intensity-size distribution graphs, Z- average (mean cluster size based on the intensity of scattered light) and polydispersity index values were recorded. Eachanalysis typically comprised 3 consecutive measurements in- cluding the Z-average diameter. Ethical Statement Animal experiments were evaluated and approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation (DEC) of the University Medical Center Groningen, according to the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act (per-mit number DEC5662). Immunizations were conducted un- der isoflurane anesthesia, every effort was made to mini- mize animal suffering.172 Page 4 of 14 Pharm 172Animals specific pathogen free [SPF]), 6-8 weeks old were supplied by Harlan (Zeist, The Netherlands). Animals were immunized IM, under lightisoflurane anesthesia, by injecting 50 l of the vaccine in the calf muscles of both hind legs (25 l per leg), at a dose of 5 g of viral protein per immunization. Anti-RSV IgG ELISAs and neutralizing antibody tests were performed as described before ( 33,36)B r i e f l y ,f o r ELISA, 96-well plates were coated overnight withbetapropiolactone (BPL)-inactivated RSV. After blocking,SV-coated were incubated Biotech)for levels, stained with o- Phenylenediamine (OPD; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and read in a ELISA plate reader at 492 nm. IgG titerswere determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution with an optical density (OD) reading of at least 0.2, after subtrac- tion of the OD of the blank. The titers of virus neutralizingantibodies in were determined by incubation of serial two-fold dilutions of decomplemented serum with infectious virus, and infecting Hep-2 cells with the mixtures ( 33). RESULTS Physical and Biochemical Analysis of the Compositionof RSV Virosomes Virosomes were prepared from purified RSV virus, strain A2, as described in Materials and Methods. Briefly, purified RSVvirus was solubilized with DCPC, the viral nucleocapsid was removed by ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was added to a dry lipid film consisting of DOPC, DOPE, cholesterol and3D-PHAD\u00ae, the film was solubilized in the DCPC- containing supernatant and, after sterile filtration, the final mixture was dialyzed. The formation of virosomes was analyzed by equilibrium sucrose density-gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1). Figure 2shows the results for a typical virosome preparation. Protein andphosphate were found to co-migrate in a single peak in the gradient, indicating successful reconstitution of the viral enve- lope. The absence of phosphate outside the virosome peak indicates that DOPC, DOPE and 3D-PHAD\u00ae (which all have phosphate groups) were essentially quantitatively associ-ated with the virosomal membrane. Some non-incorporated protein was present in fraction 3 of the gradient. The protein composition of the virosomes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In unfractionated virosome preparations, the Fand G membrane proteins were found (Fig. 3a), along with the viral matrix (M), and phosphoprotein (P). G, uncleaved ornon-reduced F (F0), and its F1 subunit were identified by blot(not shown); the F1 subunit has an apparent molecular weight of 54 kDa, and the G-protein was around 120 kDa in size,corresponding to the sizes of F and G reported in the literature (39-41). On the gel, the position of uncleaved F (F0) overlaps with that of G (Fig. 3a).In the virosome fraction of the gradi- ent, F, G and M were present. The non-incorporated proteinconsisted mainly of M and P, most likely from residual nucle- ocapsid (Fig. 3b). Semi-quantitative analysis of M and P band intensity of fraction 3 and 8 by ImageJ revealed that 46% of M and 40% of P are present in virosome fraction 8. The incorporation of lipids and adjuvant into the virosomes was analyzed by th in-layer chromatography (TLC). The results of the TLC analysis confirmed that DOPC, DOPE and 3D-PHAD\u00ae were present in thevirosome preparation (Fig. 3c). To roughly quantify the amount of incorporated lipids and adjuvant, the intensitiesof the spots observed after TLC analysis of the virosomallipids, shown in Fig. 3c, were determined using ImageJ anal- ysis. The relative recoveries of DOPE and DOPC in thevirosomes were essentially equal and represented approxi-mately half of the amounts that were initially added, indicat- ing a somewhat lower recovery than that of the viral protein (64%). However, the total quantity of virosome-associated ad- juvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae was found to be less than 10% of the amount initially added. It therefore appeared that 3D-PHAD\u00ae was specifically lost during the production process. Immunogold Labeling The presence of F and G protein in the virosomal membrane, a ss h o w ni nF i g . 3a, was further examined by double immunogold electron microscopy staining. With this Fig. 1 3D-PHAD\u00ae molecular . Phosphorylated HexaAcyl Disaccharide, a fully synthetic produced monophosphoryl lipid A (source illustration: https://avantilipids.com/product/699852 ; Accessed March 20, 2018).Pharm Res (2018) 35: 172 Page 5 of 14 172technique, F and G were visualized simultaneously using spe- cific monoclonal antibodies and secondary staining antibodiescoupled to 6-nm gold particles for the F protein and to 15-nm particles for G protein. The double immunogold staining gives an indication for the ratio of F and G protein incorpo-rated in the virosomal membrane compared to that in the native virus. Several experiments showed that, in different virosome samples, the amount of virosome-incorporated F protein washigher than that of G, in agreement with the F-to-G ratio in native RSV virions. Detailed examination of the electron mi-crographs showed that the F-to-G ratio in the virus sample shown in Fig. 4b/c was 7.1:1, while that in the virosomes shown in Fig. 4a was 5.3:1. Whereas the F-to-G ratio was thus similar in virus and virosomes, the overall membrane surfacedensity of both envelope glycoproteins together appeared sub- stantially lower in the virosomes than in the virus (Fig. 4).This reduced density results from the presence of added lipids in the virosome membrane, which expands the membrane, and also from the fact that in virosomes, in contrast to virus, themembrane glycoproteins are randomly oriented, facing the inside of the virosome as well as the outside ( 21). Control single immunogold staining was performed to ex- clude possible interference b etween the gold-conjugated monoclonal antibodies directed to F and G. The resultsshowed that the number of gold particles bound to F or G did not vary between the single or double immunogold stain-ing procedures (results not shown). This indicates that during double immunogold staining, the mAbs did not interfere with each other. Other controls (as described in Materials andMethods) showed that there was no cross-reactivity between the antibodies binding to F or G (results not shown). Size Distribution Analysis of the Virosomes The size distribution of virosomes is usually determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) ( 42). By cryo-electron micros- copy the virosomes appeared heterogeneous, and a large ma-jority was smaller than 100 nm (Fig. 5).However, by DLS it appeared as though the particles were much larger, with a broad size distribution, indicating a large fraction of particles with sizes between 200 and 500 nm (Fig. 6d). Such particles were not seen at all by microscopy. To understand these discrepancies and find a reliable method to accurately determine the size of the virosomes, sizemeasurements by single-particle tracking (SPT) were tested, and some model studies were undertaken. DLS is a population-based technique, which measures the mean hy-drodynamic diameter of particles in suspension based on fluc- tuations in the light scatteri ng produced by the particles Fig. 3 Biochemical analysis of RSV virosomes.

An RSV A2 virosome preparation byequilibrium density gradientcentrifugation on a 10 -60% sucrose gradient. Fractions of 0.5 ml were taken from the bottom (left side), and the density, protein andphosphate concentration of each fraction was determined.172 Page 6 of 14 Pharm Res (2018) 35: 172(43-46). Particles are best described by the Z-average diame- ter, the intensity weighted harmonic mean using this tech- nique, but that parameter may not accurately measure parti- cle size in heterogeneous populations of particles. A Polydispersity Index (PdI) is therefore calculated from the da-ta. The lower the PdI the more homogenous the suspension. For virosomes, a PdI of <0.4 is acceptable ( 42). Single-particle tracking (SPT) measures the Brownian motion of individualparticles in liquid, which is directly related to the size of the particles by the Stokes-Einstein equation ( 47). For this tech- nique, the best measure of size is the mode, the particle size that is most frequent in the population. The reliability of size measurements in samples by DLS vs. SPT was first examined using monodisperse suspensions ofpolystyrene beads of 100 nm and 200 nm particle diameter, as well as a mixture of beads of 100 nm and 200 nm in a ratio of 2.5:1. DLS and SPT measured similar Z-average diameters and modes, respectively, for either 100-nm (93 nm by SPT,106 nm 212 nm DLS) polystyrene beads in suspension alone, showing a single peakof in the size distribution histogram (Fig. 6). Compared to SPT, the size distribution as measured by DLS was muchbroader, from 50 to 200 nm for of DLS measurements 0.026 for the100-nm and 0.021 for 100- and 200-nm beads, DLS did not resolve the two populations (Fig. 6c).DLS showed one broad peak for the mixture, with a mean size of 207 nm, which is biased towards the larger particle size, although the majority of the particles was 100 nm. In spite of this, the calculated PdI was low also, 0.095, for the mixture of 100-nm and 200-nm beads, which ab cF ( bandc)w e r el a b e l e d with two different sizes of goldparticles. The G protein was labeledwith 15 nm gold particles and the F protein with 6 nm gold particles.

Therefore, the DLS data do not accurately represent the size distribution of thesample, without revealing the problem by an elevated PdI. In contrast, SPT clearly showed a large peak at around 100 nm (mode 96 nm) as well as a small peak at around 200 nm. Figure 6d shows the size distribution of the virosomes mea- sured by SPT and DLS. The SPT measurement showed amodal size of 96.3 nm. There was a clear right-hand shoulder in the size distribution, indicating a population of larger par- ticles, or aggregates of smaller particles. The same virosomepreparation measured by DLS showed a much broader peak with a Z-average of 113.1 nm and a PdI of 0.358. As for the mixture of polystyrene beads, DLS measurements of thevirosomes thus showed larger mean particle diameters than SPT and a broader size distribution, which could be caused by the larger particles or aggregates revealed by SPT dominatingthe signal in DLS. By SPT, D10, D50 and and 107.1 nm. The D50 value, the median, is defined such that half of theparticle population has a diameter smaller than this value. Likewise, 90% of the particles have a diameter below the D90 value, and 10% below the D10 value. It was concludedthat SPT measurements were much more representative ofthe virosomes as observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 5), with the exception of the right-hand shoulder; by EM, parti- cles larger than 100 nm were not observed. It is possible that in solution, some virosomes would aggregate and move as one large particle. By EM that cannot be verified. Stability and Aggregation of RSV Virosomes Virosome samples were analyzed over time for their long- term stability to investigate if aggregates were accumulating.A fresh preparation of virosomes was measured immediately after production and then stored at 4\u00b0C for 300 days. Periodically, samples were taken and the size distribution was measured with SPT (Fig. 7,Table I)a n dc r y o - T E M (Table II). It was observed that the virosomes would sediment over time, potentially indicating aggregation of the particles.Before each SPT measurement, or electron microscopy, sam- ples were inverted several times to resuspend the sediment,and diluted with buffer. As measured by SPT, the mode and D10 changed very little over time. However, between freshly produced virosomes and all other time points, there was a Fig. 6 Polystyrene beads in monodisperse and polydisperse suspension and virosome sample measured with SPTand DLS.

Notice different scales.172 Page 8 of 14 Pharm Res (2018) 35: 172slight increase in D90, and in the number of particles in the right-hand shoulder of the distribution. An arbitrary cut-off of150 nm was chosen to characterize these (Table I) .T h es i z eo f the particles as measured by EM was consistently smaller thanthat measured by SPT and showed no trend over time. Thedifference was not due to the size limit in SPT; SPT cannotmeasure particles smaller than 30 nm, but by EM, such par- ticles were not detected. Improved Incorporation of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in the Virosomes As indicated above, the recovery of the 3D-PHAD\u00ae adjuvant in the virosomes was significantly lower than that of the othervirosomal components (Fig. 2). In the initial virosome produc- tion process, the lipids were deposited as a thin lipid film onthe wall of a glass tube, which was then dissolved in the viralsupernatant, which contained 100 mM of the short-chain phospholipid DCPC, acting as a detergent (its critical micelle concentration is about 17 mM). The 3D-PHAD\u00ae/viralprotein ratio in the mixture was 1 mg/mg. The resulting mixture was clear, suggesting all components were dissolved. After steril e filtration, virosome were formed from the filtrate by dialysis. In order to investigate the loss, and to measure 3D- PHAD\u00ae more precisely, two contract research organizationsindependently developed methods to measure its concentra- tion in a virosome sample by LC-MS, reaching similar con- clusions (Table III); indeed, less than 1% of the added adju- vant was incorporated in the virosomes. Heating the glass tube with the lipid film/viral supernatant mixture to about 45\u00b0C for about 30 min, increased t he virosome-incorporated amount of 3D-PHAD\u00ae tenfold. It was next attempted to dis-solve 3D-PHAD\u00ae in 100 mM DCPC and add it to the viralsupernatant. Although the solution appeared clear, after fil- tration the resulting virosomes still contained less than 10% of the initial amount of 3D-PHAD\u00ae. Subsequently, 1 mg/ml of3D-PHAD\u00ae was dissolved in 500 mM DCPC (the limit of DCPC solubility in water), with bath sonication for 5 -8m i n at 56\u00b0C, and mixed with stock solutions of the lipids, also in DCPC. The mixture was added to the viral supernatant, and virosomes were prepared without filtration. At these concen- trations of DCPC, it took 48 h with seven changes of buffer, tocompletely dialyze out the DCPC. The 3D-PHAD\u00ae was in- corporated quantitatively (Table III). This was then repeated with sterile filtration of the mixture. Apparently, filtration led to the loss of viral protein, but all the 3D-PHAD\u00ae was incor- porated in the virosomes, leading to an elevated 3D-PHAD\u00ae over protein ratio (Table III).

Itwas therefore attempted to incorporate 3D-PHAD\u00ae in pre-formed virosomes from a solution of 10 mg/ml 3D-PHAD\u00ae in DMSO. Virosomes were prepared with-o u t3 D - P H A D \u00ae ,a n das m a l la l i q u o to f3 D - P H A D \u00aei n DMSO (25 l) was slowly added to 975 l of virosomes with constant stirring at room temperature, at a ratio of 0.1 mg of 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of viral protein, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The virosomes were then analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation(Fig. 8). As in Fig. 2, a single peak of phosphate was found for the virosomes. The 3D-PHAD\u00ae was found tobe quantitatively incorporated in the virosomes. Immunogenicity in Mice of RSV Virosomes with Improved Levels of 3D-PHAD\u00ae To evaluate the immunogenicity of RSV virosomes with improved incorporation of 3D-PHAD\u00ae and to compare virosomes prepared by the DMSO method and the DCPC method, an immunization experiment in micewas performed. Mice were immunized twice, on day 1 and day 15 with virosomes, prepared by the DMSO method at 5 g of protein per injection. In the com- parator group, mice were immunized with virosomes containing 0.2 mg 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of protein, with 3D-PHAD\u00ae dissolved in DCPC, as described above,reasoning that the 3D-PHAD\u00ae added from DMSO would only be present in the outer leaflet of the virosomal bilayer, and that only 3D-PHAD\u00ae presentedto the immune system on the outside of virosomes would act as an adjuvant. Blood samples were taken at day 28 and analyzed for neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 9) and anti-RSV IgG (Fig. 10) as described before (33). Both preparations were found to induce similar antibody titers, indicating the quality of the virosomalvaccines produced by either method is equivalent.DISCUSSION In earlier studies, an MPLA-containing virosomal RSV vac- cine was tested in mice and cotton rats, and found to induce agood immune response with a favorable safety profile (33,34,36). Those virosomes were made by dissolving the viral membrane in DCPC, removing the nucleocapsid, adding the dissolved membranes to a dry lipid film of lipids containing MPLA, followed by sterile filtration and then dialysis of the DCPC. However, MPLA is a complex mixture of moleculeswhich is difficult to produce and to reproduce. Aiming to produce virosomes under GMP, in the current paper, a syn- thetic variant of MPLA, 3D-PHAD\u00ae, was incorporated in thevirosomal membrane and the virosomes were analyzed exten- sively. As expected, the viral membrane proteins F and G were found in the virosomes, in a ratio similar to that of the virus,albeit at a lower surface density than on virions. The lower surface density resulted from the expanded membrane, as lipids were added during virosome formation to the solubi-lized viral membrane components, and because of the ran- dom orientation of the membrane proteins in the virosomal membrane as opposed to the virus, where they face outwardonly. The lipid addition serves mainly to accommodate the adjuvant in the virosomal membrane. If the virosomes are not further purified, the preparation additionally contains at leastthe viral proteins P and M. About half the M protein was found to be virosome-associated after sucrose density gradient purification; the rest of the M and P were not virosome-asso-ciated. Most likely, associated M is bound to the C-terminus of F, as M drives the budding of virus by associating with F ( 48). While virosomes, which were made using a mixed dry lipid film of DOPE, DOPC and 3D-PHAD\u00ae, contained approxi- mately 50% of the added lipids, and all 3D-PHAD\u00ae was found in the peak of the gradient (not shown), only a fractionof the 3D-PHAD\u00ae appeared to be virosome-incorporated. These virosomes were then further characterized by size distribution measurements. Although the standard method for virosome size measurements is DLS, DLS showed much larger virosomes than could be seen by cryo-electron micros-copy. When virosomes were measured by SPT, the size distri- bution partially overlapped with diameters determined fromTa b l e I II 3D-PHAD\u00ae Incorporation in Virosomes Preparation 3D-PHAD\u00ae incorporated (mg/mg of protein) Virosomes from a dry film of lipids and 3D-PHAD\u00ae, filtration 0.009 Virosomes from a dry lipids and 3D-PHAD \u00ae, heated, filtration 0.09 Virosomes from a mM DCPC, 3D-PHAD \u00ae@5 0 0m M ,f i l t r a t i o n 1 . 5 In all cases, 1 mg of 3D-PHAD \u00aewas added to 1 mg of viral protein during the production of virosomes172 Page 10 of 14 Pharm Res (2018) 35: 172cryo-electron micrographs, except for two features; EM showed more particles with a diameter between 30 and50 nm, while SPT showed relatively more particles of 100 - 125 nm, and the size distribution by SPT had a right-handtail, showing a fraction of particles with sizes between 150 and200 nm (Fig. 7b). These data suggest that small particles might aggregate in solution, with small aggregate movements jointlyproducing a single track in SPT measurements. Model studieswere then undertaken with polystyrene beads. These studies showed that a 2.5:1 mixture of 100- to 200-nm beads is re- solved by SPT (Fig. 6c), but produces essentially a single, broad size distribution around the size of the larger particles if measured by DLS, just as the distribution found for the virosomes by DLS (Fig. 6d). Therefore, we conclude that small aggregates, whose presence is suggested by the SPT measure- ment, are causing the scattering giving rise to the distribution measured by DLS. As an indication for the underlying poly- dispersity of a sample, DLS instruments calculate a PdI. A PdI of <0.7 is usually taken to mean that polydispersity is low, andthe size distribution measurement reliable ( 49). However,both virosomes and the latex beads mixture have a polydis-persity index lower than 0.7. We noticed that virosomes would sediment after weeks to months of storage in the refrigerator, suggesting they may havea tendency to agglutinate or aggregate. Irreversible aggregationwould not be acceptable within the context of production un- der the regulations of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) (50,51). Also, particle size can have a substantial influence on the immunogenicity of vaccines. Therefore, the size distribu- tion of the virosomes was followed for a prolonged period of ten months. Virosomes had to be resuspended before each mea-surement. Over this period, the modal size and D10 remained unchanged, while there was an only slight increase in D90 and the number of particles >150 nm between production and thefirst time-point, 8 weeks later. After that, the size distribution remained constant. We conclude that the virosomes are stable and that aggregation, if it occurs al all, is largely reversible. It is possible that upon long-term storage the particles do not even agglutinate, but simply sedimen t because of their higher density relative to that of the medium.

However, since DOPC and DOPE were incorporated into virosomes from a dry lipid film also contain- ing 3D-PHAD\u00ae, while the adjuvant was not, the solubility of3D-PHAD\u00ae in DCPC seemed limited. A solution of 3D- PHAD\u00ae in 100 mM of DCPC appeared clear, but when added to the viral supernatant and filtered, it did not lead tomore incorporation. We suspect that the filtration removed aggregates or micelles of 3D-PHAD\u00ae which were not visible to the naked eye. 3D-PHAD\u00ae in 500 mM DCPC, dissolvedby heating and sonication and immediately added to the viral supernatant, was incorporated quantitatively, and this 3D- PHAD\u00ae/DCPC mixture could be filtered, either mixed withthe viral supernatant (Table III) or on its own (not shown). However, this is not the most convenient production method,as the high concentrations of DCPC may damage proteinsand lead to long dialysis times, and low temperatures are preferred. Finally, virosomes without adjuvant were formed first, and then 3D-PHAD\u00ae, which dissolves in DMSO at up to 10 mg/ml, was added from DMSO. As the DMSO mixes with water, 3D-PHAD\u00ae becomes insoluble and inserts intothe virosomal membrane; the sugar residues most likely pre- vent translocation across the membrane, so that it is only present in the outer leaflet of the virosomal membrane. Inaccordance with this, an equivalent immune response was obtained with virosomes containing 0.2 mg/mg 3D- PHAD\u00ae/protein in both leaflets after post-formation insertion from DMSO advantage of post-formation insertion of 3D-PHAD\u00ae is that the amount of adjuvant per virosome can be halved.
