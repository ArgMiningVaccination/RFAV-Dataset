Ellin Doyle, Ph.D. Food Research Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison Madison, WI 53706 medoyle@facstaff.wisc.edu INTRODUCTION Since the discovery and development of the first antibiotics prior to the Second World War, thesedrugs have played an important role in curingdisease in humans and animals. In 1946 experimentsshowed that low, subtherapeutic levels of antibioticscould increase feed efficiency and growth in foodanimals, and the addition of various antibiotics tofeed for livestock was initiated. Because preventionof disease transmission and enhancement of growthand feed efficiency are critical in modern animalhusbandry, there has been widespread incorporationof antibiotics into animal feeds in many countries(74, 144). Swine feeds in the U.S. often contain antibiot- ics for purposes of disease prevention and growthpromotion. According to data from USDA and Ani-mal Health Institute, antibiotics are currently usedin 90% of starter, 75% of grower and more than 50%of finisher feeds for pigs ( 34, 37, 38, 55, 173 ). Antibiotics have also been widely used in animal feedin many other countries although a number of indi-vidual countries and the European Union have re-cently restricted the subtherapeutic use of someantibiotics ( 3, 138, 147, 156, 166).Precise figures on the relative amounts of antibiotics used in humans and in animal agricultureare impossible to obtain. Various estimates havebeen calculated by the Institute of Medicine ( 34, 74, 174), the Animal Health Institute, a trade organiza- tion (172), and the Union of Concerned Scientists (174). Human use of antibiotics has been estimated at 1.36-14.64 million kg/yr while estimated antibi-otic use in animal agriculture is 7.36-11.18 millionkg/yr. Although estimates from different sources arenot directly comparable, it is clear that there issignificant use of antimicrobial agents both in humanmedicine and in agriculture. Currently, the potentialfor agricultural antibiotics to contribute to the devel-opment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria of human con-cern is the subject of intense debate and research ( 3, 74, 163, 166). DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIBIOTICRESISTANCE Bacteria are very adaptable organisms because oftheir very short generation time (as little as 15 to 20minutes for some species under ideal conditions) andtheir propensity bacteria. The pres- ence of an antibiotic may kill most of the bacteria inan environment but the resistant survivors can even-tually re-establish themselves and pass their resis-tance genes on to their offspring and, often, to otherspecies of bacteria. Both medical and veterinary usesof antibiotics have resulted in the appearance ofresistant strains of bacteria. Resistant bacteria whichare human pathogens may cause diseases that aredifficult to treat; even if the resistant bacteria are nothuman pathogens, they may still be dangerous be-cause they can transfer their antibiotic resistancegenes to other bacteria that are pathogenic ( 18, 74, 144, 163, 166). Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, includ- ing Salmonella spp., E. coli, and Campylobacter spp., have been isolated from farm animals in manycountries ( 1-6, 14-16, 19, 21, 36, 63, 85, 87, 89, 90, 100, 128, 131, 151, 155, 158, 168 ). Fluoroquinoline- resistant C. jejuni have recently been detected in chicken following the introduction of fluoroquinolinesinto feed for chickens ( 135, 137). A draft risk assess- ment of the threat this may pose to human consumersof chicken has been prepared by the FDA's Centerfor Veterinary Medicine ( 150). GROWTH-PROMOTING EFFECTSOF ANTIBIOTICS Feeding swine with subtherapeutic levels of anti-biotics has been documented to increase weightgain by 3.3-8.8% and improve feed efficiency by2.5-7.0%. The exact mechanisms by which thisoccurs are not completely understood. Since feedantibiotics provide a relatively greater improvementin farms with poor hygiene, their effectiveness is atleast partially due to suppression of some pathogenicbacteria in livestock. Subtherapeutic antibiotics havebeen shown to reduce the incidence or severity dysentery, porcine intestinal adenomatosis,porcine hemorrhagic enteropathy, and Clostridium perfringens infections. Some scientists believe that these effects on pathogens are the primary or onlyrelevant effect of the antibiotics affecting growthpromotion ( 34, 35, 56, 138, 147, 148 ). Other researchers believe that the antibiotics alter the normal, non-pathogenic flora of the gut andthese changes have a beneficial effect on digestiveprocesses and the utilization of nutrients in feed. Ithas been estimated that as much as 6% of the energyin a pig's diet may be lost due to microbial fermenta-tion in the stomach and small intestine. Antibioticsadded to feed alter activities of microbial populationsand may thereby prevent some of this loss to micro-bial fermentation. Intestinal bacteria also inactivatepancreatic digestive enzymes and metabolize dietaryprotein with the production of ammonia and biogenicamines, such as cadaverine. Antibiotics inhibit theseactivities and increase the digestibility of dietaryprotein. Antibiotics also appear to prevent irritationof the intestinal lining and may enhance uptake ofnutrients from the intestine by thinning of the mu-cosal layer (10, 35, 138, 148). Experiments with a growth promotant contain- ing chlortetracycline, penicillin, and sulfamethazinehave shown that treated pigs have higher serumlevels of insulin-like growth factor I (53, 54 ). Thus the effects of subtherapeutic antibiotics may extendbeyond digestion in the intestine and stimulate meta-bolic processes throughout the animal. In addition to positive effects on growth and efficiency, there are reductions in excretion of nitro-gen, phosphorus, and manure by antibiotic-treatedpigs (124, 138 ). These effects are most probably consequences of the more efficient utilization of feed.When waste disposal from swine operations is con-sidered, these reductions will have a positive eco-nomic impact. Two groups ( 55, 160) have reviewed the poten- tial economic consequences of a ban on the use ofsubtherapeutic antibiotics in swine production in theU.S. The more recent review estimates that produc-tion costs would increase by $5.00-$6.00 per headand this would increase the retail cost of a pound ofpork by $0.05 ( 55). However, costs would vary greatly among different swine producers dependingon the size and types of facilities and current hus-bandry practices. Following Sweden's ban on the useof antibiotics as growth promoters, total use of anti-bacterial drugs in animals has decreased so that by1998 the total animal usage of antibiotics was only38% of that used in 1984 (prior to the ban) ( 13, 24, 156). In the first years following the ban there was an increase in postweaning piglet disease and mortality http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/antibiot.pdf/G46/G52/G49/G20/G42 /G52/G49/G45/G46/G49/G4E/G47/G53 /G3A/G20/G20/G20/G20/G41/G6C/G74/G65/G72/G6E/G61/G74/G69/G76/G65/G73/G20/G74/G6F/G20/G41/G6E/G74/G69/G62/G69/G6F/G74/G69/G63/G20/G55/G73/G65/G20/G66/G6F/G72/G20/G47/G72/G6F/G77/G74/G68/G20/G50/G72/G6F/G6D/G6F/G74/G69/G6F/G6E/G20/G69/G6E/G20/G41/G6E/G69/G6D/G61/G6C/G20/G48/G75/G73/G62/G61/G6E/G64/G72/G79 3 /G50/G72/G65/G70/G61/G72/G65/G64/G20/G62/G79/G20/G4D/G2E/G20/G45/G6C/G6C/G69/G6E/G20/G44/G6F/G79/G6C/G65/G2C/G20/G50/G68/G2E/G44/G2E /G41/G70/G72/G69/G6C/G20/G32/G30/G30/G31 /G46/G6F/G6F/G64/G20/G52/G65/G73/G65/G61/G72/G63/G68/G20/G49/G6E/G73/G74/G69/G74/G75/G74/G65/G2C/G20/G55/G6E/G69/G76/G65/G72/G73/G69/G74/G79/G20/G6F/G66/G20/G57/G69/G73/G63/G6F/G6E/G73/G69/G6E/G96/G4D/G61/G64/G69/G73/G6F/G6E /G46/G75/G6E/G64/G65/G64/G20/G69/G6E/G20/G70/G61/G72/G74/G20/G62/G79/G20/G74/G68/G65/G20/G4E/G61/G74/G69/G6F/G6E/G61/G6C/G20/G50/G6F/G72/G6B/G20/G50/G72/G6F/G64/G75/G63/G65/G72/G73/G20/G43/G6F/G75/G6E/G63/G69/G6Cand an increase in antibiotics prescribed to treat disease. However, as producers improved hygiene,sanitary and other husbandry practices, incidence ofdisease decreased and antibiotic use declined steadily. In evaluating the possible alternatives to subtherapeutic use of antibiotics, one must considernot only their relative short- and long-term costs butalso their ability to produce the same positive effectsas the antibiotics. It may well be necessary to adoptchanges in the management of livestock and alsointroduce different feed components in order to com-pensate for the antibiotics' effects and maximizeproduction. Genetic improvements in animals andvaccinations to prevent establishment of harmfulbacteria may also be useful. Therefore, some of thealternatives described below may be part of thesolution for decreasing or eliminating antibiotic usein animal agriculture even though they do not mimicall the beneficial effects of antibiotics. One shouldalso always be alert to the possibility that some ofthese alternatives may also have unintended negativeeffects that are not immediately apparent. ALTERNATIVE FEEDINGREDIENTS The three primary effects of the antibiotic growthpromoters are: /G9Fincreased growth, /G9Fimproved feed efficiency, and /G9Fa lower incidence of certain diseases To be effective, alternative additives for swine feedshould generate similar benefits as the antibioticswhich are currently used as growth promoters in pigrearing operations. However, alternative feed additives or supple- ments may have different mechanisms of action andother positive or negative effects which must beconsidered. It may be necessary to combine two ormore alternative feed ingredients or to combine anew feed supplement with a change in husbandrypractices to achieve the best effects. For the mostpart, the scientific references gathered do not com-pare relative costs of implementing various changesbut rather report data on the efficacy of these supple-ments as regards pig health and growth. An excellentreview of many alternative feed ingredients is pre-sented by Thomke et al. ( 149). Probiotics and competitive exclusion Probiotics are live cultures of microbes\u2014often lacticacid bacteria but also some other species\u2014which arefed to animals to improve health and growth byaltering intestinal microbial balance. Some authorsalso consider extracts of these cultures, for exampleisolated yeast cell walls, to be probiotics even thoughthey do not contain living cells. Some bacterial cul-tures are used specifically for competitive exclusion(CE): They are fed in one or a few doses to newbornor newly hatched animals in order to quickly estab-lish an intestinal flora that will prevent colonizationby pathogenic bacteria. Competitive exclusion prepa-rations are not always pure cultures of bacteria, andtheir microbial composition may not be completelyknown. Some CE cultures have proven effective inprotecting chicks from Salmonella infections. Results from some experimental trials with probiotics, initiated 20 to 30 years ago, were incon-sistent due to variations in bacterial cultures used,age of pigs treated and other factors related to feedcomposition and husbandry practices. Recently in-terest in the use of probiotics to improve the growthand health of livestock has been rekindled by currentproposals to curtail sub-therapeutic doses of antibi-otics in animal feed. Experiments with new probioticcultures under more controlled conditions have dem-onstrated beneficial effects of probiotics fed to pig-lets in many, but not all, cases. Probiotics, likeantibiotics, appear to have a more pronounced effecton farms where housing and hygiene are not optimal(95, 149). Piglets are born \"germ-free\" but immediately begin acquiring intestinal microbes, with bacteriasuch as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria , and Bacteroi- des often comprising up to 90% of the normal flora. After weaning, there is a large drop in the populationof lactic acid bacteria and an increase in coliformbacteria. Escherichia coli is the bacterium respon- sible for most of the diarrhea in newly weaned pig-lets, and its increase is most likely related to thedecrease in lactic acid bacteria. In addition, pigletsacquire other may exist unobtrusively in small numbers and only multiply to cause illnesswhen piglets are stressed by other infections or con-ditions (95). Probiotic microorganisms added to feed may protect piglets from intestinal pathogens by severalpossible mechanisms, sometimes referred to as com-petitive exclusion: to mucosa thereby of antimicrobial compounds such asbacteriocins and organic acids /G9Fcompetition with pathogens for nutrients /G9Fstimulation of intestinal immune responses In addition, probiotics may affect the permeability ofthe gut and increase uptake of nutrients (79, 95, 127,141, 142, 165). Recent research reports that have demonstrated positive effects of probiotics for pigs include thefollowing: /G9FLactobacillus and Bifidobacteria increased weight gain and reduced mortality in youngpiglets (7). /G9FLactobacillus casei improved growth of pigletsand decreased diarrhea and appeared to be moreeffective than subtherapeutic antibiotics ( 32). /G9FLactobacillus casei fed to gnotobiotic (germ-free) piglets adhered well to the intestinalmucosa and produced lactic acid, lowering thepH. These piglets consumed more milk andgained more weight than germ-free piglets ( 26, 99). /G9FEnteracide, a probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecium, added to feed for weaned piglets stimulated growth andactivity of the digestive system ( 152). /G9FAddition of Streptococcus faecium to piglet diets increased weight gain and feed efficiency ( 76). /G9FMixtures of Lactobacillus spp. and Strepto- coccus spp. increased growth and some measures of immune function in piglets ( 154). /G9FDigested bacterial cell powder from Brevi- bacterium lactofermentum decreased incidenceand severity of diarrhea in piglets ( 97, 153). /G9FPiglets fed Bacillus coagulans had lower mortality and improved weight gain and feedconversion than unsupplemented piglets and didas well as or better than piglets fed subthera-peutic antibiotics ( 8)./G9FCenBiot, a probiotic containing Bacillus cereus, improved weight gain and feed conversion inyoung weaned piglets and also decreased theincidence of diarrhea as well as the addition ofsubtherapeutic antibiotics ( 169). /G9FBacillus licheniformis improved weight gain and feed conversion and reduced diarrhea andmortality in piglets ( 77). /G9FThe probiotic B. licheniformis and B. subtilis ) increased feed efficiency and growth of piglets more than an antibiotic ( 28). /G9FPiglets fed the probiotic Bacillus toyoi or cerevisiae, Lacto- bacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus faecium had a significantly greater weight gain ascompared to those given antibiotics in feed(159). /G9FSaccharomyces boulardii and B. cereus var. toyoi were found enhance nutrient transport in pig jejunum additive ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) tended to consume more feed and gain more weight. In some cases, results fortreated piglets were significantly better ( 22, 123); in other experiments, the improved results werenot significant ( 88). /G9FEnterococcus faecium 18C23 was found toinhibit the adhesion of enterotoxigenic E. coli to the small intestinal mucus of piglets ( 69). /G9FA mucosal competitive exclusion culture(originating in healthy pigs) and fed to pigletswithin a day of birth significantly reducednumbers of Salmonella choleraesuis ( 10, 44) and E. coli (50) detected in gut tissues and feces after challenge doses of these pathogens. /G9FSeveral other brief reports of positive resultsfrom the use of probiotic cultures in pigs havebeen published (97 ). Other researchers reported that feeding probiotics did not improve performance or decreaseincidence of diarrhea: /G9Fpiglets given Enterococcus faecium a variety of gastrointestinal enzymes to aid in digestion of feed. However, newly weaned pigletsmay produce inadequate amounts of certain enzymesand even adult pigs cannot digest some plant materi-als containing complex carbohydrates, such as cellu-lose, xylans, and -glucans ( 111). Therefore, the addition of enzymes to feed may be a useful strategyto increase its digestibility. Dietary enzymes maysupplement the pig's own digestive enzyme activityor enable the pig to utilize the energy in complexcarbohydrates which normally pass unchangedthrough the gastrointestinal tract. The enzyme phytasecan decrease the antinutritional of phytatewhich binds 50-75% of the phosphorus in vegetablematter. Without this enzyme, pig feed must be supple-mented with phosphates because pigs can use only20-40% of the phosphorus in plant foods. The re-maining phosphorus in the vegetable matter is elimi-nated with the fecal material. Phytate also appears tointerfere with the digestion and absorption of otherminerals such as calcium ( 111, 165). Recent reviews of the currently available enzymes used as feedsupplements and prospects for further developmentsin this area have been published by Bedford andSchulze (20) and Thomke and Elwinger ( 149). Some data indicate that addition of carbohy- drate-degrading enzymes (amylase, glucanase,glucoamylase) to a barley-based diet improved feedconversion (but not average growth) and reducedincidence of diarrhea in pre- and newly weaned pigs(66). Other experiments demonstrated no growth advantage for inclusion of enzymes to degrade starch,fiber, proteins or fats in a wheat-based diet forweaner pigs ( 107). The efficacy of enzyme additives appears to depend on several factors including theage at weaning, other components of the diet, and thesource of the enzymes. Carbohydrate-degrading en-zymes, isolated from different bacteria and molds,usually differ somewhat in their activity againstspecific compounds. Nutrient utilization and performance of grow- ing pigs fed hulless barley was improved by a mix-ture of and feedconversion were improved by 8.6 and 8.7%, respec-tively (17 ). Another experiment reported that an antibiotic, avilamycin, and an enzyme, xylanase,increased digestibility of organic matter, protein,fiber, and fat to the same extent in growing pigs fed adiet containing barley, wheat, soy, and wheat bran.Growth rate was slightly increased in both groupsfed one additive and was increased significantly in agroup fed both enzyme and antibiotic ( 120). Another issue to consider in feeding enzymes to pigs is whether the enzymes can survive passagethrough the acidic stomach and then act to digestfeed components in the small intestine. Pentosanase,which is inactive under acidic conditions, was foundto survive passage through the stomach and aideddigestion of rye-soybean dietary material in smallintestine ( 145). Phytase was found to increase weight gain and, in some cases, decrease feed conversion ratios in pigsfed different diets: a barley-maize diet ( 48, 58), a corn-soybean diet ( 75, 122, 140, 171), a low phos- phate pearl millet-soy diet ( 98), a pea-barley-wheat- soy diet (103 ), and sorghum-soybean meal diet (104 ). Experiments with cannulated pigs, with a tube in-serted for sampling intestinal contents, demonstratedthat phytase tripled the pre-cecal breakdown of phytatebut much of the liberated phosphate was absorbed byintestinal bacteria. Later this phosphate was ab-sorbed into the pig from the cecum/colon ( 132, 133). Apparent ileal digestibility of crude protein and aminoacids was also improved by the addition of phytase toa corn-soy diet (73 ). This may be the result of disruption of phytate-protein complexes. Phytase enzymes from several sources have been tested and some are more heat-resistant thanothers and so may be better suited for incorporationinto diets which are to be treated with steam ( 65, 102, 140). In addition, phytase activity is affected by the calcium:phosphate ratio in the diet, with higherratios associated with lower enzyme activity anddecreased growth rate ( 117, 119). Experiments comparing the effects of phytase and supplementary inorganic phosphate indicatedthat 500 U phytase/kg feed was approximatelyequivalent to 0.87-0.96 g of inorganic phosphate/kgin improving daily weight gain and phosphatedigestibility in growing /G50/G72/G65/G70/G61/G72/G65/G64/G20/G62/G79/G20/G4D/G2E/G20/G45/G6C/G6C/G69/G6E/G20/G44/G6F/G79/G6C/G65/G2C/G20/G50/G68/G2E/G44/G2E /G41/G70/G72/G69/G6C/G20/G32/G30/G30/G31 /G46/G6F/G6F/G64/G20/G52/G65/G73/G65/G61/G72/G63/G68/G20/G49/G6E/G73/G74/G69/G74/G75/G74/G65/G2C/G20/G55/G6E/G69/G76/G65/G72/G73/G69/G74/G79/G20/G6F/G66/G20/G57/G69/G73/G63/G6F/G6E/G73/G69/G6E/G96/G4D/G61/G64/G69/G73/G6F/G6E kg weight), 246 U microbial phytase/kg was functionally equivalent to 1 g inorganic P/kg feed (75 ). The use of phytase also decreases the amount of phosphate in swine manure by as much as 30%(52). High levels of phosphorus are detrimental to lakes and rivers and so a number of Europeancountries have regulations restricting the disposal ofmanure based on its phosphorus content. In theNetherlands, France, and Denmark, the overall aver-age excretion of phosphorus/pig is 1.0, 1.34, and1.23 kg. These numbers reflect the widespread use ofphytase in feed for Dutch pigs and lower levels ofphytase used in other countries (115, 116 ). Although this issue of excretion of phosphorus is not directlyrelated to growth-promoting effects of phytase, eco-nomic considerations related to waste disposal mayaffect the overall cost/benefit evaluation of whetheror not to use phytase as a substitute (or partialsubstitute) for antibiotics in feed. Immune modulators Immunologically active compounds affect the work-ing of the immune system and may enhance resis-tance to disease. These substances include antibodies,cytokines, spray-dried plasma, and other compounds.Some or all of the growth-promoting effects of sub-therapeutic antibiotics in feeds may result from theiraction against sub-clinical infections or competitiveintestinal bacteria. Therefore, it has been suggestedthat addition of antibodies or other immunoactivecompounds to feed may accomplish the same pur-pose. Vaccines may be important in preventing somediseases which may arise when antibiotics are with-drawn. The importance of developing new vaccinesand potential benefits of vaccinating sows whichwould then provide antibodies to piglets in colostrumwere discussed in a recent review (60 ). But vaccines may not replace antibiotics as growth promotersbecause they specifically target pathogens whileantibiotics affect general bacterial populations inthe gut. Piglets get protective antibodies from their mothers through colostrum but these last only abouta month. Since young pigs do not produce sufficientquantities of their own antibodies until they are about4 months of age, there is a period of several monthswhen young piglets are particularly susceptible todiseases such as scours ( 93). Antibodies against pig disease organisms have been produced by immuniz-ing hens which secrete antibodies against swine patho-gens into egg yolks. These antibodies inhibit theattachment of pathogenic bacteria to the intestine(97). Freeze-dried eggs or egg yolks containing anti- bodies to calf diseases have been used successfully incalf milk replacers and reduced the need forsubtherapeutic antibiotics (111 ). Freeze-dried eggs containing antibodies against porcine rotavirus and some strains of E. coli are also available. Lyophilized egg yolks with antibodies toporcine enterotoxic E. coli cured 92% of sick piglets when added to one batch of feed. Protimax (hyper-immunized spray dried egg protein) dramaticallyreduced mortality due to diarrhea and improvedweight gain and feed conversion (93 ). Spray-dried porcine plasma proteins (which contain immunoactive proteins) also reduce mortal-ity and diarrhea and improve growth in piglets. Aswith antibiotic additives, better results were obtainedunder more stressful and less hygienic conditions. Inexperiments with newly weaned piglets, the additionof spray-dried porcine plasma proteins to a corn-soydiet resulted in faster growth than the addition ofantibiotics ( 31, 33). However, the feed conversion ratio was better in the group fed the antibiotics. Oneproblem with spray-dried plasma is that it may con-tain antibodies specific to bacterial strains present onone farm but which are different from those on otherfarms. On large farms in Latvia, it was noted spray-dried plasma from one farm reduced piglet mortalityby 20% on the same farm but was ineffective atanother farm (101 ). More than 12 antimicrobial peptides have been detected in pigs. Most of these compounds kill bacte-ria by disrupting cell membranes, and it is believedthat bacteria may be slower to develop resistance tothese compounds. A recent comprehensive review ofporcine antimicrobial peptides was presented byZhang (170 ). These antimicrobial agents in pig hus- bandry could be added directly to diets, or it may bepossible to genetically engineer pigs to produce greateramounts of these compounds. It may also be possibleto transfer the genes responsible for synthesis of http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/antibiot.pdf/G46/G52/G49/G20/G42 /G52/G49/G45/G46/G49/G4E/G47/G53 /G3A/G20/G20/G20/G20/G41/G6C/G74/G65/G72/G6E/G61/G74/G69/G76/G65/G73/G20/G74/G6F/G20/G41/G6E/G74/G69/G62/G69/G6F/G74/G69/G63/G20/G55/G73/G65/G20/G66/G6F/G72/G20/G47/G72/G6F/G77/G74/G68/G20/G50/G72/G6F/G6D/G6F/G74/G69/G6F/G6E/G20/G69/G6E/G20/G41/G6E/G69/G6D/G61/G6C/G20/G48/G75/G73/G62/G61/G6E/G64/G72/G79 7 /G50/G72/G65/G70/G61/G72/G65/G64/G20/G62/G79/G20/G4D/G2E/G20/G45/G6C/G6C/G69/G6E/G20/G44/G6F/G79/G6C/G65/G2C/G20/G50/G68/G2E/G44/G2E /G41/G70/G72/G69/G6C/G20/G32/G30/G30/G31 /G46/G6F/G6F/G64/G20/G52/G65/G73/G65/G61/G72/G63/G68/G20/G49/G6E/G73/G74/G69/G74/G75/G74/G65/G2C/G20/G55/G6E/G69/G76/G65/G72/G73/G69/G74/G79/G20/G6F/G66/G20/G57/G69/G73/G63/G6F/G6E/G73/G69/G6E/G96/G4D/G61/G64/G69/G73/G6F/G6E /G46/G75/G6E/G64/G65/G64/G20/G69/G6E/G20/G70/G61/G72/G74/G20/G62/G79/G20/G74/G68/G65/G20/G4E/G61/G74/G69/G6F/G6E/G61/G6C/G20/G50/G6F/G72/G6B/G20/G50/G72/G6F/G64/G75/G63/G65/G72/G73/G20/G43/G6F/G75/G6E/G63/G69/G6Cthese peptides into some microbe which could pro- duce large quantities of these antimicrobial com-pounds at a lower cost. Experiments with chickens have shown that some cytokines (which are normal regulators of theimmune response) can act as growth promoters per-haps by stimulating the immune system to ward offpathogens. As such, it has been proposed that thesecompounds may be a substitute for sub-therapeuticantibiotics in feed. Avian cytokine genes have beencloned and can be delivered to chickens in a viralvector. With more research, porcine cytokines mayalso become available for use as growth promoters(86). Conjugated linoleic acid has also been shown to affect immune function in laboratory animals byincreasing production of T-cells and interleukin-2(67). Organic acids (Acidifers) Organic acids contain one to seven carbon atoms.They are widely distributed in plants and animalsand are also produced during microbial fermenta-tion. These acids and their salts are often used asfood preservatives and, since they are easy to handle,can be used to acidify feed. Weaned piglets are physiologically immature and may not produce enough hydrochloric acid (HCl)to keep stomach pH at an optimum of approximately3.5. At this pH, digestion of proteins and populationsof beneficial bacteria (lactobacilli) are maximizedand harmful bacteria are inhibited. Diets fed to youngpigs often have a high buffering capacity, which canfurther reduce stomach acidity. Therefore, organicacids added to feed can have a beneficial effect inmaintaining a low pH (25 ). A recent meta-analysis of data on growth- promoting effects of organic acids in weaned pigletsfound that the acids generally improved performancebut the magnitude of the effect varied with the amountof acid used and other components of diet. Fumaricacid usually caused a greater weight gain than formicor citric in young piglets while formic acid was moreeffective in fattening pigs ( 110). Data on several possible mechanisms for growth promotion, includ-ing inhibition of undesirable microbes, increaseddigestibility of proteins, and changes in intestinalmorphology, were reviewed. In fact, although these compounds lower feed and gut pH, their effects are not simply a result ofacidification because neither dietary HCl nor phos-phoric acid improved growth or feed conversion ofpiglets. It is likely that the antimicrobial effects of theorganic acid ions, which act by controlling bacterialpopulations in the upper intestinal tract, are respon-sible for the beneficial effects of these acids ( 125). Fumaric acid was more effective than HCl and theantibiotic tylosin in reducing populations of variousbacteria in small intestine of weanling pigs as com-pared to control pigs consuming feed with no addi-tives (49). On the other hand, addition of 1% formic acid reduced feed pH from about 6.2 to about 4.5 butdid not decrease diarrhea in weanling pigs ( 45). A recent review (68 ) concluded that data from many experiments showed that the effects of fumaric andformic acids on gut pH and flora are inconsistent.Lactic acid, however, was more consistent in reduc-ing gastric pH and coliforms. Inconsistent resultsmay be due to the variety of diets with differentbuffering capacities that were used in these experi-ments. Bacteria are known to develop acid-resis-tance when exposed to acidic environments for sometime. This should be monitored when acids are addedto feed over the long term ( 113). Recent data demonstrating the improved feed conversion ratio and growth-promoting effects offormates ( 109, 126), citric acid (119 ), and formic acid (134) indicated that the effect was greater dur- ing growth of young pigs than during the finishingphase of growth. Several researchers cited evidence that organic acids also improve the digestibility and absorption ofproteins, minerals, and other nutrients in the diet ( 68, 73, 94, 110, 119, 125 ). However, in another feeding study with young piglets neither fumaric nor citricacid additives improved efficiency of amino aciddigestion or absorption (161 ). Organic acids (such as fumaric, formic, lactic) are commonly added to swine feed in many Europeancountries. As the use of antibiotics has decreased, theuse of acids in feed has increased. At one pound perton, organic acids have been approved for control-ling mold and help control Salmo- nella and other enteric pathogens. Two problems may occur at higher organic acid levels: (i) palatabil-ity may be decreased, leading to feed refusal ( 110) and (ii) acidic feed is corrosive to cement and galva-nized steel in swine housing. In order to minimizethese effects, the natural buffering capacity of feeds(related to mineral and protein content) should beevaluated to determine the minimum effective amountof acid to use ( 23). Salts of organic acids, such as formates and diformates, are not as corrosive and can be used tosignificantly improve growth rate and feed conver-sion in weanling pigs (109, 112, 125). Another strat-egy to extend the effectiveness of acid supplementsand reduce corrosion damage to housing materialsis the use of a slow-release form of acid. It consistsof organic acids with fatty acids and mono- anddiglycerides mixed to form microgranules. Testsshow that use of these granules, as compared touse of free acids, results in greater feed intake andgrowth (30). Fermentation may be a less expensive and equally effective way of acidifying diets. Weanlingpigs, fed liquid basal diets of cooked cereal and milkproducts acidified to pH 4 with lactic acid or byfermentation with Pediococcus acidilactici, achieved similar weight gains and feed efficiency ( 47). Several million tons of liquid by-products of food industries,containing sugars and starch, are recycled into pigfeed in Europe. These products, including wheatstarch, cheese whey, and potato steam peel, areeasily fermented to achieve a pH between 3.5 and4.4. Feeding pigs diets containing these fermentedliquid products increases weight gain and improvesfeed conversion ratio (129 ). Fermented liquid feeds which are high in yeast, high in lactic acid bacteriaand high in lactic acid have been found to improvegrowth performance (68 ). Other feed supplements Minerals Zinc (3000 ppm) or copper (250 ppm) added to piglet diets containing antibiotics significantly im-proved average daily weight gain, feed intake andfeed efficiency. When the minerals were addedtogether, their effects were not additive (59, 136).Use of zinc oxide in Denmark has led to decreaseduse of antibiotics in swine feed. Zn not onlyimproved performance of piglets but also reducedincidence and severity of diarrhea in piglets ( 61). Rare earth elements have been described as performance-enhancing feed additives in Chineseliterature for some time. Recently, a rare earth mix-ture (containing lanthanum, cerium, and praseody-mium) was tested in swine grown under \"western\"conditions and was found to significantly improveweight gain and feed conversion (57 ). Vitamins Vitamin E supplements did not appear to improve feed intake or weight gain in growing pigs (48 ) but did have a statistically significant effect on reducingweanling diarrhea ( 78). Conjugated linoleic acid Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) refers to a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acidwith conjugated double bonds in the region ofcarbon atoms 8-13. It has been demonstrated tohave anticarcinogenic effects and, in laboratory ani-mals, reduces the proportion of body fat andincreases lean tissue. In experiments with pigs fedisoenergetic, low fat diets containing 1-3% CLA orvegetable oil, CLA did not affect total energymetabolism but nonsignificant increases in lean tis-sue and weight gain were observed in some groupsof animals ( 96). In several other experiments with pigs fed up to 1% CLA in the diet, small improve-ments were seen in average daily weight gain andfeed efficiency during some stages of growth butthese increases were not always significant ( 41, 42, 67, 105, 106, 108, 146). Two recent reviews (42, 67)summarize the earlier work and compare differencesin methodology. Phospholipids Lysoforte, a phospholipid product, can aid in nutri- ent uptake from digestive tract. Addition of lysofortesignificantly improved growth and feed conversionof piglets but not of older, growing pigs diets may be deficient in one or more amino acids, and this can limit growth rate of pigs andresistance to disease. Simply adding more protein tothe diet may increase the absolute amounts of theselimiting amino acids but will not provide an optimummix of amino acids and may increase intestinal disor-ders. Much of the additional protein may be \"wasted\"because it contains excess amounts of more commonamino acids. Therefore, supplements of the limitingamino acids have been added to diets to improveperformance of pigs (149 ). /G9FSupplementation of a barley, wheat, soybean dietcontaining 13.5% with the aminoacids lysine, methionine and threonine resultedin a greater growth rate and feed conversion ratioin growing pigs than feeding an unsupplementeddiet containing 15.8% crude protein ( 12). /G9FAddition of threonine to a maize, soybean,rapeseed and cottonseed meal diet increasedweight gain and feed conversion in growing pigsand also improved immune function ( 73). /G9FIn another experiment with finishing pigs fed alow protein corn-soybean diet, the addition ofindividual amino acids did not improve growth(135). Carnitine Carnitine is synthesized in the body from lysine and methionine but the enzymes needed to dothis may be at low levels in piglets. Trials addingcarnitine to piglet diets usually improve dailygrowth, and supplements to sows increase pigletsurvival and weight gain. However, results fromfield trials are not always statistically significant(82). When carnitine (25 or 50 mg/kg feed) was added to feed for 10 kg pigs, no improvement wasnoted in incidence of diarrhea or in ADG or feedefficiency ( 71). Carbohydrates (Polysaccharides; Fiber) The incidence of swine dysentery is related to diets fed to pigs: In experiments with weanling pigs, cookedrice (which is expensive) completely prevented dys-entery while pigs fed steam-flaked corn and steam-flaked sorghum had significantly less sickness thanthose fed hammer-milled and extruded wheat. Thesteam flaking process makes these feeds more digest-ible and so there is less non-starch polysaccharidepassing through into large intestine. Fermentation ofthese polysaccharides in the colon apparently en-courages growth of dysentery-causing bacteria (114 ). Heat treatment of barley and maize for swine dietsalso increased weight gain and feed efficiency inpiglets (compared to diets with no heat treatment)(92). Non-digestible oligosaccharides added to diets of 9-week-old pigs did not improve performance butrather temporarily decreased feed intake ( 62). Some other polysaccharides appear to have beneficial effects when added to swine feed ( 149). Some of these compounds are sometimes calledprobiotic chemicals because they enhance the growthof probiotic bacteria. Feeding of Jerusalem artichokemeal (rich in fructans which act as bifidogenic fac-tors) increased weight gain and feed intake of piglets(43). Feeding of fructooligosaccharides decreased shedding of S. typhimurium in a trial in Canada (80 ). A preparation of sugar beet fiber with lactose, termedCellulac, may aid piglets in resisting pathogenicbacteria by increasing lactic acid levels in the intes-tine. This would encourage the growth of lactic acidbacteria which could prevent the establishment ofpathogens (121 ). Herbs The quest for alternatives to sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics in swine feed has recently included thetesting of a number of herbs or herbal mixtures. Therationale for using these \"natural remedies\" is thatmany herbs and spices are known to have com-pounds with anti-bacterial effects (which may pro-tect pigs against pathogens). Herbs may also increasethe palatability of diets and thereby increase feedintake. In most cases, these studies have been con- ducted in Europe and a number of reports are pub-lished in journals which are not available. However,I will mention below studies which reported positiveeffects. If there is further interest in some of thesereports, it should be possible to contact the authorsdirectly. /G9FAn herbal mixture containing great nettle, garlic,and wheat grass was reported to improve growthand feed efficiency in growing reported to improve growth and reduce dysentery(164). /G9FHomeopathic remedies were reported to reduceincidence of disease in pigs ( 9, 91). /G9FOregano and a mixture Aromex (a mixture ofessential oils, spices and herbs) were reported toincrease growth and in some cases reducediarrhea in pigs ( 93). Alternative Husbandry Practices Although alternative feed supplements may compen-sate to some extent for the reduction or elimination ofantibiotics in feeds, some changes in swine hus-bandry practices may also be important. Only a briefoverview with some recent reviews as references ispresented here. In addressing a problem such as theelimination of antibiotics in animal feeds, one shouldreconsider many aspects of swine rearing operationsto determine whether changes in breeding and hus-bandry practices as well as changes in feed composi-tion will be important parts of the solution. Good hygiene is, of course, very important for preventing the spread of disease among livestock. Ifthe routine use of antibiotics in feeds is discontinued,it may be necessary to be even more rigorous inmaintaining clean environments for livestock (13 ). Improvements in the pig-rearing environment whichhave demonstrated effectiveness include ( 34, 139): /G9Fattention to efficient cleaning methods andeffective sanitizer use to minimize spread ofdisease /G9Fmaintenance of an appropriate ventilation ratesince pathogens may be spread through the air /G9Fappropriate environmental temperatures /G9Fstocking rates appropriate for size of the farm /G9Fcareful record keeping to identify problem areas Weaning is a particularly stressful time for piglets, with new foods and social groupings andinteractions being introduced. The piglets' normalintestinal bacterial populations are not well estab-lished, making them more susceptible to pathogensin the environment. There are trade-offs betweenearly weaning, which can reduce exposure to patho-gens, and a later weaning, which allows a greaterdevelopment of intestinal function and normal bacte-rial populations. Segregating newly weaned pigletswith age-mates in clean facilities (all-in-all-out) canreduce exposure to pathogens which may be shed byolder pigs ( 39, 90, 143). However, data from U.S. swine producers indicate that early weaning (before28 days) was associated with increased mortality(84). Feeding practices may also affect spread of disease. Automated liquid feeding systems wereassociated with a decreased risk of infection withSalmonella as compared to trough feeding in a study in the Netherlands ( 167). Improved feed conversion ratios were observed in swine herds in the U.S.that used three or more different rations during thegrowing-finishing phase ( 40, 83). Biotechnology may lead to improvements in the genetic background of pigs, making them moreresistant to diseases such as edema ( 11, 97). Other possibilities, which will require considerable timeand investment to develop, include pigs that canutilize feed more efficiently because of an alteredexpression of gut enzymes or nutrient absorptionpotential in the gut lining. New techniques in biotech-nology may also lead to improved vaccines, moreeffective probiotic preparations, feed plants withlower concentrations of antinutritional factors orincreased amounts of useful nutrients, and othergenetic changes in pigs which allow them to growfaster or be more resistant to various pathogens.Many of these possibilities were discussed in recentreviews (27, 64).
