Are you one of the 75 million American adults who have hypertension (high blood pressure)? In 2017, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology lowered the numbers used to diagnose hypertension to 130/80 millimeters of mercury (instead of 140/90) to encourage early intervention when it comes to blood pressure management. If left untreated, high blood pressure can lead to heart disease, stroke, vision loss, kidney failure, and other serious complications. The good news is that high blood pressure can be controlled with proper treatment, including healthy lifestyle choices!

Why is the colonoscopy the most common screening test for colorectal cancer? Colonoscopy is the most common screening test for colorectal cancer because it can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. In other words, if we detect a polyp in the colon that can increase risk for colon cancer, we can remove it at the same time. Other screening tests for colon cancer do not provide that all-in-one benefit. This one screening test can greatly reduce our risk of dying from colon cancer. How should patients prepare for a colonoscopy? Excellent bowel preparation is critical for a colonoscopy because it allows every bit of the colon to be seen and, if needed, treated safely. Typically, the day before the exam, patients will be on a clear liquid diet (no solids), and then start drinking a colon cleansing solution to clean the colon. A pre- procedure nurse contacts the patient a few days prior to the procedure to go over and personalize all instructions.Dan Patel, MD Assistant Professor of Medicine Center for Swallowing and Esophageal Disorders Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Richard S. Miller, MD, FACS Professor of Surgery Chief, Division of Trauma, Surgical Critical Care and Emergency General Surgery Passion at Work What keeps you connected to and passionate about your work? There is no better job than helping to save lives! I look forward to getting out of bed every day and coming to \"work\" with the finest Trauma and Acute Care Surgery team in the country. In a dynamic workplace like VUMC, how do you keep your team informed? First and foremost, I have an open- door policy and all my partners know they can discuss any issue with me personally and confidentially day or night. We also have a bi-monthly divisional meeting with faculty, nurses, and nurse practitioners. I am a firm believer that everyone plays a vital part in excellent patient care. What do you do to celebrate the accomplish - ments of others on your team? We celebrate accomplishments through postings on our office bulletin board plus banners and balloons on office doors, desks, and walls!! Most impor- tantly we verbally recognize each indi- vidual's contributions to our division, department, and the institution. How do you focus on your personal well-being while still managing responsibilities at work? I have two permanent items etched into my office white board. SCSC-STAY COOL/STAY CALM and ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING. I find the time for my personal health and wellness by eating healthy foods, maintaining my fitness, and mind- fulness. Having a very supportive family and the unconditional love of our dog, Sadie, helps immensely. Q::uni......A... Dear Counselor, I heard someone talking about self-compassion, but I don't understand the concept. Can you help? Seeking Compassion A::uni......A... Dear SC, Thanks for your question. Self-compassion is a concept that is well-known in Buddhist and other contemplative practices. Recent research has found that the practice of self-compassion can be useful in dealing with the physical and emotional pain that all human beings face. The concept is very simple \u2014 when dealing with painful moments or emo - tions, treat yourself as you would treat a good friend. For example, many of us judge ourselves harshly when we make a mistake. We might think, \"I'm so stupid,\" or continue to think about the mistake long after it happened. However, you wouldn't tell a friend they were stupid. You'd likely treat them with compassion and care instead of criticism and blame. According to Kristin Neff, author of Self-Compassion , the practice has three principles: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness. Essentially, by being aware of what you are experiencing in the present moment (mindful- ness) you can notice your own pain, remind yourself that all people have pain (common humanity), and that you can be kind to yourself during difficult moments (self-kindness). Try this brief practice for yourself: When you notice physical or emotional discomfort, take a few breaths and say to yourself slowly, This is a painful moment. Everyone struggles at times. May I accept myself as I am. As you continue to practice, you may find other words that you prefer. For more information, call Work/Life Connection s-EAP at 615.936.1327. Work/Life Connections-EAP Manager Work/Life Connections - EAP \"With self-compassion, we give ourselves the same kindness and care we'd give to a good friend.\" Occupational Health Clinic talk: Heart Health: Loving Your Heart Muktar Aliyu, MD, DrPH, FACOEM, FACPM Associate Professor of Health Policy & Medicine Attending Physician, Vanderbilt Occupational Health Clinic Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. February is Heart Health Month. \"While heart disease is very common, affecting at least one in two men and one in three women over their lifetime, it is also very pre - ventable,\" says Dr. Thomas J. Wang, Director of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Here are some tips on how to love your heart so you can stay in good health: Stop all tobacco use and exposure. Smoking is an important and preventa - ble cause of heart disease. Quitting smoking significantly lowers your risk of heart disease. Make heart-smart food choices. Reduce your intake of foods rich in saturated fats and trans fats. Eat more plant-based meals. Bake, broil, steam, or grill your food. Get moving! Regular exercise is essential to a healthy heart. At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week will keep your heart happy. Keep an eye on your cholesterol levels. Based on your age and medical history, your doctor can provide you with personalized recommendations for the timing and frequency of cholesterol checks. Keep your blood pressure under control. Have your blood pressure checked as often as your health care provider recommends. See \"Make Control Your Goal!\" on page 1 for more information! Manage stress. Consider stress coping tools, such as deep breathing and meditation. At least seven hours of sleep each night is good for your heart. Quality time with your loved ones may also help lower your stress.Care Gap Alerts Vanderbilt Experts on Health Colorectal Cancer (continued from page 1) How has the colonoscopy prep changed over the years? The type of colon cleansing solu - tions for colonoscopy has not changed significantly over the years, but how we take the solution has changed for the better. Previously, patients used to drink four liters of colon cleansing solution the night prior to the procedure, but newer studies have shown that doing a split prep (two liters the night prior to the procedure and two liters on the morning of the procedure) is significantly more effective in clean - ing the colon and better tolerated! How long does a colonoscopy take? The colonoscopy itself usually takes only 30 minutes, but patients should allocate approximately two hours for the procedure. Most of that time is needed for preparation (starting an intravenous line, discussing seda - tion options, and recovery after the procedure). Do patients need to follow any special instructions after a colonoscopy? Once the procedure is completed, it is recommended that the patient refrain from driving or operating heavy machinery for 24 hours due to use of sedatives during the pro- cedure. Most patients can resume their usual diet post-procedure! Why should New Year's get all the resolve? This Valentine's Day make a resolution to listen with your whole heart! Listening well is vital to fostering stronger relationships. Show you care about whom you're speaking with by giving them your full attention! Follow these tips to improve your listening skills: A Valentine's Resolution: Listening Whole-Heartedly March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month Get Involved! Listening is a form of respect. Do it well and strengthen your relationships! Maintain eye contact with the speaker. Put away your devices and avoid scanning the room and fidgeting. Listen respectfully. Let the speaker finish. Maintain an open, calm manner. Quiet your mind. Put your inner self-talk on pause. Focus and listen attentively to the speaker, rather than prejudging or thinking about what you will say next. Concentrate. The more you learn to deliber- ately listen to others, the more they're inclined to listen back to you and share mutual under- standing. Decorate Your Work Area Blue Decorate your work area in blue for the month of March to raise awareness for colon cancer screening. See how you could remind people that colon cancer screening should begin at age 50. Examples might include decorating a reception area, window, door, or breakroom. Wear Blue Day Friday, March 1 Wear blue to show your support and raise awareness about colon cancer screenings. Dress yourself, your family, or your pets in blue and share your photos with the Vanderbilt community and our Twitter account @WellVanderbilt.

Instead of reaching for those sweet and salty treats, try choos - ing from the stress-busting foods below! Choose C's \u2014 To boost your immune system and lower stress hormone levels, choose foods high in vitamin C. Oranges, kiwi, broccoli, strawberries, pep - pers, and leafy green vegetables are excellent sources. Grains and Greens \u2014 Whole grains and green vegetables contain complex carbohydrates, which help the brain produce serotonin. Serotonin is a neuro - transmitter that plays a role in regulating our mood and helps us feel more upbeat! Happy Hydrating \u2014 Water makes up about 60% of our body, so drinking enough fluids keeps the body functioning smoothly. Dehydration can lead to feeling tired, difficulty con - centrating, and little energy to exercise. In general, eight 8- ounce glasses of water a day can keep you hydrated, but let thirst be your guide! Fun Fatty Acids \u2014 Foods that are high in omega-3 fatty include salmon, anchovies, flaxseed, almonds, are proven to reduce stress hor- mones and help guard against depression. Overall, a healthy, balanced diet provides our brains and bodies with the nutrients neces - sary to improve our mood, boost our immune system, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
