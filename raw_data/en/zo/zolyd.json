(1) Other terms used to describe such pr actice s include functional, integrative, herbalism, homeopathy, holistic, unconventional, nonconventional, nontraditional, new age and natural . Traditional medicine refers to the standard of practice that is widely used by the medical community and has been proven safe and efficient. Introduction of CAM The practice of c ompleme ntary and alternative medicine (CAM) has steadily been implemented in many regions of the world. Since each country has its own traditions or indigenous forms of healing . The application of CAM varies by culture and access to conventional modalities .(2-4) Studies have indicated that individuals who choose CAM do so for various reasons including: (1) increased demand for all health services, (2) a desire to increase awareness of available options, (3) dissatisfaction with existing health care services, (4) an interest in being treated as a whole, (5) a need for more personal autonomy and control over health care decisions, (6) desire for a plan of care that is compatible with their values, worldview or beliefs regarding nature and the meaning of health and il lness and ( 7) disease prevention. (2-5) People misconstrue the term \"natural\" for safe, when the two may not be related. Many complementary and alternative therapies are based on unscientific and unproven sources ( i.e., hearsay, religion, tradition, superstition, propaganda, fraud, etc.). Scientific methods have not clearly established the efficacy of many of the alternative therapies and some have been proven to be ineffective or harmful .(6) Thus , many CAM practices and procedures have not 2 gained acceptance in the traditional medical community and are not considered to be a standard of care . Multiple modalities of CAM are lacking data from scientific evidence -based research. Safety and efficacy of the modal ities listed in Table 1 have not been determined based on the standards of Western medical practice methodologies or specific guidelines for use of the modalities have not been developed. (List may not be all inclusive): Table 1. CAM Modalities Lacking Evidence Based Support Based on Clinical Trials Modality Brief Explanation of Modality Active release technique Relief of tissue tension using a soft tissue method (manipulation and movement) to remove fibrosis/adhesions Acupressure Uses fingers to apply steady force on specific pressure points to mobilize chi or life force energy to and aid in healing Applied kinesiology Belief that various muscles are linked to internal organs and glands. Evaluates structural, chemical and mental aspects of health using manual muscle testing. Aromatherapy Uses natural plant extracts topically or through inhalation to promote health and well being Art therapy Color Light Music Clinical use of expressive art forms to promote optimal functioning of physical and emotional health Ayurveda Prevention and maintenance of health through balance of thinking, diet, lifestyle and the use of herbs Biofield therapeutics Healing Touch Pranic Healing Reiki Qigong Biofield tuning Regenetics Method Noninvasive therapy that stimulates healing by the practitioner interact ing with the clients field of energy and surroun ding information Energy therapy where practitioners use their hands in a heart -centered way to support and facilitate physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health No-touch energy healing that focuses on the 11 major chakras in the body and uses the body's inborn ability to heal itself. Palm/hands -on healing is used to transfer a universal energy through the palms of the hands of the practitioner to the individual in order to promote emotional or physical healing. Use of tuning fork to the scan for resistance and turbulence in an individual's energy field. The body's organization energy uses the coherent vibrational frequency of the tuning fork to \"tune\" itself. Utilizes intention and vowel sounds at specific frequencies to activate a systematic \"biofield cleanse\" which clear out distortions within one's biofield that may be negatively impacting physical, emotional, and mental health. Coffee Enema Detoxes the liver by absorbing the coffee enema through the venous system in the lower part of the colon. The liver is stimulated to produce more bile and in turn flushes out toxins. Combined Electrochemical Therapy High frequency electrical stimulation and peripheral nerve block purported to treat peripheral neuropathy by first Injection of the peripheral nerve with a local anesthetic, \"nutraceuticals\" (mostly vitamins), followed by a high frequency electrical stimulation. The techniques is purported to treat peripheral neuropathy. Crystal healing Proponents of this technique believe that crystals act as conduits for healing. Positive, healing energy flows into the body as negative, disease- causing energy flows out. Cupping Speci al cups are placed on the skin to create suction for the purpose of helping with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation, well -being and as a type of deep tissue massage. Dry Hydrotherapy Treatment that uses heated water in a self -contained device such as a table or chair which circulates around the individual in a massaging or pulsing manner. (i.e., Aqua Massage) 3 DUTCH Testing Dried Urine Test for Comprehensive Hormones (DUTCH) involves the collection of a small amount of urine on filtered paper one to four times a day. Mapping of hormone metabolites adrenal glands, sex hormones and melatonin are used to treat a multitude of aliments including sleep issues, fertility problems, stress, fatigue, decrease muscle mass or bone density, aching joints, loss of libido, lowered immunity, endometriosis, PMS, painful periods, fibrous breasts, and lowering the risk of estrogen dominant cancers such as brea st, cervical, and uterine (not a comprehensive list) Ear Candling Ear candles are hollow cone candles made of wax -covered fabric. The pointed end is placed in the ear while the other end is lit. The warm \"suction\" is believed to remove earwax, improve hearing, and treat conditions like sinus infections and colds. Full Body Hyperthermia Systemically targets abnormal cells and pathogens by raising the temperature of the entire body . Patients body temperature is raised to 102o - 104oF Functional Intracellular Analysis Evaluates and leverages an individual's interaction between nutrients and their genes, pathophysiology and biochemistry to optimize function Gc-MAF Gc protein (known as vitamin D(3) -binding protein) is the precursor for the principal macrophage- activating factor ( MAF ) and is used on the theory that it has various functions as an immune modulator . Gc-MAF is injected into the body to encourage macrophage activation, anti -angiogenic activity and anti - tumor activity. Guided imagery Mental images are used to stimulate or re -create the sensory perception of sights, sounds, tastes, smells, movements and images associated with touch Hair analysis Used to identify or monitor trace minerals or toxins in the body High dose Vitamin C May decrease cell proliferation in a variety of cancer cell lines ( i.e., prostate, pancreatic, hepatocellular, colon, mesothelioma and neuroblastoma) Homeo pathy Whole body approach where products come from plants, minerals or animals Hydrogen peroxide therapy Intravenously used to treat ailments such as cold, flu and sinus infections. Hypnosis Uses the power of suggestion to promote recovery of suppressed memories or to encourage behavior modification Immunoimagery Consists of guided imagery, deep relaxation exercises, visualization videos and/or audio stimulation to promote healing from within using the mind- body connection to stimulate the imm une system. Intravenous Therapies Antioxidant Micronutrient Phospholipids Ingredients thought to counteract the effects of free radicals. Free radicals are substances that cause oxidative stress, which may contribute to aging ad certain diseases. Minerals, trace elements, amino acids, vitamins and fatty acids used to improve the physical and mental performance into old age. Also, a popular approach to treat fibromyalgia. Series of infusions containing phospholipids, glutathione (an intracellular antioxidant) folic B12, usually given weekly. Inversion therapy Suspends the individual upside down to stretch the spine and relieve back pain. Laetrile Drug that contains purified amygdalin - a compound found in the seeds or kernels of many fruits, raw nuts, beans and other plant foods. It is converted by the body into hydrogen cyanide which is believed to be a source of anticancer effects. Magnet therapy Uses static magnets to alleviate pain and other health concern s Meridian therapy Includes specialized tools, which stroke the skin in the direction of the flow of blood and lymph, improving circulation, removing toxins, lifting sagging facial contours, minimizing fine lines and wrinkles and improving radiance. Myot herapy Assess, treats and manages pain associated with soft tissue injury and restricted joint mobility caused by muscle or myofascia dysfunction using therapies that include muscle stretching, TENS, passive stretching, dry needling, cupping, acupressure a nd muscle energy techniques. 4 Naprapathic Medicine (Naprapathic ) manipulation, u se of h eat, cold, light, water, radiant energy electricity, sound, air, and/or other adjunctive therapies , focusing on the soft tissue s (muscle, fascia ) to treat connective tissue disorders.

Traumeel is a non- standardized compounded substance whi ch is available topically, orally and by injection. Ultraviolet blood transfusion Exposure of the blood to light to heighten the body's immune response and to kill infections. Visceral massage Gentle manual therapy technique that assesses the relationshi p between the body's organs ( i.e., bladder, bowel, uterus, etc.) and other structures like muscles, fascia, ligaments and joints. Regulatory Status Due to demand for CAM in the United States the number of CAM products being imported has increased. To clear up potential confusion the FDA released a draft guidance (2006) that clarifies when a CAM product is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or the Public Health Service Act. (7) According to the draft, any labeling of a dietary supplement that is intended to treat, prevent, cure, diagnos e or mitigate a health condition will be regulated as a drug under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic A ct. Biological products ( i.e., vaccine s) will be regulated under the Public Health Service Act. The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 deems that homeopathic products cannot be promoted as a treatment or a cure without competent and reliable scientific evidence. Food and Supplements The Dietary Supplemental Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 classifies dietar y supplements as one or a more of the following: vitamins, minerals, herbals or other botanical s, amino acids, any di etary supplement used by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent or extract , or any combination of any ingredient .(8) Dietary supplements are regulated differently than prescription and over -the-counter drug products. Manufacturers of dietary supplements are responsible for ensuring that their products are safe. Per the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 and the Durham -Humphrey Amendment of 1951, the FDA, rather than the indus try has the burden of proving that a dietary supplement is unsafe or misbranded. The FDA monitors adverse effects 5 after dietary supplements are on the market. (9) Manufacturers are not required to obtain premarket approval for a new dietary supplement, nor are they subject to a specified post - market surveillance period. The FDA Center for Food Safety and Nutrition is empowered by the Federal Food and Drug Act of 1906 (The Wiley Act) to remove unsafe food substances and botanicals from the market. It also al lows the FDA to monitor safe use of any substances added to food. (10) Marketing The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is charged with accurate marketing and advertising claims .(11) Medical Policy Statement The use of c omplementary and /or alternative therapies/ practices, medicine or supplements that are not supported by valid scientific studies are considered experimental/investigational . There is insufficient evidence in the current medical literature to show that any of these approaches are safe and/or as be neficial as the current standard of care. Ancillary services such as visits, imaging and testing that are performed primarily to facilitate the delivery of an unproven/investigational service are also considered investigational in n ature and not a covered benefit. Inclusionary and Exclusionary Guidelines (Clinically based guidelines that may support individual consideration and pre -authorization decisions) N/A CPT/HCPCS Level II Codes (Note: The inclusion of a code in this list is not a guarantee of coverage. Please refer to the medical policy statement to determine the status of a given procedure .) Established codes : N/A Other codes (investigational, not medically necessary, etc.) : Multiple * Prescription medications are generally subject to pharmacy benefit. Pharmacy benefits exclude coverage for over- the-counter medications, including vitamins and dietary supplements. 6 Rationale Alternative Medicine is defined as a broad set of healt h care practices that are (a) not practiced based on scientific knowledge or experience, (b) part of t hat country's own tradition, and/or (c) not integrated into the dominant health care system. While there is a growing interest in CAM , there are still many concerns about the quality and quantity of evidence that supports its use . In order for CAM to be considered an integral part of healthcare, it must be supported by valid scientific evidence. (2,4) The federal regulation of food, dr ugs, cosmetics, biologics, medical products is legally mandated by federal legislation. L aws that establish FDA's regulatory authority have recently been expanded to:(12) Cover new product areas Expand enforcement powers Provide for new funding sources Modernize surveillance Inspec t and investigate methods Enhance public education efforts. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) encompasses a wide variety of health care practices, products and therapies which are distinct from those of conventional or traditional medicine. CAM is the use and promotion of related and unrelated theories that include the following: Biologically plausible p ractices with some evidence Practices that lack clear evidence and ar e contradicted by basic science Products which have been proven to be ineffective, toxic or harmful. Providers, practitioners and individuals are beginning to recognize that there may be some safe and effective CAM that could contribute to improved health. However, in order for CAM to reach its full potential, individuals, providers and practitioners must be able to make an informed decision based on knowledge of the potential benefits and potential risks of the service(s) in question. In contrast to FDA approved products, many CAM therapies lack scientific evidence regarding safety and efficacy. Complementary health approaches vary and can be categorized as follows :(1,13-15) Alternat ive systems of medical practice (ie., Ayurvedia, Chinese medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy ) Bioelectromagnetic therapies o Use of electrical currents or magnetic fields (ie., bone repair, electroacupuncture) Biologically -based practices o Use of various substances found in nature (ie., herbs, foods, over-the-counter supplements, ozone therapy, cellular therapy , marijuana) Energy therapy (ie., acupressure, crystal healing, cuppin g, qui gong, magnet therapy, Reiki) Manipulative and body -based practices (ie., colonic irrigation, ear candling, inversion therapy, reflexology, Rolfing) 7 Mind -body interventions o Use of the mind (ie., color therapy, guided imagery, hypnosis, meditation, yoga) Challenges Complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM) is widely used around the world and it has become a global phenomenon. Because of this, policymakers , health professionals and the public are strugg ling with issues regarding the safety, effectiveness, quality, availability, preservation and regulation of C AM. Since, c omplementary medicine includes a wide range of products and treatments with therapeutic claims , it is difficult to precisely define CAM. Supplements Ventola (2010) discusses differences in the regulation of traditional medication and dietary supplements. (16) In the U.S. dietary supplements are not regulated nearly as strictly as drugs are, with respect to efficacy and safety testing or mark eting claims. In 1994, Congress enacted the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) which classifies dietary supplements as food, regardless of their use. (17) Under this act, manufacturers are required to submit a New Dietary Ingredient application to the FDA for approval. The FDA reviews the applications for potential safety problems, but under the DSHEA, manufacturers are not required to prove efficacy or safety. DSHEA places the burden on the FDA to prove that a dietary supplement is unsafe. This is distinctly different from the FDA approval process for pharmaceuticals, in which manufacturers must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product before it is approved for sale in the U.S. Biomedicine or medicine uses medical science to apply the principles of biology, physiology, molecular biology, biophysics and other natural sciences to clinical practice. CAM differs from traditional medicine in that the latter utilizes responsible investigation of the practice and accepts t he outcome even if results show it to be ineffective, ultimately resulting in evidence - based practices. (18) The NCCIH (2015) warns of the possibility of drug interactions, direct toxicities, and contamination with active pharmaceutical agent , indicating t hey are among the safety concerns regarding dietary and herbal supplements. (19) Although there is a widespread public perception that herbs and botanical products in dietary supplements are safe, research has demonstrated that these products carry the same dangers as other pharmacologically active compounds. Significant drug interactions have occurred when complementary medicine has been joined with traditional medicine, negatively impacting the functional treatment and ultimate outcome. This includes biologically active forms of alternative medicine and some herb al remedies. The lack of regulation, evidence, and knowledge of these products emphasizes the need for pharmacists to accurately research their use in order to prevent reactions or interactions The current regulatory environment for dietary supplements in the U.S. is insuffi cient and presents significant public safety risks. (20) Regulation, Safety and False Claims Alternative medicine consists of a wide range of health care practices, products, and therapies. CAM is less regulated than traditional medicine and is often performed by non- physicians who are not governed by medical licensing laws. Safety and efficacy of integrative medicine are controversial. Some treatments have been associated with unexpected fat al side effects. 8 Ineffective regulation of CAM and consumer protection have sparked concerns regarding false claims . Traditional medical providers are concerned that the use of CAM will cause life limiting consequences if patients delay pursuing care measure that are proven to improve overall health. Relatively little has been scientifically proven regarding the efficacy and safety of most CAM and dietary supplement treatments, so these therapies are still considered to be nonstandard care. (21) Reliable, objective, scientific evidence is needed to establish the clinical utility of CAM approaches, to determine the level of safety and efficacy, and whether the approach is more effective and improves health outcomes over conventional methods. A voluntary anonymous questionnaire was distributed at two conferences for general practitioners organized by the Family Medicine Department of Semmelweis University. One hundred ninety -four general practitioners answered the questionnaire (39.8% response rate). Fourteen percent of the responders were license d in at least one of the complementary and alternative therapies, 45% used complementary and alternative therapy in their family in case of illness. It was the opinion of the majority (91.8%) that it was necessary to be familiar with every method used by their patients, however, 82.5% claimed not to have enough knowledge in complementary medicine. Eight -six percent of the responders thought it was necessary to have Graduate or Post Graduate education in the field.(2 2) Summary: The amount of research on CAM approaches var y widely depending on the practice. Primary care physicians are concerned regarding their lack of education regarding CAM modalities, benefits, uses and potential side effects or inter actions with proven standard of care. Although some CAM practices may provide health benefits, others are associated with risk or are purely commercially driven. Risks associated with CAM products, services and practi tioners include use of poor quality , adulterated or counterfeit products, unqualified practitioners, delayed or misdiagnosis, failure to use effective conventional treatments, exposure to misleading, incomplete or unreliable information, direct adverse events, side effects or unwanted treatment interactions. Many societies and care givers agree that understanding of the benefits of CAM therapy need to be better established. Health care workers have expressed concerns regarding mainstream healthcare education of CAM therapies as they pertain to uses and potential interactions. Concerns have been voiced that pursing CAM therapy may delay known standards of care thus potentially causing harm by postponing a well -established, lifesaving treatment. Multiple professional societies were reviewed and they agreed that the true efficacy and safety of CAM therapies are still unknown. Further well -constructed studies are needed using larger sample sizes, longer durations, and comparable measures while controlling biases. Current studies lack sufficient evidence, have methodological flaws, lack replication of responses, or are of poor quality making them insufficient to support or refute the use of the CAM therapies being studied. Caution is advised in using therapies which lack s ufficient evidence. However, substantial evidence exists that some therapies may be toxic or cause harm. Current standard of care is aimed at protecting consumer health by ensuring medications, practices, technology and care are safe and of high quality; thus, providing access to preventative, curative and rehabilitative health services. With an international market and lack 9 of standardized regulations, it is a challenge to assure safety and efficacy of medications and products produced in countries other than where it is being utilized. Many complementary and alternative treatments lack solid research on which to base sound decisions. The dangers and possible benefits of many complementary and alternative treatments remain unproven. The large diversity of products, practices and practitioners make it difficult to identify qualified CAM practices. Supplemental Information American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) In their clinical review of CAM which included vitamins D, E, C and A, magnol ol, quercetin, resveratrol, ma huang (ephedrine sinica), Ayurvedic medicine, Kampo medicine for the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis, the AAAAI concluded that further studies are needed using larger sample sizes, longer study d urations, comparable absolute measures, and well -constructed study designs that control for biases. They also stated that the following are unknown: the true efficacy and safety of CAM therapies, the efficacy of CAM therapies alone (as alternatives) in the treatment of various disorders, the individual CAM therapeutic mechanism of effects (some may be multiple), the active component of individual CAM therapies, the potential drug- drug and drug- herbphytochemical and vitamin interactions. (23) American Academy of Neurology (AAN) The AAN (2014) conducted a systematic review of the literature to develop recommendations for CAM. Due to the lack of evidence or the poor quality of the evidence, AAN concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support or refute the use of Chinese medicine, hippotherapy, massage therapy, hypnosis, mindfulness training, music therapy, naturopathic medicine, neural therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, tai chi, and yoga. (24) American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) The AAP Task Force on Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the Provisional Section on Complementary, Holistic, and Integrative Medicine (2008) published guidance on the use of CAM in pediatrics. The Task Force concluded that pediatricians and other clinicia ns who care for children have the responsibility to advice and counsel patients about relevant, safe, effective, and age- appropriate health therapies including CAM and should routinely inquire as to whether or not the patient is using any specific CAM ther apies. They advised the clinician to work with the parents to consider and evaluate all appropriate treatments and monitor the patient's response to treatments. They also stated that the physician should be knowledgeable about CAM therapies and evidence- based information. (25) American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology ACMT and AACT discourage use of homeopathic medications, non -vitamin dietary supplements or herbal supplements a s treatments for disease or preventive health measures. They Societies explain that \"natural\" products are assumed safe and effective, but there is a lack of stringent quality control of the ingredients present in many herbal and dietary supplements. R eliable evidence that these products are effective is lacking and substantial evidence exists that they may cause harm. Concerns are voiced regarding delaying or 10 replacing effective forms of treatment or compromising the efficacy of traditional medicine(s).(26) Australian Medical Association The Australian Medical Association supports evidence- based medicine. In doing, so it points out that many complementary therapies do not stand up to the rigorous standards of Western medical practices. The organization enc ourages both doctors and consumers to be well informed of the therapies they use in treating various illnesses, especially in children.(2 7-29) National Cancer Institute (NCI) NCI (201 9) states that cancer patients using or considering complementary or alternative therapy should discuss this decision with their health care provider to ensure coordination of care. NCI notes that some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Patients should become informed about the therapy, including whether the results of scientific studies support the claims that are made for it. (30) NICE (2018) put out a statement that said, \"Complementary therapies should not replace conventional treatment.\" Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australasian Integrative Medicine Association The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australasian Integrative Medicine Association considers it essential that scientific research is carried out in such a way as to permit complementary medicine to be assessed on an evidence basis. The key principle of evidence based medicine should be the basis of evaluating complementary medicines and/or therapies and their use by the medical profession. (31) Spanish Association of Paediatrics Medicines Committee The Spanish Association of Paediatrics Medicines Committee (SAPMC - 2019) conclude that no health professional should recommend treatments not supported by scientific evidence. They recommend that diagnostic and therapeutic actions should be always based on protocols and clinical practice guidelines. The SAPMC support that Professional Associations sanction, or at least reprobate or correct, health professionals who, under a scientific recognition obtained by a university degree, promote the use of therapies far from the scientific method and current evidence, especially in those cases in which it is recommended to replace conventional treatment with pseudo- therapy, and in any case if said substitution leads to a clinical worsening that could have been avoided. (32) World Health Organization (WHO ) The World Health Organization (2013) encourages policy makers and consumers to consider how T&CM m ay improve patient experience and population health. (2) WHO promotes producing guidelines for traditional and complementary medicine ( T&CM ) by developing and providing international standards, technical guidelines and methodologies for research into products, practices and practitioners . They support clinical research projects regarding safety and effectiveness and have developed a goal to strengthen quality assurance, safety, proper use and efficacy of CAM by regulating products, practices and practi tioners. Data is being gathered which highlights the ongoing demand for T&CM products, practice and practitioners, describes the importance of integrating T&CM into universal health coverage and identifies some of the difficulties and challenges of integrating T&CM into health systems. Review and analysis of worldwide T&CM status is encouraged to assist Member States determine how and 11 when T&CM should be integrated into their national health systems. Support of safe access to products and services requires a new level of cooperation among Member States regarding the collection, review and analysis of quality data pertaining to T&CM practices.
