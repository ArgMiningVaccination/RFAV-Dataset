how does the healthcare provider determine what is wrong andwhat to do to restore the patient to good health? The answer depends on the patient'ssigns and symptoms and the results from medical tests. In this book you will learnto identify these signs and symptoms, interpret the medical test results, and performthe nursing interventions that will assist in solving or alleviating the patient's med-ical problem. Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified contains 15 chapters, each providing a description of a major body system and the diseases and disorders which can affect that system. The discussion of each disease or disorder is divided into the followingsections: What Went Wrong? Prognosis Hallmark Signs and Symptoms Interpreting Test Results Treatment Nursing Diagnoses Nursing Intervention Crucial Diagnostic Tests The \"What Went Wrong?\" section presents a brief description of how the body is affected when the particular disease or disorder occurs. The \"Prognosis\" section dis- cusses the possibilities of curing this disease and permanent damage which canoccur. The remaining sections present the information as lists of symptoms, diag-noses, etc. that make it easy for you to learn and that also serve as a useful tool forlater reference. A Look Inside Since Medical-Surgical Nursing can be challenging for the beginner, this book waswritten to provide an organized, outline approach to learning about major diseases Copyright \u00a9 2007 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click here for terms of use. and the part the nurse can play in the treatment process. The following paragraphs provide a thumbnail description of each chapter. CHAPTER 1 CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM The mere mention of the cardiovascular system brings all sorts of images to mind;however, these impressions are based on our experience as patients. Healthcareproviders have a different view because they see it as a system that distributes nutri-ents and oxygen throughout the body and delivers carbon dioxide and metabolic by-products to various organs for removal from the body. Failure of the cardiovascularsystem has a compound effect because it interacts with the body's other systemscausing a chain reaction of events. Healthcare providers need a thorough under-standing of what can go wrong with the cardiovascular system; in this chapter you willearn to recognize cardiovascular system disorders and to perform the interventionsthat can assist in restoring its function. CHAPTER 2 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM The respiratory system interacts with cells in the body to exchange oxygen and car-bon dioxide, enabling the oxygenation of all cells in the body. In this chapter youwill learn which diseases and disorders can disrupt the respiratory system, how torecognize these conditions, and what steps you can take to assist in curing the res-piratory system problems. CHAPTER 3 IMMUNE SYSTEM Remember the last time you experienced a bad cut. The site of the injury becameswollen and red and you might have felt feverish. This happened because yourimmune system was trying to heal the wound by attacking the microorganisms thatwere invading your body. However, the abilities to fight off disease and to heal awound are compromised when the immune system malfunctions. In this chapter youwill learn about immune system disorders and what actions the nurse can perform toassist in the patient's recovery, CHAPTER 4 HEMATOLOGIC SYSTEM The hematologic system produces and circulates blood cells throughout the body. Anydisorder of this system jeopardizes the functioning of every organ in the body. Thisxvi Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystifiedchapter explores the hematologic system and its common disorders and discusses how to care for patients who experience them. CHAPTER 5 NERVOUS SYSTEM The nervous system is the body's command center that receives impulses and sendsan appropriate response. In this chapter you will learn about the disorders that causethe malfunctioning of the nervous system and the interventions that mitigate neuro-logical problems. CHAPTER 6 MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM The musculoskeletal system is the body's superstructure that provides strength andmovement. In this chapter you will learn about disorders of the musculoskeletal sys-tem and the treatments for restoring its functions. CHAPTER 7 GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM The body receives nourishment and excretes waste through the gastrointestinal system.Any disorder of the GI tract might disrupt the body's ability to store carbohydrates,lipids, and protein, all of which are used to energize cells. You will learn about thesedisorders and what to do about them in this chapter. CHAPTER 8 ENDOCRINE SYSTEM The endocrine system is the body's messenger. It turns on and off messages that directthe action of organs. Endocrine disorders cause chaos, as messages become misdi-rected. Endocrine system disorders and what to do about them are presented in thischapter. CHAPTER 9 GENITOURINARY SYSTEM Reproductive organs and the urinary system come from the same embryologicalorigin, which is why they are combined in the genitourinary system. Disruptions ofthe genitourinary system are caused by a variety of disorders, some associated morewith one gender than the other. In this chapter you will learn about these disordersand the treatments which can correct them. xvii IntroductionCHAPTER 10 INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM Diseases and disorders of the Integumentary system expose the body to invasion of viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms because the primary defense\u2014the skin\u2014is disrupted. In this chapter, you will learn about these diseases and disorders anddiscover ways to mitigate them. CHAPTER 11 FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES Fluids and electrolytes must be in balance for the body to properly function. Animbalance causes the body to compensate in ways that can have a rippling effectthroughout other systems. In this chapter you will learn about fluids and electrolytedisorders and how to intervene to restore their balance. CHAPTER 12 MENTAL HEALTH Disorders that affect the mind can interfere with daily activities and lead to self-destructive behaviors. In this chapter, you will learn about mental health disorders, how torecognize them, and steps that can be taken to minimize their influence on the patient. CHAPTER 13 PERIOPERATIVE Surgical intervention is a radical but, at times, necessary treatment for a patient's condition. However, surgery can expose the patient to a set of disorders that wouldotherwise be avoided if no surgery had occurred. You will learn about these dis-orders and how to handle them in this chapter. CHAPTER 14 WOMEN'S HEALTH The women's health chapter covers a multitude of conditions that affect women.Here you will learn how to recognize these conditions, the medication used to treatthem, and the interventions that can mitigate their ill effects on the patient. CHAPTER 15 PAIN MANAGEMENT Pain is associated with many disorders and must be successfully managed to re-duce its disruptive affect on the patient's well-being. You will learn the techniquesfor managing pain in this chapter. xviii Medical-Surgical Nursing DemystifiedABOUT THE AUTHORS Mary DiGiulio is an Adult Nurse Practitioner on the faculty in the School of Nursing at UMDNJ in Newark, NJ and in practice in Teaneck, NJ.

The heart pumps the blood tothe body where it delivers nutrients and oxygen, picks up waste products, and thenreturns to the heart. The heart has four chambers. The upper chambers are the atria; the lower cham- bers are the ventricles. In the middle, there is a septum, a wall that separates theright side of the heart from the left side of the heart. Atrioventricular (A V) valvescontrol the blood flow between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. The tri-cuspid valve is on the right side, while the mitral valve is on the left side betweenthe atria and the ventricle. The pulmonic valve controls the flow between the rightventricle and the pulmonary artery, while the aortic valve controls the flow betweenthe left ventricle and the aorta. Unoxygenated blood empties into the right atrium from the systemic circulation via the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava. As the right atrium contracts, thetricuspid valve opens, allowing the blood to flow into the right ventricle. With con-traction of the right ventricle, the pulmonic valve opens, allowing the unoxygenatedblood to enter the pulmonary artery to go to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Onceoxygenated, the blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary vein and enters theleft atrium. As the left atrium contracts, the mitral valve opens, allowing the bloodto flow into the left ventricle. As the left ventricle contracts, the aortic valve opens,allowing the blood to flow into the aorta and systemic circulation. The blood willreturn to the heart from the lower body via the inferior vena cava and from theupper body via the super vena cava. The actions on the right side and left side ofthe heart happen simultaneously. So when we listen to a normal heartbeat, thesounds we hear are the sounds of the valves closing. The mitral and tricuspid valvescreate the first heart sound (S1), while aortic and pulmonic valves create the sec-ond heart sound (S2). The electrical conduction system of the heart starts at the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is located in the right atrium. It initiates the heart beat, ranging between 60to 100 beats per minute, every day, for a lifetime. The electrical current travelsacross both atria, then converges on the atrio-ventricular (A V) node, where the cur-rent slows, allowing the atria to repolarize. The A V node is located in the superiorportion of the ventricular septum. In the bottom portion are located the right and leftBundle of His, which is a group of special cardiac muscles that sends an electricalimpulse to the ventricle to begin cardiac contractions. These end in the Purkinjefibers and spread out through the ventricles. The current passing through thesefibers causes ventricular contraction, forcing the blood from the right ventricle tothe lungs and from the left ventricle to the aorta, and thus, the systemic circulation.4 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Just the Facts Aortic Aneurysm WHAT WENT WRONG? A weakening in the wall of a portion of the aorta results in a balloon-like bulge as blood flows through the aorta. The blood flow within this bulging area of the aortabecomes very turbulent. Over time this turbulence can cause the dilated area toincrease in size, creating an aneurysm. The aneurysm can rupture causing a dis-ruption in blood flow to everything below the affected area, and may even resultin death. This is commonly due to atherosclerosis where fatty substances, cholesterol, calcium and the clotting material fibrin, referred to as plaque, build up in the innerlining of an artery resulting in thickening and hardening of the arteries. It may alsobe caused by degeneration of the smooth muscle layer (middle) of the aorta,trauma, congenital defect, or infection. The aneurysm may be found incidentallyon radiographic studies done for other reasons, or the patient may have developedsymptoms indicating that something was wrong, such as severe back or abdomi-nal pain, or a pulsating mass. Severe hypotension and syncope (fainting caused byinsufficient blood supply to the brain) may indicate rupture. PROGNOSIS Outcome will vary depending on size and location of aneurysm. Some patientshave aneurysms for months before a diagnosis is made, because they are asymp-tomatic. Treatment decisions will depend on the size and location of the aneurysm.Some patients with an aneurysm will have watchful waiting with periodic imag-ing to monitor the size of the aneurysm while other patients may need emergentsurgery. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic Abdominal pain Back pain that may radiate to posterior legs Abdominal pulsation15 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Diminished femoral pulses Anxiety Restlessness Decreased pulse pressure Increased thready pulse INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS An aneurysm will be displayed in a chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Swishing sound over the abdominal aorta or iliac or femoral arteries becausethe natural flow of blood is disturbed (bruit). TREATMENT Surgery to resect the aortic aneurysm by removing the section containing theaneurysm and replacing it with a graft. Administer antihypertensives, reducing the force of the pressure within theaorta to decrease the likelihood of rupture. Administer analgestics to treat patients who may be having pain from pres-sure on nearby structures (nerves, etc.) or tearing of the vessel. Administer oxycodone, morphine sulfate as needed to decrease oxygendemand. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion Risk for deficient fluid volume Acute pain Anxiety NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs\u2014look for changes in blood pressure or elevated pulseand respiratory rates. During aortic dissection the blood pressure (BP) mayinitially increase due to severity of pain. It may then become difficult to6 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified impossible to obtain both the BP and pulse in one or both arms because of blood flow disruption to the arm(s). The patient may go into shock quicklyif the aneurysm ruptures. Monitor cardiovascular system by checking heart sounds, peripheral pulses(upper and lower extremities), and checking for abdominal bruits, swishingsounds heard over the blood vessel when flow is disturbed. Measure intake and output. Hypovolemia is suspected if there is a low urine output and high specificgravity of urine. Palpate abdomen for distention or pulsatile mass. Abdominal distention, which is an enlarged abdomen, may signify imminentrupture of the aneurysm. Check for signs of severe decrease in blood or fluid (hypovolemic shock).The BP decreases as less blood circulates. Pulse rate increases as the hearttries to pump the blood faster to meet the oxygen demands of the body.Respiratory rate increases to meet oxygen needs while peripheral pulse sitesare harder to find as BP lowers. The further away the pulse is from the heart,the more difficult it will be to find; it will be harder to locate the dorsalispedis and posterior tibialis pulses earlier than the radial pulses. Pale, clammy skin will be present as circulation decreases. Severe back pain due to rupture or dissection. Anxiety due to uncertainty of what is happening. Restlessness due to anxiety, discomfort, and decreased oxygenation. Decreased pulse pressure due to less circulating volume, increased heart rate,and less filling time between heartbeats. Increased thready pulse. Limit patient's activity to a prescribed exercise and rest regimen. Be alert for decreased peripheral circulation. Numbness. Tingling. Decrease in temperature of extremities. Change in skin color in extremities. Absence of peripheral pulses. Reduce patient anxiety. Maintain a quiet place. Have the patient express his or her feelings.7 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Angina (Angina Pectoris) WHAT WENT WRONG? A narrowing of blood vessels to the coronary artery, secondary to arteriosclerosis, results in inadequate blood flow through blood vessels of the heart muscle, caus-ing chest pain. An episode of angina is typically precipitated by physical activity,excitement, or emotional stress. There are three categories of angina. Stable angina\u2014pain is relieved by rest or nitrates and symptoms are con-sistent. Unstable angina\u2014pain occurs at rest; is of new onset; is of increasing inten-sity, force, or duration; isn't relieved by rest; and is slow to subside in responseto nitroglycerin. Prinzmetal's or vasospastic angina\u2014usually occurs at rest or with minimalformal exercise or exertion; often occurs at night. Atherosclerotic heart disease occurs when there is a buildup of plaque within the coronary arteries. Angina is often the first symptom that heart disease exists.When the demand for oxygen by the heart muscle exceeds the available supply,chest pain occurs. PROGNOSIS Patients can often be managed with lifestyle modifications and medications tocontrol symptoms of angina. The most important factor is patient education.Patients need to understand the importance of their symptoms and when to seekmedical attention. The pain must be evaluated initially and whenever a change inpattern or lack of response to treatment occurs. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Chest pain lasting 3 to 5 minutes\u2014not all patients get substernal pain; it maybe described as pressure, heaviness, squeezing, or tightness. Use the patient'swords. Can occur at rest or after exertion, excitement, or exposure to cold\u2014due toincreased oxygen demands or vasospasm. Usually relieved by rest\u2014a chance to re-establish oxygen needs.28 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Pain may radiate to other parts of the body such as the jaw, back, or arms\u2014 angina pain is not always felt in the chest. Ask if the patient has had similarpain in the past. Sweating (diaphoresis)\u2014increased work of body to meet basic physiologicneeds; anxiety. Tachycardia\u2014heart pumping faster trying to meet oxygen needs as anxietyincreases. Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath (dyspnea)\u2014increased heart rateincreases respiratory rate and increases oxygenation. Anxiety\u2014not getting enough oxygen to heart muscle, the patient becomesnervous. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Electrocardiogram during episode: T-wave inverted with initial ischemia, which is reduced blood flow due toan obstructed vessel, usually first sign. ST-segment changes occur with injury to the myocardium (heart muscle). Abnormal Q-waves due to infarction of myocardium. Labs: troponins, CK-MB, which is an enzyme released by damaged cardiactissue 2 to 6 hours following an infarction, electrolytes. Chest x-ray to determine signs of heart failure. Holter monitoring: a portable EKG which the patient wears for 24 to 48 hours,giving that many hours of continuous cardiac monitoring. Coronary arteriography to determine plaque build-up in coronary arteries. Cardiac PET (positron emission tomography) to determine plaque build-upin coronary arteries. Stress testing to determine symptoms when at exercise or under pharmaco-logic stress. Echocardiogram or stress-echo to determine any motiondue ischemia. Cardiology consult. Nonemergent labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC) used to determine thegeneral health status of the patient, chemistry (provides information aboutthe status of eletrolytes, kidneys, acid/base balance, blood sugar and calciumlevels), Prothrombin Time (PT/INR), Activated Partial Throboplastin Time9 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System (PTT) (helps to detect and diagnose bleeding disorders and the effectiveness of anticoagulants), proBNP (BNP) measures the presence and severity ofheart failure. Cholesterol panel to evaluate risk. Increased risk for coronary artery disease with increased total cholesterol,increased low-density lipoproteins (LDL), increased triglycerides and de-creased high-density lipoproteins. (HDL). TREATMENT The goal of treatment is to deliver sufficient oxygen to the heart muscle to meet itsneed. When suspecting chest pain, always give oxygen as the first line of defense.Medications are used initially to treat symptoms and increase blood flow to theheart muscle. Medications are used for symptom control and cholesterol manage-ment in the long term. Cardiovascular interventions are used to maintain adequateblood flow through the coronary arteries. 2 to 4 liters of oxygen. Administer beta-adrenergic blocker\u2014this class has a cardioprotective effect,decreasing cardiac workload arrhythmia. Drugs nadolol, atenolol, metoprolol. Administer nitrates\u2014aids in muscle. Nitroglycerin\u2014sublingual tablets or spray; timed-release tablets. Topical nitroglycerin\u2014paste Aspirin for effect. Analgesic\u2014typically morphine intravenously during acute pain. The medi-cine is very fast-acting when given this way and will decrease myocardialoxygen demand as well as decrease pain. The following should be watched separately. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. This is a nonsurgical pro-cedure in which a long tube with a small balloon is passed through bloodvessels into the narrowed artery. The balloon is inflated, causing the artery toexpand. Coronary artery stent. This is a small, stainless steel mesh tube that is placedwithin the coronary artery to keep it open. Coronary artery bypass graph (CABG). This is a surgical procedure in whicha vein from a leg or an artery from an arm or the chest is removed and10 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified graphed to coronary arteries, bypassing the blockage and restoring free flow of blood to heart muscles. Low-cholesterol, low-sodium, and low-fat diet. NURSING DIAGNOSES Anxiety Decreased cardiac output Acute pain NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs\u2014look for change in BP, P, R; irregular pulse; pulsedeficit; when a discrepancy is found between an atrial rate and a radial rate,when measured simultaneously; pulse oximetry. Notify physician if systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mmHg. Nitratesdilate arteries to the heart and increase blood flow. You may have an order tohold nitrates if SBP <90 mmHg to reduce risk of patient passing out fromlack of blood flow to brain. Notify physician if heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute. Beta-adrenergicblockers slow conduction through the A V node and reduce the heart rate andcontractility. You may have an order to hold beta blockers if heart rate goesbelow 60; you should continuously monitor the patient's pulse rate. Assess chest pain each time the patient reports it. Remember PQRST (an acronym for a method of pain assessment) asfollows. Determine the p lace, quality (describe the pain\u2014stabbing, squeezing, etc.), radiation (does the pain travel anywhere else?), s everity (on a scale of 1 to 10), and timing (when it started and how long it lasts and what preceded the pain). Monitor cardiac status using a 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) while thepatient is experiencing an angina attack. Each time the patient has pain, anew 12-lead EKG is done to assess for changes, even if one was alreadydone that day. Record fluid intake and output. Assess for renal function. Place patient in a semi-Fowler's position (semi-sitting with knees flexed).11 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Explain to patient: Rest when pain begins to decrease oxygen demands. Take nitroglycerin when any pain begins\u2014it helps dilate coronary arter- ies and get more oxygen to heart muscle. Avoid stress and activities that bring on an angina attack. Call 911 if the pain continues for more than 10 minutes or as the patientis taking the third nitroglycerine dose (1 sublingual dose every 5 minutes,if BP allows, for maximum of 3 doses). Stop smoking! Smoking is associated with heart disease. Adhere to the prescribed diet and exercise plan. Lower cholesterol and fatintake to decrease further plaque build-up, and decrease excess salt intaketo help BP control. Slowly increase exercise to build up activity tolerance.Possibly exercise with cardiac rehabilitation. How to recognize the symptoms of a myocardial infarction: Pay attentionto chest pains as well as changes in patterns of pain and response to treat-ment. Be aware of changes in respiratory patterns, increase in shortnessof breath, swelling, and general feelings of malaise. Myocardial Infarction (MI) WHAT WENT WRONG? Blood supply to the myocardium is interrupted for a prolonged time due to the block-age of coronary arteries. This results in insufficient oxygen reaching cardiac muscle,causing cardiac muscles to die (necrosis). MI is commonly known as a heart attack. The area of infarction is often due to build-up of plaque over time (atheroscle- rosis). It may also be due to a clot that develops in association with the athero-sclerosis within the vessel. Patients are typically (not always) symptomatic, but somepatients will not be aware of the event; they will have what is called a silent MI. PROGNOSIS The outcome depends on the coronary artery that is affected. The earlier the per-son enters the healthcare system, the better the prognosis is, because emergencymeasures will be available for otherwise fatal arrhythmias.312 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified There is a better outcome for patients who receive adequate medical attention and make appropriate lifestyle changes post-myocardial infarction. Cardiac reha- bilitation can help patients make these changes safely. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Chest pain that is unrelieved by rest or nitroglycerin, unlike angina Pain that radiates to arms, jaw, back and/or neck Shortness of breath, especially in the elderly or women Nausea or vomiting possible Maybe asymptomatic, known as a silent MI, which is more common in dia-betic patients Heart rate >100 (tachycardia) because of sympathetic stimulation, pain, orlow cardiac output Variable blood pressure Anxiety Restlessness Feeling of impending doom Pale, cool, clammy skin; sweating (diaphoresis) Sudden death due to arrhythmia usually occurs within first hour INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS EKG. T-wave inversion\u2014sign of ischemia. ST-segment elevated or depressed\u2014sign of injury. Significant Q-waves\u2014sign of infarction. Decreased pulse pressure because of diminished cardiac output. Increased white blood count (WBC) due to inflammatory response to injury. Blood chemistry: Elevated creatine kinase MB (CK-MB)\u2014usually done serially, the num-bers will rise along a predetermined curve to signify myocardial damageand resolution. Elevated troponin I- and troponin T-proteins elevated within one hour ofmyocardial damage. Less than 25 ml/hr of urine output due to lack of renal blood flow.13 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System TREATMENT Treatment is focused on reversing and preventing further damage to the myo- cardium. Early intervention is needed to have the best possible outcome. Thrombo-lytic therapy is instrumental in reducing mortality. A three-hour time window isideal for maximizing benefit. Medications are used to enhance blood flow to theheart muscle while reducing the workload of the heart. Supplemental oxygen isused to help meet myocardial oxygen demand. Data from coronary angioplastyand percutaneous coronary intervention (stenting) of an occluded artery have beenimpressive. Following the acute management, the patient will have to make lifestylechanges\u2014altering diet and exercise, stopping smoking, and so on. Administer oxygen, aspirin. Administer antiarrhythmics because arrhythmias are common as are con-duction disturbances. Amiodarone. Procainamide. Electrical cardioversion for unstable ventricular tachycardia. In cardioversion,an initial shock is administered to the heart to re-establish sinus rhythm. Administer antihypertensive to keep blood pressure low. Hydralazine. Percutaneous revascularization. Administer thrombolytic therapy within 3 to 12 hours of onset because it canre-establish blood flow in an occluded artery, reduce mortality, and halt thesize of the infarction. Alteplase. Streptokinase. Anistreplase. Reteplase. Heparin following thrombolytic therapy. Administer channel blockers as they appear to prevent reinfarctionand infarctions. Verapamil. Diltiazem. because they reduce the duration of is-chemic pain and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation; decreases Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Propranolol. Nadolol. Metroprolol. Administer analgesics and de- crease myocardial oxygen consumption. Morphine. Administer nitrates by dilation of blood vessels; helpsto lower BP. Nitroglycerin. Place patient on bed rest in CCU. No bathroom privileges. Bedside commode only. Low-fat, low-caloric, low-cholesterol diet. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective tissue perfusion Decreased cardiac output NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor: Cardiovascular\u2014look for changes or instability in pulse, heart sounds,murmur. Respiration\u2014look for changes, fluid in lung fields, shortness of breath. EKG during attack\u201412-lead during any episode of pain. EKG continuous monitoring for arrhythmias. Vital signs\u2014check for changes in BP, pulse quality, peripheral pulses. Pulse-oximetry monitoring. Explain to the patient: Change to a low-fat, low-cholesterol, low-sodium diet. The difference between angina pain and myocardial infarction pain. When to take nitroglycerin. Medication. When to call 911.15 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Smoking cessation. Limit activities. Need for cardiac rehabilitation. Stress reduction. Lifestyle changes such as increase in exercise, diet changes. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) WHAT WENT WRONG? Cholesterol, calcium and other elements carried by the blood are deposited on the wall of the coronary artery resulting in the narrowing of the artery and the reduc-tion of blood flow through the vessel. This impedes blood supply to the heart mus-cle. These deposits start out as fatty streaks and eventually develop into plaque thatinhibits blood flow through the artery. Elevated cholesterol levels and fat intakecan contribute to this plaque build-up, as can hypertension, diabetes, and smoking.When the plaque builds up within the artery, the heart muscle is deprived of oxy-gen and nutrients ultimately damaging the heart muscle. PROGNOSIS Lifestyle changes and medications can significantly impact the risks of the individ-ual. Dietary modification, activity, and medications can help to alter the diseaseprocess. Patients who continue with prior bad habits will continue with disease pro-gression. Risk factors include age, male gender, and family history. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic. Chest pain (angina) because of decreased blood flow to heart muscle and/orincrease in myocardial oxygen demand resulting from stress. Pain may radiate to the arms, back, and jaw. Chest pain occurs after exertion, excitement, or when the patient is exposedto cold temperatures because there is an increase in blood flow throughoutthe body, raising the rate.416 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Chest pain lasts between 3 to 5 minutes. Chest pain can occur when the patient is resting. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Blood chemistry: Increased total cholesterol. Decreased high-density lipoproteins (HDL)\u2014helps with reverse transport of cholesterol. Increased low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Electrocardiogram during chest pain: T-wave inversion\u2014sign of ischemia. ST-segment depressed\u2014sign of injury to muscle. The waves are depressed because of tissue injury. TREATMENT Treatment consists of risk factor modification, life style changes, medications, andrevascularization. Weight loss. Diet change: lower sodium, lower cholesterol and fat, decreased calorieintake, increased dietary fiber. Administer low doses of aspirin. Administer beta-adrenergic blockers to reduce workload of heart: metroprolol, propranolol, nadolol. Administer calcium channel blockers to reduce heart rate, blood pressure,and muscle contractility; helps with coronary vasodilation; slows A V nodeconduction. Administer nitrate if patient has symptomatic chest pains to reduce discom-fort and enhance blood flow to myocardium. Platelet inhibitors: dipyridamole ticlopidine17 breakdown of VLDL particles: gemfibrozil Bile acid binding resins binds bile acid intestine: colestipol Nicotinic acid reduces production of VLDL: niacin NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Activity intolerance Impaired gas exchange NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs\u2014signs of hypertension, irregular heart rate Monitor electrocardiogram\u2014look for end organ damage, signs of heart disease Monitor labs\u2014periodic lipid panel, liver function for patients on statins Monitor for myalgias (muscle aches) Explain to the patient: Stop smoking Reduce alcohol consumption Change to a lower-fat, lower-cholesterol diet, as well as increased dietaryfiber intake Increase daily activity Weight reduction18 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Stress management Hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation programs Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) WHAT WENT WRONG? Large peripheral arteries become narrowed and restricted (stenosis) leading to the temporary (acute) or permanent (chronic) reduction of blood flow to tissues(ischemia). This is most commonly due to atherosclerosis (plaque on the innerwalls of arteries), but may also be caused by a blood clot (embolism), or from aninflammatory process. Severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease can lead to skinulceration and gangrene. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is more common inpatients with diabetes or hypertension, in older adults, in those with hyperlipi-demia, and in those who smoke, as these conditions can predispose to diminishedcirculation. Vascular disease that happens in one area of the body, e.g. coronaryarteries, is not an isolated process. The plaque build-up caused by long-term ele-vated cholesterol levels will happen throughout the body. The most common areaof involvement is the lower extremities. PROGNOSIS Patients typically have progressive disease. It is a chronic problem, getting worsewith age. Symptoms may not be present until there is a 50 percent or greater occlu-sion of the vessel. Suspect disease in patients who have risk for other cardiovasculardiseases. Medications can help to improve blood flow to the area and increasedactivity will improve exercise tolerance and quality of life. Vascular interventionmay be necessary as the disease progresses. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Femoral, popliteal arteries. Sudden pain in the affected area because of spontaneous muscle contrac-tions due to the reduced oxygenation of tissue. Intermittent claudication\u2014pain, numbness, and/or weakness with walk-ing due to increased oxygen demand of the muscle during activity.519 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Weak or absence of pulse in affected area because blood flow is reduced or blocked. Decreased temperature distal to the blockage because of restricted bloodflow. Pallor or patchy coloring (mottling) of affected area because of reducedtissue oxygenation. Dependent rubor (increased redness when legs are lower). Hair loss on extremities. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Doppler ultrasonography of affected area. Arteriography. Dye is injected into the affected artery enabling an outline ofthe artery and blockage to be seen in an x-ray. Ankle brachial index (ABI) helps to determine the amount of arterial insuf-ficiency. TREATMENT The goal of treatment is to maintain adequate blood flow to the area and avoid tis-sue damage. Patients are encouraged to maintain activity and reduce risks for dis-ease, such as smoking, as well as to control blood pressure and monitoring diabetes. Medical treatment: Exercise. Smoking cessation. Decrease in lipids, depending on what the labwork shows. Surgical treatment: Femoropopliteal bypass graft: A vessel from another part of the body isremoved and grafted to the affected artery, permitting blood to bypass theblockage. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: A catheter containing a balloon isinserted into the affected artery. The balloon is inflated, stretching the artery;this causes a healing response that breaks up plaque on the artery wall.20 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Atherectomy: A catheter containing a grinding tool is inserted into the affected artery and is used to grind plaque from the artery wall. Embolectomy: Surgical removal of a blood clot from the affected artery. Thromboendarterectomy: Surgical removal of atherosclerotic tissue from theaffected artery. Laser angioplasty: A laser-tipped catheter is inserted into the affected arteryto remove the blockage. Stent: A metal mesh tube is inserted into the affected artery to keep theartery open. Amputation: Surgical removal of the affected limb that contains gangrenecaused by low blood flow or complete blockage of blood to the affected limb. Administer antiplatelets medication to enhance blood flow to the lower ex-tremities. This helps to get blood through the vessels and alleviates symptoms. penoxifylline cilostazol aspirin clopidogrel dipyridamole ticlopidine NURSING DIAGNOSES Fear Ineffective tissue perfusion Risk for injury NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor most distal pulse to assure circulation exists. Compare bilateral pulses. Monitor temperature, color of affected area indicating tissue perfusion. Support hose. Check capillary refill. Administer anticoagulant (such as heparin, warfarin) as directed. Administer pain medication as directed.21 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Don't elevate leg or apply heat if occlusion affects the femoral or popliteal arteries. Elevation of the lower extremities makes it harder for the blood flow to getto the tissues. Avoid prolonged sitting, which increases the risk of compression to vessels(impeding blood flow to lower extremities) and increases risk of clot forma-tion in lower extremities. Explain to the patient: How to check pulses in the affected area if there is an absence of a pulse. Call the physician if the patient experiences numbness, paralysis, or pain. Don't wear tight clothes; avoid tight knee-high hose, which constricts atthe popliteal space; avoid tight waist bands; ensure wide shoe box. Change his/her lifestyle to reduce the risk of peripheral arterial occlusivedisease. The importance of regular examinations. Foot check daily for open wounds, redness. Regular visits to podiatrist. Regular consults to vascular MD. Cardiac Tamponade WHAT WENT WRONG? A large amount of liquid accumulates in the sack around the heart (pericardium),creating pressure on the heart that reduces the filling of ventricles with blood. Thisresults in a low volume of blood being pumped with each contraction. The accu-mulating pressure within the pericardium may be due to fluid, pus, or blood. Theend result is decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. The cause of tamponade may be trauma, postoperative, post-MI, uremia, or cancer. The fluid may develop rapidly or over time, depending on cause. Tamponadeis a life-threatening condition. The seriousness is related to the amount of pressurewithin the heart and the resulting decrease in ventricular filling. PROGNOSIS Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention, suchas drainage of the fluids. Stabilization occurs quickly once the fluid is removed and622 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified pressure is alleviated. If fluid recurs, surgery may be necessary. The prognosis depends on the etiology of the tamponade. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Neck vein distention\u2014accumulation of fluid within the pericardium causespressure on the heart, which prevents the venous return from the jugularveins. This causes distention, more pronounced on inspiration. Restlessness due to decreased oxygen to the brain. Muffled (dull) heart sounds on auscultation because it's harder to hear throughfluid. Pulsus paradoxus\u2014decrease of 10 mmHg or more in SBP during inspira-tion\u2014change in pressure within the chest during inspiration, resulting indecreased ventricular filling, decreased output, fall in SBP. Sweating (diaphoresis). Difficulty breathing (dyspnea). Tachycardia. Hypotension. Fatigue. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Echocardiograph: Ultrasound image of the heart to assess the heart's posi-tion, structure, and motion. Ventricle and atria are compressed. Fluid foundwithin pericardial sac. Cardiac catheterization. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged heart if large effusion present. Electrocardiogram used to rule out other cardiac problems. TREATMENT Treatment is directed at reducing the pressure on the heart from the accumulatingfluids in the pericardial sac. The following may be necessary to support and stabi-lize the patient.23 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Pericardiocentesis: A needle is inserted into the pericardium and fluid is aspi- rated or drained. Administer adrenergic agent\u2014increases heart rate and blood pressure. NURSING DIAGNOSES Anxiety Ineffective tissue perfusion Decreased cardiac output NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Assure adequate oxygenation. Cardiogenic Shock WHAT WENT WRONG? A drop in blood pressure and blood flow caused by the heart's inability to pumpblood as a result of a cardiac emergency, such as cardiac tamponade, myocardialischemia, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart that deterioratesthe heart muscle). Blood pools in the left ventricle, which causes a back up of bloodinto the lungs, resulting in pulmonary edema. Contractions increase to compensatefor the decreased cardiac output, causing an increase in demand for oxygen by the heart. However, the lungs are not oxygenating the blood sufficiently due todecreased blood flow; and therefore heart muscles are starved for oxygen. PROGNOSIS Treatment needs to find a balance between improving cardiac output and reducingoxygen needs and cardiac workload of the myocardium. This balance must beachieved while maintaining perfusion of the heart muscle. Prognosis depends onfinding and treating the underlying cause. Cardiogenic shock requires immediatetreatment, often before the cause is known.724 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Hypotension, because blood flow decreases below normal. Tachycardia, because the heart is trying to pump faster to maintain adequate blood flow to the body, or occasionally bradycardia, where the heart rate isless than 60 beats per minute due to myocardial damage. Arrhythmias\u2014when the heart muscle does not have enough oxygen itbecomes irritable, making arrhythmias more likely. Clammy skin, because oxygenation to tissues is reduced. Drop in skin temperature because of reduced circulation as a result ofhypotension. Urine output less than 30 ml per hour (oliguria) because the kidneys are notbeing perfused. Crackles heard in the lungs secondary to pulmonary edema, meaning fluidisbuilding up in lungs. Confusion due to poor perfusion. Distended jugular veins\u2014sign of fluid overload, inability of heart to managefluid coming into heart. Cyanosis of lips, peripheral extremities due to poor perfusion. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Chemistry\u2014check electrolytes, kidney function to ascertain kidney perfusion;calcium level is increased or decreased secondary to muscle contractility. Echocardiogram\u2014to look for ventricular rupture, pericarditis, or valve dys-function. Electrocardiogram: Q-wave enlarged due to heart failure. Elevation of ST-waves is a sign of ischemia. TREATMENT Treatment is based on medical support for the heart until etiology (cause) can bedetermined. In cardiogenic stroke, the stroke volume and the heart rate must be in-creased to keep the organs perfused. The effects of the following medications shouldaccomplish this.25 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Administer vasodilator\u2014dilates blood vessels (arterial and venous) to decrease the venous return to the heart and reduces the peripheral arterial resistance(what the heart has to pump against). Nitroprusside; nitroglycerin. Administer adrenergic agent\u2014to increase the heart rate and blood pressure: epinephrine. Administer inotropes strengthens the heart beat, improves peripheral vasoconstriction: dopamine dobutamine inammone milrinone Administer vasopressor decreases flow to all organs except the heartand brain: norepinephrine Provide supplemental oxygen\u2014may need to be via intubation. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective tissue perfusion Decreased cardiac output NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs\u2014look for changes in BP, P, R. Monitor heart sounds. Monitor Swanz Ganz catheter is a catheter placed into the pulmonary arteryto check for pressures in the heart, vessels, and lungs. Test capillary refill. Monitor arterial blood gas to learn pH, acidosis or alkalosis, bicarb level. Monitor respiratory status\u2014due to poor perfusion, these patients are in res-piratory distress; mechanical ventilation may be needed. Place the patient on bed rest.26 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor intake and output of fluids\u2014look for adequate renal perfusion. Without sufficient cardiac function, the patient will not have enough bloodflow to the kidneys to get adequate filtration. Explain to the patient: Which symptoms to be aware of and when to call the doctor. Take rest periods. Call the physician if there are signs of fluid overload\u2014weight increase,shortness of breath, fatigue, dependent edema. Record weight each day and call the physician, nurse practitioner, orphysician assistant if there is an increase of 3 lbs (1.4 kg). Change to a low-sodium, low-fat diet. Cardiomyopathy WHAT WENT WRONG? The middle layer of the heart wall that contains cardiac muscle (myocardium)weakens and stretches, causing the heart to lose its pumping strength and becomeenlarged. The heart remains functional; however, contractions are weak, resultingin decreased cardiac output. Most are idiopathic and not related to the major causesof heart disease. The three types of cardiomyopathy are: 1. Dilated cardiomyopathy (common): The heart muscle thins and enlarges, which leads to congestive heart failure. Progressive hypertrophy and dilata-tion result in problems with pumping action of ventricles. 2. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The ventricular heart muscle thickens, result- ing in outflow obstruction or restriction. There is some blood flow present. 3. Restrictive cardiomyopathy (rare): The heart muscle becomes stiff and re- stricts blood from filling ventricles, usually as a result of amyloidosis, radi-ation, or myocardial fibrosis after open-heart surgery. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is variable. Sudden cardiac death is a possible outcome in dilated orhypertrophic cardiomyopathy; arrhythmia is often a precursor to sudden death. 827 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic\u2014Many clients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are asymptomatic. Those with signs do not present until their mid-twenties. Dyspnea\u2014The most frequent symptom is shortness of breath due to increasepressure in the lungs. The heart may not sufficiently relax resulting in higherpressure and a backup of blood into the lungs. Angina\u2014Clients experience chest pain related to increase oxygen demandof the extra heart muscle and due to thick, narrowing coronary blood vesselswithin the heart's wall Syncope\u2014Fainting is caused by heart arrhythmias related to the inability ofthe cardiac muscle to conduct electrical impulses. Sudden death\u2014Young adults are at risk of sudden death during physicalexercise resulting from ventricular fibrillation, which is a cardiac arrhythmia. Abnormal heart sounds Murmur, which is the sound of turbulence results from abnormal blood flow S3, which is a third heart sound commonly heard in heart failure. S3 is asoft sound made by the vibration of the ventricular wall when the ventri-cle fills too rapidly. S3 is heard after the S2 heart sound and is best foundover the apex of the left ventricle, which is the fourth intercostal spacealong the mid-clavicular line S4, which is the heart sound heard before the S1 heart sound is the result of the heart being too stiff. This is vibration of the valves and the ven- tricular walls when the atria contracts and the ventricles fill. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Chest x-ray (CXR) shows enlarged heart, pulmonary congestion. Echocardiography shows left conduction LVH. Left ventricular hypertrophy shows as a broad QRS wave, usually in leads4, 5, and 6 because of high voltage. Cardiac catheterization\u2014to measure chamber pressures, cardiac output, ven-tricular function, but is often unable to add to information that has alreadybeen received from echocardiogram.28 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Exercise testing may show poor cardiac function not evident in a resting state. TREATMENT Treatment is based on the specific cause. Avoiding the offending drug/treatment isimperative. Manage the underlying disease and provide cardiac support; however,few therapies can halt the process of cardiomyopathy. Change to a low-sodium diet. Beta adrenergic blockers\u2014cause the heart to beat slowly, allowing moretime ventric-ular filling channel blockers\u2014reduced cardiac by increasing milrinone digoxin (for dilated risk. Myectomy\u2014incision into septum and removal of tissue. NURSING DIAGNOSES Activity intolerance Impaired gas exchange Decreased cardiac output29 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System NURSING INTERVENTION Place patient in a semi-Fowler's position for comfort, which eases respira- tory effort. Record intake and output of fluids. Monitor vital signs to assess for increased respiratory rate, arrythmias. Monitor electrocardiogram to look for changes from previous tracing. Explain to the patient: fluids restriction may be necessary as heart failure isa concurrent disease with dilated cardiomyopathy. Record daily weight and call physician if weight increases 3 lbs (1.4 kg). No smoking or drinking alcohol. No straining during bowel movements. Increase exercise. Endocarditis WHAT WENT WRONG? Microorganisms, usually bacteria, enter the blood stream and attach to the innerlining of the heart (endocardium) and heart valves, resulting in inflammation.Ulceration and necrosis occur when microorganisms cover the heart valves. Thisusually occurs in patients with rheumatic heart disease or degenerative heart dis-ease; those with recent instrumentation (IV , GU, and respiratory procedures) ordental procedures; and IV drug users. PROGNOSIS The prognosis depends on both the organism (as some are more virulent than others)and the degree of damage to the heart. Myocarditis may recur. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Chills/fever\u2014due to infectious process. Petecchiae on the palate, beneath the fingernails, osler nodes (painful, dis-colored, raised areas on fingers and feet), Janeway lesions (painful lesions onpalms and soles).930 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Fatigue\u2014due to infectious process. Murmurs\u2014new or changing. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Blood culture and sensitivity test. Three sets of cultures one hour apart to determine the specific organism so treatment can be started. Echocardiogram is used to detect vegetation on valves or heart valves dam-aged by the microorganism, and also to determine which valves are involved. Transesophageal echocardiogram offers a view to detect vegetation on heartvalves or view heart valves damaged by a microorganism. Chest x-ray to look for underlying cardiac abnormality and pulmonaryinfiltrate. TREATMENT Treatment depends on the underlying infectious agent. Empiric treatment shouldbe started while waiting for culture results. Outcomes are affected by possiblevalvular destruction, emboli, and growth of bacteria on the valves or endocardium. Administer antibiotics based on the result of culture and sensitivity test. Valve replacement may be necessary if damage to valves is significant. Bed rest to decrease demand on heart. NURSING DIAGNOSES Decrease cardiac output Risk for injury Activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor for signs of heart failure due to increased stress on heart due toaltered valve function. Breathing difficulties (dyspnea).31 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Heat rate >100 beats per minute (tachycardia). Crackles in lungs. Neck vein distention. Edema, usually of extremities; may also be of sacrum in bed-bound patients. Weight gain. Monitor for embolism\u2014a piece of vegetation from valve may have brokenoff into circulation. Blood in the urine (hematuria). Pain with each breath due to pulmonary embolism. Monitor renal function. Increased BUN (blood urea nitrogen). Increased creatinine clearance. Decreased urine output. Prophylatic antibiotics before, during, and after medical procedures thatexpose the patient's blood to microorganisms\u2014otherwise it is easy for micro-organisms to enter bloodstream and colonize the heart valves. Explain to the patient: Need to complete antibiotic course. Can have a relapse. Call the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant if the patientdevelops fever, chills, night sweats. Heart Failure [Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)] WHAT WENT WRONG? In congestive heart failure, the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to maintain adequate circulation. This results in a backup of blood and the extra pressure maycause accumulation of fluid into the lungs. Heart failure is primarily due to prob-lems with ventricular pumping action of the cardiac muscle, which may be causedby diseases such as myocardial infarctions (heart attacks), endocarditis (infection inthe heart), hypertension (high blood pressure), or valvular insufficiency.1032 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified When disease affects primarily the left side of the heart, the blood will back up into the lungs. When disease affects primarily the right side of the heart, the sys- temic circulation may be overloaded. When the heart failure becomes significant,the whole circulatory system may be compromised. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Extra heart sounds (normal heart sounds were described in the beginning): S3: Soft sound caused by vibration of the ventricular wall caused by rapidfilling. Heard after S2 heart sound. Heard over the apex of the left ventri-cle, fourth intercostal space along the mid-clavicular line. Best heard whenpatient lies on left side. Usually indicates heart failure. S4: Vibration of valves and the ventricular walls during the second phaseof ventricular filling when the atria contract. Heard before S1, in the samelocation as S3, usually due to a \"stiff heart.\" Murmur: Sounds of turbulence caused by blood flow. Heard anywherearound the heart. Congestive heart failure Fatigue Syncope Chest pain PROGNOSIS Medications can help the heart to pump more efficiently. Some medications areused for disease management; others are used for symptom control. Monitoringdietary intake of sodium and fluids can also help with symptom control. Heart failure is the main complication of heart disease, produced by an abnor- mality of pumping function. The heart is unable to carry blood effectively to meetmetabolic needs. The resulting problems include acute left ventricular dysfunctionusually due to arrhythmias and myocardial infarction, and chronic failure due tofluid overload, usually in valvular heart disease. Heart failure is a compromise of any of the following: Contractility of the muscle Heart rate Ventricular preload Ventricular afterload33 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System While most hearts can tolerate some changes in the above items, some diseased, older hearts may not be able to do so; heart failure results. Treatment results of early disease are usually good. Long-term prognosis can be variable, depending on the severity of the disease and associated conditions. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Early: Basilar rales from fluid overload Nocturia Exertional dyspnea Fatigue Positive hepatojuglar reflux from liver congestion S3 heart sound Mid: Cough Orthopnea Discomfort in right upper abdomen Cardiac rales Edema Cardiomegaly Late: capillary permeability INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS produced when the ven- stretched. EKG may show signs of ischemia (T-wave inversion), tachycardia, or extra-systole (extra beats). CBC may show anemia\u2014Hgb less than 12 in female, less than 14 in male;HCT; less than 3 times the Hgb. Chemistry may show renal problems, electrolyte disturbance.34 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Chest x-ray. Left-sided heart failure: Pulmonary congestion because of accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Enlarged left ventricle (LVH) because of the increased stress on the heart to pump blood. Right-sided heart failure: Pulmonary congestion because of accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity (pleural effusion). Enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) because of the increased stress on theheart to pump blood. TREATMENT Treatment is aimed at the underlying disease, i.e. ischemia, valve defects, arrhyth-mias. Excreting volume with diuretics, supplemental oxygen, use of medicationsto reduce workload of heart muscle, peripheral vascular resistance (afterload), andvenous return to the heart (preload) may all be used. Dietary indiscretions may bea contributing factor, i.e. too much salt, too many calories. Administer diuretics for symptom control resulting in patient comfort byreducing blood Furosemide, bumetanide, metolazone, hydrochlorothiazide, imbalance\u2014these medications Administer ACE inhibitors to decrease afterload. Captopril, enalapril, lisinopril. Administer beta blockers, which help to raise ejection fraction, and decreaseventricular size. Administer inotrope to strengthen myocardial relieve dyspnea: nitroprusside, nitroglycerin ointment. Administer anticoagulants in patients with severe heart failure, as they havea propensity to develop thrombus and emboli; those with concurrent atrialfibrillation will also need anticoagulation. Reduce fluids as fluid overload is a causative factor in CHF.35 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System High Fowler's position to ease breathing and enhance diaphragmatic excursion. Supplemental oxygen to meet increased demand of myocardium. Low-sodium diet to prevent additional fluid retention. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Decreased cardiac output Excess fluid volume NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs and look for changes. Record fluid intake and output\u2014weigh daily to assess for fluid overload. Position patient in semi-Fowler's position to ease breathing. Administer oxygen as ordered because it helps to decrease workload of heart. Tell the patient: Eat foods low in sodium to avoid fluid retention. (For these patients, thereis no such thing as \"low-salt\" cold cuts.) Raise legs when sitting to lessen dependent edema. Call the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant if experienc-ing fluid retention, such as a weight gain of several pounds in 1 to 2 days. Hypertension (HTN) WHAT WENT WRONG? Pressure inside blood vessels exceeds 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolicon more than one occasion resulting from a primary disease or no known cause.These are the classifications of hypertension is defined as 130/80 or higher PROGNOSIS The vast majority of patients have primary hypertension, or high blood pressure, that is not caused by other disease. Patients are typically asymptomatic and needto understand the importance of treatment to avoid long-term complications. Endorgan damage can affect the heart, kidneys, brain, or eyes. Adequate control ofblood pressure is possible with medications and lifestyle modification, but theseneed to be maintained for the long term, often for the rest of the patient's life.Many patients will ultimately need to be on multiple medications to achieve ade-quate blood pressure control. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic Headache Dizziness INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Blood pressure readings higher than 140/90 mmHg on at least three occasions. Ventricular hypertrophy depicted on EKG or chest x-ray. Blood test to look for associated cardiovascular risks. High cholesterol\u2014often associated with hypertension. Check electrolytes for imbalance\u2014sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2. Monitor BUN and creatinine for renal function, a sign of impaired organdamage. Chemistry to check for diabetes mellitus. TREATMENT Treatment is aimed at decreasing the risk of CV A, CAD, heart failure, renal disease,and other long-term sequelae of hypertension. Risk factors need to be assessed:37 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Smoking Dyslipidemia\u2014elevated cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, low HDL Diabetes Age greater than 60 Men and postmenopausal females Family history Non-pharmacologic interventions are tried first, then medications are pre- scribed. There is a four-step treatment plan: Step 1: Lifestyle changes Reduce caloric intake and exercise to reduce weight Low-sodium diet No smoking Reduce alcohol intake Reduce caffeine intake Step 2: Begin medication Administer diuretics to reduce circulating blood volume: furosemide, spironolactone, hydrochlorothazide, metroprolol, atenolol Calcium ACE to inhibit the rennin angiotensin aldosterone system. In diabetes, ACE inhibitors also delay the progression of renal disease. enalapril, lisinopril, benazepril, captopril, fosinopril, quinapril, perin-dopril Step 3: Increase dosages of currently administered medication Step 4: Combination of agents in above classes Multiple drugs may be needed to control blood pressure38 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING DIAGNOSES Imbalanced nutrition: more than the body requires. Knowledge deficit Excess fluid volume NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor blood pressure with multiple readings\u2014lying, sitting, and standing, bilateral both arms. Record fluid intake and output. Reduce stress by providing a quiet environment. Explain to the patient: No smoking\u2014smoking contributes to cardiovascular disease, raising blood pressure. Change to a low-sodium and low-cholesterol diet\u2014salt adds to elevatedblood pressure in some patients by contributing to fluid retention; lowercholesterol intake lowers risk for associated hyperlipidemia. Reduce alcohol intake\u2014reduces risk for end organ damage from alcoholintake. Reduce weight\u2014decreased risk for obesity, better BP control with betterweight control. Exercise. Call physician when BP is elevated. Side effects of medications. Hypovolemic Shock WHAT WENT WRONG? Rapid fluid loss causes inadequate circulation resulting in inadequate perfusionof organs. Hypovolemic shock can be caused by external hemorrhage, fluids1239 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System moving in the body from vessels into tissue (third spacing), or dehydration. External hemorrhage is loss of blood, plasma, fluids and electrolytes, due totrauma, GI bleed, vomiting, or diarrhea. Third spacing can result from ascites orpancreatitis. PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on the etiology of the low volume; there may occasionally bemore than one reason. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Hypotension because blood volume in the body is decreased Urine output less than 25 ml/hour because less blood is perfusing the kid-neys, causing decreased urinary output Heart rate >100 (tachycardia), because the heart attempts to compensate forthe decreased volume Cold skin, because of peripheral vasoconstriction due to decreased volume Restlessness, agitation; may be seen due to poor perfusion of the brain INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Blood tests. CBC anemia. Chemistry to look at volume as depicted by the creatinine and BUN. Coagulation studies. Type and cross-match for blood transfusion. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Decrease pH\u2014if not perfusing well, acidosis will occur. Metabolic acidosis\u2014byproducts of metabolism will accumulate. Increase partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and decrease partialpressure of arterial oxygen due to poor perfusion.40 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Treatment depends on severity of symptoms. As always, maintaining open airway, breathing, circulation, and fluid resuscitation is of vital importance. After stabi-lization, the focus is on determining and treating the cause of the shock. Control bleeding\u2014CBC, stool guaiac test, [to find hidden (occult) blood instool], assess for bleeding. Replace fluid\u2014proper fluid replacement depends on the etiology of the shock;IV fluid and/or blood products are the choices. NURSING DIAGNOSES Deficient fluid volume Ineffective tissue perfusion Decreased cardiac output NURSING INTERVENTION IV using 14G catheter (16 or 18 gauge also adequate if not able to obtain 14;use largest possible): Lactated Ringer's solution (which contains electrolytes) or normal saline(0.9 percent). Blood replacement\u2014type-specific or type O negative, which is the uni-versal donor type. Monitor every 15 minutes: Blood pressure. If systolic lower than 80 mmHg, then increase oxygenflow rate. Vital Signs every 15 minutes. Measure urine output each hour with indwelling urinary catheter. Increasefluid rate if urine output is less than 30 ml/hour. Be alert for signs of fluidoverflow. These include, but are not limited to, crackles in the lungs anddyspnea. Assess for cool, pale, clammy skin, indicating hypovolemic shock. Explain to the patient: What caused the hypovolemia and how to avoid a recurrence. The purpose of the treatment.41 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Myocarditis WHAT WENT WRONG? Inflammation of the heart muscle is usually caused by infection, most often viral. Infection can also be caused by alcohol poisoning from chronic alcohol abuse,drugs, or diseases that can result in the degeneration of heart muscle. This reducesthe ability of the heart to pump blood efficiently, leading to congestive heart failure. PROGNOSIS Outcomes vary depending on the etiology. Improvement depends on the stressesof the causative disease. Some resolve spontaneously; others develop dilated car-diomyopathy, CHF. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fever because of infectious process Tachycardia Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) because left side dysfunction leads to CHF Chest pain Hear sounds: S3 gallop due to fluid overload INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS EKG. ST-segment changes due to inflammatory changes in the heart due to theirritability of the myocardium from an infectious process. Endomyocardial biopsy to determine a specific organism and the presence ofinflammation after infection has resolved. CXR\u2014cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram to assess cardiac size and function. Labs\u2014CK, MB, and troponins because of cell injury and death.1342 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Treatment is directed at the causative factor(s). Occasionally treatment may in- clude support for CHF and antiarrhythmics, if needed. Administer antiarrhythmics to stabilize an irritable heart: quinidine procainamide NURSING DIAGNOSES Hyperthermia Decreased cardiac output Activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Temporarily limit the patient's activities to decrease stress on the heart. Provide bedside commode. Monitor for: Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) because fluid overload. Heart rate >100 beats per minute (tachycardia) because infection or inflam-mation may increase the heart rate. No competitive sports. Return to normal activities slowly once physician approves. Pericarditis WHAT WENT WRONG? The membrane that encloses the heart (pericardium) is inflamed. Pericarditis iseither acute or chronic. Acute pericarditis is most commonly associated with viral infections. Upper respiratory symptoms are not uncommon and can occur a few weeks prior to the1443 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System onset of pericarditis. Pericarditis may be caused by any infectious agent, AMI, malignancy, autoimmune diseases, or drug reaction. PROGNOSIS Outcome of acute pericarditis is often self-limited, resolving in two to six weeks.Patients are typically treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) todecrease the inflammation of the pericardium. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Acute: A grating heart sound heard (pericardial friction rub) due to friction frominflammation between the layers surrounding the heart Sudden sharp pain over the precordium (mid- to lower sternum area) radi-ating to the neck, shoulders, back, and arm Pain decreases when the patient leans forward, sits up Teeth pain, anxiety, myalgias Difficulty breathing (dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea) Arrhythmias Chronic: Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), ascites because of liver congestion Increased fluid retention due to ineffective pumping Pericardial friction rub INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increase WBC and sed rate (the rate at which red blood cells settle in a testtube. A high rate indicates inflammation), thyroid studies, renal function, Rhfactor, ANA complement. May see and the ven- tricular wall due to effusion; also shows fluid in the pericardial space. CXR may show fluid in spaces. TREATMENT Treatment is directed at resolving the underlying etiology. Pericardiocentesis is done to remove fluid from the pericardial sac to relieve pressure on the heart or for diagnostic testing. A long cardiac needle is insertednear the xiphoid process and fluid is aspirated during careful cardiac monitoring. Pericardial biopsy Administer corticosteroids inflammation of anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs to decrease in-flammation of the pericardium and provide for pain relief. Aspirin, indomethacin. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Decreased cardiac output Risk for activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Place the patient in full Fowler's position to ease breathing. Explain to the patient: He/she will recover. Slowly resume daily activities. Plan for rest periods during the day due to fatigue. Perform coughing and deep breathing exercises\u2014patient may have beenavoiding deep breathing due to discomfort.45 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Pulmonary Edema WHAT WENT WRONG? Fluid builds up in the lungs as a result of ineffective pumping of blood by the heart as a result of left-sided heart failure, AMI, worsening of heart failure, or volumeoverload. The patient experiences hypoxia, which is insufficient oxygen supply totissues, caused by decreased oxygenation of the blood. Several noncardiac issuesmay lead to pulmonary embolism. PROGNOSIS Poor heart function results in fluid overload, which results in further diminishedcardiac function, causing marked dyspnea. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Difficulty breathing even when sitting upright (because of the fluid in thelungs) Rapid breathing: greater than 20 breaths per minute (tachypnea), because thebody is trying to get more oxygen Frothy sputum with a tinge of blood due to capillary permeability Cyanosis Cool, clammy skin because the body is diverting blood flow from theperiphery Restlessness and fear due to lack of oxygenation Distended jugular vein due to increased pressure within chest Crackles, wheezing heard in the lungs as the air moves through the fluid INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Oxygen saturation under 90 percent. CXR: aleveolar fluid, large heart. Echocardiogram to determine ejection fraction percentages in the heart.1546 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Treatment may continue at home unless a worsening change in condition merits hospitalization. Immediate treatment of heart failure, while searching for underly-ing correctable conditions, is necessary. Administer supplemental oxygen, which increases arterial pO2. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Administer morphine, which lowers left atrial pressure, decreases myocar-dial oxygen demand, lowers anxiety, and relieves pain. Administer diuretics to remove excess fluid: furosemide, bumetanide, meolazone Administer cardiac glycosides to increase contractions of the heart: digoxin Administer cardiac to strengthen the heart: dobutamine milrinone Administer ventricular filling pressures: isosorbide dinitrate NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Anxiety Excess fluid volume NURSING INTERVENTION Place the patient in full Fowler's position to enhance air exchange anddiaphragmatic movement, sitting with legs dangling over sides of bed. Monitor cardiovascular function for changes in heart sounds, extra sounds,murmurs. Monitor respirations for changes in lung sounds, chest expansion.47 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Check oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry). Record fluid intake and output. Weigh the patient daily. Call physician if patient gains 2 lbs daily. Call physician if BUN and creatinine increase. Record characteristics of sputum. Explain to the patient: Call the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant if the patient detects fluid overload: weight gain, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pains. Call 911 if in respiratory distress. Decrease sodium in diet. Sleep with head elevated i.e. three pillows, or blocks under head of bedframe. Raynaud's Disease WHAT WENT WRONG? Blood flow to the extremities decreases as peripheral arteries narrow fromvasospasm when exposed to cold or emotional stress. This results in the fingers,toes, nose, and ears blanching to a pale shade and/or turning blue and red as bloodflow decreases. It usually occurs bilaterally, often sparing the thumbs, and beginsto resolve with warming of affected areas. Raynaud's is a benign condition usuallycontrolled by avoidance of underlying factors, i.e., cold and stress. SecondaryRaynaud's can be seen with other disorders, mostly inflammatory and/or connec-tive tissue diseases. This is more common in older men, usually involves thehands, and can have other complications. PROGNOSIS Prognosis for primary Raynaud's is good. Symptoms may be controlled by avoid-ance or by medications. In secondary Raynaud's, long-term ischemic complica-tions may develop, such as loss of fat pads of fingers, gangrene due to diminishedsensation, and propensity to develop frostbite. 1648 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Discoloration of extremities progressing from pale, to blue, and then red because of decreased blood flow Tingling and numbness in the extremities because of poor perfusion INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Vasospasm is detected in an arteriograph. Labwork to look for underlying disease process\u2014CBC may show anemia;sed rate (ESR), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), antinuclear antibody (ANA) (theseautoimmune tests will be positive). TREATMENT Treatment is outpatient and consists of avoidance of aggravating factors and mayneed medication for primary, and treatment of underlying disorders and ischemiain secondary. Administer calcium channel blockers to ameliorate symptoms: diltiazem nifedipine Administer vasodilators to aid in blood flow. Avoid cold and stress because this may causes vasospasms. Avoid smoking because it causes vasoconstriction. Surgical removal of a part of a sympathetic nerve (sympathectomy) becauseit can eliminate symptoms. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for injury Risk for peripheral neurovascular dysfunction Ineffective tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTION Teach patient to wear mittens rather than gloves when exposed to the coldbecause it allows for air flow around fingers to hold body heat.49 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Explain to the patient: Stop smoking. Avoid cold. Inspect skin regularly for cracks and treat immediately to prevent infections. Moisturizers. Rheumatic Heart Disease WHAT WENT WRONG? Rheumatic fever usually results from a prior upper respiratory infection with group A streptococcus. It may lead to permanent valve disease and cardiac dam-age, with the mitral valve being more commonly affected. PROGNOSIS Prognosis of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) depends on the amount of damagedone to the valves. When progressive valve disease occurs in the mitral valve, it isimperative to recognize the early onset of atrial fibrillation, to ensure early initia-tion of anticoagulation to prevent emboli. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS A new murmur of insufficiency S3 Joint pain because of the inflammation Increased temperature greater than 100.3\u00b0F because it may signify infection Carditis\u2014chest pain, heart failure, friction rub INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increase in cardiac enzymes to look for other causes of chest pain Positive C-reactive protein, ESR which are elevated in inflammation Increase in WBC because it may be of infectious origin Echocardiogram to assess for damage to valves1750 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Treatment of RHD is based on the severity of the valve damage. Valve replace- ment may be necessary. If a fibrillation (contracting of the heart) is present, ensureadequate anticoagulation with an International Normalized Ratio between 2 and 3.Rheumatic fever prophylaxis may be required; antibiotics are recommended forprevention of recurrent episodes. Administer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication to decrease inflam-mation and pain: aspirin indomethacin Administer antibiotics if an infectious process is confirmed: erythromycin penicillin Repair or replacement of heart valves due to irreparable damage. Antibiotic prophylaxis for unsterile procedures\u2014usually penicillin; if aller-gic to penicillin, clindamycin is usually the drug of choice. Anticoagulation if atrial fibrillation. NURSING DIAGNOSES Decrease cardiac output Activity intolerance Risk for infection NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor for difficulty breathing (dyspnea) and hacking, nonproductive cough,because these are signs of heart failure. Determine if patient is allergic to penicillin. Monitor for infection because rheumatic fever may recur: Red, sore throat with pain when swallowing. Swollen cervical lymph glands. Headache. Temperature greater than 100\u00b0F.51 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Explain to patient: Anticoagulation use, interference with foods and medications, need for frequent lab monitoring. Avoid contact with anyone who has a respiratory tract infection. Maintain good dental hygiene. Call the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant if detect signsof heart failure: shortness of breath, weight gain, nonproductive cough. Return to normal activities slowly. Thrombophlebitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Throbmophlebitis is the inflammation of a vein as a result of the formation ofone or more blood clots (thrombus). It is usually seen in the lower extremities,calves, or pelvis. This may be the result of injury to the area, may be precipitatedby certain medications or poor blood flow, or may be the result of a coagulationdisorder. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is usually good unless embolization, or moving of the clot, occurs. Itmay move to the lung or brain, which can be life-threatening. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS May be asymptomatic Edema, tenderness, and warmth in the affected area as part of an inflamma-tory response Palpable tender cord Positive Homan's sign\u2014pain on dorsiflexion of the ipsalateral foot\u2014is anunreliable sign Cramping because blood flow to the area is impaired due to the presence ofthe clot1852 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified If the clot dislodges from the vein and travels to the lung, other symptoms will develop: Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) when the clot has traveled to the lungs Rapid breathing >20 breaths per minute (tachypnea) because of a clot inthe lungs Chest pain in the area of clot Crackle sounds in lungs in the area of clot INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Ultrasound determines if blood is flowing to the affected area. Photoplethysmography depicts any defects in venous filling in the affectedarea. Lab work to look for clotting disorders. TREATMENT Patients with large deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or with comorbidities (a diseasecoexisting with, and often impacting on, another disease present), and/or advancedage should be managed in the hospital. Treatment consists of anticoagulation toprevent further occurrences. Administer anti-inflammatory medication to decrease the inflammation withinthe vessel aspirin, indomethacin Administer anticoagulant medication to prevent the clot from becominglarger: heparin, warfarin, dalteparin, enoxaparin Limit activity initially to diminish risk of moving clot\u2014bedrest with bath-room priviledges NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective tissue perfusion Acute pain Impaired skin integrity53 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor breathing because changes in respiratory status can signal that a clot has dislodged and moved to the lung. Monitor labs because the patient is receiving anticoagulants. Monitor fortherapeutic effect. Apply warm moist compresses over affected area because it enhances bloodflow to area. Explain to the patient: Report signs of bleeding\u2014anticoagulant may be too much. Report signs of clotting\u2014pain in affected area, shortness of breath\u2014patient may have underlying clotting disorder. Move about frequently when allowed\u2014discourages chances of develop-ing another clot. Don't cross legs\u2014avoid constriction of lower extremity vessels. Don't use oral contraceptives\u2014increases risk of clot formation. Support hose. Elevate affected area. Atrial Fibrillation WHAT WENT WRONG? Uncoordinated firing of electrical impulses in the wall of the atria (upper chambersof the heart) causes the heart to quiver instead of beating regularly, resulting in inef-fective contractions. This is usually due to an abnormality in the electrical system ofthe heart. Blood is ineffectively pumped to the ventricles (lower chambers of theheart) and may result in not enough blood being pumped throughout the body.Usually the heart beats rapidly; however, this is not always the case. Atrial fibrilla-tion (also called AF or \"a fib\") is the most common chronic arrhythmia and is notlife-threatening on its own, but increases the patient's risk for blood clots and strokes. PROGNOSIS The arrhythmia usually goes away once the cause of atrial fibrillation is identi-fied and treated. If left untreated or if it returns, there is a risk of stroke and othercomplications.1954 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic Irregular pulse Feeling faint (near syncope) Palpitations Lightheadedness Dyspnea INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Electrocardiogram will show irregularities characteristic of the disease: QRS complexes are of irregular duration and structure. PR interval barely noticeable. Erratic, low-voltage, or absent P-waves. Echocardiogram to look for structural abnormalities. Thyroid function tests as hyperthyroidism can lead to atrial fibrillation. TREATMENT Treatment is directed towards restoring the regular heart rate and rhythm. If the atrial fibrillation is less than 72 hours old, chemical or electrocardioversion is endeavored. Electrocardioversion, or shocking the heart, often restores normalsinus rhythm. If greater than 72 hours, anticoagulation is begun as the risk ofthromboembolism is great. Administer antiarrhythmics once patient stabilizes\u2014these medications maybe effective in restoring a regular rhythm and also for in long-term therapy: amiodarone digoxin diltiazem verapamil Unstable patient: Synchronized cardioversion is a treatment that involves anelectrical shock delivered to the heart, which is synchronized with the R- orS-wave of the EKG, in an attempt to restore coordinated firing of electricalimpulses.55 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Install a pacemaker. If atrial fibrillation is the ongoing rhythm, warfarin therapy will be initiated to reduce the risk of emboli. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Decreased cardiac output Ineffective tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor for signs of decreased blood flow to tissues or organs (hypoperfusion)because decreased cardiac output, as indicated by these symptoms, can occuras a result of atrial fibrillation: Decreased pulse pressure. Cool extremities. Altered mental state. Rapid resting heart rate. Alternating breathing between deep and shallow. Increased BUN. Prepare for synchronized cardioversion, if patient is unstable. Assess for life-threatening arrhythmias. Assess for signs of drug toxicity and withhold if the patient is toxic\u2014i.e.,seizures, respiratory arrest, arrhythmias. Limit patient's activities to reduce cardiac workload. Explain to the patient: The need for warfarin therapy, as well as monitoring of INR, diet modifi-cations, use of NSAIDs, and aspirin. The importance of regular examinations to ascertain for any changes inrhythm. Call the physician if the patient feels light-headed or dizzy, as this can bea symptom of a change in rhythm. Avoid ethanol, caffeine, nicotine as they can trigger an arrhythmia.56 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Proper care and restrictions if the patient has a pacemaker\u2014frequent monitoring of the pacemaker battery, who will follow up with the cardi-ologist, and so on. Frequency depends on the type of pacemaker and thecardiologist. Asystole WHAT WENT WRONG? Asystole is defined as no cardiac electrical activity. This causes ventricles to stopcontractions, leading to no cardiac output and no blood flow. Cardiac standstill is amedical emergency. Treatment must be started immediately, while simultaneouslyattempting to understand the etiology of a non-beating heart. Asystole is a criterionfor certifying that the patient is dead. Asystole may be caused by disruption in theelectrical conduction system, causing life-threatening drug a drugoverdose\u2014usually PEA (pulseless electrical activity)\u2014reverse overdose or treat. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is poor unless the heart can be started. The longer asystole continues,the more tissue is lost. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS No pulse Cyanosis Apnea No palpable blood pressure INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Electrocardiogram\u2014P-, QRS-, T-waves are barely noticeable or absent. Arterial blood gases.2057 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Lab work\u2014CBC, electrolytes, drug levels, coagulation studies. No atrial or ventricular rhythm on the electrocardiogram. TREATMENT Treatment consists of restarting the heart and, when that has occurred, determin- ing the cause of the asystole. Basic Life Support (CPR) should optimally be startedwithin two minutes (once asystole is established, CPR should be initiated imme-diately when asystole is detected, and Advanced Cardiac Life Support within eightminutes. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Advanced Cardiac Life Support. Oxygen. Start IVs to maintain access. Transcutaneous pacing, where electrodes are placed on the front and back ofthe chest while high current is delivered to the patient to pace the ventricles. Endotracheal intubation. Administer buffering agent antiarrhythmics to control arrhythmia: atropine epinephrine NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Decreased cardiac output Ineffective tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTION Begin CPR. Prepare to administer medication per physician's order or protocol.58 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Explain to the patient: Note: If asytole exists, patient is not conscious. Talk to family members if they are present. Refer to Basic Life Support (BLS) protocol. Call the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant if the patientexperiences dizziness. The importance of regular examinations. Ventricular Fibrillation WHAT WENT WRONG? Electrical impulses, that trigger the ventricles to contract, fire erratically. This causesthe ventricles to quiver and prevents regular effective contractions, resulting in thedisruption of blood flow to the body. The usual causes are ventricular tachycardia,electrolyte disturbances, myocardial infarction, electric shock, and drug toxicities. PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on how long it takes to establish a beating heart. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS No pulse Breathing is stopped (apnea) No palpable blood pressure INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Electrocardiogram: Chaotic ventricular rhythm. QRS irregular and wide. P-wave barely noticeable. TREATMENT Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS).2159 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Defibrillation (refer to ACLS protocol). Endotracheal intubation to manually compress a bag to squeeze air (referred to as bag valve mask ventilation) and thus, oxygen, into the lungs. Administer buffering agent to correct acidosis: lidocaine epinephrine bretylium procainamide NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Decreased cardiac output Ineffective tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTION Begin CPR (place on monitor, BP, P, R, pulse-oximetry. Perform defibrillation, if certified. Prepare to administer medications per physician's order or protocol. Explain to the patient: Note: Patient is more than likely noncoherent. Speak to family. Call the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant if the patientexperiences dizziness. The importance of regular examinations. Ventricular Tachycardia WHAT WENT WRONG? Abnormal electrical impulses within the ventricles cause the heart to contract morethan 160 beats per minute. This results in inadequate filling of the ventricles with2260 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified blood between beats; subsequently, less blood is pumped throughout the body than during normal contractions. Ventricular tachycardia (called \"V tach\") often occurs after CAD, mitral valve prolapse, and other myocar-dial disease. PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on the duration of the arrhythmia, and prompt response.Recurrent V tach signals a poor prognosis. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Unconscious Apnea or diminished breathing Pale, diaphoretic skin Dizziness because less oxygen is reaching the brain Hypotension because blood flow is increased to a rate that reduces timeavailable to oxygenate tissues Weak pulses due to poor perfusion INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Arterial Blood Gas (ABG). Electrolytes. Unusual QRS. No P-wave. Ventricular tachycardia may suddenly start and stop depending on the irri-tability of the heart. Ventricle contractions greater than 160 beats per minute.61 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System TREATMENT Treatment consists of establishing a regular rate and rhythm. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation if pulse is absent (refer to ACLS: pulseless V tach requires defibrillation). Advanced Cardiac Life Support if pulse is absent. Endotracheal intubation. Oxygen. is discharge that is synchronizedwith the R- or S-wave of the QRS complex to restore coordinated firing ofelectrical impulses. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Decreased cardiac output Ineffective tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTION Begin CPR if pulse is absent. Prepare to administer medication per physician's order or protocol. Explain to the patient the necessity of follow-up. Call the physician if the patient experiences dizziness. The importance of regular examinations.62 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Aortic Insufficiency(AI) WHAT WENT WRONG? Leakage of the aortic valve causes blood to flow back into the left ventricle. This results in increased blood volume in the left ventricle, causing it to dilate and be-come hypertrophic, thus reducing blood flow from the heart. The usual cause isincompetent cusps or leaflets of the valve, from endocarditis, valve structuralproblems, connective tissue disorders, rheumatic heart disease, hypertension, arterio-sclerosis, and other conditions. PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on the severity of the valve damage and the acuteness of thesymptoms in the patient. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) because of ineffective pumping Fatigue Orthopnea Palpations because the heart is irritable due to improper blood flow INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS X-ray shows an enlarged left ventricle. Echocardiogram confirms the left ventricle is enlarged and the valve is work-ing inefficiently. TREATMENT Treatment is based on the gravity of the symptoms of the patient. Aortic valve replacement or repair. Administer anticoagulant medication following surgery to prevent thrombusaround the aortic valve:2363 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System heparin warfarin enoxaparin NURSING DIAGNOSES Anxiety Decreased cardiac output Activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Place patient in a high Fowler's position to facilitate breathing. Oxygen. Pain management. Monitor for: Pulmonary edema because of backflow to the lungs. Thrombus because a foreign object (valve) is in place, and may cause clotting. Arrhythmias because the heart may be irritable secondary to surgery. Weigh the patient daily to be aware of fluid overload. Explain to the patient: Schedule rest periods during the day. Restrict diet to low-sodium and low-fat foods. Mitral Insufficiency WHAT WENT WRONG? Leakage of the mitral valve causes blood to flow back from the left ventricle intothe left atrium. As a result, blood might flow back into the lungs. Mitral regurgi-tation is due to an incompetent valve, damaged from rheumatic fever, CAD, orendocarditis.2464 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS The prognosis may be chronic with stabilization of symptoms, or acute, usually after myocardial infarction, leading to valve replacement. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Orthopnea due to the pressure rising into the atria, causing backflow into thelungs. Fatigue because of an ineffective heart. Systolic murmur at the apex, S3 gallop. Left ventricular hypertrophy\u2014the size of the ventricle can reflect the amountof regurgitation. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Echocardiogram shows the underlying etiology of the insufficiency. Cardiac catheterization depicts the flow through the mitral valve; can mea-sure amount of regurgitation as well as pressures in the chambers. TREATMENT Patients with chronic, stable disease may be managed for years without symptoms,or their symptoms may be under control with medication. Others may require sur-gery, again, based on the symptoms. Ventricular damage may occur before symp-toms present, so frequent monitoring is indicated. Administer vasodilators to reduce flow by lowering systemic vascularresistance. Administer anticoagulant medication following surgery valve: heparin warfarin enoxaparin Mitral valve repair or replacement. 65 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System NURSING DIAGNOSES Anxiety Decreased cardiac output Activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Place patient in a high Fowler's position to facilitate breathing. Monitor for: Pulmonary edema because of fluid overload. Thrombus because of a prosthetic valve. Arrhythmias because the heart may be irritable during and after surgery. Intake and output to monitor fluid balance. Weigh the patient daily to check fluid overload. Explain to the patient: Schedule rest periods during the day. Restrict diet to low-salt and low-fat foods. Mitral Stenosis WHAT WENT WRONG? In mitral stenosis, scar tissue secondary to rheumatic fever forms on the mitral valve. This causes it to narrow, increasing resistance to blood flow between the leftventricle and left atrium, which means the heart needs to pump harder to maintainblood flow. PROGNOSIS Mitral valve stenosis may be asymptomatic for years, never needing attention.However, eventually symptoms may occur and progress, necessitating interven-tion. Medication may be enough, or surgical intervention may be necessary.2566 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Murmur at apex Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) on exertion Fatigue because of a poorly functioning heart Weakness because the heart is working inefficiently Palpations because the heart needs to work harder to pump blood INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Cardiac catheterization depicts the flow through the mitral valve. X-ray shows enlarged left atrial and left ventricle. EKG depicts left atrial hypertrophy, exhibiting as broad, notched P-waves in lead II with negative deflection of the P-wave in lead V1. TREATMENT Mitral stenosis is generally a progressive disease and treatment is directed at main-taining function. When necessary, mitral replacement is indicated. Most of thesepatients need endocarditis antibiotic prophylaxis, which is administering anti-biotics to prevent a bacterial infection occurring before invasive procedures anddental cleaning. If atrial fibrillation occurs, anticoagulation is indicated. Medication to stabilize symptoms. Administer anticoagulant medication following surgery to warfarin dalteparin enoxaparin Mitral valve repair or replacement. NURSING DIAGNOSES Anxiety Decreased cardiac output Activity intolerance67 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System NURSING INTERVENTION Place patient in a high Fowler's position to ease breathing. Monitor for: Pulmonary edema because it may be a complication of surgery. Thrombus because of a prosthetic valve. Arrhythmias because of an irritated heart; patient may feel palpitations, anxiety. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) to monitor for oxygenation, acidosis, alkalosis. Weigh the patient daily to determine fluid balance. Explain to the patient: Signs and symptoms to look for and to report changes in condition. Schedule rest periods during the day. Restrict diet to low-sodium and low-fat foods. Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) WHAT WENT WRONG? The mitral valve bulges back into the left atrium, allowing blood to flow back-wards from the left ventricle into the left atrium. This is a common problem and isnot considered a serious condition. It is often congenital. PROGNOSIS Most patients with MVP are unaware they have it until symptoms start occurring.Often it is an incidental finding on an echocardiogram. A large majority of pa-tients require no treatment other than endocarditis prophylaxis during dental andunsterile procedures. Some patients progress with their symptoms, developing arrhythmias and requiring medications. Severe MVP may require mitral valve repairor replacement. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic because the valve leaflets do not bulge greatly Palpations because the valve is not operating properly2668 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Systolic click and/or late systolic pain Fatigue Syncope Dyspnea INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS EKG may be normal or show an atrial arrhythmia (irregular P-waves), left atrial/ventricular enlargement (broad P-, QRS-waves). Chest x-ray is usually normal, unless left chambers are large (in late disease). TREATMENT Treatment of MVP is determined by the severity of the symptoms. Most patientsrequire endocarditis antibiotic prophylaxis. Administer antiarrhythmic medications Administer anticoagulant medication after valve replacement to preventthrombus around the aortic valve. Ensure patient understands the need for daily, life-long anticoagulation ther-apy once a mechanical valve is (Lovenox) Mitral valve repair or replacement. NURSING DIAGNOSES Anxiety Decreased cardiac output Activity intolerance69 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System NURSING INTERVENTION Place patient in a high Fowler's position to facilitate breathing. After surgery, monitor for: Pulmonary edema to look for blood backflowing into lungs. Heart failure to assess for a poorly functioning heart. Thrombus because of a prosthetic valve. Arrhythmias because the heart may be irritated after surgery. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) to check for adequate oxygenation and acid/base balance. Weigh the patient daily to assess for fluid overload. Explain to the patient proper recovery from major surgery: Schedule rest periods during the day. Restrict diet to low-sodium and low-fat. Tricuspid Insufficiency WHAT WENT WRONG? Leakage in the tricuspid valve causes a backflow from the right ventricle into theright atrium. This results in increased pressure in the atrium and higher resistanceto blood flowing from veins, resulting in enlargement of the right atrium. This mayoccur from an anatomic problem, but usually occurs from right ventricular over-load (in turn caused by left ventricular overload). It may also occur due to an infe-rior myocardial infarction, or damage from endocarditis. PROGNOSIS If the underlying problem can be resolved, the insufficiency may subside. If reso-lution does not occur, tricuspid valve repair or replacement may be necessary. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) due to backflow into the lungs Fatigue because the heart is working inefficiently2770 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Jugular venous distention due to overload the right atria Hepatic congestion from backflow S3 murmur upon inspiration INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS X-ray shows enlarged right ventricle and right atrium because of volume overload. Echocardiogram depicts prolapsed tricuspid valve and enlarged right side ofthe heart. EKG depicts enlarged right ventricle and right atrium, characterized by broadP- and QRS-waves. TREATMENT Correct any underlying heart disease to reduce pressure on the right atrium, ven-tricle, and thus, the valve. Administer anticoagulant medication following surgery warfarin dalteparin enoxaparin Tricuspid valve repair or replacement. NURSING DIAGNOSES Anxiety Decreased cardiac output Activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Place patient in a high Fowler's position to facilitate breathing.71 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Monitor for: Pulmonary edema because backflow to the lungs may occur. Heart failure to assess cardiac function. Thrombus because of a prosthetic valve. Arrhythmias because the heart may be irritable. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG )to assess for adequate oxygenation, acid/base balance. Weigh the patient daily to look for fluid overload. Explain to the patient what symptoms to look for. Schedule rest periods during the day. Restrict diet to low-sodium and low-fat foods. Crucial Diagnostic Tests Electrocardiograph (EKG,ECG) WHY IS IT GIVEN? The EKG is a graphic representation of the electrical activity of the heart in a non-invasive procedure. It shows a three-dimensional perspective of the electricalfunction of the heart. There are four common uses of an electrocardiograph. Theseare (1) to measure the heart for a short time period such as during a physical or anassessment; (2) ongoing monitoring using telemetry while the patient is an inpa-tient; (3) ambulatory (Holter) monitoring for a 24-hour period while the patientgoes about normal daily activities; (4) stress test. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? An electrical signal is generated each time the chambers of the heart contract.Small pads containing electrodes are placed on the surface of the skin to detectthe hearts electrical signal. Each electrode is connected with wires to an electro-cardiograph, which draws up to 12 different graphical representation of theelectrical signal. There are twelve electrodes used in a typical EKG: bipolar limbleads I, II, and III; augmented limb leads A VR, A VL, and A and precordialchest V6.72 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified WHAT TO DO? Typically a technician will perform the electrocardiograph and a physician or a nurse with advanced training will interpret the results of the test. The nurse should be able to recognize a normal sinus rhythm and abnormal rhythms that are life-threatening such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricularfibrillation. The nurse should be able to reattach electrodes. Teach the patient the following: The patient will not experience an electrical shock. The patient must lie still for several minutes if the electrocardiograph is doneduring a physical or assessment. The patient can move about if the electrocardiograph of the patient is ambu-latory or if the patient is an inpatient during monitoring. If ambulatory, the patient should keep an activity diary of his or her symptoms. If ambulatory, the patient should not operate machinery, including microwaveovens and electric shavers, nor should he or she bathe or shower whileattached to the electrocardiograph. If it is a stress test, the patient should wear appropriate attire for exercise andreport any discomfort during the test so proper assessment can be completedto determine the etiology of the discomfort. Cardiac Catheterization (Angiography) WHY IS IT GIVEN? This is an invasive procedure used to examine the coronary arteries and intra-cardiac structures, as well as to measure cardiac output, intracardiac pressures, andoxygenation HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? A radiopaque dye, which makes structures visible on x-rays, is injected through a catheter into the femoral artery in the patient's left leg or in the antecubital fossa, which is the crease of the arm); it then flows to the coronary arteries. The flow of the radiopaque dye is viewed and recorded using a fluoroscope, enablingthe physician to determine obstructions to the flow and the structures of the heart.73 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Chemistry to assess creatinine, BUN and creatinine clearance. These are tests to determine kidney function. Determine if the patient is allergic to seafood or iodine. If so, notify thephysician immediately because the patient might be also allergic to the radio-paque dye. Obtain written consent from the patient. Risks and benefits of the test needto be explained to the patient before commencing. Nothing by mouth (NPO) for 4 to 6 hours before the test to reduce the riskof aspiration. Explain the procedure to the patient and its possible side effects. These areflushing of the face, nausea, urge to urinate, and chest pain, which are usu-ally reactions to the dye. Record baseline vital signs, so to assess for changes. After the test: Assess for bleeding at the injection site since a major artery has been accessed.If there is bleeding, apply pressure until bleeding stops. Keep patient on bed rest for 8 hours, so as not to dislodge a clot from theartery used for the catheter. Keep pressure on injection site for 8 hours to ensure clotting at the site. If femoral artery is used, keep left leg straight for 8 hours to minimize riskof dislodging clot. If antecubital fossa used, keep arm straight for 3 hours to minimize risk ofdislodging clot. Monitor vital signs to assess for changes. Increase fluid intake to assist the kidneys in excreting the dye. Echocardiograph WHY IS IT GIVEN? An ultrasound of the heart provides a noninvasive examination of intracardiacstructures and blood flow.74 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Sound waves are directed to and deflected by the heart, causing an echo that is detected by the echocardiograph, which is interpreted by a physician. WHAT TO DO? Describe the procedure to the patient. The patient must lie still for 30 minutes during the test to ensure an accuratepicture of the structures of the heart. Nuclear Cardiology WHY IS IT GIVEN? These tests determine myocardial perfusion and contractility of the heart, ischemia,infarction, wall motion, and ejection fraction. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Radioisotopes are injected through the IV . The radiation detector monitors the flowof the radioisotope as it flows through the heart. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Obtain written consent from the patient to ensure he or she understands therisks of the test. Explain the test to the patient, emphasizing that the patient must lie still dur-ing the test. After the test: Determine if there is bleeding at the injection site. 75 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Digital Subtraction Angiography WHY IS IT GIVEN? Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) enables the physician to view arterial blood supply to the heart using an injection of radiopaque contrast material. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? The patient is injected with an intravascular contrast material containing iodine.Images of bone and soft tissue are viewed from fluoroscopy through the use of acomputer, enabling the physician to view the cardiovascular system. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Obtain written consent from the patient once risks and benefits have beenexplained. Explain the test to the patient, emphasizing that he or she must lie still dur-ing the test. After the test: Determine if there is bleeding at the injection site. The patient must drink 1 liter (1 quart) of fluid to aid the kidneys in excret-ing the dye. Monitor the patient's vital signs to assess for changes. Hemodynamic Monitoring WHY IS IT GIVEN? Hemodynamic monitoring measures cardiac output and intracardiac pressure.76 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? A balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into the pulmonary artery, usually through the femoral artery. It is able to measure pressures in the heart's various chambers andvessels. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Obtain written consent from the patient to ensure he or she understands risksand benefits. Explain the test to the patient. After the test: Determine if there is bleeding at the injection site. Determine if there is infection at the injection site, redness, warmth, swelling,or discomfort. Examine for complications: air embolus, arrhythmia, and clots. Assess fordecrease in respiratory effort, increase in respiratory rate, dyspnea. Chest X-ray WHY IS IT GIVEN? Chest x-rays are done to detect size and position of the heart and structural abnor-malities of the lungs. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? An x-ray machine directs x-rays through the chest and onto film positioned behindthe patient's back. As x-rays are directed to the patient, some are absorbed by thebody and others pass through to the x-ray film. Areas of the body that absorb x-rays appear light on the x-ray film. Dark areas on the film represent x-rays thatpassed through the body.77 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System WHAT TO DO? Explain the test to the patient and that the patient will be asked to hold his or her breath while the x-ray is taken. Before the test, remove all jewelry, zippers, hooks, and any metal on the part of the body being x-rayed. Blood Chemistry WHY IS IT GIVEN? This provides a profile of the patient's health, including: Electrolyte balance (sodium, potassium, function (BUN, creatinine). Liver function: (AST/ALT). are enzymes released when the liver isdamaged) Diabetes: (serum glucose) Cholesterol level: (CK) and CK isoenzymes (these are enzymes releasedif there is damage to the heart muscle), cardiac troponin levels (troponin is aprotein in cardiac and skeletal muscles), (an amyocardial infarction), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and LDH isoenzymes]These are enzymes released when cardiac tissue is damaged. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Three to five milliliters of blood is sampled. Different tests require different tubes.The abnormal results are: Electrolyte balance (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, magnesium, calcium,phosphorus) will be abnormal in fluid imbalance, acid base imbalance. Kidney function (BUN, creatinine) will be elevated in kidney disease. Liver function: (AST/ALT) will be elevated in liver disease. Diabetes: (serum glucose) indicated when fasting glucose is above 125.78 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Cholesterol level: (cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides). Numbers need to be low except for HDL; a higher number is better; abnormal numbers theseshow injury to cardiac muscle. WHAT TO DO? No exercise before sampling blood, as it may falsely elevate some numbers. NPO, if directed by the physician. Accurate measurements of triglyceridesand glucose require a fasting state. No IM injections before sampling. If an injection is necessary, then note thename of the medication, time, and dose and send it along with the sample tothe lab, as it may alter results. Check for bleeding at venipuncture site. Fast for 12 hours for serum glucose test. Fast for 12 hours for cholesterol tests to assure accurate triglyceride. Hematologic Studies WHY IS IT GIVEN? This provides a profile of the patient's blood, including: CBC count\u2014reports hemoglobin, hematocrit, and size and shape of red bloodcells (RBC) that help in oxygen transport. Their average lifespan is 120 daysand they are formed in the bone marrow. A test is often performed to assessanemia, shortness of breath, response to medication, hemorrhage, surgery,and trauma. WBC count\u2014shows the level of white blood cells in the current circulation.WBCs are responsible for fighting infection in the body. There are five sub-types of WBCs: neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and inflammation, allergicresponse, and parasitic infection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a nonspecific test to show infectionand inflammation.79 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System Coagulation studies (PTT), platelet These are bleeding time tests to indicate the patient' s clotting ability. Most interfere at some point in the clotting cascade. INR is used to monitor stable patientstaking warfarin. PT is used to help screen patients taking warfarin. Since PTis made in the liver, this test is also useful to monitor liver functions.Abnormalities in the PTT indicate defects in the patient's coagulation statusand with blood factors. Used to monitor heparin therapy. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Three to five milliliters is sampled. The abnormal results are: RBC count\u2014usual indication is to look for anemia. WBC count\u2014when elevated, it shows infection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\u2014shows inflammation when elevated. Bleeding (prothrombin time, thromboplastin (Hct) show the level of iron- and oxygen-carrying capability of the blood. WHAT TO DO? Check for bleeding at venipuncture site. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) WHY IS IT BEING TESTED? This determines the patient's ventilation, tissue oxygenation and acid-base status. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Three to five milliliters of blood is obtained from an artery. Usually the radial,brachial or femoral arteries are used. The abnormal results are: Increased pH shows metabolic alkalosis or respiratory alkalosis. Decreased shows loss. Increased pO2shows hyperventilation. Decreased pO2shows anemia, respiratory difficulties. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Explain to the patient that arterial sticks may be more uncomfortable than venous labwork performed by the phlebotomists. Provide the lab with information on whether or not the patient is receivingsupplemental or mechanical ventilation as well as on the amount of oxygenreceived or the setting of the ventilator as it may alter the results. After the test: Apply mechanical pressure to puncture site for 5 minutes. Apply pressure dressing to puncture site for 30 minutes once bleeding hasstopped. Monitor the puncture site for bleeding. Venogram WHY IS IT GIVEN? This x-ray test takes pictures of the blood flow through the veins. It is used to iden-tify and locate blood clots and to determine the condition of the valves in the veins. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? An iodine dye is injected into the vein, making the vein visible in a fluoroscope;this allows the physician to visualize the flow of venous blood. 81 CHAPTER 1 Cardiovascular System WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Assess latest chemistry to check on BUN, creatinine, and creatinine clearance. Determine if the patient is allergic to seafood or iodine. If so, notify thephysician immediately because the patient might be also allergic to thedye. Obtain written consent from the patient to assure adequate knowledge ofrisks and benefits. Explain the procedure to the patient and its possible effects. These are flush- ing of the face, nausea, urge to urinate, and chest pain, which may be a reactionto the dye. After the test: Check for bleeding at the injection site to assess for hemorrhage. If bleeding,apply pressure until bleeding stops. Check for infection at the injection site. Look for redness, warmth, and ooz-ing of purulent matter. Increase fluid intake to assist the kidneys in excreting the dye. Pulse Oximetry WHY IS IT GIVEN? This determines the abbreviated arterial oxygen saturation of the blood. The fullarterial oxygen saturation is determined by the arterial blood gas test. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? An infrared light passes through the patient's nail bed or skin. The amount ofinfrared light passing through determines the amount of arterial oxygen saturationof the blood. 82 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified WHAT TO DO? Clamp the sensor on the patient's finger over the nail bed, toe, ear lobe, or bridge of the nose. Make sure that the site is clean. Nail polish or artificial nails may interferewith the reading.

Dur- ing inspiration, air flows in through the nose and passes into the nasopharynx.87 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Air is then drawn through the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. The bronchi branches (bifurcates) right and left into smaller tubes called bronchioles that ter-minate in alveoli. The airways are lined with mucous membranes to add moistureto the inhaled air. There is a thin layer of mucous in the airways that helps to trapforeign particles, such as dust, pollen, or bacteria. Cilia\u2014small, hair-like projec-tions\u2014help to move the mucous with the foreign material upward so it can becoughed out. Alveoli are air-filled sacs containing membranes coated with surfactant. The surfactant helps the alveoli to expand evenly on inspiration and prevents collapseon exhalation. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged; a higher concentrationof gas moves to the lower area of concentration. A higher concentration of carbondioxide in the hemoglobin moves across the membrane into the alveoli and isexpired by the lung. Higher concentration of oxygen in the alveoli crosses themembrane and attaches to the hemoglobin which is then distributed by the circu-latory system throughout the body. Lungs are contained within a pleural sac in the thoracic cavity and operate on negative pressure. The visceral pleura is close to the lungs and the parietal pleurais close to the chest wall. There is a pleural space between these two layers thatcontains a small amount of fluid to prevent friction with chest movement on inspi-ration and expiration. Just the Facts Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) WHAT WENT WRONG? Patients develop acute respiratory failure. Lungs stiffen as a result of a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Fluid builds up in the tissue of the lungs (interstitium) and thealveoli. This fluid and stiffness impairs the lungs' ability to move air in and out(ventilation). There is an inflammatory response in the tissues of the lungs. Damageto the surfactant within the alveoli leads to alveolar collapse, further impairing gasexchange. An attempt to repair the alveolar damage may lead to fibrosis withinthe lung. Even as the respiratory rate increases, sufficient oxygen cannot enter the188 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified circulation (hypoxemia). Oxygen saturation decreases. Respiratory acidosis develops, and the patient appears to have respiratory distress. This is most commonly due to shock, sepsis, or as a result of trauma or inhala- tion injury. Patients may have no history of pulmonary disorders, also known as Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome. PROGNOSIS Early recognition and treatment is critical. Even with intensive treatment, ARDShas a mortality rate of 50 to 60 percent. Some patients will progress into a morechronic type of ARDS which has permanent lung changes. These patients mayrequire long-term mechanical ventilation. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Hypoxemia\u2014insufficient level of oxygen in the blood, despite supplementaloxygen at 100 percent. Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)\u2014increased need for oxygen to meet body'sdemand. The need for oxygen will increase as fluid builds up in the lungsand compliance worsens. Pulmonary edema\u2014fluid build-up in the lungs. Breathing rate greater than 20 breaths per minute (tachypnea)\u2014breathingbecomes faster in an attempt to get oxygen into the body. Decreased breath sounds\u2014harder to hear through fluid in alveoli; no airmovement in collapsed alveoli. Anxiety\u2014secondary to not getting enough oxygen. Rales (crackles) heard in the lungs\u2014air moving through fluid in alveoli andsmall airways on inspiration and expiration (not heard initially). Wheezing (rhonchi)\u2014inflammation develops or mucous is created. Thisnarrows the airways, creating a sound as the air travels through the narrowedairway. Restlessness\u2014due to decreased oxygen levels. Cyanosis\u2014due to lack of oxygenation. Accessory muscle use for respirations\u2014look for retractions between ribs(intercostal) and below the sternum (substernal).89 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Pulse oximetry shows lowered oxygen levels below 90 percent. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) show respiratory acidosis\u2014increased PaCO2 ( decreasing with x-ray\u2014both lungs show infiltrates within lung fields; \"whiteout\" or ground glass appearance. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) low to normal. TREATMENT Bedrest. Endotracheal intubation. Mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or con-tinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Administer anesthetic to ease comfort insertion of endotracheal tube: propofol Administer neuromuscular blocking agent\u2014used when patients are on me-chanical ventilation to avoid patient working against the action of the venti-lator. These drugs allow respiratory muscles to rest: pancuronium, vecuronium Administer diuretics to help decrease excess fluid in lungs: furosemide, ethacrynic acid, bumetanide Administer H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor to decrease gastric acid.This will decrease likelihood of a stress ulcer in the stomach or aspiration ofgastric acid into the lung: ranitidine, famotidine, to clot formation: and to decrease myocardial oxygendemand: morphine Administer steroids to decrease inflammatory response in hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone90 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Administer exogenous surfactant: beractant Administer antibiotics for respiratory or systemic infections. Ideally selected based on results of culture and sensitivity (C&S) of sputum. May be given to cover likely infectious organism pending results of C&S. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective breathing pattern Impaired gas exchange Ineffective tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor WBC count: Elevation of WBC with infection, inflammation. Decrease in WBC in a patient who is immune-compromised or who has a viral infection. Monitor hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) for anemias. Monitor PT, PTT, and INR for coagulation abnormalities; monitor heparindosing. Record intake and output of fluid: Monitor for signs of renal insufficiency or failure (decrease in urinary out-put less than 30 ml/h) and monitor BUN and Creatinine. Monitor for possible fluid overload\u2014more fluid going in than comingout. Patient may end up in heart failure, compounding the fluid buildingup in the lungs. Weigh the patient daily\u2014inability to handle excess fluids, causing third spac-ing of fluids into interstitial spaces, increasing weight and causing edema. Change position at least every 2 hours to prevent pressure build-up, causingskin breakdown. Avoid overexerting the patient during treatment\u2014patient will tire easily andwill have problems with increased oxygen demands. Also provide rest peri-ods during activities.91 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Explain to the patient: The importance of doing coughing and deep-breathing exercises\u2014after coming off the ventilator the patient needs to move adequate air in and outof the lungs. Coughing helps to rid the lungs of any remaining fluid. How to identify the signs of respiratory distress, any sign that symptomsmay be returning: shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, rapid breath-ing, cyanosis, restlessness, or anxiety. Asbestosis WHAT WENT WRONG? Asbestos fibers enter the lungs, causing inflammation in the bronchioles and in thewalls of the alveoli. After inhalation, the fibers settle into the lung tissue. Fibrosisdevelops and ultimately pleural plaques form. The changes within the lung resultin a restrictive lung disease. The damage to the lung causes impairment in breath-ing and air exchange. PROGNOSIS It may take a decade or longer from the time of exposure before symptoms beginto develop. Some patients have worked in occupations known for asbestosis ex-posure (mining, shipyards, fireproofing, and construction before the mid-1970s),for 10 or 15 years prior to symptom development. There is an increased risk oflung cancer (mesothelioma) in patients with history of asbestosis exposure, espe-cially if the patient has also smoked. Mesothelioma may develop 2 to 4 decadespostexposure. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) on exertion and at rest due to changes in thelung tissue Chest pain or tightness due to changes within the lung tissue and restrictiveair movement292 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Dry cough due to irritation within the lungs Frequent respiratory infections due to changes within the lung, increasing susceptibility to infection Respiration greater than 20 breaths per minute (tachypnea) due to decreasedvital capacity Rales or crackles when listening to breath sounds INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Chest x-ray to reduce chance of illness. Lungs show linear opacities, irreg-ular opacities. Opacities are increased tissue density on the lung indicatingfibrosis or pleural plaque. CT scan shows opacities indicating increased tissue density of fibrosis orpleural plaque. Arterial blood gas shows decreased oxygen due to restrictive pattern ofrespiration. Pulse oximetry shows decreased pattern. Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) shows a restrictive pattern, decreased vitalcapacity. TREATMENT There is no specific treatment for asbestosis, nor is there a cure. Flu vaccine and pneumoccocal vaccine to reduce chance of illness. Oxygen therapy (1 to 2 liters per minute) to ease breathing discomfort by in-creasing available oxygen to meet body's needs. Administer antibiotics for exacerbations of respiratory symptoms\u2014to treatinfectious process based on results of culture and sensitivity study orempirically. NURSING DIAGNOSES Fatigue Impaired gas exchange Imbalanced nutrition: less than the body requires93 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System NURSING INTERVENTION Administer chest percussion and vibration to loosen and expel secretions. Explain to patient: How to avoid infections (reduced exposure to others with an infection and vaccines administered according to physician's orders). Proper use of oxygen therapy. Asthma WHAT WENT WRONG? The airways become obstructed from either inflammation of the lining of the air-ways or constriction of the bronchial smooth muscles (bronchospasm). A knownallergen, for example, pollen\u2014is inhaled, causing activation of antibodies that rec-ognize the allergen. Mast cells and histamine are activated, initiating a local inflam-matory response. Prostaglandins enhance the effect of histamine. Leukotrienes alsorespond, enhancing the inflammatory response. White blood cells responding to thearea release inflammatory mediators. A stimulus causes an inflammatory reaction, increasing the size of the bronchial linings; this results in restriction of the airways. There may be a bronchial smoothmuscle reaction at the same time. There are two kinds of asthma: Extrinsic asthma, also known as atopic, caused by allergens such as pollen,animal dander, mold, or dust. Often accompanied by allergic rhinitis andeczema; this may run in families. Intrinsic asthma, also known as nonatopic, caused by a nonallergic factorsuch as following a respiratory tract infection, exposure to cold air, changesin air humidity, or respiratory irritants. PROGNOSIS Triggers for the asthmatic patient can often be identified and avoided. Patients canlearn to check peak flow levels and manage symptoms in conjunction with theircaregiver. Well controlled asthma typically has temporary, reversible exacerba-tions that can be controlled with medications, often in an outpatient setting. With394 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified frequent attacks, a mild exposure to a known trigger will often be sufficient to exacerbate an attack. Patients who do not respond to medications or who use med-ications improperly may die during an asthma attack. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Wheezing initially present on expiration continues throughout respiratorycycle as inflammation progresses. Air has difficulty moving through the nar-rowed airways, making noise. Not all asthmatics will have wheezing. Asymptomatic between asthma attacks. Symptoms resolve when there is noinflammation present. Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) as airways narrow due to inflammation. Thisis typically progressive as inflammation increases. Respiration greater than 20 breaths per minute (tachypnea) as the bodyattempts to get more oxygen into the lungs to meet physiologic needs. Use of accessory muscles to breathe as the body tries harder to get more airinto the lungs. Tightness in the chest due to narrowing of the airways (bronchoconstriction). Cough. Tachycardia\u2014heart rate greater than 100, as the body attempts to get moreoxygen to the tissues. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Decreased oxygen and increased carbon dioxide present in arterial blood gasdue to inability to move adequate air, which results in inadequate gas exchange. Decreased force on expiration [either forced expiratory volume in the firstsecond (FEV 1) or peak expiratory rate flow (PERF)] during attack shown in pulmonary function test. Narrowed airways make it more difficult for thepatient to exhale, prolonging time of exhalation and decreasing force of exha-lation. Patients can check expiratory effort at home on a peak flow meter. Hyperinflated lungs shown in chest x-ray due to air trapping. Pulse oximetry shows diminished oxygen saturation. CBC\u2014elevated eosinophils. Sputum\u2014positive for eosinophils.95 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System TREATMENT The focus of treatment is to return the respiratory status to normal, deliver ade- quate oxygen, and limit the number of recurrences. Patient education should focuson understanding the disease, its management, and when emergency care may benecessary. Administer supplemental oxygen to help meet body's needs. Identify and remove allergens and known triggers to avoid causing an asthmaattack. Give patient 3 liters/day of fluid to help liquefy any secretions. manage symptoms day to day; keep airways open, not for acute symptoms: salmeterol, formoterol Administer leukotriene modulators to reduce local inflammatory response inlung to reduce exacerbations; does not have immediate effect proton pump inhibitor to decrease theamount of acid in the stomach, reducing the possibility of ulcers due to stressof disease or medication effects. Antacids: aluminum mast cell stabilizer to retain an early component of the initialresponse to allergens, which will prevent further reactions from occurring;this is not for acute symptoms. This is useful for pretreatment for allergenexposure or chronic use to improve control of symptoms. cromolyn, nedocromil Administer steroids to decrease inflammation, which will help open airways;these are not for used whenother medications not effective: aminophylline, theophylline NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Ineffective airway clearance Ineffective tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor respiration: patient's respiratory status can continue to deteriorate;look at respiratory rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, skin color, breathsounds. Place patient in high Fowler's position to ease respirations. Monitor vital signs, look for changes in BP, tachycardia, tachypnea. Explain to the patient: How to use a peak flow meter. How to use the metered dose inhaler or dry powder and in which order totake inhaled medication. Avoid exposure to allergen. How to recognize the early signs of asthma. How to perform coughing and deep-breathing exercises. Atelectasis WHAT WENT WRONG? A portion of the lung does not expand completely, decreasing the lung's capacityto exchange gases, which results in decreased oxygenation of blood. Obstruction497 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System of part of the airway will cause collapse distal to the area that is blocked. Obstruc- tion can be from a mucous plug inside the airway, or a tumor or fluid within thepleural space may be pressing on the airway from the outside. Postoperatively,patients are at risk for atelectasis due to pain, immobility, medications for pain oranesthesia, and lack of deep breathing. PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on the cause and the size of the involved area. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) due to the lack of expansion of part ofthe lung Anxiety due to decrease in oxygenation Increased respiratory rate (tachypnea) in an attempt to increase availableoxygen Heart rate above 100 beats per minute (tachycardia) as body tries toincrease available oxygen Sweating (diaphoresis) as a result of increased work of respirations Cyanosis due to decreased oxygen level Hypoxemia due to lack of gas exchange in the affected area Decreased breath sounds due to lack of air movement in the area of collapse Accessory muscle use with respiration as the body tries to get moreoxygen INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Shadows on chest x-ray indicate collapsed area of the lung. The airlessstate in this area of the lung creates a more dense appearance on the x-ray. CT scan will show an area of atelectasis.98 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Treatment is focused on re-inflation of the involved area of the lung, removing the cause of obstruction, and the delivery of adequate oxygen. The extent of the treat-ment depends on the area of the lung involved and the cause. Administer oxygen to meet body's demand. Administer mucolytics to help loosen or thin secretions: acetylcystine, inhaled guaifenesin, oral Administer bronchodilators to open airways: albuterol levalbuterol NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Risk for infection Ineffective tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTION Cough and deep-breathing exercise every 2 hours to prevent a further area ofatelectasis. Instruct the patient to use the incentive spirometer every 2 hours to encour-age deep breathing and monitor progress. Provide humidified air. Monitor breath sounds for abnormalities such as diminished sounds. Monitor mechanical ventilation if needed. If a large area of the lung is affected,respiratory support may be needed. Explain to the patient: How to perform coughing and deep-breathing exercises. Proper use of incentive spirometer.99 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Bronchiectasis WHAT WENT WRONG? Bronchi and bronchioles become abnormally and permanently dilated, caused by infection and inflammation. This results in excessive production of mucous thatobstructs the bronchi. There is some obstruction of the airways and a chronicinfection. The changes within the lung can be localized or generalized. The lungmay develop areas of atelectasis where thick mucous obstructs the smaller air-ways, making the mucous difficult to expel. This results in inflammation andinfection of the airways and leads to bronchiectasis. PROGNOSIS Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections are essential for manage-ment. Postural drainage and chest physical therapy aid in movement of mucousfrom the airways. The difficulty in breathing is caused by excess mucus similar topatients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (emphysema orchronic bronchitis). HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Difficult breathing (dyspnea) due to the mucous production and irritationwithin the airways. Productive, foul-smelling odorous cough, due to thick, difficult-to-expel,tenacious mucous, often with bacterial colonization. Cough may be worse when lying down. Recurrent bronchial infections. Hemoptysis (blood-tinged or bloody mucous). Loss of weight because patients are not eating well, due to respiratorychanges and foul-smelling mucous with cough. Increased respiratory effortrequires more calories to meet normal requirements. Crackles or rhonchi on inspiration due to mucous build-up. Anemia of chronic disease.5100 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Cyanosis. Clubbing of the fingers. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Culture and sensitivity of sputum to identify bacteria and appropriate anti- biotics. Shadows in affected area of the lungs on the chest x-ray. CT scan or high-resolution CT will show areas of bronchiectasis. Decreased lung vital capacity on pulmonary function test. TREATMENT Treatment is focused on getting enough oxygen to meet current needs of the patient,expel mucous, and treat infections. Supplemental oxygen to help meet body's needs. Postural drainage to assist with drainage of secretions. Chest PT to loosen secretions. Remove excessive secretions during a bronchoscopy. Administer bronchodilators to help keep airways open: albuterol, levalbuterol Administer antibiotics to treat infection: selected based on the results of a culture and sensitivity study NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective airway clearance Imbalanced nutrition: less than what the body requires Impaired gas exchange NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor respiratory rate, effort, breath sounds, skin color, and use of acces-sory muscles.101 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Perform chest percussion to help loosen secretions. Explain to the patient: That family member can perform chest PT. How to do postural drainage. How to administer oxygen. How to properly administer medications. Bronchitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Increased mucus production, caused by infection and airborne irritants that block airways in the lungs, results in the decreased ability to exchange gases. There aretwo forms of bronchitis: acute bronchitis, where blockage of the airways is re-versible, and chronic bronchitis, where blockage is not reversible. Patients withacute bronchitis are symptomatic typically for 7 to 10 days often due to viral (butsometimes bacterial) infection. Patients with chronic bronchitis will have symp-toms of a chronic productive cough for at least 3 consecutive months in 2 consec-utive years. There is increased mucous production, inflammatory changes, and,ultimately, fibrosis in the airway walls. The patient with chronic bronchitis has anincreased incidence of respiratory infection. PROGNOSIS Patients with acute bronchitis who have a resolution of symptoms and respiratorystatus will return to normal condition. Chronic bronchitis is classified as a chronicobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is often linked to smoking and hasa progressive pattern. Shortness of breath is initially present only with exertion,and eventually is present even at rest. Patients with chronic bronchitis often developright-sided heart failure and peripheral or dependent edema. Patients will haveacute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Cough due to mucous production and irritation of airways. Shortness of breath.6102 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Fever in acute episodes due to infection. Accessory muscles are used for breathing\u2014as respiratory effort increases, additional muscles are necessary to assist. Productive cough due to irritation of airways. Mucous is a protective reac-tion of the respiratory system. Weight gain secondary to edema in chronic bronchitis is due to right-sidedheart failure. Wheezing due to inflammation within the airways. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Shadows in affected area of the lungs on the chest x-ray during infection. Pulmonary function testing shows: Forced vital capacity (FVC) changes because more time is needed toforcibly exhale an amount of air after a maximal inhalation. FEV1is decreased because more time is needed for exhalation. Residual volume (RV) is increased due to air trapping. Decreased oxygen and increased carbon dioxide in arterial blood gas. TREATMENT Acute bronchitis is treated in the short term with symptomatic treatment andantibiotics when a bacterial infection is present. Chronic bronchitis is treated witha combination of medications to keep the airways open, reduce inflammationwithin airways, and prevent complications or exacerbations. Administer beta2-agonists smoothmuscle: ipratropium, tiotropium inhaler Administer steroids bronchodilation: aminophylline theophylline (Theo-Dur) Administer diuretics to reduce fluid retention in patients who develop right- sided heart failure: furosemide, bumetanide Administer expectorant to help liquefy secretions: guaifenesin Administer antibiotics in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis: selected by culture and sensitivity study or given empirically Administer antacid, H2 blocker, or proton pump inhibitor to decrease theamount of acid in stomach, reducing possible ulcer formation due to stressof disease or medication effects. antacids: chances of infection: influenza pneumonia Give 3 liters of fluid per day to help liquefy secretions Oxygen: 2 liters per minute via nasal canula to help meet body's needs; lowflow rates help reduce dyspnea while avoiding CO 2retention. Increase protein, calories, and vitamin C in diet to meet body's needs. Administer the incentive spirometer or flutter valve to encourage coughingand expelling of mucous. Nocturnal negative pressure ventilation used for hypercapnic (elevated CO2 levels) patients. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective airway clearance Activity intolerance Ineffective breathing pattern104 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor respirations looking at rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, skin color; listen to breath sounds. Place patient in high Fowler's position to ease respiration. Weigh the patient daily. Excess fluid due to heart failure will increase weight.Notify physician, NP, or PA of weight gain of 2 pounds in 24 hours. Have the patient perform the turning, coughing, and deep-breathing exer-cises to enhance lung expansion and expel mucous. Monitor sputum for changes in color or amount, which may signal infectionin patients with chronic bronchitis. Monitor intake and output. Increase fluids to keep mucous thinner and easier to expel. Explain to the patient: How to administer oxygen. Cor Pulmonale WHAT WENT WRONG? In Cor Pulmonale, the structure and function of the right ventricle are compromisedby chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstruction of the airflow into andout of the lungs. The heart tries to compensate, resulting in right-sided heart failure. The patient has heart failure due to a primary lung disorder, which causes pul- monary hypertension and enlargement of the right ventricle. Patients will havesymptoms of both the underlying pulmonary disorder and the right-sided heartfailure. COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. PROGNOSIS Management of both the underlying lung disease and the heart failure is necessaryto alleviate the symptoms for the patient. Medical management may provide sig-nificant relief of symptoms for the patient. Exacerbations of the underlying diseaseprocess are still likely. Progression of the disease state is possible, requiring adjust-ment in medications or further lifestyle modifications.7105 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Cyanosis Fatigue due to hypoxia and heart failure Wheezing due to underlying lung condition such as COPD or emphysema Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) on exertion and when lying down (orthopnea) due to increased oxygen needs with movement and increased respiratoryeffort of the diaphragm when lying down Productive cough due to underlying respiratory condition Edema due to right-sided failure; fluid build-up will be in dependent areas Weight gain due to fluid retention Respiration greater than 20 breaths per minute (tachypnea); rate increases tomeet body's oxygen needs Increased heart rate above 100 beats per minute (tachycardia) as the bodyattempts to compensate for hypoxia and carry more oxygen INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Enlarged pulmonary arteries and right ventricle shown on a chest x-ray. Enlarged right ventricle shown on echocardiography as a result of pulmonaryhypertension. Increased right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures in a pulmonaryartery catheterization. The right ventricle is pumping against greater-than-normal resistance within the pulmonary artery when sending blood to the lungs. Decreased oxygen and increased carbon dioxide in arterial blood gas due tounderlying lung disease. Pulse oximetry shows decreased oxygen saturation. Increased hemoglobin to compensate for hypoxia. TREATMENT Bedrest or decreased activity. Oxygen therapy at 2 liters/minute (low flow rate) to help meet body's needs.The COPD patient cannot tolerate a high flow of oxygen. Administer calcium channel blockers to vasodilate:106 Medical-Surgical Administer diuretic to remove excess fluid: furosemide, bumetanide cardiac glycoside for symptom relief of heart failure: digoxin Reduce sodium in the diet to reduce fluid retention. Reduce fluid intake to reduce fluid retention. NURSING DIAGNOSES Excessive fluid volume Impaired gas exchange Activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Limit fluid to 2 liters per day. Monitor digoxin level to avoid toxic effect. Check pulse before administering cardiac glycoside. A side effect of the drug is slowing of the heart rate. Hold medication and contact the physician asneeded. Monitor serum potassium levels; ACE inhibitors and some diuretics cancause potassium retention. Monitor respiratory status for rate, effort, use of accessory muscle, skin color,and breath sounds. Explain to the patient: How to administer oxygen therapy. Medication management.107 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Emphysema WHAT WENT WRONG? Chronic inflammation reduces the flexibility of the walls of alveoli, resulting in over-distention of the alveolar walls. This causes air to be trapped in the lungs,impeding gas exchange. Smoking is often linked to development of emphysema.A less frequent cause is an inherited alpha 1-antitrypsan deficiency. PROGNOSIS Symptoms often begin insidiously and are progressive. Shortness of breath is ini-tially associated with exertion, then presents at rest. These patients are more sus-ceptible to lung infections. Supplemental oxygen becomes necessary at first forexacerbations, then for daily use. Periodic exacerbations requiring hospitalizationare not unusual. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) due to air trapping, which retains carbondioxide and reduces alveolar gas exchange. Barrel chest develops over time as more air is trapped within the distal air-ways. The anteroposterior diameter (distance between front and back of thechest) increases, giving the chest a more barrel-like appearance. Use of accessory muscles to breathe as the respiratory effort increases. Thenumber of muscles used to inhale will increase in an effort to get enoughoxygen into the body. Loss of weight as extra calories are needed to maintain respiration. Increasedeffort of breathing also detracts from eating. Patients prefer a seated position which allows for greater chest expansion. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased residual volume shown in pulmonary function test due to airtrapping.8108 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Decreased oxygen and increased carbon dioxide in arterial blood gas as gas exchange is impaired due to air trapping; more pronounced as disease pro-gresses. Chest x-ray shows overinflation of lungs and flattening of the diaphragm. TREATMENT Treatment will vary depending on the stage of the emphysema. As the disease pro-gresses the treatment will change. Medications to control symptoms and keep air-ways open, use of supplemental oxygen, and smoking cessation are the mainstaysof treatment. Administer beta2-agonists to inhaler: These are typically usedin conjunction with other medications, not for acute effect: aminophylline theophylline Administer steroids to proton pump inhibitor to decrease theamount of acid in stomach, reducing possible ulcer formation due to stressof the disease or medication effects: loosen secretions: guaifenesin Administer diuretics to decrease fluid retention in patients that are develop- ing right-sided heart failure secondary to lung disease: furosemide, bumetanide Administer vaccines\u2014to prevent respiratory infections: influenza pneumonia Administer antibiotics: selected based on results of culture and sensitivity study or given empirically Administer alpha1-antitrypsin therapy for patients with deficiency. Administer oxygen, 2 liters per minute, to help meet body's oxygen needswhile avoiding CO 2retention. Give patient 3 liters of fluids per day to help liquefy secretions. Nocturnal negative pressure ventilation for hypercapnic (elevated CO2levels) patients. Teach patient how to use: the incentive spirometer to encourage deep breathing and enhance cough-ing and expelling of mucous. the flutter valve to increase expiration force. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Fatigue Risk for infection NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor the patient's sputum for color, amount, or changes in characteristics,which may indicate infection. Place patient in high Fowler's position, which eases respiratory effort. Administer low-flow oxygen, which increases oxygen delivered to patientwithout compromising respiratory drive.110 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor intake and output fluids. Explain to the patient: The importance of turning, coughing, and deep-breathing exercises. How to administer oxygen therapy. Avoid exposure to irritants and people with infections. Lung Cancer WHAT WENT WRONG? Lung cancer is the abnormal, uncontrolled cell growth in lung tissues, resulting in a tumor. A tumor in the lung may be primary when it develops in lung tissue. Itmay be secondary when it spreads (metastasizes) from cancer in other areas of thebody, such as the liver, brain, or kidneys. There are two major categories of lungcancer\u2014small cell and non-small cell. Repetitive exposure to inhaled irritantsincreases a person's risk for lung cancer. Cigarette smoke, occupational exposures,air pollution containing benzopyrenes, and hydrocarbons have all been shown Oat Large cell\u2014fast-growing, early metastasis PROGNOSIS Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Many patients with lung cancerare diagnosed at a later stage, leading to the long-term (5-year) survival rate of lessthan 20 percent. Earlier diagnosis is more beneficial for treatment and outcome.The longer the cancer has been in the lungs, the greater the likelihood of metasta-sis to other areas.9111 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Coughing due to irritation from mass. Presence of mucous or exudate may not be until later in disease. Coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Fatigue. Weight loss due to the caloric needs of the tumor, taking away from the needsof the body. Anorexia. Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) caused by damaged lung tissue. The patientbegins to have respiratory problems later in the disease. Chest pains as mass presses on surrounding tissue; may not be until late indisease. Sputum production. Pleural effusion. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Mass in lung shown on chest x-ray. CT scan shows mass, lymph node involvement. Bronchoscopy may show cancer cells on bronchoscopic washings; may revealtumor site. Cancer cells seen in sputum. Biopsy will show cell type: Needle biopsy through chest wall for peripheral tumors. Tissue biopsy from lung for deeper tumors. Bone scan or CT scans shows metastasis of the disease. TREATMENT Treatment is focused on resolution of the tumor. Surgical removal is appropriatefor some patients, but not always necessary. Chemotherapy and radiation are bothmethods that are used to destroy the cancerous cells. Oxygen therapy is used to aidin meeting the current needs of the body, but not all patients will require supple-mental oxygen therapy. Attention to nutrition is important to meet the demands of112 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified the body. Pain control is an integral component of care in any type of cancer treat- ment. Appropriate pain management needs to be individualized for the patient. Surgical removal of affected area of the lung (wedge resection, segmentalresection, lobectomy) or total lung (pneumonectomy). Radiation therapy to decrease tumor size. Chemotherapy often with a combination of drugs: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, cisplatin may see relapse after treatment Oxygen therapy to supplement the needs of the body. High-protein, high-calorie diet to meet the needs of the body. Administer antiemetics to combat side effects of chemotherapy: ondansetron, prochlorperazine Administer analgesics for pain control: morphine, fentanyl NURSING DIAGNOSES Anxiety Activity intolerance Impaired gas exchange NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor respiratory status, looking at rate, effort, use of accessory muscles,and skin color; auscultate breath sounds. Monitor pain and administer analgesics appropriately. Monitor vital signs for changes, elevated pulse, elevated respiration, changein BP, and elevated temperature, which may signal infection. Monitor pulse oximetery for decrease in oxygenation levels. Assist patient with turning, coughing, and deep-breathing exercises. Place patient in semi-Fowler's position to ease respiratory effort. Explain to the patient: The importance of taking rest periods.113 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Pleural Effusion WHAT WENT WRONG? Abnormal accumulation of fluid within the pleural space between the parietal and visceral pleura covering the lungs. The fluid may be serous fluid, blood (hemoth-orax), or pus (empyema). Fluid builds up when the development of the fluidexceeds the body's ability to remove the fluid. Excess fluid inhibits full expansionof the lung. A large area of fluid build-up will displace the lung tissue, compro-mising air exchange in the area. As fluid builds up and takes the place of lung tis-sue, it may push the collapsing lung past the middle (mediastinum) of the chest.This displaces the central structures, compromising the air exchange of the otherlung as well. Causes of pleural effusion are varied and include congestive heartfailure, renal failure, malignancy, lupus erythematosis, pulmonary infarction, infec-tion, or trauma. It can also occur as a postoperative complication. PROGNOSIS Prognosis varies depending on cause and amount of fluid present. Once fluid isremoved, patient is monitored to see if fluid builds up again. The fluid may needto be removed periodically, depending on the cause. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Chest pain due to presence of inflammation of the pleura in the area; notalways present. Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) due to diminished chest expansion in the area. Decreased breath sounds on auscultation over the area due to presence offluid. Dullness on percussion over the affected area due to the presence of fluid. Fever due to infection with empyema. Increased pulse and respirations; decreased BP due to blood loss with hemo-thorax. Low oxygen saturation on pulse oximeter.10114 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Chest x-ray shows pleural effusion. Chest CT scan shows pleural effusion. Chest ultrasound shows pleural effusion. Thoracentesis (removal of fluid with a needle from the pleural space) shows type of fluid. TREATMENT Fluid removal is performed either as a one-time procedure or with a chest tube,to continuously allow for drainage of the fluid until the tube is removed. Supple-mental oxygen may be needed to help meet the body's needs. Thoracentesis to remove the fluid. Chest tube to remove larger amounts of drainage over time. Oxygen as needed. Administer antibiotics for empyema: Selected according to results of culture and sensitivity study NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Risk for infection Pain NURSING INTERVENTION Administer supplemental oxygen therapy to help meet body's needs. Monitor for changes in vital signs. Have the patient perform turning, coughing, deep-breathing exercises toenhance lung expansion. Monitor chest tube drainage for color, amount, and changes in drainage. Assure patency of chest tube to make sure the tube is draining properly.115 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Explain to the patient: Disease process. Need for coughing and deep breathing. Pneumonia WHAT WENT WRONG? Infectious pneumonia may be due to a variety of microorganisms and can be community-acquired or hospital-acquired (nosocomial). A patient can inhale bacteria,viruses, parasites, or irritating agents, or a patient can aspirate liquids or foods. Heor she can also develop increased mucous production and thickening alveolar fluidas a result of impaired gas exchange. All of these can lead to inflammation of thelower airways. Organisms commonly associated with infection include Staphylococcus aureus, pneumoniae, Haemophilus Prognosis will vary depending on patient's age, preexisting lung disease, infect-ing organism and response to antibiotics. Patients at risk for pneumonia are: olderpatients; those with respiratory disease; patients with comorbid conditions suchas heart, liver, or kidney disease; and patients who develop complications (such asatelectasis or pleural effusion). Patients at greater risk for complications frompneumonia will be treated within the hospital, while those at lower risk may betreated at home. Patients with respiratory rates over 30, tachycardia, altered men-tal status, or hypotension also are considered higher-risk. Patients without other coexisting conditions, who do not appear to have the higher-risk symptoms listed above, can usually be safely treated as outpatients.Patients with comorbidities (higher-risk coexisting symptoms) or who appear illare usually treated in the hospital. Some require critical care treatments and mustbe closely monitored. There is still a significant mortality rate from pneumonia,despite the recognition of pneumonia and use of antibiotics.11116 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Shortness of breath due to inflammation within the lungs, impairing gas exchange Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) due to inflammation and mucus within thelungs Fever due to infectious process Chills due to increased temperature Cough due to mucous production and irritation of the airways Crackles due to fluid within the alveolar space and smaller airways Rhonchi due to mucus in airways; wheezing due to inflammation within thelarger airways Discolored, possibly blood-tinged, sputum due to irritation in the airways ormicroorganisms causing infection Tachycardia and tachypnea as the body attempts to meet the demand foroxygen Pain on respiration due to pleuritic inflammation, pleural effusion, or atelec-tasis development Headache, muscle aches (myalgia), joint pains, or nausea may be presentdepending on the infecting organism INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Shadows on chest x-ray, indicating infiltration, may be in a lobar or seg-mental pattern or more scattered. Culture and sensitivity of the sputum to identify the infective agent and theappropriate antibiotics. Elevated WBC (leukocytosis) showing sign of infection. Low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry. Arterial blood gas may show low oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide levels. TREATMENT Supplemental oxygen is given to help meet the body's needs. Antibiotics are given for the most likely organism (empirically) until the sputum culture117 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System results are returned. Patients may need bronchodilators to help open the airways. Administer oxygen as needed. For bacterial infections, administer antibiotics such comfort: ibuprofen Administer levalbuterol via nebulizer Increase intake to help loosen secretions and prevent dehydration. Instruct the patient on how to use the incentive spirometer to encourage deepbreathing; monitor progress. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for aspiration Impaired ventilation Ineffective airway clearance NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor respiration for rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, skin color, andbreath sounds. Record fluid intake and output for differences, signs of dehydration. Record sputum characteristics for changes in color, amount, and consistency. Properly dispose of sputum. Explain to the patient: Take adequate fluids\u20143 liters per day\u2014to prevent excess fluid loss throughthe respiratory system with exhalation. Use of incentive spirometer.118 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Pneumothorax WHAT WENT WRONG? The pleural sac surrounding the lung normally contains a small amount of fluid to prevent friction as the lungs expand and relax during the respiratory cycle. When airis allowed to enter the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall, a pnuemo-thorax develops. This air pocket takes up space that is normally occupied by lungtissue, causing an area of the lung to partially collapse. If there is a penetrating chestwound, the patient may have an open pneumothorax, also known as a suckingchest wound (for the sound it makes during breathing). A closed pneumothoraxmay be caused by blunt trauma, post-central line insertion, or post-thoracentesis.Spontaneous pneumothorax may be secondary to another disease or occur on itsown. As the air accumulates, there may be a partial or complete collapse of thelung\u2014the more air that accumulates, the greater the area of collapse. If there is alarge enough amount of air trapped between the pleural layers, the tension withinthe area increases. This increase in tension results in pushing the mediastinumtoward the unaffected lung, causing it to partially collapse and compromisingvenous return to the heart. This is a tension pneumothorax. PROGNOSIS Prognosis will vary depending on causes and size of pneumothorax. Any pneumo-thorax that enlarges or progresses to a tension pneumothorax is a greater risk forthe patient. Tension pneumothorax presents a life-threatening situation. A smallarea of pneumothorax may be monitored without intervention while a larger arearequires treatment for resolution of the problem. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Sharp chest pain, made worse by activity, moving, coughing, and breathing Shortness of breath due to inability to fully expand the lungs during inspiration Absent breath sounds over the affected area due to presence of air betweenlungs and chest wall Subcutaneous emphysema (presence of air in the tissue beneath the skin)\u2014a crackling feeling beneath the skin on palpation over the area Tachycardia (increased heart rate) and tachypnea (increased respiratory rate)as body attempts to meet needs12119 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Mediastinal shift and tracheal deviation toward the unaffected side with ten- sion pneumothorax INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Shadows on chest x-ray, indicating a collapsed lung. Increased carbon dioxide shown in arterial blood gas. Low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry. TREATMENT Once identified, a pneumothorax can be treated and completely resolved. A ten-sion pneumothorax can become a life-threatening condition. Careful monitoringand early intervention is critical for these patients. A small area may resolve with-out intervention, but the patient will still be monitored until resolution. Bedrest. Supplemental oxygen if needed. Chest tube connected to suction to re-expand lung if needed. Administer analgesic if needed: morphine NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Ineffective breathing Impaired gas exchange NURSING INTERVENTION Place patient in high Fowler's or semi-Fowler's position to ease respiratoryeffort. Monitor drainage of the chest tube for amount and characteristics of output.Note changes. Monitor vital signs for changes.120 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor respirations for rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, skin color, and breath sounds. Teach turning, coughing, and deep-breathing exercises. Explain to the patient: Disease process. Importance of coughing and deep breathing. Respiratory Acidosis WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypoventilation, asphyxia, or central nervous system disorders cause a distur-bance in the acid-base balance of the patient's blood, resulting in increased carbondioxide in the blood (hypercapnia). The increase in carbon dioxide in the bloodcombines with water; this combination releases hydrogen and bicarbonate ions.The brain stem is stimulated and increases the respiratory drive to blow off carbondioxide. Over time, the sustained elevated arterial carbon dioxide level causes thekidneys to attempt to compensate by retaining bicarbonate and sodium and excret-ing hydrogen ions. PROGNOSIS Respiratory acidosis may be due to an acute or chronic respiratory condition.Respiratory failure results in severe acidosis. The more rapid onset of acidosisdoes not allow time for the kidneys to compensate. Healthy patients usually canincrease the amount of CO 2that the lungs are getting rid of to assist in lowering the blood levels of CO2. Patients with underlying respiratory disorders will not be able to rid the body of the excess CO2in this way. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Hypoxemia Cardiac arrhythmia or tachycardia due to hypoxemia from hypoventilation BP changes depending on underlying cause Headache due to hypoxemia Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) due to hypoxemia13121 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Confusion and restlessness due to hypoxemia Irritability due to hypoxemia INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Carbon dioxide (CO2) >50 mmHg shown in arterial blood gas pH of blood <7.35 shows acidosis in arterial blood gas TREATMENT Treatment is focused on restoring appropriate ventilation, returning carbon diox- ide levels to normal, and returning pH levels to normal. Give supplemental oxygen, monitoring flow rate to avoid excess oxygen tothose who have chronic pulmonary conditions. The chronic nature of the res-piratory acidosis in these patients may have caused the internal respiratorycontrol to adjust in response to a decrease in oxygen level rather than anincrease in carbon dioxide level, which is always higher than normal. Administer bronchodilators to open constricted airways: albuterol, metaproterenol, levalbuterol Administer medications as necessary to correct underlying disorder. Administer antibiotics as ordered as a result of the sensitivity test. Mechanical ventilation if necessary to support breathing. Treat underlying cause. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective breathing Fear Impaired gas exchange NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor respiration for rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, skin color,mucous production, and breath sounds. Monitor blood chemistry\u2014potassium, CO2, chloride122 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Explain to the patient: How to administer oxygen therapy. How to perform turning, coughing, and deep-breathing exercises. Tuberculosis (TB) WHAT WENT WRONG? An infectious disease spread by airborne route. Infection is caused by inhalation of droplets that contain the tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis).An infected person can spread the small airborne particles through coughing,sneezing, or talking. Close contact with those affected increases the chances oftransmission. Once inhaled, the organism typically settles into the lung, but caninfect any organ in the body. The organism has an outer capsule. Primary TB occurs when the patient is initially infected with the mycobac- terium. After being inhaled into the lung, the organism causes a localized reac-tion. As the macrophages and sensitized T-lymphocytes attempt to isolate and killoff the mycobacterium within the lung, damage is also caused to the surroundinglung tissue. A well-defined granulomatous lesion develops that contains themycobacterium, Necrotic changes occur within thislesion. Caseous granulomas develop along lymph node channels during the sametime. These areas create a Ghon's complex which is a combination of the area ini-tially infected by the airborne bacillus called the Ghon's focus and a lymphaticlesion. The majority of people with newly acquired infections and an adequateimmune system will develop latent infection, as the body walls off the infectingorganism within these granulomas. Disease is not active in these patients at thispoint and will not be transmitted until there is some manifestation of the disease.In patients with inadequate immune response, the tuberculosis will be progres-sive, lung tissue destruction will continue, and other areas of the lung will alsobecome involved. In secondary TB, the disease is reactivated at a later stage. The patient may be reinfected from droplets, or from a prior primary lesion. Since the patient has pre-viously been infected with TB, the immune response is to rapidly wall off the infec-tion. Cavitation of these areas occurs as the organism travels along the airways. Exposure to TB occurs when a person has had recent contact with a person sus- pected or confirmed having TB. These patients do not have positive skin test, signsor symptoms of disease, or chest x-ray changes. They may or may not have disease. Latent TB infection occurs when a person has a positive tuberculin skin test but no symptoms of disease. Chest x-ray may show granuloma or calcification.14123 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System TB disease is confirmed when a person has signs and symptoms of tuberculo- sis. The chest x-ray typically has abnormalities in the apical aspects of the lung fields. In HIV patients other areas may also be affected. PROGNOSIS Some patients develop drug-resistant TB, making treatment more difficult. Thedrug-resistant TB may be resistant at the time of initial infection, or may developas a result of medications during treatment. This occurs either because the treat-ment was not adequate or not taken appropriately. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Weight loss and anorexia Night sweats Fever, possibly low-grade, due to infection Productive cough with discolored, blood-tinged sputum Shortness of breath due to lung changes Malaise and fatigue due to active illness affecting lungs INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Positive Mantoux (PPD) skin test shows exposure to tuberculosis due todevelopment of cell-mediated immunity; typically takes between 2 and 10weeks from time of exposure. Chest x-ray may show areas of granuloma or cavitation. Sputum test identifies M. tuberculosis bacteria: Acid fast-staining done to initially screen for TB\u2014bacillus will hold stain Culture confirms the diagnosis but is slow-growing. TREATMENT Patients with active TB are initially placed on respiratory isolation as inpatients toreduce the risk of spreading the organism by droplet infection or aerosolization.Medications are initiated to treat TB and prevent transmission to others. Treatmentmay be initiated for active disease or for those without active disease who have hadrecent exposure. Combination therapy is typically used to decrease the likelihood124 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified of drug-resistant organisms. Initial treatment times generally range from 6 to 12 months. Longer treatment plans may be necessary for those with HIV infection ordrug-resistant strains of TB. Some patient populations are monitored closely forcompliance with direct observation of drug treatment. Patient teaching is importantfor medication protocol compliance and monitoring for side effects. Repeat sputumcultures are typically taken to see that the treatment for active disease is effective. Administer antitubercular medications to treat and prevent transmission: streptomycin is spread by droplet. Increase protein, carbohydrates, and vitamin C diet for patients. NURSING DIAGNOSES Fatigue Ineffective airway clearance NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor respiration for rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, and skin colorchanges. Increase fluid intake to help liquefy any secretions. Record fluid intake and output. Explain to the patient: How to prevent spreading the disease. The importance of finishing all prescribed medication. Plan for rest periods during the day. Acute Respiratory Failure WHAT WENT WRONG? The lungs are unable to adequately exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide becauseof insufficient ventilation. The body is not able to maintain enough oxygen or thebody may not get rid of enough carbon dioxide. A respiratory illness can deterio-15125 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System rate into acute respiratory failure. Central nervous system depression (due to trauma or medication) or disease can also lead to acute respiratory failure. PROGNOSIS Patients with respiratory failure are not getting enough oxygen. This may be a suddenevent or a decompensation of a chronic respiratory condition such as emphysema orchronic bronchitis. Supplemental oxygen and bronchodilating medications are usedto enhance airflow to the lungs. The underlying cause needs to be identified and cor-rected to reverse the problem and return the patient to normal respiratory status. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Accessory muscles used to breathe as body works harder to move air Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) due to lack of oxygen Difficulty breathing when lying down (orthopnea) due to increased work ofbreathing in this position; diaphragm has to work harder; posterior chest walldoes not expand well Fatigue due to work of breathing and lack of oxygenation Coughing may be due to inflammation, bronchospasm, fluid, or underlyinglung condition Blood in sputum (hemoptysis) due to irritation of airways Respiration greater than 20 breaths per minute (tachypnea) in attempt to getmore air and oxygen into lungs Sweating (diaphoresis) as body works harder to move air, using more muscles Cyanosis due to hypoxemia Anxiety due to air hunger and lack of oxygenation Rales (crackles) heard in the lungs if fluid builds up in alveoli and smallerairways Wheezing (rhonchi) due to inflammation within airways Diminished breath sounds due to decreased air movement INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Arterial blood gas: decreased oxygen PaO2<60 mmHg without underlying Demystified elevated dioxide (PaCO2) percent pH <7.30 oximetry shows low oxygen saturation. Increased WBC count due to infection. TREATMENT Oxygen therapy to meet body's needs via nasal canula or mask. Administer bronchodilators Intubation to maintain patent airway and assist mechanical ventilation. Administer anesthetic to ease intubation: propofol Mechanical ventilation to support respiratory effort. Administer neuromuscular blocking agent to ease mechanical ventilation so the patient won't fight ventilator: pancuronium, vecuronium, atracurium Administer lungs: hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisone Administer anticoagulant to reduce risk of clot formation: heparin, warfarin Administer analgesic for discomfort and oxygendemand: morphine Administer histamine-2 blockers treat infection (or may be preventative): selected according to results of culture and sensitivity study127 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective breathing pattern Ineffective airway clearance Anxiety NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor respiratory status for rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, sputum production, and breath sounds. Monitor pulse oximetry to check oxygen saturation levels. Monitor sputum for changes in color and amount. Monitor vital signs for changes. Place patient in high Fowler's or semi-Fowler's position on bedrest to easerespiratory effort by allowing optimal diaphragmatic excursion. Monitor ventilator settings if appropriate. Change patient position every 2 hours to decrease chance of skin breakdown. Monitor intake and output of fluids to check for balance. Explain to the patient: The importance of doing coughing and deep-breathing exercises to fullyexpand lungs and enhance the expelling of mucous. How to identify the signs of respiratory distress. Pulmonary Embolism WHAT WENT WRONG? Blood flow is obstructed in the lungs caused by thrombus (blood clot), air, or fatemboli that become stuck in an artery, causing impaired gas exchange. Patientsmay be predisposed to clot formation, have pooling of blood, or damage to ves-sel walls, or take certain medications that increase the risk of thrombus formation.Thrombus are commonly found in vessels in lower extremities. When a throm-bus loosens and travels in the peripheral circulation, it is called an embolus. Theembolus travels through the right side of the heart and is sent to the lungs where16128 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified it lodges in one of the arteries. Depending on the size of the artery that the embo- lus lodges in, a section of lung will have no blood supply and alveolar functionwill suffer. As blood supply to an area of the lung diminishes, alveoli collapse,causing atelectasis. PROGNOSIS A small area of atelectasis will allow for resolution and return to normal functionof the rest of the lung tissue. A large embolus at or near the main pulmonary arterymay be fatal. Patients may need to take ongoing anticoagulants if they have repeatepisodes or emboli or have an underlying clotting disorder. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Sudden difficulty breathing (dyspnea) happens when the clot suddenly lodgesin the artery Heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute (tachycardia) Respiration greater than 20 breaths per minutes (tachypnea) as the body attemptsto get more oxygen Chest pain due to clot presence and area of atelectasis Coughing with blood-tinged sputum (hemoptysis) Crackles (rales) heard near area of clot INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Chest x-ray may show dilated pulmonary artery or pleural effusion. Lung scan shows ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Helical CT scan will show clot in pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary angiography will show presence of clot. Arterial blood gases may show decreased oxygen (PaO2) and carbon diox- ide (PaCO2), depending on the size of the clot. D-dimer will be positive when a thromboembolic event has occurred. Lower extremity ultrasound is often done to test for presence of thrombus.129 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System TREATMENT Treatment is aimed at meeting the body's oxygen needs, preventing the clot from enlarging or moving, and preventing other clots from forming. Supplemental oxygen therapy. Administer thrombolytics to enhance breakdown of existing clot: urokinase, alteplase Administer anticoagulants to prevent further clot formation: heparin, warfarin Administer analgesic for pain control and to myocardial oxygendemand: morphine Surgical insertion of a vena cava filter in select patients to catch clots thattravel from lower extremities up through inferior vena cava toward lung. Bed rest to prevent thrombus from breaking free from lower extremities. Surgical removal of the embolus may be necessary in some cases. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Ineffective tissue perfusion Anxiety NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor cardiovascular status for heart rate, rhythm, heart sounds, and pulsedeficit. Monitor arterial blood gas for changes and decrease in oxygenation. Monitor pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation. Place patient in high Fowler's position. Have the patient perform turning, coughing, and deep-breathing exercises toenhance air movement. Monitor respiration for rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, skin color, andlung sounds.130 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Explain to the patient: To avoid sitting and standing for too long to decrease chance of clot formation. Not to cross legs to avoid constriction of vessels in the lower extremities,decreasing the chances of clot formation. How to identify side effects from using anticoagulants, such as bleedingor bruising. That pulmonary embolism is an adverse effect from using hormonal con-traceptives and a different form of birth control needs to be used in thefuture. Influenza WHAT WENT WRONG? A viral infection affecting the respiratory tract that spreads through droplets. Thevirus can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces through direct contact. Infectioncan settle into either the upper or lower respiratory tract. The virus causes damageto the upper layers of cells. The natural defenses of the respiratory tract are com-promised and it is easier for bacteria to attach to the underlying respiratory tissues. PROGNOSIS Influenza symptoms typically run their course within about a week. Current med-ications help to decrease the length and severity of symptoms associated withinfluenza. Some patients will develop secondary infections, such as sinusitis orviral or bacterial pneumonia following influenza. Patients with pneumonia have anincreased risk of mortality from influenza. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Symptoms have an abrupt onset Nonproductive cough Chills and sweats Fatigue and malaise17131 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Fever over 101\u00b0F Headache Muscle aches (myalgia) Watery, nasal discharge Sore throat INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Nasopharyngeal viral culture. Rapid diagnostic kit. TREATMENT Symptomatic treatment to increase patient comfort and medications to shorten the duration and intensity of symptoms are the focus of patient management.Medications need to be started early in the symptoms. Administer antipyretics for comfort: acetaminophen Administer antiviral medications: zanamivir, oseltamivir amantadine, NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for injury Impaired gas exchange Hyperthermia NURSING INTERVENTION Administer fluids and electrolytes to replace what is being lost due to sweat-ing and insensible loss from elevated temperature. Monitor vital signs.132 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor respiratory status for rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, skin color, and breath sounds. Crucial Diagnostic Tests Bronchoscopy WHY IS IT DONE? Bronchoscopy is used to view the bronchial tree and to remove foreign obstruc-tions, obtain tissues for biopsy, or for suctioning fluid. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? The patient is anesthetized and a bronchoscope is inserted into the patient's mouthand down the trachea and bronchial tree. The bronchoscope contains a tiny videocamera and probes that the physician manipulates to perform the procedure. WHAT TO DO? Before the procedure: The patient must sign an informed consent for an invasive procedure. The patient is NPO for 8 hours except in an emergency, to reduce chancesof vomiting when the bronchoscope is passed down the throat. During the procedure: Monitor vital signs, respiratory effort, and skin color; cardiac monitor. After the procedure: The patient remains nothing by mouth (NPO) until the gag reflex returnsto avoid aspiration. Verify the cough and gag reflex returns. Monitor respirations for rate, effort, use of accessory muscles, and breathsounds. Monitor heart rate and respiratory status for changes. Monitor sputum for blood due to irritation within bronchi.133 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Chest X-ray WHY IS IT DONE? Used to detect the size and position of the heart and structural abnormalities of the lungs. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? An x-ray machine directs x-rays through the chest and onto film positioned behindthe patient. As x-rays are directed to the patient, some are absorbed by the body andothers pass through to the film. Areas of the body that absorb x-rays appear light onthe film. Dark areas on the film represent x-rays that passed through the body. WHAT TO DO? Before the procedure: Explain the test to the patient and that the patient will be asked to hold hisor her breath while the x-ray is taken. Before the test, remove all jewelry, zippers, hooks, and any metal on thepart of the body being x-rayed. During the procedure: Patient should hold his or her breath during the image to get a clear picture. Pulmonary Angiography WHY IS IT DONE? Provides a view of the pulmonary circulatory system so that the physician candetermine the condition of blood flow to the lungs. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Radiopaque dye is inserted into the patient's veins after a catheter has been passedthrough the heart into the pulmonary artery fluoroscopically. The image is watchedon a screen as the dye flows through the pulmonary circulatory system.134 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified WHAT TO DO? Before the procedure: Verify that the patient is not allergic to contrast dye, iodine, or shellfish. If the patient is, then either another diagnostic study will be done, or thepatient will be premedicated for this test if no other test is deemed appro-priate. Diphenhydramine and prednisone may be given prior to the test tolessen or prevent an allergic reaction while closely monitoring the patient. The patient must sign an informed consent based on institutional policy. Instruct the patient that a flushed feeling is common when the dye is in-jected intravenously. During the procedure: Monitor patient for tolerance of procedure and possible reaction to dye. After the procedure: Monitor the insertion site for bleeding. Sputum Culture and Sensitivity WHY IS IT DONE? Sputum from the patient is cultured to determine which, if any, bacteria is con-tained in the sputum and determine which antibiotic kills the bacteria. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Sputum is collected from the patient in a sterile container and sent to the lab wherethe sample is smeared in petri dishes and incubated to grow the bacteria. Samplesof the bacteria are stained and examined under a microscope to identify the bacte-ria. The samples are checked periodically, but are usually given 72 hours to com-plete the testing process. Once identified, bacteria are exposed to known antibioticsto determine which antibiotic kills the bacteria. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Use a sterile specimen container to determine that the bacteria that growin the lab have come from the patient and not from contamination.135 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System Collect sputum only and not saliva\u2014there are bacteria naturally found in the mouth, so saliva samples will grow bacteria in the lab even though itis not causing any infection. After the test: Sample needs to go to the lab. Teach the patient: How to properly obtain sputum sample. Thoracentesis WHY IS IT DONE? Removal of fluid from the pleural sac to drain fluid or identify the contents of the fluid HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? The patient either sits at the edge of the bed or lies on the unaffected side. Theaffected site is anesthetized. A needle is inserted into the plural sac and fluid isdrained using a syringe. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: The patient must sign an informed consent for an invasive procedure. Position the patient at the edge of the bed or lying on the unaffected sidewith the head of the bed elevated 30 degrees. During the test: Monitor the patient for tolerance of the procedure. Monitor respiratory status for rate, effort, skin color, use of accessorymuscles, and breath sounds. After the test: Lay the patient on the affected side for 1 hour following the procedure. Thisapplies direct pressure to the puncture site, reducing the chance of bleeding. Monitor the injection site for leakage; reinforce dressing if drainage noted. Monitor respiratory status for changes.136 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) WHY IS IT DONE? This test assesses the lungs' ability to move air. Monitor change from normal func- tion; differentiate obstructive from restrictive disease. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? The patient takes a deep breath. The spirometer is inserted into the patient's mouthand the patient breathes outward quickly at full force until all air is expelled. Adeep breath is then taken in through the mouthpiece and this process is repeatedthree times. A computer then calculates the lungs' volume and vital capacity bymeasuring the amount of air moving in and out. The force of the air flow is meas-ured. The duration of time of exhalation is measured. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: The patient should not smoke prior to the test. Smoking may have aneffect on the outcome of the test. During the test: Instruct the patient to take a deep breath and then exhale completely intothe spirometer, followed by deep inhalation. After the test: Administer bronchodilators after the initial testing is done and repeat thetest if indicated. This will show the effect of bronchodilators on pulmo-nary function. Albuterol or levalbuterol are typically used. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) WHY IS IT DONE? This determines the patient's ventilation, tissue oxygenation, and acid-base status.137 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Three to five milliliters of blood is sampled from an artery in a heparinized syringe. If the sample cannot be analyzed right away, it should be placed on ice. The normal results are: pH the test: Provide the lab with information on whether or not the patient is receiv-ing supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation as well as the amountof oxygen received or the setting of the ventilator. Oxygen supplementa-tion at the time of testing will be reported with the results. Note the patient's temperature. Alteration in temperature may alter theresults of the test. After the test: Apply mechanical pressure to puncture site for 5 minutes. Apply pressure dressing to puncture site for 30 minutes once bleeding hasstopped. Monitor the puncture site for bleeding. Ventilation-Perfusion Scan (V/Q scan) WHY IS IT DONE? Enables visualization of the flow of blood in the lungs to determine if lung tissue is adequately perfused.138 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? The patient inhales radioactive gas mixed with oxygen for the ventilation phase. Radioisotopes are intravenously injected into the patient's veins using an IV accessfor the perfusion phase. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Explain the procedure to the patient. During the test: The patient must lie still for the testing, holding his or her breath asdirected. Mantoux Intradermal Skin Test (PPD) WHY IS IT GIVEN? This determines if the patient has antibodies to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, which indicates that the patient has been exposed to the bacteria. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? An injection of tuberculin is given intradermally. The test is positive if an in-durated area appears around the injection site after 48 to 72 hours. A positive testindicates the presence of antibodies. Further testing is used to confirm that thepatient has TB. Following a positive Mantoux test, the patient will typically besent for a chest x-ray and may have a sputum culture for mycobacterium done. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Explain to the patient why the test is being done, and that a positive result means that the patient has been exposed to TB. Further testing would needto be done to know if disease is currently present.139 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System During the test: The injection needs to be given intradermally on the forearm. If it is given at the wrong depth, the reading will not be accurate and there may be irri-tation or damage to the tissue. After the test: Patients need to return in 48 to 72 hours to have the injection area evalu-ated for induration. Teach the patient: That a positive test result means they have been exposed to the disease. Further testing may need to be done depending on the outcome of this test. There may be slight redness at the injection site later on the day of injec-tion. This does not mean that the test is positive or that the patient has TB.The result is read at 48 to 72 hours. Lung Biopsy WHY IS IT DONE? Removal of a tissue sample to be examined by the histology lab for abnormalities. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? A tissue sample can be extracted by inserting a needle through the chest and intothe lung or by using a bronchoscope. A biopsy can also be performed as an openprocedure through the chest wall, opening the lung to remove tissue samples. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: The patient must sign an informed consent. This is required for an inva-sive procedure which will remove something from the body. NPO for 8 hours to decrease the chance of aspiration if done as an openprocedure. During the test: Monitor vital signs, skin color, and respiratory effort; cardiac monitor.140 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified After the test: Examine the incision site for bleeding. Monitor respiration for changes, potential for pneumothorax development after a piece of the lung has been removed. Quiz 1. Following an asthmatic attack, a mother asks you how to prevent another asthmatic attack. You should: (a) Tell her that asthmatic attacks cannot be prevented.(b) Help the mother identify triggers that cause asthmatic attacks and show her how to avoid them. (c) Ask her physician to change her medication.(d) Immediately move her family to a dry climate. 2. The patient presents with difficulty breathing and a barrel chest. He is diag- nosed with emphysema. The patient asks why increasing oxygen therapy doesn't relieve his difficulty breathing. The best response is: (a) Difficulty breathing is due to air trapped in your lungs, reducing the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. Increasing oxy- gen does not resolve the trapped air. (b) You must lie on your right side for oxygen therapy to work properly. (c) Your barrel chest has decreased, causing your lungs to over-expand.(d) You must take deeper breaths when receiving oxygen therapy. 3. The physician has scheduled a thoracentesis. The patient asks why there is so much fluid in the pleural space. The best response is: (a) An error occurred and you were administered too much IV medication.(b) Your body is unable to remove fluid, resulting in a build-up of fluid in the pleural space around your lungs. (c) This is the result of oxygen therapy.(d) This is a normal side effect of bumetanide, which is the medication ordered by your physician.141 CHAPTER 2 Respiratory System 4. Your patient is apprehensive about undergoing bronchoscopy. He cannot imagine having anything inserted into his throat. What is the best response? (a) Your physician performs this procedure hundreds of times a week.(b) I had it performed three years ago and I was fine.(c) The thought of this procedure seems to be disturbing you. You will be asleep during this procedure. I will ask your physician to visit you again and answer any questions that you have regarding theprocedure. (d) You won't feel a thing. You'll be fine. 5. A 25-year-old nonsmoker who is normally in good health reports having a bad cough for the past three weeks. He has crackles and rhonchi and shows you a small clear plastic container that has discolored, blood-tinged sputum that he produced this morning. What would his physicianwant to rule out? (a) Lung cancer.(b) The flu.(c) Pneumonia.(d) Asthma. 6. Your patient returns from the operating room. Why would you monitor the patient for atelectasis? (a) All postoperative patients are at risk for infection.(b) Postoperative patients might have received too much oxygen during surgery. (c) Immobility, anesthesia, and lack of deep breathing places the patient at risk for atelectasis. (d) Postoperative patients do not receive enough oxygen during surgery. 7. A patient reports sudden difficulty breathing with tachypnea and tachycar- dia and localized chest pain. The physician suspects a pulmonary embolism. What test would you expect the physician to The patient hospitalized with bronchitis is concerned that she might have chronic bronchitis. She asks you to explain the difference between acute and chronic bronchitis. What is the best response? (a) Acute bronchitis lasts for three consecutive months and is reversible.(b) Acute bronchitis lasts seven to ten days.(c) Chronic bronchitis lasts three consecutive months in two consecutive years, resulting in blockage of the airways and cannot be reversed. Acute bronchitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection and lastsabout ten days. Blockage of the airways is reversible in acute bronchitis. (d) I will ask your physician to explain the differences during his rounds. 9. A patient who has successfully been treated for a pulmonary embolism is about to be discharged. How can he lower the risk of experiencing anotherpulmonary embolism? (a) Avoid sitting and standing for too long and do not cross legs.(b) Take vitamin K with heparin.(c) Avoid confined spaces.(d) Jog five miles each day. 10. The physician orders a pulmonary function test. The patient asks you how the test is performed. The best response is:(a) A tube is inserted into your lungs while you are asleep to expand your lungs to their full capacity. (b) You breathe through a mouthpiece into a spirometer until all air in your lungs is expelled. Then you will take a deep breath through the mouth- piece. This is done three times and a computer calculates the capacityof your lungs. (c) You breathe into a spirometer to measure your lung capacity. (d) A computer is used to measure your volume and vital capacity.Immune SystemCHAPTER 3 Thymus vein Spleen Copyright \u00a9 2007 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click here for terms of use. 144 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Learning Objectives Key Terms lupus erythematosus (SLE) 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 How the Immune System Works Normal functioning of the immune system protects the body against the invasion of outside organisms. A variety of organisms are capable of this; however, not allare harmful. The cells of the immune system recognize organisms that invade thebody, then isolate and destroy them. At times, the immune system is not able toadequately function in this capacity. This results in infection, immunodeficiencydisorders, autoimmune disorders, allergies, and hypersensitivity reactions. Lymphocytes are the primary cells of the immune system. Lymphocytes are divided into B-cells and T-cells. B-cells provide a humoral immune response,145 CHAPTER 3 Immune System since they produce an antigen-specific antibody. T-cells provide a cellular immune response. Mature T-cells are composed of CD4 and CD8 cells. CD8 cells are re-sponsible for destroying foreign and viral inhabited cells, and suppress immuno-logical functions. CD4 cells, also known as helper T-cells, stimulate immunefunctions, such as B-cells and macrophages. A macrophage is a cell whose func-tions include ingesting foreign or invading cells. Just the Facts Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) WHAT WENT WRONG? The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes malfunction of T-cells whichprotect the body from invading microorganisms. When it enters a cell, HIV repli-cates, causing the cell to reproduce more infected cells. It also frequently causescell death. The CD4 lymphocyte is most often affected, followed by B-lymphocytesand macrophages. Immunodeficiency results. PROGNOSIS Prognosis has improved since HIV was discovered in 1981. Fewer patients areprogressing from HIV to AIDS, and both classes are living longer. New drugs andtherapies are decreasing the number of deaths. Patients are living with fewer dis-abilities and comorbidities. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Anorexia\u2014secondary to GI manifestations, oral disease, and side effects ofmedications. Fatigue\u2014cells dying at an abnormal rate; opportunistic infections due to apoorly functioning immune system.1146 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Night sweats\u2014immune system triggered response. Fever\u2014may be due to a concurrent infection related to a low WBC count. Malnutrition\u2014due to poor appetite, poor nutrition, nausea and vomiting, and most often from a secondary infection; decreased protein synthesis. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Less than 200 T-cells per microliter\u2014the CD4 lymphocyte is the most com-monly used count; <200 cells/ l signals the process from HIV to AIDS, and thus, increases the risk for malignancies and advancing infection. Positive HIV antibody titer\u201495 percent positive 6 weeks after contact. Oftenused with the Western blot to confirm diagnosis. Positive Western blot\u2014confirms positive HIV test. TREATMENT High-calorie and high-protein diet to combat wasting and weight loss. Administer antibiotics to combat opportunistic infections: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Administer antiviral medication to suppress HIV replication, causing supportof the immune system and fewer opportunistic infections. CHAPTER 3 Immune System nevirapine Administer antiemetic combat nausea: prochlorperazine Administer to combat fungal infections, which are often opportunistic: fluconazole NURSING DIAGNOSES Hopelessness Social isolation Ineffective protection NURSING INTERVENTION Maintain activity as tolerated and schedule rest periods to maintain physicalfunctioning. Avoid exposure to blood to prevent the spread of the virus. Explain to the patient: Use of condoms to prevent the spread of the virus. Anaphylaxis WHAT WENT WRONG? An allergen, usually food or medication, enters the body causing the release of his-tamines, which result in capillaries dilating and smooth muscle contracting. Thisresults in edema, respiratory distress, hypotension, and skin changes, leading to anallergic reaction. Lesser degrees of extreme allergy are urticaria (hives) and angio-edema (swelling caused by exudation).2148 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Prognosis may be guarded, depending on how severe the reaction is and how quickly treatment is rendered. Patients need to be monitored for 1 to 2 days after treatmentand cautioned about reexposure to the offending item. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Shortness of breath due to swelling of the larynx Hypotension and shock due to generalized vasodilation Sneezing\u2014a common occurrence to an allergan Anxiety secondary to difficulty in breathing Rales (crackles) heard in the lungs\u2014due to fluid in the lungs Wheezing (rhonchi) due to bronchospasm INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Tryptase levels are from mast cells which increase in anaphylaxis. After the acuteepisode is over, allergy skin testing is recommended. TREATMENT Administer emergency medications: epinephrine to open airways and to reduce bronchospasm corticosteroids to reduce symptoms antihistamines to mitigate symptoms Administer circulatory volume expanders to treat hypotension caused byvasodilation: saline plasma IV fluids Administer vasopressors to counteract vasodilation and to increase bloodpressure: norepinephrine dopamine149 CHAPTER 3 Immune System Oxygen therapy to support breathing. Insert endotracheal tube to maintain airway. NURSING DIAGNOSES Decrease cardiac output Risk for suffocation Anxiety NURSING INTERVENTION Maintain airway to facilitate breathing. Monitor for hoarseness and difficulty breathing to check for symptoms of decreased respiration. Explain to the patient: Avoid exposure to allergens to prevent future occurrences. Seek medical help immediately if exposed to allergens to prevent ana-phylaxis. Ankylosing Spondylitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a progressive form of arthritis that affects <1 per-cent of the population. Joints between the spine and pelvis become inflamed, asdo some of the ligaments, resulting in instability of the joints. Heredity factors playan important role in the development of AS. The disease is strongly associatedwith the presence of histocompatibility antigen HLA-B27 on the chromosomes ofaffected individuals. It begins in the sacroiliac joints and spreads up the spine. PROGNOSIS The course of the disease may vary in each case and from individual to individual.Some have episodes of transient back pain while others have more chronic severe3150 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified back pain that leads to varying degrees of spinal stiffness over time. The disease is characterized by acute painful exacerbations and remissions. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Severe lower back pain after a period of inactivity due to inflammation andstiffness Reduced motion of the lumbar area of the spine due to the pain of inflam-mation INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Spinal x-ray: joints show the characteristic Bamboo spine that is a late sign.Early x-rays may show arthritic erosion. Blood serum contains the HLA-B27 antigen, which is present in about 90 per-cent of those with AS. Elevated ESR. TREATMENT Nonpharmacologic measures include patient education, family education, geneticcounseling, positioning, extension exercises, and physical therapy. The primarygoals are to relieve pain, decrease inflammation, begin strengthening exercises, andmaintain good posture and function. Medications take an empiric approach. If oneNSAID is not effective for that particular patient, another is tried. Corticosteroidsshould not be utilized for long-term management due to the systemic effects. Stretching exercises\u2014to maintain flexibility. Back brace\u2014to maintain posture. Administer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent\u2014to decrease indomethacin sulfasalazine sulindac Physical therapy.151 CHAPTER 3 Immune System NURSING DIAGNOSES Activity intolerance Impaired physical mobility Chronic pain NURSING INTERVENTION Administer intermittent heat to the lumbar area of the spine for symptom relief. Massage the lumbar area of the spine for symptom relief. Provide comfort to the patient. Explain to patient: It is best to sit in a high back chair for posture. Repeated attempts to maintain erect posture. Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) WHAT WENT WRONG? Overgrowth of blood vessels that leads to malignant tumors and cancer of lym- phatic tissue and skin commonly found in patients with AIDS. Usually seen incases of advanced AIDS. PROGNOSIS Kaposi's sarcoma is often associated with AIDS. The treatment of AIDS with anti-retrovirals usually helps the symptoms of KS. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Red, brown, and purple lesions on the buccal mucosa, lips, gums, tongue,and palates because it is a malignancy affecting the skin and mucosa. Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) if the malignancy invades the pulmonary system.4152 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Biopsy to look for the HIV virus, and B-lymphocytes. CT scan to determine metastasis of the lesion to ascertain the severity of the disease. TREATMENT The treatment for KS is often specific for the individual lesion, using radiation.Treatment for AIDS will also ameliorate, to some degree, the effects of AIDS. Radiation in the affected tissue to shrink and treat tumors. Laser surgery maybe utilized to remove some lesions. Administer antiemetic medication to counter effects of chemotherapy andradiation: trimethobenzamide Administer chemotherapy medication to slow or halt the disease: doxorubicin etoposide vinblastine vincristine NURSING DIAGNOSES Disturbed body image Ineffective protection Risk for infection NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor skin for lesions to determine new lesions and/or metastasis. Daily weighing to determine changes in weight from baseline. Explain to the patient: The need for dietary changes, such as a high-protein, high-calorie diet. How to conserve energy. Hospice care.153 CHAPTER 3 Immune System Lymphoma WHAT WENT WRONG? Functionless and damaged cells of the lymphatic system undergo overgrowth, decreasing the effectiveness of the lymphatic system. There are two main types oflymphoma, characterized by painless lymph node swelling: Hodgkin's disease is malignant lymphoma characterized by presence ofReed-Sternberg cells. There are four stages of Hodgkin's disease: Stage I\u2014Reed-Sternberg cells appear in one lymph node region. Stage II\u2014Reed-Sternberg cells appear in multiple lymph node regions onthe same side of the diaphragm. Stage III\u2014Reed-Sternberg cells appear in multiple lymph node regionson both sides of the diaphragm. Stage IV\u2014Reed-Sternberg cells appear throughout the body. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are cancers of the B-lymphocytes and arecharacterized by the absence of Reed-Sternberg cells. The lymphomas are caused by a disruption of cells during differentiation. Diag-nosis is made on lymph node biopsy. PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on what stage the patient was in upon diagnosis, and on responseto treatment. Survival is generally <10 years for non-Hodgkins; may be more forHodgkins, with an optimistic staging. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS B symptoms (night sweats, fever, and weight loss) Enlarged, painless lymph nodes in cervical region, mesentery, abdomen, andpelvis. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Lymph node biopsy contains Reed-Sternberg cells, which typify Hodgkin's disease. type cells (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).5154 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Treatment depends on the staging, which is based on the number of involved lymph nodes, and the number of cavities, and bone marrow involvement. Radiation in the affected tissue to shrink the nodes. Administer Hodgkin's NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired tissue integrity Risk for infection Ineffective protection NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs to determine variations from baseline. Monitor for complications such as new palpable lymph nodes and fever. Increase fluid intake. Increase calories, protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins and minerals to counter-act weight loss. Administer prescribed antiemetic medication for nausea. Monitor laboratory results for blood counts in response to chemotherapy.155 CHAPTER 3 Immune System Explain to the patient: Consult with physician before using over-the-counter medication. Rheumatoid Arthritis WHAT WENT WRONG? Antibodies from the bloodstream move into the synovial lining of joints, causing joints to swell. The swelling affects the functionality of tendons, bones, and liga-ments that move the joint, resulting in pain with movement. Etiology is unknown,although genetics plays a part. The usual age of onset is 20 to 40 years, and itaffects about 2 percent of the population. Inflammation and nodules around jointsare common, usually involving the wrists, hands, knees, and feet. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is variable. Some patients go into remission and need only moderatetreatment. Others progress with decreased functioning, with cardiac, renal, andrespiratory disease. Life expectancy is greatly lessened for this group. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Morning stiffness in joints due to the inflammation Enlarged joints from swelling Pain when moving due to the stiffness Limited range of motion because of the inflammation and pain Fever, malaise, and weight loss INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Rheumatoid factor is positive in blood test. Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA).6156 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Positive ESR. Gamma globulins. X-rays show changes in the affected joints. TREATMENT Reduction of pain and inflammation is the goal of treatment, along with preserv- ing range of motion of the joint. Treatment is divided into nonpharmacological andpharmacological methods. Administer magnesium hydroxide aluminium hydroxide157 CHAPTER 3 Immune System Physical therapy and occupational therapy to maintain ADL and independ- ence. Cold and heat therapy for pain relief, anti-inflammatory effect, to help mus-cles and joints. Splints to maintain joints in positions that are most used. Exercises to maintain flexibility and ROM (range of motion). NURSING DIAGNOSES Chronic pain Activity intolerance Disturbed body image NURSING INTERVENTION Assist patient in placing a splint on affected joint. Weight loss to place less stress on joints. Explain to the patient: Get a full night's sleep. Avoid the cold. Reduce stress. Scleroderma WHAT WENT WRONG? Antibodies attack connective tissues in an autoimmune response. This results inscar tissue (fibrosis) forming on skin, organs, GI tract, blood vessels, and muscles,causing systemic sclerosis. It is a chronic disease of unknown etiology, usually seen in 30-to-50-year-olds.7158 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Scleroderma is a progressive disease causing early death, especially in those patients with diffuse disease. Organ damage indicates an earlier demise; those with limitedorgan involvement have longer life expectancies. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Stiffness and pain due to the fibrosis Skin thickens Edema, malaise, and fever INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Positive antinuclear antibody. Dermis appears thickened in skin biopsy. TREATMENT Treatment is based on treating the patient's symptoms to ensure comfort. No knownmedications are able to stop the disease. Various medications may be used to treatthe symptoms of the affected organs caused by scleroderma. Physical therapy to maintain joint mobility. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired physical mobility Impaired skin integrity Pain NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor for increasing blood pressure, which is the leading cause of death toscleroderma patients due to the renal effects of the disease.159 CHAPTER 3 Immune System Explain to the patient: That there is no cure for scleroderma, but it may go into remission and then relapse. Schedule rest periods during activities. Avoid the cold. Mononucleosis A viral syndrome consisting of sore throat, enlarged lymph glands, and fevers.Usually caused by the Epstein-Barr Virus, but sometimes other viruses are thecause. Occasionally, a rash may be seen. The spleen is sometimes enlar ged due to sequestration of cells during the immune response. WHAT WENT WRONG? A virus was transmitted from contact to contact. Oftentimes, a secondary bacterialinfection, streptococcus, is found. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is good. Since it is a disease of young people, recovery is generally un-complicated. HALLMARK SIGN AND SYMPTOMS General malaise Fever Myalgias Headache Sore throat8160 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Mono Spot or a positive heterophil antibody test is used to identify the Epstein-Barr Virus. CBC, chemistry. Throat culture for strep. TREATMENT Treatment is supportive with rest and over-the-counter medications for symptomresolution. Penicillin or erythromycin for the streptococcal throat. NURSING DIAGNOSES Fatigue Activity intolerance Impaired physical mobility NURSING INTERVENTIONS Encourage adequate rest. Assure fluids and nutritional intake. Monitor fever and vital signs. Throat culture, if indicated. Analgesics. Epstein-Barr Virus/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome WHAT WENT WRONG? Chronic Syndrome (CFS) is a chronic, multisymptom, multisystem syn- drome in a previously healthy adult. It results from any of five so far known9161 CHAPTER 3 Immune System viruses: Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus B, adenovirus type I, and human herpes virus 6. In an unknown way, the viruses disturb the immune systemwhich is then unable to adequately fight off the virus. PROGNOSIS The prognosis varies as the disease waxes and wanes. Remissions and exacerba-tions may be frequent. By adulthood, most of the population in the United Stateswill test positive for EB virus. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Persistent fatigue unrelieved by rest, impairment of memory and concentration,myalgias, arthralgias, headache, change in sleep, malaise, depression, and labilemood. Insomnia is a common occurrence. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Since CFS is a diagnosis of exclusion, testing is done to rule out other etiologiesfor the symptoms. These may include CBC, metabolic panel, thyroid studies, HIV ,ESR, rheumatoid factor, Lyme, EBV , and CMV titers. TREATMENT Treatment is empirical and based on symptoms. Treating and eliminating otherdiagnoses is imperative. Allowing for frequent rest periods, and adequate nutritionare necessary. Pharmacological treatment may include NSAIDs and analgesics. Asthere is a higher prevalence of past and present psychiatric diagnoses in patientswith CFS, an evaluation may be indicated. Psychotherapy may help. Physical ther-apy is often indicated and routine exercising has been found to be helpful. NURSING DIAGNOSES Activity intolerance Fatigue Chronic pain162 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTIONS Provide supportive care. Encourage fluids and adequate nutrition. Rest. Offer psychotherapy. Exercise regimen. Lyme Disease WHAT WENT WRONG? A bite from a deer tick causes the bacteria (a spirochete) Borrelia burgdorferi, to be transmitted into the human blood stream. The patient presents with fever, myal- gias and the classic bull's eye rash, erythema chronicum migrans up to three weeksfollowing the bite. PROGNOSIS Early treatment generally leads to a better outcome. Lingering constitutional symp-toms occasionally occur. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fever Generalized aches Headache Rash at site of the bite (patient may not recall bite) INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS IgM antibody is elevated. Lyme titers may be drawn.10163 CHAPTER 3 Immune System TREATMENT doxycycline, 100 mg bid (twice a day) \u00d714 to 21 days. aqueous penicillin G, 20 million units. ceftriaxone, 4 grams/day IM or IV . NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired skin integrity Impaired physical mobility NURSING INTERVENTIONS Cover all exposed skin while outside. Use appropriate insect repellant. Inspect arms and legs for ticks when coming in from outside. Inspect pets. Educate on proper way to remove tick. Septic Shock WHAT WENT WRONG? Septic shock starts with bacteremia, usually gram negative bacteria infecting the blood. The sources are usually genito-urinary system, gastrointestinal tract, andlungs. The infection may be underlying for some time before shock develops. Oncethe cascade from bacteremia to septic shock starts, it may be difficult to halt theprocess. Shock may occur more quickly in patients who are elderly, immune-compromised, or with other comorbidities. In response to a bacterial infection,TNF-alpha and other inflammatory chemicals are released into the blood, causingan increase in the blood leaking from vessels into both the infected and non-infected tissues (vascular permeability).11164 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on the general state of the patient, on the type of bacteria, how quickly a definitive diagnosis is made, and the originating source(s) of the bac-teremia. Mortality rates vary from 40 to 80 percent. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Nausea and vomiting from the source of the infection Temperature over 101\u00b0F due to infection Hypotension due to fluid displacement, vasodilation Tachycardia from fever and infection Tachypnea from fever and infection Lactic acidosis results from poor oxygenation INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS WBC 15,000 to 30,000\u2014indicates infection. Decreased platelet count\u2014blood coagulopathies are common in shock. Abnormal PT and PTT\u2014blood coagulopathies. TREATMENT Treatment results depends on the individual. Varying responses are due to the vari-able immune and inflammatory responses of each patient and their comorbidities.Treatment depends on identifying the organism, the source of the bacteremia, theappropriate antibiotic, and maintaining normal vital signs. Antibiotic specific for the type of bacteria present. Fluid resuscitation. NURSING DIAGNOSES Decreased cardiac output Deficient fluid volume Skin integrity165 CHAPTER 3 Immune System NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs, especially fever. Monitor fluid intake and output to assess for fluid overload and hydration status. Monitor coagulation factors. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) WHAT WENT WRONG? SLE is a chronic inflammatory immune disorder affecting the skin and other body organs. Antibodies to DNA and RNA cause an autoimmune inflammatory response,resulting in swelling and pain. It is most common in young women, and has astrong genetic factor. The etiology is not known. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is good but is consistent with many remissions and exacerbations. Mostpatients do quite well on a course of medications, but some progress rapidly withsevere organ involvement and subsequently, death. Certain medications may pro-duce lupus-like symptoms in patients. A review of medications is indicated beforea diagnosis is made. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Butterfly rash on face due to deposition of immunoglobulin and comple-ment in the skin. Fatigue may be due to anemia Anemia due to inflammation Fever, malaise Joint pain12166 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Positive antinuclear antibody test\u2014antibodies are present in the blood. Positive rheumatoid factor. TREATMENT Treatment of SLE is supportive. The drugs used should match the stage the patient is in at the time. Treatment of systemic signs is dependent on the organsystem involved. Administer NSAIDs to decrease the sulindac and skin rashes. Administer immunosuppressants in patients who are unresponsive cyclophosphamide Administer analgesic: NSAIDs aspirin acetaminophen tramadol NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired mobility Disturbed body image167 CHAPTER 3 Immune System Ineffective protection Chronic pain NURSING INTERVENTION Avoid sunlight. Cover butterfly rash with cosmetics. Reduce stress. Monitor for infections. Crucial Diagnostic Tests Immunologic Blood Studies WHY IS IT GIVEN? These tests are used to identify immunological factors in the blood: ANA. The antinuclear antibodies test is a screening test for the detection of antibodies to nuclear antigens. Close to 100 percent of patients with SLE will show positive evidence. ESR. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is useful in differentiating between inflammatory and neoplastic disease. Serial values are helpful to track diseaseseverity. SS-A andSS-B. SS-A antibodies can be detected in about 30 percent of SLE patients. SS-B antibodies have a high specificity for the sicca complex,caused by diminished secretion from glands. Rheumatoid factor. Rheumatoid factor is an IgM antibody that is associatedwith rheumatoid arthritis. Blood is drawn from a vein and a study is con-ducted to determine if the blood contains this immunoglobulin antibody. 50percent of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis have this antibody. Scleroderma autoantibodies. The sclerodema antibody is found in venous blood of patients who have scleroderma. The autoantibodies are positive inabout 25 to 40 percent of scleroderma patients. 168 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? A small amount of blood is removed from the patient and is examined for immunoglobulins, and their antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor,and lupus erythematosus cell preparation. A positive finding indicates that thepatient has the corresponding immunologic disease, or has had some exposure. WHAT TO DO? After the procedure: Make sure that the site of the venipuncture isn't bleeding to ensure thatadequate clotting has occurred. Results should be available in several days. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) WHY IS IT GIVEN? This determines if the patient's blood contains antibodies for the human immuno- deficiency virus (HIV) to determine if the patient is HIV-positive. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? A small sample of blood is taken and examined for the presence of the HIV anti-body. This is generally used for screening and confirmation is necessary with aWestern Blot test. WHAT TO DO? Before the procedure: Obtain written informed consent due to legal requirements. Explain the purpose of the test and how the test results are interpreted.169 CHAPTER 3 Immune System After the procedure: Explain when the test results will be available to the patient. Assess the site of the venipuncture to confirm adequate clotting. Western Blot Tests WHY IS IT GIVEN? This test looks for the presence of HIV-related viral proteins in the patient's blood to confirm if the patient is HIV-positive. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? A small amount of blood is taken and examined for the presence of HIV viralproteins. WHAT TO DO? Before the procedure: Obtain written informed consent due to legalities. Explain the purpose of the test and how the test result is interpreted. After the procedure: Explain when the test results will be available to the patient. Make sure that the site of the venipuncture isn't bleeding to ensure ade-quate clotting. Culture and Sensitivity of Sputum WHY IS IT GIVEN? Sputum from the patient is cultured to find which, if any, bacteria is contained inthe sputum and determine which antibiotic will be effective.170 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Sputum is collected from the patient either from a deep cough or from suctioning and sent to the lab where samples are smeared on petri dishes and incubated for48 to 72 hours to grow the bacteria. Samples of the bacteria are stained and exam- ined under a microscope to identify the bacteria. Once identified, known anti biotics are administered to the bacteria in the petri dish to determine which antibiotic killsthe bacteria. WHAT TO DO? Before the test: Determine which, if any, antibiotic the patient is taking. Use a sterile specimen container to avoid contamination. Collect sputum only and not saliva as the mouth contains many bacteria. During the test: Deep coughs are necessary to generate sputum. After the test: Continue taking the prescribed antibiotic. Lymphangiography WHY IS IT GIVEN? This test produces a radiographic image of the lymphatic system to determine ifthere are any abnormalities, such as edema of the legs, Hodgkin's disease, lym-phoma, lymphadenopathy, and lymphatic metastases. The results are useful in thestaging of lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease and to determine the efficacy oftreatment. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? A radiopaque dye is injected via catheter into the lymphatic system and then thepatient is x-rayed. The dye remains present for up to one year so repeat testing canbe done.171 CHAPTER 3 Immune System WHAT TO DO? Before the test: The patient must sign an informed consent due to the invasive nature of the test. Make sure that the patient is not allergic to seafood, iodine, or contrast dye. Check renal function (BUN, creatinine) as the kidneys are responsiblefor processing the dye. During the test: Check for allergic reaction to the dye such as skin rash, itching, shortnessof breath, and swelling. After the test: Administer fluids to aid in elimination of the dye. Monitor peripheral pulses to ensure adequate circulation in the feet. Examine injection site for complications such as infection, bleeding, andedema. Urine, stool, and skin might have a blue color from the dye. Quiz 1. A cell whose functions include ingesting foreign or invading cells is a (an): (a) T-cell.

The forma- tion of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets begins in the bone marrow. Stem cells are produced in the bone marrow. Initially, these cells are not differen-tiated and may become red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), orplatelets. In the next stage of development, the stem cell becomes committed to aparticular precursor cell, to become either a myeloid or lymphoid type of cell andwill differentiate into a particular cell type when in the presence of a specificgrowth factor. The spleen is found in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The spleen fil- ters whole blood. It removes old and imperfect white blood cells, lymphocytes andmacrophages, and RBCs. The spleen also breaks down hemoglobin and stores ofRBCs and platelets.177 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System The liver is found in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and is the main production site for many of the clotting factors, including prothrombin. Normal liver function is important for vitamin K production in the intestinal tract. VitaminK is necessary for clotting factors VII, IX, X, and prothrombin. Just the Facts Anemia WHAT WENT WRONG? A low hemoglobin or red blood cell (RBC) count results in decreased oxygen-carrying capability of the blood. This may be due to blood loss, damage to the redblood cells due to altered hemoglobin or destruction (hemolysis), nutritional defi-ciency (iron, vitamin B 12, folic acid), lack of RBC production, or bone marrow failure. Some patients have a family history of anemia due to genetic transmission,such as thalassemia or sickle cell. PROGNOSIS Anemia is a symptom of something else happening. The cause of the anemia needsto be determined in order to correct the anemia and its symptoms. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fatigue due to hypoxia from less oxygen being available to the tissues ofthe body Weakness due to hypoxia Pallor due to less oxygen being available to the surface tissues Tachycardia as the body attempts to compensate for less available oxygen bybeating more rapidly to increase blood supply Systolic murmur due to increased turbulence of blood flow Dyspnea or shortness of breath due to hypoxia as body attempts to get moreoxygen Angina as the myocardium is not getting enough oxygen1178 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Headache due to hypoxia Lightheadedness due to hypoxia Bone pain due to increased erythropoiesis as body attempts to correct anemia Jaundice in hemolytic anemia due to increased levels of bilirubin as red blood cells break down INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Hemoglobin level low. Hematocrit level low. RBC count low. MCV (mean corpuscular volume) shows size of cell\u2014normal (normocytic),microcytic (low), or macrocytic (high). MCH (mean color of cell\u2014normal (nor-mochromic), hypochromic (low). RDW (red cell distribution width) elevated\u2014shows the variation of the cellsizes; there is greater variation in cell size when body is attempting to com-pensate for anemia. Reticulocyte count elevated when RBC cell production is increased to com-pensate for the anemia. TREATMENT Correction of the underlying cause is necessary. Treatment may include dietarymodifications and supplementations. See specific anemias below. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Fatigue Activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Check vital signs for changes. Monitor CBC\u2014hemoglobin, RBC, MCV , MCH, RDW.179 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System Plan nursing care based on patient tolerance of activity. Monitor for angina. Aplastic Anemia (Pancytopenia) WHAT WENT WRONG? The bone marrow stops producing a sufficient amount of RBC, WBC, and platelets, thereby increasing the risk of infection and hemorrhage. The red cells remaining incirculation are normal in size and color. This may be due to chemical exposure, high-dose radiation exposure, or exposure to toxins. Cancer treatments such as radiationtherapy and chemotherapeutic agents may suppress bone marrow function, whichwill result in anemia (low RBC), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and leukopenia(low WBC). The cause may also be unknown or idiopathic. PROGNOSIS The bone marrow dysfunction may be slow-onset or sudden. The lifespan of theRBC is longer than the platelets and WBC, so the anemia may show up later thanthe effects of losing the other cells. Some exposures to toxic agents or medicationsare severe and potentially fatal in susceptible individuals. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fatigue due to hypoxemia Weakness due to tissue hypoxia Pallor due to lack of oxygen reaching superficial tissues due to anemia Infections due to low white blood cell production, causing decreased abilityto fight infection Bruising (ecchymosis), and tiny subcutaneous (SC) hemorrhages (petechiae)due to decrease in platelets, altering clotting ability Bleeding from mucous membranes (GI tract, mouth, nose, vagina)2180 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Low hemoglobin. Low Low RBC count. Thrombocytopenia\u2014low platelet count. Leukopenia\u2014low WBC. Reticulocyte count low. Positive fecal occult blood test. Decreased cell counts in bone marrow biopsy as body stops producing. TREATMENT Administer hematopoietic growth factor to correct anemia in patients with low erythropoietin levels: erythropoietin, epoetin alfa (recombinant human erythropoietin) by SCinjection or IV Administer granulocyte factor (GM-CSF) sargram-ostim by IV infusion Packed RBC transfusions when anemia is symptomatic. Platelet transfusion for severe bleeding. Bone marrow transplant replaces functioning stem cells. Administer immunosuppressive drugs, antithymocyte globulin, and cortico-steroids. Splenectomy when spleen is enlarged and destroying RBCs. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for infection Activity intolerance Risk for deficient fluid volume181 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for changes. Record intake and output of fluids. Protect patient from falls. Avoid IM injections due to altered clotting ability. Explain to the patient: No aspirin due to effect on platelet aggregation (clotting ability). Plan to take rest periods during activities due to fatigue. Only use an electric razor to decrease risk of bleeding due to decreased platelet count. Call your physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant for signs ofbleeding or bruising. Iron Deficiency Anemia WHAT WENT WRONG? A lower-than-normal amount of iron in blood serum results in decreased formationof hemoglobin and a decreased ability for the blood to carry oxygen. Iron stores aretypically depleted first, followed by serum iron levels. Iron deficiency may be dueto blood loss, dietary deficiency, or increased demand due to pregnancy or lactation.As red blood cells age, the body breaks them down and the iron is released. This ironis reused for the production of new blood cells. A small amount of iron is lost dailythrough the GI tract, necessitating dietary replacement. When RBCs are producedwithout a sufficient amount of iron, the cells are smaller and paler than usual. PROGNOSIS Iron deficiency anemia is a very common type of anemia. Typically patientsrespond to oral supplementation of iron. Occasionally a patient will have problemsabsorbing iron from the intestinal tract. These patients will need parenteral sup-plementation. Once iron stores are replaced, the anemia should correct and hemo-globin levels return to normal. Some patients may need lifelong supplementation,depending on the cause of the deficiency.3182 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Weakness due to anemia and tissue hypoxia Pallor due to decreased amount of oxygen getting to surface tissues Fatigue due to anemia and hypoxemia Koilonychia\u2014thin, concave nails raised at edges, also called spoon nails Tachycardia and tachypnea on exertion due to increased demand for oxygen INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Decrease in serum hemoglobin as fewer RBCs are made . Serum ferritin is low . Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) normal, then low\u2014microcytic anemia . Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) initially normal, then low\u2014hypo-chromic anemia. Serum iron level is low. Serum iron-binding capacity increased Transferrin saturation decreases . cells of differentshapes) . Platelet count may increase . TREATMENT Iron replacement therapy is continued to correct the deficiency and replace the loststores of iron in the body. The typical timeframe for oral therapy is to continue for3 to 6 months after the anemia has been corrected. There have been documentedincidents of anaphylactic reactions to iron dextran. Patients new to this treatmenttypically have a smaller test dose initially, prior to the initiation of treatments. Administer iron to replace what has been lost to return stores to normal levels: Oral replacement in split doses (three times a day): ferrous sulfate ferrous gluconate ferrous fumarate183 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System Parenteral iron replacement for those who cannot tolerate or do not respond to oral therapy, have gastrointestinal illness, or continued bleeding: iron dextran given deep IM or IV iron sodium gluconate given IV iron sucrose complex given IV IM injection of iron using Z-track method. Increase dietary intake of iron. NURSING DIAGNOSES Imbalanced nutrition, less than what body requires Activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output. Monitor vital signs for tachycardia or tachypnea. Monitor for reactions to parenteral iron therapy. Explain to the patient: Check for bleeding. Increase iron in diet. Teach dietary sources of iron. Pernicious Anemia WHAT WENT WRONG? The body is unable to absorb Vitamin B12, which is needed to make RBC, result- ing in a decreased RBC count. More common in people of northern Europeandescent, the anemia typically develops in adulthood. The intrinsic factor is nor-mally secreted by the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa and are necessary toallow intestinal absorption of vitamin B 12. Destruction of the gastric mucosa due to an autoimmune response results in loss of parietal cells within the stomach. Theability of vitamin B 12to bind with intrinsic factor is lost, decreasing the amount that is absorbed. Typical onset is between the ages of 40 and 60.4184 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Ongoing replacement of vitamin B12is necessary to correct the deficit and allevi- ate symptoms that may have developed. Without treatment, the neurologic effects will continue, ultimately leading to dementia. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Pallor due to anemia Weakness and fatigue due to anemia Tingling in hands and feet\u2014\"stocking-glove paresthesia\"\u2014due to bilateraldemyelination of dorsal and lateral columns of spinal cord nerves Diminished vibratory and position sense Poor balance due to effect on cerebral function Dementia appears later in the disease Atrophic glossitis\u2014beefy red tongue Nausea may lead to anorexia and weight loss Premature graying of hair INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Decreased hemoglobin due to decreased production of RBCs. Increased MCV\u2014macrocytic anemia. Positive Schilling test due to decrease in intrinsic factor. Decreased amount of hydrochloric acid in the stomach (hypochlorhydria)due to changes within the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa. Postitive Romberg test due to ataxia and neurologic changes. Diminished sensation when testing for vibration, position sense, or propio-ception of extremities. TREATMENT Lifelong replacement with vitamin B12will correct the anemia and improve the neu- rologic changes that have occurred. Initially the patient is given weekly injections of185 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System B12to combat the deficiency. The injections eventually become monthly for lifelong maintenance. Oral supplementation is not effective in these patients because they cannot adequately absorb vitamin B12due to insufficient intrinsic factor. Administer vitamin B12by IM injection. Transfusion of packed RBC if anemia is severe. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Imbalanced nutrition, less than what body requires Risk for injury NURSING INTERVENTION Prevent injuries. Explain to the patient: Use soft toothbrush due to oral changes. Avoid activities that could lead to injury due to paresthesias or changes inbalance. Inspect feet each day for injury due to paresthesia. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) WHAT WENT WRONG? Blood coagulates through the entire body within the vascular compartment. Thisdepletes platelets and the body's ability to coagulate, resulting in an increased riskof hemorrhage. It occurs as a complication of some other condition. The coagula- tion sequence is activated causing many microthrombi to develop throughout the body. The clots that form are the result of coagulation proteins and platelets, result-ing in the risk of bleeding or severe hemorrhage. It is often due to obstetric com-plications, posttrauma, sepsis, cancer, or shock.5186 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS The prognosis varies depending on the underlying disease process and the ability to reverse the coagulopathy. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Unexpected bleeding\u2014oozing from puncture sites (venipuncture, IVs, sur-gical wounds) Petechiae as clotting factors are lost Purpura as clotting factors are lost Severe hemorrhage as clotting factors are lost Uncontrolled postpartum bleeding Tissue hypoxia from microemboli Hemolytic anemia, as cells are destroyed trying to pass through partiallyblocked vessels INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS PT prolonged. PTT normal or prolonged. Platelet count low\u2014thrombocytopenia. Fibrin degradation products elevated: D-dimer may be elevated. TREATMENT Treatment needs to decrease coagulation ability (to prevent further clot develop-ment) and replace clotting components (to prevent further bleeding). Other inter-ventions may be necessary depending on the locations of clot development andany compromise of body system function due to clot formation. Transfusion: Packed RBC to replace what has been lost due to bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma\u2014replaces coagulation factor deficiency.187 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System Platelets\u2014replaces Cryoprecipitate\u2014replaces fibrinogen. Administer anticoagulant drugs to decrease coagulation; not done in all patients: heparin Bed rest. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective tissue perfusion Risk for deficient fluid volume NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor for bleeding from obvious sites (wounds, suture lines, venipuncture,etc.) and occult sites (GI, urine). Avoid cleaning clots from exposed areas\u2014may start bleeding from the siteand not have sufficient clotting factors to stop. Explain to the patient: Avoid situations that might cause bleeding\u2014use electric razor, soft tooth-brush, don't floss between teeth. Hemophilia WHAT WENT WRONG? The patient is missing a coagulation factor that is essential for normal bloodclotting and as a result the blood does not clot when the patient bleeds. It is an X-linked recessive inherited disorder, passed on so that it presents symptoms inmales, and rarely in females. Hemophilia A is the result of missing clotting factorVIII. Hemophilia B is the result of missing clotting factor IX and is also known asChristmas disease.6188 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS The most common sites of bleeding are into the joints, muscles, or from the GI tract. Mild forms of the disease will only cause bleeding after surgery or trauma,whereas severe forms of the disease will cause bleeding without any prior cause. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Tender joints due to bleeding Swelling of knees, ankles, hips, and elbows due to bleeding Blood in stool (tarry stool) due to GI blood loss Blood in the urine (hematuria) INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS PTT prolonged. PT normal. Bleeding time normal. Fibrinogen level normal . Decrease in clotting factor VIII found in blood serum in Hemophilia A . Decrease in clotting factor IX found in blood serum in Hemophilia B . TREATMENT Avoid aspirin. For hemophilia A administer factor VIII concentrates. Cryoprecipitate. DDA VP for patients with mild deficiency. For hemophilia B administer factor IX concentrates. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Impaired gas exchange189 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System NURSING INTERVENTION No IM injections. No aspirin. To stop bleeding: Elevate site. Apply direct pressure to the site. Explain to the patient: Wear a medical alert identification. Contact physician for any injury. Avoid situations where injury might occur. Leukemia WHAT WENT WRONG? Replacement of bone marrow by abnormal cells results in unregulated proliferation of immature white blood cells entering the circulatory system. These leukemic cellsmay also enter the liver, spleen, or lymph nodes, causing these areas to enlarge.Leukemia is classified according to the type of cell it is derived from, lymphocyticor myelocytic, and as either acute or chronic. Lymphocytic leukemias involve imma-ture lymphocytes originating in the bone marrow and typically infiltrate the spleen,lymph nodes, or central nervous system. Myelogenous or myelocytic leukemiainvolves the myeloid stem cells in the bone marrow and interferes with the matura-tion of all blood cell types (granulocytes, erythrocytes, thrombocytes). The exact cause of leukemia is unknown. There is a higher incidence in people who have been exposed to high levels of radiation, who have had exposure to ben-zene, or who have a history of aggressive chemotherapy for a different type of can-cer. There may be a genetic predisposition to develop acute leukemia. Patientswith Down's syndrome, Fanconi's anemia, or a family history of leukemia alsohave a higher-than-average incidence of this disease. PROGNOSIS Patients with acute leukemia typically have a more aggressive disease process,which may have a shorter course from the time of diagnosis. Patients with chronicleukemia are more likely to have a less aggressive disease process that runs over7190 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified a longer course. The chronic patients typically have an insidious onset and a bet- ter prognosis. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Acute patients: Fatigue and weakness due to anemia Fever due to increased susceptibility to infection Bleeding, petechiae, ecchymosis (bruising), epistaxis (nosebleed), gingival(gum) bleeding\u2014due to decreased platelet count Bone pain due to bone infiltration and marrow expansion Lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) enlarged as leukemic cells invade nodes Liver (hepatomegaly) and spleen (splenomegaly) enlarged as leukemic cellsinvade Headache, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss Papilledema, cranial nerve palsies, seizure if there is central nervous sys-tem involvement Chronic patients: Fatigue due to anemia Weight loss due to chronic disease process and loss of appetite Poor appetite Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) due to infiltration of lymph nodes Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) due to involvement of the spleen INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Low RBC count, low hemoglobin\u2014anemia. Low platelet count\u2014thrombocytopenia. Elevated WBC count\u2014leukocytosis. Abnormal amount of immature WBC shown in bone marrow biopsy. TREATMENT Acute myelogenous leukemia. Administer an anthracycline (idarubicin or Filgrastim for neutropenia. Administer antibiotics for infections. Bone marrow transplant. Administer immunosuppressives to avoid transplant rejection. Chronic myelogenous leukemia. Transfusion if hemolytic anemia or bleeding: Packed RBCs. Whole blood. Platelets. Bone marrow transplant and immunosuppression. High protein diet. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for infection Chronic pain Imbalanced nutrition, less than what body requires192 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor for bleeding\u2014platelet count may be decreased. Monitor for infection\u2014patients have increased susceptibility to infection. Monitor pain control. Small, frequent meals. Teach patients about infection control: Avoid others with infection. Report signs of infection, sore throat, fevers, etc. Explain to the patient: Use an electric razor. Use soft toothbrush. Watch for bleeding or bruising. Multiple Myeloma WHAT WENT WRONG? A malignancy of the plasma cells causes an excessive amount of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Masses within the bone marrow cause destructive lesions in the bone. Normal bone marrow function is reduced as the abnormal plasma cells con-tinue to grow. Immune function is diminished and the patient develops anemia.The disease typically affects older adults. PROGNOSIS Patients are susceptible to infection and often have significant pain from boneinvolvement of the disease. The survival time from diagnosis averages about 3 years. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Severe bone pain due to involvement in back or ribs Anemia due to invasion of the bone marrow8193 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System Skeletal fractures due to loss of normal bone structure (osteoporosis) Increased risk of infection due to bone marrow failure to produce white blood cells Spinal cord compression as mass enlarges Renal failure due to protein effect in renal tubules INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Presence of the Bence Jones protein in urine. Serum protein electrophoresis shows a monoclonal protein spike. CBC shows anemia. Rouleau formation on peripheral smear, a group of RBCs clump together ina stack (like a stack of coins). Abnormal plasma cells in bone marrow biopsy. X-rays of bone show lytic lesions. Elevated calcium in blood (hypercalcemia). Protein in urine (proteinuria). Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. TREATMENT Treatment regimens undergo changes based on patient response and current researchfindings. Combination therapy is common in treatment of multiple myeloma. Pain management. Combination Diet high in protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Small frequent meals. Transfusion of packed RBCs if anemia is severe. Bone marrow transplantation.194 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING DIAGNOSES Pain Impaired mobility Risk for injury NURSING INTERVENTION Protect the patient from falling. Monitor input and output due to renal function changes. Perform muscle-strengthening exercises. Explain to the patient: No lifting. Be alert for fractures. Polycythemia Vera WHAT WENT WRONG? A myeloproliferative disorder that results in an overproduction of blood cells and a thickening of blood. The hallmarks of polycythemia vera include excessiveproduction of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The excess of cellspresent in the blood causes problems with the flow of blood through vessels,especially the smaller ones. There will be an increase in peripheral vascularresistance causing increased pressure, and vascular stasis in the smaller vessels,potentially causing thrombosis or tissue hypoxia. Organ damage may resultbecause of these changes. PROGNOSIS After diagnosis of polycythemia vera, the average survival time is 10 to 15 yearswith appropriate treatment, less than 2 years without treatment. Some patients maygo on to develop acute leukemia. Complications usually arise from thrombosis ortissue hypoxia.9195 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Facial skin and mucous membranes dark and flushed (plethora) Hypertension due to increased peripheral vascular resistance and thickening of the blood Itching worse after warm shower due to histamine release from increasedbasophils within dilated vessels Headache and difficulty concentrating Vision blurred, tinnitus (ringing in ears), and hearing changes Thrombosis due to vascular stasis Spleen enlargement (splenomegaly) Tissue hypoxia and possible infarction of heart, spleen, kidneys, and braindue to thrombosis INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased RBC count. Increased hemoglobin. Increased hematocrit level. Increased WBC count. Increased basophils. Increased eosinophils. Increased platelet count. Increased uric acid level. Increased potassium. Increased vitamin B12level. Bone marrow panhyperplasia; iron stores absent. TREATMENT Treatment is aimed at maintaining bloodflow to the smaller vessels and diminish-ing the amount of excess blood cells being made by the bone marrow. Periodic scheduled phlebotomy\u2014the removal of 500 ml of blood\u2014to reducethe hematocrit level to below 45; may be done weekly.196 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Adequate myelosuppressive medication: hydroxyurea anagrelide radioactive phosphorus 32 Administer NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective tissue perfusion Disturbed sensory perception Risk for injury NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Monitor for bleeding. Monitor for signs of infections. Keep the patient mobilized to decrease chance of clot formation. Increase fluid intake. Explain to the patient: Maintain activity. Use electric razor, use soft toothbrush, and avoid flossing to decrease chances of bleeding. Avoid activities that could cause injury.197 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System Sickle Cell Anemia WHAT WENT WRONG? This is an autosomal recessive disorder in which an abnormal gene causes damage to the RBC membrane. The abnormal hemoglobin within the red blood cell is calledhemoglobin S. Dehydration or drying of the RBC makes it more vulnerable to sick-ling (forming a crescent-like shape), as do hypoxemia and acidosis. Hemolytic ane-mia results as RBCs are destroyed due to the damage to the outer membrane. Thesickled cells can also clump together, causing difficulty getting through the smallervessels. PROGNOSIS Sickle cell anemia will become a chronic multisystem disease. Causes of death inthese patients are usually related to organ failure. Patients may also inherit a singlegene for sickle cell. These patients may develop sickle cell trait, in which symp-toms would only be present in the setting of extreme circumstances (vigorousexercise at high altitude, especially with rapid ascent). HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Acute pain (especially back, chest, and long bones) from vascular occlusionof the small vessels as the sickled cells clump Fever as body responds to acute sickling episode and accompanying pro-voking event Painful, swollen joints due to vaso-occlusive process Fatigue due to chronic anemia Stroke (cerebrovascular accident) due to vaso-occlusive process Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) Enlarged heart and systolic murmur INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Low RBC count due to chronic hemolytic anemia; the RBCs have a shorterlifespan.10198 WBCs. Increased reticulocytes. Presence of Howell-Jolly bodies and target cells. Sickle cells appear in blood smear. Indirect bilirubin level elevated. Hemoglobin electrophoresis shows majority hemoglobin S (80 to 98 percent). TREATMENT During acute episodes pain control, hydration, and oxygenation are the focus of treatment. The underlying cause that sent the patient into crisis will also need to betreated concurrently. Administer analgesics to alleviate the pain associated with the vaso-occlusiveprocess: narcotic pain control necessary when pain is severe Warm compresses on joint. Blood transfusion of packed RBC when anemia indicates. Supplemental oxygen if hypoxic. Adequate hydration, using IV fluids. Treat infections. NURSING DIAGNOSES Fatigue Acute pain Impaired gas exchange NURSING INTERVENTION Increase fluid intake. Monitor IV fluids. Monitor pain control.199 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System Record fluid intake and output to monitor renal function. Administer supplemental O2to increase available oxygen. Explain to the patient: Avoid the cold. No cold compresses. Plan for rest periods during the day. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) WHAT WENT WRONG? Thrombophlebitis, or the formation of a clot within the vein, commonly occurs within the deep veins in the legs, and may also occur in the arms. Initially plateletsand white cells clump together, sticking to the inside of the vessel wall. As bloodflows over the area, other cells may deposit onto the area, making the thrombuslarger. Compression of blood flow, which will increase the venous pressure orsluggishness of the blood flow, can increase the risk of clot formation. Im-mobility, obesity, or hormonal changes such as pregnancy can all contribute toincreased risk. PROGNOSIS The clot may develop without any outward signs for some time. It may also be dueto another disease process or medication which affects clotting abilities. A smallpiece of the clot may break free to become an embolus and travel elsewhere in thebody. This embolus may lodge in a vessel in the lung (a pulmonary embolism),causing acute respiratory symptoms, possibly even death. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Some patients will be asymptomatic Unilateral leg (or arm) pain or tenderness (calf, thigh, groin, upper or lowerarm) depending on location of thrombosis Unilateral swelling of leg (or arm) due to vascular occlusion11200 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Positive Homan's sign (pain on dorsiflexion of foot) seen in minority of patients with DVT Warmth over the site INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Doppler flow studies. Venous duplex ultrasound. Impedence plethysmography looks at venous outflow; better at diagnosis inthigh than in calf. Venography uses contrast dye to visualize the thrombus; not commonly donedue to need for dye and other available tests. MRI direct thrombus imaging useful for inferior vena cava and pelvic veinlocations. PT, PTT, INR, and CBC platelet count as baseline. D-dimer to test for hypercoagulable state. TREATMENT Most patients undergo medical management and rest. Preventive measures areinstituted for future occurrences. Patients with repeat occurrences may have anumbrella filter implanted. Bedrest with elevation of extremity. Warm, moist soaks of the area. Monitor prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), interna-tional normalized weight heparin. Warfarin. Thrombolytic therapy to dissolve clot with drugs such as recombinant tissueplasminogen activator (t-PA). Umbrella filter is inserted into the inferior vena cava for patients with recur-ring DVT. Thrombectomy is the surgical removal of the thrombus.201 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System NURSING DIAGNOSIS Impaired physical mobility Risk for acute pain NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor for signs of pulmonary embolism, shortness of breath, chest pain, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), tachypnea (rapid respirations), and diaphoresis(sweating). Avoid massaging the area to lessen the possibility of dislodging the clot. Intermittent warm, moist soaks. Assess skin between changes. Follow weight-dosed heparin protocol. Monitor lab results: PT, PTT, INR, platelets. Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin, dalteparin). Warfarin orally. Monitor for signs of bleeding or bruising. Instruct patient to: Report signs of bleeding or bruising to physician, nurse practitioner, orphysician assistant. Avoid injury. Use of electric razor and soft toothbrush; avoid flossing between teeth. Diet restrictions, and to check with health care provider or pharmacistabout interactions of any medications, if on warfarin as outpatient. Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) WHAT WENT WRONG? An autoimmune disorder in which antibodies are developed to the patient's ownplatelets. Antibodies attach to the platelets and macrophages within the spleen. The12202 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified body destroys the platelets within the spleen. ITP is typically more common in women and becomes chronic in adults who are in early to mid-adulthood. PROGNOSIS Problems for the patient are most likely the result of bleeding due to inadequateplatelets. Prednisone can control the majority of cases of ITP. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Bleeding in mucous membranes or skin due to low platelet count: epistaxis oral bleeding menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Thrombocytopenia\u2014low platelet count. Mild anemia\u2014usually secondary to bleeding. PT normal. PTT normal. TREATMENT The use of prednisone in patients with ITP is to decrease the body's action on theantibody-tagged platelets. Initially, the use of prednisone will also help to enhancevascular stability. High-dose therapy needs to be tapered down. Most patients willbe on long-term maintenance doses of prednisone. Splenectomy provides com-plete or partial remission. Prednisone\u2014bleeding will stop even before platelet count begins to rise. High-dose IV cyclophosphamide rituximab Stem cell transplantation. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Risk for infection Disturbed body image Risk for ineffective individual coping NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor for signs of bleeding or bruising. Decrease chance of bleeding: Use soft toothbrushes, no flossing, only electric razors. Protect from potential infection, sick visitors, etc. Encourage patient to discuss feelings about illness. Crucial Diagnostic Tests Bone Marrow Biopsy WHY IS IT DONE? The removal of bone marrow by needle aspiration to determine blood cell formation. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Local anesthetic used at the site: posterior iliac crest, sternum, and ribs. Skin cle ansed per protocol for a sterile procedure. Specimen removed from within bone, prop- erly labeled and delivered to lab.204 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified WHAT TO DO? Before the test: The patient must sign an informed consent for an invasive procedure per policy. Position the patient lying appropriately for selected site and drape forprivacy. After the test: Place pressure on the site of the aspiration to reduce risk of bleeding. Monitor the aspiration site for bleeding. Fecal Occult Blood Test WHY IS IT GIVEN? To determine if blood is being passed in the stool, even though it can't be seen. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK? Stool sample is collected and applied to a card. A reagent is applied to the sampleto test. If blood is present in the stool sample, a color change occurs. WHAT TO DO? Before the test advise patient: No eating red meats, beets, turnips, and horseradish 48 hours before thetest; these may interfere with the test. No aspirin, vitamin C, iron, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medica-tions 48 hours before the test; these may interfere with test results. Coagulation Studies WHY IS IT DONE? This determines the effectiveness of the patient's ability to clot.205 CHAPTER 4 Hematologic System HOW DOES TEST WORK? PT\u2014prothrombin time\u2014checks for prothrombin deficiency, warfarin ther- apy INR\u2014monitors of therapy. PTT\u2014partial thromboplastin time\u2014monitors effectiveness of therapeuticrange for heparin, 25 to 38 seconds.

The central nervous system is comprised of the brain and spinal cord. The periph-eral nervous system contains the spinal nerves and peripheral nerves.Head injury Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) injuryStrokeSeizure disorder 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 11 12 13 14 15 16Learning Objectives Key Terms 5 Nervous System The basic component of the nervous system is the nerve cell or neuron. A neuron is composed of the nucleus (within the cell body), a dendrite, (which receives the sig- nal), an axon (the extension of the cell that can pass on an impulse to the next nervecell), and the axon terminals (which can transmit the signals to other cells). The mes-sages are sent from one nerve cell to another, crossing a synapse (or gap) betweencells. Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by the presynaptic neuron to enhancethe communication between nerve cells. There are specific receptor sites for the dif-ferent neurotransmitters on the postsynaptic neuron. Electrically charged ions trans-mit signals along the cell membranes of the nerve cells. A myelin coating on theouter surface of the nerve cells helps to speed the transmission along the nerve cells.This myelin coating also gives a white color to the nerve cells. Some neurons are afferent neurons. They carry sensory information from the peripheral areas of the body to the central nervous system. These neurons do nothave dendrites. Motor neurons that transmit information from the central nervoussystem to the muscles or glands are efferent neurons. The brain is protected within the skull. The outermost layer of the brain is the cerebral cortex, made up primarily of neural cell bodies, giving a gray appearance.The cerebral cortex is divided into right and left hemispheres and into frontal, pari-etal, occipital, and temporal lobes. The frontal lobe has motor and pre-motor areas,as well as Broca's area, which controls speech articulation, behavior, moral decision-making, and emotional outburst. The parietal area interprets sensory stimuli, pain,and touch. The temporal lobe is involved in auditory processing, language interpreta-tion (Wernicke's area), and memory formation, and storage. The occipital housesthe visual cortex. The and the basalganglia. The thalamus relays the sensory information from the body to the appropri-ate part of the cerebral cortex. Descending messages from the cerebral cortex arepassed through the thalamus to the body. The hypothalamus controls neuroendocrinefunction and maintains homeostasis, or constancy, within the body. The basal gangliacontrol highly skilled movements that require precision without intentional thought.The brainstem is comprised of the pons, medulla oblongata, and midbrain. The spinal column is protected within the vertebral column. Both motor and sensory fibers are found within the spinal column. Motor nerves are located alongthe anterior horns and sensory nerves are located along the posterior horns of thespinal column. The motor nerve fibers are more protected from traumatic injurythis way. If a patient sustains an external injury to the back that damages the spinalcolumn, the first area to be impacted will be the sensory nerves, hopefully main-taining motor function. If enough damage has occurred, then both sensory andmotor function will be lost. Peripheral nerve fibers leave the spinal column to travelto the rest of the body. Impulses travel from the central nervous system to musclefibers to control voluntary motion and involuntary function of organs. Impulsesare also sent from the body to the central nervous system for input.212 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Just the Facts Head Injury WHAT WENT WRONG? The patient experiences a trauma to the head. The resulting injury may be a minor scalp laceration or a major internal injury with or without a skull fracture. Theremay be internal hemorrhage or cerebral edema resulting in hypoxia and a decreasein cognitive and functional capabilities. There are a variety of injuries that may besustained. Open head injuries are typical of projectile wounds from gunshots orknifes. Closed head injuries are typical of trauma from falls, motor vehicle acci-dents, sports, or fights. Concussion involves a blow to the head where there is a bruising-type injury as the brain is thrust against the inside of skull. The point of injury where the brainmakes impact against the skull is referred to as a coup injury. There is also a con-trecoup injury as the head recoils away from the point of impact and the brain isthrust against the inside of the skull at the opposite point of the head, resulting ininjury there as well. Patients with concussion may experience a transient loss ofconsciousness associated with bradycardia, or slowing of the heartrate; low bloodpressure; slow, shallow breathing; amnesia of the injury and the events immedi-ately following the injury; headache; and temporary loss of mental focus. Cerebralcontusion is a more serious injury than concussion. Greater damage is done to thebrain; cerebral edema or hemorrhage may occur and lead to necrosis. Patients typ-ically have longer loss of consciousness with a cerebral contusion. Hemorrhages can occur at a variety of levels, between the skull and the outer coverings (dura) of the brain, within the layers covering the brain, or within thebrain tissue. The bleeding may occur acutely, at the time of injury, or hours to weekslater. An epidural hematoma happens at the time of injury from an arterial site. Theblood accumulates between the skull and the dura mater, or the outermost layercovering the brain. The site is often in the temporal area. The patient is typicallyawake and talking immediately after the blow to the head. Within a short time, thepatient becomes unstable and then unconscious. Emergency neurosurgery is neces-sary to relieve the pressure and stop the bleeding. Subdural hematoma is typicallybleeding from a venous source into the area below the dura mater and above thearachnoid mater. This may occur acutely in some patients, but can also occur asa slow, chronic bleed, especially in the elderly patient. The elderly patient with achronic bleed may have a significant amount of blood accumulate before symptomsoccur due to age-related changes in volume of brain tissue. A subarachnoid hemor-1213 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System rhage causes blood to accumulate within the area below the arachnoid mater and above the pia mater. The cerebrospinal fluid is found in this area. An intracerebralbleed is an accumulation of blood within the tissues of the brain. This may be dueto a shearing force on the brain tissue from a twisting motion between the upperpart of the brain (cerebrum) and the brain stem or tearing of small vessels withinthe brain. There will be associated edema and elevation of intracranial pressure. Simple skull fractures are displaced and do not require specific intervention. Depressed skull fractures have bone fragments that have been broken off from theskull and pressed down toward the brain tissue. These fractures need to be cor-rected surgically. A basilar skull fracture has classic signs that include periorbitalbruising (raccoon sign), blood behind the ear drum (Battle's sign), and leaking ofcerebrospinal fluid from the nose or ear (check for glucose content to distinguishfrom a runny nose). PROGNOSIS The prognosis following head injury varies greatly depending on the location ofthe injury, the severity of the damage that occurred, and the treatment that wasreceived. Patients with loss of consciousness over 2 minutes have a more severeinjury and therefore worse prognosis. Patients who have loss of memory, eitherabout the incident or the events immediately following, also have a more severeinjury and worse prognosis. Some patients develop hemorrhage as a late effect ofhead injury, occurring hours, or in some cases, days after the initial injury. Post-traumatic seizure disorder can also occur as a late effect of head injury. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Headache due to direct trauma and/or increasing intracranial pressure Disorientation or cognitive changes Changes in speech Changes in motor movements Nausea and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure Unequal pupil size\u2014important to determine if due to neurologic change orif patient has always had unequal pupil size (small percentage of populationhas unequal pupil size) Diminished or absent pupil reaction due to neurologic compromise Decreased level of consciousness or loss of consciousness Amnesia214 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Skull x-ray shows fractures. MRI shows edema and hemorrhage. CT scan shows hemorrhage, cerebral edema, displacement of midline structures. EEG indicates focal seizure activity. TREATMENT Surgical interventions may be necessary (craniotomy): Removal of hematoma Ligation of bleeding vessel Burr holes (drilling holes) for decompression Debridement of foreign material and dead cells Administer antibiotics for open head injuries to prevent infection. Ventilatory assist if needed\u2014intubation and mechanical ventilation. Administer low-dose opioids for restlessness, agitation, pain in sulfate or citrate Administer cerebral edema: mannitol Administer loop diuretics to packed RBC transfusions\u2014if blood counts warrant transfusion. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for injury Ineffective tissue perfusion Decreased intracranial adaptive capacity Risk for disturbed thought processes215 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System NURSING INTERVENTION Avoid discussing the patient's condition in the presence of the patient\u2014 remember the patient can still hear you even though he or she is not con-scious, and may recall the conversations after they regain consciousness. Monitor vital signs for stability\u2014increased blood pressure with wideningpulse pressure and slow pulse, suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Monitor neurologic status for changes\u2014typically use Glasgow Coma Scaleor similar tool to grade response to stimuli (highest score 15): Eye-opening response spontaneous 4 to sound 3 to pain 2 none 1 Motor responses obeys commands 6 localizes pain 5 withdrawal (normal) 4abnormal flexion 3extension 2 none 1 Verbal responses oriented 5 confused conversation 4inappropriate words 3incomprehensible sounds 2none 1 Monitor for signs of intracranial pressure\u2014report changes. Check for signs of infection at wound site in post-operative patients. Monitor signs for diabetes insipidus\u2014increased risk due to injury to the pitu-itary gland. Monitor intake and output. Monitor urine specific gravity, serum, and urine osmolarity. Collaborate with dietician for appropriate diet, if any swallowing or oral sen-sory concerns. Seizure precautions per institution policy. Explain to the patient and family: Any dietary restrictions. Any activity restrictions. Medication actions, side effects, interactions.216 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified What to do in case of a seizure, how to protect the patient from further injury, time the seizure, monitor for breathing, when to call the doctor orEMS. Call your physician at any signs of change in the level of consciousness\u2014drowsiness, lethargy, change in personality. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) WHAT WENT WRONG? ALS is commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease and is a progressive, degenerativedisorder that involves both the upper and lower motor neurons. There is no changein mental status or sensory function with the disease. The disease does result inparalysis of the motor system, except the eyes. As the disease is more progressed,families often can communicate with the patient through eye movements. Malesare affected more commonly than females. The disorder may present at any age,but the age at onset is usually between 40 and late 60s. There is a familial form ofthe disease that has been linked to an abnormality in chromosome 21. PROGNOSIS The disease is rapidly progressive and there is currently no known cure. As themuscles weaken and atrophy, paralysis develops. Over time, the respiratory mus-cles become involved. At first this results in poor air exchange, increasing the riskfor respiratory infections, such as pneumonia. Eventually, the respiratory compro-mise leads to death from respiratory failure. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fatigue, especially with exertion Atrophy of muscles due to weakness Dysphagia (trouble swallowing) due to muscular weakness Weakness of muscles in the limbs Muscle twitching (fasciculation) due to changes within the muscles Slurred speech due to muscle weakness2217 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Electromyogram (EMG) shows fibrillation and fasciculation; motor conduc- tion velocity normal or slightly slowed. Elevated creatinine kinase due to muscle changes. Muscle biopsy shows lower neuron degeneration. Pulmonary function testing shows decreased vital capacity. TREATMENT Maintain adequate nutrition. Consult with speech pathologist for potential swallowing difficulties. Administer spasmolytic agent specific for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which reduces the transmission of glutamine across the neural synapse. Use of thisdrug appears to slow the progression of the disease: riluzole Administer medications to control symptoms. BIPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure) to assist respiration either at night-time, intermittently as needed, or all day. Refer to hospice for end-of-life care. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired physical mobility Ineffective airway clearance NURSING INTERVENTION Develop a method of communication within the patient's capabilities\u2014ver-bal communication may not be possible; patient may not be able to use callbell system. Monitor vital signs\u2014monitor respiratory function and cardiovascular status;as muscular function decreases the respiratory muscles may be affected. Monitor input and output.218 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Assess gag reflex\u2014as muscular changes occur, normal protective gag reflex will diminish. Explain to the patient: How to suction oral pharynx to remove secretions or food particles. As mus-cle function decreases, the cough reflex will not be sufficient to remove these. How to tuck chin while drinking and eating to decrease chance ofaspiration. Bell's Palsy WHAT WENT WRONG? This is an acute idiopathic facial paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve that affectsone side of the face. Often due to inflammation, the disorder is more common indiabetic patients. One side of the face is paralyzed, making the patient unable toclose the eyelid, raise the eyebrow, or smile on the affected side of the face. Somepatients will experience pain around the ear on the affected side. The patient mayhave an associated change in taste. PROGNOSIS The more severe the symptoms at the time of presentation, the poorer the progno-sis. Some patients will have long-term persistence of symptoms, like facial disfig-urement. The majority of patients will have complete resolution of symptoms. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Unilateral facial paralysis\u2014inability to close eye, wrinkle forehead, puff outcheeks, or smile Pain near the ear and jaw Altered taste INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Electromyogram (EMG) used to indicate recovery time; can determineprognosis.3219 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System TREATMENT Administer corticosteroids to decrease inflammation (unclear if there is a definitive benefit): prednisone in divided doses for first few days, then taper down Administer artificial tears to maintain moisture within eyes. NURSING DIAGNOSES Disturbed sensory perception Disturbed body image NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor for pain control. Monitor for visual changes\u2014dryness of eye can lead to irritation of cornea. Monitor patient for reaction to medications. Provide meals in private\u2014patient may have difficulty keeping food in mouthand may not feel food or liquid that is drooling out side of mouth. Explain to patient: How to properly instill artificial tear drops. How to use eye patch. Brain Abscess WHAT WENT WRONG? Collection of pus creates a space-occupying area within the brain. Symptoms aresimilar to any other space-occupying lesion. The infection may be a primary sitewithin the brain or may have traveled from nearby sites such as the ear or sinusesthrough bone erosion. It may also enter the brain via the systemic circulation fromany infected site in the body, such as the lungs in bronchiectasis. The organismcauses a local inflammatory reaction; there is pus and liquification of the affectedtissue. Cerebral edema of the surrounding tissue occurs. The area becomes en-4220 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified capsulated within 10 to 14 days from the onset of the infection. The infections are typically streptococci, staphylococci, anaerobes, or mixed-organism infections.Immunocompromised patients may have fungal or yeast present in the abscess. Upto 20 percent of the patients may have more than one abscess. PROGNOSIS Identification of the organism and appropriate treatment is imperative to resolutionof the infection. There is a significant mortality rate in these patients. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Drowsiness due to increased intracranial pressure Headache due to increased intracranial pressure Confusion or inattention Seizures due to irritation of brain tissue Increasing intracranial pressure Widened pulse pressure and bradycardia due to increased intracranial pressure Focal neurologic deficit, depending on location of abscess Nystagmus with cerebral abscess Aphasia with frontal of coordination (ataxia) with a cerebellar abscess INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CBC elevated white blood cell count due to bacterial presence. CT scan shows area of abscess site differentiated from surrounding tissue . MRI shows area of abscess site possibly earlier than CT scan . Biopsy to positively identify organism . TREATMENT Surgically drain (aspiration or open) the abscess to relieve intracranialpressure.221 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Administer antibiotic intravenously, depending on organism: nafcillin sodium (penicillinase-resistant penicillin) penicillin G benzathine chloramphenicol metronidazole Administer corticosteroids in divided doses to decrease inflammation: dexamethasone\u2014taper dose down before stopping Administer anticonvulsants to reduce seizure risk; watch for drug interactions: phenytoin phenobarbital Administer osmotic diuretics to decrease cerebral edema: mannitol NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for disturbed thought process Risk for falls NURSING INTERVENTION Assess the patient's ability to think, reason, and remember. Assess the patient's speech capabilities. Assess the patient's movement and senses. Assess the patient's cranial nerve function. Monitor vital signs. Monitor fluid intake and output. Monitor for signs of infection in post-operative patients. Monitor for side effects of medications. Explain to the patient: Need for continued antibiotic treatments. How to administer IV antibiotics at home, how to monitor IV access, and when to call for problems. Need for follow up CT scan or MRI imaging for monitoring.222 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Brain Tumor WHAT WENT WRONG? A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells within the brain tissue. The tumor may be a primary site that originated in the brain or a secondary site that has metastasizedfrom a cancer site elsewhere in the body. Because the tumor is growing within theconfined space of the skull, the patient will eventually develop signs of increasedintracranial pressure. Some cell types grow faster than others; the patients with themore aggressive, fast-growing cancers will develop symptoms more quickly. PROGNOSIS Meningiomas are typically benign tumors that begin from the meninges (coveringthe brain). They are more common in women and in people as they age. Treatmentis surgical removal, but the growth tends to recur. Gliomas are malignant brain tumors of the neuroglial cells that tend to be fast- growing. Patients have nonspecific symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.Treatment typically includes surgical debulking of the tumor; complete removal isoften not possible at the time of diagnosis. Surgery is followed by radiation andchemotherapy. Astrocytoma is the most common glioma and has a variable progno-sis. Oligodendroglioma is more slow-growing and may be calcified. Glioblastoma isa poorly differentiated glioma with a poor prognosis. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Cerebellum or brain stem: Lack of coordination\u2014cerebellum helps coordinate gross movements Hypotonia of limbs Ataxia Frontal lobe: Inability to speak (expressive aphasia) Slowing of mental activity Personality changes Anosmia (loss of sense of smell)5223 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Occipital lobe: Impaired vision\u2014defect in visual fields; patient may deny or be unaware of defect Prosopagnosia (patient is unable to recognize familiar faces) Change in color perception Parietal lobe: Seizures Sight disturbances result in visual field defect Sensory loss\u2014unable to identify object placed in hand without looking Temporal lobe: Seizures Taste or smell hallucinations Auditory hallucinations Depersonalization Emotional changes Visual field defects Receptive aphasia Altered perception of music INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS MRI with gadolinium (contrast) defines tumor location, size. CT scan shows characteristic appearance of meningioma . Angiography will show blood flow to the area; some tumors will displacevessels as they grow . TREATMENT Chemotherapeutic agents alone or in combination with radiation and surgery.May be given orally, intravenously or through an Ommaya reservoir. the area to decrease tumor size. Craniotomy to remove the tumor if appropriate; this depends on location, size, primary site of cancer, and number of tumors. Some patients may haveseveral small, scattered tumors, making surgery impractical. Administer glucocorticoid to reduce swelling or inflammatory responsewithin confined space inside skull (no room to expand, bone does not give): dexamethasone Administer osmotic diuretic to reduce cerebral edema: mannitol risk of gastric irritation: sucralfate Administer H2 receptor antagonists to reduce risk of gastric irritation: ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, cimetidine Administer proton irritation: lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole NURSING DIAGNOSES Disturbed sensory perception Risk for injury NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor neurologic function. Check for side effects to medications. Seizure precautions per institution protocol. Assess for pain control. Explain to the patient: Home care needs. Possible need for hospice.225 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Cerebral Aneurysm WHAT WENT WRONG? A cerebral aneurysm is a balloon-like out-pouching caused by a congenital or developed weakness in a cerebral artery. Trauma, infection, or vessel wall lesionsdue to atherosclerosis can all lead to the development of an aneurysm. Increasedpressure within the vessel lumen may cause the aneurysm to rupture, causing sig-nificant intracranial bleeding. PROGNOSIS Patients are often asymptomatic with the aneurysm, until the time of the rupture.Some patients have the aneurysm identified on a radiological study as an inciden-tal finding. The decision can then be made to monitor or treat the aneurysm. If anarterial aneurysm ruptures without warning, the patient will have significant bleed-ing\u2014a hemorrhagic stroke. The blood may need to be evacuated from the intracra-nial area to relieve pressure. The rupture of the aneurysm may be fatal, or the patientmay have long-term disability following the event. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic until rupture Very bad headache due to hemorrhage and increased intracranial pressure Decreased level of consciousness due to increased intracranial pressure fromblood accumulating within the brain INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Angiogram highlights the aneurysm due to structural abnormality. CT scan shows the aneurysm unless it is very small. Digital subtraction angiography shows the detail of the vasculature\u2014abnor-mal structure.6226 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Diffusion/perfusion MRI or MRA (magnetic shows vessel structure. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) shows the perfu-sion of blood flow to a specific area of the brain. TREATMENT Surgical repair of the aneurysm. Monitor level of consciousness and neurologic status. Administer corticosteroid drugs to reduce inflammation: dexamethasone Administer anticonvulsant drugs to reduce seizure risk due to irritation ofbrain: phenytoin, phenobarbital Administer stool-softener drugs to decrease need to strain (straining increasesintracranial pressure): docusate sodium Bed rest until otherwise ordered by physician, nurse practitioner, or physi-cian assistant. Elevate head of bed 30 degrees. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective tissue perfusion Decreased intracranial adaptive capacity NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor the patient's neurological function for changes\u2014typically useGlasgow Coma Scale or similar tool to grade response to stimuli (highestscore 15).

Explain to the patient: Needs for homecare. When to call healthcare provider. Encephalitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Encephalitis is the inflammation of the brain tissue, most often caused by a virus,although it can also be due to bacteria, fungus, or protozoa. In the case of viralencephalitis, the patient typically will have had viral symptoms prior to the currentillness. The virus enters the central nervous system via the bloodstream and beginsto reproduce. Inflammation in the area follows, causing damage to the neurons.Demyelination of the nerve fibers in the affected area and hemorrhage, edema, andnecrosis occur, which create small cavities simplexvirus encephalitis. forms of encephalitis can be transmitted by insects (suchas mosquitoes or ticks) to humans, such as West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis,or equine encephalitis. PROGNOSIS Identification of the organism is important in order to individualize the treatmentfor the patient. The earlier that symptoms are recognized and the earlier the patient7228 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified enters the healthcare system the better. Some patients will incur permanent dis- ability from the irreversible damage that occurs to the brain. These patients maybe in need of long-term custodial care. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fever due to infection Nausea and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure Stiff neck due to meningeal irritation Drowsiness, lethargy, or stupor due to increased intracranial pressure Altered mental status\u2014irritability, confusion, disorientation, personality change Headache due to increased intracranial pressure Seizure activity possible due to irritation of brain tissue INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Blood cultures used to help identify organism when patient is febrile. TREATMENT Monitor respiratory status for compromise. Monitor vital signs for widened pulse pressure and bradycardia\u2014signs ofincreased intracranial pressure. Monitor neurologic function for change. Administer decrease inflammation: dexamethasone Administer antipyretics to reduce fever: chance of seizure activity: phenobarbital Administer diuretics to decrease cerebral edema, if indicated:229 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System furosemide mannitol NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired physical mobility Disturbed thought processes NURSING INTERVENTION Range of motion exercises\u2014active or passive.

Monitor fluid input and output. Explain to the patient and family: Home care needs. Necessity of turning and positioning. Medication actions, side effects, and interactions.230 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome WHAT WENT WRONG? This is an acute, progressive autoimmune condition that affects the peripheral nerves. Symptoms occur as the myelin surrounding the axon on the peripheral nervesis damaged from the autoimmune effect. The disease typically follows a viral in-fection, surgery, other acute illness or immunization by a couple of weeks. AscendingGuillain-Barr\u00e9 exhibits muscle weakness and/or paralysis that begins in the distallower extremities and travels upwards. The patient may also experience alteredsensory perception in the same areas, such as the sensation of crawling, tingling,burning, or pain. The progression of symptoms may take hours or days. DescendingGuillain-Barr\u00e9 begins with muscles in the face, jaw, or throat and travels down-ward. Respiratory compromise is a concern as the paralysis reaches the level of theintercostal muscles and diaphragm. Breathing can become compromised morequickly in patients with descending disease. Level of consciousness, mental status,personality, and pupil size are not affected. PROGNOSIS Patient support and monitoring are important during symptom progression.Involvement of respiratory muscles may result in respiratory compromise or fail-ure. Involvement of ocular areas may cause blindness. If the nerve cell body isdamaged during the acute phase, there may be permanent deficits for the patientin the involved area. Otherwise, the axons of the nerves may be able to repair thedamage over several months. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Burning or tickling feeling due to demyelination of the nerve axons Symmetrical weakness or flaccid paralysis, typically ascending in pattern Absence of deep tendon reflexes due to changes within the nerves\u2014reflexesare a sensory-motor response that happens at the spinal level, not the brain Recent infection or other acute illness Facial weakness, dysphagia, visual changes in descending disease8231 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Labile blood pressure and cardiac dysrhythmias due to autonomic nervous system response INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Lumbar puncture will show cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with increased pro-tein; may not be present initially . Nerve conduction studies show slowed velocity . Pulmonary function tests show diminished tidal volume and vital capacity . TREATMENT Monitor respirations and support ventilation if necessary. Plasmapheresis for plasma exchange to remove the antibodies in the circu-lation. Administer immunoglobulin intravenously after drawing labs for serum IgA. NG tube feeding if swallowing is a problem. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective breathing pattern Impaired gas exchange Impaired physical mobility Powerlessness NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor for progression of change of sensation. Monitor respiratory status for change in effort or rate, use of accessory muscles, cyanosis, change in breath sounds, breathlessness when talking,irritability, and decreased cognitive awareness. Call physician if there are respiratory changes or decrease in pulse oximeterreading.232 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor gag reflex. Monitor for visual changes. Monitor for communication ability; the patient may need special method to communicate with staff if not able to use call bell system. Turn and reposition. Consult with social worker or chaplain for support services available topatient. Explain to the patient: Importance of turning and positioning. Care of the plasmapheresis access site. Importance of planning for home care needs. Huntington's Disease (Chorea) WHAT WENT WRONG? This is a degenerative disease that presents with a gradual onset of involuntary,jerking movements (chorea) and a progressive decline in mental ability, resultingin behavioral changes and dementia. The disease is transmitted genetically, as anautosomal dominant trait located on chromosome 4. Family members of patientscan have genetic testing done to identify presence of the gene. The symptoms typ-ically appear between the ages of 30 and 50 years. PROGNOSIS The patient may present with either abnormalities of movements or changes inintellectual function. In time, both will be present. The mental status changes willprogress to dementia. The disease will prove to be fatal within 10 to 20 years fromthe time of onset. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Personality changes Irritability or moodiness Psychiatric disturbance9233 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Progressive dementia as disease causes further neurologic degeneration Restlessness or fidgeting due to dyskinesia Abnormal, jerking movements (chorea) Depression INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Genetic testing can detect gene presence even prior to onset of symptoms. CT scan shows cerebral atrophy later in disease. MRI shows atrophy later in disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) shows decrease in glucose uptake in specific areas in a structurally normal brain. TREATMENT Huntington's disease is progressive and while there is no cure for it, medicationscan be used to control symptoms. Genetic counseling. Control dyskinesia and behavior with medication to block dopamine receptors: phenothiazines haloperidol reserpine. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for injury Impaired physical mobility Ineffective health maintenance NURSING INTERVENTION Provide basic needs for the patient, assist with ADLs as needed. Protect the patient from suicide attempts due to depression.234 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Assist the patient with positioning for safety and comfort. Explain to the patient: Nature of disease. Genetic counseling available for family members of patients. Meningitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Meningitis is the inflammation of the meningeal coverings of the brain and spinal cord, most commonly due to bacteria or viral cause, although it can also be causedby fungus, protozoa, or toxic exposure. Bacterial meningitis is the most commonand H. influenzae meningitis infections has decreased since the vaccine against H. influenzae began to be used routinely in infants in the early 1990s. Other organisms that can causebacterial meningitis include Staphylococcus aureus ,Escherichia coli, and Pseudo- monas. Organisms typically travel either through the bloodstream to the centralnervous system or enter by direct contamination (skull fracture or extension fromsinus infections). Bacterial meningitis is more common in colder months whenupper respiratory tract infections are more common. People in close living con-ditions, such as prisons, military barracks, or college dorms are at greater risk foroutbreaks of bacterial meningitis due to likelihood of transmission. Viral meningitis may follow other viral infections, such as mumps, plex or often a self-limitingillness. Patients who are immunocompromised have an increased risk for contracting a fungal meningitis. This may travel from the bloodstream to the central nervoussystem or by direct contamination. Cryptococcus neoformans may be the causative organism in these patients. PROGNOSIS Identification of meningitis and the causative organism is important in order toadequately treat the patient. Bacterial meningitis still has a significant mortality rateand these patients need to be managed in the hospital. Some patients will have per-manent neurologic effects following the acute episode. Viral meningitis is typically10235 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System self-limiting. Fungal meningitis often occurs in patients who are immunocompro- mised. Patients who have comorbidities or are elderly have greater difficulty withthe symptoms of meningitis. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Stiff neck due to meningeal irritation and irritation of the spinal nerves Nuchal rigidity (pain when flexing chin toward chest) due to meningeal irri-tation and irritation of the spinal nerves Headache due to increased intracranial pressure Nausea and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure Photophobia (sensitivity to light) due to irritation of the cranial nerves Fever due to infection Malaise and fatigue due to infection Myalgia (muscle aches) due to viral infection Petechial rash on skin and mucous membranes with meningococcal infection Seizures due to irritation of brain from increased intracranial pressure INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Lumbar puncture for cerebral spinal fluid analysis, glucose (bacterial low),protein (bacterial elevated), cell counts (bacterial elevated neutrophils), andculture. Increased cerebral spinal fluid pressure noted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of cerebrospinal fluid to test for organ-isms\u2014results within a couple of hours. Culture and sensitivity\u2014results may take up to 72 hours. Blood cultures. CT scan brain to rule out space-occupying lesion as cause of symptoms. TREATMENT Administer antibiotics as soon as possible to improve outcome for bacterialmeningitis: penicillin G236 Medical-Surgical corticosteroid osmotic diuretic for necessary: phenytoin, phenobarbital Bed rest until neurologic irritation improves. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for injury Powerlessness NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output to check fluid balance. Keep room darkened due to photophobia. Monitor neurologic function at least every 2 to 4 hours, changes in mentalstatus, level of consciousness, pupil reactions, speech, facial movement sym-metry, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Seizure precautions per institution policy. Isolation per policy depending on organism.237 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Explain to the patient: Why restrictions (bed rest) are necessary. Vaccine available for meningococcal meningitis\u2014the 2 different types are meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) conjugate vac-cine (MCV4). Multiple Sclerosis (MS) WHAT WENT WRONG? This is an autoimmune disease that results in demyelination of the white matter ofthe nervous system. Nerve impulses travel along the myelin coating on the outsideof the nerve cells. With the disruption in the myelin on the outside of the nervecells, the transmission of information from cell to cell within the nervous system isaltered. The patient's sensations, movements, or mental function may be affected.A patient with relapsing-remitting disease will have episodes of exacerbation whensymptoms occur and then months or years of symptom-free episodes. A portion ofthese patients will progress to enter a disease state that has a steady pattern of dete-rioration without relation to the periodic exacerbations; this is referred to as a sec-ondary progressive disease. Other patients have a primary progressive disease anddevelop the steady deterioration from the onset of the disease. PROGNOSIS The actual cause of the disease is unknown, although it is thought to be autoim-mune. The disease is progressive. Stress may be noted to aggravate symptoms.When damage is done to the nerve cells, it is not repairable, even when symptomsresolve in between periods of exacerbation. The pattern of symptoms will varyfrom one patient to the next. The time frame between exacerbations will also vary.As the disease progresses, the patient will lose more functional ability and willultimately need assistance with basic self-care needs. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Symptoms have periods of exacerbation and remission. Symptoms typicallyresolve completely in between exacerbations early in the disease process.11238 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Double vision (diplopia) Blurred vision Fatigue Muscle weakness or unsteadiness Unsteady gait due to muscle weakness and general unsteadiness Intolerance of temperature changes Ataxia (decrease in motor coordination, gross motor movements) Increased deep tendon reflexes Slurred speech Burning tingling on the skin (paresthesia) Paralysis later in disease state Memory loss; loss of attention or mental focus Urinary urgency or hesitancy due to changes in sphincter control INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) in cerebral spinal fluid. MRI shows demyelination and CNS plaques. CT scan shows increased density of white matter or plaque formation. TREATMENT Use one of the following Biologic Response Modifiers on a continuous basis, not just during periods of exacerbation: interferon beta-1a interferon beta-1b glatiramer acetate methylprednisolone intravenously prednisone 60 to 80 mg daily the first week, then tapered over the next couple of weeks dexamethasone Administer one of the following for muscle relaxation: dantrolene baclofen carisoprodol metaxalone tizanidine diazepam Use of may help with fatigue symptoms: modafinil (tricyclic) may help with discomfort associated with pares-thesia Administer medications to help with altered bladder function: oxybutynin hyoscyamine sulfate darifenacin solifenacin plasma (plasmapheresis).240 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired physical mobility Fatigue Self-care deficit NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor motor movements for interference with ADLs. Encourage activity balanced with rest periods. Assess cognitive function for changes, or deterioration. Explain to the patient: Bladder training. Teach self-catheterization if necessary (for patients with flexic bladder). Increase fluid intake unless other medical problems contraindicate. Importance of positioning. Avoid temperature extremes. Medication compliance. Myasthenia Gravis WHAT WENT WRONG? This is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system involving antibodies that have been produced by the body; they bind to receptor sites that normally bind acetyl-choline. This prevents the acetylcholine from binding to the receptor sites on theskeletal muscle, inhibiting normal muscle contraction in the affected area. Theareas of the body most commonly affected by the autoimmune disease include themuscles in the eyes, face, lips, tongue, throat, and neck, resulting in weakness andfatigue of these areas. The disease does not seem to be hereditary, but does havea family tendency toward autoimmune disorders. The majority of the patientshave a hyperplasia (excessive growth of normal cells) of the thymus gland.Myasthenia gravis is more likely to develop in young adults and is more commonin women.12241 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System PROGNOSIS The disease can take a variety of forms from mild weakness and drooping of the eye muscles to generalized, progressive weakness that ultimately affects respira-tory function. Progression of symptoms will vary from patient to patient. There aretypically episodes of exacerbations and remissions. The more aggressive form ofthe disease progresses more rapidly, resulting in death from respiratory failure. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) due to muscular weakness Diplopia (double vision) due to inability to keep both eyes focused on thesame object Trouble closing eyes completely; dry eyes due to muscle weakness Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) due to muscle weakness Muscle weakness later in the day due to fatigue Proximal muscle weakness Fatigue In advanced disease\u2014loss of bowel and bladder control; difficulty with res-piratory function Myasthenic crisis is an exacerbation of symptoms due to insufficientmedication: Tachycardia Tachypnea Elevated blood pressure Cyanosis Decrease in urinary output Incontinence of bowel and bladder Loss of gag reflex Cholinergic crisis is an exacerbation of weakness due to too much choliner-gic medication: Blurred vision Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Abdominal cramping Paleness242 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Twitching of facial muscles Small pupils (miosis) Low blood pressure INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Symptoms are relieved temporarily after administering endrophonium (Tensilon) or neostigmine bromide (Prostigmin) because the drug will allow the acetylcholine tobind at the post-synaptic receptor site on the muscle at which it should normally bind. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are present in greater than 80 percent ofpatients with myasthenia gravis. Electromyography (EMG) shows reduced muscle response to repeatedstimulations. CT scan to rule out thymoma. TREATMENT Administer immunosuppressants to induce remission and help controlsymptoms: prednisone or dexamethasone initially to improve symptoms azathioprine and cyclophosphamide in the long term to help controlsymptoms Administer cholinesterase inhibitors for long-term control of symptoms. Thesedrugs have short duration of action, therefore have to be dosed several timesduring the day: neostigmine pyridostigmine ambenonium Administer natural tears or other lubricant to keep eyes moist: patch eyes if unable to close High-calorie diet of appropriate food type\u2014patient may have difficultyswallowing. Removing antibodies from plasma (plasmapheresis) may be beneficial. BiPAP or CPAP for enhanced air movement and oxygenation. Thymectomy (surgical removal of thymus gland) for patients with thymoma. Avoid aminoglycoside antibiotics which may exacerbate symptoms.243 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired physical mobility Impaired verbal communication Ineffective air exchange Self-care deficit NURSING INTERVENTION Encourage frequent rest periods. Monitor vital signs. Monitor nutritional intake. Monitor weight. Monitor neurologic status for changes in pupil reaction, extraocular move- ments, eyelid movement, facial symmetry, hand grip strength, coordination,fine motor skills, and gait. Monitor respiratory status for changes in rate, effort, skin color, use of acces-sory muscles, or change in mental status. Monitor gag reflex. Arrange for appropriate communication with staff if patient is unable to usecall bell system or unable to be heard over intercom from room. Explain to the patient: Home care needs. Medication use; need to maintain time schedule for medications. Time meals one hour after medications to decrease chance of aspiration. Teach use of oral-pharyngeal suctioning catheter to clear secretions. Avoid heat extremes (hot tubs, saunas). Alcohol may exacerbate symptoms. Parkinson's Disease WHAT WENT WRONG? There is a gradual degeneration of the midbrain area known as the substantia nigra.The neurons use the neurotransmitter dopamine to send their signals from cell to13244 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified cell. The loss of neurons within the substantia nigra continues and results in dimin- ished voluntary fine motor skills due to dopamine loss. There is also developmentof sympathetic noradrenergic lesions, causing norepinephrine loss within the sym-pathetic nervous system. There is excess effect of the excitatory neurotransmitteracetylcholine on the neurons; this causes increased muscle tone, leading to rigid-ity and tremors. There seems to be a genetic tendency towards development ofParkinson's disease. Environmental factors such as exposure to airborne contami-nants, occupational chemicals, toxins, or a virus have been implicated in the devel-opment of the disease. Typical age of onset is after the fifth decade of life. PROGNOSIS Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder and does not have a cure. The symp-toms can be managed with medications, but will return as the medications wear off.The dosages will need to be adjusted periodically, and additional medications maybe needed to address the side effects of the medications used. Some patientsdevelop mental status changes or dementia in conjunction with Parkinson's disease. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Mask-like facial expressions Slow, shuffling gait Pill-rolling movements of hands Stooping posture Tremor at rest Change in handwriting\u2014gets progressively smaller over time Bradykinesia (slow movement) Trouble chewing or swallowing Drooling Inability to control voluntary movement (dyskinesia) and fine-skilled move-ment, or to initiate movement\u2014due to loss of dopamine which has aninhibitory effect and helps refine movements while acetylcholine retains the excitatory effect on the neurons Rigidity of limbs: Cogwheeling\u2014there is a rhythmic stopping or interruption of the move-ment of the extremity Lead pipe\u2014no bending; resists movement completely245 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Orthostatic hypotension due to lack of norepinephrine within the sympa- thetic nervous system, affecting the cardiovascular system INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Cerebrospinal fluid levels may show low levels of dopamine. TREATMENT Administer antiparkinsonian agents which are able to cross the blood-brainbarrier. These drugs absorb better on an empty stomach: levodopa carbidopa-levodopa Administer dopamine receptor agonists inhibitor that slowsthe breakdown of dopamine and allows lower doses of levodopa to be usedbecause it prolongs its effect. Administer catechol breakdown of levodopa: entacapone tolcapone Administer acetylcholine blocking biperiden benztropine mesylate procyclidine orphenadrine trihexyphenidyl Diet high calories. Soft food diet. Physical therapy.246 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING DIAGNOSES Activity intolerance Impaired mobility Risk for injury NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor neurological status for changes. Monitor respiratory status for changes. Encourage self-care, allow patient extra time. Encourage exercise; assist with passive ROM if necessary. Weigh patient. Record food intake. Explain to the patient: Importance of following medication time schedule as well as effects of medication wearing off. Reduce risk of falls at home. Spinal Cord Injury WHAT WENT WRONG? Injury to the spinal cord results in compression, twisting, severing, or pulling on thespinal cord. The damage to the cord may involve the entire thickness of the cord(complete), or only a partial area of the spinal cord (incomplete). The most com-mon cause of spinal cord injury is trauma. Any level of the spinal cord may havebeen affected by the injury. Loss of sensation, motor control, or reflexes may occurbelow the level of injury or within 1 to 2 vertebrae or spinal nerves above the levelof injury. The loss may be unilateral or bilateral. Damage to the vertebrae mayhave occurred at the same time as the spinal cord injury. Swelling due to the ini-tial trauma may make the injury seem more severe than it actually is. When theinitial swelling resolves, the actual degree of permanent injury can be more accu-rately assessed.14247 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System PROGNOSIS The level of injury will determine the degree of disability the patient is likely to sus- tain. A high-level injury, such as a cervical injury, will more likely result in quadra-plegia (paralysis of all four extremities) and compromise of the respiratory drive.A complete spinal cord injury will result in greater disability than an incompleteinjury. Spinal cord tissue does not regenerate after an injury. Swelling that occursimmediately following an injury may be controlled with medications and someclinical improvement may occur, but the damage to the cord cannot be undone. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Loss of motor control due to damage to the anterior horn of the spinal cord Loss of reflexes due to damage of the spinal cord, the point of synaptic trans-mission of sensory impulse to motor response Flaccid paralysis Lack of bowel and bladder control Altered sensation (tingling\u2014paresthesia; diminished\u2014hypoesthesia; in-creased\u2014hyperesthesia) Bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia due to problems with the autonomicnervous system INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS MRI shows vertebral or spinal cord injury and edema. CT scan shows vertebral or spinal cord injury and edema. TREATMENT Immobilize the affected area of the spinal cord to decrease chance of furtherirritation. Place the patient in a flat position to avoid flexion or misalignment of thespine. Monitor traction or collar to prevent skin irritation. Administer corticosteroid to decrease inflammation at point of injury: methylprednisolone248 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified prednisone dexamethasone Administer dextran, a plasma expander, which increases blood flow in the spinal cord, increasing oxygenation to the tissue. Assist respirations if indicated. Administer H2 receptor antagonists to protect stomach from stress ulcer formation: cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, coat stomach lining: sucralfate Place patient in a rotation bed for repositioning to prevent pressure on skin. Surgical repair of vertebral fracture or decompression may be necessary. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired physical mobility Powerlessness NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor respiratory status\u2014assess for changes in rate, effort, use of acces-sory muscles, cyanosis, altered mental status, and pulse oximetry reading. Monitor neurologic status for changes\u2014assess sensation, temperature, touch,position sense, comparing right to left. Monitor for spinal shock: Flaccid paralysis, loss of reflexes below the level of injury, hypotension,bradycardia, possible paralytic ileus. Monitor pulse and blood pressure for changes\u2014change in heart rate, hypo-tension, or hypertension. Assess skin for signs of pressure (redness) or breakdown. Assess abdomen and listen for bowel sounds. Explain to the patient: Importance of regular bowel and bladder function to avoid autonomicdysreflexia due to distension: severe headache, hypertension, bradycardia,flushing, nasal congestion, sweating, nausea. Use of incentive spirometer.249 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Need for turning and positioning or special rotating bed to decrease pressure. Monitor intake and output. Home care needs\u2014accessibility, equipment needs. Proper way to transfer from bed to wheelchair. Care of pin sites for cervical traction devices (e.g. halo traction). Stroke WHAT WENT WRONG? A stroke is also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CV A) or a brain attack. Blood supply is interrupted to part of the brain, causing brain cells to die; this results in thepatient losing brain function in the affected area. Interruption is usually caused byan obstruction of arterial blood flow (ischemic stroke), such as formation of a bloodclot, but can also be caused by a leaking or ruptured blood vessel (hemorrhagicstroke). A blood clot may develop from a piece of unstable plaque lining a vesselwall that breaks free, or an embolus that travels from elsewhere in the body andlodges within the vessel. The bleeding may occur as a result of trauma or sponta-neously, as in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension. Ischemia occurs when insuf-ficient blood is getting to the brain tissue. This leads to lack of available oxygen(hypoxia) and glucose (hypoglycemia) for the brain. When these nutrients are notavailable for a sustained period, the brain cells die, causing an area of infarction.Permanent deficits result from infarction. There is increased risk for stroke inpatients with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, atrialfibrillation, obesity, smoking, or oral contraceptive use. Patients may also experience a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in which the symptoms result from a temporary problem with blood flow to a specific area ofthe brain. The symptoms have a duration between a few minutes and 24 hours. PROGNOSIS The degree of damage and location of the stroke will determine the outcome for thepatient. Strokes occur suddenly and patients should seek immediate treatment forthe best possible outcome. The majority of strokes are ischemic. Rapid entry intothe healthcare system and treatment with thrombolytic agents (unless there are con-traindications to this treatment) to break up a clot that has caused the ischemia gives15250 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified the patient the best chance for recovery without permanent disability. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke may need surgery to relieve intracranial pressure or stop the bleeding. A large area of damage may lead to significant permanent disabilityor death. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Mental impairment Disorientation, confusion Emotional changes, personality changes Aphasia (difficulty with speech; may be receptive, expressive) Slurring of words Sensory changes (paresthesia, visual changes, hearing changes) Unilateral numbness or weakness in face or limbs Seizure Severe headache due to increased intracranial pressure from hemorrhage TIA symptoms are similar but have a shorter duration and resolve INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CT scan identifies area of bleeding (usually for emergency use). MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) identifies location of ischemic areas(slower than CT scan). MRA (magnetic resonance angiography) can identify abnormal vasculatureor vasospasm. Diffusion/perfusion MRI or MRA will show areas that are not getting ade-quate blood supply, but have not yet suffered an infarction. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) will show an areathat is not perfusing adequately TREATMENT It is most important to determine whether the patient has suffered an ischemic orhemorrhagic stroke as the treatment is different. Giving a thrombolytic agent to thepatient who has had a hemorrhagic stroke will only cause further bleeding into251 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System the brain. Caution is also recommended in patients with head trauma, uncontrolled hypertension, hemorrhagic retinopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, recent surgery,recent MI, or pregnancy. Administer TPA (thromoblytic agent) within 3 hours of onset of symptoms,unless contraindicated. Administer anticoagulants for patients with ischemic stroke after use of TPA: heparin, warfarin, low-molecular decrease swelling: dexamethasone (Decadron) Physical therapy to help maintain muscle tone or return function. Speech therapy to help with speech and swallowing. Occupational therapy to help regain function. Bed rest to reduce chance of injury. Adequate nutrition in appropriate food type for patient. Carotid artery endarterectomy to remove plaque from within the carotid arteryif stenosis is present. Stenting of carotid Surgical correction of arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, intracranialbleeding. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for injury Ineffective tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for changes.

Assess for neglect syndrome\u2014patient may act as if unaware of the sideaffected by paralysis due to the stroke. Need for rehabilitation to return to prior functional ability. Explain to the patient: Home care needs. Proper technique to transfer from bed to chair. Use of ambulatory assist devices: cane, crutch, walker. Special dietary needs; use of Thick-it \u00aefor liquids. Medication schedule, use, side effects, and interactions. Seizure Disorder WHAT WENT WRONG? This is a disorder that involves a sudden episode of abnormal, uncontrolled dis-charge of the electrical activity of the neurons within the brain. The patient mayexperience a variety of symptoms depending on the type of seizure and the cause.16253 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Seizures may be a symptom of another condition\u2014such as a tumor or stroke which has increased the intracranial pressure, a metabolic disorder, withdrawalfrom alcohol or drugs\u2014or may be due to a chronic seizure disorder such asepilepsy. Prior to the seizure, the patient may experience an aura, a sensory alter-ation involving sight, sound, or smell. After the seizure, the patient enters a post-ictal stage where there may be confusion and the patient is often fatigued. Thepatient may not recall any of the seizure or the time immediately surrounding the seizure. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS EEG (electroencephalogram) to identify areas of abnormal electrical activitywithin the brain. CT scan of the brain to identify causes of increased intracranial pressure(rule out tumor or bleed). MRI to identify causes of increased intracranial pressure (rule out tumor orbleed). PET (positron emission tomography) or SPECT (single photon emissioncomputed tomography) to determine areas in the brain that are not ade-quately perfused.Generalized seizures Tonic clonic Begins with tonic (stiffening/rigidity of muscles of limbs), loss of consciousness, then clonic (rhythmic jerking) Tonic Stiffening or rigidity of muscles; loss of consciousness Clonic Rhythmic jerking of muscle contraction and relaxation Absence Brief loss of conscious awareness and staring into space; appears to be daydreaming Myoclonic Brief stiffening or jerking of extremity, either single or in groups Atonic Loss of muscle tone Partial seizures Simple partial Begins with aura; may have unilateral unusual sensation or move- ment of extremity, autonomic (heart rate, flushing), or psychic changes; no loss of consciousness Complex partial Loss of consciousness; automatisms (lip smacking, picking, patting)254 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT If there is an underlying condition causing the disorder, removal of this condition will often result in resolution of the disorder. The patient with a primary seizuredisorder will typically be managed with anticonvulsant medications. Some patientswill need multi-drug regimens to adequately control the seizure disorder. Patientswho do not respond to multiple antiepileptic drugs may be per Maintain IV access with saline lock if no intravenous fluids needed for hos-pitalized patients. Surgery to remove seizure focal area or sever the connection between the cere-bral hemispheres (corpus callostomy) to limit the amount of seizure activityfor patients who do not have adequate control of seizures with medications. Vagal nerve stimulation where there is implantation of an electrical devicethat provides a predetermined pattern of vagal stimulation. This is used todecrease the frequency of seizures. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for ineffective breathing pattern or airway clearance255 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System Risk for fall Anxiety NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor patient during the seizure for breathing, skin color (cyanosis)\u2014 patient may have diminished oxygenation during seizure. May need supplemental oxygen post-seizure. Keep oxygen equipment and suction equipment and emergency airway man-agement equipment at bedside (intubation may be performed by anesthesi-ologist, nurse anesthetist, or respiratory therapist). Monitor duration of seizure and progression of symptoms. Monitor for incontinence of bladder or bowel. Monitor for status epilepticus\u2014prolonged seizures or repeated seizures,considered a medical emergency. Position patient to decrease risk of injury: remove objects that may injure patient. turn patient on side to reduce risk of aspiration. do not insert anything in patient's mouth during seizure. Assess the patient post-seizure. Explain to the patient: Medication use, side effects, and interactions. Importance of taking medications on time, not skipping doses. Importance of checking with prescriber before taking any new medica-tions or over-the-counter (OTC) medications or supplements. Have lab tests for drug level of antiepileptic drugs checked as directed. Crucial Diagnostic Tests X-ray An x-ray of the skull or spine is done to determine the presence of fracture, dis-location, calcification into soft tissue areas, degree of curvature (normal antero-posterior curve of areas of the spine, versus lateral curvature of scoliosis).256 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified CT scan with or without Contrast Practitioner may do an initial test without contrast for first images and then give contrast and repeat images to compare. Done to check for bleeding, tumor, abscess,infarction, and hydrocephalus. CT Angiography This creates a three-dimensional reconstruction of the vasculature within the areaimaged. Cerebral Angiography Contrast is injected to visualize the cerebral circulation, carotid, and vertebralarteries. This test is done to identify aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations,traumatic injuries, strictures, occlusions, and tumors. The head is immobilized during the test. Wire is inserted via the femoral arte- rial site and passed to the carotid or vertebral vessel under fluoroscopic guidance.Contrast dye is injected so three-dimensional images can be obtained. After the test, you need to monitor vital signs and perform neurologic checks and neurovascular checks of the extremity (capillary refill, peripheral pulses, skincolor, and temperature). Check for bleeding at the site. EEG This test records the electrical activity from the cerebral hemispheres of the brain andcreates a graphic recording. It determines general brain activity as well as the site oforigin of seizure activity. It is also used to diagnose sleep disorders and determinebrain death. Lumbar Puncture A spinal needle is inserted into subarachnoid space at level of L3-L4 or L4-L5with patient lying on side with knees drawn up to chest. This test is performedunder local anesthesia.257 CHAPTER 5 Nervous System It is done to obtain pressure readings, obtain cerebrospinal fluid for analysis, inject contrast medium or air for diagnostic tests, inject medications, or reduce increased intracranial pressure. The patient must lie flat for several hours after the procedure to reduce the risk of spinal headache due to leakage of spinal fluid. Encourage oral fluid intake. MRI with Gadolinium This test is done to detect differences in tissue integrity, tumors, and disc disease.Due to the use of a magnetic field to create images, an MRI is not for patients withimplanted hardware (pacemakers, etc.) or for pregnant women. MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography) This is done to detect arterial blockages, aneurysm, and arteriovenous mal-formations. PET (Positron Emission Tomography) PET tells about the function of the brain involving glucose and oxygen metabo-lism. The test is done to detect areas of altered metabolism such as dementia,epilepsy, neoplasm, or degenerative disorders. The patient is given a tagged isotope on deoxyglucose. There will be increased glucose uptake by areas with increased metabolic activity. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) SPECT involves an intravenous injection of a radiopharmaceutical to enhance the image. It is done to detect cerebral blood flow, stroke, dementia, amnesia, neo-plasm, head trauma, seizures, persistent vegetative state, brain death, and psychi-atric disorders. This test is not for pregnant women.258 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Quiz 1. A patient arrived in the ER with a head injury. She is unconscious.

Click here for terms of use. 262 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified How the Musculoskeletal System Works The musculoskeletal system provides both structure and function for the body. The bones protect and support the vital organs. The skeleton is divided into the axialand appendicular areas. The axial skeleton protects the vital organs, surroundingthe central nervous system and thoracic cavity. The appendicular skeleton attachesto the axial skeleton and consists primarily of the limbs. Bones are classified byboth their shape and their composition. Short bones (like the phalanges) are foundin the fingers and toes. Long bones (like the humerus or femur) are found in thelimbs. Irregular bones are named for their shapes and are found in the joints ofthe ankle or wrist and in the middle ear. Flat bones (ribs or scapula) protect innerorgans. The outer layer of bone tissue is a dense compact bone tissue called theCarpal Tunnel Syndrome FracturesGoutOsteoarthritisOsteomyelitisOsteoporosis 1 2 34 5 6 Key Terms Abduction AdductionBursaCartilageCircumductionConnective tissuesEversionExtensionFlexionInversionOsteoblastsOsteoclastsPronationRotationSupinationSynovial jointsSynoviumTendonsLearning Objectives263 CHAPTER 6 Musculoskeletal System cortex. Blood supply for the bone travels through small blood vessels within haversian canals located longitudinally within the cortical bone area. The inner layeris more spongy, cancellous tissue which has spaces filled with marrow. Productionof blood cells occurs within the red bone marrow. Yellow bone marrow is composedprimarily of fat cells. Osteoblasts (bone-building cells) and osteoclasts (bone-resorb-ing cells) are found in the outer layer of the bone. Joints are the areas where two or more bones come together. Joints are described as being freely movable (synovial joints like the hip), partially movable (pelvicbones), or immovable (suture lines in the skull). Synovial joints are lined with syn-ovium. This membrane secretes synovial fluid to lubricate the joint and act as ashock absorber during motion or weight bearing. Synovial joints have a variety ofrange of motion including flexion, extension, rotation, inversion, and eversion. Partially movable jointshave specific small amounts of motion that are typical of the joint space. Pelvicbones and individual joints between the vertebral bones are partially movable. Im-movable joints are areas where bones come together, but no movement is allowed. Muscles work in groups, with one set of muscles relaxing as another set con- tracts to create motion. A small amount of muscle contraction is typical to main-tain muscle tone within the muscles. Skeletal muscle is striated and voluntary.Connective tissues are the pieces that hold other parts together. Tendons attachmuscles to bones; ligaments attach bones to bones. Cartilage provides a smoothsurface within joints to ease movement and provide cushioning to weight-bearingjoints. Bursa are small fluid-filled sacs, within joint areas or adjacent to bonewhich provide cushioning at points of friction. Just the Facts Carpal Tunnel Syndrome WHAT WENT WRONG? The median nerve that passes through the carpal tunnel in the anterior wrist iscompressed, resulting in pain and a numb sensation in the thumb, index finger,middle finger, and lateral aspect of the fourth finger in the hand. This is often theresult of repetitive hand motions and may be work- or hobby-related. Carpal tunnelsyndrome tends to be more common in women.1264 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Some patients respond to conservative treatments including nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory medications and rest of the affected area. A wrist brace may help tokeep the wrist in a neutral position during this time. If this conservative treat-ment fails, the patient may need surgery to decompress the carpal tunnel area torelieve pressure on the nerve as it passes through the wrist into the hand. Long-term presence of carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to atrophy of muscles in thepalm of the hand. Hand grip strength may be affected. After treatment, carpal tun-nel syndrome may recur in the future. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Tingling, numbness, or burning sensation (paresthesia) in the hand due tonerve compression Weakness in the hand due to nerve compression and, eventually, musclewasting Pain in the hand due to nerve compression Tapping over the carpal tunnel area will cause tingling, numbness, or painthrough the palm and affected fingers (Tinnel's sign) Pain, tingling, and burning sensation in the wrist and hand as a result of theblood pressure cuff being inflated on the upper arm to the level of the patient'ssystolic blood pressure INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction studies will show nerve dys-function. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will show swelling of the median nervewithin the carpal tunnel. TREATMENT Splint the wrist for 2 weeks to keep the wrist in a neutral position or slightlyextended and decrease compression on the carpal tunnel area. Administer NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pre-dnisone Some are given orally. Some may be injected into the carpal tunnel area. Surgery when decompression of the carpal tunnel is necessary to relieve pres-sure on the median nerve. NURSING DIAGNOSES Pain Impaired mobility Disturbed sensory perception: tactile NURSING INTERVENTION Assist the patient with hygiene if necessary before sur gical correction and with postoperative dressings after surgery. Patients wearing wrist splints may need assistance with certain activities ofdaily living (ADLs). Assist the patient in exercising the hand; encourage performance of activi-ties through physical therapy. Monitor the motion and sensation in the hand following surgery\u2014check cap-illary refill, color, and sensation of fingers. Encourage movement of fingers after surgery. Monitor postoperative dressing for drainage. Explain to the patient: Use, interactions, and side effects of anti-inflammatory medications. Proper use of wrist splints. Encourage appropriate exercises. Use of ergonomic devices, such as wrist rests or keyboard trays for com-puter work.266 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Fractures WHAT WENT WRONG? Excess stress or direct trauma is placed on a bone, causing a break. This results in damage to surrounding muscles and tissue, leading to hemorrhage, edema, and localtissue damage. Initially after the fracture, bleeding in the area leads to hematomaformation at the site. Inflammatory cells enter the area. Granulation tissue replacesthe hematoma. Cellular changes continue and a non-bony union known as a callusdevelops. Osteoblasts continue to enter the area. Fibrous tissue in the fracturedarea changes to bone. The fracture site may be just a crack in the bone, without displacing any of the bone itself. A fracture that does not go all the way through the bone is consideredan incomplete fracture. The fracture may also go all the way through a bone, break-ing it into two (or more) pieces, which is referred to as a complete fracture. Thesurrounding muscle tissue that attaches above and below the fracture area in a limbwill continue to create tension on their attachment points to the bone and pull thepieces further out of alignment. Some fractured bone pieces may penetrate throughthe skin; this is known as an open or compound fracture. Those that do not pene-trate the skin are considered closed or simple fractures. PROGNOSIS The area of fracture needs to be identified (via an x-ray) and properly treated inorder to heal. The fractured area typically needs to be realigned and then immobi-lized to allow for proper healing. During this time of immobilization, the bonecells come into the area to rebuild new bone to repair the damaged area. The periodof immobilization typically lasts for 6 to 8 weeks, depending on the site and degreeof damage. The full structural strength is not typically restored until months afterthe break, depending on the size and location of the fracture. Time for full healingvaries from 6 weeks in young healthy adults with simple fractures to a couple ofmonths in older patients with other health problems. Older patients have a signif-icant increase in both morbidity and mortality following a hip fracture. Complications following fractures include compartment syndrome, fat embo- lism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), delayed union, nonunion, or misalignment.Compartment syndrome occurs when excess pressure builds up within a musclecompartment sheath. The pressure may be coming from internal or externalsources of pressure. This is most common with fractures involving the lower leg2267 CHAPTER 6 Musculoskeletal System or lower arm. Fat globules may be released from the yellow bone marrow into the bloodstream and embolize to other areas of the body. The risk for this is highest inthe elderly and in men between 18 and 40. Decrease in mobility following fracturewill increase the risk for DVT. Smoking, obesity, heart disease, and lower extrem-ity surgery all increase this risk. Delayed union is when a fracture has not joinedwithin 6 months, despite appropriate treatments. Nonunion is a fracture site thatfails to completely heal. Misalignment is when the fracture site heals, but theanatomic alignment is not as it should be. Muscle wasting may occur in the area that has been immobilized. Physical ther- apy can be very helpful for the patient to regain full functional strength of the area. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Local bleeding\u2014may or may not see skin level discoloration; it depends onamount of blood loss and distance between fracture and skin Edema at site due to inflammatory reaction to tissue damage Abnormal range of motion\u2014need intact bone in order for muscle to pull andcreate movement; if fracture occurs near joint, swelling may limit ROM Shortening of the leg and external rotation is common following hip fracture INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS X-ray shows fracture\u2014may be displaced or not. CT scan shows fracture\u2014useful when patient's body part cannot be turnedor positioned for imaging (e.g. the neck). Bone scan will show increased cellular activity in area of fracture\u2014usefulfor sites where fracture not easily seen or for hairline fractures not previouslydiagnosed. TREATMENT Immobilize broken bone\u2014to stabilize area, initially may be done with splintuntil fracture reduced (replaced into proper position) and cast applied or fix-ation device applied surgically. Open reduction is the surgical repair and direct visual realignment of fracture. Pain management as needed.268 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for impaired skin integrity Risk for activity intolerance Impaired physical mobility NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor circulation: check peripheral pulses, capillary refill, and skin tem- perature distal to the Compromise of blood flow will diminish pulses,slow capillary refill and cause cool skin temperature. Compare bilateral areasfor symmetry. Monitor vital signs: check for elevated pulse, low BP, and elevated respira-tory rate. The broken bone ends can lacerate a vessel causing internal bleed-ing; monitor for signs of shock. May see elevated temperature with infectionfrom open fracture. Explain to the patient: How to provide self-care\u2014depending on the fracture area, the patient'sability to care for himself or herself may be compromised. The importance of performing range-of-motion exercise to maintain mus-cle tone in the areas not immobilized. Not to insert anything into the cast. The padding may become dislodged,causing pressure points under the hard cast which would lead to skinbreakdown. The skin integrity may also be broken when scratching underthe cast, leading to an infection. Gout WHAT WENT WRONG? This is a metabolic disorder in which the body does not properly metabolizepurine-based proteins. As a result, there is an increase in the amount of uric acid,which is the end product of purine metabolism. As a result of hyperuricemia,uric acid crystals accumulate in joints, most commonly the big toe (podagra), causing pain when the joint moves. Uric acid is cleared from the body through 3269 CHAPTER 6 Musculoskeletal System the kidneys. These patients may also develop kidney stones as the uric acid crys- tallizes in the kidney. A person may also develop secondary gout. This is due to another disease pro- cess or use of medication, such as thiazide diuretics or some chemotherapeuticagents. PROGNOSIS Gout is typically a chronic disorder. Patients need to understand the disease and itstreatment so that medications can be initiated at the earliest point during a painfulflare. Repeated flares in the same joint will ultimately cause joint damage. Chronicelevation of serum uric acid is associated with progression of atherosclerosis. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Acute onset of excruciating pain in joint due to accumulation of uric acidwithin the joint Redness due to inflammation around the joint Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) due to uric acid deposits in the kidney INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Elevated serum uric acid level\u2014not seen in all patients with gout. Typical ofprimary gout patients prior to episode of acute joint pain. Elevated urinary uric acid levels. Arthrocentesis shows uric acid crystals within the joint fluid. TREATMENT Acute treatment is managed with colchicine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorymedications. These medications are continued until the pain is controlled. Chronicgout is treated with allopurinol or an uricosuric agent to reduce the amount ofuricacid in the system. These medications are used in the long term to reduce the amount of painful flares that occur.270 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Administer colchicine during an acute episode to decrease the inflammatory response resulting from uric acid deposits. This will help reduce pain. Administer NSAID to decrease inflammation to aid in pain relief indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen Not aspirin; regular acid. Administer xanthine oxidase inhibitor medication to reduce total body uricacid. Given as long-term treatment to patients with recurrent episodes of gout: allopurinol Administer uricosuric medications when the total body amount of urateneeds to be decreased. Not used in patients who are already excreting a largeamount of uric acid. Given to patients recurrentepisodes: Immobilize the joint for comfort. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired mobility Acute pain NURSING INTERVENTION Have the patient drink 3 liters of fluid per day to avoid crystallization of uricacid in the kidneys. Increased fluids help flush the uric acid through thekidneys. Monitor uric acid levels in serum. Assist with positioning for comfort. Avoid touching inflamed joint unnecessarily. May need to keep clothing orbed linen away from area. Explain to patient: Which foods are high-purine proteins\u2014turkey, organ meats, sardines,smelts, mackerel, anchovies, herring, bacon. Avoid alcohol, which inhibits renal excretion of uric acid.271 CHAPTER 6 Musculoskeletal System Osteoarthritis WHAT WENT WRONG? A degenerative joint disease caused by the wear and tear of the articular cartilage. As the protective joint cartilage is worn away, the underlying bone becomes ex-posed, causing the exposed bones to rub. Degenerative changes within the bonetissue produce small areas of re-growth, causing jagged joint spaces and bone spurs.These rough areas project out into soft tissue or joint spaces, causing pain. PROGNOSIS Pain associated with osteoarthritis typically is related to activity and is relievedwith rest. The major weight-bearing joints are more affected in overweight patientsdue to the excess wear and tear on the joints, especially affecting hips and knees.Initially patients respond well to rest periods and over-the-counter medications forpain control. As joints become more damaged over time, a joint replacement maybe necessary to correct pain and to improve quality of life and mobility. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Stiff joints for short time in morning, usually 15 minutes or less due to changeswithin joints Joint pain with movement or weight bearing due to joint remodeling Crepitus (grating feeling on palpation over joint during range of motion) dueto loss of articular cartilage and bony overgrowth in joint Pain relief when joints are rested because lack of movements will relieve irri-tation in joint space Enlargement of joint due to bony overgrowth or remodeling Heberden's nodes\u2014swelling of the distal interphalangeal joints INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS X-ray shows narrowed joint spaces, bone spurs, or osteophytes around joints. Tests for inflammation will be normal\u2014erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein.4272 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Initial treatment is usually with over-the-counter medications. The patients re- spond well to these medications. There is no underlying inflammatory disorder, sothe medications can be used on an as-needed basis. Many of the patients are older and will be on other medications, so it is important that you check for medicationinteractions. Administer NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug)\u2014for any localinflammation from irritation at the pain relief. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate for relief of pain and stiffness. Capsaicin cream topically. Intra-articular injections of corticosteroid up to 3 or 4 times in a year. Intra-articular injections of: hyaluronate sodium; series of 3 to 5 injections hyaluron; series of 3 injections hylan GF 20; series of 3 injections Exercise to maintain joint mobility and muscle tone. Walking aid for stability. NURSING DIAGNOSES Pain Activity intolerance Impaired mobility NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor pain to adequately treat pain, as needs may change. Diet modification for weight loss for overweight patients to decrease excessstress on weight-bearing joints.273 CHAPTER 6 Musculoskeletal System Explain to the patient: When and how to take medications. Importance of maintaining activity. Disease process. Osteomyelitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone. In an adult, it is most commonly due to direct contamination of the site during trauma, such as an open fracture. Bacteriathat cause infections elsewhere in the body may also enter the bloodstream andbecome deposited into the bone, starting a secondary infection site there. This ismore common in children and adolescents. Some of the patients have been treatedwith antibiotics previously for the initial infection. The causative organism is not always identified. More than three-quarters of the identified organisms are Staphylococcus aureus . Acute infection is associated with inflammatory changes in the bone and may lead to necrosis. Some patients willdevelop chronic osteomyelitis. PROGNOSIS The sooner the infected area can be made infection-free, the better the prognosisfor the patient. There is a risk for developing chronic osteomyelitis. This risk isgreater in patients with a compromised immune system or poor blood supply tothe area (such as diabetics). HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Pain Fever, chills Malaise INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Elevated white blood count (WBC). X-ray osteolytic lesions (localized loss of bone density).5274 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Bone scan shows area of increased cellular activity\u2014detects site of infection . Culture and sensitivity tests to determine the infecting organism and anti- biotic\u2014may be difficult to determine infecting organism . Bone biopsy to identify organism . TREATMENT Removal of necrotic bone tissue and local pus or drainage is often necessary tospeed healing. Typically, patients need antibiotics for several weeks to properlytreat the infection. Debridement of the area to remove necrotic tissue. Drain the infected site. Immobilize or stabilize the bone if necessary. Administer antibiotics parenterally for 4 to 6 weeks or orally for 6 to 8weeks: nafcillin, or gangrene, amputation may be needed. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired mobility Activity intolerance NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs, changes in blood pressure, elevated pulse, elevated tem-perature and respiratory rate. Monitor wound site for redness, drainage, and odor. Monitor IV access site for patency.275 CHAPTER 6 Musculoskeletal System Explain to the patient: When and how to take medications. Importance of completing antibiotic medication. How to flush venous access device. Signs of infiltration, clotting of venous access device. When to call for assistance with venous access. Osteoporosis WHAT WENT WRONG? This is a decrease in bone density, making bones more brittle and increasing the risk of fracture. The body continuously replaces older bone with new bone througha balance between the osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. When bone-buildingactivity does not keep up with bone-resorption activity, the structural integrity ofthe bone is compromised. Increased age, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, having a small frame, being Caucasian, Asian, or female all increase the risk of osteoporosis. Osteoporosiscan also occur as a secondary disease, due to another condition. These causesinclude use of medications such as corticosteroids or some anticonvulsants, hor-monal disorders (Cushing's or thyroid), and prolonged immobilization. PROGNOSIS The risk of fracture is significantly increased in patients with osteoporosis. Themost common fracture sites in patients with osteoporosis are hip, vertebrae, pelvis,and distal radius. Some fractures such as vertebral compression fractures affectquality of life. There is increased morbidity and mortality in patients who sus-tain a hip fracture. The cost of healthcare for these patients is significant, andincludes the immediate care of the fracture as well as the necessary rehabilitation. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic Back pain due to compression fractures in vertebral bodies6276 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Loss of height Excessive forward curvature of the thoracic spine (kyphosis) due to patho- logic vertebral fractures; collapsing of the anterior portion of the vertebralbodies in the thoracic area Fracture with minor trauma INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS X-ray shows demineralization of the bone\u2014not an early sign. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) shows decrease in bone mineraldensity in the hip and spine compared to young normal patients, and com-pared to age-matched, race-matched, sex-matched patients. TREATMENT It is much more cost-effective to focus on prevention of osteoporosis. Encourageadequate exercise and nutrition. Calcium supplementation may be necessary forpatients who are not getting the recommended daily requirement of calcium in thediet. The body stores calcium in the bones. If there is insufficient dietary intake,the body will remove the calcium from the bone, further weakening the structuralintegrity. Once osteoporosis occurs, proper medical management is important toprevent fractures and increase bone density. Administer bisphosphonate drugs to osteoclastic bone Administer calcitonin nasal spray to increase bone density, also has analgesiceffect on bone pain after 2 to 4 weeks. Administer selective estrogen receptor modulator for postmenopausal womenfor prevention of osteoporosis: raloxifene teriparatide to stimulate the production of collagenous bone toincrease bone density. Administer vitamin D, which enhances the absorption of calcium; manypatients with osteoporosis are also deficient in vitamin D.277 CHAPTER 6 Musculoskeletal System Administer calcium, 1000 to 1500 mg per day in divided doses to enhance absorption. Encourage weight-bearing activity. Perform range-of-motion activities. Increase vitamins and calcium in diet. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired mobility Pain Risk for injury NURSING INTERVENTION Pain control if fracture occurs. Explain to the patient: How to properly take medications. Bisphosphonates must be taken first thing in the morning on an emptystomach, with a full glass of water. The patient can't lie down for 30 to 60minutes after taking the medication; this is to reduce risk of esophagealirritation. Monitor for side effects of medications\u2014GI effects with bisphosphonates. Encourage weight-bearing activity. Encourage appropriate nutrition. Crucial Diagnostic Tests X-ray Body part to be imaged needs to be positioned properly to see underlying bonestructure, identify fractures, and detect foreign bodies. The patient may need to lie,sit, or stand, depending on the body part to be imaged. Typically, two differentviews are taken of the same body part to allow better diagnostics.278 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Arthrogram An x-ray of a joint area is taken after the injection of a contrast medium has been injected into the joint space to enhance its visibility. In a double-contrast study, asolution is injected, followed by air. This may be done to better assess the possi-bility of bone chips or torn ligaments within the joint space. Determine if the patient has a history of allergy to contrast prior to the test. Arthroscopy Fiberoptic scope used to visually examine the joint, performed under sometype of anesthesia (local, epidural, conscious sedation, or general). This is done to perform surgery concurrently, diagnose injuries to joint spaces,and assess response to prior treatments. Postprocedure, check neurovascular status of the extremity\u2014color, pulses,sensation, motion, and temperature. Teach patient to monitor for signs of infection\u2014redness, swelling, fever, andincreased pain. Biopsy A tissue sample is taken from a body part (muscle or bone) to determine diseasestate of tissue. The sample may be taken through closed (needle) biopsy or open(incisional) biopsy. It is done to determine the presence of infection, cancer, muscular atrophy or inflammation, or presence of mitochondrial disorders. Bone Scan This is a peripheral intravenous injection of bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical fol-lowed by 2- to 3-hour delayed imaging. Patient must lie still for the duration of thescanning, about 30 to 60 minutes. It is done to diagnose osteomyelitis, bone tumors, metastatic disease, fractures, and unexplained skeletal pain.279 CHAPTER 6 Musculoskeletal System Encourage fluids after the injection to flush the radiopharmaceutical. Monitor for reaction to the radiopharmaceutical: rash, itching, hives, and so on. Computed Tomography (CT) Scan Computerized axial tomography\u2014computer-manipulated pictures of radiologic images that are not obstructed by overlying anatomy. The patient needs to lie stillduring the exam for clear images. This is done to detect fractures and bone metastasis. Electromyography (EMG) Multiple small needle-type electrodes are inserted into muscle areas to test mus-cle potential. The patient may be asked to move the area to allow for measurementduring minimal and maximal contraction of the muscle. The amount of muscle andnerve activity is recorded graphically. Explain to the patient that there may be some discomfort during the testing. Certain medications may need to be stopped prior to testing: muscle relaxants, stim-ulants, caffeine. After the testing, the patient may complain of pain or anxiety.The test is done to detect neuromuscular, peripheral nerve disorders, or lower motor neuron disorders, and may be done in conjunction with nerve conductionstudies. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Use of a super-conducting magnet and radio frequency signals cause hydrogennuclei to send out an individual signal. As the radio waves bounce off the tissuesin the body, different signals are sent based on the density of the tissues. The computer will create detailed images based on the information it receives. Contrastmay be injected intravenously. The MRI diagnoses problems within joints, soft tissue (tendons, ligaments), spine, intervertebral discs, and spinal cord. Prior to the test, ask the patient about possible metallic objects (surgical clips, implants), pacemakers or implanted infusion pumps (may cause dysfunction ofdevices), or pregnancy.280 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Ask the patient about history of claustrophobia: closed machines are somewhat restrictive, while open machines are less claustrophobic. Tests typically last 60 minutes or longer. Myelography This is an injection of contrast medium into the subarachnoid space of the spine toallow for better visualization of the vertebral column, intervertebral discs, andspinal nerves. This is done when the patient is not a candidate for MRI or CT scan. Posttesting, the patient typically is sitting to keep the contrast medium low in the spinal column, away from the brain. Ultrasound Sound waves are used to generate an image. This is done to determine the pres-ence and location of mass, fluid, or surgical hardware. Quiz 1. Patients who work in settings that require repetition of the same hand movements over a long period of time have an increased risk for which ofthe following disorders? (a) osteomyelitis.(b) osteoporosis.(c) carpal tunnel syndrome.(d) facture of the overused area. 2. You are caring for a patient who has just had open carpal tunnel release sur- gery. The surgeon has requested that the patient's hand and arm remain ele- vated above the level of the heart after the surgery. This is to: (a) reduce lymphatic drainage.(b) reduce postoperative swelling.(c) restrict decrease possibility of nosocomial infection.281 CHAPTER 6 Musculoskeletal System 3. In obtaining the patient history for your patient with carpal tunnel syn- drome, you would expect to note a history of: (a) pain and numbness or tingling sensation in the hand (over the palmar surface of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and lateral aspect of the ring finger) that is worse at night. (b) crepitus (grating feeling on palpation over joint during range of motion) due to loss of articular cartilage and bony overgrowth in joint. (c) excessive forward curvature of the thoracic spine (kyphosis) due to pathologic vertebral fractures, and collapsing of the anterior portion ofthe vertebral bodies in the thoracic area. (d) acute onset of excruciating pain in joint due to accumulation of uric acid within the joint. 4. Initial treatment of the patient with a fracture should include: (a) surgical reduction of the fracture. (b) insertion of internal fixation device.(c) reduction of the fracture.(d) immobilization of the area. 5. The first priority of care of the patient with a new fracture includes assessing: (a) respiratory rate and effort, pulse.(b) the fracture site for bleeding.(c) for signs of infection at the wound site of an open fracture.(d) for circulation and sensation distal to the fracture site. 6. Patients with a history of osteoporosis have an increased risk for: (a) infection in the bone.(b) peripheral blood clot formation.(c) painful joint inflammation.(d) fracture formation. 7. Teaching patients about proper use of bisphosphonate medications for treatment of osteoporosis should include taking medication: (a) on a full stomach.(b) first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a full glass of water, 30 to 60 minutes before eating, without lying down. (c) just before getting into bed. (d) with an acidic liquid, like orange juice.282 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified 8. In order to allow for proper healing, patients with osteomyelitis may need to have: (a) debridement and drainage of the area.(b) immobilization of the area.(c) ice packs alternating with moist heat applied externally.(d) internal fixation device inserted. 9. You have been caring for a patient with osteomyelitis. In preparing the patient for discharge, you include teaching about: (a) the importance of multiple-week treatment with antibiotics.(b) the side effects and interactions of the medications.(c) symptoms that necessitate a call to the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. (d) all of the above. 10. The patient with gout will have periodic exacerbations of painful joint in- flammation.

Click here for terms of use. 284 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified How the Gastrointestinal System Works The gastrointestinal system includes the alimentary canal (mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum) and accessory organs (salivaryglands, liver, pancreas, gallbladder) and ducts. The alimentary canal is a hollowtube lined with mucous membrane. The gastrointestinal tract functions to digestfood, absorb nutrients, propel the contents through the lumen, and eliminate thewaste (GERD) Gastrointestinal bleed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 11 12 13 14 15 16Learning Objectives285 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Digestion of food has both mechanical and chemical components. Both pro- cesses begin in the mouth. Chewing, movement through the gastrointestinal tract, and churning within the stomach are parts of the mechanical process. Saliva,hydrochloric acid, bile, and other digestive enzymes all contribute to the chemicalprocess of digestion. The esophagus extends from the oropharynx to the stomach. At the top of the esophagus is the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) to prevent the influx of air intothe esophagus during respiration. At the bottom of the esophagus is the loweresophageal sphincter (LES) to prevent the reflux of acid from the stomach into theesophagus. The contents of the esophagus empty into the stomach through the cardiac sphincter. The stomach secretes gastrin, which promotes secretion of pepsinogenand hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and lipase, all of which aid digestion and mucouswhich helps protect the stomach lining. The liver is a very vascular organ located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen under the diaphragm. It has two main lobes that are comprised of smallerlobules. The liver stores a variety of vitamins and minerals. It metabolizes pro-teins; synthesizes plasma proteins, fatty acids, and triglycerides; and stores andreleases glycogen. The liver detoxifies foreign substances such as alcohol, drugs,or chemicals. The liver forms and secretes bile to aid in digestion of fat. Bile willrelease into the gall bladder for storage or into the duodenum if needed for diges-tion if the sphincter of Oddi is open due to secretion of the digestive enzymessecretin, cholecystokinin, and gastrin. The gall bladder is a small receptacle thatholds bile until it is needed. It is located on the inferior aspect of the liver. The pancreas is located retroperitoneally in the upper abdomen near the stom- ach and extends from just right of midline to the left toward the spleen. The pan-creas has both endocrine and exocrine functions. The endocrine functions includesecretion of insulin in response to elevations in blood glucose from the beta cellsof the islets of Langerhans and glucagon in response to decrease in blood glucosefrom the alpha cells. The exocrine function includes secretion of trypsin, lipase,amylase, and chymotrypsin to aid in digestion. The small intestine is comprised of the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum. The duodenum attaches to the stomach, is about one foot long and C-shaped, andcurves to the left around the pancreas. The common bile duct and pancreatic ductenter here. The jejunum is between the duodenum and ileum and is about eightfeet long. The last portion of the small intestine is the ileum which is up to twelvefeet long, depending on the size of the patient. The ileocecal valve separates theileum from the large intestine. The appendix is found at this juncture. The largeintestine can be broken down into the ascending colon, transverse colon, descend-ing colon, and sigmoid colon. The and canal.286 Demystified Just WRONG? Inflammation of the vermiform appendix (a blind pouch located near the ileocecal valve in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen) is known as appendicitis. It maybe due to obstruction from stool. The mucosal lining of the appendix continues tosecrete fluid, which will increase the pressure within the lumen of appendix, caus-ing a restriction of the blood supply to the appendix. This decrease in blood sup-ply may result in gangrene or perforation as the pressure continues to build. Painlocalizes at McBurney's point, located midway between the umbilicus and rightanterior iliac crest. Appendicitis may occur at any age, but the peak occurrence isfrom the teenage years to 30. PROGNOSIS Rupture of the appendix is more likely to occur in acute appendicitis within thefirst 36 to 48 hours. Symptoms of peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum\u2014the membrane lining the abdominal cavity) may occur as a complication of appen-dicitis. Rapid diagnosis and surgical intervention are necessary to avoid rupture ofthe appendix. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Abdominal pain begins periumbical and travels to right lower quadrant Rebound pain (pain when pressure on the abdomen is quickly removed)occurs with peritoneal inflammation Guarding (protecting the abdomen from painful exam) Rigidity of the abdomen (abdomen feels more firm when palpating) Fever due to infection Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite Right lower quadrant pain that improves with flexing the right hip suggestsperforation1287 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Elevated white blood cell count (WBC). CT scan shows enlarged appendix or fecalith. Ultrasound may show enlarged appendix. TREATMENT Surgical removal of the appendix\u2014appendectomy (may be done via laparo- scopy or open laparotomy). NPO\u2014nothing by mouth to avoid further irritation of the intestinal area, andprep for surgery. Intravenous fluids until diet resumed. Pain medications after surgery as needed; pain medication is used cautiouslypreoperatively to maintain awareness of increase in pain due to possible rup-ture of appendix. Antibiotics postoperatively if needed. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Hyperthermia Nausea NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for fever, increased heart rate, respiratory rate, and decreasein blood pressure. Assess pain level for changes. Monitor surgical site for appearance of wound, drainage. Monitor abdomen for distention, presence of bowel sounds. Monitor intake and output. Monitor bowel function.288 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Cholecystitis WHAT WENT WRONG? An inflammation of the gallbladder, often accompanied by the formation of gall- stones (cholelithiasis), is cholecystitis. The inflammation may be either acute orchronic in nature. In an acute cholecystitis, the blood flow to the gallbladder maybecome compromised which in turn will cause problems with the normal filling andemptying of the gallbladder. A stone may block the cystic duct which will result inbile becoming trapped within the gallbladder due to inflammation around the stonewithin the duct. Blood flow to the inflamed area will be minimized, localizededema develops, the gallbladder distends due to retained bile, and ischemic changeswill occur within the wall of the gallbladder. Chronic cholecystitis occurs whenthere have been recurrent episodes of blockage of the cystic duct, usually due tostones. There is chronic inflammation. The gallbladder is often contracted, whichleads to problems with storing and moving the bile. Patients may develop jaundicedue to back-up of bile or obstructive jaundice. They will exhibit a yellowish tone toskin and mucous membranes. If patients have a naturally dark pigmentation to theirskin, check palms and soles. Icterus is the yellow color change seen in the sclera(white) of the eye. There is increased risk for gallbladder inflammation and development of gall- stones with increasing age, being female or overweight, having a family history ofgallbladder disease, people on rapid weight loss diets, and during pregnancy. PROGNOSIS The ischemic changes of the gallbladder wall increase the risk of perforation of theorgan or development of gangrene. Peritonitis is a potential risk in patients if a sig-nificant area of gallbladder perforates or there is associated infection or abscessthat spreads. A small percentage of patients will develop cancer of the gallbladder.There is increased surgical risk for older patients or patients with comorbidities. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Upper abdominal, epigastric, or right upper quadrant abdominal pain whichmay radiate to right shoulder Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain increases with palpation of right upperabdomen during inspiration (Murphy's sign) causing the patient to stop tak-ing deep breaths2289 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Nausea and vomiting, especially following fatty foods Loss of appetite Fever Increased air in intestinal tract (eructation, flatulence) Pruritis (itching) of skin due to build-up of bile salts Clay-colored stools due to lack of urobilinogen in gut (normally converted from bilirubin which was blocked with bile flow) Jaundice\u2014yellowish skin and mucous membrane discoloration Icterus\u2014yellowish discoloration of sclera (white of eye) Dark, foamy urine as kidneys attempt to clear out bilirubin INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Ultrasound of gallbladder shows cholelithiasis, inflammation. HIDA scan (hepatic iminodiacetic acid) may be more sensitive than ultra-sound in showing obstructed duct. CT scan shows be elevated ifthere is obstruction. White blood cell (WBC) count elevation with Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehy-drogenase (LDH) will elevated with abnormal liver function. TREATMENT Low-fat diet. Intravenous fluid replacement for vomiting. Administer antiemetics for control of nausea and vomiting: prochlorperazine trimethobenzamide Replace fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) as needed. Administer analgesics for adequate pain control: meperidine290 Medical-Surgical Nursing (may cause spasm of sphincter of Oddi, increasing pain). Administer antibiotics for acute symptoms. Placement of stent into gallbladder if the patient is not a candidate for surgery. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of gallbladder. Surgical removal of gallbladder: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy Open cholecystectomy NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Chronic pain Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Nausea NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for changes in temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, distention, and tenderness. Assess pain level for adequate pain control. Assess postoperative wound for drainage, signs of infection. Monitor T-tube drainage in postoperative open cholecystectomy patients;empty and record at least every 8 hours. Advance diet to low-fat diet postoperatively as tolerated. Cirrhosis WHAT WENT WRONG? Injury to the cellular structure of the liver causes fibrosis due to chronic inflamma-tion and necrotic changes, resulting in cirrhosis. There are nodular changes to theliver. The bile ducts and blood vessels through the liver may become blocked dueto both the nodular changes and fibrosis. These changes to the liver cause enlarge-ment of the organ and change in texture. There is increased pressure within the3291 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System portal vein. This causes resistance to blood flow throughout the venous system in the liver and also backs up venous blood to the spleen, causing enlargement of thisorgan also. Damage to the liver may be reversible if the cause if identified early andremoved. The most common causes of cirrhosis include chronic alcohol use, liverdamage secondary to exposure to drugs or toxins, viral hepatitis (especially hepati-tis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D in those already infected with hepatitis B), fattyliver (steatohepatitis), autoimmune hepatitis, cystic fibrosis, metabolic disorders(excess iron storage\u2014hemachromatosis), or genetic causes. PROGNOSIS As cirrhosis progresses, the patient may develop encephalopathy and coma. Earlysigns and symptoms of encephalopathy include altered level of consciousness,neuromuscular changes, and elevated serum ammonia levels. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Initially asymptomatic Weakness, fatigue due to chronic disease Muscle cramps Weight loss Anorexia Nausea with possible vomiting Ascites\u2014the accumulation of fluid within the abdominal cavity due to por-tal hypertension Abdominal pain Portal hypertension Pruritus (itching) Ecchymosis (bruises) or petechiae (small, pinpoint, round, reddish purplemarks) Coagulation defects due to problems with vitamin K absorption, causingproblems with production of clotting factors Amenorrhea Impotence due to inactivity of hormones Gynecomastia Jaundice due to problems with excretion of bilirubin Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) in over one-half of patients292 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Spider veins\u2014spider angiomas or telangiectasias on cheeks, nose, shoulders or upper chest Redness of palms\u2014palmar erythema Glossitis due to vitamin deficiency Peripheral edema elevated. Fecal urobilinogen with biliary tract obstruction. Serum protein decreased. Serum albumin decreased. Anemia with elevated MCV , MCH. White blood cell (WBC) count low. Prothrombin time is prolonged due to changes in hepatic production of clot-ting factors. Platelet count low (thrombocytopenia). Ammonia level elevated as the disease advances. Abdominal x-rays show hepatomegaly. Abdominal CT scan shows hepatomegaly, ascites. Ultrasound shows hepatomegaly, ascites, portal shows varices. TREATMENT Low-sodium diet; adequate calorie intake. Restrict fluid intake if hyponatremic (low serum sodium) or fluid overloaded.293 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Restrict alcohol intake to prevent further damage. Administer vitamin supplements\u2014folate, thiamine, multivitamin. Administer diuretics remove ascitic fluid. Monitor coagulation profile (PT, PTT, INR). Administer lactulose to promote removal of ammonia in the gut. Administer antibiotics to destroy the normal GI flora which decreases pro- tein breakdown and the rate of ammonia production: neomycin sulfate metronidazole Shunt superior venacava. Portocaval\u2014diverts venous blood flow from liver to decrease portal andesophageal pressures. Transjugular intrahepatic portal systemic\u2014nonsurgical procedure per-formed placed into jugular and hepaticvein; needle threaded through sheath and pushed into portal vein throughthe liver; balloon enlarges the tract and stent maintains. Gastric lavage. Esophagogastgric balloon tamponade for control of bleeding from esophagealvarices. Administer blood products as needed for patients with bleeding esophagealvarices. Sclerotherapy for esophageal variceal bleeding. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective breathing pattern Excess fluid volume Risk for infection294 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output. Monitor vital signs. Weigh patient daily. Measure abdominal girth\u2014making sure to measure at level of umbilicus for consistency; marks are typically made at sides of abdomen to align tape meas-ure on subsequent days. Assess peripheral edema. Assess heart and lung sounds for excess fluid. Elevate head of bed 30 degrees or greater to ease breathing. Elevate feet to decrease peripheral edema. Monitor for signs of bleeding or bruising. Monitor level of consciousness, orientation, recent and remote memory, be-havior, mood, and affect. Crohn's Disease WHAT WENT WRONG? A noncontinuous inflammatory disease that can affect any point from the mouth tothe anus. The majority of cases involve the small and large intestine, often in the rightlower quadrant at the point where the terminal ileum and the ascending colon meet.Patients typically have an insidious onset of intermittent symptoms. The diseasecauses transmural inflammation, going deeper than the superficial mucosal layer ofthe tissue to affect all layers. Over time the inflammatory changes within the gas-trointestinal tract can lead to strictures or the formation of fistulas. The affectedtissue develops granulomas and takes on a mottled appearance interspersed withnormal tissue. There is a genetic predisposition and a bimodal peak of onset at 16 to21 years old. PROGNOSIS Crohn's disease is a chronic disorder with periods of exacerbation and remission.Many patients will ultimately need surgery to deal with bowel obstruction, devel-opment of strictures, or fistula formation.4295 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fever Right lower quadrant pain Diarrhea (non-bloody) Abdominal mass Weight loss (unintentional) Fatigue Bloating after meals (postprandial) Abdominal cramping due to sedimentation rate will be elevated during exacerbations. Anemia\u2014due to both vitamin B12and folic acid deficiency. Albumin level will be low. Electrolytes may be abnormal due to loss from diarrhea and malabsorption. Barium studies will show \"apple core\" in area of stricture formation, narrow-ing due to inflammation, and fistula formation. Not performed if bowel per-foration is a concern. CT scan shows abscess formation and thickening of bowel wall due to in-flammation. Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy for direct visualization of lower GI tract orfor biopsy. TREATMENT Dietary restriction. Nutritional supplementation.296 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Administer vitamin B12and folic azathioprine 6-mercaptopurine Administer methotrexate to induce or maintain remission. Administer antidiarrheal medications to decrease fluid loss; use with caution: diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate Intravenous fluids to maintain hydration. Surgical correction of intestinal obstruction, fistula, perforation. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Altered bowel elimination NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for temperature increase, pulse increase, and change in blood pressure. Monitor intake and output. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, tenderness, masses. Assess postoperative wound for signs of infection, drainage. Wound care postoperatively. Proper skin care if bowel-skin fistula: use of drainable pouch with skin wafer.297 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System cleaning skin promptly if drainage comes in contact with skin. Nutritional supplementation with Ensure \u00ae, Sustacal, Vivonex. Teach patient about home care needs. Diverticulitis Disease WHAT WENT WRONG? Small out-pouchings called diverticula develop along the intestinal tract. Diverti- culosis is the condition of having these diverticula. Any part of the large or smallintestine may be involved. The area of the intestinal tract that most commonlydevelops diverticula is the lower portion of the large intestine. Certain types ofundigested foods can become trapped in the pouches of the intestine. Bacteria mul-tiply in the area, causing further inflammation. Diverticulitis is an inflammation ofat least one of the diverticula. Diets that have a low fiber content, seeds, or nutshave been implicated in the development of diverticulitis. Perforation of the diver-ticula is possible when they are inflamed. PROGNOSIS Inflammation in diverticulitis increases the risk of perforation of the intestine.Peritonitis will develop from bacterial contamination after perforation of a diver-ticula. Bleeding from the intestinal mucosa in the area of inflammation can alsooccur. The presence of diverticula and repeated periods of inflammation may allowdevelopment of fistula formation from the diverticula to other areas within theabdomen, such as the intestine or bladder. Patients needing surgery may have acolostomy postoperatively. Depending on the location of the diverticulitis and thereason for the surgery, the colostomy may be reversible after healing has occurred. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic in diverticulosis Change in bowel habits Bloating, increased gas Abdominal pain most often in the left lower quadrant with diverticulitis Rectal bleeding due to inflammation with diverticulitis5298 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Fever with diverticulitis Nausea, vomiting Tachycardia due to fever Peritonitis if diverticula ruptures INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Barium enema will show diverticula\u2014not done if there is increased risk of perforation. Colonoscopy will show diverticula\u2014not done during acute inflammation. CT scan will show thickening of bowel wall due to inflammation or abscessin diverticulitis. Elevated white blood count (WBC) during ciprofloxacin metronidazole intravenous hydration. Manage pain as needed. NPO or clear liquids (depending on order) during acute inflammation to restintestinal tract. Surgical intervention to correct perforation of diverticula, abscess formal-tion, bowel obstruction, fistula formation. NG tube postoperatively. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Altered bowel elimination Disturbed body image299 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for fever, increased heart rate, and decreased blood pressure. Assess abdomen for distention, presence of bowel sounds. Monitor intake and output. Postoperatively check: Stoma at colostomy site Wound site for drainage or signs of infection Peripheral circulation, swelling due to increased risk of clot formation Teach patients: Eat low-residue foods during flare-ups. Eat high-fiber diet when asymptomatic, fresh fruits and vegetables, whole wheat breads, bran cereals. Avoid laxatives and enemas due to increased irritation and intra-abdominalpressure. Avoid lifting during exacerbation. Avoid eating nuts and seeds. Gastroenteritis WHAT WENT WRONG? An acute inflammation of the gastric and intestinal mucosa which is most com-monly due to bacterial, viral, protozoal, or parasitic infection. It may also be causedby irritation due to chemical or toxin exposure or allergic response. Viral exposureis more likely in winter; bacterial exposure is more common in summer whenfood-borne illness exposure is likely. PROGNOSIS Symptoms may be self-limiting or may need prescription medication to resolve theillness. Older or debilitated patients may have more severe symptoms or requirehospitalization due to dehydration.6300 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Nausea and vomiting due to gastric irritation Diarrhea\u2014watery, soft, may be mixed with mucous or blood Abdominal pain due to intestinal irritation Abdominal distention Fever due to infection Anorexia due to gastric irritation Malaise due to infection Headache due to viral illness Signs of dehydration\u2014dry, flushed skin and mucous membranes, decreased urine output, tachycardia, poor skin turgor, orthostatic blood pressure changes INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CBC may show leukocytosis or eosinophilia (parasites). Electrolytes show imbalance due to GI loss. BUN and creatinine elevated due to dehydration. Stool for ova and parasites show positive with parasitic infection. TREATMENT Monitor intake and output. Replace fluids lost. Administer antiemetic medication for symptom relief: prochlorperazine bismuth subsalicylate Need to allow organism way out of gastrointestinal system (either anti-emetic or antidiarrheal, not both).301 CHAPTER for infectious cause: ciprofloxacin metronidazole Intravenous fluids to correct dehydration. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Deficient fluid volume Altered bowel elimination Diarrhea Fatigue NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor intake and output. Replace fluids lost. Assess skin and mucous membranes for signs of dehydration. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, tenderness Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) WHAT WENT WRONG? The reflux of stomach acid and contents into the esophagus. This typically causes symptoms because the lining of the esophagus is not protected against the acid thatis normally found only in the stomach. The pain that is produced is often referred toas heartburn, or may be mistaken for cardiac pain. The pain may also be referredto the back. The pain occurs more frequently in men, people who are obese, smok-ers, and those who use alcohol or medications that lower the muscle tone of the7302 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified lower esophageal sphincter. The pain due to acid refluxing into the esophagus is worse after eating or when lying down. Patients with a hiatal hernia may alsoexperience reflux due to the increased pressure that exists from a portion of thestomach protruding upward through the diaphragm. PROGNOSIS Control of symptoms is possible through lifestyle modification and use of med-ications to reduce acid production within the stomach. There has been no correla-tion shown between the severity of patient symptoms and the degree of damagebeing done to the tissue of the esophagus. Patients with ongoing symptoms shouldhave an upper endoscopy to allow for visualization and biopsy of the area to mon-itor for the possibility of cancer of the esophagus developing due to long-termreflux. Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition of the esophagus thatoccurs due to reflux, where cellular changes have occurred and the patient needsto be monitored for progression to a malignant cell type. Some patients maydevelop trouble with swallowing due to the development of scarring from long-term exposure to acid. These patients may develop strictures over time. Procedurescan be performed to help stretch the lumen of the esophagus to aid in swallowing. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Epigastric burning, worse after eating Heartburn Burping (eructation) or flatulence Sour taste in mouth, often worse in the morning Nausea Bloating Cough due to reflux high in the esophagus Hoarseness or change in voice INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS 24-hour pH monitoring of lower esophageal area will show elevations. Barium swallow or upper GI study may show reflux.303 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Endoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows irritation from cellular changes of chronic reflux is also used to monitor patients with Barrett'sesophagus. Esophageal manometry to measure lower esophageal sphincter tone. TREATMENT Administer antacids to neutralize acid; these quickly: Gaviscon Administer H2 (histamine of acid: ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, cimetidine Administer proton acid: omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole Have patient eat six small meals rather than three large ones to reduce intra-abdominal pressure. Surgery or endoscopic procedures may be performed to prevent the refluxfrom occurring. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Risk for imbalanced nutrition: more than what body requires Acute pain Chronic pain NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Assess abdomen for distention, bowel sounds. Teach about medication management. Teach patient about lifestyle modifications: Not to lie down after eating. Elevate head of bed.304 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Avoid wearing clothing that is tight at waist. Avoid acidic foods (citrus, vinegar, tomato), peppermint, caffeine, alcohol. Stop smoking. Lose weight if overweight Gastrointestinal Bleed WHAT WENT WRONG? Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract may cause significant blood loss. The bleed- ing may be from either the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. Upper gastrointesti-nal bleeds are commonly from ulcers, esophageal varices, neoplasms, arteriovenousmalformations, Mallory-Weiss tears secondary to vomiting, or anticoagulant use.Lower gastrointestinal bleeds are commonly due to fissure formation, rectal trauma,colitis, polyps, colon cancer, diverticulitis, vasculitis, or ulcerations. PROGNOSIS The amount and speed of blood loss coupled with the patient's age and co-morbidities account for the prognosis. The greater the loss of blood, the harder itis for the system to overcome the stress. Multiple transfusions to replace the lostblood increase the patient's risk for a reaction. Patients with blood-clotting disor-ders have a greater risk of a significant bleed. Patients may go into shock if theamount of blood loss is great, as they become hemodynamically unstable. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Hematemesis\u2014vomiting of blood (red, maroon, coffee BP of at least 10 mmHg with position changes Tachycardia as body attempts to circulate lesser blood volume Pallor due to decrease in circulating blood volume Lightheadedness8305 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Diaphoresis (sweating) Nausea INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Positive fecal occult blood. Hemoglobin drops. Hematocrit drops. Anemia (iron deficiency) with chronic slow bleed. Nasogastric aspirate positive with upper GI bleed. Anoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy may show site of lower GI bleed. Arteriography may show site of bleed. Bleeding scan may show site of bleed with radioisotope-tagged RBCs. TREATMENT Maintain IV access. Administer isotonic fluids like normal saline. Monitor serial hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Type and cross match for 3 to 6 units depending on amount of blood loss. Transfuse packed RBCs, type-specific when possible (type O negative when type-specific unavailable\u2014no time to get results back from lab yet). May need to administer albumin or fresh frozen plasma, depending on amountof units transfused and comorbidities such as cirrhosis or clotting disorders. Endoscopic procedures to treat ulcer topically, with injectable or laser treatment. Esophageal varices may be treated by tamponade with Blakemore-Sengstakentube. Surgery indicated when bleeding uncontrolled. NURSING DIAGNOSES Deficient fluid volume Decreased cardiac output Anxiety306 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for changes\u2014drop in BP, increase in pulse or respiration. Monitor intake and output. Replace volume lost. Monitor abdomen for bowel sounds, tenderness, distention. Maintain large bore IV (14- to 18-gauge) access. Assess IV site for signs of redness or swelling. Monitor lab results\u2014drop in lab values may lag behind blood loss. Monitor during blood transfusion as per institution protocol for checking blood unit, patient identity, frequency of vital signs, and documentation. Gastritis WHAT WENT WRONG? Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining due to either erosion or atrophy.Erosive causes include stresses such as physical illness or medications such asnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Atrophic causes include a his-tory of prior surgery (such as gastrectomy), pernicious anemia, alcohol use, orHelicobacter pylori infection. PROGNOSIS Gastritis may cause changes within the cells of the stomach lining leading to mal-nutrition, lymphoma, or gastric cancer. Hospitalized patients, especially in criti-cal care settings, should have preventive medications to avoid the developmentof gastritis. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Nausea and vomiting Anorexia9307 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Epigastric area discomfort Epigastric tenderness on palpation due to gastric irritation Bleeding from irritation of the gastric mucosa Hematemesis\u2014possible coffee ground emesis due to partial digestion of blood Melena\u2014black, tarry stool INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Hemoglobin and hematocrit decrease. Anemia (iron deficiency) due to chronic, slow blood loss. Fecal occult blood positive. Helicobacter pylori may be positive. Upper endoscopy Administer antacids: Maalox, Mylanta, Gaviscon present. Diet modification. Monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Risk for imbalanced fluid volume Nausea308 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Monitor intake and output. Monitor stool for occult blood. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, tenderness. Teach patient about: Diet restrictions: avoid alcohol, caffeine, acidic foods. Medications. The need to avoid smoking. The need to avoid NSAIDs. Hepatitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver cells. This is most commonly due to a viral cause which may be either an acute illness or become chronic. The diseasemay also be due to exposure to drugs or toxins. Hepatitis A is transmitted via an oral route, often due to contaminated water or poor sanitation when traveling; it is also transmitted in daycare settings and resi-dential institutions. It can be prevented by vaccine. Hepatitis B is transmitted via a percutaneous route, often due to sexual contact, IV drug use, mother-to-neonate transmission or possibly blood transfusion. It canbe prevented by vaccine. Hepatitis C is transmitted via a percutaneous route, often due to IV drug use or, less commonly, sexual contact. There is currently no vaccine available. Hepatitis D is transmitted via a percutaneous route and needs hepatitis B to spread cell to cell. There is no vaccine available for hepatitis D. Hepatitis E is transmitted via an oral route and is associated with water con- tamination. There is no known chronic state of hepatitis E and no current vaccineavailable. Hepatitis G is transmitted via a percutaneous route and is associated with chronic infection but not significant liver disease. Exposure to medications (even at therapeutic doses), drugs, or chemicals can also cause hepatitis. Onset is usually within the first couple of days of use, and maybe within the first couple of doses. Hepatotoxic substances include acetamino-phen, carbon tetrachloride, benzenes, and valproic acid.10309 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System PROGNOSIS Hepatitis may occur as an acute infection (viral type A, E) or become a chronic state. The patient with chronic disease may be unaware of the illness until testingof liver function shows abnormalities and further testing reveals presence of hep-atitis. The chronic (viral type B, C) disease state creates the potential developmentof progressive liver disease. Some patients with chronic disease will need livertransplant. Recurrence rate post-transplant is high. Liver cancer may develop inthose with chronic disease states. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Acute hepatitis: Malaise Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea or constipation Low-grade fever Dark urine due to change in liver function Jaundice due to liver compromise Tenderness in right upper quadrant of abdomen Hepatomegaly Arthritis, glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa in hepatitis B Chronic hepatitis: Asymptomatic with elevated liver enzymes Symptoms as acute hepatitis Cirrhosis due to altered liver function Ascites due to decrease in liver function, increased portal hypertension Bleeding from esophageal varices Encephalopathy due to diminished liver function Bleeding due to clotting disorders Enlargement of spleen INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS AST elevated. ALT elevated.310 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified IgM anti-HA V in acute or early convalescent stage of hepatitis A. IgG anti-HA V in later convalescent stage of hepatitis A. HBeAg indicates current viral replication of hepatitis B and infectivity. HBsAg shows presence of the hepatitis B surface antigen which is indicative of either current or past infection with hepatitis B. IgM anti-HBc shows acute or recent infection with hepatitis B. IgG anti-HBc shows convalescent or past infection with hepatitis B. HBV DNA shows presence of hepatitis B DNA, most sensitive. Anti-HCV present with hepatitis C infection. HCV RNA present with hepatitis C infection. Anti-HDV present with hepatitis D infection. WBC count normal to low. Liver biopsy shows hepatocellular necrosis. Urinalysis shows protein and bilirubin. TREATMENT Avoid medications metabolized in the liver. Avoid alcohol. Remove or discontinue causative agent if drug-induced or toxic hepatitis. Intravenous hydration if vomiting during acute hepatitis. Activity as tolerated. High-calorie diet; breakfast is usually the best tolerated meal. Administer interferon or lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B. Administer interferon and ribavirin for hepatitis C. Administer prednisone in autoimmune hepatitis. Liver transplantation. NURSING DIAGNOSES Fatigue Risk for injury Impaired tissue integrity311 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, tenderness, ascites. Plan appropriate rest for patient in acute phase. Monitor intake and output. Assess mental status for changes due to encephalopathy. Assist patient to: Plan palatable meals; remember that breakfast is generally the best toler- ated meal. Avoid smoking areas\u2014intolerance to smoking. Hiatal Hernia WHAT WENT WRONG? This is also known as a diaphragmatic hernia. A part of the stomach protrudes upthrough the diaphragm near the esophagus into the chest. Patients may be asymp-tomatic or have daily symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Thehernia may be a sliding hiatal hernia which allows movement of the upper portionof the stomach including the lower esophageal sphincter up and down throughthe diaphragm. These patients typically have symptoms of GERD. Another typeof hiatal hernia is a rolling hernia in which a portion of the stomach protrudes upthrough the diaphragm, but the lower esophageal sphincter area remains below thelevel of the diaphragm. These patients do not generally suffer from reflux. PROGNOSIS Lifestyle modifications may help control the symptoms of hiatal hernia. Somepatients who do not get adequate control of symptoms or are refractory to treat-ment may need surgery to correct the movement through the diaphragm. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Sliding hernia: Heartburn Difficulty swallowing Medical-Surgical Nursing pain Rolling hernia: Chest pain Shortness of breath after eating Feeling of fullness after eating INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Barium swallow or upper GI study shows hiatal hernia. TREATMENT Administer antacids for Tums, Gaviscon ranitidine, nizatidine, famotidine, cimetidine Administer acid: omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole Avoid lying down after eating. Modify eating schedule; small, frequent meals. Elevate head of bed. Avoid clothing that is tight around the waist. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Chronic pain NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Assess abdomen for distention, bowel sounds. Teach patient about lifestyle modifications: Medication management.313 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Not to lie down after eating. Elevate head of bed. Avoid wearing clothing that is tight at waist. Avoid acidic foods (citrus, vinegar, tomato), peppermint, caffeine, alcohol. Stop smoking. Lose weight if overweight. Intestinal Obstruction and Paralytic Ileus WHAT WENT WRONG? An intestinal obstruction occurs when motility through the intestine is blocked. This may be caused by a mechanical obstruction due to the presence of a tumor,presence of adhesions from prior surgery, infection or fecal impaction. A paralyticileus results when motility through the intestine is blocked without any obstruct-ing mass. This may occur during the postoperative period following intra-abdominalsurgery, during a severe systemic illness (sepsis), electrolyte imbalance, or becauseof a metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis). PROGNOSIS Disruption of intestinal function needs to be reestablished for return to homeostasis.In most cases the underlying cause must also be corrected in order for the intestinalfunction to be restored. Nutritional needs must be met during the treatment period. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Obstruction: Abdominal pain (cramping, intermittent or constant) Abdominal distention V omiting of gastrointestinal contents (may eventually include stool as GItract backs up) Bowel sounds high-pitched on palpation12314 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Paralytic Abdominal pain (constant) Abdominal distention V omiting of gastrointestinal contents Bowel sounds diminished or absent INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Abdominal x-ray shows dilation of small bowel with air-fluid levels in ob- struction; diffuse distention in ileus. TREATMENT NPO to rest intestinal tract. Nasogastric tube attached to suction the contents from stomach. Intravenous fluid replacement with isotonic solution. Correction of electrolyte imbalances. Parenteral nutrition replacement and vitamin supplementation. Administer antiemetics if nausea continues after NG tube in place. Monitor electrolytes. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Risk for imbalanced fluid volume Altered bowel elimination NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for changes. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, tenderness. Monitor intravenous access site for irritation, redness, swelling. Keep patient NPO. Monitor intake and output. Replace fluids lost from all sources315 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Pancreatitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas which causes destructive cellular changes. It may be an acute or a chronic process. Acute pancreatitis involves auto-digestion of the pancreas by pancreatic enzymes and development of fibrosis. Bloodglucose control may be affected by the changes to the pancreas. Chronic pancreatitisresults from recurrent episodes of exacerbation, leading to fibrosis and a decrease inpancreatic function. Presence of gallstones blocking a pancreatic duct, chronic useof alcohol, post-abdominal trauma or surgery, or elevated cholesterol are associatedwith an increased risk of pancreatitis. PROGNOSIS Acute pancreatitis may be life-threatening. Pleural effusion may develop as a com-plication of acute pancreatitis; older patients have a greater risk of also developingpneumonia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is another complication thatmay occur, affecting the body's ability to clot due to depleted clotting factors inthe development of small thrombi. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Epigastric pain due to inflammation and stretching of pancreatic duct Boring abdominal pain may radiate to back or left shoulder in acute pan-creatitis Gnawing continuous abdominal pain with acute exacerbations in chronicpancreatitis Patient in knee-chest position for comfort\u2014reduces tension on abdomen Nausea and vomiting Bluish-gray discoloration of periumbilical area and abdomen (Cullen's sign) Bluish-gray discoloration of flank areas (Turner's sign) Ascites Weight loss Blood glucose elevation Fatigue13316 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Elevated serum amylase. Elevated serum lipase. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) due to inflammation. Elevated cholesterol. Elevated glucose due to labile effect on glucose control. Elevated bilirubin. CT scan shows inflammation. Chest x-ray may show pleural effusion. TREATMENT NPO during acute stage to reduce release of pancreatic enzymes. Intravenous fluids for hydration. Total parenteral nutrition. Administer vitamin supplementation. Pain management with narcotics during acute stage. Avoid morphine that may increase pain due to spasm of the sphincter of Oddi at the opening to the small intestine from the common bile connected to suction if vomiting. Surgical intervention for abscess or pseudocyst. Chronic: Blood glucose control with insulin. Administer pancreatic enzymes with meals. Surgical intervention for pain control, abscess. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires317 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System NURSING INTERVENTION Assess vital signs for elevated temperature, elevated pulse, and changes in blood pressure. Assess pain level. Monitor intake and output. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, tenderness, masses, ascites. Monitor fingerstick blood glucose. Assess lung sounds for bilateral equality. Frequent oral care for NPO patients. Teach patient about home care: Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Bland, low-fat, high-protein, high-calorie, small, frequent meals. Use of blood glucose meter. Medication management, schedule, side effects. Plan rest periods until strength returns. Peritonitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Peritonitis is an acute inflammation of the peritoneum, which is the lining of theabdominal cavity. Peritonitis may be primary or secondary to another diseaseprocess. It typically occurs due to bacterial presence within the peritoneal space.The bacteria may have passed from the gastrointestinal tract or the rupture of anorgan within the abdomen or pelvis. After the introduction of the bacteria into theabdominal area, an inflammatory reaction occurs. PROGNOSIS It is a life-threatening disease process. Patients may develop septicemia from thebacteria within the abdomen that enter the bloodstream. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fever Tachycardia14318 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Abdominal distention Abdominal pain\u2014may be localized or generalized Rebound pain (pain when quickly removing pressure during palpation of abdomen) Rigid abdomen Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite Decreased bowel sounds Decreased urine output INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Elevated white blood cell count (WBC). Blood cultures to identify organisms. Abdominal x-rays to show free air from perforation. Ultrasound to identify causative problem (appendicitis, etc.). Peritoneal lavage to analyze fluid for WBC count, bacteria, bile. CT scan to identify causative problem (appendicitis, salpingitis, etc.). TREATMENT Intravenous fluids. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical intervention may be necessary to correct cause of peritonitis. Pain management postoperatively. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Impaired tissue integrity Impaired skin integrity NURSING INTERVENTION Weigh daily. Monitor vital signs.319 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Monitor intake and output. NPO to avoid irritation of intestinal tract, further stress on abdominal organs. Position for comfort, head of bed elevated. Assess for return of bowel sounds postoperatively. Teach patient about home care: Pain management. Wound care, drains, etc. Monitor for signs of infection. Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) WHAT WENT WRONG? An ulcer develops when there is erosion of a portion of the mucosal layer of either the stomach or duodenum. The ulcer may occur within the stomach (gastriculcer), or the duodenum (duodenal ulcer). A break in the protective mucosal lin-ing allows the acid within the stomach to make contact with the epithelial tissues.Gastric ulcers favor the lesser curvature of the stomach. Duodenal ulcers tend tobe deeper, penetrating through the mucosa to the muscular layer. Helicobacter pylori infection has been associated with duodenal ulcers. Stress ulcers are asso- ciated with another acute medical condition or traumatic injury. As the bodyattempts to heal from the other physical condition (for example, major surgery),small areas of ischemia develop within the stomach or duodenum. The ischemicareas then ulcerate. PROGNOSIS The ulcerated areas may develop bleeding or may perforate. Depending on thelocation of the ulceration, a vessel may become exposed to the effects of the stom-ach acids. Damage to these vessels may result in significant bleeding. Perforationof the ulcer can occur as the ulcer continues to erode more deeply into the tissue.Perforation permits the contents of the stomach or duodenum to enter the peri-toneum, leading to peritonitis, paralytic ileus, septicemia, and shock. This patientwill need emergency surgery due to a life-threatening condition.15320 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Epigastric area pain: Worse just after eating as acid increases with gastric ulcer Worse when stomach is empty (with duodenal ulcer); may awaken during the night due to pain Weight changes Loss with gastric ulcer Gain with duodenal ulcer Bleeding from ulcer causes: (partially duodenal ulcer Perforation of causes: Sudden, sharp pain Tender, rigid, board-like abdomen Knee-chest position reduces pain Hypovolemic shock INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Anemia due to bleeding. Stool for occult blood positive due to bleeding. H. pylori testing positive. Upper GI or barium swallow shows areas of ulceration\u2014not done if perfo-ration suspected. Upper endoscopy shows ulcer. Abdominal x-rays show free air in perforation. TREATMENT Administer antacids321 CHAPTER 7 misoprostol Adjust diet. Treat H. pylori infection if present with combination therapy: Proton pump inhibitor clarithromycin subsalicylate plus metronidazole tetracycline. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Risk for imbalanced nutrition: more than what body requires NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Monitor intake and output. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, tenderness, rigidity, rebound pain, guarding. Monitor stool for change in color, consistency, blood. Teach patient about home care: Diet modification to avoid acidic foods, caffeine, peppermint, alcohol. Eat more frequent, small meals. Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Stop smoking.322 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Ulcerative Colitis WHAT WENT WRONG? An inflammatory disease of the large intestine that affects the mucosal layer begin- ning in the rectum and colon and spreading into the adjacent tissue. There are ulcer-ations in the mucosal layer of the intestinal wall, and inflammation and abscessformation occur. Bloody diarrhea with mucous is the primary symptom. There areperiods of exacerbations and remissions. Symptom severity may vary from mild tosevere. The exact cause is unknown, but there is increased incidence in people withnorthern European, North American, or Ashkenazi Jewish origins. The peak inci-dences are from mid-teen to mid-twenties and again from mid-fifties to mid-sixties. PROGNOSIS Patients with ulcerative colitis may have an increase in symptoms with each flare-up of the disease. Malabsorption of nutrients can cause weight loss and healthproblems. Some patients will need surgery to resect the affected area of the largeintestine, resulting in a colostomy, ileal reservoir, ileoanal anastomosis, or ileoanalreservoir. There is an increased risk of colon cancer in patients with ulcerative coli-tis. The patient is also at risk for developing toxic megacolon or perforating thearea of ulceration. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Weight loss Abdominal pain Chronic bloody diarrhea with pus due to ulceration Electrolyte imbalance due to diarrhea Tenesmus\u2014spasms involving the anal sphincter; persistent desire to emptybowel INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Anemia\u2014low hemoglobin and hematocrit due to blood loss and chronicdisease.16323 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate due to inflammation. Electrolyte disturbance due to diarrhea and poor absorbance of nutrients. Double-contrast barium enema shows areas of ulceration and inflammation. Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy show ulcerations and bleeding. TREATMENT Keep stool diary to identify irritating Low-fiber, high-protein, high-calorie diet. Administer antidiarrheal medications: loperamide diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine Administer salicylate medications within the intes- for rest reduce abdominal cramping and discomfort: dicyclomine Surgical resection of affected area of large intestine. NURSING DIAGNOSES Acute pain Diarrhea Impaired skin integrity Disturbed body image324 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output. Monitor stool output, frequency. Weigh patient regularly. Sitz bath. Vitamin A & D ointment or barrier cream applied to skin. Witch hazel to soothe sensitive skin. Monitor for toxic megacolon (distended and tender abdomen, fever, elevated WBC, elevated pulse, distended colon). Teach home care for new ostomy patients or refer to enterostomal therapistfor education: Teach proper skin care of perianal area to avoid skin breakdown. Avoid fragranced products which can be irritating. Teach dietary modification, and which foods to avoid. Teach medication use, schedule, and side effects. Teach importance of follow-up care. Teach wound care for postoperative patients. Crucial Diagnostic Tests Gastroscopy This test is used to diagnose peptic, gastric, or duodenal ulcers and to obtain biopsies and specimens for H. pylori bacteria. An informed consent is obtained prior to any anesthesia. An endoscope is passed through the mouth to allow visual-ization of the pharynx, esophagus, lower esophageal sphincter, stomach, pyloricsphincter, and duodenum. Biopsies can be obtained at this time. Bleeding, ulcers, lesions, and polyps can be visually assessed. The back of the throat will be anesthe-tized to allow passage of the endoscope. Before the test\u2014The patient will be NPO. After the test\u2014Monitor vital signs. Assess for return of gag reflex. The patient remains NPO until the gag reflex returns.325 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Colonoscopy This test is used to diagnose obstruction, bleeding, change in bowel habits, and colon cancer, among other conditions. An informed consent is obtained before thepatient is given any type of anesthesia. A colonoscope is passed through the rec-tum to descending colon, hepatic flexure, and the ileo-cecal valve. The colon maybe insufflated to aid in visualization of the structures. Biopsies are obtained asindicated. The scope is withdrawn and anesthesia is reversed. The patient mayexperience abdominal distention. Risks include perforation of the large intestine.The test is commonly performed as an outpatient procedure. Before the test\u2014A thorough colon prep is necessary to ensure complete emp- tying of the bowel prior to the procedure. The patient is NPO for several hoursprior to the test due to the use of an anesthetic agent. After the test\u2014Assess the abdomen for bowel sounds and tenderness. Monitor vital signs. Assess the patient for side effects of anesthesia. Abdominal Ultrasound This is a noninvasive test and is usually painless. A transducer is guided over theabdomen, which produces sound waves that bounce off internal structures and pro-duce a picture of internal organs and structures. Before the test\u2014The patient will need to be NPO. After the test\u2014No special care is needed. Abdominal X-rays These are plain x-rays, usually flat-plate and upright, of the abdomen, to look for obstruction, foreign bodies, gas patterns, tumors, and other abnormalities. Before and after the test\u2014No special care is needed. Liver Biopsy Here, a small sample of tissue is removed from the liver and examined under amicroscope, allowing for a definite diagnosis. A thin cutting needle, through theskin of the abdomen, is used to obtain the sample. Needle biopsies are relatively326 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified simple procedures requiring only local anesthesia. Risks include bruising, bleed- ing, and infection. Before the test\u2014Informed consent will be needed. After the test\u2014Monitor vital signs for drop in blood pressure as well as an increase in pulse or respiration. Check the site for bruising or bleeding. Check skin for pallor or sweating. Computerized Tomography (CT) Scan This test uses x-rays to produce cross-sectional images of the body in two-dimensional slices. Split-second computer processing creates these images as aseries of very thin x-ray beams pass through the body. A dye (contrast medium)may be injected into a vein. Before the test\u2014The clearer images produced with the dye make it easier to distinguish a tumor from normal tissue. A CT scan uses more radiation than doconventional x-rays, but the benefits of the test outweigh the risks. Before the test\u2014Ask the patient about any history of allergy to contrast dye or shellfish. The patient may need to be NPO, depending on the area that needs to beimaged. After the test\u2014No special care is needed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Unlike an x-ray, an MRI creates images using a magnetic field and radio waves.A contrast dye also may be used. The test can take from 15 minutes to an hour. Thepatient is placed in a cylindrical tube for the test. Loud banging noises are typical. Before the test\u2014Ask the patient about any implanted hardware such as pace- makers, or history of claustrophobia. The patient may need to be NPO, dependingon the area that needs to be imaged. After the test\u2014No special care is needed. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatiography (ERCP) Here, a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) is passed through the pharynx, the stomach, and into the upper part of the small intestine. Air is used to inflate the intestinal327 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System tract to enable the openings of the pancreatic and bile ducts to be seen. A dye is injected into the ducts through a catheter via the endoscope. X-rays are taken ofthe ducts. The patient may report abdominal distention from the insufflation, anda sore throat. Before the test\u2014The patient is NPO. After the test\u2014Monitor vital signs. Assess for return of gag reflex. The patient remains NPO until gag reflex returns. Liver Function Tests These comprise several tests, obtained through a venipuncture, which show hepatic function. Transaminase (ALT) An enzyme found mainly in liver cells, ALT helps the body metabolize protein.When the liver is damaged, ALT is released in the bloodstream. Aspartate Transaminase (AST) The enzyme AST plays a role in the metabolism of alanine, an amino acid. Anincrease in AST levels may indicate liver damage or disease. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) ALP is an enzyme found in high concentrations in the liver and bile ducts, as wellas some other tissues. Higher-than-normal levels of ALP may indicate liver dam-age or disease. Albumin and Total Protein Levels of albumin\u2014a protein made by the liver\u2014and total protein show how wellthe liver is making proteins that the body needs to fight infections and performother functions. Lower-than-normal levels may indicate liver damage or disease.328 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Bilirubin Bilirubin is a red-yellow pigment that results from the breakdown of red blood cells. Normally, bilirubin passes through the liver and is excreted in stool. Elevatedlevels of bilirubin (jaundice) may indicate liver damage or disease. Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) This test measures the amount of the enzyme GGT in the blood. Higher-than-normallevels may injury. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) LDH is an enzyme found in many body tissues, including the liver. Elevated levelsof LDH may indicate liver damage. Prothrombin Time (PT) This test measures the clotting time of plasma. Increased PT may indicate liverdamage. Hepatitis Panel Tests for acute viral hepatitis include: Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) Hepatitis A Virus antibody (anti-HA V) Hepatitis B core antibody Immunoglobulin M (IgM anti-HBc) Hepatitis C Virus antibody (anti-HCV) Tests for chronic hepatitis include: Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) Hepatitis C Virus antibody (anti-HCV) Hepatitis D Virus antibody (anti-HDV) HA V is confirmed by detecting an IgM antibody to HA V (IgM anti-HA V). HBV is confirmed by detecting HBsAg and IgM anti-HBC (when HepatitisB early Antigen (HBeAg) is detected, patient is highly infectious). HCV is confirmed by detecting ELISA-2 and RIBA-2. HDV is confirmed by markers for HBV . HEV\u2014only research-based tests this time.329 CHAPTER 7 Gastrointestinal System Helicobacter Pylori This is a gram negative bacteria which can be detected by a serum test, discovered by gastric biopsy and ELISA for anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G. A carbon isotope urea breath test can reveal the presence of H. pylori (which has a false- negative rate of 5 to 15 percent). Quiz 1. An inflammatory bowel disorder in which the patient develops abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, tenesmus and weight loss is (a) Crohn's disease.(b) diverticulitis.(c) ulcerative colitis.(d) appendicitis. 2. Chronic hepatitis (a) sulfasalazine.(b) interferon and ribavirin.(c) metronidazole or ciprofloxacin.(d) acetaminophen. 3. The patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease should be taught: (a) to avoid coffee, tea, or other caffeine-containing beverages.

The glands release hormones which are chemical messengers, substances whichcontrol and regulate the activity of target cells and organs. Together, these hormonesinfluence growth, development, digestion, and regulate metabolism and reproduc-tion. The glands generally release the hormones into the blood due to a stimulus,another hormone, or a threshhold. The signal to turn off the hormone production isKey Terms Acromegaly AldosteroneAntidiuretic hormone (Syndrome X/Dysmetabolic syndrome) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 11 12 13 14 15 16Learning Objectives333 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System regulated by a process called direct feedback. Direct feedback is necessary to main- tain homeostasis. The body receives feedback about changes in hormone levels andimpacts organs or body systems to adjust the hormone production to tell the body toreturn to homeostasis. When the concentration of the substance reaches a threshhold,the gland and its production are turned off. The glands, the hormones they produce,and the effects are stated below. The thyroid gland is located in the anterior neck, overlying the trachea. makes three hormones: thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and calcitonin, which affects the blood calcium and phosphate release from the bones. Thyroid hormones affect metabolism, muscles, the heart, and many other body or gans and systems. They help regulate carbohydrate metabolism, lipids, proteins, and growth and development. Anterior pituitary glands are controlled by hormones from thehypothyroid and by direct feedback. The adrenal glands are bilateral glands that cap each kidney. They are located in the retro peritoneum. The glands are comprised of two parts: the cortex and the aderenal medulla. The cortex secretes (1) aldosterone,which is responsible for renal reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium;(2) cortisol, which maintains glucose control, increases hepatic gluconeogenesis (themaking of glucose), and manages the body's stress response; and (3) androgens, which are sex hormones. T he adrenal medulla produces, stores, and secretes epi- nephrine and norepinephrine, which are called catecholamines. When they are released, heart and respiratory rate incr ease, blood pressure rises, airways dilate, and an increase in the metabolic rate is seen. The parathyroid glands are composed of usually four, sometimes six or more, small glands which are found on the posterior side of the thyroid gland. Their func-tion is to produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH, also called parathormone,maintains the calcium level in the blood. It also regulates the phosphorus levelin the body. If the serum calcium level falls, PTH is released, which causes bonesto break down, releasing calcium into the blood. It also causes the kidneys todecrease the calcium released in the urine, and increases phosphate excretion. Just the Facts Hypothyroidism (Myxedema) WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypothyroidism is a lack of, or too little, thyroid hormone commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a chronic disorder caused by1334 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified abnormal antibodies that attack the thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism can also be caused by decreased production of the TSH hormone from the pituitary gland, aside effect of surgery, inflammation of the thyroid gland, and treatment for hyper-thyroidism. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is excellent with replacement of thyroid hormones. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fatigue due to slow metabolism Hypothermia due to slow metabolism Brittle nails due to low levels of thyroid hormone, which helps growth anddevelopment Thick dry hair from lack of thyroid hormone Dry skin from lack of thyroid hormone Menstruation changes due to diminished levels of thyroid hormone Slow cognitive function due to slow metabolism Weight gain, low levels of thyroid hormone causes fatigue, sluggishness INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased thyroid stimulating hormore (TSH) unless the cause is due to adecreased production of TSH by the pituitary Replacement hormone; levothyroxine the treatment of choice.335 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System Serum measurements of T3 and T4 will need to be performed after 6 to 8 weeks to determine if the patient is taking the correct dose. The patient needs to be aware that this is a lifetime replacement. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for imbalanced nutrition: more than what body requires Hypothermia related to decreased metabolic rate Risk for constipation related to decreased motility of the GI tract NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Provide a warm environment. Low-calorie diet. Increase fluids and fiber to prevent constipation. Take thyroid replacement hormone each morning to avoid insomnia. Monitor for signs of thyrotoxcosis (an increase in T3): nausea, vomiting,diarrhea, sweating, tachycardia. Explain to the patient: Side effects of thyroid hormone replacement. Review the signs of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Have patient contact health care provider if signs change. Hyperthyroidism (Graves' Disease) WHAT WENT WRONG? There is an overproduction of T3 and T4 by the thyroid gland that can be caused byan autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the thyroid gland.Other causes can be a benign tumor (adenomas) resulting in an enlarged thyroidgland (goiter) or an overproduction of TSH by the caused by a pitu-itary tumor.2336 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS The prognosis is good if the cause of hyperthyroidism is treated; however, hyper- thyroidism is a chronic disease. Signs such as bulging eyes (exophthalmos) are notreversible. Furthermore, thyroid surgery may result in complications. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) caused by tumor Protrusion of the eyeballs (exophthalmos) due to lymphocytic infiltrationwhich pushes out the eyeball Sweating (diaphoresis); excess thyroid hormone raises the metabolic rate Increased appetite due to increased metabolism Nervousness due to high levels of thyroid hormone Weight loss due to increased metabolism Menstrual changes due to elevated levels of thyroid hormone INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased serum T3. Increased serum T4. Increased TRH and TSH if pituitary gland is the cause of hyperthyroidism. Presence of antibodies if cause is Graves' disease. Thyroid scan reveals enlarged thyroid. TREATMENT For mild cases and for young patients, administer antithyroid medicationsuch as propylthiouracil and methimazole to block synthesis of T3 and T4. For Graves' disease and for patients 50 years of age or older, radioactiveiodine therapy is used to decrease production of thyroid hormones. Admin-ister Lugol's solution, SSKI, or potassium iodide. For severe cases where the size of the thyroid gland interferes with swallow-ing or breathing, the thyroid gland is surgically reduced in size or removed.337 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System Administer beta blockers such as propranolol until hyperthyroidism dimin- ishes to decrease sympathetic activity and control tachycardia, tremors, andanxiety. NURSING DIAGNOSES Imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires related to inadequate intakein relation to metabolic needs Fatigue related to sleep deprivation Hyperthermia related to increased metabolic rate NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Provide cool environment. Protect the patient's eyes with dark glasses and artificial tears if the patienthas exophthalmos. Provide a diet high in carbohydrates, protein, calories, vitamins, andminerals. Monitor for laryngeal edema following surgery (hoarseness or inability toclearly speak). Keep oxygen, suction, and a tracheotomy set near bed in case the neck swellsand breathing is impaired. Keep calcium gluconate near the patient's bed following surgery. This is thetreatment for tetany and is used to maintain the serum calcium level in nor-mal range. Place the patient in a semi-Fowler's position to decrease tension on the neckfollowing surgery. Support the patient's head and neck with pillows. Monitor for muscle spasms and tremors (tetany) caused by manipulation ofthe parathyroid glands during surgery. Check drainage and hemorrhage from incision line; red flags are frank hemor-rhage and purulent, foul smelling drainage. Monitor for signs of hypocalcemia (tingling of hands and fingers).338 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Check for Trousseau's sign (inflate blood pressure cuff on the arm and mus- cles contract). Check for Chvostek's sign (tapping of the facial nerve causes twitching ofthe facial muscles). Both this sign and T rousseau's sign are positive when the parathyroid glands have been manipulated during thyroid surgery, in whichcase they secrete too much phosphorus and not enough calcium. Since mus-cles, i.e. the heart, need calcium for work, a low calcium level may cause muscle spasms which are easily detected by Chvostek's sign and Trousseau'ssign. The treatment is IV calcium, administered quickly. Simple Goiter WHAT WENT WRONG? A lack of iodine in the patient's diet (endemic, simple goiter) causes the thyroidgland to become enlarged. This is seen less today because iodine is added totable salt. The thyroid gland can also become enlarged by ingesting large amountsof goitrogenic drugs or goitrogenic foods that decrease production of thyroxine,such as strawberries, cabbage, peanuts, peas, peaches, and spinach. This resultsin sporadic simple goiter. A simple goiter is not caused by inflammation orneoplasm. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is good if treated and patients go on to live normal lives. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) due to a large thyroid pressing on theesophagus Enlarged thyroid gland Respiratory distress from the large gland, causing pressure on the trachea A tight feeling in the throat from a large gland Coughing3339 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Decreased or normal serum T4 level caused by an underactive thyroid. Increased serum TSH, by the pituitary gland, attempting to stimulate or shut off production of the thyroid in making thyroid hormone. RAIU uptake normal or increased\u2014a radioactive isotope is injected into avein. A scan of the thyroid is done to visualize the thyroid more completely. Ultrasound enables sound waves to bounce off the gland, giving the size andlocation of any nodules. TREATMENT If increased TSH, administer hormone replacement with levothyroxine (T4), dessicated thyroid, or liothyronine (T3). If the thyroid gland is overactive, then administer small doses of Lugol'ssolution or potassium iodide solution. If the simple goiter cannot be reduced through medication, then a thyroid-ectomy is performed during which all or part of the thyroid is removed. NURSING DIAGNOSES Imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires; related to inadequate in-take in relation to metabolic needs Fatigue related to sleep deprivation Hyperthermia related to increased metabolic rate NURSING INTERVENTION Avoid goitrogenic foods or drugs in sporadic goiter since they make thyroidhormone production. Use iodized salt to prevent and treat endemic goiter, since the thyroid needsiodine to make thyroid hormone. Explain to patient: The need for life-long thyroid replacement after thyroidectomy and radio-active iodine.340 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified The need for intermittent lab work to monitor the thyroid. Visits to the primary care practitioner to monitor size of thyroid gland. Hypopituitarism WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypopituitarism results when the pituitary gland is unable to secrete a normal amount of pituitary hormones. Primary causes are pituitary tumors, inadequate bloodsupply to the pituitary gland, infection, radiation therapy, or surgical removal of aportion of the pituitary gland. Secondary causes affect the hypothalamus, whichregulates the pituitary gland. PROGNOSIS Patients require life-long treatment and can expect a normal life span. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fatigue caused by a decreased production of ACTH Lethargy and diminished cognition caused by a decreased production ofTSH Sensitivity to cold due to low TSH, which stimulates thyroid hormone Decreased appetite due to TSH deficiency Infertility due to luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH) production Short stature due to diminished secretion of growth hormone Infertility, amenorrhea caused by decreased production of FSH and LH INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Decreased ACTH usually due to a lesion of the pituitary. TSH deficiency due to a mass, trauma, surgery, or idiopathic.4341 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System Decreased prolactin due to a mass, causing diminished or lack of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Presence of a pituitary tumor shown on MRI. TREATMENT Administer replacement hormones (estrogen, testosterone, corticosteroids,growth hormone, and thyroid hormone). Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor if it exists. NURSING DIAGNOSES Disturbed body image related to illness Sexual dysfunction related to disease NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor weight daily because antidiuertic hormone (ADH) and adreno-cortiocotropic hormone (ACTH), from the pituitary, regulate fluid retentionand excretion in the body. Monitor intake and output to ensure the balance is equal due to hormoneregulation. Explain to the patient: The need to take medication for the rest of the patient's life. The need for frequent laboratory tests. Hyperpituitarism (Acromegaly and Gigantism) WHAT WENT WRONG? The pituitary gland produces an excessive amount of growth hormone. If hyper- pituitarism occurs before epiphyseal closure, the patient (infants and children) has gigantism, resulting in an overgrowth of all body tissues. If hyperpituitarism5342 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified occurs after epiphyseal closure, which is rare, the patient has acromegaly resulting in bone thickening, growth in width (transverse growth), and enlarged organs (visceromegaly). PROGNOSIS Successful treatment can stop progression of the disease; however, physical changesthat occur before treatment begins are permanent. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Increased body size caused by overproduction of growth hormone INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased serum growth hormone as the pituitary gland is producing an excessof growth hormone. Increased prolactin; most pituitary tumors will cause on overproduction ofone or more of the pituitary hormones. Increased glucose; diabetes is common in acromegaly. TREATMENT Administer dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine and cabergoline todecrease the tumor size. Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor. NURSING DIAGNOSES Disturbed body image related to illness or illness treatment NURSING INTERVENTIONS Perform range of motion exercise to assure joint mobility. Provide emotional support.343 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System Educate the patient: Don't stop taking hormone replacement suddenly. Hyperprolactinemia WHAT WENT WRONG There is an overproduction of the prolactin hormone that promotes lactation. Excessive secretion is usually caused by a pituitary tumor (prolactioma) but mayalso be due to hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, and medications that affectthe pituitary gland. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is very good once a diagnosis is made and treatment of the underlyingcause is started. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS The primary symptom is decreased fertility. In females, symptoms may include decreased or absent menstruation, head-ache, mood changes and galactorrhea, from hormone imbalance. Males may experience erectile dysfunction, diminished libido, gynecomastia,headache and mood changes from too much hormone. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased serum TSH as hypothyroidism can be a contributing factor to hyper-prolactimenia. Increased creatinine/BUN as renal failure can be a contributing factor. Serum human chorionic gonadotropin test for pregnancy (beta hGC) as preg-nancy can cause hyperprolactinemia. Serum AST, ALT, and bilirubin will be increased as in hypogonadism. Pituitary tumor present in MRI. TREATMENT Administer dopamine agonists: bromocriptine cabergoline to shrink pituitary tumor and return prolactin to normal levels Discontinue medications that may be causing the pituitary glands to over-produce inhibitors verapamil Radiation therapy to reduce the pituitary tumor. Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor. NURSING DIAGNOSES Disturbed body image related to illness or illness treatment Sexual dysfunction related to disease (related to loss of libido, infertility,impotence) NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor serum hormone levels to assure that medication is improving thepatient's condition.345 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System Diabetes Insipidus WHAT WENT WRONG? Either a decrease in the production of an antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the hypo- thalamus or an increase in the production of ADH by the pituitary compromises the ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine. This results in the excretion of largeamounts of diluted urine. The patient then drinks large amounts of fluid to replacethe increased urine output. PROGNOSIS Treatment will eliminate the symptoms of diabetes insipidus and the patient canexpect a normal life span. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Increased urination as the kidneys fail to concentrate urine Increased thirst as the body attempts to replace lost fluid INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Normal blood glucose indicating that diabetes insipidus isn't a complicationof diabetes mellitus. Low specific gravity in urine due to increased fluid in the urine. Increased BUN, indicating dehydration because the concentration of solutesto fluid is rising. Electrolytes indicate dehydration; Na and Cl will rise as the concentrationincreases. Vasopressin challenge test. Those patients with diabetes insipidus will notea decrease in output and thirst. If urine output decreases and urine specific gravity increases, then the prob-lem is with the pituitary gland and kidneys are normal. If urine output remains unchanged and urine specific gravity remains low,then the pituitary gland is normal and the kidneys are the problem. Presence of a pituitary tumor or hypothalamus tumor appear on an MRI.7346 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Administer replacement ADH hormone such as desmopressin to return nor- mal urination. Administer a diuretic such as hyrdrochlorothiazide to decrease urination. Place the patient on a low-salt diet to reduce urine production in the kidneys. Increase fluid intake until urination returns to normal. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for impaired urinary elimination Impaired oral mucous membrane related to inadequate oral secretions Deficient fluid volume related to excessive fluid loss or inadequate fluid intake NURSING INTERVENTION Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Monitor intake and output. Weigh the patient each day using the same scale, at the same time of day,wearing similar clothing. Explain to the patient: Medication must be taken every day. Wear a medical alert necklace/bracelet to alert health care providers thatyou have diabetes insipidus. Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti- diuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) WHAT WENT WRONG? SIADH is caused by too much ADH being secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. ADH is responsible for controlling the amount of water reabsorbed by thekidney; it prevents the loss of too much fluid. When too much water is detected,ADH production or secretion is halted. SIADH may be caused by damage to the8347 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System hypothalamus or pituitary, inflammation of the brain, some medications such as selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs), carbamazapine, cyclophosphamides, and chlorpropamide. Certain cancers, especially lung, may produce ADH. PROGNOSIS If sodium (Na) levels are kept within normal limits, prognosis is excellent. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Headaches due to hyponatremia Nausea and vomiting due to hyponatremia Confusion due to hyponatremia Personality changes due to hyponatremia INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Hyponatremia (low serum sodium) due to the dilution. TREATMENT Administer saline IV to replenish sodium. Treat underlying cause. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for imbalanced fluid volume Excess fluid volume NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor electrolytes to determine sodium levels. Restrict fluid because excess fluid dilutes sodium levels.348 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Weigh the patient daily using the same scale, at same time of day with similar clothing. Monitor intake and output. Addison's Disease WHAT WENT WRONG? Addison's disease is inadequate secretion of corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex,resulting from damage to the adrenal cortex. Autoimmune destruction of the adrenalgland and tuberculosis are two common causes of Addison's disease. A patient canexperience Addisonian crisis when infection, surgery, or other stressful events resultsin a decrease in the production of cortisol and aldosterone. Addisonian crisis is amedical emergency. PROGNOSIS With ongoing treatment, patients can expect a normal life span. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Weakness due to insufficient cortisol Weight loss due to insufficient cortisol Orthostatic hypotension due to poor fluid status from aldosterone deficiency Bronzing of the skin due to hyperpigmentation from the autoimmune disease INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased BUN due to dehydration. Increased serum potassium from changes in aldosterone secretion. Decreased secreted from decreased corticosteroids. Positive 24-hour urine aldosterone level due to less aldosterone being secreted.9349 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System Positive ACTH cortex late adrenal hormone secretion. An infusion of ACTH is given and the test ispositive if the infusion fails to raise the cortisol level. Abnormal adrenal glands appear on CT scan. TREATMENT Administer cortisone or hydrocortisone to replace cortisol. Administer fludrocortisone to regulate sodium and potassium balance. Maintain fluid balance. NURSING DIAGNOSES Fatigue related to disease state Risk for deficient fluid volume Disturbed body image related to disease state NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor fluids and electrolytes. Weigh the patient daily. Suggest bone density test for osteoporosis due to decrease in mineralo-corticoids. Explain to the patient: Medication must be taken every day. Wear a medical alert bracelet. Keep an emergency supply of medication available. Cushing's Syndrome WHAT WENT WRONG? The adrenal cortex secretes an of glucocorticoids or the pituitary gland anexcess of ACTH as a result of either tumor, adrenal tumor, or from on-going glucocorticoid therapy.10350 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Patients can expect a normal life span once the tumor is removed; however, tumors may recur. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Moon face during excess cortisol production Buffalo hump (fat pad located in the upper back) from excessive cortico-steroids Osteoporosis from an excess of corticosteroids, which weaken the bones Absence of menstruation (amenorrhea) from the effects of excess steroids Changes in mental status from excessive steroids INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Dexamethasone suppression test: A dose of glucocorticoid is given to test thehypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. If there is suppression with the dose, itindicates a pituitary origin of the excess cortisol. If no suppression occurs,the etiology is an adrenal or ectopic tumor. Increased cortisol in 24-hour urine collection from excess production. Presence of a pituitary tumor or adrenal tumor on a CT; the tumor will showon a CT scan. Increased blood glucose due to overproduction of steroids. Increased sodium due to excess fluid loss. Decreased potassium. TREATMENT Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor or adrenal tumor. NURSING DIAGNOSES Disturbed body image related to illness Excess fluid volume related to excess water and sodium reabsorption Risk for infection related to immunosuppression and inadequate primarydefenses351 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System NURSING INTERVENTION Daily weighing to monitor fluid status. Monitor input and output to ensure adequate hydration. Monitor for glucose and acetone in urine as elevated levels of corticosteroids may produce hyperglycemia. Allow for adequate rest to allow the body to stabilize. Avoid trauma to the skin because elevated levels of corticosteroids can delaywound healing. Bone densitometry to assess for osteoporosis as corticosteroids can leechcalcium from the bone. Following surgery: Assist in early ambulation, deep breathing, coughing to facilitate mucousmobilization and decrease risk for emboli. Monitor incision site for drainage, erythema, and signs of infection. Explain to patient: Maintain a high-calorie, high-calcium diet to aid in wound repair andreplace calcium. Administer pain medication as needed. Primary Aldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome) WHAT WENT WRONG? The adrenal cortex is secreting an excessive amount of caused by an adrenal tumor, a malfunctioning adrenal cortex, or sources outside the adrenalgland producing aldosterone. Some medications, such as calcium channel block-ers, can lower aldosterone levels which can confuse the diagnosis. PROGNOSIS The patient can expect a normal life span, if diagnosed and treated early.11352 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Increased blood pressure caused by the excess aldosterone Headache caused by increased blood pressure Muscle weakness from decreased serum potassium Increased thirst (polydispsia) due to high levels of aldosterone Increased urination (poluria) due to high levels of aldosterone INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Decreased serum potassium. 24-hour urine collection to monitor aldosterone, creatinine, and cortisol levels. Increased urinary aldosterone. Presence of an adrenal tumor on a CT scan. TREATMENT Administer diuretics to control hypertension and raise potassium levels: spironolactone Administer medications to block the affect of aldosterone: eplerenone Surgically remove the adrenal tumor if present. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for imbalanced fluid volume Risk for activity intolerance Impaired physical mobility NURSING INTERVENTION Restrict sodium intake. Monitor intake and output.353 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System Weigh the patient daily. Explain to patient: Thirst, dry mucous membranes are caused by low sodium. Allow sips of water, ice chips. Pheochromocytoma WHAT WENT WRONG? A tumor on the adrenal medulla secretes excessive amounts of epinephrine andnorepinephrine. PROGNOSIS Patients who are diagnosed and treated early can expect a normal life withclose follow-up, if the tumor is benign. Patients can expect a limited prognosis if the tumor is malignant. Metastasis may develop at any time. The patient's hyper-tension often resolves with removal of the tumor, but may recur later in life. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Uncontrollable hypertension as a result from increased epinephrine and nor-epinephrine Headaches as a result of hypertension Palpitations and tachycardia due to increased production of catecholamines Dilated pupils from increased production of epinephrine and norepinephrine INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Presences of catecholamines Increased catecholamines, metanephrines, and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)in tumor shown in CT scan.12354 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Surgical removal of the adrenal tumor. Administer antihypertensive medication to help lower blood pressure. Administer beta blockers to diminish effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine: nifedipine nicardipine propranolol NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for delayed surgical recovery Ineffective tissue perfusion (cardiac) Anxiety NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor blood pressure. Administer medication to control hypertension. Monitor urine for catecholamines. Decrease stress. Explain to patient: Quit smoking to help lower blood pressure. Reduce caffeine to help lower blood pressure. Hypoparathyroidism WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypoparathyroidism is diminished functioning of the parathyroid glands leading to low levels of PTH, which causes hypocalcemia. The primary cause of13355 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System hypoparathy roidism is destruction of the glands by an autoimmune cause. Para- thyroidectomy is no longer a major cause, since surgery now only removes the gland that is malfunctioning. Occasionally the gland(s) may be accidentally removed during thyroidectomy. PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on the promptness with which a diagnosis is made and treat-ment started. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Tetany (muscle irritability) due to abnormal levels of calcium Tingling of periorbital area, hands, and feet from abnormal calcium levels Lethargy due to low levels of parathyroid hormone Cataract development Convulsions due to acute low calcium levels INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Decreased serum calcium due to low levels of PTH. Increased serum phosphate due to low levels of PTH. Decreased serum PTH from diminished secretion from the parathyroidglands. Decreased urinary calcium from diminished PTH. Positive Chvostek's sign due to decreased calcium levels. Positive Trousseau's sign due to decreased calcium levels. TREATMENT Initiate seizure precaution. Administer calcium gluconate by slow IV drip for acute hypocalcemia.356 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Oral calcium\u2014calcium gluconate, lactate, carbonate (Os-Cal). Large doses of vitamin D (calciferol) to help absorption of calcium. Aluminum hydroxide gel (Amphogel) or aluminum carbonate gel; basic (Basaljel) to decrease phosphate levels. Keep tracheostomy set and injectable calcium gluconate at bedside for im-paired respiration from swelling as well as for emergency administration of calcium. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Ineffective health maintenance Impaired urinary elimination NURSING INTERVENTION If the parathyroids were damaged during thyroid surgery: Administer calcium to maintain the serum levels in a low normal range. Testing should be done every 3 months. Hyperparathyroidism WHAT WENT WRONG? Overactivity of the parathyroid glands caused by a tumor produces too much PTH,resulting in hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Excess calcium is reabsorbed bythe kidneys and may result in kidney stones; however, malfunction in the feedbackmechanism prevents detection of excessive calcium levels in the blood, thereby fail-ing to adjust the secretion of PTH. Parathyroid tumors are usually benign. PROGNOSIS Patients can expect a normal life span once the parathyroid tumor is removed.14357 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic Increased serum calcium level Bone pain or fracture as a result of excreting calcium from bone Kidney stones Frequent urination as a result of increased calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria) INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased serum calcium. Increased serum PTH. Decreased serum phosphate. Increased urine calcium. Presence of parathyroid tumor shows on ultrasound. Fine needle biopsy of the parathyroid tumor. TREATMENT Surgical removal of the parathyroid tumor. Administer bisphosphonates to lower serum calcium by increasing calcium absorption in the bone. IV normal saline to dilute serum calcium. Diuretic such as furosemide to excrete excess calcium in the urine. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired urinary elimination Activity intolerance Fatigue related to sleep deprivation NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output. Monitor for fluid overload. Monitor electrolyte balance.358 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Force fluids. Give the patient acid-ash juices such as cranberry juice. Strain urine for kidney stones. Place the patient on a low-calcium and high-phosphorus diet. Explain to patient: Avoid over-the-counter calcium supplements. Maintain daily activities. Diabetes Mellitus WHAT WENT WRONG? Our body converts certain foods into glucose, which is the body's primary energy supply. Insulin from the beta cells of the pancreas is necessary to transport glu-cose into cells where it is used for cell metabolism. Diabetes mellitus occurswhen beta cells either are unable to produce insulin (Type I diabetes mellitus) orproduce an insufficient amount of insulin (Type II diabetes mellitus). As a result,glucose does not enter cells but remains in the blood. Increased glucose levels inthe blood signal to the patient to increase intake of fluid in an effort to flush glu-cose out of the body in urine. Patients then experience increased thirst andincreased urination. Cells become starved for energy because of the lack of glu-cose and signal to the patient to eat, causing the patient to experience an increasein hunger. There are three types of diabetes mellitus. These are Type I, known asinsulin-dependent (IDDM), where beta cells are destroyed by an autoimmuneprocess; Type II, known as non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM), where beta cellsproduce insufficient insulin; and gestational diabetes mellitus (DM that occursduring pregnancy). PROGNOSIS Patients with Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus are at risk for complicationssuch as vision loss (diabetic retinopathy), damage to blood vessels and nerves(diabetic neuropathy), and kidney damage (nephropathy). However, complicationscan be minimized by maintaining a normal blood glucose level through consistentmonitoring, administering insulin, and dieting. Patients with gestational diabetesmellitus will recover following pregnancy; however, they are at risk for develop-ing Type II diabetes mellitus later in life.15359 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOM Type I: Fast onset because no insulin is being produced Increased appetite (polyphagia) because cells are starved for energy, signals a need for more food Increased thirst (polydipsia) from the body attempting to rid itself of glucose Increased urination (polyuria) from the body attempting to rid itself ofglucose Weight loss since glucose is unable to enter cells Frequent infections as bacteria feeds on the excess glucose Delayed healing because elevated glucose levels in the blood hinders heal-ing process Type II: Slow onset because some insulin is being produced Increased thirst (polydipsia) from the body attempting to rid itself of glucose Increased urination (polyuria) from the body attempting to rid itself of glucose Candidal infection as bacteria feeds on the excess glucose Delayed healing because elevated glucose levels in the blood hinder thehealing process Gestational: Asymptomatic Some patients may experience increased thirst (polydipsia) from the bodyattempting to rid itself of glucose INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increased glucose in urine (glucosuria). Fasting plasma blood glucose test with a serum glucose level of 126 mg/dL(7.0 mmol/l) on three different tests. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with plasma glucose of 200 mg/dL (11.1mmol/l) two hours after ingesting 75 grams oral glucose. Random plasma glucose at or above 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l). Glycosylated hemoglobin A1C 6.0 percent or higher.360 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Type I: Regular monitoring of blood glucose.

Explain to the patient thatthis is a non-fasting blood test. Triiodothyronine (T3) Test This test measures the level of T3 in the blood in order to determine whether thethyroid is functioning properly. It is used primarily to help diagnose hyperthy-roidism and is usually ordered following an abnormal TSH or T4 test. Explain tothe patient that this is a non-fasting blood test. Thyroxine Total (T4) Test This test measures the amount of T4 in the blood and is ordered to evaluate thethyroid function and to help diagnose hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.Explain to the patient that this is a non-fasting blood test.369 CHAPTER 8 Endocrine System Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Test This blood test measures the level of TSH in the blood and is used to check for thyroid gland problems. It may be done at the same time as tests to measure T3and T4. Explain to the patient that this is a non-fasting blood test. Thyroid Scintiscan (Thyroid Scan) A radioactive substance is orally given to the patient, who returns at a designatedtime for a thyroid scan. The test is done to assess nodules as either hot (function-ing) which often indicates a goiter or a benign mass or cold (non-functioning)which may indicate a cancer, thyroiditis or other disease process. Before the test\u2014Find out whether the patient has any allergies to iodine or shell- fish. Speak to the practitioner about withholding thyroid medications before thetest. It is a non-invasive test. Urinary Catecholamines This test, a 24-hour urine test, measures the amount of the hormones epinephrine,norepinephrine, and dopamine in the body. The test is done to assess for pheo-chromocytoma (tumor of the adrenal gland) as the cause of elevated blood pressure. Before the test\u2014Instruct the patient to collect urine in a special container for a 24- hour period. Explain to the patient that the test is started in the morning. Discardthe first voided specimen, then save subsequent specimens, ending with the firstvoided specimen the following day. A preservative has been added to the containerand it must be refrigerated. Vasopressin Challenge Test This test is performed assess the ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine andto help determine which type of diabetes insipidus is present. Vasopressin isinjected subcutaneously. Serum and urine samples are collected at 1 to 2-hourintervals after the injection, and the osmolality of these samples is measured inthe laboratory. Before the test\u2014Explain to the patient that fluids are restricted the evening before the test and the patient must be NPO after midnight. Any extra fluid or food intakeinvalidates the test.370 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Quiz 1.

Click here for terms of use. 374 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified How the Genitourinary System Works The genitourinary system refers to the parts of the body involved in the production and transport of urine, as well as the surrounding structures. The kidneys are foundin the posterior part of the upper abdominal area, relatively protected by the lowerribs. They are lateral to the spinal column. The left kidney is found higher than theright kidney due to the location of the liver within the abdomen. The renal arterysupplies blood to the kidneys. The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, thearea where urine is formed. Within the nephron, there is a long tubule. This ini-tially surrounds the glomerulus in an area called Bowman's capsule. Bowman'scapsule narrows into a proximal convoluted tubule which has many curves andeventually straightens into a downward loop of Henle, which makes a sharp turnto come back up into the cortex of the kidney. The initial upward portion of theloop of Henle is thin and then becomes thick, which is the distal convoluted tubule. The kidneys are responsible for filtering wastes from the bloodstream; they aid in the control of fluid and electrolyte balance, acid-base balance, failureTesticular cancerUrinary tract infection 1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 10Learning Objectives375 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System control through production of renin, and red blood cell production through the pro- duction of erythropoetin. As urine is produced within the kidneys, it travels throughthe ducts (ureters) to the bladder. Once the body senses the urge to empty the blad-der, the detruser muscles contract and the sphincter at the bladder neck relaxes toaid in emptying the urine. The urine passes through the urethra to the outside. Malepatients have a prostate gland located under the bladder, surrounding the urethra. Prostatic fluid is secreted from the gland into the urethra. Just the Facts Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH) WHAT WENT WRONG? The prostate gland is found just below the bladder in men, surrounding the urethra.As men age, the prostate enlarges, putting pressure on the surrounding structures andcausing symptoms such as frequent urination and urinary retention. The enlarge-ment of the prostate causes narrowing of the urethra and upward pressure on thelower border of the bladder. Urinary retention may develop, as the body has a hardertime emptying the bladder. Hydronephrosis and dilation of the renal pelvis and ureterare complications of the urinary retention due to overgrowth of the prostate. PROGNOSIS The symptoms of BPH are the same as those for prostate cancer. It is important forthe patients to have regular check-ups to evaluate for risk of prostate cancer andconduct periodic screenings for prostate cancer. Renal function may be temporar-ily effected by hydronephrosis secondary to urinary retention. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Urinary hesitancy\u2014difficulty initiating stream of urine due to pressure onurethra and bladder neck Urinary frequency\u2014need to urinate frequently due to pressure on bladder Urinary urgency\u2014need to get to bathroom quickly to urinate due to pressureon bladder1376 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Nocturia\u2014need to get up at night to urinate due to pressure on bladder Decrease in force of urinary stream Intermittent stream of urination Hematuria INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Urography shows high volume of post-void residual urine. PSA (prostate-specific antigen) may be mildly elevated. Prostate ultrasound shows hypertrophy. Digital rectal exam reveals fullness of prostate and loss of median sulcus (midline groove between the two lateral lobes of the prostate). Urinalysis may show microscopic hematuria. BUN and creatinine levels may elevate, if renal function is impaired. TREATMENT Administer alpha1-blockers for symptom relief: doxazosin tamsulosin terazosin Monitor blood effect of some alpha1- blockers. Administer finasteride to relieve symptoms by shrinking prostate gland. Monitor PSA levels periodically. Monitor renal function. Surgical removal of prostate tissue to relieve pressure. Continuous bladder irrigation postoperatively. Administer antispasmodics for patients experiencing bladder spasms. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Risk for impaired urinary elimination Urinary retention Risk for urge urinary incontinence377 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System NURSING INTERVENTIONS Maintain the 3-port catheter postop. One port is for irrigation, another is for drainage, and the third to inflate a balloon that holds the catheter in position. Monitor intake and output. Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor postoperative patient's bladder irrigation: Monitor the amount of fluid instilled and the amount of fluid returned andsubtract the amount of fluid instilled from the amount returned to deter-mine the actual urine output. Document color of urinary output postoperatively; the greatest risk of hem-orrhage is the first day after the operation. Monitor for bladder spasms which may indicate blocked catheter drainagepostoperatively. Teach patient: Avoid caffeine, alcohol, decongestants, anticholinergics which may increase symptoms of BPH. Proper home care of urinary catheter. Monitor for signs of urinary tract infection. Bladder Cancer WHAT WENT WRONG? Bladder cancer is typically a nonaggressive cancer that occurs in the transitionalcell layer of the bladder. It is recurrent in nature. Less frequently, bladder cancer isfound invading deeper layers of the bladder tissue. In these cases the cancer tendsto be more aggressive. Exposure to industrial chemicals (paints, textiles), history ofcyclophosphamide use, and smoking increase the risks for bladder cancer. PROGNOSIS The more aggressive the cancer cell type, the greater the risk of metastasis of thedisease. Patients may have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. The moreadvanced the disease at the time of diagnosis and the more aggressive the tumor,the greater the risk of death for the patient.2378 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fatigue\u2014due to chronic process Hematuria\u2014blood in urine, may be microscopic Change in urinary pattern\u2014color, frequency, or amount of urine INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Urinalysis shows red blood cells in urine. Cystoscopy to identify tumor site and obtain biopsy. Bladder biopsy shows cancer cell type. CT scan shows metastasis or invasion of tumor. TREATMENT Surgical removal of tumor: May be removal of superficial tumor from bladder wall with transurethral approach; removal of part or all of the bladder. If all of the bladder is removed, a stoma is created on the surface of theabdomen or an ileal reservoir is created internally to collect the urine. Instillation of BCG (bacilli Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) into bladder to decrease chanceof recurrence. Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Risk of impaired urinary elimination Disturbed body image Fear Powerlessness NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs. Monitor intake and output: Document amount and color of drainage from all drains.379 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System Monitor color of urine. Monitor stoma for color, checking adequate blood flow to tissue. Monitor abdomen for bowel sounds, pain, distention. Monitor skin for signs of breakdown, redness. Monitor for side effects of medications. Teach patient: Proper skin care postoperatively. Catheterization of ileal reservoir if needed. Acute Glomerulonephritis WHAT WENT WRONG? Glomerulonephritis, also known as acute nephritic syndrome, is typically preceded by an ascending infection or occurs secondary to another systemic disorder. In-fectious causes include group A beta-hemolytic pneumococcal infection. Systemic disorders include systemic lupuserythematosus, viral hepatitis B or C, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, or mul-tiple myeloma. PROGNOSIS Depending on the cause, the acute episode may completely resolve. Patientsshould be monitored during the occurrence; signs of renal function need to bechecked. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Hematuria Peripheral edema Elevated blood pressure, compared with patient's norm Oliguria\u2014decrease in urine output Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite as renal function declines3380 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Urinalysis shows red blood cells and red blood cell casts. Glomerular filtration rate will be decreased. 24-hour urine collection for protein will be elevated. BUN level will be increased. Serum albumin will be decreased. Renal biopsy to determine cause. TREATMENT Monitor renal function. Monitor electrolyte levels. Monitor vital signs. Administer diuretics to remove excess fluids. Monitor urinary output. Restrict fluid intake\u2014measure output, intake should match 24-hour output plus 500 cc. Plasmapheresis if due to autoimmune cause. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Impaired urinary elimination Excess fluid volume NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs. Monitor intake and output. Weigh daily. Assess respiratory system for lung sounds, difficulty breathing, crackles inlungs suggesting fluid overload. Assess cardiovascular status, heart rate, heart sounds, presence of S3sug- gesting fluid overload.381 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System Assess extremities for edema. Teach patient about medications, disease process. Kidney Cancer WHAT WENT WRONG? Kidney cancer occurs when cancer cells create a tumor within the kidney. Ex- posure to chemicals, lead, and smoking all increase the risk of developing kidneycancer. PROGNOSIS Identification of renal cancer is integral to a favorable outcome. Patients oftenhave vague symptoms and may not seek healthcare until later in the disease whenthe cancer is well developed. Metastatic disease has the worst prognosis. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Weight loss Anemia due to altered erythropoetin production Hematuria Elevated blood pressure due to increase in renin production Flank pain, dull or aching, occurs in small amount of patients INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CBC may show either anemia or erythrocytosis. Urinalysis shows red blood cells. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevated. Ultrasound shows renal mass. CT scan with contrast shows renal mass. MRI shows renal mass.4382 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Surgical removal by nephrectomy. Tumor destruction by radiofrequency ablation. Chemotherapy. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Fear Impaired skin integrity Risk of impaired urinary elimination NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor intake and output. Monitor operative site for redness, swelling, and bleeding. Monitor pain level postoperatively. Hourly urine output monitoring for first 24 to 48 hours postoperatively. Monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit as scheduled. Monitor for signs of infection postoperatively. Kidney Stones WHAT WENT WRONG? Kidney stones, also known as renal calculi or nephrolithiasis, occur within the kid- neys. Stones can also form elsewhere within the urinary tract. The patient may nothave any symptoms from kidney stones until the stone attempts to move down theureter towards the bladder. Patients develop crystals within the urine. A slow flowof urine gives the crystals time to form a stone. Crystals may be formed from cal-cium, uric acid, cystine, or struvite. Medications such as diuretics can increase therisk of kidney stone formation in some patients.5383 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System PROGNOSIS A stone may lodge in the ureter blocking the flow of urine. Hydronephrosis and swelling of the ureter may follow. Kidney stones typically recur, especially in thosewith a family history of nephrolithiasis. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Hematuria Unilateral spasms of pain in the flank area (renal colic) Pain may radiate to lower abdomen, groin, scrotum or labia Nausea, vomiting, and sweating associated with occurrence of pain Elevated blood pressure with pain Extreme flank pain that comes slowly or quickly INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Urinalysis shows red blood cells. Ultrasound shows stones. X-ray of kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) shows stones. CT scan shows stones. MRI shows stones. TREATMENT Provide pain relief: narcotics such as morphine non-narcotics such as ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory Administer antispasmodics as adjuncts for pain control. Increase fluid intake to flush through the urinary tract. Lithotripsy\u2014shock waves are used to break the stone into very small piecesthat can pass more easily. Stent placement to allow free flow of urine and passage of small stones orstone pieces. Surgical removal of stone.384 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING DIAGNOSIS Risk of impaired urinary elimination Acute pain NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor intake and output. Monitor pain level and response to pain medications. Strain urine to obtain stone for analysis in lab. Teach patient about: Adequate fluid intake. Medications used to reduce chance of recurrence. Dietary modifications needed based on content of stone. Prostate Cancer WHAT WENT WRONG? Cancer of the prostate typically is found in the peripheral area of the prostate gland. Nodules may be palpable on digital rectal exam. There is a greater inci-dence as men age. African-American males and those with a family history of thedisease have a higher risk for prostate cancer. The symptoms of prostate cancer arethe same as those of benign prostatic hypertrophy. PROGNOSIS Prostate cancer is the most common cancer found in American males, and the sec-ond leading cancer-related cause of death. The number of cases of prostate cancerfound on autopsy are even higher than those found clinically. Screening for prostatecancer has increased the number of cases identified. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Urinary hesitancy\u2014difficulty initiating stream of urine due to pressure onurethra and bladder neck6385 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System Urinary frequency\u2014need to urinate frequently due to pressure on bladder Urinary urgency\u2014need to get to bathroom quickly to urinate due to pressure on bladder Nocturia\u2014need to get up at night to urinate due to pressure on bladder Decrease in force of urinary stream Intermittent stream of urination Hematuria Palpable nodule on digital rectal examination Urinary retention due to enlargement of the tumor, blocking flow of urine Back pain due to metastasis INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS PSA elevates as tumor size increases. Digital rectal exam may reveal nodule. Transrectal ultrasound used to identify prostate cancer and determine the stage. MRI to identify prostate lesions and involvement of surrounding tissue orlymph nodes. Biopsy to identify cell type. Alkaline phosphatase elevates with metastasis to bone. TREATMENT Radiation therapy: External beam. Brachytherapy\u2014insertion of radioactive substance into prostate. Surgery\u2014radical prostatectomy. Chemotherapy. Cryosurgery\u2014freezing of tissue with ultrasound guidance. Watchful waiting\u2014monitoring PSA and ultrasound depending on patient'sage and cell type of cancer and any comorbidities. Hormonal treatment to suppress natural androgen Demystified NURSING DIAGNOSIS Fear Impaired urinary elimination Pain NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs. Monitor intake and output. Assess abdomen for signs of bladder distention due to urinary retention. Assess for pain in back. Assess skin for signs of redness or breakdown if undergoing radiation treatments. Monitor for side effects of medications. Pyelonephritis WHAT WENT WRONG? Pyelonephritis is an infection involving the kidneys. Inflammation of the tissueaccompanies the infectious process. The most common bacteria are E. coli, Kleb-siella, Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas, andStaphylococcus saprophyticus. Typically the infection the lower urinary tract and ascends upward. Identi-fication of infections and initiation of treatment is important to prevent the infec-tion from getting worse. PROGNOSIS Older patients and patients with comorbidities have a greater chance of complica-tions from pyelonephritis. Impaired renal function may complicate recovery insome patients. Septic shock may occur. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Flank pain Fever due to infection7387 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System Chills Frequency, urgency, dysuria due to urinary tract infection Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea due to infection Increased heart rate due to fever Costovertebral angle (CV A) tenderness INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Urinalysis shows leukocytes, bacteria, nitrites, and red blood cells; may see white blood cell casts. Urine culture identifies organism. Sensitivity shows which antibiotics the organism is most responsive to. CBC shows leukocytosis. TREATMENT Administer antibiotics to treat infection\u2014intravenous or oral depending onseverity of fever. Administer fluids for dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea. Administer phenazopyridine for relief of dysuria symptoms. Repeat urine culture after completion of antibiotic course. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Impaired urinary elimination Nausea Hyperthermia388 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs. Monitor intake and output. Assess for side effects of medication. Teach patient that phenazopyridine will cause orange-colored urine. Renal Failure WHAT WENT WRONG? A decrease in renal function can occur in an acute (sudden) or a chronic (pro- gressive) manner. Acute renal failure can be broken down into pre-renal, renal, andpost-renal. Prerenal causes result from diminished renal perfusion. Hypovolemiadue to blood or fluid losses, diuretic use, third-spacing of fluids, reduced renalperfusion due to NSAID use or CHF can cause pre-renal failure. Renal failure inacute care patients most commonly results from acute tubular necrosis. Drug-related reac tions, particularly to antibiotics, may cause an allergic interstitial nephritis. Pylenonephritis or glomerulonephritis may also cause renal failure.Post-renal failure is due to some type of urinary tract obstruction, bladder outletobstruction, stone, prostate hypertrophy, or compression of ureter due to abdom-inal mass. Chronic renal failure is an irreversible disease due to damaging effects on the kidneys caused by diabetes mellitus, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, HIV infec-tion, polycystic kidney disease, or ischemic nephropathy. PROGNOSIS In acute renal failure, kidneys start working following intensive treatment and rec-tifying the underlying condition that caused the problem. In chronic renal failure,the patient can die as a result of complications of the disease. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Azotemia\u2014elevated BUN and creatinine If hypovolemic (pre-renal), skin, andmucous membranes8389 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System Weight loss due to chronic disease Abdominal bruit with ischemic nephropathy Peripheral edema with third spacing of fluids Decreased urinary output Uremic pruritis\u2014see excoriations from scratching Anemia in chronic disease\u2014kidneys produce erythropoetin INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS BUN elevated. Creatinine elevated. BUN/creatinine ratio elevated. Urinalysis may show casts (hyaline or granular in acute prerenal; RBC, WBC in renal), proteinuria. Glomerular filtration rate decreases in chronic disease. Creatinine clearance decreases. Renal ultrasound shows decrease in renal size in chronic renal failure; dila-tion and fluid build up in post-renal failure. TREATMENT Treatment needs to address the underlying disease process. What will correct onecause may make another cause worse. Administer intravenous fluids to correct hypovolemia. Administer inotropic agents for patients with CHF to enhance cardiac output. Administer antibiotics for pyelonephritis. Stent placement or catheter (urethral, suprapubic, nephrostomy) to allow fordrainage of urine if blockage present. Dialysis. Administer erythropoetin to treat anemia. Restrict potassium, phosphate, sodium, and protein in diet. Administer phosphate binders to reduce phosphate levels. Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate to reduce potassium levels. Monitor electrolyte levels.390 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Control blood pressure. Control blood glucose levels. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Impaired urinary elimination Ineffective tissue perfusion (renal) Fear NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs for changes in heart rate or blood pressure. Monitor intake and output. Assess intravenous site for redness, swelling, or pain. Check dialysis access site for signs of infection. Check A V shunt for thrill (palpable turbulence of bloodflow; gently feel for flow of blood through shunt) and bruit (audible turbulence of bloodflow;listen with stethoscope for sound of bloodflow through shunt). No contrast dye tests. No nephrotoxic medication. Monitor patient very closely. Testicular Cancer WHAT WENT WRONG? Cancer involving the testicle typically occurs in males in their teens or twenties.The cancer is hormonally dependent and tends to metastasize fairly quickly tolungs or to bone. A painless nodule may be found by the patient. There is anincreased incidence in patients with a history of cryptorchism. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is better for patients with solitary nodules that have not had a chance tometastasize. Tumors that have already metastasized to other locations have a9391 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System poorer prognosis. The diagnosis will also have varied degrees of psychological impact on the patient. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Painless enlargement of the testis Palpable mass on surface of testis Unilateral feeling of heaviness in the scrotum Testicular pain due to bleeding within the testis in a small percentage of patients Back pain due to metastasis Cough or shortness of breath due to pulmonary metastasis INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Scrotal ultrasound shows mass on testis. CT scan of pelvis, abdomen, and chest may be needed to check for metastasis. Human chorionic gonadotropin CBC shows anemia later in disease. TREATMENT Orchiectomy. Chemotherapy, combination medications. Radiation therapy to reduce chance of recurrence. Monitor tumor markers periodically. Monitor follow-up CT scans periodically. Depending on treatments planned, some patients may want to bank sperm, iffertility will be a concern after treatment. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Fear Anxiety Disturbed body image392 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs. Monitor intake and output. Assess patient's coping abilities. Teach patient testicular self-exam. Urinary Tract Infection WHAT WENT WRONG? Urinary tract infection occurs when an infecting organism, typically a gram negative bacteria such as E. coli, enters the urinary tract. Inflammation of the local areaoccurs, followed by infection as the organism reproduces. Often the bacteria is pres-ent on the skin in the genital area and enters the urinary tract through the urethralopening. The organism can also be introduced during sexual contact. The infectionoccurs as an uncomplicated, community-acquired infection in this setting. Patientswith a urinary catheter in place may also develop an infection due to the presenceof the catheter which allows a pathway for the bacteria to enter the bladder.Instrumentation of the urinary tract, e.g. cystoscopy, also allows a pathway for bac-teria to enter the bladder. Some of the instruments are not completely sterilizedbetween patients; they are treated with a high-level disinfectant due to fiberopticsand lenses within because they would not withstand the high temperatures neededto sterilize. These infections would be considered nosocomial. PROGNOSIS Urinary tract infections that are identified are typically treated and resolve. Some bac-teria have become resistant to certain antibiotics, so testing the urine to be sure theinfection has cleared after treatment is a good idea. Infections that are left untreatedcan progress and travel upward through the urinary tract to involve the kidneys orbecome a systemic infection or sepsis, especially in elderly or infirm patients. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Frequency due to irritation of bladder muscles Urgency due to irritation of bladder muscles10393 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System Dysuria due to irritation of mucosal lining Feeling of fullness in suprapubic area Low back pain INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Urinalysis shows leukocytes, nitrites, and red blood cells. Urine culture and sensitivity indicates the infecting organism and the appro- priate antibiotic to treat the levofloxacin ofloxacin trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ampicillin urine less concentrated. Administer phenazopyridine for symptoms of dysuria. Repeat urine testing after antibiotics are completed. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Risk of impaired urinary elimination Risk of urge urinary incontinence NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor intake and output. Monitor vital signs for changes, signs of fever. Encourage fluid intake. Encourage cranberry juice to acidify urine. Teach patient that phenazopyridine will cause orange-colored urine.394 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Crucial Diagnostic Tests Culture and Sensitivity Tests The culture test checks for the presence of bacteria in the urine. The sensitivity test determines what antibiotics can be used to eliminate the bacteria. The laboratorydivides the urine specimen in half; one part is cultured to determine which bacte-ria grow. A preliminary report should be available in 24 hours. The second half isis used to determine to which antibiotics the organism(s) are sensitive. Before the test\u2014Explain to the patient that the specimen must be obtained before an antibiotic can be started or the results will be altered. Cystoscopy This test examines the bladder walls to check for tumors and growths. It is alsoused as a therapeutic tool to remove small tumors, stones, and foreign bodies andto dilate the urethra and ureters. A cystoscope is inserted into the urethra to thebladder, which allows structures to be actually visualized; i.e. urethra, bladder,ureters, and prostate. Before the test\u2014Explain to the patient that this test may be performed under gen- eral, light or local anesthesia. It will be uncomfortable if the patient is awake.Obtain informed consent. After the test\u2014Advise the patient to increase fluids to flush out bacteria that may have been introduced with the cystoscope. Bladder muscle spasms may result. Thepatient should expect some pink urine following the test. Frank, red blood warrantsa call to the physician. Observe for signs of a UTI\u2014chills, fever, frequent, uncom-fortable voiding, pelvic discomfort. Kidney, Ureter, Bladder (KUB) X-ray Study The KUB study is an abdominal x-ray used to detect kidney stones, abdominal abscesses, paralytic ileus or obstruction. Explain to the patient that this is not aninvasive procedure.395 CHAPTER 9 Genitourinary System Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Test This test measures the level of PSA in the blood. The level will be elevated in patients with BPH (benign prostatic hypertrophy) or prostate cancer. ElevatedPSA levels alone do not give doctors enough information to distinguish betweenbenign prostate conditions and cancer; however, the doctor will take the testresults into account when deciding whether to order additional screening forprostate cancer. The test is also used to monitor treatment and to test for recur-rences of prostate cancer. Before the test\u2014Explain to the patient that rectal and prostate exams, ejaculation, UTI, and prostatitis will all elevate a PSA level. 24-Hour Urine Collection This is a diagnostic test that involves collecting a patient's urine for 24 hours. It istypically used to measure volume and various other factors of kidney function aswell as to determine the daily elimination of such substances as proteins, elec-trolytes, etc. Before the test\u2014Explain to the patient that the test is started in the morning. Discard the first voided specimen, then save subsequent specimens, ending withthe first voided specimen the following day. The urine collection jug should bekept on ice or under refrigeration. Urinalysis Urinalysis is the physical, chemical, and microscopic examination of urine. Itinvolves a number of tests to evaluate the urine specimen for appearance, color,clarity, pH, specific gravity, and the presence of bacteria, blood, casts, glucose,ketones, leukocytes, proteins, RBCs, and WBCs. The tests are used to confirmsymptoms of a UTI, to check diabetics for excess glucose levels, and to monitorthe kidney function of renal patients. Before the test\u2014Explain to the patient that many drugs affect a urine specimen. Some samples, as when ascertaining the presence of an infection, may need to be\"clean catch\" or \"midstream clean\" collection. The perineum or urethral openingshould be cleansed, and the voiding stream started. Without stopping the stream,position the sterile container into the flow of urine. When the container is more396 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified than half full, withdraw from the flow of urine. Allow the patient to finish empty- ing the bladder. Tightly cap and send to the laboratory immediately. Urine Flow Studies Urine flow studies, also known as uroflowmetry, measure the strength and volumeper second of urine flow from the bladder when a patient urinates into a testmachine. They help identify an obstruction or abnormality of the urinary tract andassist in evaluating how well or poorly a patient is urinating. Before the test\u2014Explain to the patient not to urinate for a few hours before the test and to drink enough fluids to develop an urge to urinate . It is not an invasive test.They will need to void into a flowmeter. Voiding Cystogram This test involves taking an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra during urina-tion. A radiopaque contrast material is instilled into the bladder via a Foleycatheter. After x-rays are taken, the catheter is removed. The patient voids whilemore x-rays are obtained. This test is performed to look for defects of the urinarysystem, for tumors of the bladder, ureters, and urethra, or for reflux of urine fromthe bladder to the ureters. Before the test\u2014Explain to the patient that the presence of the catheter will feel like the urge to urinate. Obtain informed consent. Check for allergies to contrastmaterial. Advise the patient to increase po fluids before and after test to aid the kid-neys in removal of contrast material. Quiz 1.

It pre- vents dehydration, regulates body temperature, and is the major deterrent of infec-tion in the body. When this barrier is broken, whether by surgical incision, wound,cut, or scrape, the primary defense is no longer intact. Superficial breaks in the skinmay be treated on an outpatient basis. However, deeper wounds, and those involv-ing the face and neck, may need more intense care with IV antibiotics. Skin is com-prised of several layers and is waterproof. Many skin manifestations are describedusing common terms. Macules are small, flat-topped lesions, less than 1 cm in diam-eter, similar to a freckle. Papules are elevated lesions, also smaller than 1 cm indiameter. A wheal is a raised area filled with fluid and usually temporary, such asin hives. A vesicle is a fluid-filled blister, often seen in shingles. Bullae are largerthan 1 cm in diameter and are fluid-filled blisters. A plaque (sticky deposits thatattaches to the inner lining of an artery) is greater than 1 cm in diameter, raised, andshallow. A nodule is a solid lesion, up to 1 cm in diameter with depth. A tumor islarger than 1 cm in diameter, and is solid with depth. A pustule is an elevation con-taining purulent material. Petechiae are smaller than 1 cm in diameter and are usu-ally round areas of deposits of blood. A purpura is a large ulcers Wounds and healing1 2 34 5 6401 CHAPTER 10 Integumentary System Just the Facts Burns WHAT WENT WRONG? Burns are damage to the skin and body tissues caused by flames, heat, cold, fric- tion, radiation (sunburn), chemicals, or electricity. Burns are generally divided intothree categories, depending on the damage. First-degree burns are those withinjury to the outer layer of skin called the epidermis. They will be red, and painful,with some swelling. A second-degree burn is when the epidermis is burned, as wellas the next layer, the dermis. Severe pain, white and reddened areas, swelling, blis-ters, and perhaps drainage will be seen. A third-degree burn goes through all thelayers of the skin and could involve underlying tissues. It is often painless due todestruction of the nerves in the area. The area will look black (termed eschar)and/or reddened. Many drugs may make the skin more sensitive to the sun, pro-ducing the effect of a sunburn with little exposure. Common medications with among others. PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on the severity of the burn plus the amount of surface areainvolved. When large portions of the face, chest, hands, feet, genitalia, or jointshave sustained a large second- or third-degree burn, prompt medical attention isnecessary. Serious burns can lead to death. If smoke inhalation has occurred, or ifthe nasal hairs are singed, or if quantities of soot are present around the face, assessfor adequacy of breathing and damage to the respiratory tract. CPR may need to bestarted. Infants and elderly patients with burns require prompt medical attention. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Redness, no break in skin\u2014indicates a first-degree burn from damage to theepidermis Deeper red, with clear fluid blisters\u2014indicates a second-degree burn as theepidermis and dermis are burned1402 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Charred black or dry white\u2014indicates death of the tissue from the burn (third- degree burn) INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Pulse oximetry\u2014a sensor is placed on the finger, toe, or earlobe to assess theamount of oxygen in the blood to ensure adequate oxygenation. Pulmonary function tests show how well the lungs are working. The patientbreathes into a machine, a spirometer, which records changes in the lung sizewith inhalation and exhalation and the time it takes to perform this test. Rule of nines\u2014a way of measurement to estimate the total body surface areaburned: head, 9 percent; anterior torso, 18 percent; posterior torso, 18 per-cent; each leg, 18 percent; each arm, 9 percent; perineum, 1 percent. TREATMENT The objective of burn treatment is to prevent infection, decrease inflammation andpain, and promote healing of the areas. Treatment choices depend on the degree ofburn and the amount of body surface area that was burned. Any second-degree burngreater than 5 to 10 percent of surface area and all third-degree burns belong in ahospital, preferably within a specialized burn unit. All electrical burns and burnsof the ears, eyes, face, hands, feet, and perineum require hospital care, as do chem-ical burns and burns in infants or the elderly. Check the area for any exposed electrical wires, if you are present on the scene. Use cold water to decrease the temperature of the area for a first-degree burnor a small second-degree burn and to stop the burning. For chemical burns, ensure that all the chemical has been flushed away. For electrical burns, look for entrance and exit wounds. Cover the area with dry gauze. If the skin is broken (second-degree burn), use a topical antibiotic ointment suchas silvadene to prevent a secondary bacterial infection before applying the gauze. Administer pain medications (ibuprofen, acetaminophen) as needed. For third-degree burns, the eschar needs to be debrided (cut away) to allownew tissue to grow. These wounds are often covered in moist sterile saline gauze, as new tissuegrows best in this environment. When the gauze dries; it adheres to the deadtissue. The area is mechanically debrided when the gauze is removed.403 CHAPTER 10 Integumentary System Oral antibiotics may be necessary. Administer pain medications (oxycodone, morphine) as needed, especially before dressing changes that may be painful. Prevent heat loss due to large areas of tissue exposed from lack of skincoverage. Maintain fluid levels since fluid loss is common from evaporation andwound drainage. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk of fluid volume deficit Pain, discomfort Risk of altered body temperature NURSING INTERVENTION Anticipate pain medication needs to make the patient more comfortable. Assist in range of motion to avoid contracture development due to pain withmovement. Encourage family visitation. Assist with activities of daily living. Isolation may be needed to protect the patient from bacteria, especially if alarge amount of skin is not intact. Teach the patient to look for signs and symptoms of infection: fever, increasedredness, increase in drainage, or change in color of drainage. Dermatitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Inflammation of the skin as a result of contact with an irritating substance such as achemical, foreign substance, medication, or contact with a plant, such as poison ivy.The skin may become reddened, irritated, and itchy. The usual causes are allergicreactions. Often the patient has a history or a family history of asthma, allergy, or2404 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified eczema. Some later symptoms may be the result of scratching of the skin. Often the cause may be a drug reaction, the body's immune system reacting to a medication. PROGNOSIS Resolution of the rash occurs within one to two weeks once the offending sub-stance is identified and removed. However, if the patient is atopic, frequent exac-erbations and remissions may occur with unknown etiology. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Rash on the affected skin area from contact with the offending substance Pruritis from histamine release from mast cells Erythema and edema Vesicles where the substance came in contact with the skin Hyperpigmentation from irritation from scratching INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS RAST testing may be done to determine allergens. Patch testing. TREATMENT Treatment involves determining, if able, the triggers that began the flare, andavoidance of the same. Treatment aimed at each symptom will help to decreasediscomfort. If the dermatitis is widespread, IV medications, steroids, or antihista-mines may be necessary to resolve the flare. Topical corticosteroid cream, gel, orlotions will decrease the symptoms. NURSING DIAGNOSES Body image disturbance Risk of altered skin integrity Pain, discomfort405 CHAPTER 10 Integumentary System NURSING INTERVENTION Avoid irritants that caused the dermatitis to prevent recurrence. Allow for healing and prevent bacterial infections. Cool compresses. Use protective gloves and clothing. Wash hands often. Explain to patient: Keep the skin moist. Keep nails short to diminish scratching. Warm, not hot, showers. Use mild soap. Apply moisturizers. Skin Cancers Cancers of the skin are the most common type of cancer. The incidence of skin can- cer is one of the fastest growing. Early detection is of the utmost importance becausea cure is obtainable in the early stages. Heredity may also be a factor. Skin cancer isusually divided into three major subtypes: basal cell, the most common; squamouscell, which is the second most common; and melanoma, the most fearsome . Basal cell carcinomas are directly related to sun damage, with most lesions occurring in sun-exposed areas. This type recurs frequently. Squamous cell carcinomas are often dueto sun-exposure, may be difficult to distinguish from some changes in the skin, andspread more readily. Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer; it usu ally occurs on the face or upper back. A mnemonic to aid in melanoma characteristics pencil eraser; E\u2014ever changing. WHAT WENT WRONG? New skin cells are made in the epidermis, which then push the older cells toward thesurface where they are shed. Solar exposure can interrupt this process, causingcells to divide at an unusual rate, which may lead to a cancer. Those individualswith a large amount of exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which appears to becumulative, are more at risk to develop cancerous tumors. Exposure to greater3406 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified amounts of x-rays also increase the risk for skin cancers, as does arsenic which is a metal found in the environment and in our food. People who take immunosup-presant medications are at a greater risk for skin cancers as are fair-skinned peo-ple and those with a family history of skin cancer. PROGNOSIS If the lesion is identified and treated early, prognosis is excellent. Follow-up carewith frequent skin assessments is mandatory. Basal cell cancers are unlikely tohave a poor prognosis. Squamous cell tumors may spread if left unchecked. Mela-noma is staged by determining thickness of the lesion, and the extent to which ithas spread. Stage 0 is a confined tumor. The other stages mean the cancer hasspread to other tissues, and organs. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Basal cell\u2014pearly white, waxy-appearing papule or a flat, cell\u2014firm red nodule; a flat scaly lesion; a change in a scar Melanoma\u2014any mole that is new, that has changed, and/or that meets anyof the ABCDE criteria INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Biopsy with an interpretation by a pathologist. TREATMENT Treatment is dependent upon the type of cancer, location, and size of the tumor. Surgical excision involves removing the tumor and surrounding healthy tis-sue to ensure all the cancerous tissue has been extracted. Cryosurgery in which the cells are killed by freezing with liquid nitrogen. Mohs' surgery where the tumor is removed layer by layer. Each surface areais evaluated microscopically, to ascertain that no cancer cells are present inthe remaining tissue. Laser treatments to vaporize the cancer cells. Topical creams and ointments.407 CHAPTER 10 Integumentary System Radiation used to kill cancer cells in melanoma. Chemotherapy, using drugs to kill the melanoma cells. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired skin integrity Body image disturbance NURSING INTERVENTION Stay out of the sun when its rays are the strongest. Avoid tanning salons. Wear sunscreen. Wear sun-protective clothing. Check the skin regularly for new moles, as well as changes in existing moles, freckles, and birthmarks. Medications may make the skin more sensitive to sunlight. Cellulitis WHAT WENT WRONG? Cellulitis is an infection of the skin, caused by bacteria that enter the skin throughan opening. The legs are the most common site of cellulitis, although it may occuranywhere bacteria enters. The most common bacteria are streptococcus and staphy-lococcus. Bacteria may enter through fissures in the feet from fungal infections,through cracks in dry skin, from insect bites, or cuts from shaving. The elderly,immunocompromised patients, and patients with lymphedema, diabetes, or poorcirculation are at greatest risk. PROGNOSIS If treatment is started early, the prognosis is good. If the symptoms don't begin to resolve or the infection is on the face or widespread, hospitalization and IV anti-biotics are needed. A severe cellulitis of deep tissue, necrotizing fasciitis, is causedby a streptococcal bacteria and is considered a medical emergency.4408 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Hot, red skin over the area of infection Swollen and painful skin and tissue due to the infection INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CBC to check on the white blood cell count. Culture of the wound to identify the organism causing the cellulitis. Ultrasound of the leg to rule out a DVT\u2014deep vein thrombosis. TREATMENT Treatment for a beginning infection is oral antibiotics. If fever and body aches accompany the infection or if the face is involved or the area is extensive, hospi-talization may be necessary. Empiric treatment is started immediately and is effec-tive against the most common bacteria. Cephalexin. Dicloxacillin. Levofloxacin. Tetanus booster if needed. Drainage of abscess by a surgeon if necessary. Pain medications. NURSING DIAGNOSES Pain, discomfort Risk of infection Impaired skin integrity NURSING INTERVENTION Explain to the patient the importance of good hygiene. Wash the affected area daily. Use a topical antibiotic ointment and a dry dressing twice daily. Elevate the area if possible.409 CHAPTER 10 Integumentary System Monitor for temperature, enlarging area of redness, increase in drainage. Explain to the patient how to prevent openings in the skin by using proper skin care interventions. Monitor feet and legs daily for cracks, fissures. Use care in trimming nails, or visit podiatrist. Use moisturizing lotions regularly. Pressure Ulcers WHAT WENT WRONG? A pressure ulcer starts on the skin and often progresses to deeper tissue; it is causedby impaired circulation to the tissue from pressure over a period of time. Withoutadequate blood flow and the nutrition it brings, the tissue will die. Those oftenaffected are confined to a wheelchair or bed, and unable to move themselves, notreducing the pressure frequently enough. It can take as little as a few hours in oneposition for a stage one pressure ulcer to develop. The usual sites of pressureulcers, or bedsores, are on bony prominences, such as the buttocks, sacrum, heels,knees, and hips. Friction from linens can impair the integrity of the skin as can theshear force, when the skin moves in one direction and the deeper structures don'tmove. Assessment tools are available to predict the risk of pressure ulcers devel-oping. A commonly used scale is the Braden scale which includes such criteria asfriction, the nutritional status of the patient, mobility and activity levels, moistureexposure of the skin and any limitations of sensory perception. PROGNOSIS Unfortunately, prognosis is poor. The very factors that caused the pressure ulcerare the same factors that interfere with healing. Resolution often is very involvedand slow. Setbacks are common, such as wound infection, cellulitis, and sepsis,which can lead to death. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Stage I: Firm warm areas of skin from poor circulation Spongy, reddened tissue from increased pressure5410 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Stage II: Opening in the skin with surrounding erythema from pressure Stage III: The ulcer is deep, down to the dermis, with red base and some drainage Stage IV: A deep ulcer involving muscle and bone, with visible signs of tissue death INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Culture to check for bacteria content. CBC to evaluate the hemoglobin and hematocrit for oxygen-carrying capa- bilities. Albumin and pre-albumin levels to check on nutrition. Chemistry to evaluate fluid status. TREATMENT Treatment is based on relieving pressure and providing adequate nutrition. Woundtreatment is aimed at preventing infection and encouraging healing. Stage I andstage II wounds may heal with conservative treatments. However, stage III and stageIV wounds often require surgical debridement and skin grafting. Treatment choicedepends on the stage of the wound. Clean wound with soap and water or saline. Debridement to clean away dead, devitalized, and infected tissue. Debridementmethods include surgery, topical enzymatics, and mechanical debridement. Dressings to protect the wound and keep it moist, which promotes healing. Hydrocolloids which keep moisture in. Nonadherant dressings, such as aquaphor. Bulk dressings to absorb copious drainage. Semipermeable dressings which allow for transfer of gases but are imper-meable to liquids. Antibiotic ointment for infected wounds. Oral antibiotics. Specialized matresses. Whirlpool treatments.411 CHAPTER 10 Integumentary System NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired skin integrity Impaired physical mobility Nutrition altered: less than what body requires NURSING INTERVENTION Prevention is the key to pressure ulcers. Mobility or repositioning of patients unable to move themselves; every 1 to 2 hours. Proper nutrition to encourage healing. Adequate fluid intake. Remove pressure from stage I areas. Use pillows to reduce pressure. Use specialized wheelchair cushions to reduce pressure. Daily skin inspection. Stop smoking in order to increase oxygen to tissues. Daily measurement of wounds to assess status including length, width, anddepth. Wounds and Healing A wound is any break in the skin. It may be intentional, as with surgery, or unin-tentional, as a result of trauma. Types of wounds include surgical, penetrating (suchas a knife), crushing, burn, lacerations, bites, (human, animal), ulcers, and pressureulcers. Immediately after a wound occurs, inflammation begins with platelet aggre-gation. Next, leukocytes travel to the area for infection surveillance. A prolifera-tive phase starts when the epidermal cells move toward the wound, and cover theapproximated wound edges, usually by the third day. The fibroblastic phase occurswith collagen and fibroblasts forming a scar. Wound healing occurs in various ways. Primary intention happens when edges are closely approximated and new tissue, or granulation, knits the close edgestogether. Wound healing by secondary intention occurs in a larger wound wherethe edges are further apart. This is often intentional when the wound is infected,dirty, or from a bite. The granulation tissue builds across the surface of the woundforming a large clot and sequentially, a larger scar.6412 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on the size, location, and cause of the wound. Items which need to be assessed in patients with wounds include chronic disease, such as dia-betes, impaired circulation; nutrition; Epithelialization of woundoccurs within 48 hours, wound strength is 60 percent of previous strength within4 months. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Pain from injury to nerves Drainage from injury to tissues and cells migrating to the site of injury Bleeding from injury to blood vessels Foreign body\u2014look for penetrating objects Deeper tissue trauma\u2014assess for nonintact tendons, ligaments, and pieces ofbone Debris\u2014look for dirt, fragments Signs and symptoms of infection include increased erythema; purulent, foul-smelling drainage; and fever Wounds may be accompanied by pain, drainage, bleeding, infection, a for-eign body, or deeper tissue trauma. Assessment of the wound, includingdeeper structures if necessary, is imperative. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CBC to assess for leukocytoses for infection. Chemistry to assess hydration status. TREATMENT Assess circulation if the wound is in a limb. Check distal pulses. Tetanus prophylaxis as needed. A booster is indicated if the last one was notwithin the past ten years. Irrigation of the wound with large amounts of saline to flush away all dirt,debris, and foreign bodies.413 CHAPTER 10 Integumentary System Wound closure, either by sutures, steri strips, or dressings. Dirty wounds are usually left open to heal by secondary intention. Antibiotics if necessary, usually 7 to 10 days. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Impaired tissue integrity Risk of infection Impaired skin integrity NURSING TREATMENT Explain to the patient: Disease process. Signs of infection, i.e., swelling, redness, increase in pain, fever, chills, drainage, bleeding, foul odor, or reopening of wound. Medication, including indication for, frequency of use, and side effects. Demonstrate proper dressing change techniques, including frequency,proper hand washing, cleansing of wound, and application of topicalsif ordered. Adequate nutrition and hydration. Elevation of affected limb, if indicated. Rest, decrease in activities. Proper immunization schedules Crucial Diagnostic Tests Allergy Skin Testing An allergy skin test is used to confirm whether such symptoms as sneezing,wheezing, and skin rashes are caused by allergies. The test is performed byexposing an area of the skin to the extract of an allergen and then evaluating theskin's reaction. A wheal and/or erythema indicate confirmation of the allergy. An414 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified intradermal test, where the allergen is injected just under the skin, or a patch test, where an allergen patch is placed on the skin, may also be used. Before the test\u2014Instruct the patient to withhold antihistamines, steroids, and leuko- triene modulator medications which would interfere with the results of the test.Explain to the patient what to expect. Skin Biopsy A skin biopsy is usually done to diagnose an abnormal area of the skin, such as agrowth or mole for cancer It is also used to diagnose a bacterial or fungal skininfection or other abnormal skin condition. A sample of tissue is taken for analy-sis by a pathologist to determine if cellular changes have occurred. There are sev-eral types of biopsy as follows: Punch biopsy where a small cylindrical fragment of tissue is removed from the affected area, by a sharp cookie-cutter-like tool (punch). Shave biopsy where a superficial piece of skin is removed from the affectedarea with a sharp, sterile blade Excisional biopsy where a larger area of skin is removed, allowing for analy-sis of deeper skin structures or removal of the entire lesion. A local anestheticis typically used. After the test\u2014Monitor the area for healing. Gram Stain Gram stain or Gram's method is a way of differentiating bacterial species into twolarge groups, Gram-positive and Gram-negative based on properties of their cellwalls. A stain is added to a culture on a slide which will show blue for Gram-positive cells or red for Gram-negative cells. This is the first step in determiningthe identity of a particular bacterial sample and can be used to allow empiric anti-biotics to be started, before the final culture is ready. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Culture The test is performed by taking a fluid sample from the lesions within 3 days of appearance. The virus, if present, can be detected in this fluid sample in a few days.415 CHAPTER 10 Integumentary System Blood testing can also be performed to identify antibodies for the particular type of Herpes virus. Potassium Hydroxide Preparation (KOH) This test is done to provide a rapid, differential diagnosis of fungal infections of the hair, skin, or nail. A solution of KOH mixed with a blue-black dye is added toa slide containing cells from the infected tissues, and the slide is viewed under amicroscope. Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) This is a blood test used to screen for an allergy to a specific substance or sub- stances. It measures the amount of IgE antibody that reacts specifically with thesuspected allergen.

Click here for terms of use. 420 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified How Fluids and Electrolytes Work Fluids in the body are found in three basic places: within the cells (intracellular), outside the cells (extracellular), and within the tissue spaces (interstitial space orthird space). A balance should be maintained to keep concentrations of both fluidsand electrolytes in the proper areas for normal function. The cell walls are semi-permeable to allow for movement (diffusion) of molecules. This helps to maintainosmotic pressure. Edema occurs when too much fluid enters the interstitial space. Peripheral edema usually collects in subcutaneous areas. The higher hydrostatic pressure inthe vessel causes fluids to move into the interstitial areas which have lower pres-sure, allowing the fluid to build up. Normal osmolarity of plasma is 270 to 300 mOsm/L. Isotonic or normotonic flu- ids have similar concentrations. This prevents fluids from shifting into spaces theydo not belong. Hypertonic solutions have a concentration greater than 300 mOsm/Land exert a greater pressure, which pulls water from the isotonic area to the hyper- tonic solution in an attempt to equalize the osmolarity. Hypotonic solutions have aKey Terms Acid base alkalosisHypophosphatemiaHyperphosphatemiaDehydration 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13421 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes concentration of less than 270 mOsm/L and exert less pressure, which allows water to be pulled from the hypotonic area into the isotonic area. HORMONAL REGULATION OF FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES Aldosterone is secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to sodium changes. Wheresodium goes, water follows. Aldosterone signals the tubules within the nephronsin the kidneys to reabsorb sodium and therefore water. This increases blood osmo-larity. Aldosterone also aids in control of potassium levels. Renin is secreted by the kidneys in responses to changes in sodium or fluid vol- ume. In the circulation, renin acts on a plasma protein called renin substrate (alsocalled angiotensinogen), converting it to angiotensin I. In pulmonary aldosterone secretion. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is produced in the brain and stored in the poste- rior pituitary. It is released when there is a change in the osmolarity of the blood.ADH acts on the renal tubules, causing them to reabsob more water, which de-creases blood osmolarity. When the osmolarity gets too low, the release of ADH isnot needed and the water is excreted in the urine. Natriuretic peptides are secreted in response to increases in blood volume and blood pressure. When atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide(BNP) are of sodium is inhibited and the glomerular fil-tration rate is increased. Blood osmolarity is decreased and urine output is increased. IV fluids Osmolarity Hypo-, Iso-, ACID BASE BALANCE Maintaining acid-base balance will keep the pH level within the normal range of 7.35 to 7.45. The lungs and the kidneys are integral in maintaining the normalacid-base balance. The body constantly monitors the pH level and makes adjust-ments in an attempt to correct any abnormalities. pHCO 3is regulated by the kid- neys. pCO2is regulated by the lungs. If the patient develops acidosis there will be a low pH and either a drop in pHCO3(metabolic) or a rise in pCO2(respiratory). If the patient develops alkalosis there will be an increase in pH and either anincrease in pHCO 3(metabolic) or a drop in pCO2(respiratory). In an attempt to maintain as normal an internal environment as possible, the body will attempt to compensate for the changes that are occurring. The lungs are able to correctmuch more rapidly than the kidneys. Just the Facts Hyponatremia WHAT WENT WRONG? Hyponatremia is an abnormally low amount of sodium in the blood. Low levels ofsodium may be due to loss of sodium from the body, movement of sodium from theblood to other spaces, or dilution of sodium concentration within the plasma. Somecauses include increased excretion or abnormal excretion of sodium, water imbal-ance, hormonal imbalance (such as excess ADH), ecstasy (methylenedioxymethy-lamphetamine) use, hypothyroidism, renal failure, diuretics, diarrhea, vomiting, and wound drainage. PROGNOSIS Identification and correction of the underlying cause is important in treatment ofhyponatremia. Water restriction of all patients with hyponatremia will help to pre-vent further dilution of the plasma concentration of sodium. Seizure and death mayoccur if the electrolyte imbalance is not identified and corrected. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Hypotension, especially orthostatic (with position changes\u2014from lying tositting) due to decrease in cardiac output in setting of hypovolemia1423 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes Nausea Diarrhea due to increased gastrointestinal motility Increased bowel sounds due to increased gastrointestinal motility Malaise or excessive activity Muscle weakness Decreased deep tendon reflexes Personality changes due to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure Altered level of consciousness Seizure INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS A blood serum sodium level < 135 mEq/L (normal sodium level is 135 to 145 mEq/L). Spot urine for sodium level. TREATMENT Water restriction. Administer saline solution IV if patient has fluid deficit (hypovolemic). Furosemide if fluid-overloaded. Treat underlying cause to correct problem. NURSING DIAGNOSES Deficient fluid volume Excess fluid volume Risk for disturbed thought processes Decreased cardiac output NURSING INTERVENTION Record fluid intake and output to monitor fluid status. Monitor vital signs. Weigh patient daily.424 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor for signs of dehydration: decreased skin turgor (elasticity), dry mucous membranes, decreased sweating, neurologic changes. Appropriate oral hygiene for dry mucous membranes. Proper skin care is especially important if the patient is experiencing diarrheaor dehydration. Explain to the patient fluid restriction and dietary modifications. Increase sodium in diet appropriately, considering comorbidities. Hypernatremia WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypernatremia is an abnormally high amount of sodium in blood. Fluid volumemay be altered as a result of changes in the levels of sodium. A mild rise in sodiumlevels causes tissue that is normally excitable to become more irritable\u2014for exam-ple, cardiac muscle. The osmolarity of extracellular fluid also increases as thesodium level increases. This is in attempt to correct the sodium increase by bring-ing more fluid from the cells into the extracellular area. These dehydrated, moreirritable cells have a decreased ability to respond to stimuli. Causes may include insufficient water intake (patients who are NPO), insuffi- cient sodium excretion due to hormone imbalance, renal failure, corticosteroids,increased sodium intake or increased water loss due to fever, hyperventilation, in-creased metabolism, and dehydration due to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea. PROGNOSIS Identification and correction of the cause is necessary to return the patient to a normal fluid and electrolyte balance. IV fluids are carefully monitored during thistreatment period to avoid overcorrection of the sodium level, causing hyponatremia.If the sodium level is severely elevated, the patient may need hemodialysis. Hyper-volemia associated with hypernatremia in some patients may cause heart failureand pulmonary edema. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Weight gain due to fluid retention Restlessness, irritability, and agitation due to increase in neural activity withnormal or low fluid volume2425 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes Decreased level of consciousness due to decrease in neural activity with hypervolemia Muscle twitching due to irregular muscle contractions Muscle weakness bilaterally Blood pressure increased\u2014compare with normal for patient Decreased myocardial contractility, resulting in less effective pumping actionof heart muscle Distended neck veins in hypervolemic patients Less cardiac output, especially with hypovolemic patients Increased thirst in an attempt to increase fluid intake INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS A blood serum sodium level > 145 mEq/L. Normal sodium is 135 to 145mEq/L. Spot urine for sodium level. TREATMENT Hypotonic IV fluids are typically given to correct hypernatremic patients who arevolume-depleted. Diuretics are also used to help correct the sodium balance. Administer 0.225 percent sodium chloride, 0.33 percent sodium chloride, or0.45 percent sodium chloride to correct fluid and sodium status. Administer diuretics to remove excess fluids and promote sodium loss: furosemide, bumetanide NURSING DIAGNOSES Disturbed thought process Excess fluid volume Deficient fluid volume NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs, check pulse rate and rhythm, check blood pressure, andcompare with prior.426 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Weigh daily and compare. Record fluid intake and output to check balance of fluid. Monitor IV site for patency, signs of infiltration such as redness or induration. Consult with dietician. Explain to the patient: Restrict salt in the diet. Fluid intake restriction. Proper oral hygiene to avoid irritation due to fluid restriction. Hypocalcemia WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypocalcemia is an abnormally low level of calcium in the blood. Decreased levels of calcium may be due to inadequate intake or absorption (vitamin D defi-ciency, malabsorption), excess loss (associated with burns, renal disease, diuretics,or alcoholism), endocrine disorders (such as hypoparathyroidism), decreased serumalbumin, hyperphosphatemia, or sepsis. PROGNOSIS Identification and correction of the cause is necessary to return the patient to a nor-mal fluid and electrolyte balance. As the calcium level becomes more abnormal,the risk to the patient is greater. Seizures and cardiac arrhythmias may develop,which may become life-threatening. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Irritability Paresthesia of lips (circumoral) and extremities Muscle spasm and cramping Tetany\u2014intermittent painful tonic spasms, usually involving the arms and legs Abdominal pain due to muscle cell cramping within the gastrointestinal tract Laryngospasm and stridor (abnormal high-pitched breathing sound) as air-way becomes narrowed3427 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes Seizures due to irritation of nervous system tissue Cardiac arrhythmias due to increased excitation of cardiac muscle cells Prolonged QT interval will predispose to ventricular arrhythmias Contraction of facial muscle after tapping facial nerve anterior to ear (Chvostek's sign) due to increased excitation of nerve and muscle cells Carpal spasm after inflation of blood pressure cuff to upper arm\u2014occludesbrachial artery and applies pressure to nerves (Trousseau's sign) INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Blood serum calcium level of less than 9 mg/dL. TREATMENT Maintain intravenous access. High calcium diet to replenish lost calcium. Administer vitamin D if patient has deficiency; helps with absorption ofcalcium: ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) Administer calcium gluconate 10 percent IV (emergency treatment for seizure,tetany, cardiac arrhythmia). Administer calcium chloride (emergency treatment). NURSING DIAGNOSES Imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires At risk for injury NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor intake and output. Monitor neurologic status for change, irritability, and disorientation. Monitor cardiovascular status for changes, irregularity of heartbeat, pulsedeficit (difference between heartbeat and peripheral pulse checked at thesame time), and cardiac rhythm.428 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor for signs of hypercalcemia when administering medication (can over- medicate with calcium): nausea vomiting anorexia Explain to the patient: Avoid dependence on laxatives\u2014these medications can alter bowel pat-terns, causing altered absorption and excess elimination of calcium andother electrolytes. Avoid dependence or overuse of antacids\u2014these medications cause excessintake of calcium (or other electrolytes, depending on composition). Hypercalcemia WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypercalcemia is an abnormally high amount of calcium in the blood. Excessintake of calcium (such as supplements or antacids) or altered excretion of calcium(such as in patients with renal failure or those taking thiazide diuretics) may causehypercalcemia. Patients may also develop elevated calcium levels with prolongedimmobility, glucocorticoid use, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, lithiumuse, dehydration, or malignancies with metastasis to the bone. PROGNOSIS Correction of the calcium level is necessary to control the signs and symptoms.Correction or management of the underlying disorder is necessary to correct theabnormal calcium level. High calcium levels cause altered excitability of heart, skele-tal, and smooth muscle tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, and nervous tissues. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Increased heart rate initially Bounding peripheral pulses4429 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes Bradycardia later as electrical conduction is slowed Sinus arrest then cardiac arrest due to altered response of cardiac tissue to normal stimuli Shallow respirations due to skeletal muscle weakness Muscle weakness due to changes in neuromuscular response to normal stimuli Cardiac arrhythmias Nausea and vomiting due to decrease in peristaltic activity Constipation due to decrease in peristaltic activity Dehydration Kidney stones form as excess calcium deposits in kidneys; may be excretedin urine INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Blood calcium level of greater than 10.5 mEq/L . Increased calcium level in urine. EKG shows shortened ST segment, widened T-waves . TREATMENT Medications are typically used to reduce calcium levels. When levels are highlyelevated or patients are having life-threatening problems, dialysis may also be uti-lized to reduce calcium levels. Stop all calcium-containing medications (supplements, antacids). Monitor cardiac rhythm. Maintain intravenous access . Administer 0.9 percent normal saline solution to ensure adequate hydrationstatus; sodium aids in urinary excretion of calcium . Administer Loop diuretics to enhance the excretion of calcium: furosemide Administer plicamycin, a calcium binder, calcium Administer calcitonin, phosphorus, bisphosphonates (etidronate, Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective breathing pattern Decreased cardiac output Impaired urinary elimination NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor cardiovascular status for irregularity of heart rhythm, pulse deficit. Monitor intake and output. Assess muscle strength\u2014hand grips, foot pushes bilaterally for strength and equality. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, distention, and pain. Encourage mobilization, assist with ambulation if necessary to decrease boneresorption due to immobility. Assist with range-of-motion exercises. Low-calcium diet to reduce intake. Strain urine for stones. Explain to patient: High calcium foods. Avoid calcium supplements. Avoid calcium-based antacids. Weight-bearing exercise is important to avoid bone resorption. Hypokalemia WHAT WENT WRONG Hypokalemia is a lower-than-normal level of potassium in the blood. A balancebetween the amount of potassium within the cell (intracellular) and outside the cell(extracellular) is necessary. This allows the resting potential of the cell membraneto be maintained. When there are low potassium levels, a greater-than-normal stim-ulus is needed to depolarize the cell membrane. Many cells become more sluggish,especially nerve cells. However, cardiac cells become more excitable. Fluid lossesdue to diuretics or diarrhea, endocrine disorders (such as hyperthyroidism, hyper-5431 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes aldosteronism), insufficient intake of potassium, and low magnesium levels can all contribute to low potassium levels. Dietary intake is the main source of potassium, so patients with poor nutritional intake or prolonged NPO status are also at risk forhypokalemia. PROGNOSIS Low potassium levels may range from minor to life-threatening. The more abnor-mal the level, the greater the chance the patient will develop a cardiac arrhythmia.Correction or management of the underlying cause is necessary to help restore theelectrolyte balance. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Muscle weakness due to need for greater stimulation of cell due to low potas-sium level Muscle cramps Malaise and lethargy Decrease in deep tendon reflex response due to lack of response of nervetissue to normal stimuli Anorexia and constipation due to decrease in peristaltic activity Palpitations due to cardiac arrhythmias caused by excitability of cardiac muscle Rhabdomyolysis (destruction or degeneration of muscle tissue) in severehypokalemia Cardiac arrest in severe hypokalemia INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L. EKG shows development of U-waves, ST depression, premature ventricularcontractions, A V block. TREATMENT Correct fluid imbalance. Stop or change medications that contribute to potassium loss, if possible (forexample, Loop diuretics).432 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Encourage potassium-rich foods. Administer potassium supplements. Administer potassium in intravenous fluids: Avoid glucose in fluid which will shift potassium into cells. Potassium concentration of no more than 40 mEq/L in peripheral lines. Monitor cardiac rhythm. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Activity intolerance Decreased cardiac output Fatigue NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs for change. Monitor cardiac system for rate, rhythm, and pulse deficit. Monitor intake and output. Monitor intravenous site for redness, swelling, warmth, and pain. Teach patient about medication and diet changes: Foods rich in potassium (bananas, tomatoes, orange juice) Hyperkalemia WHAT WENT WRONG Hyperkalemia is an elevated level of potassium in the blood. Dietary intake is the main source of potassium. Patients are at risk for hyperkalemia when there is exces-sive ingestion of potassium-rich foods or salt substitutes, they are on medicationsthat cause potassium retention (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor as amiloride or spironolactone, NSAIDs, tri-methoprim, pentamidine), or there is excess release of potassium from the cells(hemolysis, acidosis, low insulin levels, beta blocker use, digoxin overdose,succinylcholine, or rhabdomyolysis).6433 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes PROGNOSIS As potassium levels rise, the risk of cardiac arrhythmias also increases. An extreme elevation creates a medical emergency. Correction or management of the underly-ing cause is necessary to help restore the electrolyte balance. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Weakness and dizziness due to neuromuscular changes Abdominal distention Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea due to change in membrane potential on GI system Palpitations due to arrhythmias Arrhythmias due to changes in normal cardiac conduction Cardiac arrest INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Potassium level > 5 mEq/L. EKG shows peaked T-waves, widened QRS-waves, ventricular asystole, car-diac arrest. TREATMENT The treatment choices will depend on the severity of the potassium elevation.Decreasing further intake, enhancing renal excretion, and cellular uptake are allgoals of treatment. Monitor cardiac rhythm. Administer intravenous insulin and glucose to move potassium from extra-cellular fluid to intracellular fluid. Administer calcium gluconate intravenously. Administer NaHCO3to move potassium from extracellular fluid to intracel- lular fluid. Administer diuretics to remove potassium from body. Administer kayexalate to remove potassium from body via GI tract. Monitor electrolyte levels.434 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Restrict potassium intake. Dialysis for severe elevations. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Decreased cardiac output Risk for imbalanced fluid volume Activity intolerance Altered bowel elimination NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs. Monitor cardiac rhythm. Monitor cardiovascular status for regularity of rhythm, rate, heart sounds, and peripheral pulses. Monitor abdomen for bowel sounds, distention, and pain. Monitor intravenous site for redness, swelling, and pain. Teach patient about medications and diet: Avoid foods that are high in potassium. Avoid salt substitutes (most are potassium-based). Hypomagnesemia WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypomagnesemia is a lower-than-normal magnesium level in the blood. Low serumlevels of magnesium can be due to lack of sufficient intake or absorption (malnutri-tion, vomiting, diarrhea, celiac disease, Crohn's disease), excess excretion of mag-nesium (renal loss, chronic alcohol intake, diuretic antibiotics,antineoplastics), or intracellular movement of administration). membranes become more excitable in the setting oflow magnesium levels. Patients may also have associated imbalances of potassiumand calcium.7435 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes PROGNOSIS Correction of the magnesium level is necessary to return normal electrolyte bal- ance to the patient. Correction or management of the underlying condition may benecessary to correct the magnesium level. Nerve impulse transmission is increasedin patients with hypomagnesemia. As the magnesium level drops, the patient maydevelop seizures or cardiac arrhythmias. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Painful paresthesia (numbness and tingling) Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes\u2014using a reflex hammer, strike tendon at specific site to elicit response (patellar tendon, Achilles tendon, brachio-radialis, bicep, or tricep) Muscle twitching Seizures due to irritability of nervous tissue in brain Confusion due to Central Nervous System (CNS) irritability Headaches Mood changes or irritability Decreased appetite, nausea, and constipation due to decreased gastrointestinalmotility Decreased bowel sounds and abdominal distention Arrhythmia, ectopic beats, ventricular arrhythmias Contraction of facial muscle after tapping facial nerve anterior to ear(Chvostek's sign) due to increased excitation of nerve and muscle cells ifconcurrent hypocalcemia Carpal spasm after inflation of blood pressure cuff to upper arm\u2014occludesbrachial artery and applies pressure to nerves (Trousseau's sign) if concurrenthypocalcemia INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Blood serum magnesium level < 1.5 mEq/L. EKG shows depressed ST segments, tall T-waves.436 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Administer magnesium sulfate intravenously to increase levels. Monitor deep tendon reflexes. Monitor cardiac rhythm. Increase magnesium in the patient's diet. May need to correct calcium and potassium concurrently. NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Risk for injury Decreased cardiac output NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output. Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor cardiovascular status for changes in heart rhythm, pulse deficit. Explain to the patient: Eat whole grains, legumes, fish, and dark green leafy vegetables that are high in magnesium. No laxatives. Hypermagnesemia WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypermagnesemia is a greater-than-normal amount of magnesium in the blood.Patients with poor renal function or long-term abuse of magnesium-containingcompounds have difficulty excreting magnesium. The excess of magnesium in theblood causes the cell membranes to become less excitable than normal, requiringa greater stimuli than would normally be needed to cause a required effect. As themagnesium level continues to rise, the cell membrane becomes more resistant toits natural stimuli.8437 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes PROGNOSIS Correction of the magnesium level is necessary to prevent life-threatening com- plications. Patients are at significant risk for cardiac arrest as the magnesium lev-els continue to rise. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Bradycardia due to slowed cellular response to normal stimuli Hypotension due to vasodilation Drowsiness or lethargy Weakness Less-than-normal deep tendon reflexes Confusion Urinary retention Cardiac arrest when level severely elevated INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Blood serum magnesium levels > 2.5 mEq/L. EKG shows widened QRS complex, prolonged PR intervals. BUN elevation if there is renal insufficiency. TREATMENT Administer magnesium antagonist intravenously: Dialysis\u2014hemodialysis or peritoneal, to remove excess magnesium (espe-cially in patients with renal failure). Reduce magnesium in diet (avoid meat, legumes, dark green leafy vegetables,fish, whole grains, nuts). Increase fluid intake to maintain hydration.438 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired gas exchange Risk for injury Reduced cardiac output NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output. Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor cardiovascular status for changes in heart rate, rhythm. Monitor labs for electrolyte balance. Explain to the patient: Avoid foods high in magnesium. Avoid magnesium-based medications. Metabolic Acidosis WHAT WENT WRONG? The acid-base balance of the blood is thrown off, causing it to become more acidic. There is an arterial pH of less than 7.35. There may be an overproductionof hydrogen ions (lactic acidosis in fever or seizures, diabetic ketoacidosis, star-vation, alcohol or aspirin intake), deficient elimination of hydrogen ions (renalfailure), deficient production of bicarbonate ions (renal failure, pancreatic insuffi-ciency), or excess elimination of bicarbonate ions (diarrhea). PROGNOSIS Correction or management of the underlying cause is necessary to help restore theacid-base balance. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Lethargy due to increased hydrogen ion concentration in blood Muscle weakness bilaterally due to neuromuscular manifestations9439 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes Tachycardia early in acidosis; later, cardiac electrical conduction slows, caus- ing bradycardia and increasing risk for heart block or arrhythmia Hypotension due to vasodilation Rapid, deep breathing (hyperventilation) as body attempts to compensate INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Arterial blood gas showing pH < 7.35 and bicarbonate < 22 mEq/L, normalPaCO 2. Ketones in urine possible. Potassium level elevated. Chloride level normal or elevated. TREATMENT Administer intravenous fluids for hydration as necessary. Monitor arterial blood gas levels. Administer supplemental oxygen as necessary. Administer bicarbonate if bicarbonate levels are low. Correct the underlying condition that is causing the imbalance. Administer insulin and fluids in diabetic ketoacidosis. Mechanical ventilation if necessary. Hemodialysis if necessary to restore normal balance in system or removeoffending substance. NURSING DIAGNOSES Disturbed thought processes Ineffective breathing pattern NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output. Monitor vital signs for changes.440 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor lab test results. Monitor ABG results. Metabolic Alkalosis WHAT WENT WRONG? The acid-base balance of the blood is basic because of either a decrease in acidity or an increase in bicarbonate. Alkalosis is often associated with decreased levels ofpotassium or calcium. Metabolic alkalosis may be due to excess intake of antacids,blood transfusions, long-term parenteral nutrition, prolonged vomiting or nasogas-tric suctioning, Cushing's disease, use of thiazide diuretics, or excess aldosterone. PROGNOSIS Correction or management of the underlying cause is necessary to help restore theacid-base balance. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Muscle weakness due to neuromuscular changes and hypokalemia Muscle cramping and twitching due to electrolyte changes Anxiety and irritability Tetany and seizures, as alkalosis worsens Positive Chvostek's sign due to hypocalcemia Positive Trousseau's sign due to hypocalcemia Increased reflexes due to neuromuscular irritability Increased heart rate and myocardial irritability INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Arterial blood gas showing pH > 7.45, bicarbonate > 28 mEq/L, pCO2 elevated. Serum potassium low, chloride low.10441 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes TREATMENT Monitor arterial blood gases and electrolyte levels. Administer fluids and electrolytes as necessary. Administer supplemental oxygen if necessary. Administer electrolyte replacement as indicated. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for injury Disturbed thought process NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor cardiovascular status for changes in heart rate, rhythm. Monitor intake and output. Assess intravenous site for signs of infiltration. Check neurological status for changes. Hypophosphatemia WHAT WENT WRONG? Hypophosphatemia is a lower-than-normal amount of phosphorus in the blood. Chronic alcohol use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma medications(loop diuretics, corticosteroids, adrenergic agonists, xanthine derivatives) are asso-ciated with low phosphate levels. Vitamin D is important in the intestinal absorp-tion of phosphate. Parathyroid hormone stimulates the release of phosphate fromthe bone tissue. An overproduction can lead to hypophosphatemia. PROGNOSIS Correction or management of the underlying cause is necessary to help restore theelectrolyte balance. Proper treatment cannot be given without identification ofthe underlying cause.11442 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Muscle weakness due to impairment in oxygen delivery to the tissues Rhabdomyolysis with breakdown of muscle tissue Paresthesia (tingling sensations) Hemolytic anemia due to fragility of red blood cells Encephalopathy (irritability, confusion, disorientation, seizures, coma) Respiratory failure or trouble weaning from ventilator due to changes in oxy- gen delivery to cells Weakening of bone structure seen in chronic, severe hypophosphatemia dueto phosphate leaving bones Petechiae due to poorly functioning platelets INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Phosphorus < 1.7 mEq/L in blood serum. Spot urine sampling for diminished phosphate. Parathyroid (PTH) levels elevated. In anemia, low hemoglobin and hematocrit. Elevated creatine kinase in rhabdomyolysis. TREATMENT Administer potassium phosphate to replace phosphate: Oral for mild to moderate loss, or intravenous for severe loss. Monitor for hypotension if intravenous replacement of phosphate. Monitor serum phosphate, calcium, potassium, and magnesium levels every6 to 8 hours during initial replacement. Diet high in phosphorus for chronic hypophosphatemia. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for injury Imbalanced nutrition443 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output. Monitor vital signs; may see hypotension with intravenous phosphate infusion. Explain to the patient: Diet of turkey, skim milk and milk products, and dried fruits. Hyperphosphatemia WHAT WENT WRONG? Hyperphosphatemia is a higher-than-normal amount of phosphorus in the blood. Patients may develop increased phosphate levels as a result of renal insufficiency,increase in phosphorus intake (supplements, laxatives, enemas, excess vitamin D),hypoparathyroidism, rhabdomyolysis, or as a result of cell destruction from chemo-therapy. As phosphate levels increase, calcium levels decrease. PROGNOSIS Correction or management of the underlying cause is necessary to help restore theelectrolyte balance. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic Symptoms of underlying disorder, such as renal disease May see symptoms of coexisting electrolyte disorders, such as hypocalcemia INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Phosphorus > 4.6 mEq/L in blood serum.12444 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENT Administer medications orally in divided doses during the day to bind phosphate: calcium acetate aluminum hydroxide lanthanum Dialysis to remove excess phosphate. Diet low in phosphorus to avoid excess intake. Monitor labs for correction of electrolytes. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for injury Imbalanced nutrition NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor intake and output. Monitor vital signs. Explain to the patient: No over-the-counter medications (i.e. laxatives) that contain phosphorusto avoid recurrence. Medication use and schedule. Dehydration WHAT WENT WRONG? A state of having less-than-normal body fluids, due to an excess loss of fluids oran inadequate intake of fluids. Dehydration may be actual or relative. A relativedehydration exists when the amount of fluid and electrolytes in the body is cor-rect, but the placement is not correct. If fluid shifting has occurred and the fluidis now in the interstitial areas rather than in the circulating blood volume, thepatient may actually be experiencing a relative dehydration. Even though there is13445 CHAPTER 11 Fluids and Electrolytes adequate fluid within the body, it cannot be utilized at this time. More commonly, dehydration is actual and due to loss of fluid from the body or lack of adequatehydration. PROGNOSIS Adequate replacement of fluids with the appropriate fluid type is essential to ensureadequate circulating blood volume. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Thirst as the body wants more fluids Poor skin turgor due to fluid loss Tachycardia\u2014heart rate increases to circulate remaining volume faster Tachypnea\u2014respiratory rate increases in an attempt to obtain more oxygen Decreased urinary output\u2014less volume available to leave the body Increased BUN as volume depletes Hypotension due to decrease in circulating blood volume INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS BUN elevated. Elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit as blood hemoconcentrates. TREATMENT Intravenous and oral fluid replacement. Monitor serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, urine electrolytes. Monitor cardiac rhythm if there is an electrolyte disturbance. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Deficient fluid volume Risk for impaired urinary elimination Impaired oral mucous membrane446 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs; check for orthostatic hypotension. Monitor intake and output. Assess intravenous access site for signs of redness, swelling, or pain. Assess skin and mucous membranes for dryness. Assess cardiovascular status\u2014heart rate, heart sounds, peripheral pulses. Assess respiratory status\u2014lung sounds, respiratory rate. Encourage oral fluid intake. Increase frequency of mouth care. Crucial Diagnostic Tests Blood Tests Blood is removed from the patient and sent to the lab.

Click here for terms of use. 452 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified A Look at Mental Health Alterations in mental health can be more difficult to diagnose because there is no definitive laboratory test or radiological study with which to isolate the disorder.Patients may initially seek treatment from primary care practitioners for a varietyof complaints: anxiety, insomnia, generalized aches, or other somatic complaints. A thorough patient history should include past medical conditions, any prior mental health conditions and their treatment course, current medications, socialhistory (including habits, work, exercise, and substance use), cultural background,environmental factors, family history, and changes in libido, appetite, or sleep.Physical examination focuses on the chief complaint from the patient's pointof view and traces the progression of symptoms in a chronological order fromthe time of onset. Mental status examination is completed focusing on the patient'sappearance, activity and behavior, affect, mood, speech, content of thought, thoughtprocess, cognition, judgment, and insight.Key 2 3 45 6 7 8Learning Objectives453 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health The majority of patients are cared for on an outpatient basis. Hospitalization should be considered for those who: Are too sick to care for themselves. Present a serious threat to themselves or to others. Neglect to care for themselves. Are violent or have bizarre behavior. Have suicidal ideation. Have paranoid ideation. Have delusions. Have a marked impairment in judgment. Patients with a coexisting mental health disorder are also admitted to a medical surgical floor only if the medical condition warrants medical management. Caring for the patient admitted with a medical or surgical condition does not preclude theneed to care for the patient's depression or schizophrenia as well. Patients may alsodevelop medical conditions as a result of their mental health issues. Patients withinadequate nutritional intake due to an eating disorder may have significant elec-trolyte imbalances or cardiac dysfunction. Just the Facts Anxiety WHAT WENT WRONG? Patients exhibit symptoms when an imbalance develops between the number ofopen receptor sites and the number of available neurotransmitters. Neurotransmittersare released from one side of a synapse and land on a specific receptor site acrossthe synapse. A second mechanism exists (a reuptake mechanism) to remove excessneurotransmitters left within the space between where they are released and wherethey fill the receptor sites. When there are insufficient neurotransmitters availableto fill the open neurotransmitter receptor sites, the patient develops symptoms.Patients experience an uncontrollable feeling of anxiousness which is present more days than not. Symptom onset is typically in late teens through early thirties. Anxiety is more common in women and in patients with a family history of anxiety.1454 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Without proper treatment the anxiety will continue, and symptoms may even progress. The patient's quality of life is adversely affected. Social functioning be-comes impaired and in some cases the patient becomes more socially isolated.Physical symptoms continue, at times necessitating visits to a primary care provideror even the emergency room. With proper treatment, the symptoms are controlled,neurotransmitter balance is restored, and remission is achieved. The symptoms willtypically recur at a later point, even when properly treated. It may be months oryears after a successful course of treatment before the symptoms recur. The treat-ment that was effective in the past will typically be effective again in the future. Alonger treatment course is recommended for subsequent treatment cycles whenusing SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Fear, tension, apprehension due to alteration in neurotransmission Persistent worry Trouble concentrating Irritability and restlessness Tachycardia, palpitations, elevated blood pressure due to autonomic nervoussystem stimulation Hyperventilation due to fear, elevated heart rate, and palpitations Sweating, tremors due to autonomic nervous system stimulation Sleep disturbance and fatigue due to alteration in neurotransmission Headache due to nervous system irritability and lack of sleep INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Normal lab results TREATMENT Administer anxiolytics for acute management: alprazolam, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam455 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health Monitor for respiratory depression or decrease in blood pressure. Have benzodiazepine antagonist (flumazenil) on hand to reverse effect if needed. beta-blockers for symptom Psychotherapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy. Relaxation techniques such as biofeedback. Desensitization\u2014repeated exposures to graded doses of the object or situa-tion that produces the anxiety. Group therapy. Family therapy. Emotive therapy. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Sleep pattern disturbance Anxiety Fear Impaired social interaction Ineffective role performance NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor medication intake. Discuss patient response to therapy. Monitor vital signs, watch for elevation in blood pressure with somemedications.456 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor weight; some medications are associated with changes in weight. Monitor sleep; ask patient about restful sleep during the night or difficulty falling asleep. Teach patient to avoid alcohol intake with benzodiazepine use. Panic Disorder WHAT WENT WRONG? Patients experience intermittent episodes that have a sudden onset and no pre-dictable pattern, causing intense anxiety associated with pronounced physical symp-toms. These episodes are short in duration and recurrent in nature. The disorder tends to present before the age of 25, is twice as common in women as it is in men,and tends to be familial. Some patients will choose to self-medicate with alcoholin an attempt to escape the disease, diminish symptoms, or decrease the occur-rence of the episodes. Others become dependent on tranquilizing medications.Panic attacks can impede a person's life and restrict activity, especially in antici-pation of a panic attack. PROGNOSIS With proper treatment, the frequency and intensity of the episodes will decrease.Some patients may not experience complete resolution of symptoms, even withappropriate medications. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Depersonalization, as if the symptoms are happening to someone else Sense of doom, fear of dying due to the intensity of the physical symptoms Fear of losing control due to the unpredictable nature of the episodes Worry about future attacks due to the unpredictable nature of the episodes Change in behavior due to anxiety about being in a place where an attackmight occur2457 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health Palpitations, tachycardia, and chest pain Dyspnea Choking sensation Nausea Dizziness Diaphoresis Numbness INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS EKG normal. Cardiac monitor normal. Lab results normal. Pulse oximetry normal. TREATMENT Cognitive-behavioral therapy. Relaxation therapy. Administer antidepressants: Powerlessness Fear Social isolation458 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTION Provide reassurance to patient. Reduce anxiety. Monitor vital signs. Depression Patients with depression have a persistent sense of sadness, more days than not, often associated with somatic complaints. The medical work-ups for variedphysical complaints will be negative. Patients typically have a loss of interest innormal activities and alterations in sleep and eating habits. Up to one-third ofpatients will seek care from primary care providers. Patients can also present asunkempt, dirty, withdrawn, and unwilling to engage in conversation. They seelife as a state of hopelessness. The patient's depression must be treated seriously,since it can lead to suicide. A patient's request for help might be his or her lastrecourse. WHAT WENT WRONG? Several different theories exist involving the cause of depression. Genetic factorsmay lead to changes in the normal functioning of neurotransmitters. Neurotrans-mitters are released from one side of a synapse and land on a specific receptor site on the other side of the synapse. When a balance is maintained between theamount released and the amount needed to fill the receptor sites, normal functioncontinues. When there is an imbalance, the neurotransmission is altered. Develop-mental factors can often be traced back to childhood. Personality disorders maybegin during school age or adolescence. Psychosocial stressors are another factorlinked to the development of depression. Major life changes such as the death ofa family member, unemployment, or moving away from family and friends maylead to the onset of depression. A sense of sadness or grief is considered a normalresponse to this type of loss and should resolve as the person progresses throughthe normal stages of grieving. Depression, however, is not a normal response to loss.A grieving person will have a sustained sense of self-esteem, whereas a personwith depression will have a sense of worthlessness.3459 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health PROGNOSIS Proper treatment can help control the symptoms of depression. Adequate treatment can cause remission of symptoms. It is not unusual for there to be a recurrence ofsymptoms at some point in the future, even with appropriate treatment. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Intense feeling of sadness Depressed mood Anhedonia (loss of interest in usual activities) Hopelessness or worthlessness Difficulty concentrating Indecision Changes in sleep (more or less than usual), eating (more or less than usual),and activity (more or less than usual) Social withdrawal and isolation Decreased libido Thoughts of death Physical complaints include headache, malaise, decreased libido, and changesin sleep, activity, and eating INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Diagnostic testing results normal, unless co-existing disease present. TREATMENT Ask patient about suicidal thoughts. Ask patient about suicidal plan. Psychotherapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy. Support in refractory cases. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Hopelessness Risk for suicide Dysfunctional grieving Impaired social interaction Social isolation Disturbed self-esteem NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor patient frequently when first admitted. One-to-one observation if patient is a suicidal risk. Develop a level of sensitivity and trust with the patient. Ask patient about suicidal ideation; do they have a plan, have they attempted to carry out a plan. Monitor medication intake. Discuss patient response to therapy. Monitor vital signs; watch for elevation in blood pressure with some med-ications. Monitor weight; some medications are associated with changes in weight. Monitor sleep; ask patient about restful sleep during the night, and difficultyfalling asleep.461 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health Bipolar Disorder Patients suffering from mood disorders often have difficulty with interpersonal interactions. Substance abuse occurs as patients attempt to self-medicate. WHAT WENT WRONG? Some patients experience episodes of depression alternating with episodes of maniaor hypomania. These episodes may occur in a mixed or cyclic manner. There tendsto be a high comorbidity with substance abuse in these patients. Depressiveepisodes tend to last longer than the manic episodes. During mania the patients areoverenthusiastic, elated, hyperactive, and often engage in activities that they laterregret. Others may be drawn to the patient during manic episodes due to their out-going, engaging behavior. Later the patient's behavior tends to alienate due tomood swings, irritability, aggression, and grandiosity. There is a positive correla-tion between creative behavior and mood disorders. During the manic phase, thepatient has grandiose ideas. PROGNOSIS Proper medication management is necessary to control the symptoms of bipolardisorder. Initial diagnosis and treatment of depression without recognition of thecoexisting mania can lead to the onset of mania due to the antidepressant treat-ment. It is important to treat both components of the disorder to effectively man-age the patient. Ongoing treatment is often necessary to prevent the patient fromcycling into another manic or depressive episode. Some patients may have psy-chotic symptoms as part of the disease process. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Elation Hyperactivity Increased irritability Flight of ideas Grandiosity4462 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Diminished need for sleep Rapid speech Easily distracted Excessive spending Hypersexuality Episodes of depression The patient may stray from medication regimen because he or she feel weighed down INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Lab results normal. TREATMENT Mood stabilizers: NURSING DIAGNOSIS Powerlessness Social isolation463 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health Risk for loneliness Altered sexuality patterns NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor patient frequently when first admitted. Ask about suicidal ideation. Monitor medication intake. Discuss patient response to therapy. Schizophrenia WHAT WENT WRONG? The exact cause of schizophrenia is not known. There is a familial tendency to the disease, and genes have been identified that are associated with the disease.Dysfunction of the neurotransmitter dopamine seems to be partially responsiblefor the development of the symptoms of psychosis associated with schizophrenia.NMDA receptors may also be involved in the disease. PROGNOSIS Patients with schizophrenia typically need long-term medication to control symp-toms. Medication compliance can be difficult for some patients, whether due toaccessibility of medications, side effects, symptoms of disease, or desire not to takedaily medication. Symptom recurrence is likely. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Impairment in reality testing Flat affect Disorganized speech Disorganized thought process Unusual behavior5464 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Delusions Auditory hallucinations INTERPRETING TEST therapy. Structured environment. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Impaired environmental interpretation syndrome Disturbed thought process Disturbed auditory sensory perception NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor medication intake. Discuss patient response to therapy. Discuss importance of medication compliance.465 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health Anorexia Nervosa Anorexia nervosa is a disease process that exists within the developed world, where access to adequate amounts of nutritious food is not an issue. An unrealis-tic expectation of body size may be part of the process, due to society's expecta-tions as depicted in the media. There is an alteration of normal eating behaviors,resulting in a refusal to maintain body weight at or above that which is minimallyexpected. WHAT WENT WRONG? Patients have a fear of gaining weight, even though they appear underweight tothose around them. Patients may restrict the intake of calories or binge and purgeto rid the body of the calories consumed. Anorexia affects females much more fre-quently than males, with onset typically in the teen or preteen years. The patienthas an altered perception of body image. PROGNOSIS There is an increased mortality rate for patients with untreated anorexia nervosa.The majority of these patients succumb to cardiovascular or renal problems. Patientsmay need to be treated periodically for electrolyte disturbances, cardiac rhythmdisturbances, or renal dysfunction. The medical management of the patient needsto be incorporated with the cognitive behavioral therapy to best meet the needs ofthe patient. The symptoms of disease may recur. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Disturbance in self-perception of body shape Refusal to maintain minimal normal body weight Abnormalities in eating behaviors Electrolyte imbalances due to nutritional deficiency Amenorrhea (absence of menstrual flow) or oligomenorrhea (very light men-strual flow) due to lack of body fat Dental caries or periodontitis due to nutritional deficiency6466 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Temporal wasting, visible ribs, and other bony prominences due to lack of body fat Cardiovascular abnormalities due to electrolyte disturbance Gastrointestinal abnormalities due to nutritional deficiency Dizziness due to lack of calorie intake Bradycardia (heart rate below 60 beats per minute) Hypotension (low blood pressure) INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CBC\u2014may see anemia of chronic disease if iron, B12and folate levels are not sufficient to keep up with RBC production. Electrolytes\u2014abnormalities of Na (sodium), K (potassium), Cl (chloride),and CO 2(carbon dioxide). Calcium\u2014abnormality as stores are depleted and intake is insufficient.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy. Family therapy. Antidepressant medications\u2014selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Medical management of electrolyte imbalance\u2014replacement as needed.467 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health Monitor cardiac rhythm for rate and presence of arrhythmia. Calorie replacement; monitor for problems with initial refeeding. Monitor vital signs. Monitor weight. Monitor fluid and calorie intake. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Disturbed body image Imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Altered dentition NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Monitor calorie intake. Monitor cardiac rate and rhythm. Monitor lab results; report abnormalities. Bulimia Nervosa The ideal body type depicted in the media has affected the perception of body image of many adolescents and young adults. Some of them may have an associ-ated biologic vulnerability that makes this societal pressure more pronounced.Peer issues or family problems may compound this, setting the stage for develop-ment of symptoms. WHAT WENT WRONG? Patients have recurrent episodes in which they eat a much larger quantity of foodthan would be expected within a given time frame; this is accompanied by a lack7468 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified of control over eating, followed by some compensatory mechanism to prevent weight gain. This compensatory mechanism may include self-induced vomiting,excessive exercise, laxative use, diuretic use, enema use, or fasting. While eatingdisorders overall are much more common in women, males are more likely to havebulimia than anorexia. PROGNOSIS Patients may need to be treated periodically for electrolyte disturbances, cardiacrhythm disturbances, or renal dysfunction. The medical management of the patientneeds to be incorporated with the cognitive behavioral therapy to best meet the needsof the patient. The symptoms of disease may recur. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Repeated binge eating followed by compensatory behavior (vomiting, exces-sive exercise, laxative use, fasting) Electrolyte imbalances Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea due to loss of body fat Cardiovascular disturbance Erosion of enamel on back of teeth due to repetitive vomiting Callus formation on knuckles from self-induced vomiting Gastrointestinal disturbances due to repetitive purging INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Electrolytes\u2014abnormalities of Na (sodium), K (potassium), Cl (chloride),and CO 2(carbon dioxide).

Phosphorus\u2014abnormality as stores are depleted and intake is insufficient. BUN (blood urea nitrogen) elevated if fluid depleted. Elevated amylase and normal lipase if vomiting.469 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health TREATMENT Psychotherapy: Interpersonal therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy. Family therapy. Medical management of electrolyte imbalance\u2014replacement as needed. Monitor cardiac rhythm for rate and presence of arrhythmia. Monitor vital signs. Monitor weight. Monitor fluid and calorie intake. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Disturbed body image Imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Altered dentition NURSING INTERVENTION Monitor vital signs. Monitor calorie intake. Monitor cardiac rate and rhythm. Monitor lab results; report abnormalities. Delirium WHAT WENT WRONG? Patients exhibit a global disturbance in cognitive functions that may develop rap- idly, sometimes within hours. Symptom severity may vary during the course of theday, depending on cause of symptoms. The patient with a sudden onset of disori-entation and behavioral changes, especially the elderly patient, is often sent for apsychiatric evaluation.8470 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Delirium is often due to an underlying infection, ischemic change, or metabolic disturbance. Rapid identification and intervention for the underlying cause is essen-tial for the patient. Without proper treatment the cause may prove to be fatal. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Confusion Disorientation Behavioral changes Inappropriate words or dress Agitation INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS EEG shows generalized slowing. WBC elevated in bacterial infection. Glucose abnormalities in hyper- or hypoglycemia. EKG abnormalities in myocardial ischemia or infarction. CT scan of brain shows ischemic changes. Electrolyte abnormalities if causative. TREATMENT Monitor vital signs. Monitor neurologic status, orientation, level of consciousness, eye opening,and pupil response. Treatment of underlying cause. Supplemental oxygen delivery if hypoxic. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Risk for falls471 CHAPTER 12 Mental Health NURSING INTERVENTION Protect patient from injury. Monitor intravenous site for signs of infiltration. Perform neurological checks. Quiz 1. Alex is a 78-year-old married man with sudden onset of confusion and dis- orientation.

The surgical procedure may be a sudden, unexpected event forthe patient, resulting in stress and anxiety, such as necessary surgery followingtrauma, or may be something that the patient has planned, such as a liposuction, farin advance. The more time the patient has to prepare for surgery, both physicallyand emotionally, the better able the patient is to cope with the physiological stressesof the surgery. Nurses are in a position to care for the patient, provide necessaryeducation, act as patient advocate, and encourage health promotion behaviors. Surgical Classifications The American Society of Anesthesiology categorizes surgical procedures based onthe degree of risk to the patient. The urgency, location, extent, and reason for theprocedure are all considered, as well as the patient's age; preexisting cardiovascular,1Key Terms 6 7 8Learning Objectives477 CHAPTER 13 Perioperative Care respiratory, findings; abnormal vital signs; andpresence of infection. The risks of doing the surgery are weighed against the risks ofnot doing the surgery. There are some cases in which the risk of surgery is very high,but the patient may certainly die if the surgery is not performed (patients with uncon-trolled internal bleeding following a gunshot or stabbing, for example). The anatomical location of the surgery will affect the degree of risk to the patient. Surgical procedures performed within the thoracic cavity or skull are a greater riskto the patient than procedures performed on the extremities. Surgical proceduresinvolving vital organs such as the heart, lungs, or brain carry a higher risk. The pro-cedures that involve a greater potential for blood loss, such as vascular surgery, alsoinvolve greater risk. The degree of urgency of the procedure is described as emergent, urgent, or elec- tive. Emergent procedures need to be performed immediately after identifying theneed for surgery. Examples include surgery to stop bleeding from trauma, shooting,or stabbing, or a dissecting aortic aneurysm. Urgent procedures are scheduled afterthe determination of surgical need is made. Examples include tumor removal andremoval of kidney stones. Elective procedures are scheduled in advance at a timethat is convenient for both patient and surgeon. Postponement of the surgery forseveral weeks or even months will not cause harm to the patient. Examples includejoint replacement procedures and cosmetic procedures. Theextent of the surgery will affect the risk to the patient. The more extensive the surgical procedure, the greater the potential risk to the patient. More exten-sive sur gical procedures cause more physical insult to the body and typically require a longer duration of anesthesia. The anesthesia can also cause stress to the patient'ssystem, interact with medications in the patient's system, and must be metabolizedout of the body. Thereason for surgery is another way that surgical procedures are classified. The purpose may be diagnostic, curative, restorative, palliative, or cosmetic. Diagnosticprocedures are performed to obtain a biopsy for definitive diagnosis of a mass.Curative procedures are performed to remove a diseased area, such as a lumpec-tomy for breast cancer or an appendectomy. Restorative procedures are performedto restore function, such as joint replacements. Palliative procedures are proce-dures are performed primarily for comfort measures, such as tumor debulking.Cosmetic procedures are typically performed at the patient's request; at timessome cosmetic procedures may fall into restorative (repairing damage or a con-genital defect), curative, or diagnostic (in the setting of skin cancer). The perioperative period can be broken down into the preoperative (time before the surgery), intraoperative (time during the surgery), and the postoperative (time following the surgery until recovery) periods.478 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified The Preoperative Period The preoperative period, the time prior to surgery, is used to prepare the patient for surgery both physically and psychologically. Ideally there is time to correct as manyabnormalities as possible prior to the surgical procedure. For patients having ascheduled procedure with a significant anticipated blood loss, this is the time todonate blood to be banked for use in their surgery and begin to take iron, folic acid,vitamin B 12, and vitamin C to aid in red blood cell production. Preoperative clear- ance is given, informed consent is obtained, and preoperative teaching occurs dur-ing this time. PREOPERATIVE CLEARANCE The patient's primary care provider typically gives preoperative clearance for sur-gery. This physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant is familiar withthe patient's medical history and current medications and is able to adequatelyassess the impending risk of the surgery to the patient. Things to consider whenproviding clearance for the patient include the type of surgical intervention planned,the potential for blood loss during surgery, the patient's age, general health and comorbidities, past medical and surgical history, current medications, use ofherbal remedies or supplements, alcohol use, smoking history, substance use,allergies, family history including problems with surgery, and diagnostic testingresults. Diagnostic studies often include a CBC (to identify anemia or signs ofinfection), a chemistry panel (to identify electrolyte imbalance, abnormal glu-cose, liver or renal function), a urinalysis (to identify infection, protein, glucose),PT/INR/PTT (to identify blood clotting disorders), an EKG (to identify abnormalcardiac rhythms or damage to myocardium), chest x-ray (to identify pulmonarypathology or enlargement of cardiac silhouette), or pulmonary function testing(for patients with respiratory disorders such as asthma or emphysema). CT scans,MRIs, PET scans, or stress testing may be ordered for individual patients depend-ing on their medical history, type of surgical procedure planned, and results of other diagnostic studies. INFORMED CONSENT An informed consent is obtained prior to any invasive or dangerous procedure.The reason for the surgery, type and extent of surgery to be performed, the risks ofthe procedure, the person to perform the procedure, alternative options and their2479 CHAPTER 13 Perioperative Care associated risks, and the risks associated with anesthesia are all explained to the patient. It is the surgeon's responsibility to make sure this information is explainedto the patient. The patient must be a competent adult in order for his or her signa-ture to be valid. If the patient has been given medications that alter his or her abil-ity to reason or to make judgments, the consent will not be valid. The nurse witnessesthe patient's signature on the consent form. PREOPERATIVE TEACHING Explaining normal preoperative routines to the patient can be very helpful, so thepatient knows what to expect. The nurse needs to be familiar with the types ofsurgical procedures and what the expected postoperative course will entail. Theextent of the procedure, type of incision, presence of any tubes or drains, and antic-ipated pain level after the surgery will help guide the type of teaching necessaryfor the patient. Preoperatively the patient can expect to be NPO, or not allowed to eat or drink anything for several hours prior to the procedure. The time frame will depend onthe extent and location of procedure, the type of anesthesia, and the scheduled timeof surgery. An exception to this nothing-by-mouth rule would be for patients whoneed to take oral medications the morning of surgery. Cardiovascular, diabetic, andcertain other medications may need to be taken even though the patient is not toeat or drink anything else. An intravenous access site will be obtained prior to the surgery. Fluids can be administered to the patient in this way. The access also allows for giving the patientmedications intravenously for rapid action. Fluids are routinely given in the oper-ating room and in the immediate recovery period. The patient may have continuedintravenous fluids for more extensive procedures. Skin preparation may only involve washing of the surgical site in the operating room with an antimicrobial solution. Other patients may need to have removal ofhair from the surgical site. This may be with a razor or a depilatory agent. It isimportant not to cut the skin if you are shaving a surgical site; small cuts or abra-sions on the skin allow for potential sites of infection. Depilatory agents can becaustic on the skin of some patients, causing irritation or a rash. A small spot testaway from the surgical area is a good idea in a patient with known skin sensitiv-ity or history of allergies. For patients having planned surgery involving the intestinal tract, a bowel preparation will be completed prior to the surgery. This is done to decrease the bac-terial count within the intestinal tract. Cleansing of the bowel is also completed toempty the intestine of stool before the surgeon plans on cutting into either the smallor large intestine. Both of these preparations help to reduce the possibility of480 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified infection in the postoperative period. For patients who will have tubes or drains in place in the postoperative period, a simple explanation of what to expect can helpto alleviate some anxiety. Availability of pain medication in the postoperative period should be explained to the patient. In many instances the patient is able to manage his or her own painmedication. For outpatient procedures, patients may be given a prescription for anoral pain medication prior to the procedure. This way the medication is availablewhen the patient gets home from the surgery. For postoperative patients in thehospital, many patients have an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia, knownas PCA, for pain management, where pain medication is delivered via a pump.Typically a small basal dose of narcotic is delivered all the time. These patientsalso have the ability to press a button whenever they are experiencing pain. Thepump will monitor the amount and timing of each dose of pain medication. If thepatient is due for medication, a dose will be administered; if the patient is not duefor medication, no dose will be administered. TRANSFER OF THE PATIENT Most facilities have a preoperative checklist to assist the nurse to make sure thatall the needed components have been checked prior to sending the patient to theoperating room (OR). All pertinent documentation\u2014the signed consent form,the patient's chart, and current lab results\u2014accompanies the patient to the OR. The Intraoperative Period The intraoperative period is the time involved with the surgical procedure. Thefocus during this time is on asepsis and protection of the patient. Within the oper-ative suite, the staff wears scrub suits. They change into the scrub shirt and pantswhen they get to the locker room within the surgical area. A surgical cap covershair. Shoe covers are worn to prevent tracking bacteria or dirt from other areas intothe operating rooms. THE SURGICAL TEAM Members of the surgical team include the surgeon, a surgical assistant, an anesthesi-ologist or anesthetist, a circulating nurse, a scrub nurse or surgical tech, and a hold-ing area nurse. The surgeon is the doctor who will perform the surgery. The surgical3481 CHAPTER 13 Perioperative Care assistant may be another surgeon, a surgical resident, an RN first assist, or a physi- cian's assistant. The person providing anesthesia and monitoring the vital signs of the patient is either an anesthesiologist (a physician) or a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA). The circulating nurse is a registered nurse who acts as the patient advocate, obtains the necessary supplies for the procedure, makes sure diag- nostic studies and blood products are available if necessary, prepares the operativetable, positions the patient (padding bony prominences if necessary), and cleansesthe skin in the operative area before positioning surgical drapes. The scrub nurse or surgical tech sets up the sterile field, assists with draping the patient, and hands ster- ile supplies into the operative field and takes used instruments from the surgeon. Thecirculating nurse and scrub nurse (or surgical tech) together count all instruments,sponges, and sharps used in the surgical field. The count is performed before, dur-ing, and after the procedure. The holding area nurse cares for the patients who have been brought into the operating room suite but who are not yet ready to go into theoperating room. The holding area nurse may be managing several patients at onetime and can also help to transport and transfer the patient. Before entering the operating room, the members of the surgical team scrub at the sink just outside the room in which the surgery will be performed. Prior to start-ing the scrub, the team member applies a mask with face shield or goggles. Thesurgical scrub is usually timed and covers the area from the fingertips to 2 inchesabove the elbows. The surgical scrub renders the skin clean, not sterile. After thescrub, the skin is dried with a sterile towel. A sterile gown, then sterile gloves areapplied. The front of the gown is considered sterile in the front from two inchesbelow the neck to the waist and from the elbow to the wrist. The circulating nurseapplies the gown and gloves unassisted, and then assists the other members of theteam into their gown and gloves as they enter the room. RISK FOR INJURY During the surgery, the patient is anesthetized and cannot tell you if there is pres-sure anywhere. The patient is positioned to allow for maximal access to the opera-tive site. This sometimes causes unnatural positioning of the patient or the patient'sextremities. The operative table is padded to decrease pressure on the patient. Theremay be additional padding added to areas of flexion or bony prominences to reducethe risk of pressure ulcer formation or nerve damage due to positioning. Heat loss can occur during surgery. The patient is sent to the operating room in a hospital gown, which may be pulled up or removed depending on the body loca-tion of the surgery. The body is draped for privacy so that only the surgical area isexposed. The temperature within the operating room is kept rather cool becausethe air exchange rate is higher within the operating room than in other rooms 482 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified (to decrease bacterial counts), and the staff are wearing double layers of clothes. Warmers can be set up for the patients during certain procedures when heat loss isexpected\u2014a large, open operative site or a long duration of surgery. At the end of the surgical procedure, the wound is closed. The closure is to hold the wound edges together and to prevent contamination. Closure may be achievedwith sutures (either absorbable or nonabsorbable), staples, glue, or skin closuretape. Nonabsorbable sutures and staples will have to be removed in the post-operative period. Drains may be inserted near the operative site if significant wound drainage is anticipated. Some drains are attached to suction, some have self-suction, and somewill drain due to gravity. The wound site is covered with a sterile dressing beforethe patient is transferred out of the operating room. ANESTHESIA Anesthesia can be administered via general or regional routes (for major proce-dures) or conscious sedation (for minor procedures). General anesthesia rendersthe patient unconscious and incapable of breathing on his or her own; pain recep-tion is also blocked. These patients must be intubated and mechanically ventilatedfor the duration of the anesthesia. Regional anesthesia can be achieved throughnerve blocks, or epidural or spinal anesthesia. Nerve blocks occur when an anes-thetic agent is injected into an area immediately surrounding a particular nerve or nerve bundle. The nerve tissue becomes anesthetized, effectively causing thetissue that it supplies to become pain-free. With epidural anesthesia, an anestheticagent is injected into the epidural space surrounding the spinal column, usually inthe lower lumbar area. The nerves become anesthetized as they leave the spinalcolumn, causing the area of the body supplied by these nerves to become pain-free.This anesthesia is most commonly associated with childbirth but is used for manysurgical procedures. Spinal anesthesia is not commonly used; the anesthetic agentis injected into the cerebrospinal fluid. Patient positioning is very important, asgravity will cause the anesthetic agent to travel. The patient must remain flat afterthe procedure to prevent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the puncture site. The Postoperative Period After the surgery, the patient enters the postoperative period. The immediate post-operative period requires close monitoring as the patient emerges from anesthesia.4483 CHAPTER 13 Perioperative Care The patient will then be transferred to either a same-day surgery area for discharge home that day or an inpatient surgical unit for care. After discharge from the hospi-tal, the patient may need home care. Return to full activities may take several weeks. POSTANESTHESIA CARE The patient is transferred from the operating room to the postanesthesia care unit(PACU) for close monitoring in the immediate postoperative period. Initial assess-ment is focused on ABC: airway, breathing, and circulation. Monitor the patient'sairway, gas exchange, pulse oximetry, oxygen delivery, accessory muscle use, andbreath sounds. The patient can develop stridor due to edema or bronchospasm. Thecardiovascular status is checked next. Vital signs are checked every 15 minutesuntil stabilized; pulse, blood pressure, and cardiac rhythm are monitored. The surgical wound is checked for signs of drainage or bleeding. The dressing is checked. The drains are checked for output and patency. Tubes that need to beconnected to suction (such as nasogastric tubes) are connected. Intravenous fluidsare monitored. Neurologic assessment is performed to check level of consciousness. Following general anesthesia, the patient follows a predictable progression in the return toconsciousness. Initially there is muscular irritability, and then restlessness followedby pain recognition and the ability to reason and control behavior. Pupil responsesare monitored, looking for bilaterally equal responses to light. Motor responses aremonitored, looking initially for purposeful response to painful stimuli and later forresponse to command. Pain management is begun during this time. As the anes-thetic agent wears off, it is important to assess the patient's level of pain. This maybe assessed through subjective information in patients who are conscious, or throughmore objective signs in patients who are still in semiconscious states. Monitor forchanges in vital signs (elevated pulse and BP), changes in movement, and moan-ing. Expected pain levels can be estimated from the type of surgery and give a start-ing point for those patients as they begin to come out of the anesthesia. Gastrointestinal status is monitored for presence of nausea or vomiting. This may be a reaction or side effect to anesthesia. Check for abdominal distention andpresence of bowel sounds. Monitor drainage from nasogastric tube; note amountand color of drainage. Monitor laboratory results as indicated. Electrolyte levels, hemoglobin or hema- tocrit levels, BUN and creatinine, arterial blood gases (ABGs), or other studies maybe necessary in the immediate postoperative period. The diagnostic studies neces-sary will depend on the patient's history, the estimated blood loss during surgery,and the type of procedure performed.484 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified After the initial recovery time, the stable patient who is transferred from the PACU to the same-day surgical area continues to be monitored. Vital signs are taken, although not as frequently. Respiratory and cardiovascular functions aremonitored. Cardiac rhythm is no longer monitored. The dressing is checked forany drainage. Bowel sounds are checked. Clear fluids are given if the patient is notexperiencing nausea. Patients are monitored for urinary output prior to being dis-charged to home. Patients who are admitted to the hospital are transferred from the PACU to a surgical unit. Vital signs, respiration, and cardiovascular status are checked. Thedressing is monitored for drainage; drainage tubes are monitored for output. Intra- venous lines are monitored for signs of infiltration and proper flow rates. Bowelsounds are monitored. Patients who are unstable or who have had extensive procedures are transferred to intensive care for close monitoring. Nurses who are used to caring for complex,unstable patients care for these patients. Their vital signs are closely monitored.Some patients will still be on mechanical ventilation. POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS The focus of care that is common for all of these postoperative patients is identi-fication of complications. Common complications involve the cardiac, respiratory,and gastrointestinal areas, and infections. Just the Facts Cardiovascular Complications WHAT WENT WRONG? Patients may develop cardiovascular complications due to the physiological stressof surgery, side effects of the anesthesia or other medications, or comorbidities.Myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrhythmias, or hypotension are likely duringor in the immediate postoperative period. When getting the patient out of bed forthe first time after surgery, it is good practice to have the patient sit on the side ofthe bed for a minute or two before standing up to ascertain if the patient feels dizzy5485 CHAPTER 13 Perioperative Care due to a drop in blood pressure associated with position change. Deep vein throm- bosis (DVT) is a later vascular complication associated with inflammation anddecreased mobility after surgery. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Chest pain which may radiate to back, neck, jaw, or arm due to ischemia in MI Shortness of breath due to altered cardiac output and tissue perfusion Dizziness or lightheadedness due to diminished cardiac output and cerebraltissue perfusion or cardiac arrhythmia Palpitations due to cardiac arrhythmias due to myocardial irritability\u2014possibly due to ischemia,medication side effect, or electrolyte imbalance Low blood pressure due to diminished cardiac output Unilateral calf pain and lower extremity swelling due to DVT INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Elevated troponin levels in MI. EKG shows ST elevation or T-wave inversion with lack of oxygen deliveryto myocardial tissue. Cardiac monitor or EKG shows arrhythmia. BP below normal level. Doppler ultrasound of extremity shows clot within blood vessel. TREATMENT Monitor cardiac rhythm. Administer antiarrhythmic medications to stabilize cardiac rhythm. Administer intravenous fluids to expand circulating blood volume to raiseblood pressure. Administer blood-thinning medications to decrease likelihood of clot or heparin DIAGNOSES Decreased cardiac output Ineffective cardiopulmonary tissue perfusion Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion Impaired physical mobility NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs for changes. Check blood pressure lying down and sitting up for orthostatic change. Monitor cardiovascular status for cardiac rhythm, heart sounds, peripheral pulses, capillary refill, and pulse deficit. Assess for peripheral edema. Ask patient about calf pain or tenderness. Monitor intravenous site for signs of infiltration. Encourage ambulation and leg exercises to prevent development of DVT. Monitor proper use of elastic stockings or sequential compression devicespostoperatively. Respiratory Complications Patients with preexisting respiratory disorders, obesity, or thoracic or upper abdom-inal surgical procedures are at greater risk of developing respiratory complicationspostoperatively. WHAT WENT WRONG? After surgery, patients are not as mobile. This lack of physical activity leads todiminished chest wall and diaphragmatic movement, resulting in a decreasedamount of air exchange. Alveolar sacs can collapse, leading to areas of atelectasis.6487 CHAPTER 13 Perioperative Care Pain medications can adversely affect respiratory status by decreasing respiratory drive. Patients at increased risk for respiratory complications may develop pneu-monia in the postoperative period due to diminished airflow, increased respiratorysecretions, and inflammatory processes. Patients with increased risk for clotting orDVT, or those with hypercoagulable states are at risk for developing a pulmonaryembolism. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Shortness of breath due to diminished airflow and resultant decreased oxy-genation Chest pain in the area of atelectasis due to collapse of the alveolar sacs withinthat area of the lung Productive cough due to pneumonia Fever due to infection in pneumonia Sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath in pulmonary embolism asclot blocks arterial blood flow within the lung Diminished oxygen levels as gas exchange is impaired in atelectasis, pneu-monia, or pulmonary embolism INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Pulse oximetry shows diminished oxygenation. Chest x-ray shows area of collapse in atelectasis, infiltrate in pneumonia,wedge infiltrate in pulmonary embolism. CT scan shows alveolar collapse in atelectasis, area of infiltrate in pneumonia. Spiral CT or helical CT shows clot in pulmonary embolism. WBC elevated in bacterial pneumonia. TREATMENT Administer supplemental oxygen. Administer antibiotics for pneumonia\u2014initially intravenously, then orally: macrolides agents to prevent enlarging of clot or development of new clots in pulmonary embolism. Mechanical ventilation if necessary. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective breathing pattern Ineffective airway clearance Impaired gas exchange Ineffective cardiopulmonary tissue perfusion NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs for changes. Monitor respiratory status: check respiratory rate, rhythm, and depth; checkskin color; listen to breath sounds. Monitor pulse oximetry level for oxygenation. Monitor intravenous site for signs of infiltration. Encourage coughing and deep breathing exercises. Encourage incentive spirometer use. Encourage early ambulation. Infection The skin is the body's first line of defense against infection. During surgery thisline of defense is penetrated. Even though the surgical procedure is performed inas aseptic an environment as possible, the possibility of infection still exists. WHAT WENT WRONG? Wound infections can develop in the postoperative period. The wound may becontaminated before surgery, such as with penetrating trauma, or may becomeinfected during healing. The surface of the skin has bacteria that are naturally7489 CHAPTER 13 Perioperative Care present, referred to as normal flora. These bacteria may enter the wound and cause infection. Nosocomial infections can also occur at the surgical site, caused bybacteria found elsewhere in the hospital. Infection within the surgical wound willslow approximation of the wound edges, delaying wound healing. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Increase in pain at surgical wound due to inflammatory process early ininfection Redness at wound edges that spreads if untreated Drainage from wound site due to body's response to bacterial presence (changein color and odor of drainage) Fever due to infection Elevated white blood cell count INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Elevated WBC due to body's response to bacterial presence. Elevated erythrocyte sedementation rate due to inflammation. Culture of wound area will identify organism. Sensitivity test will identify appropriate antibiotic treatment. TREATMENT Obtain culture and sensitivity test of wound. Administer appropriate antibiotics intravenously. Keep wound site clean and dry. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for infection Impaired skin integrity Impaired tissue integrity Delayed surgical recovery490 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor vital signs; look for fever. Assess surgical wound for redness, drainage. Ask patient about pain at surgical site. When obtaining wound culture, remove surface drainage with gauze, then obtain specimen from within wound edge (this will ensure that the organismis actually from the wound and not from the skin). Gastrointestinal Complications Following administration of anesthesia or pain medication, patients may experi-ence nausea, vomiting, constipation, or paralytic ileus. WHAT WENT WRONG? Nausea is a common side effect of both anesthesia and pain medications. A patient'sreaction to anesthetic agents varies. Some patients have a lot of nausea after anes-thesia that may last for several hours. Abdominal surgery may cause direct visceralafferent stimulation, resulting in nausea and vomiting. Medications may act uponthe chemoreceptor trigger zone, located within the medulla outside the blood-brainbarrier. Once the patient begins vomiting, antiemetic medication may be necessaryto break the cycle. Opiod-based medications and decreased activity can both causeslowing of peristaltic activity, leading to constipation. Patients having abdominalprocedures are at greater risk for paralytic ileus as a postoperative complication. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Nausea as a side effect of medication V omiting due to visceral afferent stimulation or activation of chemoreceptortrigger zone Mild, generalized abdominal discomfort and distention with paralytic ileusdue to decreased intestinal motility Slow bowel sounds with constipation; absent bowel sounds with paralyticileus due to changes in intestinal motility8491 CHAPTER 13 Perioperative Care INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Electrolyte abnormality due to vomiting. Abdominal flat and upright x-ray shows stool in constipation, gas-filled intes- tinal loops in paralytic ileus. TREATMENT Monitor abdomen for distention; listen for bowel sounds. Assess for dehydration as a result of prolonged vomiting. Restrict oral intake in paralytic ileus or if nausea and vomiting are present. Nasogastric (NG) tube connected to suction to prevent vomiting in paralyticileus. Progress diet as tolerated once bowel sounds return and patient is passingflatus rectally. Administer intravenous fluids. Administer total parenteral nutrition. Administer antiemetics as required. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than what body requires Risk for imbalanced fluid volume Risk for delayed surgical recovery Risk for constipation Altered bowel elimination NURSING INTERVENTIONS Ask patient about presence of nausea. Monitor vital signs for changes. Listen to bowel sounds; assess abdomen for distention. Monitor intravenous site for signs of infiltration, pain, and redness.492 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Monitor intake and output. Monitor color and amount of fluid drained from NG tube. Ask patient if he or she is passing any flatus rectally or having bowel move- ment. Quiz 1. Donna is a healthy, 46-year-old female scheduled for elective surgery next week.

If fertilization does not occur, theuterus will remove the prepared lining, termed menstrual bleeding. Menstruationbegins in the early teens (menarche) and ends around age 50 (menopause). TheLearning Objectives Breast cancer Cervical cancerDysmenorrheaEctopic incompatibilityPreeclampsia and Eclampsia 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Key Terms Women's Health average age of menarche for African-Americans is 9 to 11 years while for Cau- casians it is from 10 to 12 years. The cycle is controlled by hormones from the hypo-thalamus, pituitary, ovaries, and the uterus. A normal menstrual cycle is 28 days,but only about 25 percent of women actually are on this schedule. The average canrun from 21 to 35 days. The menstrual cycle is often divided into three phases,dependent upon the hormones. The beginning of menstruation is the start of thefollicular phase which lasts until day 14. As hormone levels are low, the thickenedlining of the uterus begins to shed. The cramping that is felt is from small uterinecontractions, helping to shed the lining. An egg follicle begins to mature due to growing levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which also causes estrogensecretion. The increase in estrogen causes the endometrium to mature and thicken.The last five days of the follicular phase plus the day of ovulation are the most fer-tile days. Upon ovulation, on day 14, the oocyte, or egg, is released from the follicledue to a surge in luteinizing hormon (LH). The egg is expelled near the opening ofone of the fallopian tubes, (oviducts, uterine tubes), located laterally at the top of theuterus. Fertilization usually occurs in one of the tubes. The embryo now travels tothe uterus, the primary job of which is to sustain development. A nonpregnant uterusmeasures about 7 \u00d7 5 cm. As it is a muscular organ, it is capable of great stretching. At the distal end of the uterus is the cervix which attaches to the superior portion ofthe vagina. The luteal phase starts next with LH causing the follicle to secrete prog-esterone instead of estrogen. Progesterone causes the endometrial lining to begin tothicken in preparation for implantation of a fertilized cell. Progesterone inhibitsrelease of FSH and LH. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum, containingthe oocyte, dies, which lowers the level of progesterone. Sloughing of the liningbegins about the 28th day of the cycle, resulting in a flow of blood and cellular debristhrough the vagina. The cycle will begin again. Primary amenorrhea is the absenceof menses by age 16. Secondary amenorrhea is the absence of menses for more than6 months in a woman who previously was menstruating regularly. Just the Facts Breast Cancer Studies show that by age 80, about 1 in 8 women will have breast cancer. Ten per-cent of all breast cancers are inherited. Two major genes have been identified\u2014BRCA1 and BRCA2.1498 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified WHAT WENT WRONG? Despite the research and advances in medicine, the cause of breast cancer is un- known. Some studies have implicated a higher-fat diet. Some medications, likeestrogen, seem to increase the risk of breast cancer. Exposure to radiation alsoincreases the risk. Childlessness and delayed childbirth also may be factors. PROGNOSIS Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women and the num-ber one cancer in women. Prognosis depends on the stage at which the cancer isdiscovered. Those with no involved lymph nodes have the best expectations.With lymph node involvement, survival ranges from 50 to 75 percent for fiveyears. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Mass in breast, usually painless Nipple inversion, drainage Bone pain from metastasis Cough from lung metastasis INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Mammography may show mass. Biopsy is confirmative for cancer. Ultrasonography to further delineate the mass. MRI of breast. CT scan to check for metastasis. TREATMENTS Treatment for breast cancer is either curative or palliative, depending on the stag-ing of the tumor and involvement of lymph nodes. Lumpectomy for small tumors.499 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Mastectomy for larger tumors or more than two tumors in the same breast. Chemotherapy before surgery to shrink some tumors, or after surgery: mastectomy for women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. NURSING DIAGNOSES Body image disturbance. Anticipatory grieving. Altered sexuality patterns. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Allow patient to voice concerns and questions over treatment plans. Monitor incision site, dressing, and drainage. Check for signs and symptoms of infection. Explain to patient: Disease. Use of affected arm. Use of pain medication, timing, and side effects. Urge follow-up mammography. Discuss low-fat diet.500 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Cervical Cancer The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear has markedly increased early detection of cervical cancer and thus decreased the mortality. WHAT WENT WRONG? Abnormal cells, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), are the initial indicationon a Pap smear, and are more common in women with HIV and those infectedwith human papillomavirus (HPV), subtypes 16, 18. HPV is more common inwomen with multiple sexual partners, those having sex at an early age, and thosewith HIV . PROGNOSIS Prognosis is dependent upon the stage at which the cancer is discovered. The five-year survival rate ranges from 60 to 80 percent. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Vaginal bleeding due to abnormal cells and ulceration of the cervix Postcoital bleeding Pelvic pain INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Pap smear. Biopsy to confirm disease and determine staging. Cone biopsy which provides a sample of tissue of the lateral margins of thecervix. TREATMENT Cone biopsy may remove enough of the dysplasia.2501 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Ablation of the lesion with cryotherapy, which freezes the cells. Hysterectomy with lymph node biopsy for women with late-stage cancer or those with early-stage cancer who have completed childbearing. Radiation. Chemotherapy: cisplatin 5-fluorouracil NURSING DIAGNOSES Altered sexuality patterns Personal identity disturbance Disturbance in self-esteem NURSING INTERVENTIONS HPV vaccine. Offer pain and antiemetic medications. Abdominal assessment\u2014distention, bowel sounds. Check vaginal bleeding. Assess urinary retention. Intake and output. Assess vital signs; check for fever. Remove vaginal packing when directed. Emotional reassurances. Explain to the patient: Need for Pap tests. All procedures. Support through cancer treatments. Use of pain and antiemetic medications. Benefit of early ambulation. Safer sex practices.502 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Dysmenorrhea Menstrual pain occurring after ovulation for which no cause can be discerned is called dysmenorrhea. WHAT WENT WRONG? Dysmenorrhea is caused by the changing hormones in the reproductive cycle.Uterine contractions from prostaglandins and blood vessel constriction in the uterine lining cause the discomfort as the enriched lining prepares to besloughed off. PROGNOSIS Dysmenorrhea usually begins one to two years after menarche and becomesmore acute with age. Pregnancy often diminishes the severity of dysmenorrhea,as does age. Some women are debilitated for several days per month. A largemajority of women experience some degree of discomfort. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Cramps from small uterine contractions Nausea from fluctuating hormone levels Headache from declining hormone levels INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Pelvic exam is normal. Hemoglobin and hematocrit may be slightly declined from excessive bloodloss. TREATMENTS Over-the-counter preparations. Hot water bottles.3503 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Home remedies. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have antiprostaglandin activities, which decrease the discomfort: ibuprofen naproxen nabumetone Oral contraceptives which inhibit ovulation as well as diminish amountof menstrual flow and dysmenorrhea. NURSING DIAGNOSES Intolerance for activity Pain, discomfort NURSING INTERVENTIONS Explain to the patient: The disease. Benefit of exercise. Medication use, timing, and side effects. Ectopic Pregnancy Ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized ovum implants in an area otherthan the uterus. Most ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tubes; how-ever, other possible sites for ectopic pregnancy include the ovary, cervix, andperitoneum. WHAT WENT WRONG? When the fertilized ovum is unable to get to the uterus, it may settle in the fallop-ian tube. Any blockage, stricture, previous surgery on the tube, infection or inflam-mation may impede the ovum from its final, proper destination.4504 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified PROGNOSIS Ectopic pregnancy is the greatest cause of maternal death early in the pregnancy if diagnosis cannot be made. Rupture of the involved organ and excessive bleed-ing into the peritoneum may occur. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Severe, lancinating (stabbing) lower pelvic pain from the growing embryostretching the fallopian tube or other structure Backache from pressure on these structures Vaginal spotting; bleeding; amenorrhea INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Beta hCG serum levels will be elevated but not as high as during an intra-uterine pregnancy. Ultrasound will show an empty uterus. Urine pregnancy test will be positive. TREATMENTS Surgery is planned to remove the fertilized egg. Often the egg can be retrievedlaparoscopically if the pregnancy is early. Surgery will involve removal of the eggand may involve partial or complete removal of the fallopian tube (called salping-ectomy\u2014partial or complete). NURSING DIAGNOSES Body image disturbance Anticipatory grieving Pain, discomfort505 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health NURSING INTERVENTIONS Check vaginal bleeding. Check incision site. Assess abdomen\u2014bowel sounds, distention. Assess voiding patterns. Administer pain medication. Check vital signs, temperature. Explain to the patient: Use of pain medication. Benefit of early ambulation. Increased chance of future ectopic pregnancies. Endometrial Cancer One of the most common gynecological cancers in women, it is most often diag- nosed in postmenopausal women. WHAT WENT WRONG? Abnormal tissue grows rapidly, affected most often by estrogen. Eventually, thisabnormal tissue, hyperplasia, turns into a cancer. Some causes of elevated estrogen levels are exogenous estrogen, polycystic ovarian disease, and estrogen-producing tumors. Risk factors for endometrial cancer include endometrialhyperplasia, tamoxifen, diabetes type II, nulliparity, obesity (estrogen is stored inadipose tissue). PROGNOSIS Prognosis is dependent upon the stage and grade of the cancer upon diagnosis.Staging of the tumor (I-IV) can only be done via surgery and grading is basedon the histology of the tumor (GI, GII, GIII). In patients with stage IV , the 5-yearsurvival rate is 10 percent.5506 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Abnormal bleeding Abnormal Pap test (not diagnostic but begs a further work-up) INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Pap test. Endometrial biopsy. Endocervical curettage. Ca-125. TREATMENT Surgery initially for to remove the tumor\u2014usually hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsy of nodes. Radiation. Hormone therapy: progestins Chemotherapy used cancers that recur outside the pelvis: doxorubicin cisplatin ifosphamide NURSING DIAGNOSES Anticipatory grieving Body image disturbance Sexual dysfunction NURSING INTERVENTIONS Check vaginal bleeding.507 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Check incision site. Assess abdomen for bowel sounds, distention. Check urinary output. Administer pain medication. Check vital signs, temperature. Emotional reassurance. Explain to the patient: Use of pain medication. Benefit of early ambulation. Increased chance of future ectopic pregnancies. Fibroids (Leiomyomas) Leiomyomas are smooth muscle tumors of the uterus. Since they are hormone- receptive, the tumors will change in size with the menses. WHAT WENT WRONG? It is unknown what causes the proliferation of these smooth muscle tumors.Fibroids are more common in African-American women. PROGNOSIS Since the tumors are hormone-responsive, they will shrink with menopause.However, in patients with large tumors, pain, and excessive bleeding, treatment isnecessary. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Bleeding, anemia Pain, from a large tumor Pressure6508 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Labwork will show a declining Hgb and Hct. Ultrasound, MRI, CT scan, and hysteroscopy will all show a tumor. TREATMENTS Watchful waiting. Surgery\u2014myometomy if childbearing is to be preserved, or hysterectomy if childbearing is completed. Hormones may help to shrink the tumor. NURSING DIAGNOSES Pain, discomfort Fatigue Disturbed body image NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor CBC to check anemia. Check vaginal bleeding. Check incision site. Administer pain medication. Check vital signs, temperature. Explain to patient: Use of pain medication. Increased chance of future ectopic pregnancies. Encourage early ambulation. Infertility Infertility is the inability of a reproductive-age couple to conceive after 12 months ofunprotected sexual intercourse. More than 50 percent of the time the reproductive7509 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health tract of the woman is at issue. Primary infertility is when a woman has never had a pregnancy; secondary is when it occurs in a woman who has had one or morepregnancies. WHAT WENT WRONG? At fault may be decreased secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary, failureto ovulate, endometriosis, or past infections causing blockage of the reproductivetract. Structural problems (blocked fallopian tubes, or anovulation), poor spermmotility and/or count, or multifactorial problems can cause infertility. Prior expo-sure to radiation, medications, exercise frequency, and menstrual cycle and lengthneed to be evaluated. PROGNOSIS Infertility affects about 15 percent or more of couples. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Inability to achieve conception INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Semen analysis. Menstrual diary. Sonogram to view endometrial anatomy. Endometrial biopsy to check on hormone status and to determine ifthe lining is able to support a fertilized ovum, leiomyomas arepresent. uterine, ovarian, pituitary, and thyroid function. Hysterosalpingogram to view uterus, fallopian tubes. Postcoital test\u2014cervix is checked for patency and whether the mucous isthin enough for sperm to penetrate.510 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENTS Treatments depend on the cause of the infertility. For abnormal sperm findings: Urology referral. Check medications\u2014calcium channel blockers can impair sperm function. Artificial insemination. For anovulation: LH/FSH to stimulate ovulation. Bromocriptine for hypothalamic dysfunction. Clomiphene to stimulate ovulation. For structural aberrations: Surgery to repair tube. Myomectomy to remove leiomyomas. Surgery to lyse adhesions. In vitro fertilization. NURSING DIAGNOSES Body image disturbance Defensive coping Risk for parenting NURSING INTERVENTIONS Explain to the patient: Suggest support groups. Encourage questions. Discuss tests. Menopause Menopause is defined as 12 months without a menses. Few follicles are left to mature, levels of hormones decline, ovulation no longer occurs, and the uterinelining no longer needs to thicken in preparation for a fertilized egg.8511 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health WHAT WENT WRONG? Natural progression of life PROGNOSIS The average age of menopause in the United States is 51. About 50 percent of American women experience some symptoms of menopause. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Lack of menstrual cycle Breasts, vagina, and uterus shrink in response to decreased estrogen and progesterone Vasomotor flushing due to estrogen levels falling Moodiness due to changing hormone levels Cardiovascular risks increase due to less estrogen Osteoporosis is a risk factor due to less estrogen Vaginal mucous dryness from less hormones INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Increase in FSH during menopause. Decrease in LH during menopause. Estrogen levels decline. TREATMENTS Some women elect to begin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (in women witha uterus) or estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) (in women without a uterus), toameliorate the vasomotor flushing and menopausal signs and symptoms, and to de-crease the risk of coronary artery disease. NURSING DIAGNOSES Effective management of individual therapeutic regimen512 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Decisional conflict Personal identity disturbance NURSING INTERVENTIONS Explain to the patient: Bodily changes. Effects of HRT and ERT. Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer because it is usually ad- vanced before it is detected. There is no proven screening test for ovarian cancer. There are no definitive early signs. Some women experience vague abdom- inal discomfort and bloating. WHAT WENT WRONG? A woman who has never had a child or who has had only one or two children, isat higher risk for ovarian cancer. Women with a history of breast cancer, coloncancer, or a family history of these are at a higher risk of ovarian cancer. There isan association between endometriosis and ovarian cancer. PROGNOSIS Unfortunately, prognosis for ovarian cancer is poor. Over 75 percent of womenare diagnosed at an advanced stage. The prognosis is more grim if the CA-125level is elevated, and if the disease has spread. The higher the staging, the worsethe prognosis. Of stage IV patients, 5 percent survive five years. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Bloating from the enlarging tumor Pelvic mass9513 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Dyspnea due to pressure from the diaphragm from an enlarging tumor Ascites\u2014abnormal abdominal fluid INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS An elevated CA-125 indicates a tumor may be malignant. Transvaginal ultrasound for detection of disease. TREATMENTS Treatment depends on the staging at diagnosis. Surgical staging is necessary. Complete abdominal hysterectomy, with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and node dissection. Complete removal of all visible tumor and metastasis-debulking. Chemotherapy: cisplatin carboplatin paclitaxel Radiation. NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective breathing pattern Hopelessness Anxiety NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor CBC to check anemia. Check vaginal bleeding. Check incision site. Abdominal assessment\u2014check for bowel sounds, distention.514 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Check vital signs, temperature. Administer pain medication. Emotional reassurance. Explain to the patient: Benefit of early ambulation. Use of pain medication. Treatments promoted by the oncologist. Ovarian Masses, Benign The most common ovarian cysts are follicular. WHAT WENT WRONG? The egg is enclosed in a follicle as it waits to be expelled monthly from the ovary. When the follicle does not open to allow the egg out or the follicle is not reab-sorbed, a benign cyst, a fluid-filled sac, may result. PROGNOSIS Most cysts resolve in several months. However, a small percentage of patientsexperience discomfort or pain when the cyst does not resolve. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Asymptomatic Changes in menstruation Unilateral pelvic pain (usually one ovary is involved) Sharp pelvic pain, which indicates rupture INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Pregnancy test.10515 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Pelvic exam. Ultrasound. TREATMENTS Watchful waiting since most cysts resolve. Oral contraceptives. Surgery to remove the cyst. NURSING DIAGNOSES Pain, discomfort Anxiety NURSING INTERVENTIONS Reassure her that a large majority of cysts resolve. Explain to the patient: Cause of her pain. The menstrual cycle, pain may be worse during ovulation. Medication use. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) PID is a variety of inflammation and infection of the upper genital tract, which includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and other structures. It includes endo-metritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis. WHAT WENT WRONG? Bacteria from the cervix and vagina migrate to the upper genital tract. Usual Most infections are due to a mix of bacteria. PID occurs most often in sexually active women and is more common in adolescents. PID is more commonwith multiple sexual partners, a young age, unprotected sex, and a history of sexu-ally transmitted disease. PROGNOSIS About one in ten sexually active women will experience PID in her lifetime and25 percent of those will experience a major complication such as infertility, ectopicpregnancy, abscess, or chronic pain. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Abdominal tenderness Adnexal tenderness (ovaries and fallopian tubes) Cervical motion tenderness (pain on movement of the cervix) due to aninfection Fever Vaginal discharge Dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) Elevated white blood cell count INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CBC will show an elevated WBC Pregnancy test\u2014beta hCG Chlamydia test Gonorrhea test Venereal Disease Laboratory (VDRL) test for syphilis Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test for Fluorescent (FTA-ABS) test used to confirm syphilis Chandelier sign\u2014a great amount of pain is elicited when the cervix istouched (the woman will jump to the chandelier)517 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health TREATMENTS Most patients are able to be managed in an outpatient setting with antibiotics: ofloxacin and metronidazole ceftriaxone and doxycycline azithromycin and metronidazole Those who are pregnant, who present with an abscess or peritonitis, or with GI symptoms require inpatient and doxycycline clindamycin and gentamycin azithromycin and metronidazole Sexual partners must also be treated. NURSING DIAGNOSES Pain, discomfort Sexual dysfunction Risk of infection NURSING INTERVENTIONS Teach patient about: Spread of the disease. Practicing safe sex. Medication use and side effects. Necessity of treating all partners. Trophoblastic Disease Trophoblastic neoplasias are abnormal cells growing from a shell that formsbetween the embryo and the endometrium. The four disease entities are calledhydatidiform mole (partial or invasive Demystified cental site trophoblastic tumor. A complete mole is formed when an egg that has no DNA is fertilized by a sperm. A partial mole has DNA from both parents and usu-ally fetal parts. An invasive mole is a hydatidiform mole in the endometrium.Choriocarcinomas are tumors composed of trophoblasts with bleeding. Placentalsite trophoblastic tumors are trophoblasts which intrude the myometrium. All aresuggestive of malignancy and require a full metastatic work-up, including CT scanof brain, kidneys, liver, and lung. WHAT WENT WRONG? There is thought to be a problem with the genetic material of the zygotes. Thechances are increased with an older mother, prior molar pregnancy, and a historyof miscarriage. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is the best for a woman diagnosed with a hydatidiform mole. Approx-imately 20 percent of complete mole pregnancies result in further trophoblasticdisease. The remaining three diagnoses may point to malignancy. Most non-metastatic malignancies have a good remission rate after treatment. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Usual pregnancy signs during the first trimester Vaginal passing of a grapelike cluster of vesicles Vaginal bleeding Abnormally elevted hCG Abnormally large uterus Absence of fetal heart tones Elevated blood pressure INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Pelvic examination. hCG higher than expected serum levels in blood pregnancy test. Ultrasound.519 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health TREATMENTS Dilation and Curettage (D&C) to remove all trophoblastic cells. Frequent testing of hCG levels to ensure no further cells remain. Chest x-ray to assess for lung metastasis. Liver function tests to assess for liver metastasis. Contraception for a full year. Chemotherapy till hCG levels return to normal: methotrexate actinomycin-d Total abdominal hysterectomy and chemotherapy. NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk of altered parenting Anticipatory grieving Powerlessness NURSING INTERVENTIONS Educate the patient: Trophoblastic disease. Discuss further testing. Allow for grieving. Provide referrals to counselors, clergy. Discuss need for year-long birth control. Pregnancy Gestational age is measured from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). At each prenatal visit, the fundus (the top of the uterus) will be measured as to itslocation in the abdomen. This information is used to assess the growth of thefetus. Pregnancy is usually divided into trimesters. The first trimester is from 0 to13520 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified 14 weeks, and starts at implantation. During this time, it is not uncommon to feel more fatigue, nausea, and morning sickness. At two months, the uterus is the sizeof a grapefruit. At nine weeks, the embryo is called a fetus and is about one inchin length. During the first trimester, most major organs have developed. The sec-ond trimester is from 14 to 28 weeks, and is characterized by less breast tender-ness, less fatigue, and a diminishing of morning sickness. However, some back painmay begin, as well as stretch marks, heartburn, and hemorrhoids. At 16 weeks, thefundus is halfway between the pubic bone and the umbilicus. At 16 to 18 weeks,fetal movement may be felt. At 27 weeks, the fundus is two inches a bove the umbilicus. The third trimester is from 28 weeks to birth. Less movement will befelt due to the limited space for the fetus to move about. The mother may feelsome respiratory difficulty as the uterus is directly underneath the diaphragm,pushing up the lungs. She may experience some edema, have difficulty sleeping,and an increased urge to urinate due to pressure on the bladder. She may feelBraxton-Hicks contractions, which are mild abdominal cramping. WHAT WENT WRONG? Nothing. PROGNOSIS Healthy baby after nine months gestation. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Symptoms and signs are usually due to pregnancy, but none are diagnostic. Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting Breast enlargement and tenderness Quickening (feeling fetal movements) Weight gain Absence of menses Signs: Abdominal enlargement521 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Breast enlargement Softening of cervix Increased pigmentation and enlargement of areolae Chadwick's sign\u2014vagina and cervix show a blue hue from increased vas- culature INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG): plasma hCG\u2014positive 3 to 4 weeks after LMP. urine hCG\u2014positive one week after first missed menses. serum hCG\u2014will also be elevated in ectopic pregnancy, trophoblastictumors. Fetal heart tones\u2014a positive test of pregnancy. Ultrasound\u2014confirms pregnancy. TREATMENTS Regular visits with health care provider. Prenatal vitamins. Routine labwork. Ultrasound. NURSING DIAGNOSES Altered nutrition Body image disturbance NURSING INTERVENTIONS Discuss bodily changes. Stress importance of prenatal vitamins. Reinforce diet, exercise.522 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Remind of obstetrician appointments. Advise patient when to call the obstetrician: Vaginal bleeding, discharge. Several-hour duration of cramping, pain. Fever. Diminished fetal movements. Sustained vomiting. Labor and Delivery Labor is usually shorter in women who have previously had children than in first- time mothers. The average labor is anywhere from 12 to 24 hours. Labor is typi-cally divided into three stages, with the first stage having two phases. The firststage starts with the beginning of labor, which is uterine contractions which resultin thinning (effacement) and dilation of the cervix. The first stage of labor endswith full dilation, at 10 cm, and complete effacement. This is the longest part oflabor. Contractions are milder, last 60 to 90 seconds, and are 15 to 20 minutes apartin this first phase of labor, termed the latent phase. The active phase occurs whenthe cervix dilates from 4 to 8 cm, contractions become stronger, last about 30 to45 seconds, and are closer together. This is often when the membranes rupture,releasing amniotic fluid. A backache is common, as is some vaginal bleeding.When the cervix is fully dilated at 10 cm, the second stage of labor has started.This phase is fetal expulsion. Contractions continue, but feel different. There ispressure on the rectum, and a strong urge to push. The second stage of labor endswith the birth of the baby. Delivery of the placenta, or afterbirth, is the third stageof labor. Contractions will continue, but will be milder, as the uterus contracts,which helps to expel the placenta and slow the bleeding. WHAT WENT WRONG? Nothing. PROGNOSIS A healthy baby.14523 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Bloody show which is the mucous plug, expelled from the vagina Rupture of membranes, which releases amniotic fluid (commonly referred to as water breaking) INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CBC to assess any anemia. Blood typing. Rh factor. Urinalysis to look for protein and glucose. TREATMENTS Some medications may be administered to stimulate uterine contractions: oxytocin prostaglandins Pain medications may be administered, but always with the safety of the fetusin mind. The risk versus the benefit must be weighed. Demystified Epidural analgesia. Local infiltration. NURSING DIAGNOSES Anxiety Pain, discomfort NURSING INTERVENTIONS Teach the patient: Benefit of continued exercise. Increase fluids, especially in nausea. Observe for signs of dehydration. Eliminate spicy foods to decrease heartburn. Eat small, frequent meals. Increase high-fiber foods to avoid constipation. Prenatal vitamins daily. Support hose for varicose veins. Stool softeners to aid in hemorrhoid pain. Avoid high heels if backache persists. Avoid prolonged sitting. Avoid MMR vaccine in pregnancy. Suggest Lamaze or other labor support groups. Postpartum The time from birth to 6 weeks when involutionary changes occur. WHAT WENT WRONG? Nothing.15525 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health PROGNOSIS Return to prepregnant state. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Vaginal drainage (lochia) lessens, becomes lighter in color Uterus shrinks in size Abdomen shrinks Breasts enlarge and fill with milk Body weight decreases INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS CBC to assess blood loss. TREATMENTS Iron supplementation if indicated. NURSING DIAGNOSES Fatigue Disturbance in body image Effective breastfeeding NURSING INTERVENTIONS Explain lochia (postpartum vaginal discharge)\u2014color, amount. Answer breast-feeding questions. Remind patient to call obstetrician if fever develops, or if there is excessive vaginal bleeding, chest pain, or dyspnea. Discuss contraception\u2014ovulation may occur before menses Rh Incompatibility WHAT WENT WRONG? Rh incompatibility is assessed on each mother during pregnancy. An antigen, Rh, may or may not be on the surface of the red blood cell. If a mother is Rh positive,she carried the Rhesus antigen on the RBC. A fetus has antigens from its motherand father. The Rh is problematic when the mother is Rh and the father is Rh+ . When the mother is Rh and the fetus is Rh +, she may develop antibodies that will cross the placenta and attack the fetal RBCs, which are recognized as foreign. PROGNOSIS Prognosis is good as all mothers are tested during prenatal care. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Incompatibility with Rh of mother and baby INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Rh type. TREATMENT RhoGAM is Rh IgG (immunoglobulin) to prevent an immune response by themother. NURSING DIAGNOSES Safety Risk for injury NURSING INTERVENTIONS Retest if unsure of antibody titer.16527 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Administer RhoGAM. Explain Rh status to the mother. Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia is a condition that women may get in the latter half of pregnancy. It is pregnancy-induced hypertension and more often occurs in a first pregnancy.If preeclampsia is left untreated, eclampsia (which is severe) will result. WHAT WENT WRONG? The etiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia is unknown. Pre-pregnant hyper-tension, obesity, and poor nutrition may be contributing factors. First-time mothershave a greater risk of preeclampsia, as do women with a family history of the condition. PROGNOSIS Preeclampsia can cause a small baby, premature birth, and learning disabilities.Untreated eclampsia can lead to seizures, coma, and even death of the motherand baby. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Preeclampsia (may be asymptomatic): BP > 140/90 Proteinuria (presence of excess serum protein in the urine) >300 mg / 24hours Elevated Headache Rapid weight gain17528 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Abdominal pain Diminished urine output Excessive vomiting and nausea Eclampsia: As above Seizures INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Chemistry panel to assess hydration status as well as kidney and liver function. CBC to asses anemia and platelet count. Urinalysis to look for protein and creatinine in the urine. Fetal ultrasound. TREATMENT Birth of the baby is the only cure for eclampsia and preeclampsia. Mild preeclamp- sia with mild hypertension and a small amount of protein in the urine can be man-aged at home with rest and frequent health care provider checks, depending on thestatus and gestational age of the baby. All other preeclampsia and eclampsia patientsare hospitalized. seizures: magnesium sulfate NURSING DIAGNOSES Safety529 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Risk for altered parenting Altered growth and development NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor blood pressure. Monitor protein in urine. Assist during bedrest. Explain to the patient: The disease. Necessity of low-salt diet. All tests. Crucial Diagnostic Tests Beta Subunit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( -hCG) This test, better known as pregnancy testing, is used to detect early pregnancy and to diagnose or to monitor trophoblastic disease and other hCG secreting tumors. Using a chemilumnescent or florimetric immunoassay, the test measures the levelof hCG in a blood sample. Biopsy Biopsy is removal of tissue from the body for examination to determine if cellu-lar changes have occurred. It is one of the principal tools used in diagnosingcancer. Core or incisional biopsy involves removal of only a sample of tissue.When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure used is an exci-sional biopsy. Needle aspiration biopsy involves the removal of tissue or fluidwith a needle. After the test\u2014Always monitor the patient for bleeding following a biopsy.530 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125) This test measures the amount of the protein, CA 125, in the blood. It is per- formed to monitor existing endometrial and ovarian cancers. This is not a screen-ing test. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) This is an x-ray test that examines the inside of the uterus and fallopian tubes andthe surrounding area. It is used to identify abnormalities, reasons for infertility,tubal pregnancy or infections in the uterus and tubes. A contrast dye is insertedthrough the vagina into the cervix and x-ray pictures are taken as the dye flowsthrough the uterus and fallopian tubes. Before the test\u2014Explain to patient NPO for 6-8 hours before the procedure and that it is normal to experience some cramping during and after the test. Obtaininformed consent. After the test\u2014Monitor the patient after the test for any allergic reaction to the dye. Monitor for excessive vaginal bleeding. Hysteroscopy This test directly examines the lining of the uterus to determine the cause ofabnormal bleeding and infertility. A thin viewing tube called a hysteroscope ismoved through the cervix into the uterus via the vagina. A light and a cameraare hooked to the hysteroscope so that the lining of the uterus can be viewed ona video screen. Before the test\u2014Explain to patient that she must be NPO for 6-8 hours before the procedure. Obtain informed consent. After the test\u2014Monitor for excessive vaginal bleeding. Mammogram A radiological study of the breast tissue in which the breasts are positioned and compressed within a special device to allow optimal imaging. At least two imagesare taken of each breast. This test is used to detect growths within the breast tis-sue, as part of recommended screening for breast cancer. 531 CHAPTER 14 Women's Health Before the test\u2014Explain to patient that she must avoid using lotions, powders and deodorants the day of the tests. Papanicolaou (Pap) Smear This test is a screening test for cervical cancer. During the test the doctor takes asample of cells from the cervix and sends the sample to a laboratory which thenchecks the sample for changes in the cervical cells. Rhesus (Rh) Factor This is a serum test used to check for the presence of a protein, Rh D antigen, onthe surface of the red blood cells. It is used to assess for blood compatibilitybetween mother and fetus. This is a nonfasting test. Semen Analysis This test evaluates the male aspect of a couple's inability to conceive. The patientmust abstain from sex for 2 days and then collect a specimen, which is then micro-scopically evaluated for volume, sperm motility and count. The specimen must bedelivered to the lab within one hour of collection. Quiz 1. Which of the following is a definitive sign of pregnancy? (a) Amenorrhea.

The brain is the only structure without pain receptors.When pain receptors are stimulated, discomfort or pain results, prompting thataction be taken to remove the cause of the pain. The pain impulse travels alongsensory fibers of the spinal nerves to the spinal cord and then to the brain, whichinterprets the degree and source of the pain. The brain can then signal nerve fibersto release chemicals to inhibit pain signals. Some of the chemicals\u2014enkephalins,serotonin, and endorphins\u2014are able to suppress pain signals and provide endoge-nous pain control. Visceral pain is pain from an organ secondary to surgery, cramp-ing, ischemia, stretching, or spasms. Referred pain is the sensation of pain comingfrom another part of the body than where it actually originates. It is common forheart pain to be felt in the arm, jaw, or back. The pain impulses from the hearttravel the same circuit as the receptors in these areas, confusing the interpretationin the brain.Key Terms Adjuvant addiction 1 2 34 5 6Learning Objectives537 CHAPTER 15 Pain Management Various individuals can experience different levels of pain with the same injury. Researchers have sought to explain this phenomenon. The gate control theory pos- tulates that there is a \"gate\" in the spine which controls the impulses from the fingeron the hot stove to the brain. The brain controls this gate to allow total or partial sig-nals through. However, the interpretation is based on current emotions, memories,expectations, ideals, and cultural biases. If your mind is busy elsewhere, the painmay be somehow lessened, for example, the Lamaze experience through labor andchildbirth. This is one of the more popular pain theories, among others. Emotional pain can produce many symptoms, as varied in their presentation as the etiology of the pain. Pain scales are useful tools to assess severity of pain and quality of life. They will help the patient to accurately assess the pain and the impact it is having. Painscales often are measured on a Likert scale, from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst painever). The Wong pain scale for children, uses a happy smiling face to a sad, tear-ful one. Another useful tool is a pain diary, in which the patient records severity,location, activity at the time, precipitating factors, and what, if anything, relievedthe pain. It is a helpful tool to asses worsening or alleviating pain and also reac-tions to pain medications. Just the Facts Acute Pain Acute pain usually points to an aberration or an illness. It is differentiated fromchronic pain by the duration, usually less than 4 to 6 months. WHAT WENT WRONG Pain nerves are stimulated by pressure, cuts, heat, cold, stabs, surgery, and so on.Other causes include fractures, burns, and bruises. PROGNOSIS Acute pain is usually able to be managed and terminated in less than 4 to 6 months.1538 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Intense sharp pain (severe) Fleeting, momentary, or ongoing Cramping, spasmotic INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Ultrasound.

Use of pain medication, timing, and side effects. Use of alternative therapies. Chronic Pain Chronic pain is lingering pain after identification of etiology of the initial onset. It may be less intense after 4 to 6 months, or may be the same degree of pain. WHAT WENT WRONG? Arthritis Backaches Cancer Headaches Neurogenic pain Psychogenic pain PROGNOSIS Prognosis for chronic pain is poor. Adjuvant modalities may help ease the long-term effects of chronic pain.2541 CHAPTER 15 Pain Management HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS In addition to the above, other manifestations may include: Anger Decreased mobility Decreased energy Depression Restlessness or anxiety Tense muscles INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate may be elevated.

Physical therapy.542 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified Massage. Deep breathing and meditation. Biofeedback. Peripheral Neuropathy This is the degeneration or disease of the peripheral nerves that affect motor and/or sensory nerves. The peripheral nerves include all but the brain and spinalcord. WHAT WENT WRONG? The neuropathies are poorly understood. When peripheral nerves are damaged,the brain becomes confused when processing communication from the damagednerves. Pain or numbness may be out of proportion to the damage or may be pres-ent where skin and tissue are intact. Peripheral neuropathy may affect motor nerves,sensory nerves, or both. It is often a sequelae (secondary result) of poorly con-trolled diabetes, autoimmune diseases, hypothyroidism, toxic substances, HIV/AIDS,vitamin deficiencies, alcohol abuse, or some infections. PROGNOSIS Treating the underlying disease state may help to relieve the pain. Often, treatingthe pain is the best option. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Symptoms result from pressure on the nerve or damage to the nerve, either sen-sory or motor. Pain. Numbness. Tingling. Muscle weakness.3543 CHAPTER 15 Pain Management Loss of sensation. Burning. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS History and physical. Reflexes. Sensation. Muscle strength. EMG\u2014electomyography.

Medications, timing, and side effects. Substance Use Disorders Substance abuse is defined as an irresistable urge for drugs, alcohol, or other substances, including physical, physiological, and psychological longings, anda need for more and greater dosages to satisfy the cravings. Abused substancesproduce euphoria and intoxication, which include changes in mental status,decreased coordination, and slurred speech. Seizures and loss of consciousnessare late signs. Usual abused substances include alcohol, club or illegal drugs,and cigarettes. However, food, caffeine, and sex may be included in some def-initions.5546 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified WHAT WENT WRONG? Research shows a varied set of internal and external circumstances leading to drug abuse. There seems to be a genetic factor involved, as well as environmental andsocial elements. Individuals may slowly begin a habit for pleasure, depression,hunger issues, weight reduction, societal pressures, or to escape from pressure.Teen use often begins early. PROGNOSIS Prognosis depends on the drug, its potency, the duration of usage, and genetic fac-tors of the user. Research shows that a history of prolonged abuse changes somebrain functions, leading to increased cravings. Substance use disorders may startwith one substance and may progress to others; for example, it is not uncommonto begin with marijuana and progress to cocaine or heroin. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Removing oneself from sports, work, and friends Decrease in grades, interest in school Irritability, depression Stealing money to support habit Hangovers Forgetfulness from effects of drug on the brain Fever Epistaxis from nasal administration, snorting Pain at injection sites Tremors Chest pain Abdominal pain Discolored, dark urine Tobacco: Heart disease Lung cancer547 CHAPTER 15 Pain Management Emphysema Peptic ulcers Stroke Alcohol: Depression Slurred speech Diminished coordination Decreased inhibitions Irregular heartbeat Anxiety Seizures Liver failure Cannabis (marijuana): Diminished memory and coordination Progression to harsher drugs Stimulants/amphetamines (cocaine, methedrine, ecstasy, methylphenidate, phenmetrazine, methamphetamines): Change in pupil size Paranoia Heart damage Hyperactivity Tachycardia Hypertension Stroke Psychoses Coma Opioids/narcotics (heroin, opium): Change in pupil Bradypnea HIV/AIDs Designer/club drugs:548 Medical-Surgical Nursing Tachycardia Delusions Paranoia Inhalants (aerosols, solvents, gasoline, lighter fluid, paint thinners, cleaning fluids): Euphoria Confusion Hallucinations Memory loss V omiting INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS For alcoholism, several screening tests are available to assess for dependency. TheCAGE screening test is commonly used:549 CHAPTER 15 Pain Management 1. Have you ever felt you should Cut down on your drinking? 2. Have you ever felt Annoyed by others questioning your drinking? 3. Has your drinking ever made you feel Guilty? 4. Do you need a drink first thing in morning for an Eye-opener? In addition, the following tests may be performed. Blood alcohol levels. Screening tests for drug use: Blood work. Urinalysis. TREATMENTS Those treatments for alcohol abuse that include behavior modification seem to be the most effective. Often, a combination of behavior modification, support group,and/or medication may be needed. ABCs of emergency support\u2014airway, breathing, circulation. Inpatient facilities. Outpatient settings. Counseling. Support groups. Abstinence. Behavior modification. Activated charcoal. Toxicity medications: For fomepizole NURSING DIAGNOSES Ineffective denial. Hopelessness. Altered family processes: alcoholism. Ineffective individual coping. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Prevent relapse. Instruct the patient: Adopt strategies to cope with cravings. Use of medication. Physical symptoms of withdrawal. Benefit of attendance at group sessions. Drug Addiction Drug addiction is the chronic overuse and abuse of legal or illegal substances causing interpersonal, social, and family problems. Addiction occurs when the useof the substance causes an abnormal physical or psychological dependence inwhich the sudden discontinuance will cause severe trauma. This differs from tol-erance in which the desired effectiveness of the drug diminishes over time. Largerquantities of the drug must be used to achieve the same effect. Severe addictionis usually characterized by the inability to carry out work requirements, schoolresponsibilities, or family obligations and duties.6551 CHAPTER 15 Pain Management WHAT WENT WRONG? Some patients who take pain medications other than directed or to achieve a sen- sation different than pain relief are more at risk for addiction. Addiction is a multi-faceted problem caused by peer pressure, genetic factors, social nonconformity,stress, depression, and mental anxiety. Those who have a family member with anaddiction or who have themselves had an addiction in the past are at an increasedrisk. Societal pressures and environmental pressures can influence the probabilityof becoming addicted. Research has determined that long-term drug use results inchanges in brain function, which increases the compulsion to abuse drugs. PROGNOSIS People of all ages, young ones in particular, are dying in unprecedented numbersbecause of their addictions. Most of the deaths are due to addiction to diverted pre-scription analgesics, alcohol, and benzodiazepines. Since addiction is such a multi-faceted problem, treatment prognosis varies greatly. Relapses, unfortunately, arefrequent. Studies have shown that females and older patients respond better totreatment programs and have fewer relapses. The greatest incidence of drug addic-tion occurs in males between the ages of 18 and 25. Active participation in a treat-ment program increases the chances of success. HALLMARK SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Tachycardia Dilated pupils Restlessness Weight loss due to poor appetite Hypervigilance Euphoria Death due to overdose INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS Urinalysis for initial diagnoses and to monitor compliance; will determinesubstance and toxicity. Blood tests will identify the drug used up to 12 hours before testing552 Medical-Surgical Nursing Demystified TREATMENTS ABCs of emergency support\u2014airway, breathing, circulation. Referral to a specialist in substance abuse. Behavioral therapy (counseling, cognitive therapy, and/or psychotherapy). Avoidance of situations detrimental to well-being. Residential programs. Outpatient programs. Acupuncture. Biofeedback. NURSING DIAGNOSES Altered family process Social isolation Risk for loneliness NURSING INTERVENTIONS Assess for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and hepatitis. Different approaches work for different people. Drug abuse is a result of multiple issues and treatment must address all ofthese issues. Explain to the patient: Disease process. Long-term treatment is more effective. Benefit of continued counseling. Treatment, medications, and side effects.553 CHAPTER 15 Pain Management Detoxification. Benefit of avoidance of high-risk behaviors. Recovery process is a long-term commitment. Strategies for coping. Prevention strategies. Crucial Diagnostic Test Urine Toxicology Screening This test detects the presence of drugs in the urine. Urine screening is preferred to blood screening because urine samples contain the substance for several daysafter its use, whereas blood levels diminish after several hours. Hair and nail sam-ples may also be required for certain tests. The test is done to detect commonlyused drugs, such as alcohol, the informed consent if the specimen is needed for medical/ legal purposes. Urine specimen collection must be monitored to ensure the speci-men has not been altered in any way.
