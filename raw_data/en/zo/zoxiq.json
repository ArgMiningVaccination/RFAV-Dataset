Photos by Carlos Puma. Irvine, Calif. \u2014 More than 3,000 participants, donors and supporters who joined the 2022 UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge on Oct. 8 helped raise $1 million for innovative cancer research. All proceeds will support promising cancer pilot projects and early-phase clinical trials at the [UCI Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center](/medical-services/cancer-center), the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center based in Orange County. Through a special partnership with Children's Health of Orange County (CHOC), a portion of the funds will be dedicated to pediatric cancer research. The record-breaking fundraiser greatly exceeded the peer-to-peer campaign total for 2021. In the previous five years of the annual ride, run and walk event, UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge participants had raised a total of $2.6 million for cancer research, which helped to jumpstart research that has garnered an additional $21.9 million in extramural grants awarded to UCI investigators. \"I am grateful for the overwhelming support we've received from our participants, donors and sponsors this year,\" said [Richard A. Van Etten, MD, PhD](/find-a-doctor/v/richard-van-etten), the cancer center's director and [UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge](https://cancer.uci.edu/research/uci-anti-cancer-challenge-research) founder. \"The support of our community and collaboration between more than 200 UCI researchers working tirelessly to conduct promising cancer research propels us closer toward our goal of preventing, treating and curing all forms of the disease.\" Event costs are underwritten by sponsors, ensuring that 100% of the funds raised by participants goes directly toward the cause. This year's sponsors included LA Fitness, Club Studio, the Kay Family Foundation, Hensel Phelps, KTLA, the Anaheim Ducks, Dunkin', Standard Drywall, Enclos, GSK, Bristol Meyers Squibb and Helio Genomics. Held in person at Aldrich Park on the university campus in Irvine for the first time since 2019, riders arrived at 6 a.m. to prepare for the 14-, 35-, 60- and 100-mile bike routes. Each group was welcomed by UCI leadership including Van Etten, [Michael J. Stamos, MD, dean of the UCI School of Medicine](/find-a-doctor/s/michael-stamos), and UCI Health CEO Chad Lefteris. At the start of the 5K and 10K run/walks, country recording artist Rick Monroe sang the national anthem. He was joined by KTLA reporter and Orange County bureau chief Chip Yost, who served as emcee for the 2022 UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge opening ceremony. The event also included a family-oriented festival hosted by UCI Health, where representatives of the [UCI Alpha Clinic](https://clinic.stemcell.uci.edu/), the Herbert Eye Institute](/medical-services/susan-samueli-integrative-health-institute) and the [Digestive Health Institute](/medical-services/digestive-health-institute) connected with participants and shared information about their services. During an awards ceremony following the activities, [Andrew Edwards](/blog/2022/09/prostate-cancer-free-11-years-after-surgery), founder and owner of the Anaheim Hills Saddle Club, was honored along with [Dr. Thomas Ahlering](/find-a-doctor/a/thomas-ahlering), a [UCI Health urologic cancer surgeon](/medical-services/urology/urologic-cancer), for their dedication and support of cancer research. Ronit Benjamin, volunteer chair of the 2022 UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge and its top individual fundraiser, called her involvement with the Anti-Cancer Challenge the last four years \"truly soul-fulfilling,\" adding, \"By honoring my father-in-law and grandparents, I'm helping others to live or have a better quality of life. Every word we speak and every action we perform affects our future, so I encourage everyone to join and make a difference!\" Jennifer Sarrail, executive director of the UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge, expressed gratitude for the overwhelming community support. \"We are grateful to each and every person who joined us for this year's event, and we would like to especially highlight our Partners in Research for their generosity and support,\" she said.

This year's Partners in Research include Team Benjamin & Wagner, Team Grandma Marcia, Monster Energy Cares, Lynn Capouya, Team Michelle & friends and Hensel Phelps. With the $1 million raised this year, the UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge funds will continue to support new projects that help investigators generate crucial preliminary findings that can lead to new breakthroughs in cancer treatment, like a [new molecular compound that can block the spread of melanoma](/blog/2022/06/uci-dermatologist-seeks-genetic-switch-to-stop-cancers) created in the lab of [UCI Health physician-scientist Anand K.
