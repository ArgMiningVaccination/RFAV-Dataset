Matt Truppo Head of Global Research Platforms mRNA and the Future of Vaccines and Medicines Research-enabling technologies Technologies are part of our rich ecosystem, which is built on patient insights, lasting alliances, and a unique capacity to deliver for patients and communities everywhere. SYNTHORIN Molecules By expanding the genetic alphabet, we can design and optimize protein-based treatments in ways that were previously impossible. Antibody-Drug Conjugates We're designing antibodies that act like a GPS, guiding anti-cancer drugs to a protein on tumor cells. Natural Killer Cells The precision of natural killer cells helps us create new immunotherapies to help the body fight cancer. Genomic medicine Our integrated genomic medicine unit is accelerating progress toward gene and cell therapies by combining an array of techniques, from nucleic acid nanostructures to viral and non-viral gene-delivery platforms. Artificial intelligence Our partnerships with leading-edge data science companies Owkin and Exscientia give our teams access to unique AI platforms. NANOBODY\u00ae Molecules At a tenth the size of conventional antibodies, NANOBODY\u00ae molecules have the potential to reach disease targets in the human body that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. TAILORED COVALENCY With this revolutionary chemistry, a \"double lock and key\" mechanism makes it possible to design small molecules with limited ability to interact with off-target molecules. mRNA We're using mRNA with the goal of developing new, life-saving vaccines and to address long-standing challenges in cancer, immune-mediated diseases, and rare diseases. The possibilities for implementing and combining technologies are endless. Our work is extremely collaborative. A scientist at the bench with an idea can reach out to colleagues with disease area knowledge, protein engineering expertise, or machine learning skills, to follow the concept through and test it out. It's empowering! Rebecca Sendak Global Head of Large Molecules Antibody engineering Our exclusive access to IGM Bio's immunology platform lets us create, develop, manufacture, and commercialize a new class of antibodies that could overcome the limitations of conventional IgG antibodies. Multi-specific antibodies Proprietary technologies allow our teams to develop antibodies that recognize two or three different targets. By combining key features of several different antibodies into a single therapy, we can tackle cancers and immunological disorders on multiple fronts. siRNA Conjugates RNA interference helps us slow the production of disease-causing proteins. We're collaborating with Alnylam to harness this natural process in new therapies for rare blood disorders. Protein Degraders We're collaborating with Kymera and Nurix to develop advanced protein degrader therapies for people with challenging diseases. Conditional Biologics Proprietary \"masking\" technology helps us develop immunotherapies that overcome long-standing challenges with T-cell engagers. Monoclonal antibodies Rather than stimulating the body to produce its own antibodies, we can design monoclonal antibodies to offer immediate protection against certain diseases. This kind of rapid protection could bridge important gaps in immunity, especially among very young infants and other at-risk populations. We use monoclonal antibodies in our immunization for infants to combat RSV. Live-attenuated and recombinant protein vaccines Some vaccines are based on weakened whole viruses, which help the body build its defenses without causing disease. Sometimes only part of a pathogen, like a protein, is needed to create a vaccine. One approach is to synthesize that protein using recombinant technology and formulate it into a vaccine. Inactivated vaccines The polio, rabies, and most influenza vaccines are based on viruses that have been cultured in the lab and inactivated, or killed, before they are used. Polysaccharide-based vaccines Some disease-causing bacteria have a coating made of polysaccharides that protects them from being seen and destroyed by cells in our immune system. Using one of these sugars in the vaccine alerts the adult body to kill the bacteria. Conjugated-polysaccharide vaccines These vaccines help the body remember bacteria longer and can make children's immune response stronger. We use this approach to address meningitis and haemophilus influenza type B in infants. Explore more Page updated August 2023 "}
