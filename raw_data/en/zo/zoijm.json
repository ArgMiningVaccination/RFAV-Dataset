Gaslighting Addiction & Codependence Breaking the Cycle Intergenerational Trauma Dating Again Narcissistic Abuse Abusive Relationships Setting Boundaries Chronic Infidelity Learn to Trust Yourself Benefits Of Healing Toxic Relationships Learn how toxic relationships develop Like a frog in hot water, it's difficult to know that a relationship is toxic, until it's toxic. Learning to recognize subtle toxic relationship signs can help you see what was not obvious in the relationship, and give you tools to recognize when a relationship may not be good for you in the future. Develop a strong set of boundaries and learn how to sustain them. Boundaries are an essential function for safety in the world, even with those we love. In toxic relationships, either there is a lack of boundaries or a failure to respect them. Recognizing the boundaries that you need to keep yourself safe, and where you struggle in their maintenance, can make a world of difference in how you navigate relationships moving forward and ensure you choose partners who respect your needs and limits. Build innovative self-care strategies. Your first relationship is with yourself. Toxic relationships often leave people in a tailspin of fatigue and self-neglect. Self-care starts with your internal dialogue, your relationship to time, your ability to make sound decisions, and assessment of your own needs. Breaking through old habits of overlooking or deprioritizing your own needs is necessary in establishing healthy relationships with others in the future. Break old patterns in relationships. Every person enters into their adult life with certain, automatic and unconscious, ways of seeking and engaging in romantic relationships. Examining the role you play in relationships can give you tremendous understanding of toxic relationship psychology and how to avoid getting stuck in future relationships that do not serve you. Heal a broken heart. The pain that can come with ending a toxic relationship can feel devastating. The love you felt for your partner was real, even if the relationship hurt. Grieving what was lost, what could have been, and what may never be takes time and support. Give yourself the gift of healing and giving all of your emotions the space to be valid. Restore resilience for your mind and body. In the wake of a toxic, abusive, or unhealthy relationship, your mind and body feel the impact. Negative or intrusive thoughts, nightmares, fear, shame, and other feelings can deplete your physical strength, affect your appetite and sleep routine, and become a vicious cycle that is difficult to step out of. Building resilience can help you get traction back in your life, and establish peace for your mind and body. FREE 30 MIN INITIAL CONSULTATION... Frequently Asked Questions Why do I repeat the same pattern in relationships? It's no secret that how we are raised shapes the way we love as adults. Learning about your relational blind spots and automatic responses to certain kinds of affection, can be the first step to healing the old wounds and unmet needs, giving you power to recognize and step out of those patterns. How will I know if I am ready to date again? Readiness is a personal benchmark. Dating comes with risks for rejection, heartbreak, disappointment, etc. As you heal from toxic relationships, your ability to tolerate those risks will rebound, and you will have some new tools to help you along the way, after taking this course. Each person's path is different, but the Healing from Toxic Relationships course can help you decide how and when to put yourself out there again. I feel crazy, and I don't know what is true anymore. How can I learn to trust myself again? Gaslighting and manipulation are frequent flyers in toxic relationships. Emotional abuse tactics like these can often separate someone from their inherent sense of knowing. Learning the cues of your body and how to listen to your intuition in a different way can help you begin repairing a sense of trust in your own assessment and judgments and help you on the path to healing from toxic relationships. Do I have to leave the toxic relationship to participate in this program? No, this course can help you assess what is in your power to change in the toxic relationship, and whether or not that will work for you. Learning how to heal toxic relationships, set and maintain healthy boundaries, practice the art of effective self-care, and see old patterns emerging, can help you and your partner get ahead of unhealthy traps and stay aligned, pending your partner is also invested in growth. How can I forgive myself for getting involved in a toxic relationship? Self-compassion after a toxic relationship can feel out of reach. People often blame themselves for the hurt they experience, saying things like, \"I should have known better,\" or \"I saw the red flags and I stayed.\" Unmet needs, often from childhood, carry over into adult relationships, and predispose people to tolerating certain kinds of affection. Understanding the reasons you stayed in the toxic relationship, and reframing them as once useful adaptive strategies, can help you turn self-blame into self-love and compassion. I want to do this course, but I am exhausted. Will it really help? This course is built to help you honor your body and mind in a way that may be uncomfortable at times, and also rejuvenating. Validation, knowledge, and practical skills can help you establish peace of mind, resources for healing, and the support of a community of others that have made it through similar kinds of pain. "}
