Pharmacology Duration: Unknown These products convey active immunity via stimulation of production of endogenously produced antibodies The onset of protection from disease is relatively slow, but duration is long lasting (years) Mechanism of Action Antigenic capsular polysaccharides haemoph b poly conj-tet tox-PF NAME(S): Acthib, Hibtiter helps protect young children from Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection. Hib is a bacterial infection that can cause serious illness, including brain infection (meningitis). Children younger than age 5 are at highest risk for infection. Vaccination is the best way to protect against this life-threatening disease. Vaccines work by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies).This vaccine is not usually used by children over the age of 4 or in adults.
