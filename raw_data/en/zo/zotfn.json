Cosmetic chemists explain the 20 toxic ingredients to avoid in your beauty products.", "sitename": "Byrdie", "date": "2020-01-21", "cleaned_text": "When it comes to our beauty products, it might seem as though the list of ingredients to avoid is growing longer by the minute\u2014but that's not to say you should demonize every ingredient brought up. Marketing has a lot to do with it, and new science comes out all the time, offering evidence-based information about what is and isn't good for your skin. Then, of course, there are personal differences too. What may cause sensitivity for you might work for someone else. It's all about education, transparency, and nuance. Still, getting to know your ingredient labels is important. \"A study by EWG notes that a woman applies about 168 different chemicals every day,\" Yashi Shrestha, the green cosmetic chemist behind clean beauty retailer [NakedPoppy](https://nakedpoppy.com/) says. \"This exposure accumulates over time, and so it is important for people to opt for products that are cleaner and better for our health.\" But thanks to a slow-evolving industry, this is often an uphill battle. \"Unfortunately, cosmetics and personal care products have little government oversight, which means many products, and the ingredients used in today's beauty products, are not well-regulated,\" Shrestha explains. And as cosmetic chemist Ginger King adds, \"There is really no legal definition of clean or non-toxic,\" says King. \"Most of the standards are made up by retailers.\" This ultimately leaves the responsibility to the consumer to know what's good for them and what's not. And if you've ever tried to discern the seven-syllable words on an ingredient label, you know this is hardly an easy task. But the good news? \"Consumers are becoming more conscious about the environmental impact of certain ingredients, and clean beauty is evolving to have more visibility into the supply chain and sourcing of ingredients,\" notes Shrestha. That's a beauty trend we can definitely get behind\u2014and in the meantime, consider this your ultimate cheat sheet on the ingredients to consider avoiding. Meet the Expert - Yashi Shrestha is the research scientist and green cosmetic chemist behind clean beauty retailer [NakedPoppy](https://nakedpoppy.com/). - Ginger King is a cosmetic scientist and the founder and CEO of [Grace Kingdom Beauty](https://www.gracekingdombeauty.com), a cosmetic product development company. Toxic Ingredients to Avoid Formaldehyde: Despite decades of research that classifies formaldehyde as a known carcinogen, it's still a fairly common ingredient in hair straightening products, nail polish, eyelash glue, and an array of other cosmetics. Thankfully, [some retailers](https://cdn3.ewg.org/sites/default/files/u352/EWG_Toxic20List_C02.pdf?_ga=2.129370252.1082401130.1579063494-1573272382.1579063494) (including Whole Foods, CVS, and Target) are starting to ban products that contain formaldehyde from their shelves. But there's a catch. \"While formaldehyde has become a well-known toxic ingredient to avoid in beauty products, many don't know about the lesser known ingredients that release formaldehyde which are formulated in cosmetics today,\" says Shrestha. In other words, while it's unlikely that you'll see the word \"formaldehyde\" on an ingredient label, it might be hiding behind another name. Formaldehyde releases: \"Bronopol, DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl preservatives that slowly form formaldehyde,\" says Shrestha. So steer clear if you can. Synthetic fragrances: A heads-up: When an ingredient label simply says \"fragrance\" or \"parfum,\" it's often an umbrella term for hundreds of chemicals that brands aren't required to disclose. (That makes it a heck of a lot harder to discern what may cause a reaction.) Phthalates: One such sneaky compound hiding under the \"fragrance\" umbrella? That would be phthalates, which are sometimes used to help perfume stick to skin, as well as eyelash adhesive and nail polish. That's bad news because phthalates [have been shown](https://nakedpoppy.com/pages/no-list) to be pretty significant endocrine disruptors\u2014in some cases facilitating early puberty in girls and boys, and reduced sperm count in men. Oh, and did we mention they're also harmful to the environment? The EWG [reports](https://www.ewg.org/sites/default/files/u352/EWG_Toxic20List_C02.pdf?_ga=2.129370252.1082401130.1579063494-1573272382.1579063494) that some retailers have started to ban phthalate-containing products from their shelves, but we still recommend a healthy dose of skepticism when it comes to added fragrance. Polyethylene glycol (PEGs): On a similar and [butylene glycol](https://www.byrdie.com/butylene-glycol-for-skin-4774849) (BG) could potentially be petroleum derived and irritating to the skin,\" says Shrestha. These are chemical thickeners and can sometimes be found in cream-based products. Siloxanes: Also known as cyclical silicones, these compounds are found in a variety of cosmetic and skincare products\u2014but they're not great for the environment, and have been linked with endocrine disruption as well. (Dimethicone, on the other hand, is considered safer when used sparingly.) Triclosan: This antimicrobial ingredient (often found in hand sanitizers and antibacterial soap) has been linked to such a significant impact on the thyroid and reproductive hormones that it's banned in several countries. The US has banned it from antiseptic soap, but it might still show up in deodorant, mouthwash, shaving cream, and toothpaste, says the EWG. Ethanolamines: While these compounds (which are emulsifiers found in foundation, mascara, and skincare products) are technically classified as safe for cosmetic use by the EWG, they're also shown to be allergens\u2014something to keep in mind if you have sensitivities to certain ingredients. They might be listed as monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), or [triethanolamine](https://www.byrdie.com/triethanolamine-for-skin-4777052) (TEA). Oxybenzone: A potential endocrine disruptor, oxybenzone can be found in many skincare products that contain sunscreen, \"including lotions, lip balms, cleansers, fragrance, and even baby products,\" says Shrestha. Octinoxate: This common sunscreen ingredient was thought originally to be harmful to coral reefs, and although that may have been recently proven false, it's still somewhat irritating to sensitive skin. Homosalate: \"This is another chemical that's commonly used in sunscreens as a UV absorber,\" says Shrestha. While regulations are starting to wisen up to octinoxate and oxybenzone, homosalate is still pretty commonly used. Read your labels! Toluene: This chemical (which also goes by the name of Butylated Hydroxytoluene, or BHT), is a big no-no: It's linked with brain toxicity and can be especially dangerous during pregnancy. While it's banned in the EU and Southeast Asia (as well as by a few retailers in the US), you can still find it in nail polish, nail treatments, and hair dye. Talc: While talcum powder (often used as a smoothing agent in mineral makeup) is generally safe, it also has the potential to be contaminated with asbestos, which is a known carcinogen and instigator of lung disease. Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAs) and Perfluorochemicals (PFCs): Remember how we said that the term \"fragrance\" can potentially be hiding hundreds of chemicals? Well, [PFAs](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/topics/pfas/index.html?) are a class of thousands. \"They're fluorinated chemicals that have been found in sunscreens, hair products, and shaving creams,\" says Shrestha. \"They're linked to serious health effects, including cancer, thyroid disease, and even reduced effectiveness of vaccines.\" If you commonly use waterproof mascara or eyeliner, take note: PFCs are big culprits here because they're water repellents. Teflon: Teflon is one specific PFA worth calling out\u2014it's the brand name for Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and is sometimes added to cosmetics to improve the texture. But like other PFAs, it's linked to hormone disruption and reproductive issues. Resorcinol: \"This common ingredient in hair color and bleaching products has been linked to skin irritation and immune system dysfunction,\" says Shrestha. \"In animal studies, resorcinol can disrupt normal thyroid function.\" Carbon black: The EWG has flagged this pigment (which is often found in mascara and eyeliner) because of its possible link to cancer with regard to inhalation (not topical application). For what it's worth, the FDA has put some limits on the amounts used\u2014but it's still widely found in cosmetics at retailers everywhere. Parabens: \"Butyl, propyl, and ethyl parabens have been linked to hormone disruption,\" notes Shrestha. These are preservatives that are found in a variety of cosmetics and are probably the most well-known ingredient to avoid due to a 2004 research paper that appeared to find traces of parabens in breast cancer tissue samples. According to EU and [FDA regulations](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/parabens-cosmetics), parabens in their current form are officially considered safe to use, since cosmetic products only use a very small concentration of these ingredients in their formulas (up to around 0.4 percent, though measurements do differ for each [paraben](https://www.byrdie.com/what-are-parabens)). It's important to note, however, that parabens may be irritating to some with sensitive skin. Hydroquinone: This one may surprise you, but the safe use of the hyperpigmentation savior has long been debated, with some countries banning it for its potential carcinogenicity. \" [Hydroquinone](https://www.byrdie.com/is-hydroquinone-safe) is cytotoxic,\" explains King. \"It kills the cells, thus great for skin brightening, but it has been banned.\" This Is Not About Fear Knowledge is power\u2014and you can feel good about taking steps to better understand exactly what you're putting on your body. Think of this list as a jumping-off point for anyone curious about learning more about sketchy ingredients and clean beauty as whole. We recommend doing your own research on all of the ingredients above, then making a decision that feels right for you. \"Given the lack of regulations and federal oversight on what ingredients are allowed in beauty products, it's important for consumers to seek out and demand products that are clean,\" says Shrestha. \"This not only drives innovation for brands creating better products, but also increases accountability so that consumers don't have to spend time doing research on ingredients to ensure safety.\" In other words, get comfortable calling brands on their BS\u2014all in the name of a safer beauty industry for all.
