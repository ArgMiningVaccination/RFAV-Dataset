It employs spiritual healing methods which expand the awareness of the energy healer and uses energy, colour and light healing techniques to catalyse healing in the person's energy field (aura and chakra system)\u2014helping the patient break free from afflictions and limitations of body, mind and spirit. It may provide enhanced quality of life for the person, and facilitate spiritual growth. As no two people are exactly alike, each treatment is tailored to the specific requirements of the client. During a treatment the practitioners' hands are placed in the aura or gently on the body to remove congestions accumulated there, to restructure the energy anatomy and regulate the flows of the field, and to facilitate the person's ability to metabolise energy in a balanced and sustainable manner. The client's own healing mechanisms are activated and they proceed at their own pace. The practitioner works with heightened sensory perception including touch, light and energy channelled in a unique and individual way for each client. What are the most common referring complaints? Anxiety, altered mood and sleeping problems Often anxiety which just doesn't seem to have a specific cause can lead to mood disorders, excessive stress or the feeling no being able to cope and ongoing fatigue and are common health complaints. Many clients want to use natural medicine or treatments rather than allopathic medicine to avoid side effects and to feel more in control of their own health and well-being. Anxiety is nearly always responsible for the chronic elevation of our sympathetic nervous system response or the \"fight-or-flight\", this is switched on all the time causing inappropriate release of the stress hormone cortisol which in turn depletes our adrenal system. To address this we need to treat the underlying cause and to correct this state of feeling \"wired and tired' which is intrinsically linked with anxiety poor sleeping habits, inability to relax and often headaches. Anxiety responds well to energy work and is often treated integratively with herbal or natural medicine to optimise results. My approach in assist clients to manage their own responses with vibrational & energy medicine & breathing techniques allowing them to experience a deeper awareness of body-mind which enables them to recognize and switch off these reactions.
