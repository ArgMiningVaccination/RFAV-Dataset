In this review, we summarize cur rent research progress on mRNA vaccines, which have the potential to be quick-manuf actured and to become powerfultoolsagainstinfectiousdiseaseandwehighlight thebrightfutureoftheirdesign and applications. Keywords: mRNA vaccine, infectious disease, delivery, mechan ism, application INTRODUCTION Vaccination is the most successful medical approach to disease prevention and control. The successful development and use of vaccines has saved thousan ds of lives and large amounts of money. In the future, vaccines have the potential to be used no t only against infectious diseases but also for cancer as a prophylactic and treatment tool, and fo r elimination of allergens ( 1-3). Priortothe1980s,vaccinesweredevelopedforprotectionaga instdisease-causingmicroorganisms. Empirically,inactivatedvaccineswereproducedbyheatorch emicaltreatment,andliveattenuated vaccines were generally developed in animals, cell lines or un favorable growth conditions. During vaccine development, the mechanisms involved in conf erring immunity were unknown. Nevertheless, the use of live attenuated or killed whole org anism-based vaccines had enormous success in the control and eradication of a number of severe h uman infectious diseases, including smallpox, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and animal infectio us disease, such as classic swine fever, cattle plague, and equine infectious anemia. More rece ntly, live attenuated (LAV), subunit and peptide based vaccines have been developed thanks to advanc ements in molecular biology theory and technologies. The results obtained with LAV vacc ination dramatically expanded our knowledge of the mechanisms related to the immune response el icited by these vaccines. For inactivatedvaccines,antigen-specicantibodieslargely contributetothepreventionandcontrolof microbe-initiatedinfectiousdisease.Inadditiontospeci chumoralimmuneresponses.LAVselicit strong cellular immune responses, which are critical to eradi cate many intracellular pathogens.

Notably, for most emerging and re- emerging devastating infectious diseases, the main obstac le is obtaining a stockpile in a short timeframe ( 10). Non-viral delivered nucleic acid-based vaccines can ll the gap betwee n a disease epidemic and a desperately needed vaccine ( 10). Non-viral delivered nucleic acids are categorized as DNA or RNA according to their type of 5-carbon sugar. From being administrated to antigen expression, DNA vaccine and RNA vaccines are processed through dierent pathways. In the steps between immunization with a DNA template and expression of the target antigen, the DNA has to overcome the cytoplasmic membrane and nuclear membrane, be transcribed into mRNA, and move back into the cytoplasm and initiate translation (refer to Figure1). Although promising and with shown safety,well-tolerabilityandimmunogenicity,DNAvaccin eswere characterized by suboptimal potency in early clinical trials (11). Enhanced delivery technologies, such as electroporation , have increased the ecacy of DNA vaccines in humans ( 12), but have not reduced the potential risk of integration of exogenous DNA into the host genome, which may cause severe mutagenesis and induced new diseases ( 13,14). Since naked in vitrotranscribed mRNA was found to be expressed in vivo after direct injection into mouse muscle, mRNA has been investigatedextensivelyasapreventiveandtherapeuticplat form (15-19).DuetothedramaticdevelopmentofRNA-basedvaccine studies and applications, a plethora of mRNA vaccines have entered into clinical trial ( 19). Comparatively, mRNA vaccines confer several advantages over viral vectored vaccines and DNA vaccines (summary in Table1). The utilization of RNA as a therapeutic tool is not the focus of this manuscript and hasbee n extensively reviewed elsewhere ( 2,19,20). In this review, we provide highlights on mRNA vaccines as promising tools in the preventionandcontrolofinfectiousdisease. CONCEPTION AND FORMS OF mRNA VACCINES mRNA vaccines were reported to be eective for direct gene transfer for the rst time by Wo et al. ( 15). Currently, two forms of mRNA vaccines have been developed: conventional mRNA vaccines and self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which are derived from positive strand RNA viruses. Although mRNA vaccines were rst tested in the early 1990s, these vaccines were not initially extensively utilized due to concerns abo ut their fragile stability caused by omnipresent ribonuclease s and small-scale production. Initial demonstration that mRNA stability can be improved by optimization and formulation was published by Ross and colleagues in 1995 ( 21). Since that time, studies on mRNA vaccines have exploded and mRNA can now be synthetically produced, through a cell- free enzymatic transcription reaction. The in vitrotranscription reaction includes a linearized plasmid DNA encoding the mRNA vaccine, as a template, a recombinant RNA polymerase,and nucleoside triphosphates as essential components. A cap structure is enzymatically added to the transcriptional prod uct at the end of the reaction or as a synthetic cap analog in a sing le step procedure. Finally, a poly(A) tail will be provided to form a maturemRNAsequence. Conventional mRNA vaccines include in their simplest an ORF for the target antigen, flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs)andwithaterminalpoly(A)tail.Aftertransfection,t hey drive transient antigen expression. In addition to conventi onal vaccines, there is another mRNA vaccine platform based on the genomeofpositivestrandviruses,mostcommonlyalphaviruses . These mRNA vaccines are based on an engineered viral genome containing the genes encoding the RNA replication machinery whereas the structural protein sequences are replaced with th e gene of interest (GoI) and the resulting genomes are referre d as replicons. These vaccines are named self-amplifying mRNA and are capable of directing their self-replication, through synthesis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, generating multiple copies of the antigen-encoding mRNA, and express high levels of the heterologous gene when they are introduced into the cytoplasm of host cells, in a way that mimics production of antigens in vivoby viral pathogens, triggering both humoral and cellular immune responses ( 22- 27). Self-amplifying mRNA can be derived from the genomes of Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest mRNAs ( 9-11kb) are generated from the DNA template with similar procedures to those previously described for conventional mRNAs and RNA molecules can be produced at a large scale in vitro. After the puried RNA replicon is delivered into host cells, either as viral particles or as synthetically formulated RNA, it is translate d extensively and amplied by its encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.Comparedwiththerapidexpressionofconventional mRNAs,publishedresultshaveshownthatvaccinationwithsel f- amplifying mRNA vaccines results in higher antigen expression levels, although delayed in time, which persist for several day s in vivo.Equivalent protection is conferred but at a much lower RNA dose ( 31). Due to the lack of viral structural proteins, the replicondoesnotproduceinfectiousviralparticles.Addition ally, both conventional mRNA and self-amplifying mRNAs cannot potentially integrate into the host genome and will be degrad ed naturally during the process of antigen expression. These characteristics indicate that mRNA vaccines have the potenti al to be much safer than other vaccines and are a promising vaccineplatform. ENGINEERED mRNA WITH POTENT EFFICIENCY Stability and translation of mRNA is crucial for a successful RNA vaccine ( 32,33). In the process of translation, mRNA purity is critical to determine its stability and protein yiel d (34). Contamination with dsRNAs, derived from aberrant RNA polymerase activities, leads to the inhibition of translati on and degradation of cellular mRNA and ribosomal RNA, thus decreasing protein expression by interrupting the translatio n Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 594Zhang et al. mRNA Vaccine Against Infectious Diseases FIGURE 1 | The mechanisms of different nucleic acid vaccines, includi ng DNA vaccines, mRNA vaccines.

The removal of dsRNA can increase translation dramatically( 35).Excesscomponentsandshortordoublestrand RNAs(dsRNA)canberemovedbypurication.Initially,lithium chloride (LiCl) was used for this purpose, but it restricted th e industrialization of mRNA vaccines and it did not remove dsRNAs. Purication via fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) could be utilized to remove any remaining product and produce mRNA at a large scale and for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) processes ( 35-37). Non-coding sequence flanking 5 and 3terminal of open reading frame (ORF) is crucial for translation. The 5untranslated region, such as kozak sequence, or 5caps is required for ecient protein production ( 38-40). The 3untranslated region containing optimal poly(A) signal determined the stability of mRNA and increased protein translation ( 41-45). Additionally, codon optimization is a popular method to avoid rare codons with low utilization, to increase protein production, mRNA abundance and stability(46-49). mRNA vaccines are ecient at antigen expression, but sequence and secondary structures formed by mRNAs are recognized by a number of innate immune receptors, andTABLE 1 | Advantages and disadvantages of viral vectored vaccines, D NA vaccines and RNA vaccines.

Thanks to advancement in RNA biology understanding, several methods can be employed to increase the potency of mRNA vaccines, Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 594Zhang et al. mRNA Vaccine Against Infectious Diseases including sequence optimization and usage of modied nucleosides. Recognition from innate immune sensors can be avoided by incorporating modied nucleosides, such as pseudouridine in turns improve translation eciency ( 50-55). During the in vitrotranscription of mRNA, immature mRNA would be produced as contamination which inhibited translation through stimulating innate immune activation. FPLC and HPLC purication could tackle this problem( 35,37). Currently, most vaccines in use, with the exception of some animal vaccines, need to be transported and stored in an uninterrupted cold-chain process, which is prone to failure, especially in poor rural areas of tropical countries; these requirements are not being met by available eective vaccinestopreventandcontrolinfectiousdiseases.Theref ore,the development of thermostable vaccines has been gaining inter est. Optimization in formulation of synthetic mRNA vaccines have shown that it is possible to generate thermostable vaccines. The results described by Jones showed that freeze-dried mRNA with trehalose or naked mRNA is stable for at least 10 months at 4C. After being transfected, these mRNAs expressed high levels of proteins and conferred highly eective and long- lasting immunity in newborn and elderly animal models ( 56). Another lyophilized mRNA vaccine was shown to be stable at 5-25C for 36 months and 40C for 6 months ( 57). Stitz and colleagues showed that when a protamine-encapsulated conventional mRNA-based rabies virus vaccine was subjected to oscillating temperatures between 4 and 56C for 20 cycles and exposure 70C, its immunogenicity and protective eects were not compromised ( 58). Encapsulation of mRNA with cationic liposome or cell penetrating peptide (CPP) protected mRNA from degradation by RNase. These intriguing approaches would bediscussedindeliverymethods. RNA VACCINES IN THE PREVENTION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE During the last two decades, mRNA vaccines have been investigated extensively for infectious disease preventio n, and for cancer prophylaxis and therapy. Much progress has been made thus far ( 19,20). Cancer mRNA vaccines were designed toexpresstumor-associatedantigensthatstimulatecell-m ediated immune responses to clear or inhibit cancer cells ( 59). Most cancer vaccine are investigated more as therapeutics than prophylactics and have been reviewed elsewhere ( 20,60,61). mRNAvaccinesagainstinfectiousdiseasescouldbedeveloped as prophylactic or therapeutic. mRNA vaccines expressing antigen of infectious pathogen induce both strong and potent T cell and humoral immune responses ( 8,16,19). As previously described theproductionproceduretogeneratemRNAvaccinesisentirely cell-free, simple and rapid if compared to production of whole microbe, live attenuated and subunit vaccines. This fast an d simple manufacturing process makes mRNA a promising bio- product that can potentially ll the gap between emerging infectious disease and the desperate need for eective vaccin es.Producing RNA at a large scale to satisfy commercialization is the rst step toward making mRNA vaccines. Currently, all components needed for mRNA production are available at the GMP grade; however, some components are supplied at a limitedscale. A great deal of research has been initially conducted on the development of cancer mRNA vaccines and has demonstrated the feasibility of producing clinical grade in vitrotranscribed RNA(60).SeveralprojectsonmRNAvaccinesagainstinfectious disease have also been conducted, although clinical evaluat ion is still limited. For example, several RNA-based vaccine platfor ms have been utilized for the development of influenza vaccines. Several published results showed that RNA-based influenza vaccines induce a broadly protective immune response against not only homologous but also hetero-subtypic influenza viruses (62-66). Influenza mRNA vaccines hold great promises being an egg-free platform, and leading to production of antigen with high delity in mammalian cells. Recent published results demonstratedthatthelossofaglycosylationsitebyamutati onin thehemagglutinin(HA)oftheegg-adaptedH3N2vaccinestrai n resulted in poor neutralization of circulating H3N2 viruses in vaccinatedhumansandferrets.Incontrast,theprocessofmRNA vaccine production is egg-free, and mRNA-encoded proteins are properly folded and glycosylated in host cells after vaccin e administration, thus avoiding the risk of producing incorre ct antigens( 67,68). mRNA has also been used in the veterinary eld to prevent animal infectious diseases. Pulido et al. demonstrate d that immunization with in vitrotranscribed mRNA induced protection against foot and mouse disease virus in mice ( 69). Saxena and colleagues demonstrated that a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine encoding rabies virus glycoprotein induced an immune response and provided protection in mice and could potentially be used to prevent rabies in canine ( 70). Recently, VanBlargan et al. developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated modied mRNA vaccine encoding prM and E genes of deer powassan virus (POWV). This mRNA vaccine induced robust humoral immune response not only against POWV strains but also against the distantly related Langat virus ( 71). As described previously, modication of nucleosides and optimization of codons can avoid recognitio n by innate immune sensors to improve translation eciency. In Table2, studies conducted with nucleoside modied and non- modied mRNA vaccines for infectious disease are summarized (52,58,72-78). Besides being used as vaccine, mRNA could also be deployed for therapeutic purposes. Interestingly, a recent publication by Pardi and colleagues showed that the adnimistration of mRNA encoding the light and heavy chains of a broadly neutralizin g anti-HIV antibody encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) protectedhumanizedmicefromintravenousHIVchallenge( 79). The data suggest that the utilization of nucleoside-modied mRNA can be expanded for passive immunotherapy against (CMV), human papiloma virus, etc. Self- amplifying mRNA vaccines enable large amounts of prompt antigen expression and potent T cellular immune responses. In Table3, we summarize publications on self-amplifying mRNA Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 594Zhang et al. mRNA Vaccine Against Infectious Diseases TABLE 2 | Nucleoside modied or non-modied mRNA vaccines against infe ctious diseases.

For example, intravenous administration of unmodied naked mRNA resulted in rapid digestion by ribonucleases and stimulation of the innate immune response , but these limitations can be overcome by appropriate deliverysystems and mRNA modications ( 93). mRNA vaccines are administered via a systemic or local method based on antigen expression localization requirements. Direct intramuscula r (i.m), intradermal (i.d.) or subcutaneous injection of in vitro transcribed mRNA are the main delivery routes for mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases, while intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intravenous (i.v.) administration are employed when systemic expression of antigens of interest is needed, mostl y for therapeutic applications. Multiple reports have been recently publishedandshowedthatavarietyofantigenscanbeexpresse d with high eciency and induced potent humoral and cellular immune responses after mRNA vaccination. Lipid nanoparticles loaded with nucleoside modied conventional mRNA encoding refly luciferase have been used, for example, to Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 594Zhang et al. mRNA Vaccine Against Infectious Diseases examine the influence of route of administration on kinetics of antigen expression ( 94). i.m. and i.d. injections oered the best levels and duration of eect, with protein production peaking at 4h and maintained locally 8-10 days post injection, depending on the dose. Both i.m. and i.d. administration in Rhesus in LNP induced protective titers, but this response occurred more rapidly by i .d. administrationthanbyi.m.administration( 95). CV7201 is an mRNA vaccine candidate under development by CureVac AG. i.d. and i.m. injection ofCV7201 in mice and pigs induced potent humoral and T cell immune responses ( 77). In a phase I clinical trial, CV7201 showed long-term safety and immunogenicity against the rabies virus at alow dose. No dierences were observed in terms of safety between i.d and i.m. administration or between needle-syringe or needle-fr iters induced by CV7201 were evaluated, needle-free administrati on was superior to injection with a needle ( 57). In an influenza vaccinetest,theintranodal(i.n.)deliveryofnakedmRNAel icited potent CD4 and CD8T cell immune responses in mice, and repeated i.n. injection with modied mRNA led subcutaneous, i.d. administration did not ( 96). Combination with two or more delivery methods have been explored and employed in cancer mRNA vaccine development. The combination of i.v. and i.d. injection of TriMix-DC-MEL therapy showed favorable outcomes in patients with broad CD8 and CD4T cell immune responses ( 97). Further studies demonstrated that i.n. and intratumor injection with TriMix mRNA into dendritic cells achieved better therapeutic outcomes than alternate inject ion sites (98,99). However, i.d. administration of RNActive vaccines presentedasimilarimmuneresponsetothei.n.administratio nof conventional mRNA vaccines, which was an inconsistent resul t (100). Altogether, these results highlight the importance of the deliveryrouteforeectivemRNAvaccines. Similarly, Fleeton et al. showed that i.m. injection of in vitro transcribed naked self-amplifying mRNA based on the Semliki Forestvirusgenomecouldinduceaprotectiveimmuneresponse (62). Geall and colleagues showed that i.m. administration in mice and cotton rats with very low dose of self-amplifying mRNA encoding the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) encapsulated with a synthetic LNP induced very IgG1 and interferon (IFN)-producing CD4 and CD8T cells(22). Delivery tools are equally important in the eectiveness of mRNAvaccines.Ideally,thedeliveryvehicleshouldprotectRN A against potential digestion by ribonuclease and confer eci ent targetcelluptake,easydissociationofRNAcargofromtheveh icle and escape from the endosome. Overcoming the barrier of the cytoplasmic membrane and avoiding digestion by RNases are the initial steps for ecient RNA delivery into target cells. T he nal important requirements for an optimal delivery vehicle are a lack of both toxicity and immune stimulation. In initia l studies, mRNA synthesized in vitrowas directly injected into animals.Subsequently,mRNAvaccinesformulatedinliposome s wereconrmedtoinduceavirus-specicanti-influenzacytot oxicT lymphocyte (CTL) immune response in mice ( 72). Several methods have been explored to increase delivery eciency and great progress has been made in the eld of designing delivery vehicles form RNA vaccines ( 101-103). In addition to the physical methods of gene guns and electroporation, mRNA vaccines have been delivered into the cytoplasm by cationic lipidsandpolymers.Cationicnano-emulsionformulatedmRNA was also shown to induce a potent immune response ( 8,23, 85). However, several of these delivery vehicles demonstrated toxicityin vivo, which may limit their use in humans ( 104). NewplatformsweredevelopedastransportationtoolsformRNA vaccines to avoid the limitation of toxic chemical transfec tion reagents. Most of these platforms utilized LNPs based on modied cationic lipid or lipid polymers. LNPs facilitate the delivery of RNA and enhances antigen expression dramatically. Several groups have utilized lipids or polymers as a platform to deliver mRNA vaccines against HIV-1 by a subcutaneous route,whichecientlyelicitedHIV-specicCD4andCD8Tcell responses, or by an intranasal route, which induced antige n- specic immune response ( 73,105,106). Lipid-encapsulated mRNA of influenza HA gene segments was tested and showedTcellactivationfollowingasingledose( 107).Combining LNP technology with LNP-formulated of influenza virus HA from H10N8 and H7N9 induced a potent protective immune response in mice, ferrets, and cynomolgus monkeys( 108). Another target against which LNP delivery of formulated mRNA has shown great potential is Zika virus. No vaccine is available to prevent this mosquito-borne disease and the rece nt epidemic has caused worldwide concern. Richner et al. reported that LNPs elicited robust immune responses and protected guinea pigs from Ebola virus disease as well ( 52). Intravenous (i.v.) injection with modied mRNA i.m. administration with non-replicating mRNA encoding influenza H10encapsulatedinLNPsinducedhighprotectivetiters,butth is response occurred more rapidly by i.d. administration than by i.m.administration( 95). LNPsareapopulardeliveryvehicleforself-amplifyingmRNA vaccines well. A plethora of studies have shown that self- amplifying mRNA encapsulated in LNP induced potent cellular by dierent administration routes (19,107,111). LNP formulated self-amplifying mRNA vaccines encoding influenza virus antigens resulted in poten t T and B cell immune responses and conferred protection against homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges as w ell (63,65,112). Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), a type of cationic peptide, represent promising tools for mRNA delivery into intracellular target sites. Protamine is an arginine-rich cationic peptide that can bind to mRNA and transport it into cytoplasm. Protamine was extensively used as a delivery system for cancer and vira l Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 6 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 594Zhang et al. mRNA Vaccine Against Infectious Diseases mRNAvaccines.Theself-adjuvantedRNActivevaccineplatform was created with protamine and has demonstrated potency against various infectious diseases and cancers ( 76,77,100). Recently, Coolen and colleagues designed innovative deliver y platform consisting of poly(lactic acid) and cationic-penetr ating nano-emulsi stimulated protection against homologous and heterologous influenza virus ( 65). Formulation in polyethylenimine (PEI) of self-amplifying mRNA encoding H1N1/PR8-HA resulted in a signicantly higher antibody titer and longer durable antigen expression than using non-formulated self-amplifyi ng mRNA (31,114). Chitosan and PEI were also utilized to deliver self-amplifying-mRNAasnanoparticles( 114,115).Chahaletal. developed an intriguing platform consisting of a chemically modied dendrimer nanoparticle to condense self-amplifying mRNA encoding influenza HA. A single immunization in mice elicited potent CD8 +T cell and antibody responses and protected mice against a broad spectrum of lethal pathogen challenges, including H1N1 influenza, Toxoplasma gondii, an d Ebolavirus( Additional currently being investigated,suchaspolyplexes,nanoplexesandporouspolymer delivery ( great advances havebeenachievedinthedevelopmentofdeliverytools,theid eal platformmaybeacombinationofdierentmRNAdeliverytools and more eorts in understanding mechanism of action might berequired. MECHANISM OF IMMUNE RESPONSE INDUCED BY mRNA VACCINES The immune response mechanism instigated by mRNA remains to be elucidated. The process of mRNA vaccine recognition by cellular sensors and the mechanism of sensor activation are still not clear. Intracellularly, two kinds of RNA sensors, endoso mal toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the RIG-I-like receptor family, have been identied. The former set is divided into TLR-3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, which are localized in the endosomal compartment of professional immune surveillance cells, such as DCs, macrophages and monocytes. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA longer than 45 base pair as well as dsRNA resulting from single strand RNA (ssRNA) forming secondary structures or derived from viral replication intermediates. TLR7 and TLR8 are activated by RNAs rich and/or TLR7 TLR8 recognizes ssRNA only ( 123). TLR7 activation can increase antigen presentation, promote cytok ine secretion and stimulate B cell responses ( 124). The latter family, functioning as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), includes RIG-I, MDA5, and stimulate IFN production ( 126-130). The panhandle structure in viral genomesegments was directly involved IFNinduction through RIG-I activation ( 131). MDA5 is another cytosolic RNA sensor that detects long dsRNA generated during RNA virus replication (132) as well as RNA of synthetic origin, including poly I:C. Recognition by dsRNA induces the activation of IRF3 and NF- B, subsequently leading to increased production of type I IFN (127,133,134). Sometimes, the elements of dsRNA recognized by PRR sensors can function as an adjuvant through the inductionofIFN( 135-137).mRNAvaccinescanstimulateinnate immunity through TLRs 3,7, 138, 139). IFN induction by mRNA vaccines through RNA sensors is dependent on the quality of in vitrotranscribed mRNA, delivery vehicle, and administration route. mRNA sensing by the innate immune system is a double-edged sword in the elimination of invadingmolecules.NaturalexogenousmRNAstimulatesstro ng induction of type I INFs and potent inflammatory cytokines, which instigate T and B immune responses but may negatively aectantigenexpression( 140-143).Interestingly,Blanchardand colleagues established a method to measure PRR activation by IVT mRNA in cells and in tissue section. In this method, proximityligationassays(PLAs)wasemployed( 144). i.d. vaccination with the RNactive vaccine technology from CureVac AG, induced strong immune responses that are dependentonTLR7signal.TLR7activationleadstoupregulation ofchemokines,whichinturnrecruitinnateimmunecellssuch as DCs and macrophages to the site of injection ( 100). Activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF- andIL-6 which are known to contribute to immune cells recruitment have been observedattheinjectionsite( 145). On the other hand, an early shut-down of antigen expression after the mRNA vaccination due to PRRs activation might be detrimental.Consistentlyantigenexpression,humoraland Tcell responses to mRNA vaccination, both from conventional and amplifyingmRNA,weresignicantlyenhancedinIFNAR1/2/ mice(105,146)orbyco-administrationofIFNantagonist( 147). The negative impact from excessive IFN activation could deriv e not only from preventing RNA amplication, in case of self- amplifying mRNA vaccines, and expression, but also at the level of T cells. While type I IFN can determine the dierentiation of antigen-primed CD8+T the HPLC can reduce immune activation and increase antigen stability and expression ( 35,148,149). For an instance, i.p injection with mRNA containing pseudouridines induced antigen expression without the induction of cytokines in mic e (150). Furthermore, some publications have shown that purity and delivery systems aect the immune response stimulated by mRNA vaccines ( 35). More interestingly, a recent study showed that modied mRNA encapsulated into LNPs has an adjuvant eectandinducesapotentTfollicularhelperresponseandalarge number of germinal center B cells with long-living, high ani ty neutralizingantibodies( 78). Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 594Zhang et al. mRNA Vaccine Against Infectious Diseases Dentritic cell(DC) maturation is crucial to the eectivenes s of mRNA-based vaccines. Generally, TLR7 was expresssed in plasmacytoid dentritic cells (pDCs) and B cells in humans, and TLR8 was expressed in conventional dentritic cells (cDCs) , monocytesandmacrophages.cDCsconstitutethemajorreside nt DC population in normal human dermis and are characterized byCD1cexpression(alsoknownasblooddendriticcellantige n- 1 (BDCA-1), whereas plasmacytoid DCs are present in the skin (129,151,152). The TLR7 and TLR8 locations in dierent DC subsets and DC locations in dierent organs may clarify the relationship between immune ecacy and the administration route and formulation of mRNA vaccines. Replacement of modied nucleotidesin mRNA decreased activation by binding mRNA to PRRs and reduced the innate immune response (153). mRNA vaccines not only stimulated the specic humoral immuneresponsebythetranslatedantigenbutalsotheantige n- specic T cell response. Administration route and vaccine formulation determine the peak of antigen expression, which i s another way to modulate the immune response ( 94,154,155). Liang et al. have shown that the kinetics of cell inltration was largely similar between i.m. and i.d. administration in NHP s (156).Thei.d.groupshowedstrongerinitialresponses,probably because of rapid targeting, activation and transport to dLNs o f skin DCs. Furthermore, only skin monocytes and DCs showed evidence of antigen translation at day 9, indicating prolonge d antigen availability after i.d. delivery, and conrming th e longer expressionofmRNA-encodedantigenobservedinmice( 94). A better elucidation of the sequence of events leading to mRNA translation and immune activation will help engineer mRNA vaccines to induce the correct balance of type I IFN induction,positivelyaectingvaccineoutcome. CLINICAL TRIALS Compared with the prophylactic and therapeutic application of mRNA in cancer, clinical trials of mRNA vaccines for infectiou s disease are still in their early age. Pilot clinical trials w ith DCs transfected with mRNA encoding various HIV-1 antigens, cellular molecules, or pp65 of human cytomegalovirus showed that mRNA vaccines are safe and that they elicited antigen- specicCD4+andCD8+Tcellimmune responses;however,no reductionofviralloadwasobserved( 157-160). In a recent clinical trial of protamine complexed mRNA vaccine against rabies virus, the results showed that RNA complexed with protamine is safe and well-tolerated in vivo, but ecacy was highly dependent on the dose and route of administration. The ecacy of administration with a needle- free device was much better than with direct needle injection (57,161). Results of a phase I showed LNP-formulated modied H10N8 mRNA vaccine induced robust humoral immune response in volunteers with mild or moderate adverse reaction( 108). PROSPECTIVE OF RNA-BASED VACCINES A plethora of publications have shown that mRNA-based vaccines are a promising novel platform that is high flexible,scalable, inexpensive, and cold-chain free. Most importantly , mRNA-based vaccines can ll the gap between emerging pandemic infectious disease and a bountiful supply of eective vaccines. A variety of preclinical and clinical projects have m ade enormous strides toward the conceivable application of mRNA vaccines and have suggested that mRNA-based prophylaxis and therapy can be translated to human applications. Although in medical application, magnitude of responses was lower than predicted from than those observed into animal models, the results of pilot clinical trials have shown good tolerabilit y and that mRNA vaccination can induce antigen-specic T and B cell immune responses ( 57,108). Therefore, mRNA holds great promises, but further insights into the mechanism of action and potency are still needed for full development of mRNA vaccines. The exploration of new strategies is needed to crea te applicablemRNAvaccinesandtodecreasethedose.Asdescribed above, the molecular impact of the innate immune response stimulated by mRNA through PAMP recognition is still not clear. Multiple eorts have been made to improve the stability and delivery eciency of in vivomRNA vaccine, including incorporation of 5and 3terminal untranslated regions and chemicallymodiednucleosides( 162-164).Studydemonstrated removal of dsRNA contaminants by high performance liquid chromatography purication of in vitro transcribed mRNA prolonged the translation ( 35). Research has demonstrated that modied nucleoside decreases the innate immune response and enhances protein expression. Optimization of the 5- untranslated region (5-UTR) of mRNA, whose secondary structures are recognized by cell-specic RNA binding proteins or PAMP molecules can maximize the translational yield of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines ( 43,165). However, improper incorporationofmodiednucleosidescanhaveanegativeimpac t ontranscriptionproductsandincreasecosts. Based on the results of the above described studies, a better understanding of the mechanism of action of mRNA vaccines, the identication and development of a new deliver y system, and improvement of mRNA vaccine design will be attained( 166). mRNA vaccines have great potential and oer advantages over conventional vaccines. The growing body of preclinical and clinical results demonstrates that prophylaxis and thera py with mRNA promises to be useful for preventing infectious disease and treating tumors and that mRNA vaccines are safe and tolerated in animal models and humans. Additionally, future improvements should increase antigen-specic immune responsesandthemagnitudeofmemoryimmunecellresponses, including memory B and T cell responses. Although mRNA vaccine technology has still not extensively tested in human s, publications of preclinical and early clinical tests have emer ged in recent years, in which promising results were reported. This evoked the momentum of biocompanies to commercialize mRNA vaccines with great enthusiasm ( 167,168). Some private fundingresourcesandinstituteshavesupportedtheresearch and development of mRNA vaccines ( 169,170). Despite the need for further optimization of manufacturing processes to gener ate mRNAvaccines,theseprocesseshopefullywillbestreamlinedt o be establish large-scale production. It is just a matter of tim e for RNAvaccinestobeusedinhumansandanimals.
