The side effect is that you may lose 7 to 10 pounds ... or even more. That's a pretty impressive benefit, and one that shows you how much influence what you eat and how you live have on your weight, your health, and your quality of life. In just one week you can make significant changes in your health and weight\u2014 changes that can set you on the path to the lifelong pursuit of UltraWellness. The UltraSimple Diet teaches you how you can do that by offering an easy-to-follow, comprehensive method for reducing inflammation and toxicity\u2014two key elements that are sending your body out of balance and inhibiting your ability to lose weight. By following the simple one-week program, you have the opportunity to utilize these keys to vital health and regain control of your weight and your life. The basic program is very simple. Y ou just eliminate the foods that are making you sick and fat, and you start eating foods that will make you healthy and thin. The enhanced program helps you integrate supplements and lifestyle changes the program that can make your experience even more powerful. That's all there is to it. As I was writing the book, there were so many things that I wanted to share with you: tools that would make the program even simpler, UltraSimple recipes that I love, alternative eating choices to fit any taste or lifestyle, articles that would deepen your understanding of the concepts in the book, background on what kinds of supplements to take, and much more. But there are page limits. Not everything fit into the book. I had to make some choices about what to put in. I couldn't share everything I know about inflammation and detoxification with you. Nor could I give you all the tools I have acquired in more than 20 years of treating patients for the same weight and health problems you are facing right now. So I broke it down. I decided that all the critical information you need to make the program work would go in the book. Everything else would go in this downloadable companion guide you can use to make the program even simpler!The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 2 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCIn this guide, you will find: Alltheworksheetsandchecklistsinthebook,soyoucaneasilykeepall your information in one place Shoppingliststhatyoucanprintoutandtakewithyoutothegrocerystore (This should make your shopping experience even easier.)

Y ou will find the same is true when you go on the UltraSimple program.It's very likely you will experience weight loss and improved health you can see and feel on a qualitative level. That is, you may very well see your stomach and thighs shrink, feel that your clothes are fitting looser, watch as your complexion improves, feel a burst of energy you haven't had in years, experience reduction in joint and muscle pain, sleep better, and have many other extraordinary results on the one-week program. However, the best way to make the power of the program truly come home to you so you can fully understand the impact inflammation and toxicity have on your health and the difference it makes when you eliminate them is to take measurements. As you know from the book, I have designed a set of vital measurements that will make it clear how much one week can change you. Thefirstisthe\"ToxicityandInflammationQuiz.\"Thisquizisdesignedtoshowyou how much toxicity and inflammation you are suffering with right now, and it will give you a sense of how much the program can help you.

YOUR SCORE HEALTH STATUS BENEFITS YOU MAY RECEIVE* 10 or less Optimal health Increased energy, improved mood, and weight loss 11-50 Mildimbalance In addition to the above, you may also see improved digestion, better skin, and less nasal congestion. 51-100 Moderateimbalance Y ou may experience all of the above as well as reduced joint pain, muscle aches, headaches, and more. Over 100 Severe imbalance Y ou may experience much of the above, but to deeply address your chronic symptoms you will need the support of a physician trained in FunctionalMedicine. *The benefits for each progressive level of health imbalance are additive. That means, the more imbalanced your health currently is, the more benefits you are likely to receive from the program. For example, if you currently have a moderate health imbalance (a score of 51-100), you will likely experience all the benefits listed for earlier categories (increased energy, improved mood, weight loss, improved digestion, better skin, and less nasal congestion) as well as the benefits listed in your category.

Y ou wouldn't take a trip to Europe without planning for it. By the same token, you are going to have to plan your journey so you succeed on the UltraSimple program and eventually attain UltraWellness.

Y ou know more than you think about how to care for your mind, body, and spirit. Journaling can help you contact this wealth of information you already possess. Studies have shown that journaling can have a profound effect on stress and inflammation as well as a powerful impact on your health. Every day new research is published confirming the connection between mental health and physical health. In fact, the mind-body connection is another important key to UltraWellness. Journaling is one way you can begin to understand this connection for yourself. In this section you will find all the journaling exercises in the book divided up by day, with spaces to fill in your responses. Y ou can print out these pages and keep them on your desk or by your bedside to make it that much simpler to do the journaling component of the program and access a rich, internal treasure you may not even know you have. DO NOT underestimate the power of this part of the program. Journaling can have a very profound influence on your life. In fact, one of the things I have heard from patients overandoveragainishowbeneficialthispartoftheprogramis.Manyaresurprisedathow much they learn about themselves through journaling. Don't pass up this opportunity to have that experience for yourself. It is an important part of this week of healing and re-centering your mind and body. Feel free to use extra plain pages, a journal, or a notebook if you need more space or have more to say.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 37 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCJournalingExercise BeforeYouStarttheProgram IrecommendyoudothisjournalingexerciseBEFOREyoustarttheprogram.

I developed it this way to keep preparation time down and make it fit the schedule of a typical working person. However, over the years I have found that some people like to have alternatives to this plan. Morethanthat,Iknowpeoplelove to have specific recipes they can follow to make delicious and healthy meals that may help them reduce inflammation, detoxify, lose weight, and get healthy. As long as you stick to a few basic principles (such as being rigorous about which foods you enjoy and which ones you avoid), The UltraSimple Diet affords enough flexibility to accommodate anyone's desires. And there are plenty of ways you can make real, whole foods taste absolutely delicious. In this section I am going to give you some alternative food choices to accommodate different lifestyles and desires (as well as recipes for the alternatives) and I am going to share some of my personal favorite UltraSimple recipes with you.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 56 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCMyFavoriteUltraSimpleRecipes What follows are some of my favorite UltraSimple recipes as well as alternative food choices you can incorporate into the program if you wish to. This food is delicious! Even the gourmets who are reading this are going to find some of these recipes a revelation. There seems to be a myth that eating well means the food should taste bad. How ridiculous! These recipes are healthy, they fit into your detox week, and they are going to satisfy your palate as well as your body. Recipes for Alternative Breakfast Options The UltraShake is easy to prepare and delicious and contains powerful nutrients that may help you reduce inflammation and detoxify your body. However, some people prefer to have a hot breakfast in the morning, especially if they are doing the program in the winter in an area that is extremely cold. In these circumstances it can be a little daunting to face drinking a cold shake before going off to work. The first thing you can try is adding 1 cup of UltraBroth to your breakfast menu. This might do the trick and will keep you from preparing too many additional items. If the UltraBroth in the morning does not do the trick, there are at least 3 hot breakfast alternatives you could try. Below you will find recipes for each of themThe Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 57 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCHotRiceCerealwithAlmonds,Walnuts, Pecans,FlaxSeeds,and/orFruit Makes:4servings(~2/3cupserving) INGREDIENTS MEASUREMENTS Brown dry .......................................... 1 cup Unsweetened soy milk* ........................................ 3 cups Ground cinnamon ............................................. 1 tsp.

This trend is starting to change but the process is slow, and that is a problem. New research links environmental toxins (external toxins) and internal toxins to disruptions in key mechanisms that promote weight loss and health. If you have been struggling for years to lose weight but have been thwarted in your attempts, excess toxicity may be the cause. I refer to toxins in the broadest sense\u2014the sum total of our poor diet, chronic stress, and environmental pollutants that overload and poison our bodies and minds. Little wonderthenthattoxicitystandsinthewayofweightlossforsomany.Virtuallyeveryoneon the planet is carrying around a toxic load that is damaging his or her health. The way around this is to amplify your body's natural and critical ability to detoxify. As you know, that is one of the keys that makes The UltraSimple Diet so effective. The program is designed to help you begin the process of detoxification.

These include phytonutrient-rich foods such as brassicas (broccoli, collards, kale, bok choy, cabbage, and Chinese cabbage), garlic and onions, lemon peel, green tea, watercress, cocoa, pomegranate, cilantro, and artichoke.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 105 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llC Use detoxifying herbs, including milk thistle, green tea, and dandelion. Additional supplements that can be helpful include N-acetyl cysteine, alpha-lipoic acid, amino acids, and bioflavonoids. Takeprobioticsforhealthybacteriainyourgut. Eat high-quality fats to flush your liver, such as omega-3 fatty acids and adequate monounsaturated oils from olive oil, avocados, and almonds. Drink enough fluid to help your kidneys flush out toxins. Increase your overall intake of plant foods to alkalinize the body and the urine, which helps boost toxin excretion. PracticalSuggestionsforDetoxification The following suggestions are practical ways you can enhance the detoxification processyoustartedonTheUltraSimpleDiet.Remembersomeofthesestepsarealreadyon the program, others are not. In some cases, you will find recommendations for eating foods that are specifically forbidden on the program (such as eggs). Y ou can use these foodstohelpyoucontinuedetoxifyingafteryouhavecompletedtheprogramandstartedreintegrating foods. Incorporate the following steps into your daily health regimen. Remove Toxins Eat organic food, including organic animal products to avoid petrochemical pesticides, herbicides, hormones, and antibiotics. Drink filtered water (use a reverse osmosis or carbon filter). HEPA / ULPA filters and ionizers can be helpful in reducing dust, molds, volatile organic compounds, and other sources of indoor air pollution. Clean and monitor heating systems for release of carbon monoxide, the most common cause of death by poisoning in America. Have houseplants that help filter the air. Air out your dry cleaning before wearing it. Avoid excess exposure to environmental petrochemicals (such as garden chemicals, dry cleaning solvents, car exhaust, and second-hand smoke). Reduceoreliminatetheuseoftoxichouseholdandpersonalcareproducts(such as aluminum-containing underarm deodorant, antacids, and pots and pans).The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 106 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llC Removeallergensanddustfromyourhomeasmuchaspossible.

Reduceheavymetalexposure(inpredatoryandriverfish,water,leadpaint, thimerosal-containing products, etc.). Improve Elimination of Toxins Have 1 to 2 bowel movements a day. Drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day. Sweat regularly. Use exercise to help you sweat regularly. Use steam baths or saunas\u2014infrared saunas may be even more beneficial. Regularexercise,yoga,andlymphaticmassagecanimprovelymphflowand help flush toxins out of your tissues into your circulation so they can be detoxified. Increase Fiber Intake Eat more beans, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds. If necessary, add such supplements as flax, psyllium, or konjac root to increase your fiber intake, as outlined in my book UltraMetabolism. Feed Your Gut with Healthy Bacteria Takingprobioticssuchaslactobacillusandbifidobacterspecieshelpsnormalize gut flora and reduce endotoxins (toxins produced by imbalances in gut bacteria). Foods and Phytochemicals That Boost Detoxification Trytoeatatleastonecupofcruciferousvegetablesdaily.Thisincludesbroccoli, kale, collards, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. Eat a few cloves of garlic every day or take a garlic supplement. Trydecaffeinatedgreenteainthemorning. Tryfreshvegetablejuices,includingcarrots,celery,cilantro,beets,parsley,and ginger.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide bark, and other herbs. Eat high-quality sulfur-containing proteins, such as eggs, whey protein, garlic, and onions. Consume citrus peels, caraway, and dill oil (they contain limonene). Consume bioflavonoids in grapes, berries, and citrus fruits. Consume dandelion greens to help liver detoxification, improve the flow of bile, and increase urine flow. Eat celery to increase the flow of urine and aid in detoxification. Consume cilantro, which may help remove heavy metals. Consume rosemary, which contains carnosol, a potent booster of detoxification enzymes. Consume curcuminoids (turmeric and curry) for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action. Consume burdock root for aid in detoxification. Consume chlorophyll in dark-green leafy vegetables and in wheat grass. Takepycnogenol(foundingrapeseeds)insupplementformforsupportofdetoxification and circulation. Supplements for Detoxification The Basics Takeahigh-potencymultivitaminandmineralformula. Take1,000to4,000mgadayofextra-bufferedvitaminCwithmineralascorbates in powder, capsule, or tablets during periods of increased detoxification. (This can cause loose stools. If it does, just reduce the dose or stop.) Take70to210mgadayofmilkthistle(silymarin). Supplement this program with 1,000 to 2,000 mg a day of essential fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acids).The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 108 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCAdditional Supplements (Use Under Medical Supervision) N-acetylcysteine (500 to 1,000 mg a day) Amino acids (500 mg of taurine twice a day, 500 mg of glycine twice a day) Alpha-lipoic acid (100 mg to 600 mg a day) Carnitine (1,000 to 2,000 mg a day in divided doses) Bioflavonoids (in citrus, pine bark, grape seed, and green tea) Testingfor ToxinsandDetoxificationFunction I use testing extensively in my practice to pinpoint which systems in the body are out of balance. However, the testing I do goes well beyond the tests offered in a typical doctor's office. I do a comprehensive set of tests that help me identify underlying genetic and lifestyle causes that are creating chaos in my patients' bodies. This helps me personalize a health program that will help them leverage the natural power the body has to heal itself, lose weight, and achieve lifelong health and vitality. The following are some of the tests available for determining how toxic you are and howwellyourdetoxificationsystemisworking.Someofthemareavailableonline.Mostcan be administered by practitioners of functional medicine. Unfortunately, not many of them will be available in a typical general practitioner's office, unless the doctor has a background in systems medicine or other holistic forms of treatment. If you are interested in taking your detoxification process to the next level, taking these tests can help. Locate a practitioner of functional medicine who will give them to you, or find the tests online. They can be a great benefit to your overall understanding of how your detoxification system is working. If you need help finding a practitioner of functional medicine go to www.ultrawellness.com/findadoctor for more information. For more information about how to find these tests (and others) online go to www.ultrawellness.com/tests .

The bad news is that we're being poisoned. The good news is that we can dramatically reduce the impact of toxins by being aware of where they come from and changing our habits. Then we can use modern science to help boost our bodies' natural detoxification system. For more information on how to detoxify see my books UltraMetabolism and The Detox Box. Also, in Appendix A of this guide, there is an important article I have written on the subject.110 supplements is critical for maintaining optimal health. /T_his is true for one important reason: /T_he foods we eat are depleted of the fundamental chemicals our bodies need to function optimally. /T_here are not as many vitamins and minerals in the foods you eat today as there were in these same foods generations ago. For that reason and based on decades of research on the importance of vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fats for health, I advise everyone to get on an essential supplement program to help promote optimal health on an ongoing basis. I recommend you get on these essential supplements whether you are on /T_he UltraSimple Diet or not, and I recommend you stay on them a/f_ter the program is /f_inished. You do not have to use these supplements to make the program work, but I strongly recommend them both while you are on the program and on an ongoing basis every day for the rest of your life. In addition to the essential supplement package, there are a variety of other supplements you can take to help support and enhance certain systems in your body during prep week and while you are on the enhanced program. During prep week I suggest taking supplements that will help support detoxi/f_ication and minimize withdrawal symptoms. For the enhanced program I focus on detoxifying supplements and anti-in/f_lammatory agents that may help you acquire even further bene/f_its from /T_he UltraSimple Diet. /T_here are, of course, many other supplements you can take for many dierent health eects. Many of these are outlined in my books UltraMetabolism , and /T_he UltraMind Solution . However, in this guide I am going to focus on what I discussed in /T_he UltraSimple Diet\u2014the essential supplement plan I recommend, the supplements for the enhanced program, and the supplements you need for prep week. In the charts that follow I provide a detailed assessment of exactly what I recommend you take while you are on the program. Note that the supplements outlined are the SAME supplements I give my patients. /T_hey are pharmaceutical grade products created by companies that have risen to the challenge of creating extremely high-quality supplements. /T_hey may be slightly more expensive than products you will /f_ind in an average health food store, but in this case you get what you pay for\u2014clean supplements that are free of preservatives, /f_illers, binders, excipients, /f_low agents, shellacs, coloring agents, allergens, and other products that lower-quality manufacturers sometimes use in their products.111 COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2007 ULTRAWELLNESS, LLCT U S D C G All of the charts below are organized as follows: Type\u2014In the \"Type\" column on the le/f_t, you will /f_ind the type of supplement I recommend you take (multivitamin/mineral, calcium/magnesium, etc.) Brand\u2014In the \"Brand Name\" column, you will /f_ind the speci/f_ic brand of supplement I suggest.

If you want to take the UltraSimple Diet Essentials Kit instead of your regular multivitamin and mineral, magnesium/calcium, vitamin D, /f_ish oil, and probiotic you can, but don't take your old supplements and these new supplements together. While there is little chance of \"overdosing\" on vitamins and minerals, it can be unsafe to take certain chemicals in extremely high doses. What is outlined in each of the kits above is safe to take. However, I typically do not recommend taking more than is suggested in the kits without a doctor's supervision. Do not replicate the doses above by taking your old vitamins and the supplements in these kits at the same time. It may be dangerous and is ill advised 2. Timing is important. You should take most (though not all) of your vitamins with food\u2014optimally with the meal or just before (unless otherwise indicated). People who take them a/f_ter a meal may /f_ind that the vitamins just sit on top of their food and upset their stomachs. Follow the guidelines above, or use the Daily Supplements Checklist below to guide you. If you still have an upset stomach when taking your supplements, /f_ind a doctor who can help to correct any digestive problems, which are o/f_ten the source of intolerance. 3. Take /f_ish oil just before meals to prevent any /f_ish taste from coming up. Or keep the bottle of /f_ish oil capsules in the freezer so that the capsule will have time to reach your intestine before it dissolves. As long as you follow the guidelines in the charts above, taking your supplements should be UltraSimple, but to make the process even smoother I have developed the following Daily Supplement Checklist.T U S D C G117 COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2007 ULTRAWELLNESS, LLCD/a.sc/i.sc/l.sc/y.sc S/u.sc/p.sc/p.sc/l.sc/e.sc/m.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc C/h.sc/e.sc/c.sc/k.sc/l.sc/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc I recommend quite a few supplements. Even my essential daily recommendations for supplements are a little overwhelming for some people when they /f_irst start taking them. If you aren't used to taking supplements it's easy to forget about them at /f_irst. Don't worry. With time it will become second nature. /T_his is further complicated if you are doing the enhanced version of the program. For one thing there are more supplements to take; for another, the time at which you take each of these supplements is critical to some degree. You should take the detoxi/f_ication supplements at certain times of the day to maximize their eect. /T_hat is why I was so speci/f_ic about what time to take the enhanced supplements in the book. To help you organize yourself and remember to take your supplements as you are getting started, I have created the following Daily Supplement Checklist. On it you will /f_ind the essential supplement package I recommend in bold type and the supplements for the enhanced program in plain type. If you are on the enhanced program AND you want to add the essential supplement package, you should take everything on the list as noted; however, if you are the enhanced program and do NOT want to add the essential supplement package, then simply following the instructions for everything that's in regular font and NOT in bold. I recommend you print out seven copies of this checklist, /f_ill in the appropriate day for each, and then post it next to your daily checklist as a further reminder to take your supplements. Check items o on this list as you go, just as you do with your daily checklists. At some point you will not need this checklist anymore. Taking your supplements will become second nature. Until that happens, use the checklist to help you create good health habits for yourself. Remember, timing is important. So make sure you pay special attention to the times I have assigned for each supplement. If you forget one, take it sometime during the day. If you accidentally skip a day, get back on track the following day.T U S D C GDinner (Take /T_hese Before Eating) Bedtime or Evening RitualLunch (Take /T_hese With Your Meal)10 am (Herbal Laxative\u2014If Necessary) 118 COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2007 ULTRAWELLNESS, LLCDaily Supplements Checklist Supplements for Day of: ______________________________________T U S D C G Upon Waking Breakfast (Take /T_hese Before Eating)1 tsp. buered ascorbic acid vitamin C powder in 8 ounces of water or 2-3 tablets / capsules of buered ascorbic acid vitamin C (approximately 2,000-3,000 mg) Multivitamin / mineral (See speci/f_ications above for total dosages.

This will help you identify food sensitivities and allergies you have, putting you back in control of the food you put in your body. Iurg o f all, it's dangerous. If you do this, you might feel 10 times worse than you did before you started the program. Why? When you eliminate foods you are allergic to, you remove foreign molecules (antigens) that antibodies in your blood stream grab onto causing allergic reactions. However, you cannot eliminate the antibodies themselves so quickly. As a result, when you eat foods you are sensitive to, these antibodies attack them in full force, causing even worse reactions than the ones you had before you went on the program. Second, you will never fully regain control of your weight, your health, and your life until yo uident ifywhic eal lergicto , you c an make a choice about how to handle these foods. Y ou may eat them as you always have. Y ou may eat them in moderation. Or you may decide not to eat them anymore at all. But you won't be able to make this choice until you have identified your problem foods. Again, this is an area of the program many patients are excited about. Living the UltraWellness lifestyle isn't only about losing weight. It's about learning how the foods you eat affect your health and leveraging this knowledge to improve your life. I know people want to have this information, because I hear about it from my patients every day. Make sur eyo utrac kyo urre actions tofo wha t to do about it can be found in the book.

The tips below are divided by category: food, detoxification, inflammation, sleep, supplements, exercise, and stress. Feel free to incorporate any or all of these tips as you progress through the program or any other time in your life to enhance your health and improve your quality of life. FoodTips The Importance of Fruits and Vegetables Practically the only thing everyone agrees about in nutrition is that eating five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day can reduce your risk of diseases. How is it we have come to depend on the magical chemicals in these plants for ideal health? Oneth eoryiscoe volution, or\"sy mbiotic ph ytoadaptation.\" We evolved eating certain foods and learned to use those compounds to keep our biochemistry and physiology operating in top form. These compounds protect plants. We have adapted and use the powerful substances in our food to promote health and stop disease. If there's one thing I can't emphasize enough, it's how important it is that you eat vegetables (lots of them!) every day for the rest of your life. Try Some Legumes Have you tried any legumes yet, or have you only been eating chicken and fish? If you haven't tried any legumes yet, I strongly recommend you do so. Legumes contain all sorts of healing chemicals including saponins and protease inhibitors. They are also full of fiber, which helps promote healthy gut ecology. Not only that, but they're easy to prepare. See the recipes in this guide or recommendations in the book for simple and delicious ways to prepare them.

Y ou won't regret it!The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 123 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCThe Truth About Fat It is hard to imagine that a population that consumes so much fat could be fat deficient, but that's the way it is. It's because we eat the wrong kinds of fat. Ironically, the fact that we eat so little good fat is part of what keeps us fat. For most of us, 20-30% of our diet should be fat. But it has to be good fat to be healthy. What you need to do is understand fat\u2014the good, the bad, and the ugly. Here's the breakdown\u2014many foods contain a mixture of these different fats. I have identified which are good, which are bad, and which are downright ugly and offered examples of the main sources for each. The Good Omega-3 fats (ALA, EPA, DHA)\u2014from flax seeds, seafood, wild game Essential, omega-6 fats such as gamma linolenic acid (GLA) from borage or primrose oil Omega-9 fats or monounsaturated oils\u2014mostly olive oil, nuts, and avocados The Bad Nonessential omega-6 fats\u2014polyunsaturated from most vegetable oils Saturated fats\u2014from animal Eat most of your fat from extra-virgin olive oil, fish, flax, nuts, avocados, and seeds, with minimal amounts of properly processed (expeller-pressed) vegetable oils, and include only small amounts of saturated fat from animal foods.

Avoid oils that do not state the method of extraction or have a bitter aftertaste orran cidfla vor. The Power of Fiber Fiber scrubs the intestinal tract clean, provides food for the healthy bacteria in your gut, and regulates proper hormone balance. Unfortunately, the average American has only about 8 grams of fiber a day. Our Paleolithic ancestors had about 100 grams he flax seeds. Grind \u00bd cup at a time and keep them in a tightly sealed glass jar in the fridge or freezer. Sprinkle on salads or grain or vegetable dishes, or mix into a little unsweetened applesauce. Eat beans (all forms of legumes)\u2014they beat out everything else for fiber.

Clean Your Water Some of the hazards of unpurified water include chlorine, fluoride, metals, petrochemicals, and microorganisms. Other petrochemical and industrial contaminants can leach into deep aquifers (large underground rivers and lakes that supply much of our water) leading to cancer and hormonal havoc. In fact, a recent EPA report confirmed that most of our nation's aquifers are contaminated. I recommend you purify your water by filtering it\u2014reverse osmosis is best; other options include carbon filters.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 128 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCHere are some tips on ways to clean your water: Have a reverse osmosis filter installed in your house for drinking or for the whole system. If you don't have filtration for your whole house, a carbon filter attached to your shower and bath will reduce chlorine exposure. Use portable water filters when traveling. These are usually in plastic bottles or look like pitchers (Brita filter, for example). Use alysis from the company. Use mineral or still water from glass bottles. Avoid drinking any bottled water stored in a plastic container. The plastics leach into the water, especially when stored in hot conditions. Ask your local public health department for a reference lab in your area that assesses water quality. Have your well or municipal water analyzed, and ask for reports on all petrochemicals, heavy metals, and microorganisms. Detox with Massage Massage andavarietyofotherbodywork therapies including Swedish help you detoxify. Working directly on the body with these techniques increases blood and lymph flow, increases oxygen supply to your cells, increases the availability of nutrients to your cells, acts as a mechanical cleanser moving wastes into your circulation, promotes the elimination of toxic waste, relieves congestion and fluid buildup in the tissues, eliminates waste products from muscles, and balances the nervous system. All these effects can boost your ability to detoxify. So get a massage and help yourself detox. Inflammation Tips The Major Causes of Inflammation In addition to food allergies, there are other behaviors, aspects of our diet, and things we are exposed to in our environment that cause our bodies to become inflamed. Improvements in any of these areas are a major benefit and will help you further reduce the hidden fire that is smoldering in your body.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 129 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llC Malnutrition o Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, vitamin C, folate, and many other vitamins and minerals at less than optimal levels Internal toxins o Gut-derived toxins (ammonia, as putrescine) o Normal metabolic waste products External toxins o Synthetic compounds (air pollutants, water pollutants, food additives, and pesticides) o Prescription drugs, drugs of abuse, cosmetics, and household chemicals) o Naturally occurring compounds (microbial toxins, mycotoxins\u2014from mushrooms or aflatoxin from peanuts) o Heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, etc.) Infections o Chronic or acute oral infections including periodontal disease; infected root canals; and gut infections with parasites, bacteria, or yeasts Allergens o Environmental allergens (dust, animal dander, pollens, etc.) o food grains\u2014wheat, barley, oats, rye, spelt, kamut Dairy products\u2014milk, cheese, yogurt, butter Corn Ye a s t Eggs Peanuts Citrus Other foods in certain individuals Oxidative stress or free radicals Insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome (imbalance in blood sugar)The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 130 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llC Psychological stress Physical injuries or trauma Lack of blood flow (tense muscles or heart attacks) Laugh, Relax, and Meditate Manytechniques canbeusedtoreduceinflammation andbalance andstrengthen your imm une system.

In fact, inflammation reduction may be one of the major mechanisms by which exercise prevents illness and prolongs life. This may explain why long-term, regular exercise dramatically reduces heart disease, a condition we now know to be a disease of inflammation. From heart disease to dementia to arthritis to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue and even the aging process itself, nothing is more powerful than regular exercise for fighting The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 131 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCthe inflammation that is at the root of disease. Natural Anti-Inflammatories What follows is a list of COX-2 inhibitors (the same class pineapple stem) Capsaicin (from cayenne pepper) Carnosol and carnosic acid (in oregano) (found in tumeric) Gingerol, shogaol (a very powerful anti-inflammatory in ginger) Green tea catechins (See the tip on supplements below for more information about how powerful green tea is.) Trans-Resveratrol (fo The Importance of Rest It is estimated that 70% of Americans are sleep deprived. Americans sleep 90 minutes less per night than they did 100 years ago. The era of Starbucks has been surpassed by one of prescription stimulants to keep people awake and functioning such as Y et we evolved along with the rhythms of day and night. They are used by us to signal a whole cascade of hormonal and neurochemical reactions that keep us healthy by repairing our DNA, building tissues and muscle, and regulating weight and mood chemicals. So if you're one of the people out there who sleeps only 5 hours a night and then drinks lattes and takes medications to stay awake, you need to seriously reconsider this policy if you want to lose weight and live a healthy life.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 132 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCUse Your Bed Only for Sleep and Sex MuchlikePavlov's dogs,yoursleeprhythm canbeconditioned byexternal cues,and keep ing your bed for sleeping and sex goes a long way to setting up the right signals. No reading or television in bed. Using your bed for eating, working, watching television, or sending e-mails from your wireless laptop creates a conditioned response of wakefulness. If you wake up, get out of bed and go back only if you are ready to sleep. Do not try to force yourself to sleep. The more you try to fall asleep, the more you will stimulate your brain, making it that much harder to go to sleep. Create Total Darkness If you've had trouble sleeping, one problem might be the level of light in your room. Lack of complete darkness at night has a profound effect on the pineal gland in the brain, the control center for melatonin that regulates sleep and wakefulness. ero om you s leep in as dark as you can before you hop into bed, or use eye shades. Sit in the Sun The sun does more than keep us warm and nourish our souls. Its light enters our eyes and triggers our brain to release specific chemicals and hormones such as melatonin that are vital to healthy sleep, mood, and aging. The bright sun tells our brain to shut off melatonin during the day. Without it, our brains malfunction, leading to eating disturbances, changes in appetite, sleep, and mood; aging; and even the promotion and growth of cancer cells. I know it sounds ironic, but I recommend you get regular exposure to daylight for at least 20 minutes every day if you want to sleep well. Y ou will also receive the added benefit of your body making vitamin D, which may help control inflammation and improve metabolism. Don't Eat Right Before Bed Eating a heavy meal right before bed will lead to a bad night's sleep. If you can sleep at all, you will be more likely to get reflux, have nightmares, and feel sluggish in the morning. What's more, eating in the few hours before bed is a sure way to gain weight. For a detailed discussion on why this is true, see my book UltraMetabolism. I recommend you eat no later than three hours before bed to avoid this problem. Also avoid drinking a lot of fluids before bed\u2014have your 8 glasses of water before six o' clock at night. This will keep you from waking up frequently to urinate, which can The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 133 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCdisturb your sleep. Avoid Medications That Interfere with Sleep Certain medications (even those designed to help you sleep) can have a negative impact on your body's natural rhythms. Unless otherwise instructed by a doctor, I recommend you avoid these medications that can interfere with sleep: Sedatives (These are used to treat insomnia but ultimately lead to dependence and disruption of normal sleep rhythms and architecture.) Antihistamines Stimulants (oft enfo undincoldme dications an dweig ht-lossme dication) Cold medications Steroids Headache medications containing caffeine Supplement Tips Vitamin C Vitamin Cisoneofthebody'smainprotectors, anti-inflammatories, anddetoxifying nut rients.

So here are my suggestions for taking vitamin C: Y ou can take between 2,000 and 6,000 mg a day while detoxifying and about 1,000 to 2,000 mg a day for maintenance. Divide the dosage throughout the day to achieve maximum benefit. Build up slowly and taper off slowly when you are on a high dose for detoxification.

Mostmineralsarebesttakenasateamwithothermineralsinamulti-mineral formula which is why I always recommend a multivitamin and mineral supplement. People with kidney disease or severe heart disease should take extra magnesium only under a doctor's supervision The magnesium supplements I recommend for the enhanced plan are meant to help you with detoxification. However, for long-term health you should consider taking a magnesium supplement permanently. See Section 7 in this guide for more details. Probiotics Probiotics are the healthy bacteria that inhabit our digestive tract, produce vitamins, support immunity, metabolize toxins, produce food for our intestinal lining, and more. They are an important supplement for continued health, and unfortunately we don't get enough in our modern diet. If you aren't already taking probiotics, I strongly recommend that you start. Follow these guidelines when selecting and taking probiotics:The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 135 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llC Start a 6-to-12-week course of a probiotic to give your gut a chance to restore normal symbiosis or ecological balance.

See the recommendations on supplements for reputable brands. Unfortunately, yogurt will not provide adequate numbers of bacteria to do the job. So don't use it as a substitute. Bioflavonoids These are the key compounds or pigments (about 4,000 in total) that provide include citrus foods, ginkgo biloba, bilberry, genistein from soy, red wine (resveratrol), and green tea (catechins and epichatechins). What's important about them? They can all be used as part of your diet or in supplements to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. Here are three of the more important ones: Quercetin. This is the king of bioflavonoids. In part it acts by preventing the release of histamine, and it can help with food and environmental allergies. For food allergies take 500 mg about 15 minutes before meals to reduce food reactions. Resveratrol. This contains potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, potent ebo extrac t. Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) This everyday beverage in China contains a class of compounds called polyphenols, a type of flavonoids including catechins, epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, proanthocyanidins, and more.

It is up to you to find things you like and experiment with different types of exercise.

So do what you like\u2014regularly\u2014and watch the benefits of exercise affect your energy, your state of mind, your health, and your waistline! Improving Cardio I recommend you begin a regular regimen of cardiovascular exercise. Here are some tips on how to get different forms of exercise: walking, swimming, aerobics, jogging, in-line skating, jumping rope, rowing, cycling, spinning, exercise machines, cross-country skiing, skating, kickboxing, dancing, rebounding on a mini trampoline, hiking a mountain, or anything else that grabs you. Try toexer ciseinth efr eshairifpos sible. Be sure to increase your level of exertion as your fitness level improves. If you stay at that same speed and incline on the treadmill for years without increasing your effort, your benefits will go downhill.

Check Your Heart Rate Effective aerobic exercise is connected to how long and how consistently you h eart rate, and make sure you follow some simple guidelines about where it should be. Here's what a w eek The rough guide to your target heart rate is basically a simple equation: 220 minus your age times 0.70 to 0.85. This is designed to be about 70% to 85% of your maximum heart rate. This will vary from person to person but using this equation you can get a rough idea of where you are.

Here are some ideas that should help you: Obviously you can try weight training. If you do, make sure you: Start slowly with proper supervision. It is easy to hurt yourself. Sometimes your muscles are not strong enough to protect your joints, ligaments, and tendons from injury\u2014you will need to build up slowly. Be sure to use proper form. This is where guidance in the beginning can be critical. Not only will you miss the benefit of weight training if you do it improperly, but you can harm yourself. Build up to 2 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions for each of the four major muscle groups (chest and shoulders, upper back, upper legs, and abdominals). Do this three times a week. It should take you about 20 minutes for each session, or about an hour a week. Try (stretch bands you can take with you anywhere), power yoga, or Pilates. Commit to finding a good gym in your area to get introduced to these powerful techniques. Even six weeks of regular training can bring remarkable benefits.

Food Include the following whole foods in your daily diet: Good carbs (vegetables, fruit, beans, and whole grains) Good proteins (fish, soy, nuts and seeds, eggs, and lean animal protein such as chicken or turkey) Good fats (fish, nuts, seeds, extra-virgin olive oil, unrefined nut oils, and avocados) Avoid foods treated with petrochemical pesticides, herbicides, fumigants, hormones, or antibiotics. Whenever possible, buy certified organic fruits and vegetables and dairy products and eat organic or naturally raised animal products. If you can't find completely organic animal products, be sure to find those raised without antibiotics and hormones.

Choose Organic, Hormone- and Antibiotic-Free Food Buy hormone- and antibiotic-free animal products, such as dairy products, poultry, and red meat, whenever possible. Avoid eating fish that contain high levels of mercury, such as swordfish, tilefish, shark, king mackerel, and fresh tuna (canned tuna, especially chunk light, is lower in mercury). I recommend that you eat seafood with the least The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 142 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCmercury, including blue crab (mid-Atlantic), flounder, sole, salmon (wild), sardines, herring, anchovies, and shrimp. Check periodic updates on seafood safety on www.ewg.org and www.oceansalive.org. Buy a variety of seasonally fresh; locally grown; and, whenever possible, certified organic produce. Though organic food is generally more expensive, the benefits are worth it. Organic food does not contain the high levels of pesticides, hormones, and antibioticsfoundinconventionalfoods.Researchindicatesthatorganicfoodsalsohavemore nutrients than foods grown conventionally.

If you can't completely stick to organically grown produce (either because your grocery store doesn't carry it or because the cost is prohibitive), the following 12 items are generally considered the products that are least contaminated by pesticides. While I encourage you to buy as much organic produce as you can, if you can't these are items that would probably be safe to purchase in a conventionally grown form.

Use a vegetable brush on potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, or other hard produce whose skin you plan to eat. DrinkingCleanWater Makesuretodrinkcleanwater. If at all possible, have a reverse osmosis filter installed in your house, at least for your drinking water if not for the entire household system. Use bottled water certified as pure and in glass containers Avoid drinking any bottled water stored in a cloudy plastic container. Plastics such as phthalates leach into the water, especially when stored in hot conditions. It's best to drink water only from glass containers. If you have to drink from plastic containers, be sure they are hard clear plastic and you keep it to a minimum. Ask your local public health department for a reference lab in your area that assesses water quality.

It is called functional medicine and is not a fad. It is based on understanding all the systems of the body and the under lyingca t are inflammation and toxicity, and The UltraSimple Diet gives you an experience of that firsthand. UltraMetabolism explains the underlying principles of this new medical paradigm in greater detail. Another thing that makes this different is that I am a practicing physician, and I've been doing this for more than 20 years. I've treated thousands of patients. I've taken information from the scientific literature and combined it with my experience as a practicing ph the founder and medical director of The UltraWellness Center. I have distilled what I have learned into the first and only comprehensible comprehensive approach to dealing with the underling causes of obesity and impaired metabolism. The UltraSimple Diet is a quick start into a new way of life. That way of life is called UltraMetabolism, an dUl traMetabolism isno tadiet.It 'sawayofunder standing ho wyo ur bod y works and using that information to create a lifestyle program that is specific to you and works over the long run. It's not a quick fix. It will help you lose weight quickly, but it's not about a quick-fix program. It's about understanding the underlying causes of obesity and disease and fixing those problems. Problems with the wrong information getting to our genes, problems with inflammation, problems with mitochondria, problems with detoxification, problems with hormonal imbalance: These things are at the root of disease. A new revolution in health care is coming around the bend, and I'm trying to help people get access to it without waiting another 5 to 20 years for it to show up in your doctor's office.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 146 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCHow do I incorporate this program into my busy schedule? From someone who is extraordinarily busy, I can tell you there is a way. Y our life depends on it. But it takes planning. Mostofusdon uha ve to thin k about. If you don't think about it, you'll find yourself in a situation where you're stuck\u2014you're in an airport, you're in a car on the highway somewhere, you're in the mall where you don't have any food and you are hungry\u2014so like most hunters and gatherers, you will go hunt for something to eat and it's usually going to be something terrible. I encourage you to plan. It may mean having an emergency pack in your car. For example, I always have whole-food snack bars and a bag of nuts in my drawer at work. It may mean making time on the weekend to shop for the food you need for the week. It may mean planning your meals. I pack lunch, quickly, the night before; me much time, but it makes a huge difference over the course of my day by balancing my energy and metabolism. I think all of us need to examine our lives. What do you want? Do you want to feel good and have more energy? Or do you want to deal with chronic symptoms persistently interfering with your quality of life? Just like you can't expect to ignore your bank account and have your bankbook balance at the end of the month, your body needs attention, care, and strategic investment of time and planning. How do I stay on the plan when I travel and eat out a lot? I travel a lot, but I found a way to avoid food emergencies by always carrying food with me. When I travel on a plane, I have a bag of almonds, protein bars, or some fruit with me. In a restaurant, I can usually find something on the menu\u2014salad, fish or chicken, and an extra side of vegetables. I migh t hings are fairly simple to do and just take a little extra planning and foods on a restaurant menu. Pick the things that work for your body rather than the things that make you feel horrible at the end of the day. Just think about how you want to feel. Do you want to feel well, or do you want to feel badly? The choice is yours.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 147 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCHow can I overcome my food cravings, and will they ever go away completely? The answer is 'yes, ' and it doesn't take that long. It may take a couple of days just as it does when you're withdrawing from alcohol, nicotine, or caffeine. Wear or tr igger foods out of your diet, you will not crave them anymore. It may take a little detective work\u2014eliminating certain foods, then adding back the potentially allergenic foods\u2014or some testing, but addressing food allergies is a powerful way to stop cravings. Another major addiction / craving trigger is sugar and refined carbohydrates. Sugar addiction is a major epidemic. I'm subject to it like everybody else, and I know when I get out of balance. When I don't sleep enough, when I'm tired, I'll go for that sugar to give me a quick boost. Then I get into a vicious cycle. Once you stop, you won't crave it any longer. Y ou'll important to understand that sugar and food addiction is not necessarily balances, stress, and food allergies. Through addressing these factors systematically and directly through the things I outline in The UltraSimple Diet and UltraMetabolism the addiction will go away. In fact, it can go away in days. How can I keep the weight off without denying myself all the pleasures of eating? Do I have to stop eating the foods that I love, especially sugar, permanently? Verygoodquestion; Ibelievethatyouwillhavemorepleasure eatingdelicious, whole, rea l food than eating any junk food. Y ou will not only feel better and enjoy food more, but your metabolism will improve and you'll have relief from many chronic symptoms. Y ou may also avoid the common diseases of aging. Your deep-fr ied hamburgers, then yes, you're probably going to have to give those up. Y ou can't continue to put junk in and expect to feel good and have lifelong health. it the 80 / 20 rule.) If 90% of the time you pay attention to eating high-quality, whole, real foods, then 10% of the time you can have that ice-cream cone or dessert or even a Cinnabon. But when you make those choices, I encourage you to pay attention to how you The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 148 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCfeelafterward,becauseyoumaynotwanttodoitagain. Recognizethatit'snotlifelongdeprivation,butamatterofmoderation,balance, understanding how your body works, and learning how to work with it. If you do that, you won't have a problem. The biggest hurdle is the initial 2to 3 days of detoxification and changing your metabolism. Itisimportanttobecarefulatthebeginningoftheprogram.Afterthat,yourbodywill seek its natural balance and rhythm. Does this program work for people who are over 50, 60, or 70? Are there special considerations that need to be made for people over this age? Well, absolutely! This program works for everybody, whether you're 7 or 70. The key is that it works with the basic rules of biology. It works with the underlying causes of disease and obesity, so it is absolutely for everybody. The question is, Are there any special considerations that need to be made? This is really connected to the next question people have. People understand that their metabolism normally slows down after about the age of 50, and one person wanted to know, \"Is this true and do you have any recommendations for people over 50 who are trying to lose weight?\" What happens as you age? If you are getting older, there are changes that happen in your body. For example, you do lose muscle more easily. If you're 25 and you don't exercise for a month and want to run 5 miles, you can do it. But if you're 55 and you don't exercise for a month and try to run 5 miles, you're going to have a harder time. There is a natural decline as we age: however, that is almost entirely preventable if we take care of ourselves. As you age you need to invest more time and energy in your health because you tend to lose muscle very easily and have more trouble controlling blood sugar and insulin, thyroid hormone, and other hormones. However, with simple, daily deposits into your health bank account, you can easily prevent the common decline seen with aging. So, yes you can absolutely do this at any age. And yes, it is a little harder as you get older. Y ou may have to do a little more work, build more muscle, eat a bit more carefully, get more rest, and deal with stress more effectively, but those things can sustain you and keep you vigorous and active long into your 80s, 90s, and beyond. If I'm taking any medications, should I be aware of any adverse interactions between my medicine and the supplements that you recommend? Medicationscanaffectnutritionalstatus,andyoursupplementsmayaffectyour medications. Y ou should review your supplement intake with a nutritionally educated physician or nutritionist.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 149 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCMoreconcerningtomethanhowmedicationsmightbeaffectedbysupplements (which is rare) is how medications can affect your nutritional state. For example, acid- blocking drugs can interfere with your ability to absorb B12. And certain drugs may interfere with other nutrients. Food, nutrients, and herbs can absolutely interact. But for the most part, taking a multivitamin, fish oil, and calcium magnesium has no danger to it and causes no adverse interactions. Beware of interactions, look at your medications, maybe do a little homework, and talk to your physician. But for the most part, the basic nutritional supplementation is extremely safe. How can I exercise less and lose more weight? It seems unbelievable, but it's true. If we exercise smarter not longer, it will have a different effect on metabolism. The way to exercise smarter not longer is interval training. This is what athletes use to increase their performance. That extra edge is available not just to highly trained athletes, it's available to everybody. It's simply a matter of alternating high levels of exertion with lower levels of exertion. I describe how to do this in UltraMetabolism. The effect is to increase the rate at which you burn calories, not just while you exercise but all day. So, yes, you can exercise less and lose more weight. If you're over 50 and haven't been exercising or you smoke or have diabetes or high blood pressure, you should have a stress test before you start. What data do you have that proves I will truly be able to keep the weight off if I follow the program? I recently wrote a chapter on dietary influences on health for The Textbook of Functional Medicine. In that chapter, there are 350 medical references I cite. In that chapter, I outline, step-by-step, how food is not only calories, but also information. I also discuss how food talks to our genes and turns on messages of health and weight loss. Real,whole,high-qualityfoodmayhelpustoavoidthedeep-rootedconditionsthat lead to disease. This is firmly based on science. I also have my own data from my medical practice. I have documented the changes in my patients' blood work; reduction of blood sugar and inflammation; and improvement inthyroidfunction,metabolism,anddetoxification.Muchofthemedicalliteratureonnutrition has been ignored by conventional medicine. For the last 20 years, I have been studying this rich treasure trove of data on health and nutrition. Nutrition gets second-rate status in the medical profession. It's ironic. This is the most important thing that determines health and disease, and yet there's no medical specialty that addresses it.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 150 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCThere are a group of dedicated scientists and practitioners trying to change this. I'm on theboardoftheInstituteforFunctionalMedicine.Itisanonprofitorganizationcreatedby Dr. Jeffrey Bland to educate physicians in a new model of medicine. Our goal is to educate 15,000 physicians by 2010 to understand how to take this revolutionary medical data and incorporate it into the practice of medicine now. Current scientific discoveries take 20 years to become incorporated into the practice of medicine. This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Unfortunately, our current health care system (which should be known as a disease care system) is not able to incorporate these findings into its existing structure. That is why I feel that it's so important for me to work with other doctors, do research, talk to consumers, and write books to bring awareness to the public that this medical revolution is here, it is now, and it is available to us. We don't have to wait for the future. Inaddition,TheCenterforMind-BodyMedicinehasanexceptionalcoursedesigned toeducatephysiciansaboutintegratingnutritionintotheirpracticecalled\"FoodasMedicine,\"codirectedbymynutritionist,KathieSwift.(www.cmbm.org ). I've been on yo-yo dieting plans for a long time now. How do I know that this program will not only help me lose weight, but keep it off for good? While The UltraSimple Diet is a quick start into a healthy way of living, it's not a quick fix, despite the fact that you can lose up to 10 pounds in one week. It is the beginning of a process of reprogramming your body for life. It is a way for you to understand how your body works. Once you learn how to work with your body rather than against it, you can maintain weight loss and good health. Y ou can always slip back into bad habits, increased stress, lack of exercise, and bad eating. And you might slip back. I find the biggest trigger to fall away from caring for yourselfisstress.Mostpeoplecanmanagetheirbiologybetterwhenthey'renotstressed.The recommendations for journaling, stress reduction, sleep, and breathing are powerful tools you can use to keep you on track.

We need to wind down, calm ourselves, and sleep adequately. Not getting enough sleep is a significant cause of metabolic imbalances. Getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night is critical. These are some of the things you can do to arrest the yo-yo dieting pattern that people fall into. Look at The UltraSimple Diet as a way of getting your health and your lifebackontrack.UltraMetabolismisawayoflife\u2014alifestylethatcanhelpyoucorrectthe underlying issues that plague most of us in this society. That includes the 125 million The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 151 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCAmericans with chronic disease: heart disease, diabetes, dementia, cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, and so on. Also, two-thirds of us overweight and more than 30% are obese. This is an epidemic. It's a juggernaut that's not going to stop until we take control. We have to do it on a personal level and we have to do it on a political level. These are things that require persistent efforts. If we work collectively as citizens we can make a difference. The cost of some of the foods is really beyond my budget. What shortcuts can I take to save money? Studies show that eating healthy is not more expensive. And when you're paying for your pharmaceutical medications in the latter part of your life because you lived a life that hasn't created health, then you're going to really be paying for it. And your children will be paying for it too. There is no free ride. ket, and it's not built into the price of these foods. We're paying it as a society, we're paying it in our health care system (in our health insurance), and we are paying it in the goods and services we use for treating disease. It is important to see that it's not factored into the cost of foods we see on the label. With that said, eating whole, real foods doesn't have to be expensive. Whole grains, beans, and vegetables are generally inexpensive, and you can buy them in bulk. In fact they are a bargain, if you take into account the amount of nutrients in those foods compared to processed and junk food. Wal-Mart an dSaf ewayar eno an ab undance of whole foods. It is important to look at all the choices you make and deliberately choose how to spend your health dollars. Think about the cost of your lattes and your Diet Cokes and the convenience foods you buy here and there. The cost adds up, and these choices do not serve you. By doing a little bit of preparation and cooking ahead, you can cook great food and save a lot of money. How important is breakfast, and what should I eat for this meal? Breakfast is probably the most important meal of the day, because it sets you up for the entire day. People who eat breakfast sustain long-term weight loss. In a study of 3,000 people who sustained a weight loss of 70 pounds and kept it off for 6 or more years, all but 4% ate breakfast. The other thing they had in common is that they exercised more than people who didn't keep the weight off. That was it\u2014eating breakfast and exercising. So breakfast, regardless of anything else you do, is important. Why? Because it sets up your metabolism for the entire day.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 152 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCIt's important to eat protein for breakfast as in a protein shake, eggs, nuts, or yogurt (if you are allergic to dairy, there are soy yogurts now). This is critical for setting up your metabolism to work the rest of the day. Even if you hard-boil some eggs the night before, put them in the fridge, and run out the door the next day with a bag of 2 hard-boiled eggs to eat on the road, it's better than not eating anything. Plan in advance and you can even have something quick and tasty like a protein shake or an UltraShake. What recommendations do you have for menopause, and what do you prescribe to help the symptoms of menopause? The UltraSimple Diet helps control inflammation and toxicity, both of which are contributors topos tmenopausal weig htgain.Mo vingontoUlt raMetabolism, which is a hormonally balanced way of eating, will help you cope with changes that occur around menopause. This way of life provides fiber, omega-3 fats, and low-glycemic-load foods so hel p, because they promote menopausal symptoms and weight gain. Addressing stress is also critical. Other parts of the program I recommend\u2014flax seeds, broccoli and other fresh vegetables, soy foods, and wild fish\u2014all help control the symptoms of menopause. I've been taking care of menopausal women for a long time, and I would say that only 10% of the time do I have to use something other than food, lifestyle changes, or herbs (such as bio-identical hormones) to help me address my patients' menopausal symptoms. It is very important to understand that the principles I've outlined in The UltraSimple Diet and UltraMetabolism are designed for everyone because they were designed to support and enhance the body's normal core functions. If we work with the body, rather than against it, by providing the body with what it needs to thrive, it will thank us, our waistlines will be thinner, our lives will be longer, and we'll feel much better and healthier. How do I eliminate allergies? As I described in Chapter 4, there are two types of food allergies\u2014acute and delayed. Conventional allergists using desensitization allergy shots given over a pea nuts or shellfish or environmental allergies. The delayed allergies usually arise because of a leaky gut and are not permanent. They can be reduced or eliminated by healing the leaky gut. This involves eliminating the allergenic foods for 90 days while eating a whole-foods, high-fiber diet and taking probiotics, vitamins and minerals, and omega-3 fats to heal the gut lining. Some of these reactions may remain, but the tri How ever, they can become a problem when eaten on a regular basis.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 153 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCWhat are the sizes and amounts of meals I should have throughout the day and why? The size of the meals depends on the size of the person and your metabolic rate. The minimum number of calories you need to sustain your body is called your day). However, I recommend tuning into your body's signals, needs, and natural appetite instead of counting calories. Once you eliminate sugar and allergenic foods, your body's appetite control systems will regain balance and you can then eat when you are hungry and stop when you feel gently satisfied. There is no calorie counting on The UltraSimple Diet orwh enyo uar eliv ingth eUl traMetabolism lifes tyle. What can I do to rid my body of harmful toxins? I describe in detail how to avoid toxins in Section 6. Basically eating organic, whole foods; drinking clean water; having daily bowel movements; and sweating daily will go a long way toward keeping your detoxification system functioning well. In addition, taking the essential supplements I recommend along with a liver detox- supportive formula can help your body get rid of toxins over the long term. A wonderful way to get rid of stored petrochemical toxins and metals is an infrared sauna. If you are very toxic, you will need the help of a physician trained in functional or environmental medicine. I have bad eating habits; when should I eat my meals? Eat your meals according the schedule outlined in The UltraSimple Diet. Y ou don't have to follow the times exactly, but make an effort to follow the general anced, eat less, and lose more weight. I want to lose my belly fat, what should I do? Simply follow The UltraSimple Diet\u2014the fat will take care of itself. The biggest cause of belly fat is sugar and refined carbohydrates along with stress, and the program outlined in The UltraSimple Diet takes care of both.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 154 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCIf I am taking other supplements, how can I integrate the supplements you recommend? I encourage you to seek out and find the best-quality supplements (see Section 7 for guidance) because you will be taking these daily for the rest of your life. If you are taking a multivitamin or calcium product, be sure they conform to the guidelines I outline in Section 7. Y ou don't want to be ingesting coloring agents or chemical preservatives in your supplements every day for the rest of your life. If you are taking good-quality supplements regularly, then you can safely add the supplements in the enhanced program to your regimen for the week and for a few weeks afterward. Infact,al lofth ethin ox-supportive herbs\u2014can all be taken safely over the long term if you find them helpful. Why are bowel movements so important? If I am constipated on the program what should I do? Y our body is designed to eliminate toxins through the bowels. Imagine if you never flushed the toilet or took out the garbage. Y our house would be very toxic very soon. Something similar happens to your body when you don't have regular bowel movements. Follow the guidelines in Chapter 5 of The UltraSimple Diet to deal with constipation. They work for nearly everyone. What if I don't like vegetables\u2014I mean what if I really don't like them? Myguessisthatifyoureallydon'tlikevegetables, thenitislikelyyouhavenothad them p repared in delicious ways. Overcooked, canned, or processed vegetables taste horrible. It is also likely your palate has become habituated to fats and sugars and will crave those substances shunning whole, real food. Y ou will be surprised at how you can appreciate, enjoy, and savor the foods you never thought you would. Just try it. Can I use frozen veggies instead of fresh? Can I use canned broth instead of homemade? If not, why not? If you want to do the program and don't have time to cook vegetables and broth, there are substitutes. I recommend a variety of frozen vegetables from Cascadian Farm and the low-sodium, organic vegetable broth from Pacific Foods. Do you have any specific recommendations for good yoga DVDs? Yes.TrytheKripalu YogaGentleortheKripalu YogaDynamic videos.Theyare excel lent, easy-to-follow classes by highly skilled yoga teachers.The Ultra Simple Diet Companion Guide 155 Copyright \u00a9 2007 UltraWellness, llCWhy are all these restrictions necessary?

Y ou spend a lifetime in behaviors that don't support your health\u2014poor-quality food, junk food, caffeine, alcohol, stress, lack of exercise, and more. For just one week I encourage people to do ALL the things at once that can transform their health practically overnight. Then what you choose to do will be up to you. But you will know how bad you have felt all along (which most people think is normal) and how great you can really feel. Why are the foods included in this program okay? The foods chosen for this program are low-allergy, whole, organic, fresh foods with scientifically proven anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties. They are designed to provide the right information to your cells and to your genes to turn on messages of health and healing and turn off messages of sickness and disease. Choosing the right foods provides healing medicine for your body. Are there any problems with using stevia as a natural sweetener? Stevia is plant-based sweetener. It can be used in moderation; however, I recommend avoiding any type of sweetener (artificial or otherwise) that can stimulate your cravings for sweets. Give yourself this opportunity for one week and watch your cravings disappear.156 COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2007 ULTRAWELLNESS, LLCC/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc T/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc/s.sc Consider this equipment a toolkit for taking care of your body.

Obesity is not a single clinical disorder. Obesity is acomplex chronic illness resulting from the interplayamong genetics, environment, and lifestyle. Emergingscientific concepts provide a new basis for under-standing the multiple causes of obesity as well as the underlying mechanisms involved in weight dysregulation. While mostobesity can be effectively treated for compliant patients, using afocused lifestyle intervention based on a whole-foods, low-glycemic-load, phytonutrient-rich diet combined with exercise and stress man-agement, there are patients who do not respond predictably tonormally successful interventions. A novel hypothesis linking envi-ronmental and internal toxins to disruptions of key mechanismsinvolved in weight regulation may explain treatment resistance inobesity. The key biological systems involved in obesity (and all dis-eases) that are altered by toxins are the neuro-endocrine-immune mitochondrial energetics and redox status. Obesity providesan illustrative example of new navigational tools for diagnosis andtherapy of chronic illness based on a paradigm that focuses not on dis-ease or symptoms, but on cause and mechanism. This new frameworkand methodological approach can be applied to any chronic diseaseand provides an opportunity to integrate fragmentary scientific dis-coveries into a cohesive whole that creates a new clinical roadmap. This paper will explore a novel hypothesis that links obesity and toxins; we will discuss how one particular disease and the effect of oneunderlying cause can create a clinically relevant, holographic view ofphysiology. Alterations in thyroid metabolism and receptor function,central appetite dysregulation, oxidative-stress-mediated effects via nuclear factor kappa B(NF B) are all mechanisms by which toxins create alterations in metabolism and finely-tuned weight regulatory mechanisms. These systems are not discrete entities but systems in the true sense of the word - interlocking, interactive, dynamic, overlapping net-works of biochemical and physiological informational spheres of func-tional relationships. Multiple patterns of genetic, physiological, andbiochemical dysfunction are linked to obesity, including genetic poly-morphisms, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress,neuro-endocrine-immune dysfunction, especially autonomic the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, nutritionaldeficiencies or excesses, and toxins. The nature, causes, and remedia-tion of obesity can be seen through the prism of any one of these pat-terns. The focus here will be on how toxins mediate their influencethrough all these mechanisms.WEIGHT REGULATION AND TOXINS: UNDERLYINGMECHANISMS The influence of toxins on metabolism occurs through 5 key mechanisms: hormonal regulation, neuro-regulatory mechanisms,immuno-regulatory mechanisms, mitochondrial function, and oxida-tive stress. Toxins can alter the hormonal regulation of weight, aprocess that involves insulin, leptin, thyroid, cortisol, adiponectin,resistin, sex hormones, and cholecystokinin (CCK). Toxins alter function leading rate.Important neuro-regulatory mechanisms affected by toxins includehypothalamic satiety modulation through effects on peripheral andcentral inhibitors and stimulators of appetite, including leptin, corti-sol, andweight-control insulin resistance, and on themelanocortin receptor (MCR) system altering central appetite regula-tion. Counter-regulatory signals triggered by inflammation such assuppressors (SOCS) induce stress influencesweight via NF B-mediated mechanisms of gene transcription that control insulin resistance and inflammation. Other mechanisms mayinclude direct effects of toxins on hepatic control of lipid and glucosemetabolism, and on inflammatory cytokines. CAN FOREIGN MOLECULES CAUSE OBESITY? It is clear that ingesting foreign molecules can lead to obesity, including medications. While most drugs are not truly toxins, certain drugs can have toxic effects and cause weight gain\u2014psychotropicmedications in particular have been shown to promote weight gain.monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, lithium, sertraline, and paroxetine haveall been shown to promote weight gain through various mechanisms.Hormones such as megestrol are used to increase appetite in cancerpatients. Billions of dollars are pouring into obesity drug research tofind the magic molecule that will burn fat or reduce appetite.However, affecting one pathway in a complex cybernetic system willlikely fail because of countless counter-regulatory mechanisms. It isclear that medications can affect our weight and may play a role inobesity for some people. But it is important to recognize that, if med-ications can influence weight, then certainly other foreign chemicals,including environmental toxins, can cause weight gain. Environmental toxins interfere with metabolism, overload hepatic detoxification systems, disrupt central weight-control sys-tems, promote insulin resistance, alter circadian rhythms, activate thestress response, interfere with thyroid function, increase inflamma-tion, damage mitochondria, and lead to obesity. Most researchershave largely ignored the effects of environmental chemicals on metab-olism. Still, a few researchers have started connecting the dots linking Systems Biology, Toxins, Obesity, and Functional Medicine Mark Hyman, MD13th International Symposium of The Institute for Functional Medicine Managing Biotransformation: The Metabolic, Genomic, and Detoxication Balance Points S 135Hyman toxins with the obesity epidemic. While research linking environmen- tal toxins and impaired detoxification to obesity remains in its infan-cy, these factors can no longer be overlooked. Detoxification is acentral component in long-term effective weight management andcreating a healthy metabolism. LIVING IN A SEA OF TOXINS: THE PROBLEM Why should we worry about toxins unless we work with toxic chemicals or spray pesticides for a living? Isn't exposure minimal? Unfortunately, risks of exposure are substantial, pose significant pub-lic health risks, and can no longer be ignored. We live in a sea of tox-ins. Every single person and animal on the planet contains residues oftoxic chemicals or metals in their tissues. Eighty thousand new chemi-cals have been introduced since the turn of the 20th century and mosthave never been tested for safety or for synergistic actions. TheCenters for Disease Control issued a report on human exposure toenvironmental chemicals. They assessed human blood or urine levelsfor 116 chemicals (and there were thousands more for which testswere not conducted) as part of the National Health and NutritionExamination Survey. 1While they found high levels of toxins in some, and low levels in many more, the study, in isolation, may not tell thewhole story. Why? Because these chemical toxins move quickly fromthe blood into storage sites\u2014mostly fat tissue, organs, and bones\u2014sothe blood or urine levels underestimate the total toxic load. Both weight gain (because of stored toxins) and the total toxic load canfrustrate attempts at weight loss by impairing two key metabolicorgans\u2014the liver and the thyroid, by damaging the mitochondria\u2014the site of energy metabolism, by affecting neuroendocrine signaling,and by increasing inflammation and oxidative stress. FAT AS A STORAGE DEPOT FOR FAT SOLUBLE TOXINS The Environmental Protection Agency has monitored human exposure to toxic environmental chemicals since 1972 when they began the National Human Adipose Tissue Survey. This study evaluates the lev-els of various toxins in the fat tissue from cadavers and elective surgeries.Five of what are known to be the most toxic chemicals were found in100% of all samples (OCDD or octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, styrene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, xylene, and ethylphenol\u2014toxic chemicals from indus-trial pollution that damage the liver, heart, lungs, and nervous system).Nine more chemicals were found in 91-98% of samples: benzene, toluene,ethylbenzene, DDE (a breakdown product of DDT, the pesticide bannedin the US since 1972), three dioxins, and one furan. Polychlorinatedbiphenyls (PCBs) were found in 83% of the population. A Michiganstudy found DDT in over 70% of 4 years olds, probably received throughbreast milk. With the global economy, we may be eating food that waspicked a day before in Guatemala, Indonesia, or Asia, where there arenot the same restrictions on the use of pesticides as there are in theUnited States. Many of these chemicals are stored in fat tissue, makinganimal products concentrated sources. One hundred percent of beef iscontaminated with DDT, as is 93% of processed cheese, hot dogs,bologna, turkey, and ice cream. WHERE DO TOXINS COME FROM? Exposure to toxins comes from two main sources: the environ- ment (external toxins) and the gut (breakdown products of our metabolism, or internal toxins). Both can overload endogenous detox-ification mechanisms. External Toxins: The Dangers from Without The external toxins include chemical toxins and heavy metals. TheTesting for Toxins and Detoxification Function Genetic testing of detoxification pathways for phase I and phase II SNPs Detoxification challenge test (provocations with caffeine, aspirin, acetaminophen) Measurement of detoxification enzymes - Reduced glutathione - Glutathione peroxidase - super oxide dismutase (SOD) Heavy metals - RBC or whole blood - Hair analysis - Chelation challenge with DMPS or DMSA Urinary organic acids - Specific compounds measured, including sulfates, pyroglutamate, orotate, and others, can give clues to problems with detoxification pathways. Chemical antibodies to various toxins and metals (can occasionally be useful) Organophosphates: identified through a 24-hour urine collection test Mold and mycotoxin antibodies IgG food sensitivity testing Celiac testing (IgG and anti-gliadin antibodies, tTG IgA) Digestive stool analysis for dysbiosis Tests for hidden infections (Lyme, H. pylori, etc.) Practical Suggestions for Patients Remove Toxins Eat organic food and animal products to avoid petrochemical pesticides, herbicides, hormones, and antibiotics. Drink filtered water (reverse osmosis or carbon filter). HEPA/ULPA filters and ionizers can be helpful in reducing dust, molds, volatile organic compounds, and other sourcesof indoor air pollution. Clean and monitor heating systems for release of carbon monox- ide, the most common cause of death by poisoning in America. Have houseplants that help filter the air. Air out your dry cleaning before wearing it. Avoid excess exposure to environmental petrochemicals (garden chemicals, dry cleaning, car exhaust, second-hand smoke). Reduce or eliminate the use of toxic household and personal care products (aluminium-containing underarm deodorant,antacids, and pots and pans). Remove allergens and dust from your home as much as possible. Minimize electromagnetic radiation (EMR) from radios, TVs, and microwave ovens. Reduce ionizing radiation (from sun exposure or medical tests such as X-rays). Reduce heavy metal exposure (predatory and river fish, water, lead paint, thimerosal-containing products, etc.). Improve Elimination of Toxins Have 1-2 bowel movements a day. Drink 6-8 glasses of water a day. Sweat regularly. - Use exercise to help you sweat regularly.- Use steam baths or saunas - infrared saunas may be even more beneficial. Continued, p.5813th International Symposium of The Institute for Functional Medicine S 136 Managing Biotransformation: The Metabolic, Genomic, and Detoxication Balance PointsHyman heavy metals that cause the most ill health are lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, nickel, and aluminum. Chemical toxins include volatile organiccompounds (VOCs), solvents (cleaning materials, formaldehyde,toluene, benzene), medications, alcohol, pesticides, herbicides, and foodadditives. Infections (hepatitis C virus) and mold toxins (sick buildingsyndrome) are other common sources of toxins. Our modern refined dietcan be considered toxic because it places an extra burden on detoxifica-tion systems through excessive consumption of sugar, high-fructose cornsyrup (the two most important causes of elevated liver function tests),trans fatty acids, alcohol, caffeine, aspartame, foods made with genetical-ly modified organisms (GMOs), and the various plastics, pathogens, hor-mones, and antibiotics found in our food supply. Internal Toxins: Danger from Within Internal toxins include microbial compounds (from bacteria, yeast, or other organisms), and the breakdown products of normal protein metabolism. Bacteria and yeast in the gut produce wasteproducts, metabolic by-products and cellular debris that can interferewith many body functions and lead to increased inflammation andoxidative stress. These include endotoxins, toxic amines, toxic deriva-tives of bile, and various carcinogenic substances such as putrescineand cadaverine. Lastly, by-products of normal protein metabolism,including urea and ammonia, require detoxification. OBESITY AND TOXICITY: IS THERE A CONNECTION? Effects on Thyroid and Metabolic Rate Many people reach a plateau during weight loss. After the loss of a few pounds, it is often difficult to shed more weight. What is it thatimpedes weight loss and interferes with metabolism? A review paper,\"Energy balance and pollution by organochlorines and polychlorinatedbiphenyls,\" 2published in Obesity Reviews in 2003 outlines the effects of toxins on metabolic rate and weight regulation via various mechanisms.The authors conclude that pesticides (organochlorines) and PCBs (fromindustrial pollution) released from the fat tissue, where they are typical-ly stored, during weight loss lower the metabolic rate. The authors goon to conclude that we should lose a little weight to reduce our risk ofcardiovascular and degenerative diseases, but not too much because wecould poison our metabolism. If there were no way to facilitate endoge-nous detoxification mechanisms, this would be a sound conclusion;however there are multiple ways to upregulate all phases of detoxifica-tion and eliminate both endogenously-liberated and exogenous toxins. How do the chemical toxins interfere with metabolism? The researchers in the above-mentioned study on the link between chemi-cal toxins and obesity reviewed 63 scientific studies and describedmany mechanisms. First, people with a higher body mass index (BMI)store more toxins because they have more fat. Those toxins interferewith many normal aspects of metabolism, including causing a reduc-tion in thyroid hormone levels, and increased excretion of thyroidhormones by the liver. Toxins also compete with the thyroid hor-mones by blocking the thyroid receptors, and by vying for the thyroidtransport proteins. Toxins metabolic rateare inversely related to organochlorine levels. Thus, it is clear thatorganochlorine pesticides and PCBs lower thyroid hormone levels,interfere with their function, and slow the metabolic rate. Toxins Alter Mitochondrial Function, Redox Status, and Cytokine Function In addition, toxins damage the mitochondria, increase oxidative Regular exercise, yoga, or lymphatic massage can improve lymph flow and help flush toxins out of your tissues into yourcirculation so they can be detoxified. Increase Fiber Intake Eat more beans, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds. Feed Y our Gut with Healthy Bacteria Taking probiotics such as lactobacillus and bifidobacter species helps normalize gut flora and reduce endotoxins (tox-ins produced by imbalances in gut bacteria). Foods and Phytochemicals that Boost Detoxification Try to eat at least one cup of cruciferous vegetables daily. Eat a few cloves of garlic every day or take a garlic supplement. Try decaffeinated green tea in the morning. Try fresh vegetable juices including carrots, celery, cilantro, beets, parsley, and ginger. Try prepared herbal detoxification teas containing a mixture of Eat high-quality, sulfur-containing proteins - eggs, whey pro- tein, garlic, onions. Consume citrus peels, caraway, and dill oil (they contain limonene). Consume bioflavonoids in grapes, berries, and citrus fruits. Eat cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, collards, kale, Brussels sprouts). Consume dandelion greens to help liver detoxification, improve the flow of bile, and increase urine flow. Eat celery to increase the flow of urine and aid in detoxification. Consume cilantro, which may help remove heavy metals. Consume rosemary, which has carnosol, a potent booster of detoxification enzymes. Consume curcuminoids (turmeric and curry) for their antiox- idant and anti-inflammatory action. Consume burdock root for aid in detoxification. Consume chlorophyll in dark green leafy vegetables and in wheat grass. Take pycnogenol (found in grape seeds) in supplement form for support of detoxification and circulation. Supplements for Detoxification The Basics Take a high potency multi-vitamin and mineral formula. Take extra-buffered vitamin C 1000-4000 mg a day with mineral ascorbates in powder, capsule, or tablets during periods of increased detoxification. (This can cause loose stools. If it does, just reduce the dose or stop.) Take milk thistle (silymarin) 70 to 210 mg a day. Supplement with essential fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acids), 1000-2000 mg a day. Additional Supplements (use under medical supervision) N-acetylcysteine 500 to 1000 mg a day Amino acids (taurine 500 mg twice a day, glycine 500 mg twice a day) Alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg to 600 mg a day Carnitine 1000 to 2000 mg a day in divided doses Bioflavonoids (citrus, pine bark, grape seed, green tea)Continued from, p.5713th International Symposium of The Institute for Functional Medicine Managing Biotransformation: The Metabolic, Genomic, and Detoxication Balance Points S 137Hyman stress, and reduce their ability to burn fat and calories by inhibiting thermogenesis through effects on fatty acid oxidation.Organochlorines alter skeletal muscle oxidative enzyme activities.Enzymes of transport dehydrogenase (HADH) and cyclooxygenase (COX),both Toxins also lead to decreasedcapacity for fatty acid utilization in skeletal muscle. Oxidative stress is both a cause and effect of obesity. Toxins increase oxidative stress and affect redox signaling. Redox and mitochondrial function.Activation of NFB (a gene transcription factor) is mediated by redoxbalance and is a final common pathway for obesity and many otherchronic illnesses. 3All of these actions cause both weight gain and resistance to weight loss. Toxins may also influence metabolism and obesity through cytokine-mediated mechanisms. Toxins activate neutrophils.4Increases in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- )and interleukin 6 (IL-6) induced by toxins promote insulin resistance via effects on PPAR and NFB.5 Leptin resistance is also triggered by inflammation via SOCS.6 Detoxification Enzyme Polymorphisms and Obesity The effect of toxins on an individual is determined, in part, by the polymorphisms of phase I and phase II detoxification enzymes.Highly prevalent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of glu-tathione transferase enzymes predispose to increased toxic loads.Detoxification of heavy metals is an important task for the body. Itdepends on specific proteins and enzymes that bind the metals andtransport them out of the cells. In one recent study, mice bred withoutthe protein (metallothionein) that is necessary for heavy metal detoxi-fication gained more weight over their lifetime than mice that couldeliminate the metals. They were more sensitive to the effects of toxicmetals and oxidative stress. Toxins Impair Central Appetite Regulation Toxins have many effects. Besides directly lowering thyroid hor- mone levels, metabolic rate, and fat burning (fatty acid oxidation), they can damage the mechanisms by which hormonal and neuro-regulatorysignals control our appetite and behavior. These signals are finely chore-ographed and sensitive to environmental inputs. To briefly review, thehypothalamic appetite-control system is centered in the arcuate nucle-us. It receives peripheral feedback from leptin, insulin, PYY, andadiponectin. Central inhibition of food by pro-opi-omelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated tran-script (CART). Central and agouti-related peptide receptors, MC3R MC4R, play a crucial role inappetite control. Specifically, -MSH binds to MCR, suppresses appetite, stimulates the thyroid axis, and increases energy expenditure,brown fat temperature, and sympathetic activity. It is inhibited by TNF-. Other downstream control sites also exist in the related areas of the brain. Reward centers also play a role and are targets for new drugresearch including the endocannabinoid and serotonin receptors. 9 Leptin resistance is found in obesity. Leptin's inhibitory effect on appetite is impaired by toxins, leading to leptin resistance andincreased hunger. species feed-forward cycle. Toxins mayinhibit satiety effects of leptin, leading to increasing hyperleptinemia. Researchers treated rats with a neurotoxin that damaged anoth-er critical appetite control system (the melanocortin system). 10The toxin lowered levels of alpha-melanocortin-stimulating hormone ( - MSH), which acts as a brake on appetite.11This pathway may be a missing link in understanding the effects of toxins on obesity throughthe interaction transcription. TNF- downregu- lates genes that are required for normal insulin action, has a directinhibitory effect on insulin signaling, and induces elevated free fattyacids via stimulation of lipolysis. A key effect of TNF- is the negative regulation of PPAR , an important insulin-sensitizing nuclear recep- tor. Neurotoxins also may directly inhibit -MSH, leading to hyper- phagia and increased body weight. 14,15 Human studies complement research from animal studies. One study examined prenatal and breast milk exposure to PCBs and DDE(a by-product of DDT). 16Researchers followed 594 children who had their prenatal and breast milk exposures to PCBs and DDE measured.At puberty, children with the highest exposures were larger, and girlswere an average of 12 pounds heavier. In a second study, a group ofresearchers from Laval University in Quebec found that, duringweight loss, those who released the most organochlorines from theirfat stores had the slowest metabolism after weight loss. 17Their expla- nation for the decreased thermogenesis, after taking into account allother possible factors, was the exposure to pesticides. In yet anotherstudy, the rise of toxins during weight loss in men inhibited normalmitochondrial function and reduced their ability to burn calories,retarding further weight loss. 18Weight loss seems to prevent further weight loss, and one of the key mechanisms may be the release ofinternally-stored toxins that occurs during weight loss. Hormone Disrupters: Hormonal Chaos The dance of hormones is critical for balancing your metabo- lism. Environmental chemicals and heavy metals are well known hor- mone disrupters. A Tufts University professor, Sheldon Krimsky, inhis book Hormonal Chaos, the Scientific and Social Origins of the Environmental Endocrine Hypothesis, has extensively reviewed theresearch in this field. Low levels of these toxins, levels far below whatare considered acceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency,interfere with our normal hormone balance, including sex hormones,which may lead to early puberty in girls and an increase in hormonaldisorders. Toxins can affect many of the major weight-control estrogens, testosterone, cortisol, interfere with our stress response(our autonomic nervous system), and alter the normal circadianrhythms 19that control our eating behavior. These connections were explored at a conference co-sponsored by the National Institute ofEnvironmental Health Sciences and Duke University entitled, Obesity: Developmental Origins and Environmental Influences. 20While we still have much to learn about this connection, we can no longer ignorethe effect of environmental toxins on weight. It is certainly not theonly factor in our obesity epidemic, or in any one person's strugglewith weight, but it must be considered in the evaluation and treat-ment of obesity. Fatty Liver: Cause or Effect in Weight Gain Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (fatty liver) is the most common liver disease in America, affecting 20% of the population. The major cause is not medication, a virus, or pollution. It is the most abundanttoxin in our diet: sugar. Increases in sugar or refined carbohydrate consumption increase insulin and insulin resistance, which leads to13th International Symposium of The Institute for Functional Medicine S 138 Managing Biotransformation: The Metabolic, Genomic, and Detoxication Balance PointsHyman the accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes. Increased fat inside the hepatocytes is produced from sugar, refined flour products, and highfructose corn syrup. The sugar is turned into intracellular triglyc-erides. Excess sugar calories also increase oxidative stress and furtherdamage the mitochondria. Damaged mitochondria can't effectivelyburn fat or calories, which leads to a slower metabolism and moreweight gain. A fatty liver further impairs detoxification. A fatty liver isalso an inflamed liver; it is called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH), a form of hepatitis caused by insulin resistance. A fatty liverproduces more inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, toxins. OPTIMIZING DETOXIFICATION: A NOVEL STRATEGY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OBESITY While still a hypothesis, the emerging evidence forms a plausible link between toxins and obesity. To review, toxins alter metabolism,interfere with key weight-control mechanisms, disrupt endocrinefunction, damage the mitochondria, increase inflammation andoxidative stress, lower thyroid hormones, and alter circadian rhythmsand the autonomic nervous system. Using a comprehensive approachto obesity, including the assessment and treatment of toxin-mediatedeffects, it is necessary to address this multi-faceted disorder affectingtwo-thirds of Americans. Simple lifestyle choices, as well as medicaldetoxification, can reduce exposure to toxins and enhance mobiliza-tion and elimination of stored and external toxins. Amino Acids, Nutrients, and Phytonutrients in Detoxification The detoxification system relies on the right balance of protein, fats, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals to be effective. All these play a role in facilitating the elimination of toxins. For example,adequate protein is required to supply the amino acids used by theliver to provide glycine, cysteine, and glutamine to synthesize glu-tathione, as well as amino acids critical for many phase II detoxifica-tion pathways including methylation, critical antioxidant anddetoxifier in the body, and one that is easily depleted in the face ofchronic exposure to toxins. Many phytochemicals enhance detoxifica-tion pathways. 21These many turmeric, citrus peels, and even cocoa.Polyphenols found in berries, green tea, and cocoa enhance the genet-ic expression of glutamylcysteine synthetase, which increases intra- cellular glutathione concentration. Hyperthermic Therapy \"Regular use of a sauna or steam bath may impart a similar stress on the cardiovascular system [as exercise], and its regular use may be as effective a means of cardiovascular conditioning and burning calories asregular exercise.\" W. Dean. Effect of sweating. JAMA. 1981;246:623. Heat therapy is an underutilized treatment in medicine. It helps balance the autonomic nervous system, reduce stress, lower blood glucose, increase caloric expenditure, and enhance excretion of pesti-cides and heavy metals through the skin. Sauna therapy is an estab-lished treatment for chemical poisoning. While more research isneeded, a review paper on \"thermal therapy\" suggests many promis-ing effects including a reduction of inflammation and oxidativestress, 22as well as weight loss.23In a 2-week study of 25 obese adults, body weight and body fat were reduced after sauna therapy for 15minutes at 60 degrees Celsius daily, for two weeks, in a far-infraredsauna. One case report described an obese patient who couldn't exer-cise because of knee arthritis and who lost 17.5 kg, decreasing body fatfrom 46% to 35% after 10 weeks of sauna therapy. Sauna therapy hasmany benefits, including increasing autonomic balance throughincreases in heart rate variability, reduction in cardiac arrhythmias,and reduction of oxidative stress, as well as mobilization and excre-tion of toxins. Practical Implications in Obesity: Elimination of Toxins and Maximizing Detoxification In the face of the toxic environment of the 21st century, and with the reality that all living species contain increasing levels ofenvironmental toxins with widespread biologic effects, it is clear thatboth new research to elucidate the mechanisms by which toxinsaffect health and novel clinical strategies for detoxification are need-ed. What follows is an overview of a comprehensive clinical approachto identifying and eliminating toxins (in the broadest sense of factorsthat affect weight and metabolism), as well as maximizing endoge-nous detoxification mechanisms. A broad-based and comprehensive strategy for addressing the obesity epidemic is needed, 24including the implications of new research linking toxins and obesity. Toxins have their impact througheffects on endocrine function, the immune and cytokines; cen-tral neuro-regulatory systems; and mitochondrial and oxidativestress. Strategies for treatment of obesity need to be inclusive ofresearch on meal timing, meal composition, glycemic load, 25phytonu- trient content, reducing inflammation, balancing autonomic functionby reducing stress, 26improving sleep habits and duration, as well as treatments aimed at enhancing mitochondrial function and balancingredox status. In addition, minimizing exposure to toxins and enhanc-ing detoxification can be an integral part of obesity management,especially in treatment-resistant patients. A comprehensive detoxification strategy 27should include the identification and removal of infections, limiting endogenous toxicityby improving digestive function, enhancing blood and lymphatic circu-lation, facilitating phase I and II detoxification pathways, and address-ing the toxic effects of stress. The first step is a thorough clinical evaluation for a history of toxic exposures, including amalgams, fish, mold, occupational expo-sures, and pollution or chemical contamination of water, air, or food.The toxic effects of occult infections, allergens, and medications alsoneed to be considered. Reduction of dietary toxins or chemicals can be helpful in reduc- ing overall toxic load; these may include trans fatty acids, processed foods and suspect additives (aspartame, high fructose corn syrup),sugar and refined flours, salt, caffeine, charbroiled meats, and alcohol.Identifying and eliminating common food allergens such as gluten,dairy, eggs, soy, corn, and yeast may be helpful in reducing the effectsof inflammatory cytokines on weight regulation. Minimizing unneces-sary medications such as acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory or acid-blocking medications can prevent depletion ofhepatic glutathione and reduce altered gut function.Recommendations to eat organic food, drink filtered water, and usean air filter can further limit overall toxic exposures. Common house-hold or environmental exposures can be limited by considering thecauses of sick building syndrome (mediated through the effects ofmycotoxins), garden chemicals, household cleaners, dry cleaning sol-13th International Symposium of The Institute for Functional Medicine Managing Biotransformation: The Metabolic, Genomic, and Detoxication Balance Points S 139Hyman vents, second-hand smoke, plastics and phthalates in food and water containers, toxic molds common in basements and bathrooms, andUV radiation, which can be limited by sunscreen and sun glasses.Heavy metal exposure is also common, including mercury from fish,amalgams, water, latex paint, vaccines, and contact lens solutions;lead from old paint, blinds, and canned foods; and aluminum com-mon in deodorants, antacids, and baking powder. occultinfections is H. pylori, chlamydia, fungal sinusitis, periodontal disease and infect-ed root canals, as well as intestinal dysbiosis from yeast, parasites, andbacteria. Psychosocial stressors can exacerbate the effects of other tox-ins and affect central and peripheral appetite control mechanisms. Optimizing digestive function is important through the elimina- tion of common food allergens and medications, re-inoculation withbeneficial flora (probiotics), and the use of specific nutrients for gutrepair, including essential fatty acids, zinc, and glutamine. Regularelimination is critical to excrete toxins through the bile and can befacilitated by fiber, magnesium, vitamin C, and charcoal. Enhancingblood and lymphatic circulation can be accomplished through aerobicexercise, yoga, massage and body work, sauna and heat therapy, aswell as skin exfoliation and brushing. Facilitation of endogenousdetoxification systems can be accomplished through diet and strategicsupplementation, including the use of specific nutrients, amino acids,and herbs. Useful strategies include a high-potency multi-vitamin andmineral (enzyme cofactors), buffered vitamin C, and regular intake ofphytonutrient-rich foods that facilitate phase I and II detoxification(Brassicas, alliums, lemon peel, green tea, watercress, cocoa, pome-granate, cilantro, and artichoke). Detoxifying herbs include milk this-tle, green tea, and dandelion. Additional supplements that can behelpful include N-acetyl amino omega-3 fatty acids, and adequate monoun-saturated oils are important. Adequate fluid intake to facilitate renaltoxin excretion is also important. Finally, an increased intake of plantfoods can alkalinize the urine, which helps facilitate toxin excretion. SUMMARY By recognizing the role of toxins in obesity and altered function of the neuro-endocrine-immune and mitochondrial and redox sys- tems, and by creating a comprehensive strategy for both the reductionof exposure to and elimination of toxins, as well as the development ofeffective clinical strategies, treatment resistance in obesity may bemore successfully addressed. Further research is needed to explore theclinical relevance and the mechanisms that underlie this hypothesisand to examine clinical detoxification methods. Through the prism offunctional medicine, a context and road map exist for tackling manytreatment-resistant and complex chronic diseases, including obesity. References 1.
