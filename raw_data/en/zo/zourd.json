Other terms for this condition include acid reflux, sour stomach, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or peptic ulcer disease. Common symptoms include that tell-tale burning feeling behind the breastbone, but can also include bloat, burping or flatulence, acidic taste in the mouth, regurgitation, and more. How can chiropractic care help with heartburn? Generally speaking, a chiropractor will work to help you achieve optimum health by freeing you of the dysfunction and restriction that prevents your body from performing optimally. We work to bring the whole body into alignment to promote general wellbeing More specifically, chiropractic therapy can help with heartburn by: - Realigning your spine to take stress off the nerves and allow them to once again function properly. - Strengthening the spinal muscles through adjustments to relieve pressure from the stomach. - Correcting joint dysfunctions or restrictions that can help ensure proper function of the whole body. - Reducing hiatal hernias, which are a leading cause of indigestion. What are some other natural remedies for heartburn?
