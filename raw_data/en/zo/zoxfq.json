We also know that external or internal stimuli including allergies, stress, emotions, nutritional or chemical imbalances, toxins, or others, can interfere with the brain's ability to function properly. The result is that without proper brain function, the body can produce a variety of symptoms or chronic conditions. Through our neurologic and metabolic assessment and care, we move beyond treating symptoms to identifying and treating their sources, in order to restore a healthier more vibrant lifestyle! This involves: - Specific Neurological Testing to develop your customized Neurological Treatments - Getting comprehensive Lab testing and implementing Metabolic Treatments designed for you Drs.
