Detox & Traditional Massage Addiction Reach Home Massage Team offers a combination of Swedish/Deep Tissue massages. Physical, psychological and emotional components must be considered in order to encourage a successful recovery, which makes massage therapy a relaxing and calming treatment option. Addiction changes brain chemistry. Normally, your brain produces a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is a key to pleasure. It is used by your brain to encourage you to continue to do something that is required for survival. Eating and sex are two activities that naturally trigger large dopamine releases in our brains. When dopamine is released we feel good so we want to continue to do that thing so we can continue to feel good. Addictive behaviors trigger a release of dopamine. This release is much higher than what the body can do naturally. Because of the high amount of dopamine produced by the drug you are driven more and more to repeat that behavior. Overt time you become dependent on the drug to release dopamine. When you're going through the withdrawal process your dopamine levels are lower than the average person. Massage helps increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. When given consistently over an extended period of time it causes dopamine levels to increase steadily. It can be used to help normalize the production of dopamine in a person going through the withdrawal process. Massage also decreases stress. Recovering from an addiction puts the body through a tremendous amount of stress. Massage decreases the production of the stress hormone cortisol in the body. It also triggers the parasympathetic nervous system which helps slow breathing and heart rate relaxing the body. Detoxification is an important part of addiction recovery. The remaining drugs in your body must be pushed out to give you a chance of full recovery. Massage also helps with detoxification by increasing the circulation of blood and lymph. This helps the body flush out the toxic chemicals left over from drug abuse more quickly. Massage on its own cannot help someone completely recover from addiction, but combined with the right other therapies, it can make the recovery process easier Massage Therapy offers an abundance of additional benefits including: - Decrease physical muscle pain - Ease medication dependency - Increase joint flexibility /circulation - Promote tissue regeneration - Reduce muscle spasm/cramping - Enhance sleep quality - Improve energy "}
