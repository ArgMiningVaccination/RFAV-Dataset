SERVICES OFFERED [Dietary that can be improved with naturopathic services: Digestive disorders Hormonal issues Fatigue Depression Anxiety Headaches/migraines Muscle pain Cardiovascular conditions Dietary Modification Nutrition is the most fundamental determinant of health. There is no biochemical process that is not correlated with nutrition. Food provides the energy and nutrients you need to be healthy emotionally, mentally, and physically. Hippocrates said, \"Let thy food be thy medicine, and thy medicine be thy food.\" Typical digestion disturbances creating a vast amount of mental health issues include incomplete chewing of food, poor food quality, food sensitivities, food allergies, genetically engineered foods, low hydration status and much more. Nutritional Supplements Our food supply is not entirely perfect. Supplementing your diet with certain vitamins and minerals is important to ensure adequate basic nutrition. Some of the most common nutritional deficiencies seen today include iron, iodine, vitamin D, omega-3 fats, magnesium and others. Any one of these nutritional deficiencies can contribute to an array of mental health issues including poor concentration, depression, fatigue, etc. Over-the-counter and prescription medications can also deplete your body of key nutrients. Botanicals & Herbs Plants have an array of unique constituents that have been researched for different health benefits. Many different botanicals and herbs can calm the nervous system, balance hormones, support digestion, and more. Botanicals and herbs can be taken singly or in combination to address one or multiple health complaints. There are many to choose from! Homeopathy Homeopathic medicine involves different kind of remedies of highly dilute substances of plant, animal or mineral origin. Homeopathy is based on the concept, \"like cures like\" or Law of Similars. These substances which cause symptoms when taken in large doses by healthy individuals, can be used in small amounts to safely and gently eliminate similar symptoms in an unhealthy person. Lifestyle Counseling Breathing, exercise, sleep quality, stress management, mindfulness, spirituality, etc. can all play a heavy role in determining one's health and well-being. These are usually the things we take for granted or ignore. We may even criticize these determinants of health for getting in the way or taking away time from doing things we really want to do instead. But they are just as important if not more important to re-establish the basis for health and maintain balance on a daily basis and long-term basis. Remember \"life is not a race.\" We must take time out to focus on these fundamentally simple but impactful influences.

There are many different styles of massage. Swedish massage is the most common and best-known type of massage on which all other styles of massage are based. Swedish massage usually consists of long gliding strokes, circulation friction, and kneading of muscles. Body Work can be used to increase circulation, improve muscle tone and flexibility, decrease physical pain, enhance immune system, and promote relaxation. Beyond the well-known benefits of massage, people enjoy receiving body work because it often produces feelings of comfort and connection. In addition to the above benefits, studies have shown that symptoms for the following mental health issues may be alleviated with the help of body work: For more information or to schedule an initial visit, contact Dr. Valerie Ripperger by phone at (630) 549-6497 x708, or by email at [ripperger@picaassoc.net](mailto:ripperger@picaassoc.net). Body Work (Acupressure) Acupressure is a method of encouraging the body to promote natural healing and to improve functioning. This is traditionally done by inserting needles and applying heat or electrical stimulation at very precise acupuncture points. Acupressure, in comparison, uses the application of pressure on these points on the body rather than using needles. The classical Chinese explanation is that channels of energy run in regular patterns through the body and over its surface. These energy channels, called meridians, are like rivers flowing through the body to irrigate and nourish the tissues. An obstruction in the movement of these energy rivers is like a dam that backs up in others. The meridians can be influenced by the acupuncture points\u2014applying pressure to these points can help to unblock the obstructions at the dams, and reestablish the regular flow through the meridians. Acupressure treatments can therefore help the body's internal organs to correct imbalances in their digestion, absorption, and energy production activities, and in the circulation of their energy through the meridians. The modern scientific explanation is that applying pressure to the acupuncture points stimulates the nervous system to release chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord, and brain. These chemicals will either change the experience of pain, or they will trigger the release of other chemicals and hormones which influence the body's own internal regulating system. The improved energy and biochemical balance produced by acupressure results in stimulating the body's natural healing abilities, and in promoting physical and emotional well-being.

During this session, the body is completely wrapped in a sheet and wool blanket to aid in the relaxation process. How Does Hydrotherapy Work? Naturopaths use hydrotherapy to stimulate the vital force of the body thereby stimulating the speed of the healing process of many acute and chronic illnesses The healing properties of hydrotherapy are based on its mechanical and/or thermal effects. It makes use of the body's reaction to hot and cold stimuli. It can include hot water and cold water, each of which has a different effect on the body. to the protracted application of heat, to the pressure exerted by the water, and to the sensation of the water itself. Nerves carry what is felt by the skin deeper into the body, where it is then vital in stimulating the immune system, influencing the production of stress hormones, improving circulation and digestion, encouraging the flow of blood, and lessening the body's sensitivity to pain. Hot water is used to quiet and soothe the body, and to slow down the activity of internal organs. Cold is used to stimulate and invigorate, increasing internal activity within the body. If you are experiencing tense muscles or anxiety, heat is recommended in the shower or bath. For feeling tired and stressed out, it is recommended to take a warm shower or bath followed by a short cold shower to help stimulate the body and mind. Hydrotherapy Benefits Hydrotherapy is used to help in improving many conditions including: Acne Arthritis Colds Depression Headaches Stomach problems Joint, muscle, and nerve problems Sleep disorders Stress It is also commonly used for relaxation and to maintain a person's state of health.

By breaking through these energetic blocks, the body's inherent ability to heal itself is stimulated. At Pica & Associates Holistic Medicine, the Energy Healing session maybe facilitated by vibrational sounds from beautiful singing crystal bowls or tuning forks. How Does Energy Healing Work? A chakra (pronounced \"cha\"-\"kra\" with a resounding \"ch\") is a center of energy. Originating from Sanskrit, it literally means \"wheel\" by association with its function as a vortex of spinning energy interacting with various physiological and neurological systems in the body. Chakras are energy centers within the human body that help to regulate all its processes, from organ function to the immune system and emotions. We can commonly count 7 chakras positioned throughout your body, from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. Each chakra has its own vibrational frequency, that is depicted through a specific chakra color, and governs specific functions that help you function as a human. When singing bowls and tuning forks are played and particular sound frequencies are projected in the area, correct harmonic patterns can be restored. Scientific studies show that sound can produce changes in autonomic, immune, endocrine, and neuropeptide systems. Disharmony within the body can be helped to be restructured by sound. The sound from the singing bowls and tuning forks are calming and bring a sense of peacefulness\u2014 it is a relaxation that goes beyond the physical body. The tones of each chakra bowl will permeate the patient's system\u2014resonating their essence\u2014so that inner chaos, conflict, and dissonance seem almost immediately transformed into harmony. Energy Healing Benefits Any time is a good time to visit an energy healer. If you are stressed, anxious, or physically drained, an energy healing session can help you relax and feel more balanced. And if you're already feeling good, it's always possible to feel a little better! It's important to note that energy healing is a complementary modality that shouldn't exclude any Western medicine you may be taking.
