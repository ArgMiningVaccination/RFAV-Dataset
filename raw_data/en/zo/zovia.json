However, Federal law generally does not prohibit the mother's or newborn's attending Provider, after consulting with the mother, from discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applicable). In any case, plans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the Plan or the insurance issuer for prescri bing a length of stay not in excess of 48 hours (or 96 hours). Statement of Rights under the Women's Cancer Rights Act of 1998 If you have had or are going to have a mastectomy, you may be entitled to certain benefits under the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA). For individuals receiving mastectomy -related benefits, coverage will be provided in a manner determined in consultation with the attending Physician and the patient, for: All stages of reconstruction of the breast on whi ch the mastectomy was performed; Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance; Prostheses; and Treatment of physical complications of the mastectomy, including lymphedema.

Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act provides for parity in the application of aggregate treatment limitations (day or visit li mits) on mental health and substance abuse benefits with day or visit limits on medical and surgical benefits. In general, group health plans offering mental health and substance abuse benefits cannot set day/visit limits on mental health or substance abus e benefits that are lower than any such day or visit limits for medical and surgical benefits. A plan that does not impose day or visit limits on medical and surgical benefits may not impose such day or visit limits on mental 3 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 health and substance abuse ben efits offered under the Plan.

Medical Necessity criteria are available upon request. Special Enrollment Notice If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your Dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance coverage, you may in the future be able to enroll yourself or your Dependents in this Plan if you or your Dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops contributing towards your or your Dependents' other coverage). However, you must request enrollment within 31 days after your or your Dependents' other coverage ends (or after the employer stops contributin g toward the other coverage). In addition, if you have a new Dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you may be able to enroll yourself and Your Dependents. However, you must request enrollment within 31 days after t he marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, or as noted in \"Eligibility and Enrollment - Adding Members\".

State ment of ERISA Rights Please note: This section applies to employer sponsored plans other than Church employer groups and government groups. If you have questions about whether this Plan is governed by ERISA, please contact the Plan Administrator (the Group ). The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) entitles you, as a Member of the Group under this Contract, to: Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations such as worksites and union halls, all plan documents, including insurance contracts, collective bargaining agreements and copies of all documents filed by this plan with the U.S. Department of Labor, such as detailed annual reports and plan descriptions; Obtain copies of all plan document s and other plan information upon written request to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for these copies; and Receive a summary of the plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary financial report. In addition to creating rights for you and other employees, ERISA imposes duties on the people responsible for the operation of your employee benefit plan. The people who operate your pla n are called plan fiduciaries. They must handle your plan prudently and in the best interest of you and other plan 4 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate agai nst you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your right under ERISA. If your claim for welfare benefits is denied, in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial. You have the ri ght to have your claims reviewed and reconsidered. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request materials from the Plan Administrator and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a fed eral court. In such case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide you the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials are not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administra tor. If your claim for benefits is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. If plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance fro m the U.S. Department of Labor, or may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. It may order you to pay these expenses, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. If you have any questions about your plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

Also listed are any Benefit Period Maximums or limits that apply. Please read the \"What's Covered\" and Prescription Drugs section(s) for more details on the Plan's Covered Services. Read the \"What's Not Covered\" section for details on Excluded Se rvices. All Covered Services are subject to the conditions, Exclusions, limitations, and terms of this Booklet including any endorsements, amendments, or riders. To get the maximum benefits at the lowest out -of-pocket cost, you must get Covered Services from an In -Network Provider . Benefits for Covered Services are based on the Maximum Allowed Amount, which is the most the Plan will allow for a Covered Service. Except for Surprise Billing Claims, when you use an Out-of-Network Provider you may have to pay the difference between the Out -of-Network Provider's billed charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount in addition to any Coinsurance, Copayments, Deductibles, and non-covered charges. This amount can be substantial. Please read the \"Claims Payment\" section fo r more details. Deductibles, Coinsurance, and Benefit Period Maximums are calculated based upon the Maximum Allowed Amount, not the Provider's billed charges. 14 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Anthem Large Group Market Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Schedule of Benefits This is a brief \"Schedule of Benefits\" which generally describes the Plan's benefits for Covered Services, and the cost -share(s) you must pay, and where services are usually received.

This Plan has In -Network and Out -of-Network benefits. If you choose an In - Network Provider, you will pay less in out -of-pocket costs, such as Copayments, Deductibles, and Coinsurance. If you use an Out -of-Network Provider, you will have to pay more out -of-pock et costs. Where You Can Get Services Your Plan has different levels of coverage depending on the Providers you use. Site-of-Service In-Network Providers . When you go to a Site-of-Service In-Network Provider, you pay a lower Cost -Share on certain Covered Services than when you go to other In -Network Providers. Site-of- Service (SOS) providers include labs, radiology and diagnostic imaging centers. In-Network Providers . When you go to an In -Network Provider, you will pay the applicable Cost -Shares for Covered Services as outlined on Your \"Schedule of Benefits\". In -Network Providers include Primary Care Physicians / Providers (PCPs), Specialists (Specialty Care Physicians / Providers - SCPs), other professional Providers, Hospitals, and other Facilities who contract with us to care for you . Out-of-Network Providers . When you go to an Out -of-Network Provider, you will pay the highest Cost - Shares because these Providers are not in our network. In-Network Services When you use an In -Network Provider or get care as part of an Authorized Service, Covered Services will be covered at the In -Network level. Regardless of Medical Necessity, benefits will be denied for care that is not a Covered Service . We have complete authority to decide the Medical Necessity of the service. If you disagree with our determination, you have the right to file a Grievance as outlined in the \"Grievance Review Procedures\" section of this Booklet. Selecting a Primary Care Physician / Provider (PCP) It is recommend that you select a Primary Care Physician / Provider (PCP) from our network. PCPs include internists, family/general practitioners, pediatricians, geriatricians, and Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN). Each Member should choose a PCP who is listed in the Provider directory. Each Member of a family may select a different Primary Care Physician. For example, an internist or general practitioner may be chosen for adults and a pediatrician may be selected for children. If you want to chang e your PCP, call us or see our website, www.anthem.com . The Primary Care Physician is the Doctor who normally gives, directs, and manages your health care. First - Make an Appointment with Your PCP Your PCP's job is to help you stay healthy, not just treat you when you are sick. After you pick a PCP set up an office visit. During this visit, get to know your PCP and help your PCP get to know you. You should talk to your PCP about: 25 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Your personal health history, Your family health history, Your lifestyle, Any health concerns you have.

How to Find a Provider in the Network There are several ways you can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the network for this Plan. You can also find out where they are located and details about their license or training. See your Plan's directory of In -Network Providers at www.ant hem.com , which lists the Doctors, Providers, and Facilities that participate in this Plan's network. This directory is an interactive tool that helps you locate Providers based on Provider type, specialty, and location. It will also identify if is a Site -of-Service Provider. This information will appear under the \"recognitions(/Tier)\" link by the Physician or Facility name. You can use the \"Recognitions\" filter function to only select Site -of-Service Providers. Search for a Provider in our mobile app.27 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Contact Member Services to ask for a list of Doctors and Providers that participate in this Plan's network, based on specialty and geographic area. Check with your Doctor or Provider. In most cases, there will be a Provider in our Network to treat your specific illness or injury. If there is no In-Network Provider who is qualified to perform the treatment You require, contact Us prior to receiving the service or treatment, and We may approve an Out -of-Network Provide r for that service as an Authorized Service. We are required to confirm the list of In -Network Providers in our Provider Directory every 90 days. If you can show that you received inaccurate information from us that a Provider was In -Network on the date o f a particular claim, then you will only be liable for In -Network cost -shares (i.e., Deductible, Copayments and/or Coinsurance) for that claim. Your In -Network cost -shares will be calculated based upon the Maximum Allowed Amount. If you need details about a Provider's license or training, or help choosing a Doctor who is right for you, call the Member Services number on the back of your Member Identification Card. TTY/TDD services also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get in touch with us to help with your needs. Enhanced Personal Health Care Program Certain Primary Care Providers are part of our Enhanced Personal Health Care Program, a program aimed at improving the quality of our Members' health care. Providers in this p rogram agree to coordinate much of your care and will prepare care plans for Members who have multiple, complex health conditions. Providers in this program have met certain quality requirements, including standards from the National Committee on Quality Assurance, the American Diabetes Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and others. We encourage you to use these Providers whenever possible. Your Cost -Shares Your Plan may involve Copayments, Deductibles, and/or Coinsurance, which are charges that you must pay when receiving Covered Services. Your Plan may also have an Out -of-Pocket Limit, which limits the cost-shares you must pay. Please read the \"Schedule of Benefits\" for details on your cost -shares. Also read the \"Definitions\" section for a better understanding of each type of cost -share. The BlueCard Program Like all Blue Cross & Blue Shield plans throughout the country, we participate in a program called \"BlueCard\", which provides services to you when you are outside our Service Area. For more details on this program, please see \"Inter -Plan Arrangements\" in the \"Claims Payment\" section. Identification Card (ID Card) We will give an Identification Card (ID Card) to each Member enrolled in the Plan. When you get care, you must show your Identification Card. Only a Member who has paid the Fees for this Plan has the right 28 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 to services or benefits under this Booklet. If any one gets services or benefits to which they are not entitled to under the terms of this Booklet, he/she must pay for the actual cost of the services. 29 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Getting Approval for Benefits Your Plan includes the process of Utilization Review to decide wh en services are Medically Necessary or Experimental/Investigational as those terms are defined in this Booklet. Utilization Review aids the delivery of cost -effective health care by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of care and/or the setting or place of service that they are performed. If you have any questions about the Utilization Review process, the medical policies, or clinical guidelines, you may call the Member Services phone number on the back of your Identification Card. Coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed is not guaranteed even if it is determined that your services are Medically Necessary. For benefits to be covered, on the date you get service: You must be eligible for benefits; Fees must be paid for the time period that services are given; The service or supply must be a Covered Service under your Plan; The service cannot be subject to an Exclusion under your Plan; and You must not have exceeded any applicable limits under your Plan. Types of Reviews Pre-service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination, which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date. Precertification - A required Pre -service Review for a benefit coverag e determination for a service or treatment. Certain services require Precertification in order for you to get benefits. The benefit coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical Necessity or is Experime ntal / Investigational as those terms are defined in this Booklet. For admissions following Emergency Care, you, your authorized representative or Doctor must tell us within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. For childbirth admissions, Precertification is not needed unless there is a problem and/or the mother and baby are not sent home at the same time. Precertification is not required for the first 48 hours for a vaginal delivery or 96 hours for a cesarean section. Admissions longer than 48/96 hours require precertificatio n. Continued Stay / Concurrent Review - A Utilization Review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination which must be done during an ongoing stay in a facility or course of treatment. Both Pre -Service and Continued Stay / C oncurrent Reviews may be considered urgent when, in the view of the treating Provider or any Doctor with knowledge of your medical condition, without such care or treatment, your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function could be seriously threatened or you could be subjected to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without such care or treatment. Urgent reviews are conducted under a shorter timeframe than standard reviews. Post -service Review - A review of a service, treatment or a dmission for a benefit coverage that is conducted after the service has been provided. Post -service reviews are performed when a service, treatment or admission did not need a Precertification, or when a needed Precertification was not30 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5J92 $10/$20/$20 obtained. Post -servi ce reviews are done for a service, treatment or admission in which we have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us. Reviewing Where Services Are Provided A service must be Medically Necessary to be a Covered Service. When l evel of care, setting or place of service is reviewed, services that can be safely given to you in a lower level of care or lower cost setting / place of care, will not be Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care, or higher cost setting / place of care. This means that a request for a service may be denied because it is not Medically Necessary for the service to be provided where it is being requested. When this happens the service can be requested again in another place and will be r eviewed again for Medical Necessity. At times a different Provider or Facility may need to be used in order for the service to be considered Medically Necessary. Examples include, but are not limited to: A service may be denied on an inpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable if provided on an outpatient basis at a Hospital. A service may be denied on an outpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable at a free standing imaging center, infusion center, Ambulatory Surgery Center (Su rgical Center), or in a Physician's office. A service may be denied at a Skilled Nursing Facility but may be approvable in a home setting. Utilization Review criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines. Anthem m ay decide that a treatment that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if a clinically equivalent treatment that is more cost effective is available and appropriate. \"Clinically equivalent\" means treatments that for most Members, will give you similar re sults for a disease or condition. Who is Responsible for Precertification? Typically, In -Network Providers know which services need Precertification and will get any Precertification when needed. Your Primary Care Physician and other In -Network Providers have been given detailed information about these procedures and are responsible for meeting these requirements. Generally, the ordering Provider, Facility or attending Doctor (\"requesting Provider\") will get in touch with us to ask for a Precertification. However, you may request a Precertification or you may choose an authorized representative to act on your behalf for a specific request. The authorized representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or older. The table below outlines who is responsibl e for Precertification and under what circumstances. Provider Network Status Responsibility to Get Precertification Comments In-Network Provider The Provider must get Precertification when required Out-of-Network / Non - Participating Member Member must get Precertification when required. (Call Member Services.) Member may be financially responsible for charges/costs related to the service and/or setting in whole or in part if the service and/or setting is found to not be Medically Necessary.31 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Provider Network Status Responsibility to Get Precertification Comments BlueCard Provider Member (Except for Inpatient Admissions) Member must get Precertification when required. (Call Member Services.) Member may be financially responsible for charges/costs related to the service and/or setting in whole or in part if the serv ice and/or setting is found to not be Medically Necessary. BlueCard Providers must obtain precertification for all Inpatient Admissions. NOTE: For an Emergency Care admission, precertification is not required. However, you, your authorized representative or Doctor must tell us within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. How Decisions are Made We use our clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy, clinical guidelines, and other appli cable policies and procedures to help make our Medical Necessity decisions. This includes decisions about Prescription Drugs as detailed in the section \"Prescription Drugs Administered by a Medical Provider\". Medical policies and clinical guidelines reflec t the standards of practice and medical interventions identified as proper medical practice. As Claims Administrator, we reserve the right, on behalf of the Group, to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines from time to time. You are entitled to ask for and get, free of charge, reasonable access to any records concerning your request. To ask for this information, call the Precertification phone number on the back of your Identification Card. If you are not satisfied with the decision under this section of your benefits, please refer to the \"Grievance Review Procedures\" section to see what rights may be available to you. Decision and Notice Requirements We will review requests for benefits according to the timeframes listed below. The timeframes and requirements listed are based on federal laws. If you live in and/or get services in a state other than the state where your Contract was issued other state -specific requirements may apply. You may call the phone number on the back of your I dentification Card for more details.

If we do not get the specific information we need by the required timeframe, we will make a decision based upon the information we have. We will notify you and your Provider of our decision as required by state and federal law. Notice may be given by one or more of the following methods: verbal, written, and/or electronic. Important Information On behalf of the Group, Anthem may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain medical management processes (including utilization management, case management, and disease management) and/or offer an alternate benefit if in our discretion, such change furthers the provision of cost effective, val ue based and/or quality services. We may also select certain qualifying Providers to take part in a program or a Provider arrangement that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would otherwise apply. We may also exempt your claim from medical review if certain conditions apply. Just because Anthem exempts a process, Provider or Claim from the standards which otherwise would apply, it does not mean that Anthem will do so in the future, or will do so in the future for any other 33 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Provider, claim or Member. Anthem may stop or change any such exemption with or without advance notice. You may find out whether a Provider is taking part in certain programs or a Provider arrangement by contacting the Member Services number on the back of your ID card. We also may identify certain Providers to review for potential fraud, waste, abuse or other inappropriate activity if the claims data suggests there may be inappropriate billing practices. If a Provider is selected under this progra m, then we may use one or more clinical utilization management guidelines in the review of claims submitted by this Provider, even if those guidelines are not used for all Providers delivering services to this Plan's Members . Health Plan Individual Case M anagement We have a range of programs designed to provide and/or help coordinate services for Members with health care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions (the \"Program(s)\") . Our Programs provide certain services, coordinate benefits and/or educate Members who agree to take part in them to he lp meet their health -related needs. Our Programs are confidential and voluntary and are made available at no extra cost to you. These programs are provided by, or on behalf of and at the request of Anthem and are separate from any Covered Services you are receiving. If you meet Program criteria and agree to take part, we will help you meet your identified health care needs. This is reached through contact and teamwork with you and, as appropriate, your chosen authorized representative, treating Doctor(s), and other Providers. In addition, we may assist in coordinating care with existing community -based programs and services to meet your needs. This may include giving you information about external agencies and community -based programs and services. In ce rtain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, the Plan may provide benefits for alternate care that is not listed as a Covered Service. The Plan may also extend Covered Services beyond the Benefit Maximums of this Plan.

Important Details About Prescription Drug Coverage Your Plan includes certain features to determine when Prescription Drugs should be covered, which are described below. As part of these features, y our prescribing Doctor may be asked to give more details before we can decide if the Prescription Drug is eligible for coverage. In order to determine if the Prescription Drug is eligible for coverage, we have established criteria. The criteria, which are called drug edits, may include requirements regarding one o r more of the following: Quantity, dose, and frequency of administration, Specific clinical criteria including, but not limited to, requirements regarding age, test result requirements, and/or presence of a specific condition or disease, Specific Provider qualifications including, but not limited to, REMS certification (Risk, Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies), Use of an Anthem Prescription Drug List (a formulary developed by Anthem) which is a list of FDA - approved Drugs that have been reviewed and recom mended for use based on their quality and cost effectiveness. Some or all of these drug edits may apply to your plan, please call \"Member Services\" if you have any questions. Covered Prescription Drugs To be a Covered Service, Prescription Drugs must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, under federal law, require a Prescription. Prescription Drugs must be prescribed by a licensed Provider and Controlled Substances must be prescribed by a licensed Provider with an active DEA licens e. Compound drugs are a Covered Service when a commercially available dosage form of a Medically Necessary medication is not available, all the ingredients of the compound drug are FDA approved, require a prescription to dispense, and are not essentially the same as an FDA -approved product from a drug manufacturer. Non -FDA approved, non -proprietary, multisource ingredients that are vehicles essential for compound administration may be covered. 65 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Precertification Precertification may be required for certain Prescription Drugs to help make sure proper use and guidelines for Prescription Drug coverage are followed. We will give the results of our decision to both you and your Provider. For a list of Prescription Drugs that need Precertification , please call th e phone number on the back of your Identification Card. The list will be reviewed and updated from time to time. Including a Prescription Drug or related item on the list does not guarantee coverage under your Plan. Your Provider may check with us to verif y Prescription Drug coverage, to find out which Drugs are covered under this section and if any drug edits apply. Please refer to the section \"Getting Approval for Benefits\" for more details. If precertification is denied you have the right to file a Grievance as outlined in the \"Grievance Review Procedures\" section of this Booklet. Designated Pharmacy Provider Anthem in its sole discretion, may establish one or more Designated Pharmacy Provider programs which provide specific pharmacy services (inclu ding shipment of Prescription Drugs) to Members. An In -Network Provider is not necessarily a Designated Pharmacy Provider. To be a Designated Pharmacy Provider, the In-Network Provider must have signed a Designated Pharmacy Provider Agreement with us. You or your Provider can contact Member Services to learn which Pharmacy or Pharmacies are part of a Designated Pharmacy Provider program. For Prescription Drugs that are shipped to you or your Provider and administered in your Provider's office, you and your Provider are required to order from a Designated Pharmacy Provider. A Patient Care coordinator will work with you and your Provider to obtain Precertification and to assist shipment to your Provider's office. We may also require you to use a Designated P harmacy Provider to obtain Prescription Drugs for treatment of certain clinical conditions such as Hemophilia. We reserve our right to modify the list of Prescription Drugs as well as the setting and/or level of care in which the care is provided to you. A nthem may, from time to time, change with or without advance notice, the Designated Pharmacy Provider for a Drug, if in our discretion, such change can help provide cost effective, value based and/or quality services. If You are required to use a Designat ed Pharmacy Provider and you choose not to obtain your Prescription Drug from a Designated Pharmacy Provider, coverage will be provided at the Out -of-Network level.

When you receive care from an In -Network Provider, you do not need to file a claim because the In-Network Provider will do this for you. If you receive care from an Out -of-Network Provider, you will need to make sure a claim is filed. Many Out -of-Network Hospitals, Doctors and other Providers will file your claim for you, although they are not required to do so. If you file the claim, use a claim form as described later in this section. Maximum Allowed Amount (MAA) General This section describes how we determine the amount of reimbursement for Covered Services. Reimbursement for services rendered by In -Network and Out -of-Network Provid ers is based on this Booklet's Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that you receive. Please see \"Inter -Plan Arrangements\" later in this section for additional information. The Maximum Allowed Amount for this Booklet is the maximum amount of rei mbursement allowed for services and supplies: That meet the definition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered under your Booklet and are not excluded; That are Medically Necessary; and That are provided in accordance wit h all applicable preauthorization, utilization management or other requirements set forth in your Booklet. You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsuranc e. Except for Surprise Billing Claims, when you receive Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider, you may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider's actual charges. This amount can be significant. When you receive Covered Services from a Provider, we will, to the extent applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accura cy and appropriateness of the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect our determination of the Maximum Allowed Amount. Our application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services you received were not Medically Necessary. It means we have determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a sin gle procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Doctor or other healthcare professional, the Plan may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts for those secondary and subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for tho se procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. 83 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Provider Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is an In -Network Prov ider or an Out -of-Network Provider. An In -Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specific product or in a special Center of Excellence/or other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with us. For Covered Services performed by an In -Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this Booklet is the rate the Provider has agreed with us to accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because In -Network Providers have agreed to accept th e Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send you a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum Allowed Amount. However, you may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amou nt to the extent you have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. Please call Member Services for help in finding an In -Network Provider or visit www.anthem.com . Providers who have not signed any contract with us and are not in any of our networks are Out -of- Network Providers, subject to Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules governing claims filed by certain ancillary providers. Except for Surprise Billing Claims, we will calculate the Maximum Allowed Amount for Covered Services You receive from an Out -of-Network Provider, using one of the following as determined by us, on behalf of the Group: 1.An amount based on our Out -of-Network Provider fee schedule/rate , which we have established in our discretion, and which we reserve the right to modify from time to time, after considering one or more of the following: reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar providers contracted with us, reimbursement amounts pa id by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies, and other industry cost, reimbursement and utilization data; or 2.An amount based on reimbursement or cost information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service s (\"CMS\"). When basing the Maximum Allowed amount upon the level or method of reimbursement used by CMS, Anthem will update such information, which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less than annually; or 3.An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect one or more of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment; or (3) comparable Providers' fees and costs to deliver care, or 4.An am ount negotiated by us or a third party vendor, which has been agreed to by the Provider. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management, or 5.An amount based on or derived from the total charges billed by the Out -of-Network Provider . For Emergency services You receive from an Out -of-Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be the greatest of the following amounts: 1.The amount the insured's health care plan would pay for such services if rendered by an In -Network health care provider; 2.The usual, customary and reasonable rate for such services, (\"Usual, customary and reasonable rate\" means the eightieth percentile of all charges for the particular health care service performed by a health care provider in the same or similar specialty and provided in the same geographical area, as reported by FAIR Health, Inc) or 3.The amount Medicare would reimburse for such services.84 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Providers who are not contracted for this Plan, but are contracted for other products with us are also consid ered Out -of-Network. For this Booklet, the Maximum Allowed Amount for services from these Providers will be one of the five methods shown above unless the contract between us and that Provider specifies a different amount or if your claim involves a Surpri se Billing Claim. For Covered Services rendered outside Anthem's Service Area by Out -of-Network Providers, claims may be priced using the local Blue Cross Blue Shield plan's non -participating provider fee schedule / rate or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In certain situations, the Maximum Allowed Amount for out of area claims may be based on billed charges, the pricing we would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Anthem Service Area, or a special negotiated price. Unlike In -Network Providers, Out -of-Network Providers may send you a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider's charge that exceeds our Maximum Allowed Amount unless your claim involves a Surpris e Billing Claim. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount can be significant. Choosing an In -Network Provider will likely result in lower out -of-pocket costs to you. P lease call Member Services for help in finding an In - Network Provider or visit our website at www.anthem.com . Member Services is also available to assist you in determining this Booklet's Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from an Out -of-Network Provider. In order for us to assist you, you will need to obtain from your Provider the specific procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will ren der. You will also need to know the Provider's charges to calculate your Out -of-Pocket responsibility. Although Member Services can assist you with this pre -service information, the final Maximum Allowed Amount for your claim will be based on the actual cl aim submitted by the Provider. For Prescription Drugs, the Maximum Allowed Amount is the amount determined by us using Prescription Drug cost information provided by the Pharmacy Benefits Manager. Member Cost -Share For certain Covered Services and depend ing on your Plan design, you may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as your cost -share amount (for example, Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance). Your cost -share amount and Out -of-Pocket Limits may vary depending on whether you received services from an In -Network or Out -of-Network Provider. Specifically, you may be required to pay higher cost - sharing amounts or may have limits on your benefits when using Out -of-Network Providers. Please see the \"Schedule of Benefits\" in this Boo klet for your cost -share responsibilities and limitations, or call Member Services to learn how this Booklet's benefits or cost -share amounts may vary by the type of Provider you use. The Plan will not provide any reimbursement for non -Covered Services. Y ou may be responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non -Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are performed by an In -Network or Out -of-Network Provider. Non -covered services include services specifically excluded from cov erage by the terms of your Plan and received after benefits have been exhausted Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, benefit caps or day/visit limits. In some instances you may only be asked to pay the lower In -Network cost -sharing amount when you use an Out -of-Network Provider. For example, if you go to an In -Network Hospital or Provider Facility and unknowingly receive Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who is employed b y or contracted with an In -Network Hospital or Facility, you will pay the In -Network cost -share amounts for those Covered Services. However, you also may be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of-Network Provider's charge. 85 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 We and/or our designated pharmacy benefits manager may receive discounts, rebates, or other funds from drug manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and/or similar vendors, which may be related to certain Prescription Drug purchases under this Benefi t Booklet and which positively impact the cost effectiveness of Covered Services. These amounts are retained by us. These amounts will not be applied to your Deductible, if any, or taken into account in determining your Copayment or Coinsurance. The fol lowing are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Booklet's cost -share amounts; see your \"Schedule of Benefits\" for your applicable amounts. Example: Your Plan has a Coinsurance cost -share of 20% for In -Netwo rk services, and 30% for Out -of- Network services after the In -Network or Out -of-Network Deductible has been met. You choose an In -Network surgeon. The charge was $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility w hen an In -Network surgeon is used is 20% of $1500, or $300. We allow 80% of $1500, or $1200. The In -Network surgeon accepts the total of $1500 as reimbursement for the surgery regardless of the charges. Your total out -of-pocket responsibility would be $300 . You choose an Out -of-Network surgeon. The Out -of-Network surgeon's charge for the service is $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery service is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility for the Out -of-Network surgeon is 30% of $1500, or $450 after t he Out -of-Network Deductible has been met. We allow the remaining 70% of $1500, or $1050. In addition , the Out -of- Network surgeon could bill you the difference between $2500 and $1500, so your total Out -of-Pocket charge would be $450 plus an additional $10 00, for a total of $1450 . Authorized Services In some circumstances, such as where there is no In -Network Provider available for the Covered Service, we may authorize the In -Network Cost -Share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service You receive from an Out -of-Network Provider. In such circumstances, you must contact us in advance of obtaining the Covered Service. We also may authorize the In -Network cost -share amounts to apply to a claim for Covered Services if you receive Emergency Care services from an Out -of-Network Provider and are not able to contact us until after the Covered Service is rendered. If we authorize an In -Network cost -share amount to apply to a Covered Service received from an Out -of-Network Provider, You may also still be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of-Network Provider's charge unless your claims involves a Surprise Billing Claim. Please contact Member Services for ad ditional Authorized Services information or to request authorization. Surprise Bill ing Claims (Surprise Bill) Federal law protections against balance billing apply to care received in emergency settings and in in - network facilities from out -of-network pro viders. The law requires private health plans to cover surprise medical bills for emergency services, including air ambulance services (but not ground ambulance services), as well as Out -of-Network provider bills for services rendered at In -Network hospita ls and facilities. Patients are responsible for cost -sharing no greater than what they pay for In -Network care, and their cost-sharing applies to their In -Network Deductible and Out -of-Pocket limit. Providers and facilities are barred from sending patient s a bill for amounts other than cost sharing that exceed the amount paid by the health plan or insurer. 86 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 A Surprise bill does not include a bill for Covered Services received by a Member when an In -Network Provider was available to render such services and the Member knowingly elected to obtain such services from another Provider who was Out -of-Network. In certain situations, an Out -of-Network Provider must provide you with notice of their status as Out -of- Network. Should you agree in advance to accept ser vices from an Out -of-Network Provider, you will be responsible for the Out -of-Network Cost -shares and any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of-Network Provider's billed charges. If you feel you have had a service that is covered un der the Surprise Billing Claims protections, you have the right to appeal those claims. Please see the \"Grievance Review Process\" section for more information. Federal/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharg e, tax or other fee. If applicable, we will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you. Claims Review Anthem has processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud, waste, abuse and other inappropriate activity. Members seeking services from Out -of-Network Providers could be balance billed by the Out -of-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not payable as a result of these review processes. A claim may also be determine d to be not payable due to a Provider's failure to submit medical records with the claims that are under review in these processes. Notice of Claim & Proof of Loss As Claims Administrator, we must receive written notice of your claim after you receive Covered Services in order for benefits to be paid. In-Network Providers will submit claims for you. They are responsible for ensuring that claims have the information we need to determine benefits. If the claim does not include enough information, we will ask them for more details, and they will be required to supply those details within certain timeframes. Out-of-Network claims can be submitted by the Provider if the Provider is willing to file on your behalf. However, if the Provider is not subm itting on your behalf , you will be required to submit the claim. Claim forms are usually available from the Provider. If they do not have a claims form, you can send a written request to us, or contact Member Services and ask for a claims form to be sent t o you. We will send the form to you within 15 days. If you do not receive the claims form within 15 days, you can still submit written notice of the claim without the claim form. The same information that would be given on the claim form must be included i n the written notice of claim, including: Name of patient. Patient's relationship with the Subscriber. Identification number. Date, type, and place of service. Your signature and the Provider's signature.87 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM $10/$20/$20 Out-of-Network claims must be submitted within 90 -days. In certain cases, state or federal law may allow additional time to file a claim, if you could not reasonably file within the 90 -day period. The claim must have the information we need to determine benefits. If the claim does not include enough inf ormation, we will ask you for more details and inform you of the time by which we need to receive that information. Once we receive the required information, we will process the claim according to the terms of your Plan. Please note that failure to submit the information we need by the time listed in our request could result in the denial of your claim, unless state or federal law requires an extension. Please contact Member Services if you have any questions or concerns about how to submit claims. Upon r eceiving a claim, we will process it within 60 -days for paper claims and 20 -days for electronic claims. If the claim does not include enough information, we will send a request to you or your Provider for addition information within 30 -days for paper claim s and 10 -days for electronic claims. Once we receive the required information, the claim will be processed according to the terms of your Plan within 30-days for paper claims and 10 - days for electronic claims. We have, as the Claims Administrator, the ri ght to enforce the Group's rights under this provision. Member's Cooperation You will be expected to complete and submit to us all such authorizations, consents, releases, assignments and other documents that may be needed in order to obtain or assure reimbursement under Medicare, Workers' Compensation or any other governmental program. If you fail to cooperate, you will be responsible for any charge for services. Payment of Benefits You authorize us , on behalf of the Group, to make payments directly to Providers for Covered Services. In no event, however, shall payments made directly to a Provider be deemed to suggest that any Provider is a beneficiary with independent claims and appeal rights under the Plan. We reserve the right, on behalf of the Group, to make payments directly to you as opposed to any Provider for Covered Service, at the Plan's discretion. Notwithstanding any limitations or restrictions on assignment of benefits contained in this certificate, Anthem will n ot deny or refuse to honor any assignment of benefits for Covered Services made to a dentist or oral surgeon subject to compliance with the requirements of applicable Connecticut insurance law governing assignment of benefits. In the event that payment is made directly to you, you have the responsibility to apply this payment to the claim from the Out -of-Network Provider. Payments and notice regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of claims may also be sent to an Alternate Recipient (which is defined her ein as any child of a Subscriber who is recognized under a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" as having a right to enrollment under the Group's Plan), or that person's custodial parent or designated representative. Any payments made by us (whether to any Provider for Covered Service or You) will discharge the Plan's obligation to pay for Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to receive payment to anyone, except as required by a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" as defined by, and if subj ect to, ERISA or any applicable Federal law. Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, the Plan will not honor a request to withhold payment of the claims submitted. 88 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 The coverage, rights, and benefits under the Plan are not assignable by any Member wit hout the written consent of the Plan, except as provided above. This prohibition against assignment includes rights to receive payment, claim benefits under the Plan and/or law, sue or otherwise begin legal action, or request Plan documents or any other in formation that a Participant or beneficiary may request under ERISA. Any assignment made without written consent from the Plan will be void and unenforceable. Inter -Plan Arrangements Out-of-Area Services Overview We have a variety of relationships with ot her Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees. Generally, these relationships are called \"Inter -Plan Arrangements\". These Inter -Plan Arrangements work based on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\"Association\"). Whenever yo u access healthcare services outside the geographic area we serve (the \"Anthem Service Area\"), the claim for those services may be processed through one of these Inter -Plan Arrangements. The Inter -Plan Arrangements are described below. When you receive ca re outside of the Anthem Service Area, you will receive it from one of two kinds of Providers. Most Providers (\"participating Providers\") contract with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in that geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). Some Providers (\"non participating Providers\") don't contract with the Host Blue. We explain below how both kinds of Providers are paid. Inter -Plan Arrangements Eligibility - Claim Types Most claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter-Plan Arrangements, as described above. Examples of claims that are not included are Prescription Drugs that you obtain from a Pharmacy and most dental or vision benefits. BlueCard\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when you receive Covered Services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, we will still fulfill our contractual obligations. But, the Host Blue is responsible for (a) contracting with its Providers, and (b) handling i ts interactions with those Providers. When you receive Covered Services outside the Anthem Service Area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay is calculated based on the lower of: The billed charges for Covered Servic es; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to us. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to the Provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into accou nt special arrangements with that Provider. Sometimes, such an arrangement may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for services provided by similar types of Providers. Estimated and average pricing arrangements may also involve types of settlements, incentive payments and/or other credits or charges. Estimated pricing and average pricing also take into account adjustments to correct for over - or underestimation of past pricing of claims, as noted above. However , such adjustments will not affect the price used for your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid. 89 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Negotiated (non -BlueCard Program) Arrangements With respect to one or more Host Blues, instead of using the BlueCard Program, Anthem may process your claims for Covered Services through Negotiated Arrangements for National Accounts. The amount you pay for Covered Services under this arrangement will be calculated based on the lower of either billed charges for Covered Services or the negotiated price (refer to the description of negotiated price under Section A. BlueCard Program) made available to Anthem by the Host Blue. Special Cases: Value -Based Programs BlueCard\u00ae Program If you receive Covered Services und er a Value -Based Program inside a Host Blue's Service Area, you will not be responsible for paying any of the Provider Incentives, risk -sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees that are a part of such an arrangement, except when a Host Blue passes these fees to Anthem through average pricing or fee schedule adjustments. Additional information is available upon request. Value -Based Programs: Negotiated (non -BlueCard Program) Arrangements If Anthem has entered into a Negotiated Arrangement with a Host Blue to provide Value -Based Programs to the Anthem on your behalf, Anthem will follow the same procedures for Value -Based Programs administration and Care Coordinator Fees as noted above for the BlueCard Program. Inter -Plan Programs: Federal/State Taxes/Surcha rges/Fees Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee. If applicable, we will, on behalf of the Group, include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you. Nonparticipating Providers Outside Our Service Area 1.Allowed Amounts and Member Liability Calculation When Covered Services are provided outside of Anthem's Service Area by non -participating providers, we may determine , on behalf of the Group, benefits a nd make payment based on pricing from either the Host Blue or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In these situations, the amount you pay for such services as Deductible, Copayment or Coinsurance will be based on that allo wed amount. Also, you may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the non -participating provider bills and the payment that was made for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. Federal or state law, as applicable, will govern payments for out-of-network Emergency services. 2.Exceptions In certain situations, we may use other pricing methods, such as billed charges or the pricing we would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Anthem Service Area, or a spec ial negotiated price to determine the amount we will pay , on behalf of the Group, for services provided by nonparticipating providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the nonparticipating provider bills and the payment made for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph.90 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core \u00ae If you plan to travel outside the United States, call Member Services to find out your Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae benefits .

Understanding Coordination of Benefits Applicability The Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies to this Plan when you have health coverage under more than one Plan. If you are covered by this Plan and another Plan, the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" in this section s hall determine which Plan is the primary Plan. The benefits of this Plan: Shall not be reduced when under the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" this Plan is the primary Plan; but May be reduced or the reasonable cash value of any Covered Service pr ovided under this Plan may be recovered from the primary Plan when under the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" another Plan is the primary Plan. The above reduction is described in the \"Effect Of This Plan On The Benefits Policy\" Subsection; Penaltie s imposed on you by the primary carrier are not subject to COB; You must submit the explanation of benefits from the primary Plan to Anthem within two years of the date of service in order to be eligible for payment under this Coordination of Benefits Sec tion. Allowable Expense A Medically Necessary item of expense for health care that is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the Member for whom the claim is made, including applicable Cost -Shares, is an Allowable Expense. When this Plan p rovides Covered Services, the reasonable cash value of each Covered Service is the Allowable Expense and is a benefit paid. Allowable Expense does not include coverage for: Services not provided for under this Plan. Any reduction in benefits or Penalties imposed by another Plan because you did not comply with the provisions of that Plan, are not reimbursable as a Covered Service under this Plan. The difference between the cost of a private Hospital room and the cost of a semi -private Hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private Hospital room is Medically Necessary. The amount that is subject to the Primary high -deductible health plan's deductible, if We have been advised by you that all Plans covering you are high -deductible health plans and you intend to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.92 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Some services may not coordinate as an Allowable Expense, this may include but is not limited to: Dental care, Vision care, or hearing aid programs. Claim Determination Period The Claim Determination Period is your Benefit Period. However, it does not include any part of a Benefit Period during which a person has no coverage under t his Plan, or any part of a Benefit Period before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. Plan For the purpose of this Section, a Plan means any of the following which provides benefits or services for, or because of, medical care or treatment: Group health insurance, group -type coverage, whether fully insured or self -insured, or any other contract or arrangement where a health benefit is provided. This includes prepayment, staff or group practice association health maintenance org anization coverage. Coverage under a governmental Plan or required or provided by law. This does not include a state Plan under Medicaid (Title XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, or the United States Social Security Act as amended from time to time). It also does not include any Plan when, by law, its benefits are in excess of those of any private insurance program or other non -governmental program. Medical benefits coverage of no -fault and traditional automobile fault contracts, as pr ovided in this Section. Each contract or other arrangement for coverage as described above is a separate Plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate Plan. Primary Plan A Primary Plan is a Plan whose benefits for a person's health care coverage must be determined without taking the existence of any other Plan into consideration. A Plan is a Primary Plan if either provision below is true: The Plan either has no Order of Benefit Determination rules or it has rules which differ from those stated in this Section; or All Plans which cover the person use the Order of Benefit Determination rules as stated in this Section and under those rules the Plan determines its benefits fi rst. There may be more than one Primary Plan (for example: two Plans which have no Order of Benefit Determination rules). When this Plan is the Primary Plan, Covered Services are provided or covered without considering the other Plan's benefits. Secondar y Plan A Secondary Plan is a Plan which is not a Primary Plan. If you are covered by more than one Secondary Plan, the Order of Benefit Determination rules of this Section decide the order in which your benefits are determined in relation to each other. Th e benefits of the Secondary Plan may take into consideration the 93 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 benefits of the Primary Plan or Plans and the benefits of any other Plan which, under the rules of this Section, has its benefits determined before those of the Secondary Plan. When this Pla n is the Secondary Plan, benefits for Covered Services under this Plan may be reduced and Anthem may recover from the Primary Plan, the Provider, or you, the reasonable cash value of the Covered Services provided by this Plan. Order of Benefit Determinati on Rules General Rule When you receive Covered Services by or through this Plan or is otherwise entitled to claim benefits under this Plan and has followed all Our guidelines and procedures, including Precertification requirements as specified in this Book let, and the Covered Services are a basis for a claim under another Plan, this Plan is a Secondary Plan which has its benefits determined after those of the other Plan, unless: The other Plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those described in the Booklet; and Both the other Plan's rules and this Plan's coordination rules, as described below, require that this Plan's benefits be determined before those of the other Plan. The Plan shall be secondary in coverage to any medical payments provision, no -fault automobile insurance policy, or personal injury protection policy regardless of any election made by anyone to the contrary. The Plan shall also be secondary to any excess insurance policy, including, but not limited to, school and/or athletic polic ies. This provision applies notwithstanding any coordination of benefits term to the contrary. Coordination Rules We determine the order of benefits, on behalf of the Group, using the following rules: Other than a Dependent The benefits of the Plan which covers the person as a Subscriber (that is, other than as a Dependent) are primary to those of the Plan which covers the person as a Dependent. Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced When this Plan and another Plan cover the same child as a Dependent of different persons, called \"parents\" the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year is primary to the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year, but if both parents have the same birthday, the Plan which cover ed a parent longer is primary. Only the month and day of the birthday are considered. Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced Parents When a claim is made for a Dependent child: When the parents are separated or divorced and the parent with legal custody o f the child has not remarried, the benefits of a Plan which covers the child as a Dependent of the parent with legal custody of the child shall be determined before the benefits of a Plan which covers the child as a Dependent of the parent without legal cu stody.94 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 When the parents are divorced and the parent with legal custody of the child has remarried, the benefits of a Plan which covers the child as a Dependent of the parent with custody shall be determined before the benefits of a Plan which covers that child as a Dependent of the stepparent. The benefit of a Plan which covers that child as a Dependent of the step -parent shall be determined before the benefits of a Plan which covers that child as a Dependent of the parent without legal custody. If the s pecific terms of a court order state that one of the parents is financially responsible for the health care expenses of the child, then the Plan which covers the child as a Dependent of the financially responsible parent shall be determined before the bene fits of any other Plan which covers the child as a Dependent child. The provisions of this Subsection do not apply with respect to any Claim Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the payer has that actual knowledge. Active/Inactive Employee A Plan which covers you as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or a Plan that covers you as a Dependent) is primary to a Plan which covers you as a laid -off or retired employee (or a Plan that covers you as a Dependent). If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage If none of the above rules determines the order of benefit s, the Plan which covered you longer is primary to the Plan which covered you for a shorter time. Medicare If you are eligible for Medicare and still covered under this Plan, We will provide the benefits of this Plan, except as required by law. However, t hese benefits will be reduced to an amount which, when added to the benefits received pursuant to Medicare, may equal, but not exceed the actual charges for services covered in whole or in part by either this Plan or Parts A, B and D of Medicare. (Note: C ertain services may not require Precertification when it is determined that We are the Secondary Plan. Contact Member Services before any services are rendered to determine if such services require Precertification. In the event that a later determination finds that We are the Primary Plan, any services that were obtained without Precertification while We were administering benefits as a Secondary Plan will not require Precertification as would be required under a Primary Plan.) Effect Of This Plan On The Benefits 1.This Subsection applies when, in accordance with the Order of Benefit Determination Rules, this Plan is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other Plans. In that event, the benefits of this Plan may be reduced under this Subsection. Such other P lan or Plans are referred to as \"the other Plans\". 2.Reduction in this Plan's benefits. When this Plan is the Secondary Plan, Anthem will provide benefits under this Plan so that the sum of the reasonable cash value of any Covered Service provided by this Plan and the benefits payable under the other Plans shall not total more than the Allowable Expense. Benefits will be provided by the Secondary Plan at the lesser of: the amount that would have been paid had it been the Primary Plan or the balance of the bi ll. We will never pay, on behalf of the Group, more than it would have paid as the Primary Plan.95 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 If another Plan provides that its benefits are \"excess\" or \"always secondary\" and if this Plan is determined to be secondary under this Plan's COB provisions, the amount of benefits payable under this Plan shall be determined on the basis of this Plan being secondary. If the non -complying Plan does not provide the information needed by this Plan to determine its benefits within a reasonable time after it is req uested to do so, this Plan shall assume that the benefits of the non -complying Plan are identical to its own, and shall pay its benefits accordingly. However, this Plan must adjust any payments it makes based on such assumption whenever information becomes available as to the actual benefits of the non -complying Plan. Right To Receive And Release Needed Information Certain information is needed to apply these COB rules. We have the right to decide which information it needs. By enrolling in this Plan you c onsent to the release of information necessary to apply the COB rules. Anyone claiming benefits under this Plan must furnish information to Us which We determine is necessary for the coordination of benefits. Facility Of Payment A payment made or a servic e provided under another Plan may include an amount which should have been paid or provided under this Plan. If it does, we may pay, on behalf of the Group, that amount to the organization which made that payment. Such amount shall then be considered as th ough it were a benefit paid under this Plan. Right Of Recovery If the amount of the payments made by Us, on behalf of the Group, is more than it should have paid under this COB provision, or if it has provided services which should have been paid by the P rimary Plan, We may recover the excess or the reasonable cash value of the Covered Services, as applicable, from one or more of the persons it has paid or for whom it has paid, insurance companies, or other organizations. The right of the Plan to recover from you shall be limited to the Allowable Expense that you have received from another Plan. Acceptance of Covered Services will constitute consent by you to Our right of recovery. You agree to take all further action to execute and deliver such documents that may be required and do whatever else is necessary to secure the Plan's rights to recover excess payments. Your failure to comply may result in a withdrawal of benefits already provided or a denial of benefits requested. We have, as the Claims Adminis trator, the right to enforce the Group's rights under this provision. 96 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Member Rights and Responsibilities As a Member you have rights and responsibilities when receiving health care.

This will not be more often than once a year after the two -year period following the child reaching the limiting age. You must give the proof at no cost to us. You may be required to give proof of continued eligibility for any enrolled child. Your failure to give this information could result in termination of a child's coverage. To obtain coverage for children, you may be required to give us a copy of any legal documents awarding guardianship of such child(ren) to you. 105 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Types of Coverage Your Group offers the enrollme nt options listed below. After reviewing the available options, you may choose the option that best meets your needs. The options are as follows: Subscriber only (also referred to as single coverage); Subscriber and spouse; Subscriber and one child; Subsc riber and children; Subscriber and family. When You Can Enroll Initial Enrollment The Group will offer an initial enrollment period to new Subscribers and their Dependents when the Subscriber is first eligible for coverage. Coverage will be effective based on the waiting period chosen by the Group, and will not exceed 90 days. If you did not enroll yourself and/or your Dependents during the initial enrollment period you will only be able to enroll during an Open Enrollment period or during a Special Enrollment period, as described below. Open Enrollment Open Enrollment refers to a period of time, usually 60 days, during which eligible Subscribers and Dependents can apply for or change coverage. Open Enrollment occurs only once per year. The Group will notify you when Open Enrollment is available. Special Enrollment Periods If a Subscriber or Dependent does not apply for coverage when they were first eligible, they may be able to join the Plan prior to Open Enrollment if they qualify for Spec ial Enrollment. Except as noted otherwise below, the Subscriber or Dependent must request Special Enrollment within 31 days of a qualifying event. Special Enrollment is available for eligible individuals who: Lost eligibility under a prior health plan fo r reasons other than non -payment of Fees or due to fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact; Exhausted COBRA benefits, or stopped receiving Group contributions toward the cost of the prior health plan; Lost employer contributions towards the cost of the other coverage; Are now eligible for coverage due to marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. Important Notes about Special Enrollment: Members who enroll during Special Enrollment are not considered Late Enrollees. Individuals must request coverage within 31 days of a qualifying event (i.e., marriage, exhaustion of COBRA, etc.).106 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program Special Enrollment Eligible Subscribers and Dependents may also enroll under two additional circumstances: The Subscriber's or Dependent's Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility; or The Subscriber or Dependent becomes eligible for a subsidy (state prem ium assistance program). The Subscriber or Dependent must request Special Enrollment within 60 days of the above events. Late Enrollees If the Subscriber does not enroll themselves and/or their Dependents when first eligible or during a Special Enrollmen t period, they will not be eligible to enroll until the next Open Enrollment Period. Members Covered Under the Group's Prior Plan Members who were previously enrolled under another plan offered by the Group that is being replaced by this Plan are eligible for coverage on the Effective Date of this coverage. If at the time of the Effective Date of coverage you or your covered dependents become eligible for coverage under this Plan while inpatient at a Hospital, Hospice, Skilled Nursing Facility, Rehabilita tion Facility or Residential Treatment Facility, the coverage under this Plan will be effective. To the extent that the costs of hospitalization, inpatient stay or any medical care relating to that hospitalization or inpatient stay are the responsibility o f a previous carrier, the payment of these claims will be coordinated with the previous carrier in accordance with State law. You should notify us when an inpatient stay under these circumstances occurs. Enrolling Dependent Children Newborn Children Newbo rn children are covered automatically from the moment of birth. Following the birth a child, you should submit an application / change form to the Group within 61 days to add the newborn to your Plan. Even if no additional Fees are required, you should still submit an application / change form to the Group to add the newborn to your Plan, to make sure we have accurate records and are able to cover your claims. Adopted Children A child will be considered adopted from the earlier of: (1) the moment of placement in your home; or (2) the date of an entry of an order granting custody of the child to you. The child will continue to be considered adopted unless the child is removed from your home prio r to issuance of a legal decree of adoption. Your Dependent's Effective Date will be the date of the adoption or placement for adoption if you send the Group the completed application / change form within 60 days of the event. 107 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Adding a Child due to Award of Legal Custody or Guardianship If you or your spouse is awarded legal custody or guardianship for a child, an application must be submitted within 60 days of the date legal custody or guardianship is awarded by the court. Coverage will be effective on t he date the court granted legal custody or guardianship. Qualified Medical Child Support Order If you are required by a qualified medical child support order or court order, as defined by ERISA and/or applicable state or federal law, to enroll your child in this Plan, we will permit the child to enroll at any time without regard to any Open Enrollment limits and will provide the benefits of this Plan according to the applicable requirements of such order. However, a child's coverage will not extend beyond any Dependent Age Limit listed in \"Who is Eligible for Coverage\" under \"Dependents\". Updating Coverage and/or Removing Dependents You are required to notify the Group of any changes that affect your eligibility or the eligibility of your Dependents for th is Plan. When any of the following occurs, contact the Group and complete the appropriate forms: Changes in address; Marriage or divorce; Death of an enrolled family member (a different type of coverage may be necessary); Enrollment in another health plan or in Medicare; Eligibility for Medicare; Dependent child reaching the Dependent Age Limit (see \"Termination and Continuation of Coverage\"); Enrolled Dependent child either becomes totally or permanently disabled, or is no longer disabled. Failure to not ify us or the Group of individuals no longer eligible for services will not obligate us to cover such services, even if Fees are received for those individuals. All notifications must be in writing and on approved forms. Nondiscrimination No person who is eligible to enroll will be refused enrollment based on health status, health care needs, genetic information, previous medical information, disability, sexual orientation or identity, gender, or age. Statements and Forms All Members must complete and submit applications, or other forms or statements that we or the Group may reasonably be requested. Any rights to benefits under this Plan are subject to the condition that all such information is true, correct, and complete. Any material misrepresentation by you may result in termination of coverage as provided in the \"Termination and Continuation of Coverage\" section. The Plan will not use a statement made by you to void your coverage after that coverage has been in effect for t wo years. This does not apply, however, to fraudulent misstatements. 108 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Termination and Continuation of Coverage Termination Except as otherwise provided, your coverage may terminate in the following situations: When the Contract or Administrative Services Agreement between the Group and us terminates. If your coverage is through an association, your coverage will terminate when the Contract between the association and us terminates, or when your Group leaves the association. It will be the Group's responsib ility to notify you of the termination of coverage. If you choose to terminate your coverage. If you or your Dependents cease to meet the eligibility requirements of the Plan, subject to any applicable continuation requirements. If you cease to be eligib le, the Group and/or you must notify us immediately. The Group and/or you shall be responsible for payment for any services incurred by you after you cease to meet eligibility requirements. If you elect coverage under another carrier's health benefit plan , which is offered by the Group as an option instead of this Plan, subject to the consent of the Group. The Group agrees to immediately notify us that you have elected coverage elsewhere. If you perform an act, practice, or omission that constitutes fraud or make an intentional misrepresentation of material fact, as prohibited by the terms of your Plan, your coverage and the coverage of your Dependents can be retroactively terminated or rescinded. A rescission of coverage means that the coverage may be leg ally voided back to the start of your coverage under the Plan, just as if you never had coverage under the Plan. You will be provided with a 30 -calendar day advance notice with appeal rights before your coverage is retroactively terminated or rescinded. Yo u are responsible for paying us for the cost of previously received services based on the Maximum Allowed Amount for such services, less any Copayments made or Fees paid for such services. If you fail to pay or fail to make satisfactory arrangements to pa y your portion of the Fees, your coverage and the coverage of your Dependents may terminate. If you permit the use of your or any other Member's Plan Identification Card by any other person; use another person's Identification Card; or use an invalid Iden tification Card to obtain services, your coverage will terminate immediately. Anyone involved in the misuse of a Plan Identification Card will be liable to and must reimburse the Plan for the Maximum Allowed Amount for services received through such misuse . You will be notified in writing of the date your coverage ends by either us or the Group. Removal of Members Upon written request through the Group, you may cancel your coverage and/or your Dependent's coverage from the Plan. If this happens, no benefits will be provided for Covered Services after the termination date. 109 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Continuation of Coverage Under Federal Law (COBRA) The following applies if you are covered by a Group that is subject to the requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, as amended. COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose coverage under your Group's health Plan. It can also become available to other Members of your family, who are covered un der the Group's health Plan, when they would otherwise lose their health coverage. For additional information about your rights and duties under federal law, you should contact the Group. Qualifying events for Continuation Coverage under Federal Law (COBR A) COBRA continuation coverage is available when your coverage would otherwise end because of certain \"qualifying events\". After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary\". You, your spou se and your Dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if you were covered on the day before the qualifying event and your coverage would be lost because of the qualifying event. Qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA must pay for this COBRA continuation coverage. This benefit entitles each Member of your family who is enrolled in the Plan to elect continuation independently. Each qualified beneficiary has the right to make independent benefit elections at the time of annual enrollment. Cover ed Subscribers may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents or legal guardians may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. A child born to, or placed for adoption with, a covered Subscriber during the period of continuation coverage is also eligible for election of continuation coverage. 110 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Qualifying Event Length of Availability of Coverage For Subscribers: Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than gross misconduct) or Loss of Coverage Under an Employer's Health Plan Due to Reduction In Hours Worked 18 months For Dependents: A Covered Subscriber's Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than gross misconduct) or Loss of Coverage Under an Employer's Health Plan Due to Reduction In Hours Worked Covered Subscriber's Entitlement to Medicare Divorce or Legal Separation Death of a Covered Subscriber 18 months 36 months 36 months 36 months For Dependent Children: Loss of Dependent Child Status 36 months COBRA coverage will end before the end of the maximum continuation period listed above if you become entitled to Medicare benefits. In that case, a qualified beneficiary - other than the Medicare beneficiary - is entitled to continuation coverage for no more than a total of 36 months. (For example, if you become entitled to Medicare prior to termination of employment or reduction in hours, COBRA continuation coverage for your spouse and children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement.) If Your Group Offers Retirement Coverage If you are a retiree under this Plan, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code may be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to your Group, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage, you will become a qualified beneficiary with respect to the bankruptcy. Your Dependents will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under this Plan. If COBRA coverage becomes available to a retiree and his or her covered family members as a result of a bankruptcy filing, the retiree may continue coverage for life and his or her Dependents may also continue coverage for a maximum of up to 36 mont hs following the date of the retiree's death. Second qualifying event If your family has another qualifying event (such as a legal separation, divorce, etc.) during the initial 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, your Dependents can receive up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months from the original qualifying event. Such additional coverage is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused your Dependents to lose coverage under the Plan ha d the first qualifying event not occurred. 111 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Notification Requirements The Group will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Group has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the Subscriber, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer, or the Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), the Group w ill notify the COBRA Administrator (e.g., Human Resources or their external vendor) of the qualifying event. You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For other qualifying events (e.g., divorce or legal separation of the Subscriber and spouse or a Dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a Dependent child), you must notify the Group within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs. Electing COBRA Continuation Coverage To continue your coverage, you or an eligible family Member must make a n election within 60 days of the date your coverage would otherwise end, or the date the company's benefit Plan Administrator notifies you or your family Member of this right, whichever is later. You must pay the total Fees appropriate for the type of bene fit coverage you choose to continue. If the Fees rate changes for active associates, your monthly Fees will also change. The Fees you must pay cannot be more than 102% of the Fees charged for Employees with similar coverage, and it must be paid to the comp any's benefit plan administrator within 30 days of the date due, except that the initial Fees payment must be made before 45 days after the initial election for continuation coverage, or your continuation rights will be forfeited. Disability extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage For Subscribers who are determined, at the time of the qualifying event, to be disabled under Title II (OASDI) or Title XVI (SSI) of the Social Security Act, and Subscribers who become disabled during the first 60 d ays of COBRA continuation coverage, coverage may continue from 18 to 29 months. These Subscribers' Dependents are also eligible for the 18 - to 29 -month disability extension. (This also applies if any covered family Member is found to be disabled.) This wou ld only apply if the qualified beneficiary gives notice of disability status within 60 days of the disabling determination. In these cases, the Employer can charge 150% of Fees for months 19 through 29. This would allow health coverage to be provided in th e period between the end of 18 months and the time that Medicare begins coverage for the disabled at 29 months. (If a qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to no longer be disabled, such qualified beneficiary must notify the Plan Administrator of that fact in writing within 30 days after the Social Security Administration's determination.) Trade Adjustment Act Eligible Individual If you don't initially elect COBRA coverage and later become eligible for trade adjustment assistance under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 due to the same event which caused you to be eligible initially for COBRA coverage under this Plan, you will be entitled to another 60 -day period in which to elect COBRA coverage. This second 60 -day pe riod will commence on the first day of the month on which you become eligible for trade adjustment assistance. COBRA coverage elected during this second election period will be effective on the first day of the election period. 112 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 When COBRA Coverage Ends COBRA benefits are available without proof of insurability and coverage will end on the earliest of the following: A covered individual reaches the end of the maximum coverage period; A covered individual fails to pay a required Fees on time; A covered indi vidual becomes covered under any other group health plan after electing COBRA. If the other group health plan contains any exclusion or limitation on a pre -existing condition that applies to you, you may continue COBRA coverage only until these limitations cease; A covered individual becomes entitled to Medicare after electing COBRA; or The Group terminates all of its group welfare benefit plans. Other Coverage Options Besides COBRA Continuation Coverage Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is calle d a \"special enrollment period.\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov . If You Have Questions Questions concerning your Group's health Plan and your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the Group. For more information about your rights under ERISA, including COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EB SA) in your area or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/ebsa . (Addresses and phone numbers of Regional and District EBSA Offices are available through EBSA's website.) Continuation of Coverage Due To Military Service Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), the Subscriber or his / her Dependents may have a right to continue health care coverage under the Plan if the Subscriber must take a leave of absence from work due to military leave. Employers must give a cumulative total of five years and in certain instances more than five years, of military leave. \"Military service\" means performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, and full -time National Guard duty. During a military leave covered by USERRA, the law requires employers to continue to give coverage under this Pla n to its Members. The coverage provided must be identical to the coverage provided to similarly situated, active employees and Dependents. This means that if the coverage for similarly situated, active employees and Dependents is modified, coverage for you (the individual on military leave) will be modified. You may elect to continue to cover yourself and your eligible Dependents by notifying your employer in advance and submitting payment of any required contribution for health coverage. This may include the amount the employer normally pays on your behalf. If your military service is for a period of time less than 113 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 31 days, you may not be required to pay more than the active Member contribution, if any, for continuation of health coverage. For military lea ves of 31 days or more, you may be required to pay up to 102% of the full cost of coverage, i.e., the employee and employer share. The amount of time you continue coverage due to USERRA will reduce the amount of time you will be eligible to continue cover age under COBRA. Maximum Period of Coverage During a Military Leave Continued coverage under USERRA will end on the earlier of the following events: The date you fail to return to work with the Group following completion of your military leave. Subscribers must return to work within: The first full business day after completing military service, for leaves of 30 days or less. A reasonable amount of travel time will be allowed for returning from such military service. 14 days after completing military service for leaves of 31 to 180 days, 90 days after completing military service for leaves of more than 180 days; or 24 months from the date your leave began. Reinstatement of Coverage Following a Military Leave Regardless of whether y ou continue coverage during your military leave, if you return to work your health coverage and that of your eligible Dependents will be reinstated under this Plan if you return within: 1.The first full business day of completing your military service, for leaves of 30 days or less. A reasonable amount of travel time will be allowed for returning from such military service; 2.14 days of completing your military service for leaves of 31 to 180 days; or 3.90 days of completing your military service for leaves of m ore than 180 days. If, due to an illness or injury caused or aggravated by your military service, you cannot return to work within the time frames stated above, you may take up to: 1.Two years; or 2.As soon as reasonably possible if, for reasons beyond your control you cannot return within two years because you are recovering from such illness or injury. If your coverage under the Plan is reinstated, all terms and conditions of the Plan will apply to the extent that they would have applied if you had not tak en military leave and your coverage had been continuous. Any waiting / probationary periods will apply only to the extent that they applied before.

We will not consider the Subscriber and his or her Dependents ineligible because the Subscriber is not at work. If the Subscriber ends their coverage during the leave, the Subscriber and any Dependents who were covered immediately before the leave may be added back to the Plan when the Subscriber returns to work without medical underwriting. To be added back to the Plan, the Group may have to give us evidence that the Family and Medical Leave Act applied to the Subscriber. We may require a copy of the health care Provider statement allowed by the Act. 115 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Right of Recovery for Municipal Groups To the extent permissible by law, Anthem BCBS shall have a right of recovery for the cost of Covered Services against Members enrolled in Plans sponsored by a municipality who receive benefits for Covered Services as a result of an accident or other act by a third party that causes injury to a Member where the Member later recovers damages from the third party (or its insurer) for injuries and other liabilities caused by the third party . Acceptance of Covered Services will constitute consent by the Member to Anthem BCBS's right of recovery. The Member agrees to take all further action to execute and deliver such additional instruments and to take such other action as Anthem BCBS shall require to implement this provision. Anthem BCBS will have the right to bring suit against such third party in the name of the Member and in its own name as subrogee. The Member shall do nothing to prejudice the rights given to Anthem BCBS by this provision without its consent. If a Member received payment from a third party by suit or settlement for the cost of Covered S ervices, such Member is obligated to reimburse Anthem BCBS less Anthem BCBS's pro rata share of the reasonable attorney's fees and cost the Member sustained in obtaining the recovery. In the case of any city, town, borough or municipality entitled to the rights granted under C.G.S. Section 7 -464 (c), as amended or superseded, this Booklet shall include the lien rights granted to the self -insured group under that Section of the law and shall be subject to the provisions contained in that Section. The emplo yee, covered dependent or family member shall reimburse the self -insured town, city, municipality or borough group from any tortfeasor recovery for medical, hospital and prescription expenses paid due to the negligence of a third party as limited by the pr ovisions of Section 7 -464 (c), as amended or superseded by law. For purposes of this subsection the definition of \"tortfeasor recovery\" means moneys paid by or on behalf of the person or entity whose negligence or recklessness caused the injuries for whic h medical, hospital and prescription expenses were incurred. We have established recovery policies to determine which recoveries are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and settle or compromise recovery amounts. We will not pursue recoveries f or overpayments if the cost of collection exceeds the overpayment amount. We may not provide you with notice of overpayments made by Us or you if the recovery method makes providing such notice administratively burdensome. 116 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 General Provisions Assignmen t The Group cannot legally transfer this Booklet, without obtaining written permission from us. Members cannot legally transfer the coverage. Benefits available under this Booklet are not assignable by any Member without obtaining written permission from u s, unless in a way described in this Booklet. Automobile Insurance To the extent allowed by law, we will not provide benefits under this plan for covered services paid, payable or required to be provided as basic benefits under any no -fault or other autom obile insurance policy. We have, on behalf of the Group, the right to: Charge the insurer, as allowed under such law, for the value of Covered Services that you are entitled; Charge you for the value of Covered Services for which you have received payment from any and all sources, including but not limited to first party payment. Reduce the amount we owe to you by the amount that you have received payment from any and all sources, including but not limited to first party payment. Apply your benefits under this Plan to the coordination of benefits rules described in the \"Coordination of Benefits When Members Are Insured Under More Than One Plan\" section, for Covered Services you receive under an automobile insurance policy which provides benefits without regard to fault. Consider you, your own insurer if you fail to secure no -fault insurance as required by law. Your benefits will be reduced for Covered Services by the amount that would have been covered (e.g., for basic benefits or other benefits provided for injury) if such a no -fault policy had been obtained. Require you to follow the guidelines and requirements of this Plan for Covered Services. If your benefits under a no -fault or other automobile insurance policy run out, then benefi ts will continue to be provided for Covered Services under this Plan provided they would otherwise be covered under this Plan. Please see the \"Getting Approval for Benefits\" section for more information. We have, as the Claims Administrator, the right to enforce the Group's rights under this provision. Care Coordination We pay , on behalf of the Group, In-Network Providers in various ways to provide Covered Services to you. For example, sometimes we may pay In -Network Providers a separate amount for each C overed Service they provide. We may also pay them one amount for all Covered Services related to treatment of a medical condition.

Confidentiality and Release of Information By your application, you have agreed to allow your Providers to give us, as Claims Administrator, the needed information about the care they provide to you, to the extent permitted by law. Applicable state and federal law requires us to undertake efforts to safeg uard your medical information.

This Booklet does not give anyone any claim, right, or cause of action against Anthem or the Group based on the actions of a Provider of health care, services, or supplies. The Group, Claim s Administrator, and Network Providers are independent entities contracting with each other for the sole purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Plan. The Plan will not be liable for any act or omission of any Provider or any agent or employee of a Provider. Network Physicians maintain the Physician -patient relationship with Members and are solely responsible to Members for all medical services they provide. Payment Innovation Programs We pay , on behalf of the Group, In-Network Providers through vari ous types of contractual arrangements. Some of these arrangements - Payment Innovation Programs (Program(s)) - may include financial incentives to help improve quality of care and promote the delivery of health care services in a cost - efficient manner. These Programs may vary in methodology and subject area of focus and may be modified by us from time to time, but they will be generally designed to tie a certain portion of an In -Network Provider's total compensation to pre -defined quality, cost, efficien cy or service standards or metrics. In some instances, In-Network Providers may be required to make payment to us under the Program as a consequence of failing to meet these pre -defined standards. The Programs are not intended to affect your access to hea lth care. The Program payments are not made as payment for specific Covered Services provided to you, but instead, are based on the In - Network Provider's achievement of these pre -defined standards. You are not responsible for any Copayment or Coinsurance a mounts related to payments made by us or to us under the Program(s), and you do not share in any payments made by Network Providers to us under the Program(s). 120 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Policies, Procedures, and Pilot Programs On behalf of the Group, we are able to adopt new polic ies, procedures, rules and interpretations, as long as they are reasonable.

Acceptance of these incentives is voluntary as long as Anthem of fers the incentives program. Motivational rewards, awards or points for achieving certain milestones may be a feature of the program. We may discontinue a program or an incentive for a particular covered program or service at any time. If you have any ques tions about whether receipt of an incentive or retailer coupon results in taxable income to you, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor. Relationship of Parties (Group -Member -Anthem) Neither the Group nor any Member is the agent or representative of the Plan. The Group is responsible for passing information to you. For example, if we give notice to the Group, it is the Group's responsibility to pass that information to you. The Group is also responsible for passing eligibility data to us in a timel y manner. If the Group does not give us timely enrollment and termination information, we are not responsible for the payment of Covered Services for Members, on behalf of the Group. Relationship of Parties (Anthem and In -Network Providers) The relationsh ip between Anthem and In -Network Providers is an independent contractor relationship. In - Network Providers are not agents or employees of ours, nor is Anthem, or any employee of Anthem, an employee or agent of In -Network Providers. Your health care Provid er is solely responsible for all decisions regarding your care and treatment, regardless of whether such care and treatment is a Covered Service under this Plan. We shall not be responsible for any claim or demand on account of damages arising out of, or i n any manner connected with, any injuries suffered by you while receiving care from any In -Network Provider or in any In -Network Provider's Facilities. 121 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Your In -Network Provider's agreement for providing Covered Services may include financial incentives or risk sharing relationships related to the provision of services or referrals to other Providers, including In - Network Providers, Out -of-Network Providers, and disease management programs.

Reservation of Discretionary Authority We, on behalf of the Group, shall have all the powers necessary or appropriate to enable us to carry out the duties in connection with the operation and administration of the Plan. This includes, without limitation, the power to construe the Administrative Services Agreement , to det ermine questions arising under the Booklet, to resolve Member Appeals, and to make, establish and amend the rules, regulations, and procedures with regard to the interpretation and administration of the provisions of this Plan. However, these powers shall be exercised in such a manner that has reasonable relationship to the provisions of the Administrative Services Agreement , the Booklet, Provider agreements, and applicable laws. A specific limitation or exclusion will override more general benefit language . We have complete discretion to interpret the Booklet. Our determination may include, without limitation, determination of whether the services, treatment, or supplies are Medically Necessary, Experimental/Investigative, whether surgery is cosmetic, and w hether charges are consistent with the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount. The Plan's decision shall not be overturned unless determined to be arbitrary and capricious, or upon the outcome of a Medically Necessary appeal. A Member may utilize all applicable App eals procedures. We have, as the Claims Administrator, the right to enforce the Group's rights under this provision. Right of Recovery and Adjustment Whenever payment has been made in error, we will , on behalf of the Group, have the right to recover such payment from you or, if applicable, the Provider or otherwise make appropriate adjustment to claims. In most instances such recovery or adjustment activity shall be limited to the calendar year in which the error is discovered. We have oversight responsi bility for compliance with Provider and vendor contracts. We may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may retain any recoveries made from a Provider or vendor resulting from these audits if the return of the ov erpayment is not feasible. Additionally, we have established recovery and adjustment policies to determine which recoveries and adjustments are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and settle or compromise recovery or adjustment amounts. We will not pursue recoveries for overpayments or adjustments for underpayments if the cost of the activity exceeds the overpayment or underpayment amount. The Claims Administrator reserves the right to deduct or offset, including cross plan offsetting on In - Network claims and on Out -Of-Network claims where the Out -Of-Network Provider agrees to cross plan offsetting, any amounts paid in error from any pending or future claim. Cross plan offsetting is a type of payment correction with a Provider. This occurs when we overpay a claim due to a billing error by a Provider (In -Network or Out -of-Network). The overpayment is then reimbursed to us, or offset, by adjusting another payment owed to the same Provider. We have, as the Claims Administrator, the right to enforc e the Group's rights under this provision. 122 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 Unauthorized Use of Identification Card If you permit your Identification Card to be used by someone else or if you use the card before coverage is in effect or after coverage has ended, you will be liable for pa yment of any expenses incurred resulting from the unauthorized use. Fraudulent misuse could also result in termination of the coverage. Value -Added Programs On behalf of the Group, we may offer health or fitness related programs to our Members, through which you may access discounted rates from certain vendors for products and services available to the general public. Products and services available under this program are not Covered S ervices under your Plan but are in addition to Plan benefits. As such, program features are not guaranteed under your health Plan Contract and could be discontinued at any time. We do not endorse any vendor, product or service associated with this program. Program vendors are solely responsible for the products and services you receive. Voluntary Clinical Quality Programs On behalf of the Group, we may offer additional opportunities to assist you in obtaining certain covered preventive or other care (e.g., well child check -ups or certain laboratory screening tests) that you have not received in the recommended timeframe. These opportunities are called voluntary clinical quality programs. They are designed to encourage you to get certain care when you need i t and are separate from Covered Services under your Plan. These programs are not guaranteed and could be discontinued at any time. We will give you the choice and if you choose to participate in one of these programs, and obtain the recommended care within the program's timeframe, you may receive incentives such as gift cards or retailer coupons, which we encourage you to use for health and wellness related activities or items. Under other clinical quality programs, you may receive a home test kit that allo ws you to collect the specimen for certain covered laboratory tests at home and mail it to the laboratory for processing. You may also be offered a home visit appointment to collect such specimens and complete biometric screenings. You may need to pay any cost shares that normally apply to such covered laboratory tests (e.g., those applicable to the laboratory processing fee) but will not need to pay for the home test kit or the home visit. If you have any questions about whether receipt of a gift card or r etailer coupon results in taxable income to you, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor. Value of Covered Services For purposes of subrogation, reimbursement of excess benefits, or reimbursement under any Workers' Compensation or Employer Liability Law, the value of Covered Services shall be the amount we paid for the Covered Services. Voluntary Wellness Incentive Programs We may offer health or fitness related program options for purchase by your Group to help you achieve your best health . These programs are not Covered Services under your Plan, but are separate components, which are not guaranteed under this Plan and could be discontinued at any time. If your Group has selected one of these options to make available to all employees, you may receive incentives such as gift cards by participating in or completing such voluntary wellness promotion programs as health 123 CT_ABCBS_LG-ASO_PPO_2023_CY_91625- 5DVM and 5J92 Anthem Century Preferred PPO $15/$50 Rx $10/$20/$20 assessments, weight management or tobacco cessation coaching. Under other options a Group may select, you may receive such ince ntives by achieving specified standards based on health factors under wellness programs that comply with applicable law. If you think you might be unable to meet the standard, you might qualify for an opportunity to earn the same reward by different means. You may contact us at the Member Services number on your ID card and we will work with you (and, if you wish, your Doctor) to find a wellness program with the same reward that is right for you in light of your health status. (If you receive a gift card as a wellness reward and use it for purposes other than for qualified medical expenses, this may result in taxable income to you. For additional guidance, please consult your tax advisor.)
