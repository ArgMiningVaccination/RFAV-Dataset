I ncludes sex workers, MSM, incarcerated populations, people who use drugs or alcohol , transgender populations , and AGYW . PEP Post -exposure prophylaxis of HIV infection - the preventive ARV medical treatment started immediately after exposure to HIV in order to prevent infection PrEP Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis of HIV infection is the use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV -negative people before potential exposure to prevent the acquisition of HIV. Currently PrEP refers to oral daily PrEP (tenofovir/emtricitabine or tenofovir alone) but may incorporate other formulations over time Serod iscordan t couples Couples in which one partner is HIV -positive and the other is HIV - negative , and they are in an ongoing sexual relationship Sex Worker Women, men, and transgendered people , of all ages, who work in different settings with the primary intention of exchanging money for sex. Substantial Risk Substantial risk of HIV infection is defined as a population group with an HIV incidence greater than 3 per 100 person -years in the absence of PrEP Transgender population Refers to people whose gender identity and expression are different to the social expectations of gender. They may see themselves as male, female, gender non -conformist, or one of many other gender - variant categories. Use of ARV drugs Refers to the HIV prevention benefits of using ARV drugs . This can Final Draft - 11 May 2016 v for HIV prevention include preventing mother -to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) by treating the mother during pregnancy and breastfeeding ), using ARV drugs to reduce the transmission of HIV among sero discordant couples, using ARV drugs to prevent people from acquiring HIV when they are exposed to HIV (post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre - exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) ), and ART for HIV -positive individuals to reduce viral load. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 1 1. Background and Rationale 1.1. WHO RECOMMENDATIONS Since first published in 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on the use of ART have evolved. Over the years, additional evidence has emerged showing that earlier initiation of ART results in better, long -term clinical outcomes for people living with H IV, resulting in a population impact on HIV transmission. Clinical trial results have also confirmed the efficacy of the drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), alone or in combination with emtricitabine (FTC), for use as PrEP to prevent people from acqu iring HIV in a wide variety of settings and populations1. The use of PrEP to prevent people from acquiring HIV is an important new additional prevention option for populations who are at a substantial risk of acquiring HIV. On 30 September 2015 WHO publi shed an early -release to the new guidelines on the use of ART for the prevention and early treatment of HIV infection. These new guidelines recommend the following: ART should be initiated in everyone living with HIV regardless of their CD4 cell count . People with a substantial risk of HIV infection should be provided with daily PrEP as part of a combined HIV prevention strategy. 1.2. SOUTH AFRICA CONTEXT South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic in the world, with 6.8 million people (ages 15 -49) living wi th HIV, representing 19% of the global HIV burden1. The South Africa HIV programme was launched in 2009 and, as of 2015, there are just over 3.3 million people on antiretroviral treatment (ART), creating the largest ART programme in the world2. Yet, despite this accelerated progress in initiating and treating HIV-positive people , there are still more than 3 million people that would need treatment in line with the 2015 WHO ART guidelines3. The epidemic has varied significant ly across and within different p rovinces in South Africa. Even though the epidemic is generalised , it is also over -represented in some populations, specifically Sex Workers (SW) and Men wh o have S ex with Men (MSM) . It is also concentrated in the populations with very high vuln erability to HIV, such as adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). This comprehensive contextual understanding of the HIV epidemic is critical in order for effective HIV interventions to be developed and implemented. Differential vulnerability levels , social risk factors, high -risk sexual practices , and limited access to appropriate HIV interventions , influences HIV incidence among these populations4,5,6. 1 Guidelines on When to Start Anti -Retroviral Therapy and on Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV. World Health Organization, Sept 2015. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 2 FIGURE 1.HIV PREVALENCE BY DISTRICT , SOUTH AFRICA 20127 These guidelines will focus on the provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) and universal test and treat (T&T) for sex workers (SW) as part of a comprehensive combination prevention and expanded treatment policy, and should be read in conjunction with the National PrEP and T&T Policy, The South African National Sex Worker HIV Plan (2016 - 2019 ), the National Strategic Plan for HIV, TB AND STIs (2012 - 2016) , and the National consolidated guidelines for the prevention of mother -to-child transmission of H IV (PMTCT) and the management of HIV in children, adolescents and adults (2015). 1.2.1. Sex Workers In these guidelines sex workers include : women, men, and transgendered populations , who sell sex regularly and occasionally, and those who may or may not self-identify as sex workers. Sex workers range in age, socio -economic status, and are of diverse sexual orientation and gender identities. The 2013 rapid population size estimate reported that there were around 153,000 sex workers (including male and transge nder sex workers) in South Africa8. Sex workers , including females, males, and transgendered populations, have disproportionately higher risk for HIV acquisition as behavioural, legal , and social barriers increase their vulnerability9. An estimated 20% of the 350,000 people annually infected with HIV in South Africa are connected with sex work10. HIV prevalence amongst female sex workers in South Africa is estimated to be 59.8%11. The SA Health Monitoring Survey of Female Sex Workers (SAHMS - FSW)12 estimates th e prevalence of HIV among female sex workers at 71.8% in Johannesburg, 39.7% in Cape Town, and 53.5% in eThekwini. The same report observed marked increases in HIV prevalence among female sex workers as they got older, with those aged 25 years and older co mpared to the 16 -24 age group (Johannesburg, 78.8% v. 59.0%; Durban 71.2% v. 29.4%), confirming the urgency of focused intervention for sex workers who are HIV -positive and on preventing HIV -negative sex workers from being infected. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 3 The data from the SAH MS-FSW confirm that female sex workers carry an enormous burden of HIV: at least one -third has been infected with HIV by the age of 24; among those 25 and older, as many as 4 in 5 are HIV -positive. Fortunately, the vast majority have tested for HIV, and mo re than three -quarters of HIV -positive female sex workers are aware of their status. Prevalence of syphilis among female sex workers in Johannesburg and Cape Town is among the highest measured in the southern African region13. In addition, sex workers conti nue to experience intense stigma and discrimination, violence (including sexual assault) with poor recourse to justice, legal barriers and constraints to accessing services14. Young sex workers may be more vulnerable to HIV than their older counterparts because of less power to negotiate condom use, greater susceptibility to violence and greater number of sexual partners due to exploitation and male age preferences15. By making PrEP and T&T available to sex workers, their HIV risk can be reduced . The evidence for inclusion of PrEP for sex workers is strong and there are existing platforms for health care delivery specifically targeted to these high -risk, hard to reach populations. For these reasons, roll out of PrEP and T&T should be considered in this group first16. In this respect, sex workers in South Africa have been prioritized as a population at substantial risk due to lack of power to insist on condoms, high rates of gender based violence and rape, and lack of legal protection. 1.3. COMBINATION PREVENTION Combination HIV prevention is an approach that seeks to achieve maximum impact on preventing new HIV infections by combining biomedical, socio -behavioural , and structural interventions that are human -rights based and evidence informed, in the context of a well - researched and understood local epidemic. The combination prevention package for SW includes: condoms, lubricants, STI management, screening and manag ement of intimate partner violence, sexual and reproductive health services, and HIV services, including counselling and testing, HIV management, ART, PEP, and PrEP17. Combination prevention programmes are: ...rights -based, evidence -informed, and commun ity- owned programmes that use a mix of biomedical, behavioural, and structural interventions, prioritized to meet the current HIV prevention needs of particular individuals and communities, so as to have the greatest sustained impact on reducing new infect ions. Well -designed combination prevention programmes are carefully tailored to national and local needs and conditions; focus resources on the mix of programmatic and policy actions required to address both immediate risks and underlying vulnerability; an d they are thoughtfully planned and managed to operate synergistically and consistently on multiple levels (e.g. individual, relationship, community, society) and over an adequate period of time. They mobilize community, private sector, government and glob al resources in a collective undertaking; require and benefit from enhanced partnership and coordination; and they incorporate mechanisms for learning, capacity building and flexibility to permit continual improvement and adaptation to the changing environ ment. - UNAIDS Prevention Reference Group Final Draft - 11 May 2016 4 1.4. TEST AND TREAT ALL Globally, around one -third of the 15 million individuals who are eligible for tre atment are currently receiving ART18 and for each person started on ART, at least two more individuals become newly infected with HIV (*reference) . This causes a continuous increase in the number of HIV -positive people who will require ART in future, in the absence of substantial reductions in HIV incidence. Th e WHO has recommended that ART should be initiated among all adults and children with HIV regardless of WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 cell count, prioritising those with severe or advanced HIV clinical disease (WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 ) and adults with CD4 count 500 cells/mm3. Earlier initiation of ART results in better long -term clinical outcomes for HIV-positive people and reduces an individuals viral load and hence their infectiousness . The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 052 study showed that starting ART early reduced the overall risk of HIV sexual transmission to uninfected partners by 93%19. With approximately 6 .8 million people infected with HIV in South Africa, and just over 3 million on ART, there is an unmet need of approximately 50 %. T&T is proposed as a new, highly effec tive, HIV prevention strategy. T&T interventions are built around two main components: First, HIV testing services (HTS) are offered to all members of a defined high - risk population to identify those already infecte d with HIV, but not yet linked to care, and thereafter regular and repeat HIV testing of those who test HIV -negative to identify new positives as early as possible after seroconversion. Second, the initiation of life -long ART immediately after HIV diagnosi s, regardless of CD4 count20, 21, 22. To test and treat al l has the potential to cause a very steep reduction in HIV incidence , will reduce HIV -related morbidity and mortality, and could potentially eliminate HIV as a public health problem over a period of 15 -20 years23. WHO recommends that all HIV infected individuals be started on ART regardless of their CD4 count. South Africa will adopt a phased approach in the implementation of T&T . Initial targeting of sex workers provides a tangible benefit of reducing the burden of HIV-infection. The T&T approach24 will be extended to all sex workers . HIV-positive sex w orkers will be offered immediate initiat ion on ART , regardless of CD4 count or clinical staging , in line with the National consolidated guidelines for the prevention of mother -to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) and the management of HIV in children, adolescents and adults (2015) . HIV - negative sex w orker s will be offered PrEP at selected sites that have met clinical and service delivery criteria . 1.5. ORAL PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS PrEP is defined by WHO as the use of an tiret roviral drugs by HIV -negative people, before potential exposure to prevent the acquisition of HIV. Oral PrEP is an evidence based HIV risk-reduction intervention to be offered to all people at substantial risk of acquiring HIV25. Substantial risk of HIV infection is defined by WHO as a population group with an HIV incidence greater than 3 per 100 person -years in the absence of PrEP26. Defining who should be offered PrEP requires a country to balance the risk of HIV exposure, the (low) risk of serious adverse events, and available resources. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 5 The WHO recommends that PrEP , ld be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of a combination of prevention approaches that include : HTS, counselling, male and female condoms, lubricants, ART for HIV-positive partners in serodiscordant couples, and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) . Populations who would benefit most from PrEP are often underserved and likely to also have low level s of HIV testing and high levels of undiagnosed HIV and may n eed to be linked to other services . PrEP has been shown to be safe , with minimal side effects27, 28. One of the main guiding principles for PrEP as an intervention is that it will enable and empower people to have an informed and additional voluntary choice of an HIV prevention method . The evidence and benefits of PrEP are summarized in Appendix 1. 1.6. IMPLEMENTATION OF PREP AND T&T To inform the implementation of PrEP and T&T among sex worker s, the evidence from several demonstration projects will be used . The demonstration projects will enable the country to scale up PrEP and T&T . The platform of delivery will be through existing sex worker program mes and linked to primary health care facilities, where appropriate , with the aim of integrating them into existing public health services (refer to PrEP and T&T Implementation plan). 1.7. ADHERENCE Adherence is important in both PrEP use and HIV treatment, and will form an integral part of the combination prevention and T&T programme. Adherence is a significant modifier of PrEP effectiveness. Effective PrEP use is different from HIV treatment in that PrEP can be started and stopped as a person moves through \"seasons of risk\", whereas ART is lifelong. 1.8. ORAL PREP : TDF AND TDF/FTC Tenofovir (TDF) and tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in a single tablet fixed dose combination (FDC) are the oral antiretroviral agents used in oral PrEP studies to date. A systematic review and meta -analysis of PrEP trials containing TDF demonstrated that the level of protection from TDF versus TDF/FTC did not differ by age, gender, regimen, or mode Effective use of PrE P requires daily usage. It should be taken for a specified period, initially for attainment of full protection, followed by daily use for the duration of possible exposure to HIV infection, followed by a continuous use for one month after the cessation of exposure. Good quality counselling fosters adherence and supports a comprehensive plan for sexual and reproductive health. It is important to offer a combination prevention package of services for PrEP users to further decrease risk of HIV infection. Thes e include: VMMC , consistent and correct use of condoms, use of lubricants, and risk assessment and reduction. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 6 of acquiring HIV (rectal, penile, or vaginal). In a meta -analysis , conducted in May 2015, of all PrEP trials, daily oral TDF has comparable efficacy to TDF/FTC. In clinical trials, it has been shown that the difference in efficacy between TDF/FTC and TDF alone is in significant. However, the use of TDF monotherapy for HIV prevention has not been investigated in some key populations and on this basis, the South ern Africa n HIV Clinicians Society (SAHIVCS) recommends the use of TDF/FTC in combination for oral PrEP. In South Africa, as of December 2015, the TDF/FTC combination pill , also known as Truvada \u00ae, was approved for use as PrEP by the Medicine Control Council (MCC) , in combination with safer sexual practices. TDF alone has not yet been approved for use as PrEP by the MCC , and to date, no applications have been made to the MCC for registration of TDF for PrEP use . 1.8.1. Daily PrEP vs non -daily PrEP WHO does not currently recommend intermittent use of PrEP . The ADAPT study (H PTN 067) conducted among women in Cape Town, evaluated the feasibility of non -daily oral PrEP using Truvada29. The study showed that there was b etter adherence and better coverage of potential sexual exposure when PrEP is taken daily . Daily adherence is more forgiving30 in the case of missed doses and results in more sustained use during periods of HIV acquisition risk, as opposed to intermittent use. 1.9. HIV DRUG R ESISTANCE The risk of HIV drug resistance to either TDF or FTC is low, occurring in approximately 1 in 1,000 PrEP users in clinical trials , and was mainly seen in those with acute undetected HIV infection at the time of initiating PrEP. Various trials have shown that the overall implementation of PrEP is expected to decrease the public health burden of HIV drug resistance31, 32, 33. Had the averted infections occurred in the absence of PrEP, more resistance would be expected to occur during the treatment of these infections than occurred due to PrEP use . 1.10. PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING * Please note - awaiting feedback and recommen dations from the WHO March meeting. They are currently reviewing safety data from women taking TDF for HIV treatment and Hep B treatment, and at 3 PrEP studies which looked at pregnancy outcomes when PrEP was taken at conception and in early pregnancy. With feedback we will have better detail of the guidance to provide to health care practitioners for the provision of PrEP to these populations. In South Africa, the currently approved form of TDF/FTC , Truvada, is contra -indicated for use as PrEP in pregnant or breastfeeding women. However, as the risk of seroconversion during pregnancy is high, the risks and benefits of PrEP should be discussed with potential PrEP users, allowing these women at high risk of HIV acquisition to make an infor med decision regarding PrEP use. HIV-negative women in serodiscordant relationships are at risk of acquiring HIV infection whilst trying to conceive through unprotected sex. Pregnancy itself is Final Draft - 11 May 2016 7 also associated with an increased risk of becoming infected wi th HIV34. The use of PrEP around the time of conception and during pregnancy offers a means of protection to the uninfected partner. Unfortunately, data relating to the safety of PrEP specifically with regard to the developing foetus are limited *, and conse quently the onus is on the clinician to discuss potential risks and benefits of PrEP initiation or maintenance during pregnancy with the client. PrEP trials involving heterosexual women excluded pregnant women from enrollment, and those who fell pregnant during the conduct of the study were discontinued from PrEP. One study of 46 uninfected women in serodiscordant relationships demonstrated no adverse effects on the pregnancy or cases of HIV transmission when TDF was used around the time of conception. The re are several ongoing demonstration projects that will allow women to continue PrEP if they fall pregnant, which will provide some data to inform future recommendations. In addition, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry shows no evidence of adverse outco mes amongst infants exposed to these medications when used as ART in utero. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 8 2. Guiding Principles The use of PrEP and T&T aim to contribute to the country's targets for HIV reduction by 2030, as reflected in the National Development Plan . South Africa supports the UNAIDS Fast Track approach, the 90-90-90 targets, and the prevention target of reducing the number of new HIV infections by 75% by 2020. To achieve these goals, there is a need for an expanded and accelerated scale up of HIV treatment and comb ination prevention, including PrEP. These new guidelines will assist in providing the necessary guidance towards improved management of HIV prevention across different populations. BOX 1. OBJECTIVES OF THE PREP AND TEST & TREAT GUIDELINES 2.1. ENABLING AND EMPOWERING INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE AN INFORMED AND VOLUNTARY CHOICE OF HIV PREVENTION These guidelines are underpinned by a rights -based approach, whereby individuals are provided with information that will enable them to voluntarily make decisions on options for HIV prevention. A rights -based approach also includes confi dentiality and equal access to non-discriminatory health care, privacy, prevention choice, informed decision -making, and shared responsibility. 2.2. INCREASED EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY FOR THE HIV PROGRAMME Two important objectives of the HIV programme are to avert new HIV infections and impr ove access to ART. Both PrEP and T&T will con tribute to increase d effectiveness of the HIV programme. Averted HIV infection s translates to a reduced burden on the national health system , and each new ly identified HIV-positive person treated reduces the burden on the clients and their families and communities. 2.3. INTEGRATION OF PREP AND TEST & TREAT ACROSS VARIOUS ENTRY POINTS Expanded prevention o ptions: Offer and promote PrEP in the context of combination prevention. Integration: Integrate PrEP and T&T into other HIV prevention programmes, policies, and services, as well as sexual and reproductive health, contraception and fertility planning services, and ANC services . Quality of c are: Provide PrEP within the broader framework of quality health service provision. Communication and community based s trategies: Implement a ppropriate, evidence - informed, communication and advocacy strategies to increase healthcare provider and public awarenes s of PrEP and T&T within the context of HIV prevention without stigmatising the intervention and potential users, n or increasing risky sexual behaviour. Monitoring and e valuation: M&E systems are in place to monitor and evaluate provision, quality of care, outcomes, and impact. *From the National PrEP and T&T Policy Final Draft - 11 May 2016 9 PrEP and T&T will be integrated into all the entry points of the public health s ystem ( primary health care (PHC) clinics , HTS, ANC, SRH services, contraception and fertility services , VMMC services, STI and TB screening, ToP services, post -rape care services , etc.) This will mitigate against stigmatisation when trying to obtain HTS and PrEP ser vices. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 10 3. PrEP Clinical Guidelines The implementation of PrEP will increase the use of HTS, which will assist in getting people to know their HIV status. Those that test HIV -positive during screening should immediately be referred for HIV treatment and care. It is therefore important to establish a seamless transition between PrEP and HIV treatment programmes. PrEP should not displace or undermine the use of other effective and well -established HIV combination prevention interventions. PrEP should be pr omoted as an additional prevention choice among sex workers in conjunction with other appropriate prevention methods. For those that test HIV positive during HTS, please refer to the National consolidated guidelines for the prevention of mother -to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) and the management of HIV in children, adolescents and adults (2015) for the appropriate treatment options . 3.1. ENROLMENT FOR PREP Some individuals requesting PrEP are likely to be at ongoing or substantial risk for HIV and might always fall into a window period when trying to confirm HIV status (e.g. a sex worker with recurrent daily exposures). These individuals should not be excluded from accessing PrEP , as they potentially have the most to gain from the intervention. Risk as sessment questions can be used as part of combination prevention to explore risk and risk reduction and prevention strategies. BOX 2. RISK REDUCTION COUNSELLING Following HIV testing, if sex worker is HIV -positive, immediately refer for ART initiation . If sex worker is HIV -negative, PrEP should be offered after screening as part of a combination prevention package (refer to algorithm on page 16 ). 3.2. CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR PREP The following are contraindications for PrEP use: Pre-existing HIV infection Explore the following topics as appropriate: Avoiding unprotected sex Consistent and correct use of condoms Knowing your HIV status and your partner's HIV status Are you or your partner on ART? Use of recreational or injection drugs for you or your client or partner Sex under the in fluence of alcohol and/or drugs Experience of intimate partner violence/sexual violence Use of ARVs to prevent HIV following unprotected sex (PEP) Final Draft - 11 May 2016 11 Creatinine clearance of less than 60m L/min Adolescents <35kg or <15 years of age who are not Tanner stage 3 (sexual maturity rating) or greater Unwilling/unable to adhere to daily PrEP Pregnancy (as per Truvada package insert) *refer to section 1.10 Other i mportant considerations include : TDF/FTC is active against Hepatitis B infection. Discontinuation of TDF/FTC requires close monitoring in those infected with Hepatitis B due to the concern for rebound viraemia . Persons with osteopenia/osteomalacia/osteoporosis may be at risk of bone loss associated with TDF . Women who want to conceive and are eligible for PrEP must be monitored . After discussing the potential risks of TDF/FTC, recommend continuation of PrEP during pregnancy or breastfeeding for those with ongoing risk for HIV exposure (refer to section 1.10). TDF should not be co -administered with other nephroto xic drugs, e.g. aminoglycosides . Standard TB medication does not interact with PrEP drugs and there is no need for dose adjustments. Clients on MDR -TB medications may have increase d risk of renal side effects. P rEP should therefore be avoided. Other prevention methods should be recommended and PrEP screening should be delayed until the end of MDR -TB treatment. Standard hormonal contraception does not affect PrEP effectiveness nor does PrEP affect contraceptive effectiveness35. There are currently no published studies on the use of PrEP for individuals younger than 18 years of age. Offer immediate treatment if PrEP user seroconverts. 3.3. ELIGIBILITY FOR PREP USE Providers should educate and counsel potential PrEP users about PrEP , which should always be provided as part of a combination prevention package. BOX 3. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PREP USE TABLE 1. ACUTE VIRAL SYMPTOMS OF HIV SEROCONVERSION36, 37 Symptom Sign Malaise, anorexia, myalgia , headache, sore throat , sore glands, r ash sweating, viral meningitis, or FTC HIV-negative No s uspicion of acute HIV infection (refer to Table 1) Willing and able to adhere to PrEP Final Draft - 11 May 2016 12 If the client has symptoms or signs of acute HIV infection, PrEP should be postponed until symptoms subside and a repeat rapid HIV test after 4 weeks remains negative. 3.4. BASELINE INVESTIGATIONS TABLE 2. CLINICAL SCREENING INVESTIGATIONS Investi gation Purpose HIV test (using algorithm in the HTS guidelines ) Assessment of HIV status Creatinine clearance To identify pre -existing renal disease Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) * To identify undiagnosed hepatitis B infection To identify those eligible for vaccination against hepatitis B ALT if HBsAg positive To determine if vaccination against HBV infection or treatment of HBV is required Urine pregnancy test To identify if client is pregnant RPR To diagnose syphilis infection for treatment Syndromic STI screening To diagnose and treat STI Clients with acute or chronic hepatitis B infection can be safely initiated onto PrEP but require liver function monitoring38. Bone density measurements are not needed Clients with abnormal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) s hould not initiate PrEP and the test must be repeated after two weeks . If renal function returns to normal and other PrEP criteria are met, PrEP may be initiated. 3.5. PRESCRIPTION OF PREP DRUGS The recommended regimen , which can be used in all populations is: Truvada (TDF/FTC) 1 tablet PO daily Prescription intervals: At initiation - provide 1 -month supply At 1 month - repeat HIV test and provide 3 -month supply Every 3 months - repeat HIV test and provide 3 -monthly supply Other HIV prevention methods should be discussed and provided at all visits. Users should be advised that a negative HIV test is required before PrEP drugs can be prescribed at initiation and with every prescription r efill, as well as when re starting after a discontinuation . It should be made clear that PrEP is not treatment for HIV, despite using the same medicines, and therefore it should not be shared with people who have not tested HIV negative. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 13 3.6. SIDE EFFECTS The major toxicities associated with TDF/FTC are rare in PrEP exposure to date. Minor side effects are relatively common but are mild and self -limiting if they do occur (approximately 1 in 10 individuals in the first 1 -2 months), and do not require discontinuation of PrEP. BOX 4. POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS 3.7. PREP CLIENTS WHO TEST HIV-POSITIVE 3.7.1. HIV-positive prior to initiation of PrEP Clients who test HIV-positive must be offered ART as soon as possible, regardless of CD4 count. They must be linked to HIV care, treatment, and support. Where possible, their partner s should be encouraged to test for HIV. 3.7.2. HIV-positive after initiation of PrEP HIV seroc onversion after initiating PrEP can occur, and may be due to non-adherence or being in the window period at the time of testing . As soon as a n HIV-positive test has been confirmed ART should be immediately initiated , using first-line regimen s, and the client must be linked to HIV care and treatment. Resistance testing , or use of second -line regimens , is not recommended , as of seroconverters who have rece ived PrEP may h ave resistance to FTC or TDF. 3.8. PREP FOLLOW UP AND MONITORING TABLE 3. PREP FOLLOW UP AND MONITORING Activity Following PrEP Initiation Confirmation of HIV -negative s tatus At 1 month, then every 3 months Address side effects Every visit Adherence counselling Every visit Creatinine clearance test At 1 month, then every 3 months for the first year, Males initiating PrEP need 7 days of daily dosing to reach adequate anal/rectal tissue levels, while females need up to 20 days of daily dosing to achieve protective vaginal tissue levels of PrEP drugs. During this period, other protective precautions preferably should be used, such as abstinence or condoms. Major side effects: renal toxicity and metabolic complications (decreased bone mineral density, which is re versible in adults upon stopping PrEP), extremely small risk of lactic acidosis and steatohepatitis (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and flatulence), which are self -limiting and typically end w ithin first month of use; unintentional weight loss Less predictable side effects: hypersensitivity reactions and flares of hepatitis B in those who are chronic carriers if they stop TDF/FTC Final Draft - 11 May 2016 14 then annually2 STI screening and treatment Every visit PrEP medication issuance 1 month supply, then 3 monthly supply Behavioural sexual risk reduction counselling Every visit 3.9. RISK REDUCTION COUNSELLING Risk-reduction counselling is a behavioural intervention that attempts to decrease an individual's chances of acquiring HIV and other STIs39, and should be implemented together with HIV prevention counselling and sexual reproductive health and contraceptive counselling at all follow -up visits for PrEP users. The main objective of risk -reduction coun selling is for clients to assess individual risk and set realistic goal s for behaviour change that could reduce their risk of contracting HIV and other STIs, as well as reduce unwanted pregnancies. This is most effective when it is non - prejudicial and user -centred. Risk reduction counselling can be provided by any trained healthcare provider and should address the following points: Explore the context of the client's specific sexual practices and psychosocial status , and assist client to recognise which of their behaviours are associated with higher risks for HIV infection. Healthcare providers should also be aware that clients might not always perceive their own risk, or be in denial about it. Identify the sexual health protection needs of the potential PrEP user and reflect on what their main conc erns appear to be. Strategis e with the client on how they can manage these concerns or needs. Agree on which strategies the client is willing to explore and guide them to decide on how to implement the strategy. 3.10. DISCONTINUATION OF PREP PrEP should be stopped if the client : Has a positive HIV test Develops renal disease Is non -adherent to PrEP Does not need or want PrEP No longer meets eligibility criteria If there are s afety concerns where the r isks of PrEP use outweigh potential benefits The duration of PrEP use may vary and individuals are likely to start and stop PrEP depending on their risk assessment at different periods in their lives. Because PrEP is user driven, users should be given information on the correct way to stop PrEP to en sure effectiveness. For users who want to stop PrEP they should do so after consultation with the 2 The TAPS program will implement creatinine testing every 6 months . This additional data may provide evidence which will allow for updating the guidelines in the future. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 15 health care provider. PrEP medication should be continued for 28 days after the last potential HIV exposure to ensure coverage and protection . 3.11. REDUCING THE RISK OF ANTIRETROVIRAL RESISTANCE To minimise the risks of developing ARV resistance , HIV testing must be done every three months, with a symptom screen and a targeted examination to exclude acute HIV infection . HIV testing should also be repeated wheneve r symptoms of a viral illness are present. BOX 5. RESISTANCE RISK REDUCTION 3.12. HEPATITIS B MANAGEMENT TDF and FTC both have hepatitis B antiviral activity. The potent ial risk exists that exposure to these antivirals may treat unidentified chronic hepatitis B infection with a consequent viral flare (rebound) upon drug withdrawal that can result in a liver injury40. To avoid this risk, screening for hepatitis B surface a ntigen and antibodies occurs prior to PrEP commencement. If hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is positive, the user should be investigated prior to commencement of short -term PrEP. PrEP is not contra -indicated in those with HBV but liver function monit oring should be performed. PrEP users with persistently elevated or abnormal liver function tests should be referred for assessment. Liver function tests should be checked after stopping PrEP in those with chronic hepatitis B infection. People with chroni c hepatitis B infection may choose to continue using tenofovir to control their hepatitis, even if they do not require these drugs any longer for the indication of PrEP. Users with a history of injecting drug use should be screened for hepatitis C and, if positive, referred for further care. TABLE 4.

PREP AND T&T SCREENING AND INITIATION ALGORITHM Final Draft - 11 May 2016 17 4. Service Delivery Guidance 4.1. CAPACITY BUILDING OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS The National Department of Health Operational Guidelines for HIV, STI, and TB Programmes for Key Populations in South Africa41 acknowledge s the need for health care provider sensitis ation training in order to better support public health care services and adolescent friendly services for priority populations. In the context of PrEP and T&T sex worker progra mmes, healthcare provider sensitis ation training may promote stronger uptake and retention in care by creating a non -stigmatis ing and supportive space for delivery of PrEP and T&T in the sex worker population. All healthcare providers involved in the provision of PrEP and ART services should be involved in such training , including doctors, clinical nurse practitioners, staff n urses, counsellors , pharmacists, pharmacy assistants, o utreach w orkers, other health care providers , and peer supporters. In addition to sensitivity and competency training for sex workers , all healthcare providers affiliated with PrEP and ART service delivery should complete a PrEP and T&T implementation traini ng programme , including clinical management, adherence, combination prevention, and risk reduction counselling . 4.2. FOLLOW UP AND RETENTION IN PREP After clients have been initiated onto PrEP, the core focus of the service provider should be on supporting retention and maintaining adherence among those using PrEP. For populations at substantial risk, there are important considerations that can affect their ability to be retained. Str ategies for supporting follow up and retention are discussed in Box 6 below. 4.2.1. Provide ongoing counselling and education At each follow up visit, providers should assess if the use of PrEP has changed for their client and t he effect this may have on the effectiveness of PrEP. Providers should support the client to identify strategies for improving adherence, which take into consideration the clients' individual barriers and facilitators. Adherence counselling should be clien t-centred. Barriers and facilitators to adherence should be identified by the client and not prescribed by the provider. Ongoing education and counselling should then be provided to the client at each PrEP -related visit. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 18 BOX 6. STRATEGIES FOR SUPPORTING PREP ADHERENCE 4.2.2. Promote client retention a nd follow -up Individuals may face challenges in attending regular follow -up visits required for PrEP services. Strategies should be used to address the specific challenges faced by individuals to support retention in PrEP services and adherence to PrEP. For example, sex worker populations may be highly mobile , may not consistently visit the same clinic or service provider over an extended period of time , and may find it difficult to attend clinic services during regular office hours. BOX 7. STRAT EGIES FOR SUPPORTING RETENTION AND COMMUNICATION 4.3. MONITORING AND EVALU ATION OF CLINICAL PREP PROVISION Initial PrEP program mes should be accompanied by significant monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plans to measure program me roll-out and the success of various implementation approaches , and also to capture lessons learned on the many unanswered questions regarding the best methods for screening and initiating clients and client monitoring (refer to the PrEP and T&T implementation plan). Schedule medication taking time to correspond with the users daily routine activities Use reminders e.g. cell phone, alarms, beepers, calendars Use of pillbox es Review disclosure issues to identify those who can support the user's intentions to adhere or barriers to adherence due to lack of disclosure/privacy at home Join an on -line support group e.g. Facebook: PrEP Rethinking HIV Prevention or #wethebrave Use alternative methods of communication: SMS, social networking, mobile applications Integrat e mobile services and outreach into existing services Enhance peer support strategies , such as the use of clubs Provide alternative clinic hours, if possible Collect additional contact information for each client Provide clients in advance with referral partners in the event that they migrate, or provide with additional stock/prescription Final Draft - 11 May 2016 19 5. About the Development of the PrEP and T est & Treat Guidelines On 23 October 2015, a meeting was held at the National Department of Health to discuss the programmatic implications for adopting and implementing the new WHO guidelines for Test and Treat ( T&T) and HIV Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). During that meeting it was decided that a core group of experts would convene to review evidence, programmatic implications, and develop national guidelines for PrEP. The core group met on 23 -24 November 2015 to prepare the draft PrEP guidelines. The South ern Africa HIV Cli nicians Society PrEP guidelines were used as the basis of the clinical section. The draft guidelines were shared with the expert community on 15 December 2015. Comments were incorporated and a revis ed version was shared with Dr Pillay. Upon receipt of commen ts from Dr Pillay, and recognis ing a number of outstanding issues still needed to be addressed, a third meeting with a larger group of experts and representatives from the South Africa HIV program me community was held on 13 J anuary 2016 at the National Department of Health. Based on the outcome of the January meeting , a revised v ersio n of guidelines, as well as a draft policy , was shared with the larger group for comment in early February. Feedback was incorporated and the r evised guidelines and policy were discussed with the larger technical working group members in a meeting on 25 February 2016. In coordination with the launching of the South African National Sex Worker HIV Plan on 11 March 2016, a revised version of the PrEP and Test and Treat guidelines were developed , which focused on the provision of PrEP and T&T services, in the context of combination prevention and expanded treatment, for the sex worker population. The new, focused guidelines were shared with the exp ert group and discussed at a NDOH meeting, chaired by Dr Pillay, on 10 March 2016. Final Draft - 11 May 2016 20 6. Appendixes Appendix 1.
