Chiropractic is a health care profession that focuses on the relationship between the body's structure\u2014mainly the spine\u2014and its functioning. Although chiropractors may use a variety of treatment approaches, they primarily perform adjustments (manipulations) to the spine or other parts of the body with the goal of correcting alignment problems, alleviating pain, improving function, and supporting the body's natural ability to heal itself. During the initial visit, chiropractors typically take a health history and perform a physical examination, with a special emphasis on the spine. Other examinations or tests such as x-rays may also be performed. If chiropractic treatment is considered appropriate, a treatment plan will be developed. Chiropractic Acupuncture Acupuncture therapy works by inserting very thin needles on the skin to hit the acupuncture points in the body to restore the balance between the yin and yang of a person's life force (called \"Qi\" but read as \"chi\"). However, in today's practice, acupuncture is just a therapy to stimulate the sensory nerves under the skin using very thin needles. The stimulation of the sensory nerves affects the pain processing of the nervous system and the muscles. This also improves blood flow to the different parts of the body. Wellness Once your body has fully healed, it is important to come in for periodic adjustments to avoid problems in the future. Recovering from an injury is much harder than preventing one. Usually, wellness/recovery care equates to coming in one to four times per month, based on your lifestyle and goals to stay healthy and maintain spinal mobility.
