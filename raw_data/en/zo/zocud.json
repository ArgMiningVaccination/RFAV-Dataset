Provider Details Dr. Steve Sterling L.AC.'s Expert Contributions [What is acupuncture and how does it help?](https://www.findatopdoc.com/Questions/what-is-acupuncture-and-how-does-it-help2) Acupuncture is the gentle insertion of very fine needles into specific points on the body. This process stimulates movement of energy within the body, allowing natural healing to take place. These points are selected based on years of training acupuncturists receive based on over 5,000 years of experience in China. Acupuncture helps to prevent illness by improving the overall functioning of the body's immune and organ systems. Acupuncture is helpful for: Treating existing illnesses and injuries. Preventing both recurrence of illnesses and new illness. Improving overall health. Acupuncture originated in China over 5,000 years ago. It is part of the holistic system of healing known as Traditional Chinese Medicine (\"TCM\"). How does Acupuncture work? Traditional Chinese Medicine Theory The Classical Chinese explanation is that energy (Qi) flows in channels (meridians) throughout the body and over its surfaces. These channels are rivers of energy which are referred to as meridians. The Chinese have identified 71 meridians in the human body, which is a basic energy map for all people. The meridians are often compared to a series of interconnected highways. Each of the major organs in the body is associated with its own meridian. Through the network of meridians the internal organs are connected to certain areas and parts of the body including the muscles, bones, joints, and also other organs. The Chinese believe that health is a manifestation of balance, both within the body itself and between the body and the external environment. When the body is internally balanced and in harmony with the external environment, Qi flows smoothly through the meridians to nourish the organs and tissues. If an obstruction occurs in one of the meridians, the Qi is disrupted and cannot flow properly. When the Qi cannot flow smoothly or is forced to flow in the opposite direction, the body's innate balance is disrupted and illness results. Acupuncture points are the specific points on the meridians where the Qi is both concentrated and accessible. Acupuncture engages the Qi by inserting needles at these specific points, the goal being to restore the proper flow of Qi. As the body regains its natural balance, well-being returns. Acupuncture and Modern Science To the human body, acupuncture needles are a physical stimulus. In Western science, a stimulus is defined as a detectable change in either the external environment or within the body itself. When the body detects change, it produces a response. Although acupuncture is not yet fully understood by Western science, with modern technology scientists can now actually begin to \"see\" the body's response to acupuncture. For example, using an MRI (a very sophisticated x-ray), researchers have shown that when a needle is inserted at specific acupuncture points on the body, corresponding changes occur in the brain. In the West, acupuncture is most well-known for its ability to relieve pain so the majority of research thus far has been done in this area. Acupuncture points are now believed to stimulate the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) to release pain-relieving chemicals into the muscles, spinal cord and brain. Acupuncture may also stimulate other chemicals to be released by the brain, including hormones that influence the self-regulating system of the body. Summary Chinese Oriental medicine has been around for thousands of years, and has provided us with a unique and holistic approach to help prevent and treat disease. Western science and Traditional Chinese Medicine ultimately rely on the body's natural healing ability to maintain health and protect against disease. Both have the same goal of helping a person stay healthy. Western science tends to use drugs and surgery as needed. Acupuncturists tend to use gentle needling and herbs. A combination of both systems creates an ideal environment of health and healing.

Actually, you can pretty much do things as normal the things that you want to avoid is getting into water or in the rain, taking a bath or a shower for a at least a few hours. This is because the energy pathways may still be open and you want to avoid getting dampness in them. Also, avoid extreme temperatures too hot or too cold, warmth is better because it helps to make it easier for your body to keep yourself warm so that you don't use as much energy. Avoid caffeine & alcohol because these can be a diuretic by making you pee which can pull water out of your body and can cause you to become dehydrated. Refrain from recreational drugs. Avoid working out or doing anything too strenuous because this can undo the benefits of the acupuncture treatment. Skip the workout that day and you can pick up where you left off on the following day. Better to pee before your treatment then immediately right after but, the general rule of thumb is eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired, and drink when you're thirsty. Try not to go too long if your body is asking you for these things. [READ MORE](https://www.findatopdoc.com/Questions/what-should-you-do-after-an-acupuncture-session) [Should I drink water after acupuncture?](https://www.findatopdoc.com/Questions/should-I-drink-water-after-acupuncture) Everyone is an individual and rarely are their absolute advice that applies generically for everyone. That being said, ideally you should be adequately hydrated prior to your acupuncture treatment and void your bladder if necessary before you get acupuncture treatment. This is to avoid the need to have to go to the bathroom while you are laying there receiving the treatment. Traditionally, one should avoid being exposed to water as in don't take a shower, go out without protective wear in the rain, or stand in the water for about an hour after you receive your acupuncture treatment. This is based on the concept that your energy pathways called meridians may have been opened during the treatment and you will want to protect them from getting dampness lodged into your meridians. There isn't any contraindication that I am aware of for drinking water after a treatment however, the treatment is working with your body and its energy \"Qi\" system and you may probably not want to alter your body's composition by drinking or eating anything right after the treatment but, you also don't want to be too thirsty or hungry before your treatment. In Chinese medicine the general rule of thumb is eat when you are hungry, drink when you are thirsty, and sleep when you are tired. But, this is based on someone being in good moderation and able to listen to their body's inner wisdom and not react to sugar cravings, or overindulgences, etc. I hope this is helpful.

Heartburn Prevacid, and Zegerid inhibitors (PPIs) and are among the highest-selling classes of drugs in the U.S. with $9 Billion in sales last year. Prilosec (omeprazole) is the 6th most commonly prescribed drug with 53.4 prescriptions sold. The theory was that heartburn was caused by too much acid and so these drugs are designed to block the stomach's ability to produce acid. WHAT CAUSES HEARTBURN? As we age stomach acid production decreases. The stomach acid needs to be very acidic pH 3 in order for the stomach contents to empty into the small intestine where it mixes with the digestive juices from the pancreas. With less stomach acid this means that it takes longer for food to digest in the stomach. What happens to food when it gets left out too long on the counter, it spoils. The same thing happens to food when it sits too long in your stomach. Protein putrefy, Carbohydrates ferment, and Fats become rancid. When this happens this produces gas and the gas has to go someplace so when it goes up and pushes open on the valve to the esophagus it splashes some of the stomach acid onto the walls of the esophagus causing heartburn. If you have heartburn or take antacids or PPIs you may benefit from stomach acid supplementation. (Remember to consult your doctor before going off any prescription medications). But, before taking STOMACH ACID SUPPLEMENTATION with SP-zypan consider doing the apple cider vinegar test! APPLE CIDER VINEGAR TEST - to help check for an ulcer Drink 1 Tbs of apple cider vinegar in 4 oz of water on an empty stomach. If you have increased burning symptoms you should consult your primary doctor to rule out an ulcer and you should not supplement stomach acid. Stomach acid is your body's first line of defense against foreign pathogens (bacteria, virus, & parasites). If your stomach acid is low opportunistic bacteria such as h.pylori (helicobacter pylori) can take up residence in your stomach or small intestine. This can produce an inflammatory response which can cause other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions to flare-up. The test and treatment protocol for h. pylori are available here at our integrative wellness center. We have Leaky gut testing and parasite stool testing. FIRST PLACE TO START Start now by scheduling your online or phone nutritional consultation and complete the Symptom Survey Form. https://weblac.samcart.com/produc.../nutritional-consultation/ STOMACH ACID IS IMPORTANT FOR BRAIN FUNCTION Adequate stomach acid is needed for the stomach intrinsic factor used so your body can absorb Vit B12. Vit B12 is also cofactor which acts as an enzyme to catalyze many important biochemical reactions including how the cells make energy and it is important for making brain chemicals (neurotransmitters). Vit B12 (Methylcobalamin)in the Liver detoxification process is important because it donates a methyl group to toxins so that they can be eliminated in the urine. It is estimated that as many as 60% of the U.S. population has a variation in the gene for MTHFR (Methyl Tetra Hydro Folate Reductase). Having a variation means that you don't methylate as well and that you could have a higher requirement for Vit B12 supplementation. Be sure to get the Methylcobalamin B12 (and not the cyanocobalamin). We offer DNA testing and Vitamin & Mineral nutritional testing. At WebLAc.com I offer a variety of testing to determine if your body is functioning optimally or if you have inadequate digestion. \"My motto is if we're not testing we're guessing and I don't want to guess with your health\". We also carry many natural professional products as well as traditional Chinese herbal medicine to help restore your body's healthy balance. Once the underlying functional imbalance is restored than the symptoms go away because we fixed the problem. Your body is amazing and it has the ability to heal itself as long as we give it what it needs.
