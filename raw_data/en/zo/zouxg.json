The [1996 Heisman Trophy winner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Wuerffel) was one of the all-time great college quarterbacks, leading the Gators to 4 SEC championships in 4 years, and the 1996 national championship. His NFL career was less successful, however--just 10 starts and 2100 passing yards over 6 seasons--and he retired from the game in 2002. Since then, he has worked at a [small faith-based non-profit](http://www.desirestreet.org/templates/default.asp?id=43731&) that works throughout the southern United States. After recovering from a stomach virus contracted during one of the non-profit's retreats, he began to lose feeling and strength in his arms and legs. Fortunately, because the disease was caught early, a full recovery is more likely. Nevertheless, because of its debilitating effects, GBS is still a serious disorder, and, because it is normally triggered by an infection, some people have wondered: can a vaccine (which often consists of a weakened form of an infection) cause GBS? Those fears were given some legitimacy in 1976, when a swine flu vaccine had [an increased risk of GBS of 1 in every 100,000 people](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/guillainbarre.htm). [A 2003 CDC review of the data](http://www.cim.umfcluj.ro/Gripa%20A/Surse/Guillain-Barre%20Syndrome%20Folowing%20Influenza%20Vaccination.pdf) confirmed this increased risk, but, importantly, stopped short of fingering flu vaccines in general as the cause. Since then, no other studies have shown a connection between flu vaccines and increased risk of GBS. Earlier this year, a study of the side effects of the H1N1 vaccine given to 90 million Chinese in 2009 and 2010 [found no increase in the rate of GBS diagnoses](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/69491/title/No_flu_vaccine_link_to_Guillain-Barr%C3%A9_syndrome_found_). Experts remain unsure why the 1976 vaccine saw an increase in risk of GBS, but it seems less and less likely that the vaccine itself was to blame. "}
