Whether it is the students who just donned their white coats for the first time on Founders' Day, or those whose white coats have seen many years of wear, our commu-nity is ready to buckle in \u2014 ready to learn, to discover, to grow. T his magnificent ride would not be possible without our incredible faculty. Individually, their discoveries are game- changing, their work lifesaving, their men- torship transformative. But as a connected network of collaborators, innovators, dreamers, and doers, their collective contri- bution to science, education, and medicine is simply staggering. T he school now counts 2,063 faculty in regular tracks: 1,616 clinician-educators, 372 investigators, and 75 team-scientists. Another 2,233 practice medicine, teach students, or conduct research in various contributing tracks. On e of the faculty's core functions is to educate and, when combining medical students, fellows, residents, and other trainees in the various top-tier programs we offer, that means educating more than 3,500 healthcare professionals and sci- entists of tomorrow. This is no small feat, and our faculty is more than meeting the A Focus on Faculty challenge. T eaching evaluations are high and student outcomes excellent: Our medical students achieve United States Medical Licensing Examination scores well above the national mean, and the majority match into T op 25 institutions for residency. Last year's Association of American Medical Colleges Graduation Questionnaire, com- pleted by medical students in the Class of 2021, reported 96 percent satisfaction with their education, putting us above the 80th percentile nationally. T here is yet more to commend, as our faculty members' work extends far beyond the classroom. Thanks to Feinberg's extraor - dinary roster of clinician-educators, team scientists, and investigators, in the past decade, our total research portfolio has grown 94 percent from $315 million per year to $610 million per year. A s I reflect on these astounding figures, I think of the steady build this sort of prog- ress requires, and the rock-solid foundation our predecessors laid for us to be able to arrive at this point. In this issue, we honor a revered faculty member and leader dear to so many, who recently passed away: Lewis Landsberg, MD, whose endowed title I proudly carry. Here is a man who reflected every attribute to which we aspire as faculty and, moreover, as humans striving to make an impact on our world. Please read more about him, along with other cherished members of the Northwestern community who have passed, on page 36. Als o in this issue, you will once again find stories of our dedicated faculty, such as D. James Surmeier, PhD, chair and Nathan Smith Davis Professor of Neuroscience, who is the winner of the 2021 Tripartite Legacy Faculty Prize in Translational Science and Education. This honor is presented annually to a faculty member who has demonstrated excellence in research that emphasizes translational approaches, teaching and mentoring, and leadership \u2014 a trifecta of immense contribution. Y ou will also learn more about Kristi Holmes, PhD, director of the Galter Health Sciences Library, who has put Galter on the national and international stage for bio- informatics and data science, and William Muller, MD, PhD, the Janardan K. Reddy, MD Professor of Pathology, who for three decades has been tenaciously studying the body's inflammatory response as a pathway to treating disease. P erhaps the most telling example of our exemplary faculty can be found on page 7, where you can read about the 23 faculty recently appointed with endowed professor - ships \u2014 the highest honor a university can bestow upon its faculty. The medical school currently has more than 200 endowed professorship positions, and we could not be prouder of these distinguished individuals. O f course, the beauty of higher educa- tion is that it is a continuum, and everyone \u2014 no matter where they are on their academic journey \u2014 is valued and valuable. Here's to the many working at every level and in various capacities to make our medical school extraordinary. Past, present, and future, the impact of our people is felt near and far.

The celebration, held on August 6, honors Feinberg's founders and marks the official start of the academic year. M ensah was one of 1 62 new members of the Class of 2025, who celebrated the occasion with their families, along with the second-year medical students who presented the incoming class with their white coats. Because last year's Founders' Day event was cancelled due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, the Class of 2024 was also honored and given a chance to put on their white coats for the first time together. \"W e are delighted to have so many family and friends here to welcome a talented group of new students who will help write the next \"ICelebrating Founders' Day 2021 chapter in the story of Feinberg,\" said Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for Medical Affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean. \"Founders' Day has been a tradition here at the medical school since 1922. It is the traditional start of our new academic year; it is also a new beginning for our students on a path that will lead them into careers of life-long responsibility.\" N eilson highlighted Feinberg's distin- guished history of training outstanding physi- cians, including Daniel Hale Williams, part of the Class of 1 883, who performed the first successful pericardial repair in America and was the only Black charter member of the American College of Surgeons, Mary Harris Thompson, the first female graduate of Feinberg in 1 870 and the first female surgeon in Chicago, and Charles Horace Mayo, who graduated in 1 888 and returned to Minnesota to join his father and brother in founding the Mayo Clinic. While academic and pr ofessional accom- plishments are important, the heart of practic- ing medicine remains the same since Feinberg was founded in 1 859: caring for patients.CHERYL MENSAH\"I feel very humbled \u2014 you grow up and see so many people who are important wearing this coat \u2014 and I'm hoping I can make a difference in patients' lives.\" A first-year medical student5 MAGAZINE.NM.ORG MAX WILBERDING A first-year medical student \" An obligation to serve patients to the best of your ability, no matter the circumstance, is at the very core of our profession,\" Neilson said. K athleen Hagerty, PhD, MBA, provost of Northwestern University also welcomed the incoming class. \"During this er a, against the backdrop of a global pandemic, we have witnessed the critical importance of scientific discovery and com- passionate care, around the world, and here in Chicago,\" Hagerty said. \"You have chosen the very best place to learn these critical aspects of medicine, as you embark on the next chapter of your educational journey.\" The F ounders' Day address was delivered by Dinee Simpson, MD, assistant professor of Surgery in the Division of Organ Transplantation and director of the African American Transplant Access Program (AATAP). \"Y ou are in a position to influence so much more than the diagnosis and treatment plan,\" Simpson said. \"The power of being seen speaks to the power of community, and your most powerful moments as physicians are not just as clinicians, but as representatives, advocates, and allies for our patients.\" T o close out the ceremony, Marianne Green, MD, the Raymond H. Curry, MD, Professor of Medical Education and vice dean for education, led the white coat ceremony for both second- and first-year students. Even though second-year students had been wearing their coats for a year, the moment was nevertheless impactful, accord- ing to Alan Soetikno, a second-year student. \" Our first year of medical school was tough because of COVID,\" Soetikno said. \"But putting on the coats together, that was a special feeling.\" N ext, the first-year students donned their white coats, a lifelong dream for students includ- ing Max Wilberding, a first-year student from a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio. \"I 've wanted to be a doctor as long as I can remember,\" said Wilberding. \"I saw all the faculty, family, and fellow students cheering us on \u2014 I know we can do this if we do it together.\" Clad in whit e, the first-year students recited the Declaration of Geneva, the modern incarnation of the historic Hippocratic Oath. The oath, representing a lifelong commitment to caring for others, was a surreal experi- ence for Luis Rivas, a first-year student from Chicago who has spent the last four years working as an emergency medical technician and teaching with Teach For America. \" There were times when I thought maybe I wasn't cut out for medicine,\" Rivas said. \"But when I put on the coat and recited the oath, it made me realize that I'm here. I'm getting another chance to stretch my wings, explore academic medicine, and become a physician.\"\"I've wanted to be a doctor for as long as I can remember. I know we can do this if we do it together.\"6 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021PULSE On Campushysician-scientists at the beginning of their research careers often face a predicament: Securing grants to conduct research requires research experience and mentorship.

WRITTEN BY Nora DunneHonoring Faculty Excellence n September 20, 2021 , Feinberg cele- brated 23 faculty recently appointed with endowed professorships during a group investiture ceremony at The Peninsula Hotel in downtown Chicago. Pr ofessorships represent the highest honor a university can bestow upon its faculty. These academic accolades help Feinberg recog - nize its most distinguished and productive phy - sicians and scientists and continue to recruit and retain leaders in medicine. The medical school currently has more than 200 endowed professorship positions. \" At Feinberg, our faculty are the single most important resource for advancing the medical school's research, education, and clinical service,\" said Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for medical affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean, during his opening remarks. \"Our shared success depends on the intellec- tual environment created by a superb and Ocommitted faculty. For this reason, the creation of named and endowed professorships at the medical school is enormously important.\" All of the medical schoo l's 23 new pro- fessorships were created from donor funds. Endowments established by committed philan- thropists create reliable, long-term support for faculty to initiate pioneering research, develop stronger teaching programs, invest in new tech- nologies, and maintain laboratories and other physical assets. \" Thanks to generous medical school donors who support endowed professorships, our numbers continue to grow, aiding us in our endeavors to double Feinberg's research enter - prise and continue our trajectory to the very top of academic medicine,\" Neilson said. S everal of the faculty members honored at the event were appointed to their professorships in late 201 9 and 2020, but their celebrations were put on hold due to the COVID- 19 pandemic.

RESEARCH BRIEFS Northwestern Medicine scientists have developed an antibody that they believe can be used to treat muscular dystrophy, according to a study published in Science Translational Medicine. \"W e believe this can become a therapy for muscular dystrophy, including the many different forms of muscular dystrophy,\" said senior study author Elizabeth McNally, MD, PhD, director of the Center for Genetic Medicine and the Elizabeth J. Ward Professor of Genetic Medicine. \"Given the success with so many other antibodies in treating chronic human dis-eases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, we are very optimistic this antibody can translate into the human disease setting.\" T he antibody targets the TGF-beta pathway, a pathway known to be important for regulating scarring (fibrosis). In muscular dys- trophy, the muscles become scarred over time, and this antibody helps reduce scarring in the muscles. With this treatment the muscles also became stronger. T he target protein in this case binds the three major forms of TGF-beta, which makes it more effective than other ap-proaches that target single forms of TGF-beta. Many scientists have tried to target TGF-beta to treat disease, but it has been difficult to do this successfully because of the multiple forms and their complicated pathway of action. The team made an antibody to the protein that binds all three forms of TGF-beta and stabilizes these proteins so they cannot become active. T oo much TGF-beta activity is a major contributor to scarring and muscle weakness in muscular dystrophy. N ormally, PD1 codes for a receptor that acts as a check on T-cell activity to prevent over-activity and autoimmunity. Some immuno- therapies suppress the PD1 receptor to unleash the body's immune system against cancer, but this study demonstrates that cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) may be a poor candidate for this type of immunotherapy, according to Jaehyuk Choi, MD, PhD, the Ruth K. Freinkel, MD, research professor and senior author of the study. The study used mor e than 300 samples of CTCL from a diverse array of patients, includ- ing different subtypes, stages and outcomes. Using unbiased whole genome sequencing, the investigators found 86 putative driver genes and unexpectedly, one gene had a much stronger GENE IMPLICATED IN POOR SKIN CANCER THERAPY OUTCOMESDISEASE DISCOVERIES New Hope for Antibody to Treat Muscular DystrophyDISEASE DISCOVERIESThis study was supported by National Institutes of 01A1,1DP2AI136599-01, T32 CA009560, K08 AR072791 and P30 AR070253; the Skin Cancer Foundation, the Leukemia Research Foundation, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, Damon Runyon Foundation grants DRCRF# CI-84-16, DDCF# 2016095 and Award; and research grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. association with worse outcomes than the rest: PD1. \"W e thought each gene would subtly be a driver of disease phenotype, so we were shocked when one gene seemed to explain the difference between very aggressive and less- aggressive cancer,\" Choi said. While the e xact mechanism requires further study, Choi said this phenomenon made sense: In other cancers, suppressing PD1 helps recruit more T-cells to fight cancer. But when the cancer arises from T-cells \u2014 as is the case in CTCL \u2014 shutting down a vital check on T-cell recruitment can fuel the cancer further.Immunohistochemistry staining showing PD1 expression on tumor cells in a skin biopsy from a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patient.

The study , published in the Journal of Cell Biology , was led by Jeffrey Savas, PhD, assistant professor in the Ken & Ruth Davee Department of Neurology's Division of Behavioral Neurology, of Medicine the in Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, and of Pharmacology. Pr evious work led by Savas discovered that nuclear pore complex proteins in post-mitotic neurons are exceptionally long- lived and persist for months in mouse and rat brains. These proteins, termed long-lived proteins, or LLPs, provide long-term stability and structure to the nuclear pore and subsequently to the nuclear envelope of neurons; however, this concept had never been considered for other intracellular organelles, until now. F or example, proper functioning of mito- chondria \u2014 organelles responsible for energy pro-duction within the cell \u2014 was previously thought to rely on protein renewal. However, in the current study, the scientists used isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to discover that a subset of mitochondrial proteins were long-lived in tissues enriched in post-mitotic cells, including brain and heart cells. These proteins concentrated in a sub-compartment of mitochondria called cristae, highly structured folds within the mitochondrial inner membrane that are essential for cellular respiration and homeostasis. \" The identification of long-lived proteins in mitochondria is important and quite unexpected, as it counteracts the central idea of mitochondria being these dynamic organelles that are constantly being turned over and replaced,\" Savas said. INVESTIGATING LONG- LIVED MITOCHONDRIAL PROTEINSSCIENTIFIC ADVANCES A novel combination treatment may increase the ability of monoclonal antibodies to control viral infection in patients diagnosed with HIV, according to a Northwestern Medicine study published in Science Translational Medicine. \"T his really demonstrates that we should combine broadly neutralizing antibodies with other immunostimulatory agents, especially those that may impact immune response. If we want to use broadly neutralizing antibodies to cure, we need to find the right combination,\" said Elena Martinelli, PhD, MPH, research pro-fessor of Cell and Developmental Biology and senior author of the study. Ne utralizing antibodies, a key com- ponent of the body's adaptive immune response in fighting against viruses and other pathogens, bind to the surface of infected cells and inhibit them from interacting with and infecting healthy host cells. Previous research has shown that these broadly neutralizing antibodies can promote the body's immune re- sponse, specifically by increasing T-cell and antibody responses in patients diagnosed with HIV. A dditionally, past research efforts led by Martinelli discovered that cells that express the cellular receptor Integrin alpha 4 beta 7 are more com- monly infected by HIV and promote pathogenesis. Understanding exactly how an individual's immune response reacts in the presence of neutralizing antibodies is essential to developing novel therapeutic interventions for treating HIV, according to Martinelli.Combination Treatment May Prolong HIV Viral SuppressionCLINICAL BREAKTHROUGHS This work was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke grant F32 NS106812 and R21NS107761, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development grant R21HD098498, and National Institute of Aging grant R01AG061787.This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grant R01AI098546-06. \" TH IS REALLY DEMONSTRATES THAT WE SHOULD COMBINE BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES WITH OTHER IMMUNOSTIMULATORY AGENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT MAY IMPACT IMMUNE RESPONSE.\"Research Briefs 10 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021PULSEMigrating cells use stiffened micro- tubules to push through tissue barriers, seeking out weak points in tissue, according to a Northwestern Medicine study published in Cell Reports. These findings shed light on the specific role of microtubules in cell migration, accord- ing to Brian Mitchell, PhD, associate professor of Cell and Developmental Biology and senior author of the study. \"Micr otubules are very dynamic, constantly growing and shrinking, but this process stabi- lizes them so they're more resistant to strain and gives cells the strength to poke through tissue,\" said Mitchell, who is also a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. C ell migration is fundamental to maintain- ing the proper organization of cells within the body. During development, large-scale migrations help build the central nervous system. In adult organisms, cell migration is essential for immune response, wound repair and tissue homeostasis. Pr evious studies have outlined microtu- bules' role in aiding cell migration, according to Mitchell. In the current study, Mitchell and his collaborators measured the penetrative ability of cells in which they both positively and negatively modulated tubulin acetylation, finding that cells with more acetylation improved their ability to penetrate tissue. Cells with more acetylated microtubules are both faster at penetrating through the tissue and less picky about where they penetrate, according to Mitchell. This work was supported by National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant R01GM119322. STRENGTHENED MICROTUBULES AID CELL MIGRATIONSCIENTIFIC ADVANCES Women with early, nonviable pregnancies of unknown loca- tion who were given an active management strategy had more successful pregnancy resolutions than those given an expectant management strategy, according to a recent clinical trial published in JAMA. T he findings provide essential data for fertility clinicians to better guide their patients when making informed choices about their pregnancies, according to Emily Jungheim, MD, the Edmond Confino, MD, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a co-author of the study. \"W hen it comes to pregnancy and women's health, we really are trying to get to a place where we can be more patient-centered, and I think this particular study is in that spirit. It provides us more information to help educate our patients when they're faced with these tough decisions of what makes the most sense for them,\" said Jungheim, who is also chief of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. O verall, women who received active management compared to those who received expectant management more fre- quently experienced a successful resolution of their pregnancy, with 51 percent versus 36 percent, respectively. The study demon- strates a shift in reproductive medicine becoming more patient-centered, according to Jungheim, adding that the present data will be essential for healthcare providers to better educate and guide patients.Supporting Women with Early Nonviable PregnanciesCLINICAL BREAKTHROUGHS This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. WOMEN WHO RECEIVED ACTIVE MANAGEMENT MORE FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCED A SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION OF THEIR PREGNANCY.Research Briefs Northwestern Medicine scientists have identified a critical check - point in transcription elongation, the process of synthesizing RNA from a DNA template, according to findings published in Molecular Cell. A ccording to the study, the presence of a protein called SPT5 serves as a \"passport,\" determining whether a polymerase complex is allowed to proceed down the length of DNA or is instead degraded and destroyed. \" Only RNA Polymerase IIs with SPT5 are allowed to leave the station,\" said Ali Shilatifard, PhD, the Robert Francis Furchgott Professor, chair of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, and senior author of the study. Man y molecular biology experi- ments operate by deleting a gene, or the protein that gene codes for, and observing the impact, which suggests the function of that gene.

American adults ar e diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at an average age of 50 years old, but the 3,022-participant study found the average age at diagnosis was four to seven years earlier in non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American adults compared with non-Hispanic white adults. More than 25 percent of non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American adults with diabetes reported a diagnosis before turning 40.

While acute inflamma- tion has evolved as the immune system's first response to protect the body, chronic inflammation can cause extensive and potentially irreversible damage, as commonly seen in autoimmune diseases or chronic inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and atherosclerosis. Regulating inflammation \u2014 ensuring that the body doesn't generate too much of a good thing \u2014 is a flourishing area of study at Northwestern. P erhaps one of the biggest hubs of activity in this area is the lab of William Muller, MD, PhD, the Janardan K. Reddy, MD Professor of Pathology. Muller has been studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the body's inflammatory response in the hope of discovering a more selec-tive approach to treat disease for more than three decades. His lab's inflammatory models include atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, dermatitis, and more. \" Simply put, inflammation is at the root of all pathology,\" he argues. \"Once I realized that chronic inflammation becomes the disease instead of the way to eliminate the disease, I thought it was essential to learn how to regulate inflammation.\" W hile Muller has studied a broad scope of diseases over the course of his long career, investigators across specialties are chasing the same culprit, studying its effects in diseases ranging from cardio-vascular disease and multiple sclerosis (MS) to rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. Recent high-impact publications demon-strate just how extensively Feinberg scientists have probed this critical factor in disease \u2014 and the translational potential their findings RETURN\" The inflammatory response is a sequential process. When tissue is damaged, specialized immune cells already deployed throughout the body detect certain chemicals associated with invasive pathogens as well as damaged or dead cells. These immune cells then dispatch white blood cells, or leukocytes, and other molecular mediators to destroy any remaining pathogens, repair damage, and restore the body's homeostasis. Ev entually, leukocytes will interact with endothelial cells and move from the blood into the tissue through a process called transendothelial migration, or diapedesis. The phases leading up to diapedesis are reversible. Diapedesis and the phases that follow are not. Diapedesis , which Muller refers to as the \"point of no return,\" is therefore an attractive therapeutic target for regu-lating inflammation and potentially treating chronic inflamma-tory diseases. Regulating inflammation, however, is a balancing act: The goal is to treat chronic inflammation without elimi-nating a patient's entire inflammatory response and rendering them immunocompromised, according to Muller. \" This is the balance we're trying to strike now: How do we treat someone's arthritic fingers or their inflammatory bowel disease or their atherosclerosis without rendering them incapable of fighting off infections or healing skin wounds,\" Muller says. In a r ecent study published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, Muller's laboratory discovered that during transmi-gration, there is a transient increase in endothelial cell calcium ions that are spatially and temporally restricted to the site of diapedesis. The role of the calcium is to activate two key calcium signaling proteins: endothelial calmodulin (CaM) and endothelial calcium/calmodulin kinase II Delta). CaMKII Delta activity is essential for endothelial membrane movement that promotes the transmigration process. Curr ent anti-inflammatory therapies work by block - ing inflammation entirely throughout the body, commonly causing harmful side effects for patients. The findings from the calcium signaling study provide the impetus for regulat-ing inflammation by selectively targeting endothelial cells to decrease the number of white blood cells passing across the endothelial cell wall without interfering with other immune functions, according to Muller. A dditionally, his team is beginning to investigate whether diapedesis is regulated similarly across all organs and tissues, specifically in the lungs and brain. LINKS TO ABNORMAL HEART FUNCTION One part of the body where inflammation wreaks the most havoc is in the heart. Heart failure is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. A significant Muller's lab recently demonstrated that calcium flux in endothelial cells is tightly coupled temporally and spatially with leukocyte transmigra-tion. The arrows depict local elevation of [Ca2 +]i (green) at endothelial junctions (blue) as neutrophils (red) transmigrate across a postcapillary venule in the mouse cremaster muscle in response to the inflammatory cytokine, IL-1 .The lab uses four-dimensional intravital confocal microscopy to study transendothelial migration at high resolution in real time in living animals. Here, Muller (far right), graduate student Maureen Hayes (left), and David Sullivan, PhD, research associate professor of Pathology, review data from a recent experiment. contributor to permanent heart damage after heart attack is due to excessive inflammation caused by reperfusion therapy (a treatment to restore blood flow) that patients receive at the hospital. A r ecent study, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation and led by Edward Thorp, PhD, associate pro-fessor of Pathology in the Division of Experimental Pathology, and Matthew DeBerge, PhD, research assistant professor of Pathology, found that an inflammatory cellular pathway previ-ously thought to protect the heart after a heart attack actually causes damage. The team also found that inhibiting this pathway with small molecule inhibitors reduced myocardial infarction-induced damage in mouse models, demonstrating it as a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for patients after a heart attack. \"If pa tients could take this drug after acute myocardial infarction, we could potentially improve heart repair and there-fore reduce their progression to heart failure,\" Thorp says. 16 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021This image shows an amyloid plaque (blue) surrounded by dystrophic axons (red) and reactive astrocytes (green). The reactive astrocytes respond to the amyloid plaque and participate in the inflammatory response in the Alzheimer's brain. Image courtesy of Robert Vassar, PhD. Ano ther study, led by Sanjiv Shah, '00 MD, the Neil J. Stone, MD, Professor of Cardiology, and published in Circulation, found that the presence of inflammatory proteins in the blood was associated with comorbidity burden and abnormal heart function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). \"Inst ead of the heart being the main area of injury, it is inflammation in the bloodstream that appears to be poisoning the heart and the blood vessels in HFpEF ,\" Shah says. The findings sug gest these proteins could serve as therapeutic targets for patients with HFpEF and act as biomarkers for preventively identifying inflammation. FACTOR IN NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS), all share a common factor \u2014 chronic inflammation. Inflamma tion's role in Alzheimer's disease has been a focus of Robert Vassar, PhD, the Davee Professor of Alzheimer Research. He was co-author of a study published in Nature that identified a missing link between inflammation and protein deposits that con-tribute to the development of the disease. \" These findings shed new light on the role of inflammation in Alzheimer's disease, providing a plausible pathway as well as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for the condition,\" he says. In the study , investigators conducted an unbiased screen to identify proteins that interact with the gamma-secretase complex, which generates the Abeta protein that accumulates in the notorious amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease. That screening identified interferon-induced transmem-brane protein 3 (IFITM3 ). In mo use models of Alzheimer's disease and tissue samples from patients with late-stage Alzheimer's, the investigators found levels of IFITM3 was significantly increased. Deleting IFITM3 , however, reduced the production of Abeta. Simulating inflam-mation also led to increased expression of IFITM3 and subsequently higher levels of Abeta. \" Our study suggests that anti-inflammatory drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier may lower IFITM3 levels and reduce Abeta production, which should delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease,\" Vassar says. Brian P opko, PhD, the William Frederick Windle Professor of Neurology, has investigated the cellular defense response to inflammation in MS, which affects almost three million people worldwide. Pub lished in the journal eLife, his most recent work with postdoctoral fellow Yanan Chen, MD, PhD, suggests that prolonging a cellular defense response to inflammation could help regenerate the protective coating of axons called myelin, which is degraded in diseases like MS. \" This small molecule could be a potential thera- peutic because not only have we shown that it provides protection to oligodendrocytes against inflammation, but we now are showing that it promotes myelin repair in an inflammatory environment,\" says Popko, who is also scientific director of the Division of Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology in the Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology.SANJIV SHAH, MD BRIAN POPKO, PHD MD, PHDROBERT VASSAR, PHD Ultrastructure of myelinated axons in the central nervous system.

In t his study, Perlman and colleagues segre- gated patients based on the genes being produced by their macrophages, the garbage collectors of the immune system that are overactive in rheumatoid arthritis. They identified two patient groups who shared aspects of the genetic profiles and then which of them showed joint improve- ment, along with what biologic therapies they were taking. They also identified a gene sequence associated with patients with early disease. The next goal is to predict which patients will have the best response \u2014 based on their genetic signature \u2014 to a specific drug. In a previous study, published in Nature Communications, Pope and colleagues including first author Qi-Quan Huang, MD, research associate professor in the Division of Rheumatology, developed a mouse model deficient in the FLIP gene. This image from that study shows bone erosion (arrows) and inflammation (brackets) in the ankles of mice without the FLIP gene (bottom). RICHARD POPE, MD DEBORAH WINTER, PHD HARRIS PERLMAN, PHD P opko's team used genetic and pharmacological methods to prolong the integrated stress response in inflammatory models of MS, and discovered that the remyelinating oligodendrocytes, the cells that generate myelin, were protected from inflamma-tion during the repair process. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs that effectively regenerate myelin. The findings, the authors argue, represent a breakthrough therapeutic strategy for treating MS. A POTENTIAL TARGET FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS A team of scientists led by Richard Pope, MD, the Solovy/Arthritis Research Society Professor and pro-fessor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, and Deborah Winter, PhD, assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, discovered that a type of immune cell called tissue-resident macrophage is necessary for the suppression of chronic inflammation. \" This study shows tissue-resident macrophages being the guardian of preventing inflammation and provides a novel way of thinking about treating patients with targeted therapy,\" Pope says. Pr evious work from Pope's laboratory found that a specialized protein called FLIP (FLICE-like inhibitory protein) protects macrophages from apoptosis, or cell death, and are also known to be highly expressed in macrophages of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Using this knowledge, the investigators deleted FLIP from tissue-resident macrophages in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis to ameliorate the disease. However, deleting FLIP actually promoted chronic inflammation in the mice by preventing monocytes \u2014 white blood cells produced in bone marrow \u2014 from differentiating into tissue-resident macrophages and perform anti-inflammatory functions. The findings , which were published in Science Advances, disprove a long-standing notion that all macrophages are \"bad\" and only promote inflammation. \"If w e want to treat people or prevent disease, we can't just get rid of all macrophages,\" Winter says. \"We want to promote macrophages that are good for the joints and possibly reprogram the ones that aren't good.\" A s Muller points out, this area of study is a bal- ancing act \u2014 and scientists across disciplines continue to get closer to answers through shared knowledge. \"It is e xciting to perform these studies at a place like Northwestern, where the research culture is truly collaborative. It leads to great opportunities to combine expertise and explore new disease models,\" Muller says. Rheumatoid Arthritis Meets Precision Medicine TKOCONTROL18 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021hat's in a name? Plenty, says D. James Surmeier, PhD, chair of the recently renamed Department of Neuroscience, for - merly known as the Department of Physiology. The name was officially changed in September to better reflect Northwestern Medicine's exceptional strength in neuroscience. But long before the new departmental letterhead landed on his desk, Surmeier, who has been chair since 2001, had already begun the work of bringing the academic unit national and international attention.WD. James Surmeier, PhD, has steered the Department of Neuroscience to a new name and recognition of Northwestern Medicine's growing prominence in neuroscience research.BY CHERYL SOOHOO PHOTOGRAPHY BY TERESA CRAWFORD19 MAGAZINE.NM.ORG \"In the last 20 years, we have built a critical mass of talent in neuroscience, doubling our size by recruiting the best and brightest young neuroscientists. At Feinberg, we now have one of the largest neuroscience groups in the country. The research being done here is at the cutting edge in many areas of neuroscience, including movement control, neurodegenerative disorders, and neuropsychiatric disor - ders. It's also a great place for young neuroscientists to come and train \u2014 to find their bliss. The name change recognizes what we aspired to be and have become,\" says Surmeier, who is also the Nathan Smith Davis Professor of Neuroscience. \" As a department of physiology, we were consistently ranked in the top 5 to 1 0 programs in the country,\" he adds. \" Although the pool of neuroscience departments is deeper, if the rankings were to be done today, we'd be in the top 1 0 in the nation.\" BUILDING BRIDGES ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY The designation of neuroscience more appropriately describes what the department has been doing for decades: piloting innovative studies in how the central nervous system works \u2014 and, more importantly, when it doesn't work and leads to neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelop- mental disorders. In vestigators focus on topics that span molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels. Basic studies range from single-channel recording to behavioral analysis. Translational work in the department's research portfolio includes Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, brain-machine interfaces, and chronic pain. \"But, of co urse, at Northwestern, the study of neurosci- ence is much broader than our department,\" says Surmeier. The discip line draws upon expertise in myriad fields across the university's two campuses, ranging from chem- istry, engineering, computer science, and biology to areas within the medical school, including neurology, neurosur - gery, anesthesiology, psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and pharmacology. \" One of our aims will be to build bridges that foster sci- entific dialogue, cooperation, and collaboration,\" Surmeier says. \"With the new name, we will build upon our achieve- ments and serve as a beacon to the outside world that there is great neuroscience being conducted at Feinberg and Northwestern at large.\" A flurr y of requests has already come from faculty members seeking secondary appointments. \"The collabora- tive environment here at Northwestern is second to none,\" Surmeier says. STEADY GROWTH, COLLABORATIVE DISCOVERY In the late 1 970s, while pursuing a PhD degree in mathe- matics, Surmeier became fascinated with how the brain functions \u2014 in particular, the basal ganglia, the part of the brain that controls movement. The young scholar decided to shift gears and, in 1 983, completed a doctoral program in physiology-psychology at the University of Washington. He has never looked back. Joining N orthwestern in 1 998, Surmeier has had a prolific career in basal ganglia research, focusing on how it contributes to PD, Huntington's disease, and chronic pain. He has authored well over 200 peer-reviewed publications, many in high-impact journals such as Science, Nature, Neuron , and Nature Neuroscience. In the ear ly 2000s, he and his colleagues made an exciting discovery while exploring the causes of PD. They identified a protein, or more specifically, a calcium channel that triggered mitochondrial oxidant stress in Dopaminergic neurons in brain splices expressing the genetically encoded sensor PercevalHR to monitor intracellular ATP. Image courtesy of the Surmeier Lab. at-risk neurons. This novel finding published in Nature came as a result of collaborating with Paul Schumacker, PhD, professor of Pediatrics, Cell and Developmental Biology, and of Medicine, whose studies focus on the role of mitochondrial signaling in the development of pulmo- nary hypertension. \"It turned o ut that there were drugs approved to treat high blood pressure called dihydropyridines that inhibited this particular calcium channel,\" says Surmeier. \"We thought this class of drugs might help slow the pro- gression of early-stage Parkinson's disease.\" Subsequently , epidemiological studies revealed that patients taking these hypertension medications had a lower risk of developing PD. Surmeier partnered with clinical colleague Tanya Simuni, MD, director of the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center at Feinberg and the Arthur C. Nielsen Professor of Neurology. The Surmeier team's discovery led to a phase II and then a multi-center 20 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021 PAUL SCHUMACKER, P hD, professor of Pediatrics, Cell and Developmental Biology, and of Medicinephase III clinical trial evaluating the dihydropyridine isradipine. Ultimately, the phase III clinical trial, which was completed in 201 8, failed to reach their clinical goals. One of the possib le reasons why the clinical trial failed was that the cardiovascular side-effects of isra- dipine significantly limited how much patients could take. Knowing this limitation, Surmeier teamed with Richard Silverman, PhD, professor in the Department of Chemistry, to develop a new, more selective inhib- itor of the calcium channel implicated in PD. This long-standing collaboration has led to the identification of a novel drug class that has great promise. A collabo- rative effort between Surmeier, Silverman, and Alfred George, MD, chair of the Department of Pharmacology and the Alfred Newton Richards Professor of Pharmacology, has recently been endorsed by the Michael J. Fox Foundation with a multi-year award to identify compounds that have clinical potential. \"W e are still confident that we have the right target and that by improving delivery of isradipine to the brain or by developing a more selective inhibitor, we can slow the progression of Parkinson's disease,\" says Surmeier. \"But even if achieving adequate target engagement isn't feasible, this translational effort will teach us something important about the disease and bring us closer to a therapy that will succeed. It also has illustrated that Northwestern offers an environ- ment that brings together people from different disci- plines to effectively work toward a shared vision.\" The Surmeier and S chumacker labs have con- tinued to tease out how their target protein interacts with the mitochondria and leads to PD. Better under - standing the connection may allow for potentially changing the dialog between the two and altering the course of disease development. In a recent study published in Nature, Surmeier and Schumacker demonstrated that loss of mitochondrial complex I function in dopaminergic neurons is sufficient in mice to produce a progressive, levodopa- responsive parkinsonism with features that closely resemble those of human PD. This work establishes a clear chain of events - from calcium channel mediated over-stimulation of mitochondria, to mitochondrial oxidant stress and damage to complex I, to PD pathogenesis. A s is often the case in science, there were unexpected findings, according to Surmeier. In this case, the progressive nature of the model allowed the investigators to dissect the role of regional dopamine depletion in driving PD symptoms. This work led to the surprising conclusion that the output of the basal ganglia (the substantia nigra) was a critical site of dopamine action in preventing movement deficits. Surmeier's team then demonstrated that a gene therapy could significantly boost the effects of levodopa in a model of late-stage PD \u2014 providing a potential alternative to deep brain stimulation. NOVEL RESEARCH FINDINGS Undeniably excited about asking research questions and finding the answers to them, Surmeier's curiosity has continued to yield novel research discoveries with transla- tional implications. One long -standing mystery has been why neurons that release dopamine are particularly vulnerable in PD. A collaborative study with Dimitri Krainc, MD, chair and Aaron Montgomery Ward Professor of Neurology, published in Science a few years ago, revealed that this vulnerability could be traced to an interaction between mitochondria and Partners in Discovery TANY A SIMUNI, MD , director of the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center at Feinberg and the Arthur C.

This October, the Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP) initiative awarded not only one but two $9 million grants to two different teams of Feinberg neuro- scientists exploring the biological causes of Parkinson's disease to develop new therapies. \"T o have two of 14 successful groups in this intense interna- tional competition come from Northwestern is an extraordinary accomplishment,\" says Surmeier, the coordinating lead principal investi- gator for one of the winning Feinberg projects. \"This success is a testa-ment to the fact that Northwestern has become an international leader in neuroscience research.\" S urmeier's ASAP-funded project will explore the circuit dysfunction underlying motor and sleep deficits in a progressive mouse model of PD. Better understanding how this dys-function begins could offer promise for earlier diagnosis, development of disease-modifying therapies, and enhanced treatment strategies for patients with later-stage PD. New faculty member Ann Kennedy, PhD, assistant professor of Neuroscience and other co-investigators at Leading the Way Columbia University, U.C. Berkeley, and the University of Basel (Switzerland) will be serving as co-investigators. An A SAP award also went to Rajeshwar Awatramani, PhD, pro-fessor of Neurology in the Division of Movement Disorders, and his team for their project entitled \"Redefining PD Pathophysiology Mechanisms in the Context of Heterogeneous Substantia Nigra Neuron Subtypes.\" This project involves neuroscience faculty from Feinberg, as well as neurobiology faculty on the Evanston campus. Laun ched in 2017, the ASAP initiative is a private organization of funders working with the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research to accelerate discovery by building a collaborative research network. PD is one of the most common movement disorders in the world, with some six million people living with the disease. T his most recent competition called for applications that focused primarily on circuitry and brain-body interactions \u2014 both areas of expertise at Northwestern. \"These awards reflect the commitment of Northwestern to excellence in neuroscience research across both campuses,\" Surmeier says.dopamine. But the precise nature of this interaction was unclear. T eaming with Krainc and Schumacker, Surmeier and his associates discovered that mitochondria were metabolizing dopamine in axons \u2014 the most at-risk part of the neuron \u2014 to help them generate energy (adenos- ine triphosphate) for transmitter release. This boosting was mediated by monoamine oxidase (MAO) tethered to the outer membranes of the mitochondria. This process created oxidant stress on the mitochondria, particularly when dopamine synthesis was boosted by a precursor of dopamine \u2014 levodopa. This new finding has provided more insight into the role mitochondria, dopamine, and MAO play in PD and how that knowledge can inform current and future treatment. Patients with early-stage PD, for example, are often given MAO inhibitors to help boost dopamine levels in the brain. Published in Nature Neuroscience, this study suggests that this treatment strategy protects vulnerable dopaminergic neurons by limiting mitochondrial stress and damage. Connecting seemingly disparate \"dots\" often leads to breakthroughs in science. A key feature of PD pathology is the formation of intracellular aggregates of a protein called alpha-synuclein. It has been thought that these aggregates spread through the brain, much like a prion. In a study published in Science Advances in 2020, Surmeier's team showed that strength or number of neuron-to-neuron connections was not a good predictor of how alpha-synuclein pathology spread. This finding raised the possibility that other neuronal traits, like mitochondrial oxidant stress, were important factors. The Northwestern investigators are actively pursuing the mitochondrial connection and exploring possible links between pathogenic mechanisms in PD. This work opens the door to the potential use and effectiveness of combination therapies to slow disease progression. In ano ther area of research, Surmeier has made inroads in developing the first viable treatment for Huntington's disease \u2014 a degenerative disease charac- terized by progressive motor and cognitive impairment and caused by alteration in the \"huntingtin\" gene. His team has published a series of papers in journals such as Nature Medicine, demonstrating that lowering mutant huntingtin with a zinc finger gene therapy effectively reverses neuronal pathology and behavioral deficits in animal models of Huntington's disease. \"W e have an extraordinary opportunity to better understand the brain and to develop new treatments for brain disorders,\" he says. \"New technologies are allow - ing us to link brain function at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels to behavior in unprecedented ways. At the same time, we have a growing set of tools for correct- ing neuronal dysfunction that is making its way into the clinic. We truly have exciting times ahead of us.\" 22 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021lutching the sides of buildings for stability as he walked to his office, Greg Duplaga, 65, was at his wit's end. Meticulous in his work as a permit engineer for the Chicago Fire Department, he was selling himself short when it came to his own health. \"I could not walk because both my feet were numb, and I was afraid I was going to collapse because I was not feeling them,\" he says. Dup laga's primary care physician knew his patient's symptoms of numb feet and legs, along with neurogenic bladder, required urgent attention and steered him to Northwestern Medicine's Center for Spine Health. Imaging revealed severe spinal compression, making the last resort \u2014 surgery \u2014 the only solution. Had Duplaga not acted when he did, he could have had persistent issues for the rest of his life. While the thought of spine surgery can be scary, Duplaga fondly remembers a reassuring sur - gical team looking down at him in the operating room this past July. \"I knew tha t I could not live the way I did before my proce- dure,\" he says. \"I am very lucky to be in the Chicago area with access to the best doctors.\" Opened in June 2021 , the Spine Center was created to quickly steer patients with back, neck, and spine pain \u2014 who might otherwise consult with five or six different types of specialists and come out with just as many treatment options from different institutions \u2014 to the correct treatment. Patients like Duplaga, who WRITTEN BY MARTHA O'CONNELL PHOTOGRAPHY BY LAURA BROWN Northwestern Medicine's Center for Spine Health gets patients back on their feet.

It is this patient major - ity that the center is designed to serve. Instead of waiting to see a surgeon, patients are assessed by a multidisciplinary team to determine the best treatment. \" The right place for a patient to start is not at the end of the road with a surgeon, who sometimes can take two months to be available and may not even be the right person to treat the patient,\" says center co-director Alpesh Patel, '00 MD, '20 MBA, professor of Orthopaedic Surgery and of Neurological Surgery. \"We have dramatically flipped the care model.\" ALLEVIATING FEAR After four years of envisioning and planning, the Spine Center is now one of two such integrated academic medical center programs in the nation, combining all subspecialists in spine care. This eliminates the frag - mented care patients may receive if they search for individual experts on their own, not to mention pain that is unnecessarily prolonged. \"When w e were thinking out what the center should do, we got past our credentials, if you will, and down to the nuts and bolts of what we care about, and how we build trust to work with each other,\" Patel says. The Spine C enter includes a cadre of interventional radiologists, physiatrists from the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, nurses, neurosurgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, physical therapists, physician assistants, and support staff who all put their heads together to determine the best clinical approach for each patient and expedite therapy. Mimicking pr evalence in the larger population, complaints about lower back pain account for a majority of patients. \"We are increasing the number of patients who get the right treatment and get it faster than they would if they started with a surgeon.\" TYLER KOSKI, MD associate professor of Neurological Surgery and of Orthopaedic Surgery 24 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021But for many, the mere thought of surgery is alarming. In fact, patients are asked on the intake questionnaire to rank how interested they are in spine surgery \u2014 many patients give this a \"0.\" In the past, those patients would still wait to see a surgeon. Now they can get to a non-surgical specialist in a shorter time. The Spine C enter aims to take that fear away at the outset by reinforcing potential non-surgical options. Intake experts help start patients' paths by directing them to specialists according to symptoms described. Located on the 14th floor of Northwestern Memorial's Lavin Pavilion, the center encompasses just about every service patients might need. In addi- tion to exam rooms, there are imaging areas and suites for corticosteroid injections. The physical therapy area is in the center, housing state-of-the-art equipment such as zero-gravity treadmills for low weight bearing exercise in water during the early stages of recovery. \"W e are increasing the number of patients who get the right treatment and get it faster than they would if they started with a surgeon,\" says center co-director Tyler Koski, MD, asso- ciate professor of Neurological Surgery and of Orthopaedic Surgery. \"This is much more efficient and timely care and gets people to the right medical provider at the right time. And if it turns out that a patient does need an opera- tion, they have already done their due diligence with other consults and therapies. For patients like Mr. Duplaga, we were able to expedite his visit with me right away due to our algorithm.\" Man y patients who seek care at the Spine Center are experiencing muscle strain, spinal stenosis, bulging disks, shooting nerve pain, and other injuries or deformities that make walking agonizing or at least uncomfortable. To accommodate them, the center is organized in a loop configuration so patients only move forward through treatment areas before they exit, never backwards. The flow is logical and seamless, and reduces walking. Also, men's and women's changing rooms are connected to imaging rooms for privacy, and hallways are oriented for abundant natural light. This all adds up to an improved psychological experi- ence that came about because patients were integrally involved in designing the center. The Spine C enter is also the first to pilot a patient tracking system that holds tremendous potential for other healthcare environments. A software program shows staff where each patient is at all times. When they check in, patients receive a badge with a QR code and Bluetooth sensor. Developed by a Northwestern Medicine physician, this tracking system relays the location of every patient, and an alert signals the team if a patient has been in one place for a long time. With hundreds of patients seen daily and many medical providers, the tracking system ensures that patients don't have lengthy waits or feel abandoned. ANSWERING A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM Nationally, lower back pain is the second most common reason people visit their physician. Healthcare systems like Northwestern Medicine GREG DUPLAGA\"I knew that I could not live the way I did before my procedure.

The same thing that has hap- pened with other high-volume types of care, such as for patients with diabetes or those who need hip replacements, is filtering down to the complexities of spine care, and value-based care is the new standard. A s the center was being planned, Patel, Koski and the rest of the Spine Center team believed they could not bring each patient the best possible outcomes without a unified clini- cal approach. \" Sometimes, too many cooks in the kitchen is not a good thing \u2014 you get too many conflicting ideas and too many appointments and treatments that don't give patients any Top: Imaging provides accurate information at all stages of care.

Under her lead- ership, the library's national and international reach continues to grow. G alter is uniquely organized within the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences (NUCATS) Institute, where Holmes leads the Evaluation and Continuous Improvement Program. This pow - erful data-driven evaluation infrastructure is leveraged by over $1 00 million in funded programs designed to enhance processes and impact by improving data quality for stra- tegic management and decision-making. H olmes was recently appointed to the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Board of Regents. The appoint- ment marks the first time a Northwestern faculty member has joined the prestigious NLM Board, which is charged with advising and guiding the NLM as it manages the global flow of medical information. The NLM is r esponsible for essential biomedical resources such as the PubMed database, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data and tools, and the clinicaltrials.gov registry. The NLM also ensures that the public has access to reliable health information through resources such as MedlinePlus, which provides up-to-date easy-to-understand health and wellness infor - mation covering a wide range of topics. \" The NLM is charged with managing a terrific amount of data and standards,\" says Holmes, who is also professor of Preventive Medicine and of Medical Education. \"These urgently important resources and the expertise of NLM's personnel impact the entire spectrum of research and health.\" The NLM, thr ough the NCBI, just announced plans to launch the NIH Comparative Genomics Resource (CGR), a four-year trans-NIH initiative to provide a com- parative genomics cloud-based data and tool resource for eukaryotic research organisms. Holmes will chair the CGR working group to provide an open, transparent forum for exten- sive engagement of the scientific community to gather input from diverse perspectives and communities to help guide the development of this new resource. FROM MICROSCOPES TO BIOINFORMATICS Holmes grew up in Western Nebraska, fasci- nated by the natural world surrounding her. \"Loo king back, my mom and dad did an amazing job of indulging my interest in science,\" she says. \"I had a microscope and a telescope from a very early age, a steady stream of books, and even today, we enjoy Milky Way stargazing and fossil hunting in the Sandhills where our cattle graze.\" She w ent on to get a PhD in biochemis- try and credits the data collection and cura-tion work she carried out during graduate school with sparking her interest in informa- tion structure and datasets, and ultimately, biomedical informatics and data science. After completing graduate school, she joined Washington University in St. Louis as a bioinformaticist at Becker Medical Library to channel her interests in informatics into infrastructure development. She joined Northwestern in 201 4. \"Ev ery day is a new challenge and a new opportunity to learn and grow at Galter,\" she says. \"The library truly provides an excellent vantage point on campus because it serves as an intersection of many different areas of excellence at Northwestern. Our talented and dedicated team is charged with a vast array of responsibilities, resources, systems, and A GAL TER LIBRARY IS A WORLD- CLASS LIBRARY AND TRUSTED PARTNER TO THE NORTHWESTERN COMMUNITY.

INFORMATION INNOVATOR 28 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021 Earlier this year, the library was named the National Evaluation Center for the Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM), a group of seven regional libraries and 8,000 member organizations across the U.S. that disseminate health information through public libraries, schools, community-based organizations, and patient advocacy groups. The affiliation with Galter came with a five-year, $4 million award to help boost inclusive access to health information and use of cutting-edge, data-driven technology. \"T he new National Evaluation Center is a great way for Northwestern to shine, and I am honored to be joined by such an accomplished team of collaborators,\" says Holmes. \"We're excited for this opportunity to share our work on the national stage in support of such an important mission.\" T he center will be led by a talented, multidisciplinary team of faculty and builds on data and evaluation resources across Feinberg, including Galter, NUCATS, the Evaluation, Data Integration, and T echnical Assistance program, and beyond. partnerships, many of which are behind the scenes.\" In her r ole as director of Galter, Holmes has transitioned from hands-on data work to strategizing about research information systems, team science, technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as partnerships across Northwestern and with community organizations. \"N ever before have data and technology played such a central role in how we carry out our work. Even so, our library mission remains focused on supporting the research, patient care, education, and community engagement goals of Feinberg,\" she says. GROWING MENU OF SERVICES Galter Library is a world-class library and trusted partner to the Northwestern commu- nity. The library facility serves as a bustling center for learning, sharing, and collaboration. Exhibits and programming catalyze in-depth discussions on a wide range of topics and share the history of the Feinberg School of Medicine. Behind the scenes, Galter provides rapid access to a wide range of information resources, thanks to a talented team working on different facets of library services and systems. G alter has expanded considerably under Holmes's leadership. The library offers a liaison librarian program to provide every department, center, and institute at Feinberg a depend- able partner to quickly connect them with research information support. Galter also offers popular systematic review services, a clinical informationist program, world-class research assessment and communications services, and an extensive list of classes across a wide range of topics. The library also collaborates on several NIH-funded community partnerships that provide access to authoritative health information, empower research participation, and support efforts to advance knowledge and health equity. The libr ary's DataLab offers a high-tech data core for training, one-on-one consultations, and building a community of practice around translational informatics, data management and analysis, and digital systems. Over the past year, the DataLab has partnered with Northwestern Medicine's Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) on a new clinical data retrieval and management program that continues to evolve in response to campus needs. Ano ther sign of Galter's growing reach as a national and international leader in data science is its partnership on an international effort with the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN), one of Europe's most well-respected research centers, to develop InvenioRDM, an open-access research data management repository and data catalogue to promote best practices in data management, sharing, and reuse. InvenioRDM supports FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, making it a valuable tool to support open science, comply with research sharing requirements such as the upcoming NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, and enable discovery of Northwestern research. The long-term support version of the software was just released in August, with several uni- versities already committing to adopt the tool. \"In venioRDM brings together best practice data standards and technology in a smooth package,\" Holmes explains. \"I am incredibly proud of our team's contributions and their role in this important international project. This has been a massive undertaking and we look forward to implementing it for Northwestern.\" G alter is also a critical hub for the Feinberg community and was one of the only health science libraries to remain open throughout the pandemic. Holmes credits the library's Access Services team for making this possible, successfully creating a welcoming, productive, and healthy physical space for in-person study, research, and collaboration. \"W e're fortunate to have such a talented team across Galter,\" Holmes says. \"The work we do fully reflects our campus \u2014 a place where there's such enthusiasm, creativity, and dedication. It's really what makes it possible for us to push boundaries and all play our part in advancing Northwestern's mission.\" EVALUATION EXCELLENCE Holmes with her husband and sons. 29 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGALUMNI Alumni President's Message he number 50 has come to symbolize many important events. Bir thdays are the first to come to mind. As we age, different milestones carry significance. When kids reach double digits, teenage years, and certainly 1 6, 18 and 21 , they begin to have more freedoms. Not long afterward, real adulthood looms large. Many fear 30 and 40. I still remember as a first-year at Feinberg, our biochemistry professor said that biochemically speaking, everything is downhill after age 33, as the body goes from a healing mode to an aging mode. (That's what I remember from biochemistry.) Ugh. F ifty brings its own mix of feelings. I had the privilege of turning 50 during the pandemic. This milestone made me reflect on many things, including that I'm more than halfway through life. On the more positive sides, it made me excited to look down the road, to assess my family, their future, and the cherished memories we will create. My wife Florence celebrated her 50th birthday recently, and I had the privilege of spending it with her. The positive outlook of 50 is so symbolic and important. In case y ou are wondering, we're called quinquagenarians. If ma thematics is more your thing, then 50 is the smallest number that is the sum of two non-zero square numbers in two distinct ways: 50 = 12 + 72 = 52 + 52. (I had to look at this a couple times to understand it. In r eligion, we have several meanings for 50.Let's All Be Quinquagenarians! A letter from Edward S. Kim, '92 BS, '96 MD (HPME) In K abbalah, there are 50 Gates of Wisdom (or Understanding) and 50 Gates of Impurity. The Christian F east of Pentecost takes place on the 50th day of the Easter Season. The Jewish Pentecost takes place 50 days after the Passover feast (the holiday of Shavuoth). A ccording to Biblical Numerology, the number 50 is a symbol of freedom, release, and new cycle. Every 50 years in the day of Atonement people needed to honor the Jubilee, a day when all the loans and debts were forgotten and forgiven to the one who took a debt, and all the slaves were released, and all the things taken were turned back to people they belonged to. It was a day when harmony was established. Since w e are all in science, we should also include the fact that 50 is the atomic number of tin, the fifth magic number in nuclear physics, and the percent of genetic overlap of a parent and offspring. If w e want to explore what the character- istics or horoscope for 50 is, there are some fun facts according to Affinity Numerology. The numerology number 50 expresses its sense of personal freedom \u2014 the pursuit of whatever may be of interest without resistance from its inner self or from others. The number 50 likes to talk and play and imagine and have fun, especially when it involves experiencing something it hasn't experienced before. The number 50 is witty. People generally smile a lot when they're around 50. The essence of the number 50 almost always focuses on the positive side of things rather than the negative. I believe it is these characteristics of 50 that we should embrace and move forward with. This coming spring, during Alumni Weekend (April 29-30), we have three classes celebrating their 50th reunions: 1970, 1971, and 1 972. Two were postponed, but milestones are important to celebrate \u2014 even belatedly! At Feinberg, we also have the Half Century Club, which celebrates alumni who graduated 50+ years ago. Personally, I will be celebrating my belated 25th reunion this year (halfway to 50). A s we transition into another fall and winter season and celebrate various milestones, let's all be 50 \u2014 whatever your age, it's a good state of mind.

A t the time, only immature eggs could be frozen, but there was no way to allow them to mature outside of a woman's ovary. This was a major barrier to helping preserve the fertility of women with cancer or other conditions. The solution Carson developed was an early generation 3-dimensional organoid of the ovary. She and her colleagues grew layers of donated ovarian cells in a mold into a mini ovary that was able to mimic the environment that allows the egg to mature. The achievement was named one of the top 1 0 medical breakthroughs of the year by Time magazine. Now that it is possible to freeze mature eggs, the device has found a new use testing the effects of reproductive toxins and chemotherapeutic drugs on devel- oping eggs in the laboratory. The ar tificial ovary is one of many solu- tions developed by Carson, who holds 1 4 patents and has published more than 1 60 journal arti- cles during her career. She has developed tools that obstetrician-gynecologists use during pro- cedures to diagnose uterine disorders and she also developed a nonsurgical way of diagnosing and treating ectopic pregnancies. \"It 's not that I wanted to develop a device to develop a device,\" Carson says. \"It's because there was a problem that came up that we needed a solution for.\" Fertility Pioneer W A Career is Born When Carson began her medical education journey at Northwestern, she had her sights set on becoming an anesthesiologist. She wanted to get an MD and PhD in chemistry and do pharma- cokinetic research. Delivering a baby in October 1977 as a medical student under the supervision of a resident permanently shifted her career path toward obstetrics. But she quickly found herself drawn to reproductive endocrinology, the only field that could keep her up reading after being up all night at the hospital. \"I nev er had another 5-year plan after that,\" Carson says. A fter completing her residency in obstet- rics and gynecology at Northwestern in 1 981, she completed a fellowship in reproductive endo-crinology at Michael Reese Hospital and the University of Chicago Medical Center. It was a heady time in the field of reproductive endocrinol- ogy. The first baby successfully delivered after in vitro fertilization (IVF), Louise Brown was born in England in 1978 and three years later the first (IVF) conceived baby was born in the United States. \" Over the last 40 years, I grew up with the field,\" Carson says. Tha t experience really shaped her approach to research. Over the years, she recalls, some things initially believed to be inconsequential proved to be essential, and procedures once considered taboo become common place. For example, she says that 31 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGProfile 1977 Graduated from the six-year Honors Program in Medical Education at Northwestern1983- 1986 Worked as assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine1994- 2007 Became director of Baylor Assisted Reproductive Technology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston2003- 2007 Served as vice president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists1983 Finished fellowship in reproductive endocrinology at Michael Reese Hospital and the University of Chicago Medical School1986- 1994 Joined faculty at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine in Memphis and served as chief of In Vitro Fertilization2002- 2003 Elected pres - ident of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine2007- 2013 Named director of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island2013- 2019 Joined the leadership team at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as vice president of education2019- present Directs the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Yale University Medical School2007- 2011 Became editor-in- chief of Sexuality, Reproduction and MenopauseIt taught me to always question the axioms and not to be afraid to design studies that some people say can't be done. \" initially she and her colleagues believed injecting anything into the egg would kill it, but now sperm is routinely injected into eggs. \"It taught me t o always question the axioms and not to be afraid to design studies that some people say can't be done,\" Carson says. Tha t perspective empowered Carson to present research at the 44th Annual Meeting of the American Fertility Society in 1 988 on a nonsurgical algorithm for diagnosing and treating ectopic pregnancy, despite initial resistance to the idea. She also participated in the initial clinical trials of methotrexate to treat ectopic pregnancy. It took almost two years to get the trial results, because there was hesitance in the field to switching to treat- ing the life-threatening condition with a drug, she said. But now methotrexate is routinely used to treat ectopic pregnancies. Car son continues to be an innovator in the field. She recently developed a new device with her colleague John Buster, MD, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Women & Infant Fertility Center in Providence, Rhode Island. \"It's a catheter that can flush embryos out of the uterus for genetic testing. This allows women who are interested in genetic testing for their embryos to avoid the need for in vitro fertilization,\" she explains. \" This is an easy process where the patient can have sex at home and then have her uterus lavaged and have the embryo retrieved,\" she says. This dev elopment work has been shaped by Carson's experience working with patients, as attending physician and an assistant profes- sor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Tennessee College of Medicine. She later served in leadership roles in assisted reproduction and reproductive endocrinology and as professor of obstetrics and gynecol- ogy at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine in Memphis, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and at the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University in Rhode Island. Throughout most of her career, Carson not only cared for patients as their reproductive endocrinologist, but she also delivered many of her patients' babies. \" There is no honor greater than a patient inviting you to deliver her baby,\" she says. \"I love obstetrics.\" Giving Back Though Carson no longer practices obstetrics she continues to care for patients in her current role as director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Yale University Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut where she is professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences and Director of the section of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility . \"I had a w onderful career in obstetrics and gynecology, and I loved it,\" she says. \"I loved the teaching, the patients, and the education.\" She continues t o relish the opportunity to mentor medical students, residents, fellows, and other faculty as they grow their own careers in her current role. She is inspired by the many wonderful mentors she had at Northwestern who emphasized the importance of being a part of the community of medicine by participat- ing in medical organizations like the Chicago Gynecological Society, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), and the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology. She t ook that lesson to heart and served as the vice president of education at ACOG for six years. In that role, she helped put the annual examination for obstetrics and gynecology resi-dents online, making it available for residents in 11 countries. She also helped boost attendance at ACOG's annual meeting by shortening it and increasing the number of interactive sessions. Additionally, Carson has served as president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine from 2002 to 2003 and as chair of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Advisory Committee on Reproductive Drugs as well as editor-in-chief of the journal Sexuality, Reproduction and Menopause and The New England Journal of Medicine's publication NEJM Journal Watch Women's Health. \"I w anted to give back to the field while I was young enough to do it,\" she says, adding \"It's important to connect with people you are working with, remember those who have trained you, and pass your knowledge forward.\" \" CAREER MILESTONES32 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021ALUMNIPROGRESS NOTES David Skorton, '74 MD, gave testimony on the topic \" A Dire Shortage and Getting Worse: Solving the Crisis in the Healthcare Workforce\" before the Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

Unfortunately, due to COVID- 19, IAHW 2020 activities were either canceled or significantly scaled back. In Mar ch of 2021 , however, Offutt worked closely with Youth Ambassadors from six conti- nents, and in collaboration with the International Association of Adolescent Health and the Society of Adolescent Health and Medicine, to celebrate IAHW across the world through a combination of in-person and virtual events. In honor of IAHW , buildings and structures were illuminated lime green, the official color of IAHW . With the theme of \" Adolescent Resilience in the Face of a Pandemic,\" events were held in more than 30 countries across six continents. They included an educational webinar hosted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization chair on Global Health and Education, a special press briefing by the Nigerian Minister of Health, a podcast focused on adolescent resilience hosted by the American Medical Association, and a digital gallery with submissions from international youth sharing how they experience living in a pandemic. 534 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE FALL 2021ALUMNIProgress Notes Cory Simpson, '1 0 PhD, '1 2 MD, FAAD, a grad- uate of the Feinberg Medical Scientist Training Program, recently accepted an assistant pro- fessor position at the University of Washington after completing his dermatology residency and research fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania.

I have worn the purple for undergraduate, medical school, residency, and lastly as an attending for 34 years. I entered an institution that did not see the systemic racism and bias it harbored but I have stayed because that same institution was willing to work on changing that culture. The first \"minority affairs\" office at NUMS (Northwestern University Medical School) was unofficial and located in the small backroom of the research lab of the only basic science African American faculty member at the medical school, Dr. Dennis Perry. It was a safe space for the few minority medical students and residents to find allyship. He was a diversity trailblazer at NUMS at a time when the culture of the place reflected the discrimination and bias of society overall against African Americans in particular. Delores Brown was appointed as the Minority Affairs Dean along with her real job as Dean of Admissions once Dr. Perry retired. This two-job plan for one person was not designed for successful equity work; however, I worked beside both of them on committees, panels, and task forces throughout my medical school, residency, and early attending years, finally becoming the first Minority Affairs Dean with a sliver of protected time and a program assistant supported by the medical school. The first official Office of Minority Affairs was on the first floor of the Ward Building and only large enough for one desk for the program assistant. That progress from the back closet of a microbiology lab to the first floor of a major medical school building took 15 years of work by likeminded diversity workers from the ranks of medical students, residents, faculty, and administrators. That shared accomplishment was real change.\" \u2014 Tacoma McKnight, '81 BS, '83 MD (HPME), '87 GME, associate professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Inclusion and Allyship: Sharing Stories We would love to hear your stories of Inclusion and Allyship.

He was raised in Polson, Montana and attended Montana State University, followed by Northwestern for medical school. Koehler served his country as a navy doctor. He then practiced medicine in California and spent 25 years on the staff of Kaiser Permanente in Portland, Oregon. Sailing, particularly wooden boats, was a passion. In his retirement, he enjoyed building furniture and boats while managing Koehler's 7L Polled Hereford farm. Koehler supported the Clackamas County Junior Livestock Auction for 42 years. He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Mary Lou, daughters Lou Anna Koehler and Celia Koehler, son-in-law Paul Blanchard, and sister Karol Newgard. 37 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGProgress Notes Lewis Landsberg, MD, former dean of the Feinberg School of Medicine and chair of the Department of Medicine SEPTEMBER 23, 2021 Lewis Landsberg, MD, transformed the medical school during his 30-year career. He joined the faculty in 1990 as the Irving S. Cutter Professor and chairman of the Department of Medicine and as physician-in-chief at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Nine years later, he was appointed vice president for medical affairs and dean of the medical school. Lan dsberg was a towering figure in the fields of metabolism regulation, the sympathetic nervous system, hypertension, and obesity. He was also the author of more than 230 peer-reviewed publications and two books, which summarized his personal clinical experience in internal medicine, as well as his laboratory research. \"Le wis Landsberg was an inspiring leader, a peerless bedside teacher, and an exceptional scientist. As a dean, his tenure was an energizing force and his influence can now be felt in every part of the medical school. Even today, we continue to build on the foundation that he started. He will be sorely missed as a friend of many, but he leaves behind an enduring legacy,\" says Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for medical affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean. Lan dsberg received his bachelor's degree from Williams College in 1960 and his medical degree from Yale University School of Medicine in 1964. He pursued residency training in internal medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital, and a research fellowship at the National Institutes of Health, working in the laboratory of Nobel laureate Julius Axelrod, MD. He was recruited to Northwestern from Harvard Medical School, where he had served as professor of Medicine and chief of the Division of Endocrinology at the Beth Israel Hospital. A fter stepping down as dean, the medical staff of Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation made an extraordinary endowment gift to create and name the Lewis Landsberg Deanship. The Lewis Landsberg Society was created by former chief residents in the Department of Medicine who trained under Landsberg, and connects former Northwestern housestaff in medicine for professional exchange and continuing medical education. Feinberg's annual celebration of research at the medical school, Lewis Landsberg Research Day, was also named in his honor. \"Dr . Landsberg will be remembered for the legacy of his mentorship, his dedicated exuberance and passion for medical education and excellence, and the devotion and deep admiration for him held by the thousands of the trainees he imprinted upon during his tenure. He was the foundation on which the Department of Medicine was built. The culture of excellence, the national reputation, the success we enjoy today in the areas of training, investigation and clinical care can all be traced back to him and his enduring influence,\" says Douglas Vaughan, MD, the chair and Irving S.

Jim 's unwavering enthusiasm for biology never faded even during his long battle with lung cancer. During the last 11 years with the disease, he showed a level of endurance and courage that many times seemed outright superhuman. We will miss him dearly.

Northwestern became Jim's only scientific home, where he ascended through the ranks becoming full professor in 2007. Initially, his research Joanne Smith, MDpresident and CEO of Shirley Ryan AbilityLabChicago, Illinois SEPTEMBER 6, 2021 Joanne Smith, MD, was the driving force behind the transformation of care delivery in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. As the president and CEO of the No. 1-ranked Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, she envisioned the world's first-ever \"translational\" research hospital in which physicians, scientists, innovators, technologists and clinicians work together in the same space, surrounding patients, discovering novel approaches and applying (or \"translating\") research in real time. focused on membrane polarity. These studies set the stage for the identification of a novel actin binding protein family which he named espins. Jim found that espins were widely distributed, especially in the hair cells of the cochlea of the inner ear. This led him to studies of a mutant mouse, which had been maintained as a model for deafness since the early 1940s. Jim discovered that the deafness was attributable to a loss of espin. The rest of his career was dedicated to demonstrating the importance of the espins in the bundling of F-actin in the stereocilia of the mouse hair cells and its relevance to normal hearing and in deafness. Jim's findings significantly impacted our understanding of mechanosensation in the inner ear, and the audiology field leapt forward as the result of his work. Jim di splayed relentless curiosity and a remarkable scientific compass which led to the important discoveries that will carry his name well into the future. He was also a gifted speaker, whether it was to his professional colleagues or to graduate or medical students in course lectures. He dedicated 34 years to Northwestern that impacted generations of students and researchers worldwide. S mith came to the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago for her residency in 1988 and never left. In 1992, she became an attending physician and was subsequently tapped to take on various leadership roles of increasing responsibility. In 2006, a few years after earning her MBA from the University of Chicago, she became president and CEO. S mith was widely recognized as a thought leader. In 2021 and 2019, she was named to Modern Healthcare's exclusive \"Top 25 Women Leaders\" list. In 2019, she spoke at the Aspen Ideas Festival, the nation's premier public gathering of leaders from around the globe. In 2018, she presented at the first-ever Wall Street Journal Future of Everything Festival, an ideas exchange focused on innovations that are transforming the world.

But, unlike (hopefully) many of you, I've also spent the last year bat- tling brain cancer. During m y third year of my internal med- icine residency at the University of Minnesota, I spent a month studying in Thailand. While there, I developed strange symptoms, includ- ing tingling in my left hand and difficulty swallow - ing, and ended up diagnosing myself with a brain tumor. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a malignant brain cancer, requiring two brain surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation. F ortunately, I'm still here to tell you my story. I was extremely lucky that cancer did not impact my ability to practice medicine. Instead, I've found that my experience as a patient \u2014 particularly in those early days at a hospital in Thailand \u2014 became one of my most valuable medical lessons. The ev ening after my initial brain scan showed a brain tumor, I was admitted for urgent evaluation and treatment for seizures and brain swelling. Although the medical care system works differently in Thailand than in America, many of the basic logistical aspects were familiar to me. I knew that the physician would order initial labs and vital sign checks, so I was prepared when the lab technician came into my room, stuck an IV in me, and took a few vials of blood without saying a word. I was also mentally prepared to be woken up extra minutes with my own patients and provide them with knowledge to feel safe, respected, and understood, rather than afraid and confused. In the end, one of the g reatest diffi- cult gifts of my cancer diagnosis and treat- ment was actually my experience being a patient. Cancer has taught me more about living, mortality, health, wellness, and patient care than any textbook ever could. This piece was adapted from Burnett's memoir Difficult Gifts: A Physician's Journey to Heal Body and Mind, available at www. elephantlotusbraintumor.com, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or at your local bookstore. Being a patient is terrifying. Autonomy is gone. You find yourself with a million unanswered questions.ACCEPTING THE DIFFICUL T GIFTS OF A CANCER DIAGNOSIS from sleep every few hours for vital signs, routine monitoring of my heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. Ev ery time a familiar activity happened, I felt grateful. OK, I know what this is. I can feel the blood pressure cuff squeezing my arm. I can read my blood pressure measurement; I know this number is OK. When an IV pole was wheeled into my room and fluids were hung next to me, I thought, OK, this is a familiar intravenous fluid. I know why the physician ordered this and I know what effects it will have on me. None of this was explained to me as it was happening. A s a physician, I often make the decision to order labs, place IV lines, start fluids, and do vital sign checks without informing my patients of these decisions. I always inform my patients of critical changes in their treat-ment plans or test results; however, routine tasks such as those above are as common-place in medicine as sending an email would be in the corporate world. Physicians do not always remember that for patients, an email feels very different than a blood draw. I abso lutely cannot fathom how terrifying it would be to be a patient, let alone a patient in a foreign country, lying alone in a hospital room undergoing the above procedures without knowing why these things happen, when they happen, or what the results mean. The only reason I felt comfortable in this situation was that it is my day-to-day job. Being a pa tient is terrifying. Autonomy is gone. You find yourself with a million unanswered questions, and you spend hours waiting for a physician you just met to tell you the worst news of your life. After this hospital admission, I decided then that when I was back at work, I would try to spend a few 41 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGWARD ROUNDSNorthwestern Medicine Through the YearsWRITTEN BY Will Doss IMAGES COURTESY OF Galter Health Sciences Library and Learning Center, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine NORTHWESTERN SURGEON JOHN B. MURPHY, MD, PLA YED A MAJOR ROLE IN MEDICAL \u2014 AND U.S. \u2014 HISTORY. 1895-1916 Murphy's Signheodore Roosevelt had a penchant for quips. One of his most memorable \u2014 \"It takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose\" \u2014 he offered in 1912 after being shot in the chest during a campaign event in Milwaukee. He then famously went on to deliver an 84-minute speech. What transpired afterward, however, is not as well-known and has a significant connection to Northwestern. A fter an examination at a Milwaukee hospital, Roosevelt was spirited away to Chicago's Mercy Hospital by John B. Murphy, MD. At the time, Murphy was chief of surgery at Mercy (Northwestern medical school's first teaching hospital) and chair of Northwestern's Department of Surgery. \"He t hought there weren't any good doctors in Milwaukee, so he insisted the President be transferred to Mercy and watched him there,\" said Karl Bilimoria, the John Benjamin Murphy Professor of Surgery and vice chair for quality in the Department of Surgery. After receiving his endowment name, Bilimoria took an intense interest in Murphy and when Mercy was sold to a private equity firm, he acquired a trove of the pioneering surgeon's academic and personal materials, and led the effort to Ttransfer the items to their new home in the Special Collections department of the Galter Health Sciences and Learning Center. In a ddition to caring for a sitting U.S. president, Murphy was the first to advocate for removing the appendix in the treatment of appendicitis and developed dozens of surgical and diagnostic techniques (several still bearing his name, including Murphy's sign, a test for differentiating pain in the abdomen). Along with acting as chief of surgery at Mercy from 1895 until his death in 1916, Murphy was president of the Chicago Medical Society, president of the American Medical Association, and a founder of the American College of Surgeons. On ce the collection is processed, Galter will host an exhibit about Murphy, including Bilimoria's contributions, items donated by Murphy's great granddaughter Barbara Miller in 2010, and other historic materials, according to Kristi Holmes, director of Galter (read more about Holmes on page 26). \"We are proud to house this wonderful collection,\" Holmes said. \"Dr. Murphy is an impressive figure in the medical school's history and we are delighted to help preserve and share his important legacy for future study and research.\"Top left: The rooms where former president Teddy Roosevelt stayed at Mercy Hospital, Chicago.
