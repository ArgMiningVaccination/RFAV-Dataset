Within our cells, we have personal defense systems ready to fight off any pathogens that arise; however, if our bodies are run down, our immune response can be suppressed. The blueprints to build a strong immunity are based mostly on getting good quality sleep, limiting stress, eating healthy foods, and drinking ample amounts of water. On top of this, there are many strategies you can adopt with supplementation to make your body's defense system even more robust. You can use micronutrients, adaptogens, probiotics, immune boosters, detox agents, Chinese herbs, and more. Below is a comprehensive list of my favorite supplements, along with proper doses to help boost your immune system and fight viruses. I recommend picking one or two supplements from each category for protection from viral infections. Please feel free to use the button below to order these supplements from my online pharmacy at 10% off MSRP. MICRONUTRIENTS VITAMIN C contributes to staying healthy by supporting the cellular functions of the immune system. It supports a barrier function against pathogens and promotes the healthy activity of the skin, which protects you from environmental oxidative stress. A high dose of 3000mg is recommended. In some, a dose this high can cause loose stools. If you find yourself having this issue take less until you have found a happy medium, it's best to take 1000mg three times a day. I recommend Bio-C-Plus by Biotics. VITAMIN D is linked to more robust immunity. Some scientists argue that people get sicker during winter because of less sun exposure. Studies show that people with higher Vitamin D are less likely to contract respiratory infections. The Coronavirus is showing to attack the respiratory system, so this makes Vitamin D even more crucial. It also can help you sleep better, which is a great way to build immunity. The recommended dose is 2000-6000 IU a day. I recommend Vitamin D Supreme by Designs for Health because it's a very high dose, and they include Vitamin K1 and K2, which helps with absorption. Try one pill in the morning and one pill in the evening. ZINC is a nutrient that people need to stay healthy. It helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses. Several doctor's studying Coronavirus (Covid-19) have found that lozenges and liquid zinc are effective at fighting off the illness before it enters the esophagus. Since the public is slowly discovering this, Zinc lozenges are harder to find, so I recommend you get whatever brand you can find locally. Zinc can lessen the effects of antibiotics, so make sure you ask your doctor about it if you are taking both. The recommended dose is between 8-11mg. MULTIVITAMINS are the most common recommendation I give to my patients. A good quality multivitamin covers so many bases because they include a high percentage of all the daily micronutrients that you need. There are endless benefits to a Multivitamin, including the full range of B vitamins that strengthen our brain and adrenal function as well as most other vitamins and minerals that our cells require. I recommend Phytomulti (without iron) by Metagenics. Two pills in the AM. The reason I suggest without iron is because iron can make people constipated, and one of the main principles of a robust immune system is to have regular healthy stools. ADAPTOGENS Adaptogens are herbal plants that help the body resist all kinds of stressors, including physical, chemical, and biological. These herbs and roots have been used for centuries in both Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines. Adaptogens strengthen adrenal function, which is a great way to increase immunity. Here are my two favorites: ADRENATONE by Designs for Health, which is a mix of Vitamins B1, B5, B6, C as well as Ashwagandha, Ginseng, Rhodiola, and more. The recommended dose is one pill three times a day. HPA AXIS: DAYTIME MAINTENANCE by Gaia herbs has similar apoptogenic herbs plus Schisandra Berry, Holy Basil, and Milky Oat seed, which makes it an excellent option for responding to biological stressors. The recommended dose is two pills twice a day. IMMUNE BOOSTERS While many of the suggestions discussed so far are intended to boost your immunity, there are products on the market that offer a mix of vitamins, mushrooms, and herbs to strengthen your immune response directly. Often these supplements are a mix of micronutrients, adaptogens, and other supportive immune boosters. Here are some of my favorites: LAURICIDIN - A form of Monolaurin (lauric acid) that embraces both your immune system and digestive tract. It fights off unwanted yeast and helps you build IgA and IgG, which is part of a healthy immune response. The optimal dose is one spoon three times a day, but its recommended to start slower and build it up in your system. Order directly from the manufacturer [here](https://www.lauricidin.com/professionals/1433-michelle-hirsch&utm_source=my.lauricidin.com&utm_medium=instore&utm_campaign=reorder). IMMUNE SHINE by Gaia is a powder blend that combines the benefits of mushrooms and other herbs to support a healthy immune system. It is made with Maitake and Chaga mushrooms mixed with Elderberry, Ginger, and Astragalus. Try 1-2 scoops a day. IMMUNITONE PLUS by Designs for Health contains herbs that support normal killer cell activity and the balance of cytokines, which are the regulatory proteins released by immune cells as part of a normal immune response. Immunitone Plus is a mix of adaptogens, lauric acid, and mushrooms. The recommended dose is four capsules a day. PROBIOTICS Building your gut flora is the most effective way to increase your immunity. As you increase your \"beneficial\" bacteria, you are sending your healthy troops to the front lines to fight off any infections that may sneak into your body. Both Chinese and Functional medicine have taught me that almost all health problems originate in the gut, and if you want to have a healthy body, focus on building a healthy gut. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeast that are good for you by keeping your gut healthy and increasing your immune response. There are three different groups of probiotics; Lactobacillus/Bifidobacteria probiotics, Soil based probiotics and Saccharomyces Boulardii probiotics and each have pros and cons. I recommend that people find the right probiotic for their body and take two doses throughout the day, one dose in the morning and one dose before bed. LACTOBACILLUS/BIFIDOBACTERIA are the most commonly distributed probiotics. They contain broad-spectrum live strains of Lactobacillus that are extremely helpful in building your beneficial gut bacteria. These are often found in refrigerated sections of stores. I recommend ProbioMed 50 by Designs for Health because it is shelf-stable so you do not need to keep it cold, which makes it easier for travel and pillboxes. Other than ProbioMed 50, there are so many amazing brands, and if you prefer to keep these refrigerated, I recommend you buy them locally to make sure it doesn't get exposed to too much heat during transport. The probiotics are widely available; however, they aren't typically good for people with SIBO or IBS. SOIL-BASED ORGANISMS are bacteria that live in soil. The sporulation phase of these bacteria is a potent probiotic because the bacteria are protected and can live through acidic environments of the stomach and upper intestines. This allows these forms of probiotics to travel to the lower intestine where they come alive and populate the gut with beneficial bacteria safely. I recommend Megasporebiotic by Microbiome. The advantage of soil-based organisms is that they have the best chance to populate your entire digestive tract, and the disadvantage is that they tend to be more expensive and sometimes harder to find. SACCHAROMYCES BOULARDII is a nonpathogenic, transient yeast long used to support healthy bowel transit time. It is a hardy, acid-resistant, and temperature tolerant microorganism that makes it successful at reaching large areas of the digestive system\u2014commonly used to treat diarrhea and other IBS issues. It also is the only probiotic that can work during a course of antibiotics since it is a yeast cell. Almost all supplement companies offer Saccharomyces Boulardii, and I don't have a favorite. Saccharomyces Boulardii is often the cheapest option of the three probiotics, but be careful if you have sensitivities to yeast and fungus. DETOX AGENTS Detoxification is the physiological removal of toxic substances from our bodies, mostly through our liver. If we are not detoxing well, toxins stay in our bodies, and it's much easier to get sick. Maintaining healthy detox pathways is a great way to keep your immunity healthy. We detox through sweat, urine, and stools, so it's always best to drink tons of water, exercise, and make sure you have a healthy bowel movement every day. Either of the following options are excellent supplements to help increase your detox abilities and help you stay healthy: N-ACETYL-CYSTEINE (NAC) gives your body a big antioxidant boost as it helps protect your lungs from free radicals. It also helps ensure that you have sufficient levels of glutathione. NAC also helps your lungs get rid of thick mucus and chest congestion, which can be symptoms of the novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). I like to use NAC by Designs for Health because they have large bottles and an option of 900mg pills. The dose is 500-2000mg per day. GLUTATHIONE is a molecule consisting of the amino acid building blocks glutamine, glycine, and cysteinene and is naturally made in the liver when we are healthy. It protects the liver tissues while supporting phase 2 detoxification through promoting the removal of toxins through waste products like stool and bile. Increasing your glutathione can significantly help you detoxify and strengthen your immune system. I recommend Liposomal Glutathione by Designs for Health or Quicksilver Scientific because it is the most natural form to absorb. The dose is one pill a day. Once again, let me be clear that you do not have to take all of these suggested supplements to strengthen your immune system. You could consider one or two from each category and be thoroughly prepared. Try a multivitamin with extra vitamin C and D, immune booster with adaptogens, a probiotic and NAC. This is the strategy I take with most of my patients. Functional medicine is fascinating and uses many cutting-edge tests that measure deficiencies in your body.
