His research addresses the implementation of health policy and clinical practice, in particular the evaluation of vaccination and other public health strategies to minimise the burden of childhood infectious diseases. This work integrates clinical trials with case-control and cohort studies and disease modelling. His current work is investigating how best to prevent and treat gastroenteritis, pneumonia, pertussis and other lower respiratory infections, and congenital rubella. Tom was awarded a Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) grant from NHMRC earlier this year and leads this Bayesian Evidence-Adaptive Trial to optimise management of cystic fibrosis. His work has a strong focus on Aboriginal and international child health. He is also investigating the safety of vaccination in early childhood. - [Projects](#) - [Publications](#)November 2015 [Whither pertussis?](/our-research/reports-and-findings/2015/november/whither-pertussis/) This article discusses the rising prevalence of pertussis disease in countries which have switched to acellular vaccines.
