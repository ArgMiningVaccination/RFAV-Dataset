While I agree that vaccines are not THE cause of autism, there is no doubt that vaccines can create a situation in a child that can make them more susceptible to a cascade of events that can lead to major problems...not just autism. Autism is one of the more severe issues that can occur in the mixture of a immature immune system with chemicals that are way too powerful for THAT PARTICULAR CHILD to handle. But other challenges can be a result, ones that may not show up as immediately as Autism. What about the other \"A\" disorders? Asperger's and ADD/ADHD to start. How about Allergies and Asthma? With the exception of ear infections, those 5 \"A\" disorders are amongst the most common health issues we are seeing in today's kids. Do I mean to imply that these 5 \"A\" disorders are somehow related? Autism, Asperger's, ADD/ADHD, Allergies and Asthma? Yes, and I am not alone in this thinking. Check out this book, my favorite in the league of new information coming out about linking these problems together: Healing the New Childhood Epidemics: Autism, ADHD, Asthma, and Allergies: The Groundbreaking Program for the 4-A Disorders. Dr Bock, the author, doesn't include Asperger's which is on the \"Autistic spectrum\" as it is called. His book does a great job describing the problem and tackling some of the main issues, like diet and supplementation. He omits chiropractic care which I have found to be critically important in getting these kids to the next level, and doesn't include rehabilitative exercises, also a must with children in the 5 \"A\" category. Another great book is Disconnected Kids: The Groundbreaking Brain Balance Program for Children with Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, and Other Neurological Disorders. Dr Melillo is a chiropractor with a specialty degree in neurology. He talks about how kids with Autism and ADHD have brains and body's that are in a way \"disconnected.\" The left sides and right sides of the brain and hence the body do not communicate very well with each other, and hence the child cannot function at his/her optimum. He calls it \"Functional Disconnection Syndrome\", and is very big into rehab exercises and dietary modification. Several months ago an article came out in the AJC, \"Settlement Reached in Autism-Vaccine Case.\" It was the first case in which a child was awarded a monetary settlement due to proof that the child's autism was in part caused by the vaccine. Just so happened that the child's father was an MD who did his own research after all this happened and wrote 2 articles in the Journal of Child Neurology proving his case. Dr. John Shoffner's main thesis was that in certain children who have a genetic disorder that may not have been identified prior to vaccination, the vaccine may trigger an event that he calls \"autistic regression with fever.\" Check out the article at http://jcn.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/09/22/0883073809342128.abstract. All in all, the issue we are dealing with here is what we would call \"Roulette\". You cannot KNOW FOR CERTAIN how a child or adult will react to any given drug or vaccine at any given time, even if they appeared fine during prior exposures. The suggestion is to think twice before everything you do, especially when related to health care. Will whatever suggested course of treatment or even examination have more positive benefits by doing it than negative ones by not doing it? A patient a few years ago told me about his neighbor's child that went in for MINOR ear tube surgery and DIED because of a reaction to the anesthesia. Risk vs. benefit must always be played out. Think twice, and have a happier, healthier New Year!
