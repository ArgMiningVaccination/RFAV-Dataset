In actuality, bone broth has been around for centuries, used in traditional cultures and by trained chefs worldwide. Somehow this ancient tradition became a lost practice in newer generations. But luckily it is making a comeback! What our ancestors knew instinctively is that bone broth is rich in several nutrients and has many health benefits. Nutrients in Bone Broth This rich, flavorful drink is not only easy to digest but nutrient-dense as well. Here is a list of some of the nutrients you will find in bone broth. Easily absorbed forms of key minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Phosphorus, Silicon, Sulphur and more. As electrolytes, some of these minerals are necessary for proper muscle and nerve function as well as keeping your body hydrated. These minerals are also important for a resilient immune system, strong bones, healthy heart, optimal digestion and improved detoxification. 19 amino acids including all nine essential amino acids. These building blocks for proteins help build and repair muscle tissue, support bone mineral density, boost nutrient absorption and synthesis, maintain connective tissue health, improve skin elasticity, regulate blood sugar, and heal the gut lining. Additionally, research has shown the amino acid glycine may reduce fatigue and improve sleep. Another key amino acid, L-glutamine has been found to reduce certain types of bacteria in the gut called Firmicutes which may aid in weight loss. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. These compounds are typically sold in supplement form to treat joint pain and protect joints. Bone broth contains both of these compounds and can be a less expensive way to reduce inflammation, support cartilage to protect joints and decrease joint pain. Collagen. Collagen is an amazing compound that positively effects many aspects of health. It helps strengthen tendons and ligaments to promote joint health. It improves skin elasticity which can reduce fine lines and wrinkles and decrease puffiness. Collagen can help heal damage to the gut lining, repairing leaky gut syndrome and improving digestive health. It has also been reported that collagen may improve cellulite. Glutathione. This compound is a very strong antioxidant so it helps maintain a healthy immune system as well as reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Studies also show it plays important roles in nutrient metabolism, regulating gene expression, and normalizing DNA and protein synthesis. Glutathione is a compound used in Phase 2 detoxification so it is also necessary for removing toxins from the body. Hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is found in connective, skin and nerve tissue. It supports cell rejuvenation, enhances skin firmness and promotes healthy aging. Benefits of Bone Broth As you can see, bone broth has a whole host of nutrients that are promoting health in many ways. Here is a quick breakdown of all the benefits you receive from drinking bone broth. Enhance immune function Strengthen bones and teeth Support cartilage and protect joints Build and repair muscles Improve skin elasticity and reduce signs of aging Regulate blood sugar Heal gut lining and repair leaky gut syndrome Improve digestion and overcome food intolerances and allergies Decrease IBS, Chrohn's, ulcerative colitis and acid reflux symptoms Reduce fatigue and improve sleep Boost nutrient absorption Support detoxification Decrease inflammation and joint pain Reduce appearance of cellulite Support a balanced microbiota Lose and maintain weight Bone Broth v. Stock The typical chicken broth or stock on your grocery store shelves is not the same as traditional bone broth. Standard broth is typically made with mostly meat and possibly a small amount of bones and simmered for a short time, 45 minutes to 2 hours. Stock is made with mostly bones and a small amount of meat (whatever sticks to the bones) and the bones are usually roasted before being simmered for 3 to 4 hours. Bone broth is similar to stock in that it contains mostly bones with a small amount of meat and typically roasted first. But the main difference is that bone broth is simmered for a very long time - 24 to 48 hours. It is the long cooking time that allows as many minerals and nutrients to be removed from the bone and into the broth. In fact, the bones in your broth have been leached of nutrients so much they should crumble when pressed lightly. Making Your Own Bone Broth There are three important things to consider when making your own bone broth. First, choose bones from organic, grass-fed animals at your local farmers market or butcher to ensure the animal was not treated with antibiotics or fed genetically modified foods. Second, choose the boniest bones you can find - beef knuckles, chicken necks, oxtails, and chicken feet - to obtain the most nutrients from your finished broth. Third, add an acid like apple cider vinegar to the cooking process to help leach out the minerals from the bones. Here is a simple Bone Broth recipe: Ingredients 2-4lb bones 2 large carrots, chopped 2 celery stalks, chopped 1 onion, chopped 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar Roast bones at 350\u00b0F for 30 minutes. When done roasting, place bones and any drippings in a large pot, cover with water, sprinkle with vinegar and let sit for 20-30 minutes. Place pot on stovetop, add veggies and bring to boil. Once boiling, bring down to simmer. For first 2-4 hours of simmering, watch every 20-30 minutes and skim any scum off the top. Simmer for 24 hours (chicken bones) to 48 hours (beef bones). Let cool. A layer of fat will harden on top, this is protecting the broth underneath. If you do not want to eat the fat as well, discard it only when you are about to eat the broth. Once you've made your broth you can drink it in a mug as a warm drink (it takes like rich chicken soup), use it as a base for gravy/sauce or soups/stews, cook veggies in it, or even dehydrate it to make your own bouillon powder. It is also freezer friendly. However you choose to eat or drink your bone broth, know that you are optimizing your health with each "}
