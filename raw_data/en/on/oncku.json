Spring cleaning is synonymous with an annual heavy duty cleaning or de-cluttering. While the efforts that go into this task are often tiring, the result of getting organized gives one a feeling of accomplishment. Cleaning doesn't seem like an obvious way to reduce stress, but keeping your surroundings less cluttered and more organized is a standard time management tool. Where did I put that document? Where are my keys? Which folder has the e-mail about the new policy? A little spring reorganization can make you more efficient and reduce frustration. Once you do the initial organization, the key is to use a system to keep things straight. Jim Kendall, Manager of Work/Life Connections offers the following suggestions: 1.Daily to-do lists and scheduling systems (day planners or electronic devices) are useful in keeping track of regularly scheduled appointments, tasks, projects, and deadlines. They also serve as a map for what you want to get accomplished today, this week, and this month. Review it first thing each day and when you end the day. David Allen's book Getting Things Done: The art of stress-free productivity or Stephen Covey's First Things First , outline prac - tical methods for organizing your life. 2.Handle papers and e-mails once.Try TRAF , which stands for Toss It; Refer It (Pass it along); Act on it; File it is based on the book Organize for Success by Stephanie Winston. 3.Set up desktop and e-mail folders and files for saving things you aren't ready to part with just yet. Clean out your e-mail inbox monthly. 4.Spend your energy on those tasks that yield a greater impact toward your goals. Take con - trol of this resource and allocate it. 5.Don't forget to budget time for self-care and enjoying life's special moments. Make room in your schedule for exercise, sleep, quiet time, socializing, and hobbies. If you have trouble taking care of yourself, consider reading Self-Nurture: Learning to Care for Yourself as Effectively as you Care for Everyone Else by Alice D. Domar and Henry Dreher. 6.Throw things away that you haven't used in several years. Simplify. There will be a couple of things you wish you had kept, but most of it you will never miss. Pam Brown, Director of the Vanderbilt Organizational Effectiveness Team, suggests controlling TV time. \"In the evening and on weekends, limit your television watching to programs that you truly enjoy. If possible, record shows and save them until you've completed other tasks.\" She also adds, \" Reward yourself when you've completed a task \u2014 identify non-food rewards Traci Nordberg Associate Vice Chancellor, Chief Human Resource Officer Leading by example Vanderbilt Leaders Making Wellness a Priority Providing programs that support the health and productivity of Vanderbilt's most valuable asset...

I am thinking I would be happier in a different career, relationship, and city. But when I think about change, I just feel overwhelmed and do nothing. How can I get past this inertia? Stuck in Nashville A: Dear Stuck, It is easy to feel overwhelmed when you think so many areas of your life aren't working. Why not try this approach. 1. Make a list of all the things about your job, relation - ships, and Nashville that you perceive are not working. 2. Then imagine and write down what life would be like in a year if things were going well. Where would you be? Who would you be with? What would you be doing? 3. Create a list of action steps that can lead you to your vision of the future. Sometimes just focusing on one area you would like to change and taking those steps will create a ripple effect and make the other areas less unsatisfying. If you need help with this process or continue to feel stuck I would suggest you meet with a counselor.

The above physical activity data for Tennessee and the US are from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a national telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments. The BRFSS physical activity questions attempt to measure a person's physical activity in leisure-time. The data from Vanderbilt is from individuals that reported exercising > 1 day a week on the Health Risk Assessment. Vanderbilt continues to be ahead of both Tennessee and the United States for leisure time activities, such as running, dancing, gardening, or walking. Research has demonstrated that individuals that move from being com - pletely sedentary to being physically active even one day a week can make a significant difference in their health.

Dealing with allergies Seasonal allergies affect 35.9 million Americans. Although it is impossible to avoid allergy triggers altogether, there are ways to help minimize issues. Do a thorough spring cleaning. Wipe windows, bookshelves, and air conditioning vents that collected dust and mold. Delay early morning outdoor activities. Pollens are usually released between 5 and 10 a.m. Know your local pollen count. (National Allergy Bureau Website: www.aaaai.org/nab ). If possible, use air conditioning instead of opening windows. When traveling in a car, keep windows up and the air conditioning on. Stay indoors on hot, dry, and windy days when allergens get stirred up. Don't hang your laundry out to dry. Allergens can collect on it. When mowing the lawn or raking leaves, wear a filter mask. Wash bedding weekly in hot water. Shower and wash your hair every night. Remove visible mold using non-toxic cleaning products such as undiluted vinegar or lemon juice mixed with a pinch of salt. Pay attention to high mold spore counts after heavy rains or in the evening.

A: Yes! Vending machines are infamous for the types of products they offer: chips, cookies, candies, candy bars, sodas, etc. Take a second glance and you will notice that certain vending machines sell trail mixes, peanuts, nuts, pretzels, and baked chips. Although these foods are \"snack-size,\" they still may be high in fat and sugar and contribute large amounts of calories without contributing many nutrients. Many are high in fat and sometimes con - tain saturated and trans fats. These fats are related to heart disease, obesity, and other chronic diseases and they should be lim - ited. High amounts of sugar are also found in candies and sodas. Calories from these sweet treats easily add up. Look for items that pack a nutritious punch. Here are some tips for your next trip to the vending machine: Choose nutrient-rich items such as baked chips, raisins, pretzels, nuts, and seeds. Limit foods high in fat such as candy bars, potato chips, pastries, etc. Limit sugary foods like candies, cookies, and sodas. Try packing healthy options from home.

For many people, the time in between can be filled with raiding the refrigerator for a little something extra. When hunger strikes in the evening, it can be tempting to dig into a favorite snack. But some foods can interfere with a good night's sleep and have the potential to derail a healthful eating plan. Here are a few snacks that won't dis - turb your sleep or your healthy diet: Like to chomp on potato chips? Go for sea - soned, air-popped popcorn or a handful of nuts instead. Sweet tooth need satisfying? Try fresh rasp - berries, blueberries, strawberries, and melon. Tend to be a scoop-of-ice-cream type? Consider fat-free yogurt or low-fat cottage cheese with fresh fruit such as pineapple.

What is The Week of the Young Child? It is a week-long program that focuses attention on the rights and needs of young children, and raises awareness about community resources that promote their healthy development. The Week of the Young Child 2011 will be April 9 -16. Why should I get involved in The Week of the Young Child, and how should I take action? Good health habits start early; the early years are the most formative in a child's life. Model healthy eating and active living habits and remember that families that eat meals together tend to be healthier. Make sure your child gets plenty of exercise and good, age appropriate nutrition. Also, be sure to register to vote and let your voice be heard for children. Last, insist that all children and families have access to quality child care and health care. What activities will be available for families during Nashville's Week of the Young Child? There will be a variety of activities, including: Saturday, April 9 Toad-ly Awesome Amphibians Celebrate frogs, toads, and salamanders through crafts, stories, games, and a scavenger hunt from 9:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. at Warner Park Nature Center.

Here are some things to keep in mind: Consider the source. Use recognized authorities. Is it the federal govern - ment, a nonprofit institution, a professional organization, a health system, a commercial organization, or an individual? Focus on quality. Does the site have an editorial board? Is the information reviewed? Be a skeptic. Does the site make health claims that seem too good to be true? Promise quick, dramatic, miraculous results? Is it the only site making these claims? Look for evidence. Rely on medical research, not opinion. Look for the author of the information, either an individual, or an organization. Check for currency. Is the informa - tion current? Look for dates on documents. Beware of bias. What is the pur - pose? Who is providing the funding? Who pays for the site?

The new Dietary Guidelines for Americans recom - mend limiting salt intake to about one teaspoon of salt daily (2300 mg sodium). If you are 51 and older, African American, or have high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease your limit is even lower (half a teaspoon, or 1500 mg sodium daily). Here are some tips to help you put down that salt shaker. 1. Cook at home instead of eating out. Remove salt from recipes whenever possible. Add flavor to your meals with spices and seasonings other than salt, such as black pepper, basil, lemon, garlic, onions, and herbs. 2. Rely on fresh foods instead of processed or frozen foods. Most of our daily sodium intake comes from processed foods. Opt for fruits, veggies, low-fat dairy products, and lean cuts of meat and poultry. 3. Read food labels to choose foods lower in sodium. Go for low-, reduced-, or no-salt-added foods. Select foods with less than 5% daily value for sodium. 4. Rehydrate yourself with water and low-sodium soft drinks. Energy drinks and some sodas often contain large amounts of added sodium. 5. Do not touch that salt shaker. Avoid adding salt to food at the table. Better still, remove the salt shaker from the table. 6. Cut back slowly. Your taste for salt is acquired over time. It takes a while for your taste buds to adjust to lower sodium. Reduce the amount of salt in your cooking a little each day until no salt add-ons are used. 7. Be careful with salt substitutes. Talk to your health-care provider before adopting salt substitutes. Some salt substitutes are rich in potassium and could be unsafe for certain people. 8. Try out the DASH diet. If you have a tendency toward developing high blood pressure the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet may be the way to go. The DASH diet is low in salt and saturated fat and rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products. Cutting down on sodium is a proven way to help control your blood pressure. Read the newly released Dietary Guidelines for Americans at http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines .Caring for caregivers If you have a friend, family member, or co-worker who is a caregiver, you may want to consider: Offering to take the caregiver out for dinner and a movie Being a shoulder to cry on Taking over the grocery shopping every other week or once a month Mowing the lawn or shoveling the snow Coordinating a volunteer team to help with specific caregiving tasks Making sure to call every week just to check in Researching resources that may help Helping with insurance and other paperwork Taking the child or aging parent out for a few hours so the caregiver can relax at home Letting the caregiver know when you're available and what you can do in case a need arises If you are a caregiver, you may want to: Take time for yourself and your other family members.
