Hair loss, although a natural part of the aging process, is often a cause for concern. The profound symbolic and psychosocial importance attached to hair is reflected by the anxiety and distress resulting from its loss [3](#B3). Cash and colleagues [4](#B4)assessed the psychological effects of hair loss on women by comparing them with balding men and female control subjects. They confirmed the potentially adverse psychosocial sequelae of this common dermatological condition. [4](#B4). [5](#B5). Experimental animal models such as mice, rats, rabbits, sheep and monkeys have been used to evaluate the extent of hair growth [6](#B6) [7](#B7) [8](#B8) [9](#B9). The mouse model, such as the C3H/HeJ mouse, is one of the most widely used animal model reported for testing hair growth products, despite the disadvantages presented by its higher hair density and wave pattern of hair cycle progression [10](#B10) [11](#B11) [12](#B12). Cotsarelis [13](#B13)demonstrated that in a given person, both the bald areas and the normal scalp had the same number of stem cells. It has also been reported that hair follicles of the alopecic scalp lack progenitor cells. This implies a defect in the activation of stem cells to progenitor cells in the bald scalp. It is known that hair follicles do not disappear in alopecia, they just decrease in size. In order to generate terminal hair, researchers have emphasized the need to identify factors that, when used topically, may convert stem cells into progenitor cells [13](#B13). [7](#B7) [14](#B14). The purpose of the current study was to compare the efficacy of three chemical treatments used in hair loss patients, namely, 2% minoxidil, Hairgrow (Dar Al Dawa Pharma, Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine, France), and Kerium, Anti-chute (La Roche-Posay, Madrid, Spain). We aimed at determining the differences in hair regrowth induced by the three hair promoting agents in a rat model and to assess the results of treatment by using trichoscopy, hair weight examination, and morphometry, to identify the product with the best results from among the three. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental animals and study design [15](#B15). They were randomly assigned to four groups, with each group consisting of eight rats. Prior to shaving the rats, general anesthesia was administered with a combination of ketamine (intraperitoneal 50 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (20 mg/kg body weight). On the first day of the experiment, fur from two rectangular areas (2\u00d74 cm each), situated on either sides of the spine was removed by using an animal shaving machine. Shaved area on the left side of the spine was defined as the control area was left untreated. The right side was defined as the test area for application of products to be tested. [Table 1](#T1)). Rats in groups I to III received 0.3 ml of hair promoting agent (product) applied topically for 28 days. A syringe plunger was used to apply the product on the test area. Animals were isolated for half an hour after topical application and then housed back to their cages. The rats in the last group (IV) served as control subjects and received no treatment during the experiment. On day 29, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and then evaluated. Evaluation of hair regrowth efficacy Trichoscopic visualization of test areas Hair weight assessment Measurement of skin thickness and number of hair follicles Statistical analysis RESULTS Hair regrowth evaluation by trichoscopy [Fig. 1](#F1)). Treatment with 2% minoxidil was considered as the gold standard and the in vivo hair regrowth induced by it was compared with the results achieved with Aminexil and Kerium therapy in addition to the comparisons involving control areas and the control group. The hair regrowth noticed in group II (Aminexil) and group III (Kerium) was lesser than that seen in groups I (minoxidil) or IV (controls). When evaluated with trichoscopy, the rats from these two groups had type 1 pattern of hair growth (uneven hair growth on tested area) and type 2 pattern of hair growth (low hair density) ( [Fig. 2](#F2), [3](#F3)). Additionally, both Aminexil and Kerium treated areas had a lower hair regrowth effect when compared to control group (group IV). [Fig. 3](#F3)). Rats in group I had better hair regrowth than the rats in groups II (Aminexil) and III ( [Fig. 2](#F2), [3](#F3)). [3](#F3)). Hair weight assessment [Table 2](#T2)). Hair weight from test areas was significantly higher than from the negative control area when compared in the same animal in group I (minoxidil) and group II (Kerium) (p<0.05). The highest hair weight was recorded in the Kerium treated rats. The hair regrowth stimulation with 2% minoxidil was significantly better than the hair regrowth in negative controls (group IV) (p<0.001). Aminexil topical treatment (group II) had the least regrowth effect as compared to all other experimental groups ( [Table 2](#T2)). Histopathological examination of hair regrowth (morphometric assessment) [Table 3](#T3)). After 4 weeks of topical treatment in group I (minoxidil 2%) an increase in the number of hair follicles (p<0.05 as compared to control area) was noticed in the subcutaneous layer, the majority of which were in the anagen phase and a few in the catagen phase ( 3](#T3), [Fig. 4](#F4)). the follicle count in the subcutaneous layer was very low, suggesting that Aminexil induced less hair regrowth. In group II, the anagen induction in the treated areas had similar values as the control areas implying that regrowth was not enhanced by Aminexil treatment 4](#F4)). The percentage of induction was significantly increased following topical application of Kerium in group III (p<0.05 as compared two Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved hair loss drugs are available for medical management of hair loss: the dihydrotestosterone- suppressing 5 alfa-reductase inhibitor, [18](#B18). Both finasteride and minoxidil are commonly used clinical practice. Since finasteride and minoxidil (2% or 5%) have temporary effects and unpredictable efficacy, better pharmacological options for treatment are necessary for managing hair loss [19](#B19). [20](#B20). Several agents advertised as effective \"anti-hair loss\" remedies are not supported by convincing studies. This is the reason why \"great expectations\" turn into plenty of disappointments [21](#B21). Much of those disappointments appear to result from inefficient drug action and insufficient assessment of the basic pathology of hair loss [22](#B22). There is also lack of studies regarding the mechanism of action of human hair growth promoters [20](#B20). [19](#B19) [23](#B23). The main mesenchymal component, the dermal papilla plays an important role in inducting new hair follicles and maintaining hair growth [24](#B24). To pass from the resting phase to the anagen phase, the DP cells demonstrate increased cell division and growth rate. This passage, therefore, requires a good supply of nutrients and a toxin-free environment for the growing cells. If these requirements are not fulfilled, the follicles fail to pass from the resting phase (telogen) to the growing phase (anagen) [25](#B25). [26](#B26). [21](#B21) [22](#B22). The treatment needs one application every day for a minimum of 3 applications every week, by using one of the two adapted applicators (for men and women). [7](#B7). According to our results, minoxidil 2% and Kerium treatment contributed to the increase in the number of hair follicles observed in the subcutaneous layer (p<0.05 as compared to the control area), with the majority being in the anagen phase. Similar results were not observed with Aminexil, suggesting that it did not have the same beneficial effects on hair regrowth. Trichoscopy demonstrated that the best hair regrowth was achieved with 2% minoxidil, with treated rats developing type 3 and type 4 patterns of hair regrowth (moderate to high hair density) on test areas. [27](#B27). In our study, the statistically significant anagen induction (p<0.05) was not accompanied by increase in skin thickness. [18](#B18). Since then, minoxidil has been marketed under many trade names. Minoxidil slows or stops hair loss and promotes hair growth by a mechanism that is still uncertain. Since the telogen phase follicles are shed and are replaced by new anagen hairs, it is possible that minoxidil acts as a nitric oxide agonist. Minoxidil is a potassium channel opener, causing hyperpolarization of cell membranes, thus allowing more oxygen, blood and nutrients to reach the follicle [28](#B28). Minoxidil is also a vasodilator and increases the cutaneous blood flow to the scalp Minoxidil dyhydrotestosterone (DHT) the enzyme responsible for accumulation of DHT around the hair follicle, ruling out the therapeutic action of minoxidil on the hormonal or genetic causes of hair loss. Minoxidil is administered topically and is available in two concentrations: 2% and 5% [30](#B30). [17](#B17). Studies suggest ceasing of hair regrowth and onset of hair loss in 30 to 60 days if minoxidil treatment is stopped for more than 6 months [30](#B30). This happens because without the beneficial environment created by minoxidil, the follicles return to their primary condition, and are exposed to DHT resulting in their shrinkage and destruction. Minoxidil must be used indefinitely for continuous support of existing hair follicles and maintenance of the experienced hair regrowth, if any. [31](#B31)studied hair growth promoters, minoxidil, diazoxide, and Cooper peptides, on fuzzy rats. Their results with minoxidil demonstrated a conversion of short vellus hairs to prolonged terminal hairs. They also noticed an enlargement of the follicular size with prolongation of anagen phase due to an enhanced rate of cell proliferation. "}
