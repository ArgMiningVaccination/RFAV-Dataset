European regulators expect to make a decision on whether BioNTech/Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine should be used on kids as young as 5 by early November. European Medicines Agency members told reporters Thursday that they expect BioNTech/Pfizer to submit data from pediatric trials in early October, and it should take approximately four weeks to make a recommendation unless the agency needs more information. Moderna should submit its data a month later in early November. BioNTech/Pfizer [published](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/20/pfizer-biontech-say-covid-19-shot-for-kids-is-safe-and-provokes-strong-immune-response-512930) a press release earlier this week saying two smaller doses of the vaccine in kids between 5 and 11 years old proved to be comparable to the response seen from two full doses in teens. Experts, however, [criticized](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/20/pfizer-biontech-say-covid-19-shot-for-kids-is-safe-and-provokes-strong-immune-response-512930) the companies for not publishing the full data on the vaccine this week and for including too few kids in the trials. The EMA today did not answer a question about whether it too were concerned about the size of the pediatric trials.

It stopped short of critiquing any countries that have already rolled out booster doses to their general populations. Fergus Sweeney, the EMA's head of clinical trials, reiterated that countries are able to make decisions based on their individual coronavirus situations. \"[Countries] have to take account of the broader domain of the different waves of disease, the different vaccines they have available and how they want to protect the members of their public,\" he said. The EMA will make a recommendation based on the evidence, but countries \"can take a broader view and have the competence to.\" Beyond vaccines, the agency said it should meet the Commission's target of [making a decision on five](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/communication-strategy-covid-19-therapeutics_en.pdf) potential COVID-19 therapies by the end of the year. There are [four monocolonal antibodies](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/treatments-vaccines/treatments-covid-19/covid-19-treatments-under-evaluation) in the \"mature stage of assessment,\" which could be approved by the end of October or early November, Marco Cavaleri, the EMA's head of vaccine strategy, said. Three immunomodulatory agents under review will be discussed in October. \"It should be possible to conclude very soon,\" Cavaleri said, \"and by the end of the year, for sure.\"This article is part of POLITICO's premium policy service: Pro Health Care.
