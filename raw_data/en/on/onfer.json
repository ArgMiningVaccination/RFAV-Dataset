Under BARDA's Clinical Studies Network (CSN), Allucent will initiate and implement a 10,000-participant Phase IIb clinical trial. The research is designed to evaluate the relative efficacy of next-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidates compared to approved/authorized COVID-19 vaccines to prevent symptomatic, PCR-confirmed [SARS-CoV-2](https://globalbiodefense.com/tag/sars-cov-2/) infection. Next-generation COVID-19 vaccines could expand the breadth of coverage against existing and future variants, extend the duration of protection, and offer better protection in preventing illness and transmission over the current state of vaccine technologies.
