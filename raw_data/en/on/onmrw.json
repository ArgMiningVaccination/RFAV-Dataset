The spreading of industrialization, urbanization has putted bad impact upon our environment. - The pollution level is increasing day by day at every level in air, water and even in our foods. - We are living in such an environment which is filled with various pollutants, dusts, pollens, , various bacteria, viruses, some strong smells, strong fumes etc. - We are eating various types of foods contains different types of proteins. Among them commons are milk protein, whey protein, egg protein etc. - The water what we drink also contain various types useful as well as harmful substance. - When all those above things are get inside to our body, our body's immune system recognize them and differentiate them which are harmful and which harmless for our body and destroy the harmful ones. - But sometimes many harmless substances act as harmful for some people and their immune system reacts an abnormal reaction or increased sensitivity to certain substances, - It is because the body's immune system of allergic people is very hypersensitive to these substances call allergen when comes in contact with them. - The allergic individual create a special type of antibody call Immunoglobin E(Ige), when comes contact with the environmental substances. The reaction between IgE antibodies and allergen, it release huge amount of substances such as histamine, which produce allergic symptoms in skin, nose, eyes, chest, etc. The allergic reaction can be occurred at any place at anywhere. - The most common allergens are animal dander, pollens, house dust, house mites, moulds, some drugs, and many food stuffs, especially fish, eggs, milk, and nuts. Bee and wasp stings may cause allergic reactions, with fatal results in rare cases. Additionally, feathers, wood, dyes, cosmetics, and perfumes may act as allergen. Understand How Body Immune system reacts to an allergy: - The immune system is your body's defense system against all those foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, various foreign substances. These agents are called antigens. - The immune system consists of various immune cells and tissues that works together constantly and consistently to keep you healthy and alive. - WBC or White blood cells act as your main defense against these antigens. - The lymphocyte of white blood cells is one of the important cell plays a major role in allergic reaction. - There are more than 2 trillion lymphocytes in your blood stream at a time - Two major types of lymphocytes, the T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes involve fully in all allergic reaction of body. - The T cells and B cells travels everywhere in your body. They pass across the blood vessels walls and moves in the inter cellular space and roam around. - The T cell when find an antigen gets activated and produce some chemical messenger called cytokines. Those cytokines activate the other lymphocyte B cell to convert the plasma cell. - The plasma cell produces the antibodies IgE. The peoples who have an allergic constitution produce more IgE antibodies. - There are mast cells present throughout the body, especially beneath the surface of the skin, near blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, within nerves, throughout the respiratory system, and in the digestive and urinary tracts. - A mast cell is a type of white blood cell contains many granules rich in histamine, inflammatory mediators. - The IgE antibodies that are released from the plasma cell binds to the Fc receptors present on the surface of mast cells - The binding of IgE antibody to the mast cell causes the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators in the surrounding tissue. - Those histamine granules when come in contact with the tissue surface initiate the inflammatory reaction. So as a result the symptoms of sneezing, running nose, congestion of eyes are occurred. The inflammatory reaction also constricts the bronchial airways so creates difficulties in breathimg. The Most Common Trigger Factor and symptoms for Allergy: The allergic symptoms are developed within a few minutes to hour of being exposed to the things somebody is allergic to.

Various allergic symptoms like - Coughing - Nasal congestion - Skin rash - Wheezing - Ear infection - Sinus infection TYPES OF ALLERGY There are major 3 category of allergy- Respiratory tract and throat allergy - the respiratory tract and throat allergies are- - Allergic rhinitis:- Allergic rhinitis is an allergic inflammation of the nasal airways. It occurs when an allergen, such as pollen, dust or animal dander is inhaled by an individual with a sensitized immune system. It causes sneezing, itchy and watery eyes, swelling and inflammation of the nasal passages, and an increase in mucus production. Many of the same factors that trigger allergic rhinitis can also trigger an allergic bronchial asthma attack. - Rhinosinusitis -rhino sinusitis is the inflammation of inner layer of nasal passage and inner lining of sinus cavity result from allergic cause or viral cause. the common cause for developing of rhino sinusitis is allergy i.e. allergic rhinitis. the most common symptoms of rhinosinusitis are blocking of nose, heaviness and severe pain on sinus areas like at the side on root of nose, both side of nose just under the eyes, and on maxilla portion of face. there sometimes more nasal secretion of thin to thick discharges - Allergic Bronchial Asthma - It is the common chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. It is triggered by various allergens or irritants. In allergic asthma, when the airways come in contact with an allergen, the immune system reacts and releases chemicals. These chemicals cause the muscles around the airways to tighten. Inflammation, swelling, and a buildup of mucus in the airways causes further narrowing. - Allergic tonsillitis and adenoids - Tonsils are the two round lumps in the back of the throat. Tonsils can be seen clearly in the back of the throat, while the adenoids are located high in the throat behind the nose and the roof of the mouth (soft palate) and are not visible. Those are the lymph glands like other lymph gland. The inflammation of tonsils and adenoids are called tonsillitis and adenoids. the common symptoms occurs in tonsillitis are sore throat, can not swallow any thing because of throat pain, sometimes redness of tonsils, cough , fever etc. The adenoids symptoms are snoring, sleeping disorder, weakness feeling etc. - Nasal polyp: nasal polyps are non cancerous grape shaped growths found around the nasal mucus membrane especially at the place where the sinus opens to the nasal passage. They result from chronic inflammation due to allergy, asthma, recurring infection or certain immune disorder. The common symptoms are blocked stuffy nose, post nasal drip, runny nose, loss of smell, pain in maxillary portion, etc. Skin allergy - The skin allergy can be of - urticaria or hives - Urticaria or hives is a skin reaction of appearance of various sizes smooth, slightly elevated pinkish patches of wheals like attended with severe itching result from allergic reaction. Those are subsided automatically after a few minutes to hour without leaving any scar. Most cases of urticaria are self-limited and of short duration. Chronic urticaria is defined as urticaria with recurrent episodes lasting longer than 6 weeks. - Atopic dermatitis or Eczema - atopic dermatitis or eczema is one type of inflammation of skin characterize with itchy, redness , rough and cracked skin patches result from allergic cause. they may be wet and oozing of sticky watery fluid from that affected part. G.I. Tract allergy - Gastro enteritis - There is abdominal pain, nausea and loose bowel movement generally occur in child and babies. Factors that can increase your risk for developing allergies include the following: - Have a family history of asthma or allergies - children are more susceptible - Cigarette smoke. - Births during high-pollen seasons. Those babies born during high-pollen seasons may be more sensitive to hay fever allergens later in life. - Allergen exposure. Early exposure to allergens like mold, pollen, dust mites, pet dander, cockroaches, and some types of food seems to increase your risk of developing allergies. - Being a bottle-fed baby. Studies show that breast-feeding reduces the frequency and severity of allergies in children. - Being born prematurely. Premature babies have a higher risk of developing allergies later in life. - Having one or more parents who have nasal allergies. Children have allergies if just one of their parents have allergies, then there risk is nearly 70%. - Environmental issues and lifestyle changes, Urban living, higher exposure to dust mites, atmospheric pollution, nutrition, lifestyle changes, maternal smoking, diesel fumes, geography, the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" the strongest risk factor for the development of allergies/asthma. Treatment for Allergy: - Before going to the treatment of allergy it is essential to know the basic things how the allergy occur and what is the scope of conventional treatment and homeopathic treatment - An allergy is the hyper immune reaction of a person to many substances which are though safe for others but harmful to an allergic people. - Those substances are called allergen or antigen - there are various types allergens or antigens present in the environment such as dust mites, pollens, various foods, many drugs, cold air, strong smells of various substances like perfumes, petrol, paints. - Those antigens or allergens when enters inside body our immune cells recognize them and eliminate them out. - Our immune cells like T cells (T lymphocyte) and B cells (B lymphocytes) play the major role to perform this task. - In a normal person when those antigen or allergen enter inside the body the immune system eliminate them without reacting anyway, but an allergic person of hypersensitive immune system reacts to those substances vigorously - A person of hypersensitive immune system, the B cells induces the inflammatory tissue reaction called allergic reaction when comes in contact to those antigens or allergens. The B cells of a sensitized immune system when detect any such foreign protein or antigen produce certain substances called IgE antibody. - In our body there are some cells called mast cells. Those mast cells contain some granules called histamine and heparin. Around the surface of mast cells numerous receptor are found called FC receptors to which the IgE antibody binds. - When any allergen invade the body the B cell identifies the invader and produces the IgE antibodies that flows and attach with the FC receptor of mast cell surface. - The antigen or allergen further binds with those IgE antibodies over mast cell surface. This way of antigen and antibody fixation stimulate the mast cell to releases the histamine content around the tissues. - Those histamines when comes in contact to the surrounding tissue binds to the histamine receptors (H1 receptor) present over the tissue surface and starts developing allergic reactions. - The symptoms of sneezing, runny nose, redness and itching of eyes nose are nothing but the outcomes result of histamine and tissue reaction. Scope of conventional treatment - Conventional treatment helps to check the allergic symptoms by histamine receptor antagonist or leukotriene receptor antagonist method. - Similarly the steroid preparation helps to minimize the inflammation of the respiratory and nasal mucous surface hence reduces the symptoms. - It helps to chect the allergic reaction in a short term period. Again when the person exposes to the same allergens produce same symptoms and need the same medication to stop the reaction. Therefore it becomes essential to take those medications for regular basis to check allergic reaction. - As we have to live in the same environment so it is quite difficult to keep away us from those allergens at all. - So for a long term curative prospect, it is required to rectify the hypersensitivity nature of the immune system of the allergic person so that when he get exposed to the same allergens does not react adversely which he was reacting earlier. Scope of Homeopathy Treatment - Constitutional Homeopathy treatment helps to rectify or modify the sensitive nature of the immune system of an allergic persons so gives a long term cure - If one person's immune system has become hypersensitive, so under the back ground there must be something that has made it such like. So what are the things that have made the immune system so hypersensitive? - Staying always in a stressful condition for weeks or even months produces cortisol, the body's stress-induced hormone. When cortisol becomes elevated and remains so for awhile, it affects the cells that comprise your immune system. So prolonged stress condition can affect your immune system to become hypersensitive. - When anybody is in stressful situation he/she may react differently to the stress. Some people feels hopeless, desperate from the stress. Some people feels frustrated, anger or vexed by the situation. Some people feel to cry out loudly or even cry while sharing their mater. A homeopathy physician searches out the exact reaction what the person express or feel out of a stress and accordingly choose the medicine. This is just a single example of selection of remedy. Similarly there are many factors needed to be considered to choose a suitable remedy for that patient. - There are different types of emotions like sadness, anger, frustration, fear, apprehension. Some people constantly suppress their natural emotions due to some unavoidable circumstance and that suppression directly affect on the immune system. so here a homeopathy physician try to find out what is the exact emotional factor has been suppressed and select accordingly one constitutional remedy which helps to modify his immune system to work normally. - The constitutional homeopathy treatment offers a long term cure to the allergic patient. Besides that there are many remedies which are given to manage the acute symptoms of allergic disease. - At the time of acute crises of allergic problem there are various medicines specifically used for a specific symptoms can be given to manage the acute condition.
