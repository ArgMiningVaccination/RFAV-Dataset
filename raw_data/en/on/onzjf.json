When I had a cold, my mom would put together a brew of ginseng and brown sugar. For heartburn, it was Job's tears and mung bean soup. When I struggled with skin issues, she came home with a bag of whole herbs prescribed by our family's Chinese medicine doctor that I boiled and drank like a tea. Now, in Los Angeles where I live, there are products everywhere inspired by the Chinese medicine I grew up with, packaged beautifully and marketed to the Western world. Companies like Moon Juice and Sun Potion are touting cordyceps (caterpillar fungus from Tibet) and reishi (one of the oldest medicinal mushrooms from China) as additions to smoothies, soups, even your morning coffee. I've always been a skeptic. I was taught to take herbs based on your constitution, or qi. Whether your energy is hot or cold or damp or dry determines the types of herbs you should consume, when, and how. I ask Dr. Joseph Yang, a professor and practitioner of Chinese medicine in L.A. Yang has a Ph.D. in psychiatry and neuroscience from Kobe University in Japan and a Masters in Chinese medicine. \"These are powerful medicines,\" he tells me. \"If you eat too much, you can get sick.\" Charlotte Duh, who owns a Chinese medicine practice for women called [Meal 4 Mom](http://www.meal4mom.com/) in Los Angeles, agrees. She says too much reishi, for example, can cause irregular heartbeats. And she says that adding a powder like Moon Juice's brain dust or Sun Potion's ashwagandha isn't the best way to get the benefits of those plants and herbs. \"Most of the effectiveness of these herbs come in how they're prepared,\" she says. \"Most Chinese doctors recommend their clients boil the whole herbs and drink that liquid.\" According to Duh, the best way to ensure quality products is to buy locally and to stick to the right dose. \"I still think self-diagnosis is problematic, but if people must, never take more than a gram,\" she says Here are six of Duh's recommendations that, she says, are less likely to cause side effects and can be safely consumed by most people. Job's tears Also known as Chinese pearl barley, [Job's tears](http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/article/jobs-tears-grain-recipes) fight inflammation and are good for the skin. \"You can cook it, exfoliate with it and then use it as a mask,\" says Duh. Job's tears are grown in the States and you can find organic versions online. Goji berries \"Organic goji berry is a very effective product, and we grow it here in Southern California,\" Duh says. A powerful antioxidant, the berry can be steeped into a tea or tossed into just about any dish. Jujube Often used as a sleeping aid and thought to help with weight control, dried jujubes are often steeped into teas and used in soups. Hibiscus \"Dried hibiscus is very rich in Vitamin C,\" Duh says. She recommends drinking it as a tea. \"It's sour so just add honey,\" she warns. Rose Duh prescribes rose for women with irregular periods. She recommends dried rose petals for most people and whole dried rose buds for those who want a stronger dose. American ginseng Ginseng grown in the U.S. has more or less the same benefits as cordyceps. \"It's an immune system booster and helps with energy,\" Duh says. \"It's also good for circulation.\" Try it steeped in water and paired with lemon.
