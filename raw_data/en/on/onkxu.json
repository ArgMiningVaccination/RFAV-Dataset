People of all ages in countries throughout the world are affected by thischronic airway disorder that can be severe and sometimesfatal. The prevalence of asthma is increasing everywhere,especially among children. Asthma is a significant burden,not only in terms of health care costs but also of lostproductivity and reduced participation in family life. During the past two decades, we have witnessed many scientific advances that have improved our understandingof asthma and our ability to manage it effectively.However, the diversity of national health care servicesystems and variations in the availability of asthmatherapies require that recommendations for asthma carebe adapted to local conditions throughout the globalcommunity. In addition, public health officials requireinformation about the costs of asthma care, how toeffectively manage this chronic disease, and besteducation methods in order to develop asthma careservices and programs responsive to the particular needsand circumstances within their countries. Accordingly, in 1993, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute collaborated with the World Health Organization toconvene a workshop that led to the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention , a Workshop Report that presented a comprehensive plan to manage asthmawith the goal of reducing chronic disability and prematuredeaths while allowing patients with asthma to leadproductive and fulfilling lives. At the same time, a program called the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was implemented to develop a network ofindividuals, organizations, and public health officials todisseminate information about the care of patients withasthma while at the same time assuring a mechanism toincorporate the results of scientific investigations intoasthma care. Three publications based on the WorkshopReport were prepared to promote internationalcollaboration and dissemination of information: Asthma Management and Prevention: A PracticalGuide for Public Health Officials and Health CareProfessionals Pocket Guide for Asthma Management andPrevention What You and Your Family Can Do About Asthma These documents have been widely disseminated, andtranslated into several languages. GINA has conductedworkshops with local doctors and national opinion leaders,held seminars at national and international meetings, andhelped support a \"train the trainer\" program through theNational Research Training Center in the UK. In 2000, the GINA Executive Committee recommended updating the 1995 Workshop Report to incorporate newscientific information. The methods used to prepare theupdate are described in the Introduction. It is a privilegefor me to acknowledge the work of the many people whoparticipated in this update project, as well as toacknowledge the superlative work of all who havecontributed to the success of the GINA program. The GINA program has been conducted through educational grants from contributions ofthese companies assured that workshop members couldmeet together to discuss issues and reach consensus in aconstructive and timely manner. The workshop membersare, however, solely responsible for the statements andconclusions presented in this publication. The GINA publications are available through the Internet (http://www.ginasthma.com).

RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS ....173 x COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEAsthma is a major, chronic airway disorder that is a serious public health problem in countries throughout the world. Asthma affects people of all ages, can besevere, and is sometimes fatal. In 1993, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was formed. Its goals and objectives were described in a 1995NHLBI/WHO Workshop Report, Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention . This Report and its companion documents have been widely distributed andtranslated into many languages. A large network ofindividuals and organizations interested in asthma carehas been created and has initiated several country-specificasthma management programs. Yet much work is stillrequired to reduce morbidity and mortality from this chronicdisease. SUMMARY OF THE UPDATED REPORTThe GINA program is conducted under the leadership of an Executive Committee. In January 2000, thisCommittee suggested that the Workshop Report beupdated to incorporate the many advances detailed inscientific publications since 1995. The Committeerecommended that the Workshop Report provide acomprehensive summary of the scientific findings on whichmanagement decisions are made. Thus, Chapters 1through 4 of this updated Workshop Report include newfindings on the genetics, risk factors, natural history, andpathogenesis of asthma. Chapter 5 provides an update ondiagnosis and assessment; Chapter 6 providesrecommendations for patient education and the scientificbackground of these recommendations. Chapter 7provides details of a six-part asthma managementprogram for both adults and children. Researchrecommendations are summarized in Chapter 8. Highlights of some of the features in this updated Workshop Report include: Chapter 1, Definition, updates information that leads to the definition of asthma as a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. Chapter 2, Burden of Asthma, combines Chapter 2, Epidemiology, and Chapter 8, Socioeconomics, from the1995 Workshop Report. The new chapter details theavailable data on asthma prevalence throughout theworld. Chapter 3, Risk Factors, includes information about the risk factors for asthma. Asthma risk factors are divided into two categories, host factors and environmentalfactors. Chapter 4, Mechanisms of Asthma, updates information about the cellular and molecular events that lead toinflammation and airway remodeling. A section on patho-physiology provides an overview of the role ofinflammation in causing the airflow limitation andsymptoms characteristic of asthma. Chapter 5, Diagnosis and Classification, recommends a system for classifying asthma severity that includes foursteps (Intermittent, Mild Persistent, Moderate Persistent,and Severe Persistent Asthma) based on the presence ofclinical features before optimal treatment is achievedand/or on the amount of daily medication required forcontrol of asthma. Chapter 6, Education and Delivery of Care, provides the scientific background for asthma education efforts andrecommends tools that may be helpful in the education ofpatients and health professionals. Chapter 7, A Six-Part Asthma Management Program, provides a comprehensive asthma management planusing the same six parts as the 1995 Workshop Report.Among the important changes in the updated Report are: Chapter 7.3, Avoid Exposure to Risk Factors, combines Chapter 6 (Prevention) and Chapter 7.3(Avoid or Control Asthma Triggers: Non-Pharmacological Secondary Prevention) of the 1995Workshop Report. The updated chapter includessegments on primary, secondary, and tertiaryprevention of asthma. Chapter 7.4, Establish Medication Plans for Long- Term Asthma Management, includes separate sections detailing asthma management in adults andchildren. Both sections emphasize the importance ofinhaled glucocorticosteroids for asthma managementat all steps of severity except intermittent asthma. Chapter 8, Research Recommendations, details some of the important research questions related to asthma that require investigation. INTRODUCTION xi COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEFUTURE CHALLENGES In spite of the efforts to improve asthma care that have taken place over the past decade, a majority of patientshave not benefited from advances in asthma treatmentand many lack even the rudiments of care. A challenge forthe next several years is to work with primary health careproviders and public health officials in various countries todesign and evaluate asthma care programs to meet localneeds. The GINA Executive Committee recognizes thatthis is a difficult task and, to aid in this work, has formed aDissemination Committee. The Dissemination Committeewill work to enhance communication with asthmaspecialists, primary-care health professionals, other healthcare workers, and patient support organizations. TheCommittee will also examine barriers to implementation ofthe recommendations in this Report, especially thechallenges that arise in primary-care settings and indeveloping countries. The GINA program has developed a network of individuals who care for asthma patients in many different health caresettings, including many developing countries. Many ofthese individuals were invited to review this Report. Whilethe reviewers acknowledged that early diagnosis ofasthma and implementation of appropriate therapysignificantly reduce the socioeconomic burdens of asthmaand enhance patients' quality of life, many of them alsoemphasized that medications continue to be the majorcomponent of the cost of asthma treatment. They urgedthat the pricing of asthma medications continue to beexamined, as this has important implications for the overallcosts of asthma management. It is recognized that a large segment of the world's population lives in areas with inadequate medical facilitiesand meager financial resources. In this regard, onereviewer emphasized the importance of using alternativemethods to measure and monitor the severity of asthma inthe absence of funds to purchase peak flow meters, andthis recommendation was incorporated into the Report. Itis also recognized that \"fixed\" international guidelines and\"rigid\" scientific protocols will not work in many locations,and for this reason GINA encourages thatrecommendations found in this Report be adapted to fitlocal practices and the availability of health careresources. As the GINA Dissemination Committeeundertakes its work, every effort will be made to interactwith patient and physician groups at national, district, and local levels, and in multiple health care settings, tocontinuously examine new and innovative approaches thatwill ensure the delivery of the best asthma care possible. In an effort to evaluate new scientific findings and their im-pact on management recommendations made in theWorkshop Report, the GINA Executive Committee hasformed a GINA Scientific Committee. This Committee willexamine new clinical trial publications in peer-reviewedjournals. As new findings are identified that affect recom-mendations made in the GINA publications, they will bedescribed on the GINA website (http://www.ginasthma.com). Developments in asthma prevention are promising and research in this important area is a priority. There aremany other important areas for investigation, one of whichis continued epidemiologic studies. One of our colleagues,Dr. Ann Woolcock, who devoted much of her career to thestudy of asthma through epidemiologic studies in largepopulations, died on February 17, 2001. Her contributionsto asthma research, and the GINA program, will be greatlymissed. METHODS USED TO DEVELOP THIS REPORTAfter the GINA Executive Committee recommended preparation of an updated Workshop Report in January2000, the Committee members worked in concert withNHLBI and WHO staff to identify individuals from thescientific community to participate as ConsultantContributors in producing the update. The ExecutiveCommittee members and these additional members of thescientific community formed an Expert Panel to write theupdate of the Report. One member of the Executive Committee, along with one or more members of the scientific community, prepared an updated draft of each chapter. The first draft of theupdated document was discussed during a workshopcosponsored by the NHLBI and the WHO in Toronto,Canada in May 2000 at the time of the American ThoracicSociety meeting. Additional drafts of the chapters wereprepared and reviewed by members of the ExecutiveCommittee in October 2000, January 2001, and May 2001. In July 2001, the document was sent for review to all authors, as well as individuals and medical societiesinterested in the management of asthma. The reviewers'comments were incorporated, as appropriate, into the finaldocument by the Chair of the GINA Executive Committeeand the Chair of the GINA Scientific Committee incooperation with members of the Expert Panel. Throughout the process, the GINA Executive Committee agreed that clinical recommendations would require xii COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEscientific evidence and that each chapter would contain updated scientific references as appropriate. Memberschose to assign levels of evidence to statements using thesystem developed by the NHLBI ( Table A). Levels of evidence are assigned to management recommendationswhere appropriate in Chapter 6, Education and Delivery ofCare, and Chapter 7, A Six-Part Asthma ManagementProgram, and are indicated in boldface type enclosed inparentheses after the relevant statement-e.g., ( Evidence A). However, the Committee also recognized that evidence may not be available for all recommendationsand, in this case, should be clearly labeled as \"expertopinion\" (Evidence D). The methodological issuesconcerning the use of evidence from meta-analyses werecarefully considered (e.g., a meta-analysis of a number ofsmaller studies was considered to be evidence level B) 1.

Depending on severity, the airflow limitation is accompanied by symptoms of breathlessness, wheezing,chest tightness, and cough. Production of sputum is alsoa feature in some patients with asthma, particularlyfollowing acute exacerbations and in its chronic persistentform. It is important to differentiate the underlyingcondition from the recurrent exacerbations. Asthma is achronic disorder of the airways resulting in variablesymptoms and airflow limitation over time. Exacerbationsof asthma (attacks or worsening of asthma symptoms andlung function) are acute; they can be rapid in onset oroccur gradually. However, under both circumstancesexacerbations can be severe and even result in death inthe absence of effective treatment. More often, presentingsymptoms are less severe, and occasionally they may betotally absent. DEFINITION OF ASTHMA Many attempts have been made to define asthma in termsof its impact on lung function-that is, airflow limitation, itsreversibility, and airway hyperresponsiveness 1. However, these attempts have been frustrated by a lack ofunderstanding of the mechanisms involved in asthma.Appreciation of the key role of the underlying inflammatoryresponse in asthma leads to a more complete definition ofasthma 2. Based on the functional consequences of airwayinflammation, an operational description of asthma is that: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of theairways in which many cells and cellular elements playa role. The chronic inflammation causes an associatedincrease in airway hyperresponsiveness that leads torecurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chesttightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in theearly morning. These episodes are usually associatedwith widespread but variable airflow obstruction that isoften reversible either spontaneously or with treatment. The remainder of this chapter provides the framework forthis working definition of asthma based on the underlyingpathology of airway inflammation and its relation todisordered lung function 3. This view of asthma has profound implications in terms of diagnosis, prevention,and management. A greater understanding of asthmamanagement has been achieved by accepting thepersistence of the chronic inflammatory response, withvariations in the magnitude of the inflammation reflectingthe clinical activity of asthma. AIRWAY PATHOLOGY IN ASTHMA Until recently most information on the pathology of asthmahas been obtained from postmortem tissue. Macroscopicallyin patients who have died of asthma the lung is overinflated,KEY POINTS: Asthma-irrespective of the severity-is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. Airway inflammation is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, andrespiratory symptoms. Airway inflammation produces four forms of airflow limitation: acute bronchoconstriction, swelling of theairway wall, chronic mucus plug formation, andairway wall remodeling. Atopy, the production of abnormal amounts of IgE antibodies in response to common environmentalallergens, is the strongest identifiable predisposingfactor for developing asthma. Considering asthma an inflammatory disorder has implications for the diagnosis, prevention, andmanagement of the disorder. 2DEFINITION Figure 1-1.

Trophic changes identified in postmortem studies include smooth musclehypertrophy, new vessel formation, increased numbers ofepithelial goblet cells, and the deposition of interstitialcollagens beneath the epithelium (basement membranethickening), changes which may arise as the result ofinjury and may lead to remodeling. Thus, there isevidence of both acute and chronic inflammation that isirregularly distributed throughout the airways, including thesmallest airways (less than 2 mm in diameter), and theparenchyma 5. This wide distribution of inflammation carries implications for delivery of inhaled medications tothe appropriate areas of the lung. Most pathologic studies of living subjects with asthma have employed endobronchial biopsies of patients withmild disease. Generally, these tissue findings reflect thoseseen in autopsy. However, studies of patients with moresevere asthma, in both acute and chronic settings, suggestthat in addition to eosinophils and lymphocytes,neutrophils are also present and may play a contributingrole in this more severe disease 6. These reports support earlier studies that suggest neutrophils dominate the lungsof people with asthma who die suddenly of the disease 7. The relationship between the pathological changes andclinical indices has been difficult to obtain. Because thereare no well-validated noninvasive measurements of airwayinflammation in asthma, clinicians have had to rely onsurrogate indices such as sputum eosinophils and exhalednitric oxide. Clinicians have long recognized anassociation of sputum and blood eosinophilia with asthma 8, although in parts of the world where parasitic disease isendemic, these tests are of limited value. The applicationof fiberoptic bronchoscopy to obtain lavage and tissuedirectly from the airways has provided the most convincingevidence linking disordered lung function to a specific typeof mucosal inflammation 9. In all forms of asthma, there is evidence to implicate mast cells and eosinophils as thekey effector cells of the inflammatory response-throughtheir capacity to secrete a wide range of preformed andnewly generated mediators that act on the airways bothdirectly and indirectly through neural mechanisms 10. The application of immunological and molecular biologicaltechniques to asthma has placed T lymphocytes as pivotalcells in orchestrating the inflammatory response throughthe release of multifunctional cytokines 11. Whether the pattern of T-cell activation found in asthma is unique to thisdisease alone is not established but is unlikely. Othertypes of airway disease, including chronic bronchitis andbronchiectasis, also have lymphocyte involvement 12. The generation of cytokines by \"structural\" (constituent) cells ofthe airways, including fibroblasts and endothelial andepithelial cells, is increasingly considered to be importantin the maintenance of the inflammatory response 13. Although the presence and quantification of inflammatorycells in sputum and their mediators in various body fluidshave been used to reflect the activity of underlying airwayinflammation, currently there is no direct measurement ofthis process that can be used routinely 14. In addition to potent mediators that contract airway smoothmuscle, increase microvascular leakage, activate differentneurons, and stimulate mucus-secreting cells, a number offactors are released that have the capacity to producestructural changes in the airways or attract inflammatorycells to cause injury to bronchial tissue. Of particularimportance is a targeted attack of these processes on theciliated epithelium, which, in places, becomes stripped to asingle layer of basal cells 15. Moreover, epithelial cells and myofibroblasts, which lie beneath the epithelium, mayproliferate, and, in doing deposit interstitial collagens inthe lamina reticularis of the subbasement membrane area. This response and injury-repair process explains theapparent basement membrane thickening that ischaracteristic of asthma 16. There is accumulating evidence that other trophic changes,including hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway goblet cell number, enlargement ofsubmucous gl ands, and remodeling of the airway connective tissue, are important components of the disease. Althoughmany of the mediators responsible for these changes tothe airway architecture have yet to be defined, cytokines,chemokines, and growth factors seem to be pa rticularly important. These factors are produced by a wide variety ofcells, including mast cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and smooth muscle cells. Chemokines are important in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airway. Lymphocytes, particularlythose that are polarized toward producing cytokinesencoded in the IL-4 gene cluster on chromosome 5q (Th2cells), have important functions in directing andmaintaining the airway inflammatory process. The releaseof mediators and the regulation of the inflammatoryprocess in asthma is complex, redundant, and self-perpetuating. Figure 1-2 illustrates some of the relationships between mechanisms of inflammation and DEFINITION 3 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEremodeling processes in asthma. However, it is not clearly understood what factors regulate the transitions betweenacute inflammation, persistent disease, and remodeling, orthe perpetuation of any of these states. Understandingthese factors will be important to developing more effectivetreatments in the future 3. Asthma in children and adults is frequently found in association with atopy, which is defined as the productionof abnormal amounts of immunoglobulin E (IgE) directedto epitopes expressed on common environmentalallergens such as dust mites, animal proteins, pollens, andfungi 17. As a consequence the mast cell is sensitized and, when appropriately activated, initiates the inflammatoryresponse. Atopy occurs in 30 to 50 percent of thepopulation in developed countries 18and frequently occurs in the absence of disease. However, when expressed inthe lower airways, atopy is one of the strongest risk factorsfor asthma. When expressed in other organs, it gives riseto such diseases as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema (atopicdermatitis), and food allergy. For most patients with asthma, the disease begins prior to 6 years of age. However, there is evidence that processesinvolved in sensitization may begin in utero. The initiation of the potential for allergic sensitization and eventual translation into inflammation with wheezing appear to beinfluenced by many factors in early life, including exposureto tobacco smoke, viral respiratory infections (particularlyrespiratory syncytial virus), diet, antibiotic use, anddomestic (house dust) mite sensitization at 1 to 2 years ofage. The regulation of these processes and resultingbalance, or imbalance, in cytokine production is not wellestablished, but understanding them is likely important tothe eventual understanding of airway inflammation and thepossibility of an injury/repair process in asthma 19,20.RELATIONSHIP OF AIRWAY PATHOLOGY TO DISORDERED LUNG FUNCTION Airway hyperresponsiveness and acute airflow limitation are the two predominant manifestations of disordered lung function. Airway HyperresponsivenessAn important component of asthma underlying the instability of the airways is the presence of an exaggeratedbronchoconstrictor response to a wide variety of exogenousand endogenous stimuli. Several mechanisms have beenproposed to explain this airway hyperresponsiveness, butevidence suggests that airway inflammation is a key factor.The state of hyperresponsiveness in which the airwaysnarrow too easily and too much in response to manydifferent provoking stimuli is sometimes referred to asnonspecific, but in reality the stimuli often used to reveal itact by highly specific mechanisms. They may be classifiedas causing airflow limitation directly by stimulating airwaysmooth muscle (e.g., methacholine and histamine);indirectly by releasing pharmacologically activesubstances mediator-secreting as mastcells (exercise hyper- and hypo-osmolar stimuli) ornonmyelinated sensory neurons (sulfur dioxide andbradykinin); or by a combination of both mechanisms(Figure 1-3 and Figure 1-4) 21. In the laboratory, airway hyperresponsiveness can bequantified by constructing stimulus-response curves anddescribing the position and shape of these either in termsof the provocative dose or concentration of agonist produc-ing a specified fall in lung function, usually in forced 4DEFINITIONTissue repair & remodeling Reprinted with permission from the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.Figure 1-2. Mechanisms of Acute and Chronic Inflammation in Asthma and Remodeling Processes3 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEexpiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), or by the presence of a plateau and the concentration of agonists at which this occurs (Figure 1-5)22. Measurement of airway hyperresponsiveness has been standardized for histamineand methacholine administered via aerosol inhalation bytidal breathing 23or administered in predetermined amounts via a dosimeter24. Although several different tests of lung function have been used to measure changes in airwaycaliber following provocation, the FEV1has been most widely adopted, with the position of the stimulus-responsecurve identifying the provocative concentration (or dose) of agonist. The provocative concentration reduces FEV1by 20 percent from baseline (PC 20or PD20) and serves as an index of responsiveness ( Figure 1-5). Note that the cutoff point between normal and increased responsivenessis dependent on the method used and the populationstudied and should be adjusted accordingly 25. The clinical consequences of airway hyperresponsivenessare reflected in an increased variation in airway caliberboth within and between days ( Figure 1-6) 26. Nocturnal and/or early morning symptoms with a diurnal variation inpeak expiratory flow (PEF) (which correlates well withFEV1) of 20 percent or more are highly characteristic of Figure 1-4.

Increased basal airway tone is a further consequence of airway hyperresponsiveness and formsthe basis of the bronchodilator test for asthma; an increaseof 15 percent or more in FEV1or PEF 10 to 20 minutes after inhalation of a short-acting /H92522-agonist is accepted as diagnostic ( Figure 1-7) 27. In subjects with greatly reduced baseline airway caliber, it is important to consider theabsolute change in volume rather than solely relying onthe percentage change to determine reversibility 28. Bronchodilation is of diagnostic help in demonstratingreversible airflow obstruction only if the baseline measureof pulmonary function is less than or equal to 80 percent ofthe predicted (or best) normal value. In subjects withbaseline airway caliber falling within the normal range,provocation testing is helpful to identify bronchialhyperresponsiveness, which is compatible with, but notdiagnostic of, asthma 25. For example, exercise testing using a standard 6-minute protocol has found particularuse in the diagnosis of asthma especially in children, witha 15 percent fall in FEV1or 20 percent fall in PEF from baseline 5 to 15 minutes post-exercise being diagnostic(Figure adenosine -monophosphate (AMP) has been advocated as producing a bronchoprovocation that is more diagnosticfor asthma than that produced by histamine ormethacholine 31,32. The relationship between airway hyperresponsiveness,asthma severity, and inflammatory processes remainscomplex. Although glucocorticosteroids commonlyimprove asthma symptoms and decrease the evidence ofinflammation in the airways, their effect on airwayresponsiveness, although significant, does not always fullyrestore this manifestation to normal levels. Whether thepersistence of airway hyperresponsiveness suggests thatairway remodeling may contribute to hyperresponsiveairways is not established. However, many children regain normal airway responsiveness as they enteradulthood 33. Airflow Limitation The recurrent episodes of airflow limitation in asthma have four forms. Each relates to the airway inflammatoryresponse ( Figure 1-9 ). Acute bronchoconstriction. The mechanism of acute airflow limitation varies according to the stimulus.Allergen-induced acute bronchoconstriction results fromthe IgE-dependent release from airway mast cells ofmediators, including histamine, prostaglandins, andleukotrienes, that contract the smooth muscle 34. This reaction, sometimes referred to as the early asthmaticresponse, forms the basis of bronchoconstriction uponexposure to aeroallergens. Asthma provoked bynonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is also considered to be the consequence of mediator release(especially leukotrienes), although the precisemechanisms responsible for this have yet to beelucidated 35-37. Acute airflow limitation may also occur because airways inasthma are hyperresponsive to a wide variety of stimuli. 6DEFINITION Figure 1-7. Typical Spirometric Tracings From a Normal Subject, a Subject With Asthma, and aSubject With Asthma After Using a Bronchodilator (bd) Figure 1-8.

COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEMany stimuli can cause acute bronchoconstriction, such as inhalation of allergens, exercise, cold air, fumes,chemicals, and strong emotional expressions like cryingand laughing. Their mechanisms for causingbronchoconstriction use differing combinations of directcontraction of smooth muscle, mediator release fromcytokine \"primed\" inflammatory cells, and stimulation of local and central neural reflexes ( Figure 1-4). Withdrawal of beta-adrenergic tone through theinadvertent use of antagonists may also produce acutesevere bronchoconstriction secondary to the unopposedaction of released constrictor mediators (especiallyacetylcholine) 38. The acute bronchoconstriction form of airflow limitation is rapidly reversed with an inhaledbronchodilator agent, such as short-acting /H92522-agonist 27. Swelling of the airway wall. Airflow limitation also results from edematous swelling of the airway wall with or withoutsmooth muscle contraction, or bronchoconstriction.Bronchodilators may relieve some of this component of airflow limitation, but it is more effectively reversed withanti-inflammatory drugs, especially glucocorticosteroids.This component of asthma is similar to the reduction inairway caliber that characteristically occurs 6 to 24 hoursfollowing allergen challenge of the airways and is referredto as the late asthmatic response 34. The increase in microvascular permeability and leakage leads to themucosal thickening and swelling of the airway outside thesmooth muscle. This causes swelling of the airway walland loss of elastic recoil pressure, both of which contributeto airway hyperresponsiveness 39,40. Chronic mucus plug formation. This more intractable airflow limitation has proven difficult to study, as it usuallytakes weeks or longer to resolve following the introductionof anti-inflammatory treatment. Increased mucus secretionand an exudate of serum proteins and cell debris combineto produce inspissated plugs that in severe asthmacharacteristically occlude the more peripheral airways andare difficult to dislodge. Airway wall remodeling. Airflow limitation sometimes fails to reverse with glucocorticosteroid treatment. The cellular and molecular basis of this lack of response maybe associated with structural changes to the airway matrixaccompanying longstanding and severe airway inflammation,or may relate to other, less well-defined effects thatrepresent a diminished response to mediators, includingglucocorticosteroids. From a clinical standpoint, airway inflammation is the most likely factor to account for varying severity of asthma andis therefore the element most responsive to controller med- ications such as inhaled glucocorticosteroids. However,even in the absence of symptoms and overt airflowlimitation, asthma continues to exist in the form of mildairway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness 10. Death resulting from asthma is most usually characterizedby extensive infiltration of the airways with eosinophils, mastcells, and mononuclear cells with extensive involvement oflarge as well as small airways 4. Between these extremes lies the common exacerbation of asthma in which mucosalswelling, excess secretions, and increased airway hyperre-sponsiveness are features of the inflammatory response.

There is good evidence that asthmaprevalence has been increasing in many countries, but asyet there are insufficient data to determine the likely causesof this increase and of the described variations in andbetween populations. The existing data on asthmaprevalence are derived mainly from developed countries.There are almost no data on the severity of the disease in different populations, nor on the impact of asthmamanagement guidelines. Further studies of the socioeconomicburden of asthma and the cost effectiveness of treatmentare needed in both developed and developing countries. DEFINITIONS RELATED TO ASTHMA EPIDEMIOLOGY In this section, the terms used in asthma epidemiology inthis report are defined, methods of classifying populationsand countries for epidemiological studies are explained,and the difficulties in defining ast hma for epidemiological studies are discussed. Defining Terms Prevalence . The percentage of the population with a disease, disorder, or abnormality. Cumulative prevalence is the total number, expressed as apercentage of the population, who have developed thedisorder at a given time. Point prevalence is thepercentage with the disorder at a given time. Incidence . The number of individuals who develop an abnormality within a given time (usually a year)expressed as a percentage of the population. Morbidity . The impact of a disease (hospitalization, etc.) and the degree to which the disease impairs a person'squality of life. Airway responsiveness . The response of the airways to provoking stimuli, usually expressed as the provokingdose (concentration causing a 20 percent fall in FEV1) or the slope of a dose-response curve. Airway hyperresponsiveness . A condition in which the airways narrow too easily or too much in response to aprovoking stimulus, as documented with measurementsof lung function under controlled conditions. In persistentasthma, the airways are hyperresponsive to manydifferent provoking stimuli. Atopy . The production of abnormal amounts of IgE antibodies in response to common environmentalallergens. Defining Populations Definitions of affluent, partly affluent, and non-affluent populations are based on economic grounds. Affluent populations . These populations have adequate housing, running water, and food. Most people in affluent populations have access to a universal health caresystem and medications (or are wealthy enough topurchase adequate medical care). Partly affluent populations . These populations have overcrowded housing, access to adequate water forwashing, and enough food, but only partial access tohealth care and social services. Medications areavailable but rarely affordable. 12 BURDEN OF ASTHMAKEY POINTS: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, imposing a substantial social burden onboth children and adults. Asthma occurs in all countries regardless of the level of development but varies greatly betweenpopulations, even within countries. There isevidence that over the last 20 years its prevalencehas considerably increased, especially amongchildren. Strategies to improve asthma control can lead to socioeconomic gains in terms of improved schoolattendance, fewer absences from work, and, byimplication, a smaller burden on families. Data on asthma incidence, severity, hospitalization, and mortality are needed for all countries to assist inmore effective health planning. Developed economies might expect 1 to 2 percent of total health care expenditures to be spent on asthma.Developing economies are likely to face anincreased demand for health care expendituresrelated to asthma. Poorly controlled asthma is expensive to manage. Investment in preventive medication is likely to yieldcost savings in emergency care for acuteexacerbations. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE Nonaffluent populations . These populations lack adequate housing and access to running water and may have irregular supply of food. Access to health care isinadequate. Migrants . People who have migrated or settled in another country. Defining Countries Developed country . The majority of the population is affluent. Developing country . Most of the population is partly affluent and trying to gain affluent status. Defining Asthma for Epidemiological StudiesDespite hundreds of reports on the prevalence and mortality of asthma in widely differing populations, the lack of precise definitions of asthma makes reliablecomparison of reported prevalence from different parts ofthe world problematic. However, the recent application ofstandardized met hods to measure the prevalence of asthma and wheezing illness in children 1and adults2 has aided in making such regional and internationalcomparisons. Some data from phase 2 of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood(ISAAC) permit between-population comparison of airway hyperresponsiveness, lung function, peak flowvariability, and atopy in children 3,4. The European Community Respiratory Health Study (ECRHS)5enabled between-population comparisons of airwayhyperresponsiveness, atopy, and symptoms of asthma in adults, but so far these three aspects of asthma havenot been correlated. Thus, because no epidemiologicaldefinition of asthma is emerging from current data,important components of epidemiological studies forasthma continue to include questionnaires, tests of airway hyperresponsiveness, and documentation ofputative etiologic factors including atopic status. Questionnaires. Most studies have used data obtained from questionnaires that, depending on the definitions used, may under- or overestimate the prevalence ofasthma. Standardized questionnaires are now availablefor children 1and adults2, but questionnaires suffer from potential variable intercultural responses to the descriptive terms used. The video questionnaire used in the ISAAC study 6has helped alleviate this problem and highlighted the potential for overdiagnosis of asthma based on questions about wheezing.Questionnaire definitions of asthma can be based onsymptoms such as \" wheeze ever\" (the least useful data because responses are influenced by the ability to recallthe events), \" wheeze in the past 12 months,\" or others such as chest tightness and cough. Defining asthma interms of symptoms alone has formed the basis of manyepidemiological studies, but this is fraught with difficulty inthe absence of objective measurement of airflow limitationand its variability 7. Diagnosis-based definitions include doctor/hospital diagnosis of asthma, which may beespecially valuable because of medical certification.However, children in some communities have asthma thathas never been diagnosed 8. Questions about medication use and emergency visits can be used to supplement diagnosis-based questions. Measurements of airway hyperresponsiveness. The definition of \" current asthma\" as symptoms of asthma within the past year associated with airway hyperresponsiveness, as defined by inhalation ofhistamine or methacholine, hypertonic saline challenge, or exercise challenge, is proving useful because it definesa group of subjects with clinically important asthma.These patients are more likely to have persistent asthmaand they need more treatment than subjects withsymptoms alone or with airway hyperresponsivenessalone 7. In affluent countries methacholine or histamine challengeremains the method of choice. Exercise challenge, usingstrict environmental conditions, and hypertonic salinechallenge are also used in some populations. However,these challenges do not measure the same abnormality ashistamine and methacholine challenges. Alternatively, theserial measurement of peak expiratory flow rate may becarried out over a period of 1 or 2 weeks to demonstratevariability, but this requires a level of cooperation that maybe difficult to accomplish in normal subjects 9-12. It appears that airway hyperresponsiveness andsymptoms of asthma (wheeze, chest tightness, andcough) measure different abnormalities in the airways, andthe presence of both defines \"clinically important \" asthma- that is, asthma that places patients at risk from persistentdisease. Using this definition, data are being obtained thatallow populations to be compared, and information aboutcauses, outcomes, and treatment regimens will becomemore meaningful. Evaluation of etiologic factors. Because atopy is often associated with asthma, it is important to perform skin tests using a standardized panel of allergens relevant for BURDEN OF ASTHMA 13 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEthe geographical area. The measurement of specific IgE in blood is an alternative, although it is more expensive. The measurement of total serum IgE is not a good methodfor determining the presence of atopy because it isaffected by responses to parasites and other yet-to-be-defined antigens, and thus does not accurately reflectspecific IgE. The characterization of the environment of populations appears to be critical in order to interpret the results ofother measurements. The environment can be assessedby measuring the amount of allergen (especially mite andcat allergen) present in the home, passive smoking, andoutdoor air pollution. PREVALENCE OF ASTHMA Children The prevalence of asthma symptoms in children varies from 0 to 30 percent in different populations. Figure 2-1 shows illustrative (not comprehensive) data on theprevalence of current asthma, diagnosed asthma, recentwheeze (symptoms in the last 12 months), airwayhyperresponsiveness, and atopy in children. There aremany data available for Australia and England, but fewerdata for other countries other than those derived fromquestions on wheeze in the ISAAC study 13. There are large differences in asthma prevalence amongdifferent populations, with the highest prevalence found inAustralia, New Zealand, and England. Data areinsufficient to determine whether the differences betweenpopulations are the consequence of responses to theenvironment, to industrialization, or to different allergenloads. Although there is some evidence that asthma isless prevalent in children with high levels of parasiticinfections 14, there have been no systematic studies relating parasitic infection to asthma where there has beenadjustment for other environmental factors. Figure 2-2, from the ISAAC study 1, shows the prevalence of wheezing in the last 12 months -documented by written questionnaires- among children 13 to 14 years old in a number of populations. The data show a wide range in the prevalence of wheezing in different populations (consistentwith the data in Figure 2-1), but few conclusions can be drawn about the risk factors for wheezing in children fromthese data. Figure 2-3 shows changes in the prevalence of asthma symptoms in children, young adults, and adults over time.Populations were studied with the same methods on twooccasions at least 9 years apart. In all cases an increasein prevalence was documented. This trend reflects a true increase in asthma prevalence, but is also affected by a recent tendency to label allepisodes of wheezing as asthma. Thus, questionnaireestimates may not be regarded as reliable measures of the 14 BURDEN OF ASTHMAFigure 2-1.

The reasons for the increase in the prevalence of asthma inchildren are poorly understood, but are discussed in thechapter on risk factors. AdultsData on the prevalence of asthma in adults are more controversial 31. As can be seen in Figure 2-3, there has been some increase in asthma in adults, but the increaseis not as striking as that in children. Figure 2-4 shows data from studies of various Australian populations andfrom the adult population in the ECRHS in which airwayhyperresponsiveness was measured. However, in manyof these studies, the relationship between symptoms andairway hyperresponsiveness has not been reported so it isdifficult to define clinically relevant asthma, especially asthere was no video questionnaire to document theprevalence of wheezing in the last year that was likely tobe due to asthma. There are few data on asthma in older adults. Although some studies have demonstrated that asthma prevalenceamong the elderly is equal to that in younger age groups 49, it is acknowledged that asthma in the elderly is underdiagnosed50. Diagnosis of asthma in older adults is often confounded by similar symptoms from cardiacfailure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, andnormal age-related changes in respiratory function 51. It is also more difficult because lung function testing is BURDEN OF ASTHMA 15Figure 2-3.

MORTALITY Mortality data are of limited value because they areavailable for relatively few countries, and they are rarelyavailable for different populations within the countries.However, trends in mortality may give an indication of the way a country is responding to the increasing burdenof asthma. Many factors lead to the uncertain reliability of mortality data. The code of the International Classification ofDiseases (ICD-8) was revised in 1979, and the new code(ICD-9) artificially increased the mortality rate in oldersubjects in some countries. Diagnostic habit has a largeinfluence because the clinical criteria for diagnosingasthma may have changed with time, and asthma maynow be better recognized than in the past. In oldersubjects, the cause of death may be miscoded if thepatient had coexisting asthma and chronic obstructivepulmonary disease. Misclassification of asthma at the timeof death has led to inaccuracies in mortality figures forasthma in the elderly 54, but relatively high asthma mortality rates are reported in this age group55,56. When making international comparisons of asthmamortality, asthma prevalence rates in the countries beingcompared must also be considered. This has recentlybeen made possible with the release of data from theECHRS 57and the ISAAC1,13,58. These data are depicted in Figure 2-5 to provide a comparison of asthma mortalityrates with prevalence rates of severe asthma in 12countries 59. In spite of the general unreliability of asthma mortality data,it is thought that for patients under 35 years of age theaccuracy of diagnosis on death certificates is over 85percent 60,61. Death rates in the 5- to 34-year age group are therefore the most reliable although based on a smallnumber of deaths. However, according to a US study,death certificate diagnosis of asthma as an underlyingcause of death has a low sensitivity but a high specificity 62, suggesting that increases in mortality due to asthma arenot likely to be caused by false-positive diagnosis ofasthma and that there may be an underestimation of actualasthma-related mortality, at least in the United States. 16BURDEN OF ASTHMAFigure 2-4.

COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEWhen the mortality rates are high (as in older adults in Japan and Germany), the numbers are probably muchless accurate because many patients suffering fromchronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be describedas having asthma on the death certificate. Studies of asthma mortality since 1960 show that mortality rates in the United States and Canada are lower than inother countries, although there are wide variations inmortality rates within the United States 63. In the 1990s asthma deaths increased in selected subpopulations in theUnited States, primarily among Blacks in inner-city areas 63. In the 1960s there was an increase in death rates in NewZealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom, and a decadelater a second epidemic of deaths was observed in NewZealand 64. The increase in asthma deaths in New Zealand has primarily been observed among the Maori64. Death rates in Japan have been relatively stable since the 1960s.In most countries asthma deaths occur predominantlyoutside the hospital. Several hypotheses in addition to artifacts in methodology have been proposed to explain the failure of mostcountries to decrease asthma mortality below about 0.4 to0.6 per 100,000 65. These include: Increasing severity of asthma . An overall increase in the severity of asthma increases the pool of patients at riskfor death. Failure of management . A failure in management is often observed among young patients who die from asthmaand may be due to the failure to use anti-inflammatoryagents, poor compliance, or an inadequate evaluation ofthe severity of the asthma (by patients or health careprofessionals). It is surprising that death rates are notdecreasing more significantly in young people in mostcountries despite the recognition of the therapeuticbenefits of inhaled corticosteroids. There are ethnicdifferences in mortality in New Zealand 64and in the United States63that may indicate racial trends in the severity of asthma, but more probably the trends are dueto the low income of these populations which impliesinability or reluctance to seek medical care and reducedability to afford inhaled glucocorticosteriods. Reactions to asthma medications . The use of isoprenaline forte may have been associated with theincrease in deaths in the 1960s in at least six countries.Also, retrospective studies carried out in New Zealand 66 and Canada67suggest that high doses of the short-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist fenoterol may have been associated with increased asthma deaths, and responsible for theincreased mortality in New Zealand in the 1970s and1980s. Association of asthma deaths with other /H92522- agonists is not supported by good evidence. It remainsto be seen whether beta-adrenergic receptorpolymorphisms are significant risk factors for thesedeaths. MORBIDITY Morbidity refers to the impact of a disease (hospitalization,etc.) and the degree to which it impairs a person 's quality of life. The factors underlying increased asthma morbiditymay include increased severity of the disease, under-treatment of patients with anti-inflammatory therapy, over-reliance on bronchodilators, and delay in seekingmedical help during an exacerbation. Poverty in affluentcountries also appears to be a risk factor for increasedmorbidity 63. Some data exist concerning the severity of asthma and thedegree to which it affects individuals ' lifestyle in various populations. Australian studies have shown that although8 to 11 percent of children and 6 to 7 percent of adultshave current asthma, about 4 percent of all age groupshave moderate or severe asthma that requires regularmedications 42. A comprehensive, multinational survey in Europe68and surveys from the United States69,70provide data on the effects of asthma management and treatmenton a variety of asthma outcomes.

NB: Mortality and prevalence data are not available in the same agegroup. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEQuality of Life More accurate methods of measuring morbidity, such as measurements of quality of life, are needed. Asthma is achronic disorder that can place considerable restrictions onthe physical, emotional, and social aspects of the lives ofpatients and may have an impact on their careers. Theremay be considerable absence from school or work 68,71,72. The importance of emotional factors and restriction onsocial life may be greater when symptoms are notadequately controlled. The underlying disorder by itselfmay cause distress, especially when its natural history isunpredictable. Inappropriate medical care can increasethese difficulties. Many people with asthma do notcompletely appreciate the impact of the disease on theirsocial life and claim they lead \"normal\" lives either because normality may be based on adjustments andrestrictions that they have already incorporated into theirlifestyles or because they deny their restrictions, wantingto \"live like others.\" General health status scales such as the Sickness ImpactProfile with 136 items 73have been used in the assessment of asthma. A compromise between lengthy questionnairesand single-item measures of health has also beenproposed. The Nottingham Health Profile with 45 itemsand the SF-36 (a Measures of Sickness short-form generalhealth survey) are now widely used and validated. TheSF-36 Health Status Questionnaire is based on 36 itemsselected to represent eight health concepts (physical,social, and role functioning; mental health; healthperceptions; energy/fatigue; pain; and general health) 74. A study was carried out using the SF-36 in patients withasthma of variable severity, and it was shown that mostitems correlated with the severity of asthma 75, suggesting that such scales may be used to compare differentpopulations. Specific quality-of-life scales includequestions targeted to asthma; many have been employedin clinical trials 76-78. The Tayside Asthma Assessment Stamp (for patient 's medical records) can be used in routine consultations to document morning, night-time, andexercise symptoms; peak flow; inhaler compliance; and\"days school, or play due to asthma 79,80. An electronic version of this stamp is displayed athttp://www.srs.org.uk. Hospital AdmissionsThe relationships among changes in prevalence, hos- pitalization rates, and mortality are unclear 31,56. Increased hospital admission rates seen in some countries during the1980s 81,82do not appear to be due to a change in dia- gnosis, or to admission of patients with less severeasthma, but may be related to an increased prevalence ofasthma as well as to a greater severity of asthma. It is also important to note that changes in parents ' attitudes or in health care practices may influence the rate of hospital admissions, and this may explain some reportsof declining hospitalization rates. In Finland, asthma hasbeen more frequently treated in outpatient clinics since1985, leading to a decrease in hospital admissions. InSweden, although the prevalence of asthma in schoolchildren increased between 1985 and 1993, hospitaladmissions decreased 45 percent in children aged 2 to 18,and a decreasing trend in the total number of hospital dayshas also been recorded. Increased use of anti-inflammatorymedications, largely in the form of inhaled glucocorticosteroids,is thought to be the major reason for these decreasedhospitalization rates 83. Data from Norway indicate a significant decrease in readmission rates for children withasthma between 1980 and 1995, also attributed toincreased use of anti-inflammatory medications 84. NATURAL HISTORY OF ASTHMA Infancy Asthma may develop during the first few months of life, but it is often difficult to make a definite diagnosis until thechild is older. In infants, the condition most commonlyassociated with wheezing is thought to be respiratory viralinfection. Wheezing illness in infancy has recently beenclassified 85. There is a correlation of early wheeze with re- duced lung function before the development of symptoms,suggesting that small lungs may be responsible for someinfant wheezing that resolves with the child 's growth. Wheezing in the first year of life is not a prognosticindicator for asthma or for more severe asthma later inchildhood. Those children who continue to wheeze in laterchildhood apparently have asthma related to atopy.Recurring exacerbations of asthma may be associatedwith exposure to allergens. In the susceptible infant, atopyappears to predispose the airways to sensitization byenvironmental allergens or irritants, and thus the infantmay experience recurrent episodes of wheezing. Someepisodes of asthma appear to be mainly allergen-related,others appear to be virus-related 86, and many may be attributable to some interplay of these causes. Whileviruses appear to be more important than allergens ininfancy, allergens take on a greater role as childrenapproach school age. One study demonstrated that the majority of 7-year-olds with airway hyperresponsiveness suffered from atopy asinfants 87. Another study concerning pulmonary 18 BURDEN OF ASTHMA COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEdevelopment showed that asthma in infancy can result in a decrease in lung function of approximately 20 percent inadulthood, indicating the possible deleterious effect ofasthma on the development of the lung 88. However, a subsequent study did not confirm this finding89, and the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) Studyshowed that FEV1was well maintained 90between the ages of 5 and 15. However, diminishing FEV1was associated with greater duration of asthma beforeenrollment in the study (at age 5) 91. Childhood The predominant feature associated with asthma in children is allergy. An Australian study, for example,indicated that sensitivity and exposure to domestic mitesrepresents the major predictor of asthma 92. The role of viral infections in the etiology of asthma is not clear. Inatopic children, viral infections are clearly important inasthma exacerbations, but there are few data that suggestthey directly cause the onset of asthma. By age 8, aproportion of children develop airway hyperresponsivenessand the associated symptoms of moderate to severepersistent asthma, while others continue to have mild inter-mittent asthma 93. Many children with asthma also suffer from allergic rhinitis as documented in the ISAAC Study1. Lung growth appears to be relatively normal in mostchildren with asthma, but it can be reduced throughoutchildhood and adolescence in those with severe andpersistent symptoms. A longitudinal study of children inNew Zealand concluded that growth as measured byspirometric tests of lung function was impaired amongthose children with airway hyperresponsiveness and/orallergy to domestic mite or cat allergen 94. Similar studies in Australia showed that airway hyperresponsiveness inchildren resulted in reduced lung function as measured byspirometry at the age of 18 95. Whether this reflects a failure to reach full growth because of asthma or simplythe presence of congenitally small lungs is unknown. Itmust be noted that most of the studies performed to datethat have shown reduced lung growth in children withasthma have measured lung function prior tobronchodilator therapy, and therefore have simplymeasured reversible airways obstruction. Most studiesthat have measured post-bronchodilator airway functionhave shown very little long-term effect of asthma ongrowth of lung function. The long-term prognosis of childhood asthma is now of major concern. It has often been suggested that childhoodasthma will \" disappear\" when the patient reaches adulthood. Epidemiological evidence gives less cause foroptimism 89,96,97. Despite methodological difficulties in thelongitudinal studies, it has been estimated that asthmadisappears in 30 to 50 percent of children (especiallymales) at puberty, but often reappears in adult life. Up totwo-thirds of children with asthma continue to suffer fromthe disorder through puberty and adulthood. Moreover,even when asthma has clinically disappeared, the lungfunction of the patient frequently remains altered, or airwayhyperresponsiveness or cough persists. The prognosis ofasthma appears to be worse when the child has eczemaor a family history of eczema. It should also be noted that 5 to 10 percent of children with asthma that is considered to be trivial have severeasthma in later life. Childhood asthma must never beneglected in the hope that the child will simply grow out of it. Children with mild asthma are likely to have a goodprognosis, but children with moderate or severe asthmaprobably continue to have some degree of airwayhyperresponsiveness and will be at risk for the long-termeffects of asthma throughout life 97. Adulthood Asthma can begin in adult life in response to sensitizing agents at the workplace and, perhaps, from thedevelopment of atopy later in life. Viral infections may still,in adult life, be a trigger of asthma exacerbations, but thereis no published evidence that they cause the onset ofasthma. The proportion of patients with late-onset asthmathat come from the group with past asthma is unknown. Ina long-term study of asthma from childhood 97,98, it was found that the more severe the asthma in childhood, themore severe the asthma in adult life, and many of thosewho \"lost\" their symptoms continued to have either abnormal lung function or airway hyperresponsiveness.Those with the worst asthma were also the most atopic.While confirmatory studies are required, data from theNurses Health Study suggest a higher incidence of asthmain postmenopausal women taking estrogen 99. The natural history of lung growth and senescence in adults with asthma has been given less attention than thenatural history of chronic airflow limitation. Duringadulthood, clinical asthma may be associated with anincrease in the rate of decline in FEV1 100-102. In middle- aged and elderly smokers, it is virtually impossible to sepa-rate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma bymeans of FEV1. Airway hyperresponsiveness appears to be associated with an increase in the rate of decline oflung function. However, the effect of asthma is variable,and not all subjects with asthma have steep rates ofdecline. It appears that asthma starting after the age of 50elicits a steeper rate of decline than asthma with an earlieronset 103. Permanent airflow limitation is not rare in adults BURDEN OF ASTHMA 19 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEwith asthma, as demonstrated by lung function measurements and computed tomography (CT) scans, onwhich permanent abnormalities of the airways can beobserved 104. Many elderly people with asthma have severe airways disease and lung function impairment105. SOCIOECONOMICS Socioeconomic factors are integral to asthma care, whether viewed from the perspective of the individualsufferer, the health care professional, or organizations thatprovide health care. While a global perspective onsocioeconomic factors is the ultimate goal, most of theliterature currently available reflects knowledge gainedfrom developed rather than developing countries. Data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide an indication of the burdenof illness experienced by children with asthma comparedto children without asthma. In a 1988 National HealthInterview Survey, children with asthma missed 10.1 milliondays from school (2 times the number of days missed bychildren without asthma), and had 12.9 million contactswith medical doctors and 200,000 hospitalizations 106. In the same survey, it was determined that almost 30 percentof children with asthma experienced some limitation ofphysical activity, compared to only 5 percent of childrenwithout asthma 107. Absence from school has been documented as anadverse consequence of asthma in studies from India,Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom 108-111, and may impair long-term educational achievement104. School absence rates may be a proxy marker of asthmaseverity and may correlate with treatment outcomes 112. Subtler educational effects, although difficult to measure,may be the loss of learning time due to asthma symptomsand disruption of class work while obtaining treatmentssuch as inhalers. Restriction of physical activity has been reported in studies from the United States and India 107,108. Preschool learning and socializing opportunities are likely to be impaired inyoung children unable to join in normal activities as aconsequence of asthma. Suboptimum control of asthmacan lead to missed recreation opportunities throughoutchildhood and adult life. Asthma has been documented as a major cause of absence from work in many countries, including Australia,Sweden, and the United Kingdom 106,112-114. It is likely that reports underestimate the true level of absence due toasthma as employees concerned about job security mayopt to report episodes of work absence as due torespiratory infections rather than declare a chronic healthproblem such as asthma. The choice of occupation canbe influenced by asthma 114, and in some regions the sole source of employment may be in an occupation clearlyunsuited to people with asthma. Uncontrolled asthma in one family member can impede the economic effectiveness of other family members 115. Time spent caring for the person with asthma andobtaining medicines, as well as high medical bills, cancause substantial burden for entire families. Effectivemedical treatment for a person with asthma can not onlyrestore the individual to a normal lifestyle but also providean economic benefit to the entire family unit. Socioeconomic \"Cause and Effect\"Socioeconomic factors are relevant to the causes of asthma, access to treatment, and clinical outcomes 116, although the precise relationships between socioeconomicfactors and asthma may vary from country to country. Astudy from Zimbabwe demonstrated that urban living andhigher material standards of living appeared to beassociated with a higher prevalence of reversible airwaysobstruction in children 117. This could in part be due to better access to health care and increased diagnosisrates, but also represents a true increase in the prevalenceof asthma-related symptoms. In developed countries,inner-city living is associated with a greater prevalence ofasthma-related symptoms 110. Damp, poorly ventilated houses with house-dust mite colonization are adverseenvironmental factors associated with lower socioeconomic status and inner-city living in developed countries. Studies in Mexico 111, the United States70, the United Kingdom113, Germany114, and Australia115indicate that low- income and minority populations experience a substantially higher prevalence of asthma, higher rates ofasthma mortality, and greater morbidity as measured byhospital admissions and emergency room visits. Similarly,the higher rates of asthma morbidity among PacificIslander minority populations in New Zealand vividlyillustrate the link between socioeconomic status, access tohealth care, and clinical outcomes 19. Reviews118,119discuss the complex links between poverty and asthma. Costs of Asthma The cost of asthma has been documented in several differ- ent health care systems in developed countries, including 20 BURDEN OF ASTHMA COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEthe United States115,120,121, the United Kingdom113, Australia, and Sweden111,112. A detailed review of treatment costs in the Republic of Transkei, South Africa, provides a working model for the study of asthma costs in developingcountries 122. Analyses have emphasized the need to differ- entiate between direct and indirect costs123. Direct costs are relatively easy to measure and include the costs ofmedication, medical bills, and documented episodes ofhealth service utilization such as clinic visits and hospitaladmissions. Indirect costs include the adverse economicimpact of the disease on an individual, family, and society.This includes the \"cost\" of premature mortality and productivity loss. For the purpose of regional comparison direct costsare used. The cost of medical treatments for asthma can represent a substantial proportion of family income. In the UnitedStates, estimates of this cost range from 5.5 percent to14.5 percent of total family income 123,124. A comparable figure for the cost of asthma treatment in India is 9 percentof per capita annual income 108. Comparisons of the cost of asthma in different regionslead to a clear set of conclusions: Primary care is less expensive than hospital care Emergency treatment is more expensive than planned treatment Nurse-led treatment can be cost effective Families can suffer from the financial burden of treating asthma. Several studies in the United Kingdom have looked closely at the links between the process of clinical care andeconomic outcomes. One study showed that integratedprimary and secondary care was cost effective 125. Another study found that nurse-led intervention to improve thediagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma in primarycare led to a reduction in hospital care costs 126. It should be noted, however, that these positive outcomes tend todiminish over time, indicating a need to sustain theintensity of the intervention. Primary care of asthma by atrained asthma nurse may be associated with a favorableclinical outcome and, by implication, reduced healthservice costs 127. The cost of treating acute asthma attacks is far greater than the cost of providing preventive drugtreatment 128. Health Policy Asthma is a treatable disease with preventable morbidity129,130. Although the cost of preventive asthmatreatment seems high, the cost of not treating asthma correctly is even higher129,131-134. Proper treatment of the disease poses a challenge for individuals, health care professionals, health care organizations, andgovernments. Other chapters in this document focus onstrategies for asthma care that can by adopted byindividuals and health care professionals, but to trulyminimize the social and economic burden of asthma alsorequires action by health care organizations and publicagencies. Some ways in which health care organizationsand governments might address this problem include: Encourage primary care management of asthma Subsidize or encourage the use of preventive medications Maintain surveillance on key asthma processes and outcomes Make asthma a health service priority. There is every reason to believe that the substantial global burden of asthma can be dramatically reduced throughefforts by individuals, their health care providers, healthcare organizations, and local and national governments.

This chronic inflammation is associated with increasedairway responsiveness to a variety of stimuli and withrecurrent symptoms and reversible airflow limitation thatare characteristic of asthma. This chapter discusses riskfactors for asthma (Figure 3-1), in particular, (1) hostfactors involved in the development of asthma, and (2)environmental factors that may influence the susceptibilityto the development of asthma in predisposed individuals,cause exacerbations of asthma, and/or cause symptomsto persist. Host factors include the genetic predisposition to the development of either asthma or allergic sensitization,(i.e., atopy, defined as the production of abnormalamounts of IgE in response to environmental allergens),airway hyperresponiveness, gender, and race. Environmental factors modify the likelihood that asthma will develop in predisposed individuals. These factors include allergens, occupational sensitizers, tobaccosmoke, air pollution, respiratory (viral) infections, diet,socioeconomic status, and family size. Someenvironmental factors can also exacerbate asthma;these are also called precipitating factors.HOST FACTORS Genetic Predisposition to the Development of Asthma There is good evidence to indicate that asthma is a heritable disease. A number of studies have shown anincreased prevalence of asthma and the phenotypeassociated with asthma among the offspring of subjectswith asthma compared to the offspring of subjects withoutasthma 1-4. The phenotype associated with asthma can be defined by subjective measures (e.g., symptoms),objective measures (e.g., airway hyperresponsiveness orserum IgE level), or both. Because of the complex clinicalpresentation of asthma, the genetic basis of the disease is 28 RISK FACTORSKEY POINTS: Risk factors for asthma may be classified as host factors that predispose individuals to or protect them from developing asthma, and environmental factors that influence the susceptibility to the development ofasthma in predisposed individuals, precipitateasthma exacerbations, and/or cause symptoms topersist. Host factors include the genetic predisposition to the development of either asthma or atopy, airwayhyperresponsiveness, gender, and race. Exposure to allergens and occupational sensitizers, viral and bacterial infections, diet, tobacco smoke,socioeconomic status, and family size are the main environmental factors that influence the susceptibility to the development of asthma inpredisposed individuals. Exposure to allergens and respiratory (viral) infections are the main factors responsible forcausing exacerbations of asthma and/or thepersistence of symptoms.Figure 3-1.

This lack of a cleardefinition of the asthma phenotype presents the biggestproblem when reviewing studies of the genetic basis ofasthma and atopy, because multiple definitions of thesame intermediate phenotype are used in different studies 4. Family studies have convincingly shown that atopy (asmeasured by allergen skin tests, total IgE, and/or specificIgE), airway hyperresponsiveness, and asthma asdiagnosed by questionnaire are at least partly undergenetic control 2,4. Numerous studies of twins have demonstrated that concordance rates for asthma, eczema,and hay fever are all substantially higher for monozygoticthan for dizygotic twins, suggesting a strong geneticcontribution. In population-based studies of twins, theestimated effect of genetic factors is about 35 to 70percent, depending on the population and the design ofthe study 4,5.

The results of several studies provide an indication that multiple genes may be involved in thepathogenesis of asthma, and chromosomal regions likelyto harbor asthma susceptibility genes have been identified(Figure 3-2) 4-6. Genetic control of the immune response. Genes located in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexmay govern the specificity of the immune response tocommon aeroallergens in some individuals 7. The HLA gene complex is located on chromosome 6p and consistsof the class I, class II, and class III genes (including thehighly polymorphic genes for HLA class I and II molecules),and others such as the gene for tumor necrosis factor- /H9251 (TNF-/H9251 ). Many population studies have investigated associations between IgE responses to specific allergensand both HLA class II genes and T cell receptor (TCR)genes. The strongest reported association is that betweenthe HLA allele DRB1*15 and the response to Amb a vallergen 4,5. Genetic control of proinflammatory cytokines.Chromosomes 11, 12, and 13 contain several genes thatmay be important in the development of atopy andasthma 5. Evidence for linkage of a broadly defined allergic phenotype to markers on chromosome 11 was detected inthe early genetic studies of asthma 8,9. Chromosome 12 contains the genes encoding interferon- /H9253, mast cell growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and the constitutive formof nitric oxide synthase. A series of studies has identifieda positive linkage between markers on 12q, asthma, andIgE 4. Initial data are now also available for chromosomes 14 and 1910. Mutations of the cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 5have been hypothesized to predispose subjects to asthma 4,5. Several genes on chromosome 5q may be important in thedevelopment or progression of inflammation associatedwith asthma and atopy, including particular plays an essential role in the atopic immune response, both by causing differentiation ofTh2-like cells and by inducing IgE production by B cells.This makes the IL-4 gene, or genes for the factors that regulate its expression, strong candidate genes forpredisposition to atopy and asthma 4,5. Atopy Atopy, defined as the production of abnormal amounts of IgE antibodies in response to contact with environmentalallergens, is demonstrated by increased total or specificserum IgE and by a positive response to skin-prick testsusing a battery of standardized allergens, specific to eachgeographic zone. Atopy appears to be an important hostfactor that predisposes individuals to developing asthma.The available epidemiological evidence suggests that thepopulation-based proportion of asthma cases attributableto atopy is about 50 percent 11. The association between allergic sensitization and asthma is age dependent. Infact, the majority of children who become sensitized toaeroallergens during the first 3 years of life developasthma later in life, whereas children who becomesensitized after the age of 8 to 10 have a risk of developingasthma that is not much higher than that of children whodo not become sensitized 12. Figure 3-3 shows the prevalence of skin-prick-test positivity and asthma in population-based studiescomparing different populations or the same populationover time 11. The proportion of people with asthma who are skin-prick-test positive varies considerably betweendifferent studies. Although population-based studiessuggest an association between the prevalence of atopyand asthma 13or between the levels of IgE and asthma14,15, most studies report an inconsistent association betweenthe increase of atopy and the increase of asthma. Thissuggests that the importance of atopy as a cause ofasthma may have been overemphasized 44and that it should be considered only one of the factors, even if a very important one, needed for disease expression. Atopic diseases occur in families. Significant familial aggregation of asthma and associated phenotypes suchas airway hyperresponsiveness and total IgE levels havebeen described in numerous studies 4,5. Family studies have suggested that the atopic status of subjects withoutasthma does not influence the risk of asthma in theirrelatives, but the presence of atopy in subjects withasthma further enhances the likelihood of the relativesdeveloping asthma. Thus, although asthma and atopymay be inherited independently 25,26, the coincidence of asthma and atopy or atopic manifestations such aseczema in one individual greatly increases the risk ofasthma in her or his relatives. A family history of hay feveror atopic dermatitis, excluding asthma, is unrelated toasthma in the offspring. In contrast, the prevalence ofasthma alone, i.e., without concomitant hay fever or atopiceczema, increases strongly if nearest of kin suffer fromasthma alone, suggesting a separate genetic factorcontrolling the development of asthma 27. However, the risk of atopic parents with asthma having a child with asthmafurther increases when a family history of asthma isaccompanied by a history of atopy 28. Similarly, when both airway hyperresponsiveness and atopy are present in the 30 RISK FACTORS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEparents, the prevalence of asthma increases in the offspring28. Airway Hyperresponsiveness Airway hyperresponsiveness, a state in which the airways narrow too easily and too much in response to provokingstimuli, is a risk factor for asthma. The condition has aheritable component and is closely related to serum IgElevels and airway inflammation. A tendency to produce anelevated level of total serum IgE is co-inherited with airwayhyperresponsiveness, and a gene governing airwayhyperresponsiveness is located near a major locus thatregulates serum IgE levels on chromosome 5q 29. Asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine isa risk factor for asthma 30. However, it is not yet clear whether the development of airway hyperresponsivenessprecedes, coincides with, or follows the development ofsymptoms of asthma. Interestingly, asymptomatic airwayhyperresponsiveness is associated with airwayinflammation and remodeling 30,31, suggesting that airway inflammation may precede the onset of asthma. Gender and AsthmaChildhood asthma is more prevalent in boys than in girls 32. The increased risk for males in childhood is probably related to narrower airways, increased airway tone32-34, and possibly higher IgE35in boys, which predispose them to enhanced airflow limitation in response to a variety of insults.Further support for this hypothesis comes from theobservation that the difference disappears after age 10,when the airway diameter/length ratio is the same in both sexes, probably because of changes in thoracic sizethat occur with puberty in males but not in females 36-38. More females than males develop asthma during pubertyand thereafter, so the prevalence of adult asthmabecomes higher in females than in males. Interestingly,aspirin-induced asthma 39is more frequent in women. RISK FACTORS 31Figure 3-3.

COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTERace/Ethnicity and Asthma The majority of data indicate that socioeconomic and environmental factors are primarily responsible forapparent racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence ofasthma. Migrant studies suggest that subjects of differentraces may acquire the risk of the population they move to.The prevalence of wheezing is the same among childrenof different racial descent living in London or Australia 40. The much higher prevalence of wheezing in black thanwhite children living in the United States seems likely to bedue to socioeconomic and environmental factors 41. Thus, even though slight differences in asthma prevalencebetween different races living in the same region havebeen found in some studies 42, these differences may be attributable to socioeconomic conditions, allergenexposures, and dietary factors rather than to racialpredisposition. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TOTHE DEVELOPMENT OF ASTHMA IN PREDISPOSED INDIVIDUALS Allergens and occupational sensitizers have been considered the most important causes of asthma, with the understanding that they could first sensitize theairways and then keep asthma active by precipitatingasthma attacks or leading to the persistence of symptoms. Exposure to an allergen is an important risk factor for the development of atopic sensitization to that specificallergen 43,44, and exposure to allergens in sensitized individuals is a risk factor for asthma exacerbations and/orthe persistence of asthma symptoms 45. Thus, it has been speculated that exposure to an allergen is the cause ofasthma or at least of its manifestation and persistence.However, a major unresolved question is whetherexposure to allergens and occupational sensitizers isindeed the primary cause of the development of newasthma, or if this exposure merely triggers asthma attacksor leads to the persistence of symptoms in subjects whoalready have asthma 46. Several studies have suggested a correlation betweenallergen exposure and the prevalence of asthma 47-49, and have documented an improvement of asthma afterexposure to allergens ceases 17,50. However, no longitudinal study has firmly demonstrated that the level of allergenexposure during infancy is related to asthma risk later inlife 46. Indeed, even if exposure to allergens early in life is related to allergen sensitization, many factors maycontribute to the expression of asthma symptoms later inlife, current exposure to allergens being just one suchfactor. Two recent studies clearly show that early allergenexposure is indeed a risk factor for the development ofallergen sensitization but not for asthma, confirming thatallergy and asthma develop through separate pathwaysand mechanisms 51,52. Some cross-sectional13and prospective51studies have shown that exposure to some allergens may actually be negatively associated withcurrent expression of asthma 11. If the level of exposure to allergens, and particularly to mites, in early life is indeed crucial for allergic sensitizationand for the expression of asthma 53, children brought up in a mite-free environment at high altitude should have asignificantly lower prevalence of asthma and wheeze thanchildren from a humid, mite-infested area. However, twoindependent studies performed in the Alps and NewMexico failed to document a significant effect of a mite-freeenvironment on the occurrence of asthma 16,54. Other allergens (e.g., pet-derived allergens or Alternaria) foundin both environments may have played a role in producingthese results 55. The fact that allergen exposure may exacerbate asthma orcause symptoms to persist may lead to an increasedestimate of asthma prevalence (number of cases in agiven population) in epidemiological studies, even ifallergen exposure does not influence asthma incidence(new cases over time). Indeed, the allergen-specific IgE-mediated reaction may simply represent one of severalmechanisms that contribute to triggering acuteexacerbations of asthma or to maintaining chronic airwayinflammation and asthma symptoms without necessarilycausing new asthma. The presence of at least some form of occupational asthma or environmental asthma only in exposed subjectssuggests that some substances to which a subjectbecomes sensitized can cause the development ofasthma. The studies in Barcelona, where epidemics ofasthma exacerbations were traced to days when soybeanswere being unloaded at a specific silo without a filter,increased the awareness that small amounts of airborneallergen can cause major changes in the lungs ofsensitized people 56. The fact that those who came to the hospital were already atopic and allergic to the dustsuggested that sensitization can occur at low atmosphericconcentrations if the allergen is potent enough 57. In addition, the fact that most of those who came to thehospital already had asthma suggests that the primaryeffect of exposure to a sensitizing agent is most likelytriggering asthma exacerbations rather than causing theonset of new asthma. 32 RISK FACTORS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEIt has not been firmly established whether the exposure and sensitization to an occupational sensitizer is actuallythe cause of occupational asthma, or just one additionaltrigger of asthma exacerbations. Most of the studiesconducted in occupational asthma have involved smallgroups of subjects without proper controls, and the cause-effect relationship between the sensitizing agent and thedevelopment of asthma has been based on a positiveresponse after bronchoprovocation challenges. Asthmamay persist after long-term avoidance of the sensitizingagent in a significant proportion of subjects withoccupational asthma 58,59, but this observation does not illuminate the cause of occupational asthma, as it maysuggest either that asthma and occupational sensitizationare two independent events, or that once asthma isinduced by an occupational sensitizer it may persist evenin the absence of the causative agent. On the other hand, there is evidence that exposure to allergens and/or chemicals may indeed cause asthma, atleast in some subjects, particularly if the sensitizing agentis potent enough. Historical examples show asthma developing in most, if not all, subjects exposed to bees,platinum salts, and biological enzymes on the job 60. In a 5-year study of 277 workers employed in a new toluenediisocyanate manufacturing plant, an incidence of newcases of occupational asthma of up to 5 percent wasidentified 61. In another study, a 2.7 percent incidence of new cases of occupational asthma caused by animalallergens was found in previously healthy apprentices inanimal health technology 62. Indoor Allergens Indoor allergens include domestic (house dust) mites, animal allergens, cockroach allergen, and fungi. Indoorallergens today have increased in developed countrieswhere homes have been insulated for energy efficiency,carpeted, heated, cooled, and humidified -changes that have also made homes ideal habitat for domestic mites,cockroaches, other insects, molds, and bacteria 63,64. Domestic mites. Although mite allergens are carried in particles too large to penetrate the airways, there isevidence to suggest that domestic mites are the mostcommon indoor allergen associated with asthmaworldwide 48,65,66. However, as previously mentioned, early allergen exposure is a risk factor for the development ofallergen sensitization but not for asthma 51,52. House dust is composed of several organic and inorganiccompounds, including fibers, mold spores, pollen grains,insects and insect feces, mammalian danders, and mitesand mite feces. Domestic mite allergens are present invarious parts of mite bodies 67-69, secreta, and excreta and constitute the main source of dust-derived allergens. The principal domestic mite species are the D. farinae, D. microceras, and Euroglyphus mainei , which usually account for 90 percent of the mite species in house dustfrom temperate regions 70. Mites feed on human and animal scales colonized by microfungi, yeasts, andbacteria. Mites can be found in floors and tend to burythemselves deep in carpets, mattresses, and softfurnishings. Conditions for growth are a temperaturebetween 22 and 26 \u00b0C and a relative humidity greater than 55 percent (or an absolute humidity less than 8 g/kg). D. pteronyssinus is the dominant mite in constantly damp climates (Northern Europe, Brazil, and the Pacific Northwest). D. farinae survives better in drier climates and is the most prominent mite species in areas with prolongeddry winters. Another domestic mite of importance is Blomia tropicalis, commonly found in houses in tropical and subtropical areas, such as Brazil and Florida. In addition to the pyroglyphid mites, other mite species are found in house dust, cause development of IgE antibodyresponses, and may also be termed domestic mites.These include storage mites, which inhabit stored foodproducts and hay and require abundant food and highhumidity for survival. The most common species belong Glycyphagus, Acarus,Lepidoglyphus, Cortoglyphus, and been identified ascysteine proteases (group I allergens: D. pteronyssinus and amylase (group IV 71allergens). These allergenic enzymes have been found in mite fecalpellets. The group II allergens are derived mainly frommite bodies rather than from mite feces (D. pteronyssinusII,D. farinae II). The predominant allergens in house dust are from groups I and III; very little group II allergenhas been found in dust. Interestingly, the most importantmite allergens have proteolytic activity, and thus theymight have easier access to the immunocompetent cells. A concentration of mite allergen above 0.5 /H9262g of D. pteronyssinus I per gram of dust seems to be a significant risk factor for mite allergy, but a similar threshold level for provocation of asthma symptoms has not been clearlydefined 72-74. Animal allergens. Household warm-blooded excretions (e.g.,urine), and danders. RISK FACTORS 33 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTECats. Cat allergens are potent airway-sensitizing agents. The main allergenic protein (Fel d1) is found in cat pelt (especially in the facial area), sebaceous secretions, andurine, but not in saliva 75. This allergen is carried on small particles of about 3 to 4 microns in diameter, which easilybecome airborne and are responsible for the rapid onset ofrespiratory symptoms in cat-sensitized persons enteringan indoor environment containing a cat 72,76. While early exposure to cats may decrease rather than increase achild's risk of developing asthma 77, cat allergens may constitute a relevant risk factor for asthma exacerbationsand emergency room visits. Although households with acat contain higher quantities of cat allergen, private homeswithout a cat and public places (such as hospitals,cinemas, and public transport) may contain sufficientallergenic protein to induce clinical symptoms in highlysensitized subjects 73,78. The clothes of cat owners constitute the vehicle of passive transport of Fel d1 to cat-free environments 79. Dogs . Dogs produce two important allergenic proteins, Can f1 and Can f2. The characteristics of dog allergens(allergen-carrying particles, ubiquity, etc.) are similar tothose of cat allergens. Although a slight degree of cross-reactivity between cat and dog allergenic materials hasbeen demonstrated 71, allergic sensitivity to dogs is not as common as sensitivity to other mammals. Nevertheless,up to 30 percent of allergic individuals have positive skintests to dog extracts. Although the many breeds of dog(over 100) and the diversity of dog allergens createproblems in the randomization of extracts, a dog allergenhas been purified from dog hair and dander 80. Rodents . Many children keep rodents as pets, and there are inner-city areas where wild mice or rats are present.The allergenicity of rodent antigens is well known become sensitized to urinaryproteins 81. Cockroach allergen. In some locations and among some ethnic groups, sensitization to cockroach allergen may beas common as sensitization to domestic mite allergens.Most species of cockroaches live in tropical climates;however, central heating has enabled them to thriveoutside their normal habitat. The most common speciesare the American the German and American cockroacheshave been characterized, and their presence in house dustcan be measured by using specific monoclonalantibodies 82.Fungi. Molds and yeasts can act as indoor airborne allergens. Among these is Alternaria, which is an established risk factor for asthma in various populationsand has been associated with the risk of asthma death inthe United States 83,84. Dark, humid, and poorly ventilated areas are optimal for indoor fungal growth. Fungi growwell within the systems used for cooling, heating, andhumidification, with house humidifiers providing a specialrisk for indoor fungal growth and air contamination.Unfortunately, there are as yet no reliable methods ofmeasuring the concentration of indoor fungi. The mostcommon indoor fungi Penicillium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Outdoor Allergens The most common outdoor allergens that may lead to asthma in susceptible people are pollens and fungi. Pollens. Pollen allergens associated with asthma come mainly from trees, grasses, and weeds. Pollen allergens are carried in large particles, and it is not clear how theyreach the bronchi. Micron-sized particles of starchgranules are released from pollens, particularly afterrainfall, and seem to be responsible for pollen-inducedasthma exacerbations 87,88. The air concentration of pollens varies with location and at-mospheric condition, but in general, tree pollenspredominate in the early spring, grass pollens in the latespring and summer, and weed pollens during summer andfall. Clinical and aerobiological studies show that the pollenmaps are changing as a result of cultural factors (e.g.,importation of plants for urban parklands) and greaterinternational travel. Concentrations of Lol p1 (the majorallergen from rye grass, Lolium perenne) above 10 /H9262 g/g in house dust are associated with epidemics of pollen-induced exacerbations of asthma 89, increase of symptoms, increase of airway hyperresponsiveness, and airwayinflammation 90. While there is strong evidence that exposure to pollensmay trigger asthma exacerbations, there is yet noevidence that sensitization to pollens increases the risk ofdeveloping asthma 91. Fungi. Molds and yeasts can be outdoor airborne allergens. Alternaria and Cladosporium (which are also indoor fungi) are the only fungi that have been establishedas risk factors for asthma. Fungi tend to be seasonalallergens in temperate zones, where some fungi sporulateon warm, dry summer days, and others prefer the rainynights of fall 92,93. 34 RISK FACTORS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEOccupational Sensitizers An extensive list of occupational sensitizing agents has been reported94; Figure 3-4 provides an abbreviated listing. A continuously updated list on the Asmanetwebsite (http://asmanet.com) currently includes at least361 occupational agents shown to be involved inoccupational asthma. Occupational sensitizers are usually classified according to molecular weight. The mechanism of action of low-molecular-weight sensitizers remains largely unknown 95.High-molecular-weight sensitizers probably sensitizesubjects and cause asthma exacerbations by the samemechanisms as allergens. For example, acute exposureto irritant gases in the workplace or during accidents mayinduce a long-lasting airway hyperresponsiveness, whichwas formerly named reactive airway dysfunction syndromeand is now known as irritant-induced asthma. Irritant-induced asthma shares most of the clinical and physiologic characteristics of other forms of asthma 96. Its pathology is similar but not identical, being characterizedby increased airway mucosal mononuclear cells and RISK FACTORS 35Figure 3-4.

Tobacco Smoke Tobacco burning, which is a ubiquitous source of indoor irri- tants, produces a large and complex mixture of gases,vapors, and particulate matter. More than 4,500compounds and contaminants have been identified intobacco smoke, among them respirable particles, polycyclichydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitricoxide, nitrogen oxides, nicotine, and acrolein. Passive smoking. There is evidence that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (i.e., passive smoking) increases the risk of lower respiratory tract illnesses in utero 98, in infancy99, and in childhood100,101. Sidestream smoke, which burns hotter and is more toxic than thesmoke inhaled by the tobacco user, is particularly irritatingto the respiratory mucosa. Smoking by a child's motherduring pregnancy plus smoking by any member of thehousehold after the child is born increases the child's riskof developing asthma and wheeze 102,103. The effects of environmental tobacco smoke exposure on adult asthmahave not yet been investigated extensively and theavailable data are limited 104. Active smoking. While active smoking may increase the risk of developing occupational asthma in workersexposed to some occupational sensitizers (e.g., acidanhydrides) 105, there is still limited evidence that active smoking is a risk factor for the development of asthma.However, active smoking is associated with accelerateddecline of lung function in people with asthma, greaterasthma severity 106, and poor response to asthma treatment107, supporting the concept that active smoking may contribute to asthma severity even withoutcontributing to the development of asthma 106. Air Pollution Air pollution is defined as the atmospheric accumulation of irritants to a degree that becomes injurious to humans, animals, or plants. Both outdoor and indoor irritantscontribute to air pollution. Outdoor pollutants. There are two main types of outdoor pollution: industrial smog (sulfur dioxide particulate complex) and photochemical smog (ozone and nitrogenoxides), and they can coexist in a given area. Levels of airpollutants are affected by weather conditions and localgeographic features. Several studies have implicatedvarious pollutants as aggravating asthma 108, mainly in experiments with controlled chamber exposure. However,because of the great number of variables, epidemiologicalstudies trying to link the rising trend of asthma withambient pollution have been inconclusive. Some studieshave shown a significant association of air pollutants suchas ozone, nitrogen oxides, acidic aerosols, and particulatematter with symptoms and exacerbations of asthma. It ispossible that chronic exposure to pollution may predisposeto respiratory disease in a more subtle and complicatedmanner. Environmental pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen oxides can, at concentrations found in heavilypolluted cities, trigger bronchoconstriction, transientlyincrease airway responsiveness, and enhance allergicresponses. Thus, in theory, pollution might indeedcontribute to the development of asthma. However,although asthma seems to be more frequent inindustrialized countries, there is little, if any, evidence thatair pollution is directly responsible for the increasedprevalence of asthma in these countries 44. The role of air pollution in the development of asthma andallergy was studied by comparing the prevalence ofrespiratory disorders in school children living in twoGerman cities: the eastern city of Leipzig, with its heavyindustrial pollution, and the western city of Munich, with itsheavy automobile traffic. Asthma and allergy weresignificantly more prevalent in Munich, while bronchitiswas more prevalent in Leipzig 109. This difference was related, among various factors, to the type of air pollution:in Munich, vehicle emissions (nitrogen dioxide andrespirable particulate matter) predominated, whereas inLeipzig the air pollution contained high concentrations ofsulfur dioxide from high-sulfur coal burned for heating andenergy production. Subsequent studies 24demonstrated that the prevalence of hay fever in Leipzig schoolchildrenincreased from 2 to 3 percent in 1991-92 to 5.1 percent in1995-96 (i.e., 6 to 7 years after the reunification ofGermany), while the prevalence of all IgE-mediatedsensitizations increased from 19.3 percent in 1991-92 to26.7 percent in 1995-96. Thus, the difference inprevalence of allergic disorders formerly observedbetween eastern and western Germany is progressivelydecreasing as motor vehicle traffic and the consequentforms of air pollution increase in the former East Germany. Exposure to traffic, particularly to diesel exhaust, may exacerbate preexisting allergic conditions but does notnecessarily induce the development of new cases ofasthma and atopy 110. Diesel particles have also been shown to absorb allergens from grass pollen onto their surface and may therefore act as potential carriers toincrease deposition of pollen allergens in the lung 111-113. In this way, both the allergen dose and the antigenicity of the 36 RISK FACTORS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEpollen allergen may be enhanced by automobile-related pollution114. Indoor pollutants. The contaminants and atmospheric dynamics of indoor air pollution are different from those ofoutdoor air pollution. Modern construction techniquespossibly contribute to greater indoor pollution by loweringthe turnover of indoor air. An increased indoor pollutantload may be in addition to the increased antigen load (inparticular, from the feces of domestic mites) produced bychanges in house design and forms of heating andfurnishing (especially the use of carpets and upholsteredfurniture). Because very young children spend most oftheir time indoors, and because residents of developedcountries also spend 90 to 95 percent of their time indoors,indoor pollutants are important to consider. However,each home indoor environment is unique, and air qualitymay vary from house to house and even from room to room. Major indoor pollutants are nitric oxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide,formaldehyde, and biologicals such as endotoxin 115. Sources of these indoor pollutants include the following: Cooking with natural gas or liquid propane, which produces carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulfurdioxide, nitric oxide, and nitrogen oxides Cooking on wood, kerosene, or coal-burning stoves,which produces carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, andsulfur dioxide as well as respirable particles Heating with gas, wood, coal, and kerosene units andfireplaces, which produces carbon monoxide, carbondioxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen oxides, respirable particles,and particulate soot 116 Building and furnishing with foam installations, glues,fireboard, pressed board, plywood, particle board, carpetbacking, and fabrics that contain the volatile organic com-pound formaldehyde, and using paints or other materialsthat release isocyanates. Some data suggest that indoor pollutants may contributeto the development of asthma, but further studies areneeded. Among the problems related to indoor pollutionare nose irritation, respiratory infections and bronchitis,and lung cancer as a result of respirable particles; noseirritation, impaired lung function, and increased infectionsin children as a result of nitrogen oxides; and difficulty inbreathing and asthma symptoms as a result offormaldehyde 117. Respiratory Infections Respiratory infections have a complex relationship with asthma. Such infections early in life have been associatedwith both increased and decreased risk for thedevelopment of asthma, and infections at any time of lifeare associated with the onset of exacerbations. Epidemiologic evidence confirms that acute respiratory viral infections cause asthma exacerbations in both adultsand children 118,119. The major respiratory virus types and the conditions they are most associated with are listed inFigure 3-5 118. Each respiratory virus is capable of causing almost any respiratory condition, depending on the siteand dose of virus inoculated and the degree of host predis-position 118. The most common respiratory viruses in infancy are respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), whichcause approximately 50 percent of all wheezing illnessesand 80 percent of cases of bronchiolitis in this agegroup 118. Parainfluenza virus is also an important cause of bronchiolitis and croup in infancy, while common coldviruses such as rhinoviruses are the principal triggers ofwheezing in older children and adults with asthma 120. Bacterial infections, particularly with Chlamydia pneumoniae, in infancy have been suggested to play arole in the development of asthma later in life, although theavailable evidence only demonstrates associationsbetween chronic bacterial infection of the airways andsevere asthma and between bacterial infections and RISK FACTORS 37Figure 3-5.

Several studies have demonstrated an association between viral respiratory infections, particularly RSV bronchiolitis, in early life andlater development of asthma or pulmonary functionabnormalities, including airway hyperresponsiveness 123,124. One study confirmed that RSV bronchiolitis is the mostimportant risk factor for the development of wheezing,asthma, and atopic sensitization in children followed up to7 years of age 125. Another study has clearly shown that not only RSV infections but also other severe respiratory viralinfections in the first 3 years of life are associated withincreased risk of wheeze during childhood up to 13 yearsof age 119. There is increasing evidence that infants with RSV bronchiolitis have impaired type 1 immunity andaugmented type 2 immunity, thus putting them at risk forthe development of allergic sensitization and developmentof severe respiratory tract infections (due to impairedantiviral immunity) early in life. These infants are also atrisk for the development of wheezing illness and asthmalater in life on reexposure to allergens and viral infections. There is thus a clear association between severe viral respiratory infections early in life and the development ofasthma in childhood. There is also evidence that thisassociation is mediated by a common preexistingimbalance in immunity (deficient type 1 and augmentedtype 2 immunity). However, it is not yet clear whether viralinfections early in childhood can affect the development ofthe immune system and thereby modify the risk for thesubsequent development of allergies and asthma 119. In contrast to the above evidence, a recent large epidemio-logic study completed in Germany 126has clearly shown a protective effect of frequent upper respiratory infections(sniffles) during the first year of life on the risk of laterdevelopment of atopy and asthma, even in children with afamily history of atopic diseases. Similar data from the United States (Tucson, Arizona) also show that conditions associated with increased respiratoryinfections early in life (having a larger number of siblingsand attending day care) also protect against thedevelopment of asthma 127. These data are in accordance with the hygiene hypothesis (see below) but appear tocontradict the positive associations between respiratoryinfections and asthma discussed above. This apparentcontradiction can be resolved by understanding thatindividual severe infections early in life (such as RSVbronchiolitis) are a marker of impaired type 1 immunity andare therefore associated with increased risk for thedevelopment of asthma later in life. In contrast, measuresreflecting an increased overall load of infectious disease(such as frequent sniffles 121or day care attendance128) identify children whose immune systems are more likely todevelop successfully with type 1 responses as a result ofenvironmental stimulation, placing these children atreduced risk of developing asthma later in life. A possible link between mycobacterial infection and reduced risk of allergy was suggested by a study of 867Japanese children who underwent routine tuberculin testsprior to Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination at ages 6 and 12 years. An inverse relationship was observedbetween delayed hypersensitivity to tuberculin at the ageof 12 and both total and allergen-specific serum IgE levelsat the same age 129. The authors interpreted this as evidence that prior infection with tuberculosis orenvironmental mycobacteria might protect against thedevelopment of allergy. However, the same data may simply suggest that atopic/asthmatic subjects may have aless prominent tuberculin response. Conflicting data havebeen reported on the relationship between BCG vaccinationand the development of atopy and asthma 130. The role of other vaccinations, including those for measles andpertussis 131, has been questioned. The hygiene hypothesis. Improvement in hygiene and reduced recirculation of common infections is stronglyassociated with the increasing prevalence of atopy andatopic diseases in Western countries 132. Respiratory allergy is less frequent in people heavilyexposed to orofecal and foodborne microbes. Hygieneand a Westernized, semisterile atopy byinfluencing the pattern of commensals andpathogens that stimulate the gut-associated lymphoidtissue, thus contributing to the epidemic of allergic asthmaand rhinitis in developed countries 132. The most consistent evidence of an inverse relationship between infection andallergy is known from studies of hepatitis A 133. Another factor that confers protection against thedevelopment of atopy and asthma is growing up on afarm 134. Living conditions of farming families differ in many respects from those of other families: larger family size,more pets, frequent heating with wood or coal, lessmaternal smoking, more dampness, and different dietaryhabits. None of these factors, however, explains thestrong inverse association between atopy and growing upon a farm. Instead, contact with livestock and poultry hasbeen found to explain much of the relationship betweenfarming and reduced prevalence of atopy 135. The prevalence of atopy is lower in children from anthroposophic families than in children from otherfamilies. (Anthroposophy is a 20th century religioussystem growing out of theosophy.) This suggests thatsome factors associated with an anthroposophic lifestyle 38 RISK FACTORS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE(e.g., restricted use of antibiotics, few vaccinations, and a diet containing live lactobacilli) may lessen the risk of atopy in childhood 136. Parasitic Infections The results of studies that include egg counts suggest that subjects with asthma have a lower parasitic burden thannormal subjects. Similarly, African children with urinaryschistosomiasis have been reported to have a lowerprevalence of atopy than those free of this infection 137. Although epidemiological studies suggest that asthma isless common where intestinal parasitism is endemic, case-control studies show either no association or an increasein parasitism in people with asthma 138. Overall, the available data neither refute nor support the theories that parasiticdisease either protects against or causes asthma 128. Socioeconomic Status Another feature of the epidemiology of allergic disease for which the hygiene hypothesis offers an explanation is thesocioeconomic gradient -that is, the higher prevalence of childhood asthma and atopic diseases found in developednations than in developing nations, and the greaterprevalence of these diseases in affluent than poor regionsin the developing world 139. The socioeconomic status of families may be a surrogate measure of lifestylecharacteristics rather than a measure of risk factors per se. These lifestyle characteristics may include dietary habits,family size, access to health care, passive smoking,allergen exposure, or other, yet-unknown determinants 44. Family Size Studies have indicated an inverse relationship between asthma and family size: having no siblings or one sibling isassociated with an increased risk of asthma comparedwith having more than one sibling 140,141. Many authors have shown that the number of siblings is also inversely relatedto the prevalence of inhalant allergy 142, hay fever143, and asthma, suggesting that exposure of young children toolder children at home protects against the development ofasthma and frequent wheezing later in childhood 127. Diet and Drugs A Cochrane review concluded that an antigen-avoidance diet during pregnancy is unlikely to substantially reducethe risk of giving birth to an atopic child. Moreover, such adiet may have an adverse effect on maternal and/or fetalnutrition 144. Conflicting data have been reported about the protective role of breast feeding in the development ofasthma.Although the relationship between food sensitivity and the development of asthma is still uncertain, there is someevidence that food allergy in infancy is followed by asthma.Children with food-sensitive enteropathies and colitis havea higher subsequent prevalence of asthma, which isprobably more indicative of a predisposition to developallergies than of the food actually causing asthma. Because omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in vitro, there have been several studies to determine whether fish in thediet is associated with a lower prevalence of asthma 145,146. However, a Cochrane analysis147indicated there is little evidence to recommend that people with asthma supplementor modify their dietary intake of fish oil in order to improvetheir asthma control. Equally, there is no evidence thatthey are at risk if they do so. The consumption of fruit rich in vitamin C, even at a low level, may reduce wheezing symptoms in childhood,especially among already susceptible individuals 147,148. The severity of asthma, though not its development, hasbeen linked to increased salt intake, but only in men 149. It is widely believed that allergic reactions to foods or drugs may cause asthma and particularly that aspirin andother nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be an important cause of adult-onset asthma. Whilethere is solid evidence that NSAIDs may cause asthmaexacerbations in a significant proportion of people withasthma, there is so far no convincing evidence that these drugs can actually cause the development ofasthma 150,151. Obesity Despite the inherent difficulty in associating two common disorders, there is some evidence of a correlation betweenhigher body mass index (BMI) and greater risk of developingasthma 152-154. In addition, there is some evidence that weight loss improves lung function (particularly PEFvariability) 155, symptoms, morbidity, and health status156 in obese patients with asthma, suggesting that obesity might contribute to the worsening of respiratorysymptoms and quality of life in people with asthma. FACTORS THAT PRECIPITATE ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS AND/OR CAUSE SYMPTOMS TO PERSIST Triggers are risk factors that cause asthma exacerbations by inducing inflammation or provoking acute RISK FACTORS 39 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEbronchoconstriction, or both. Triggers vary from person to person and from time to time. They include furtherexposures to causal factors (allergens and occupationalagents) that have already sensitized the airways of theperson with asthma. Triggers also include exercise, cold air, drugs, irritant gases, weather changes, and extreme emotionalexpression. These triggers cannot cause asthma todevelop initially but can exacerbate asthma once it ispresent. Taking a careful history is necessary inattempting to identify each individual 's triggers. In this section, allergens, air pollutants, respiratoryinfections, exercise and hyperventilation, weatherchanges, sulfur dioxide, foods, additives, and drugs, andextreme emotional expression are briefly discussed in theirrole as asthma triggers. Other factors that may causeexacerbations, including rhinitis, sinusitis, polyposis,gastroesophageal reflux, menstruation, and pregnancy,are also briefly examined. Allergens Once the subject is sensitized, indoor and outdoor allergens can cause asthma exacerbations. Recentstudies have proved that very small amounts of airborneallergens are able to cause asthma exacerbations andmajor changes in the lungs of sensitized people 157. The mechanisms by which subsequent exposure to allergensmay cause asthma exacerbations and maintain chronicairway inflammation in asthma are described in thechapter on mechanisms of asthma. Air PollutantsChildren with asthma who are exposed to maternal smoking have higher requirements for medication andmore frequent emergency department visits 158,159. Other irritants, such as wood smoke, household sprays, volatileorganic compounds (e.g., polishes and cooking oils), andair pollutants, may also exacerbate asthma. Increased air stagnation was shown to be a surrogate for accumulation of the products of incomplete combustion, in-cluding carbon monoxide and fine particulate levels oforganic and elemental carbon, and is strongly associatedwith asthma exacerbations 160. An important factor that can act as a trigger is exposure tovehicle traffic, particularly diesel exhaust, which mightexacerbate preexisting allergic conditions. The role ofdiesel exhaust in the development of new cases of atopyand asthma is still uncertain 161. Finally, the airwayresponses to allergen may be enhanced by simultaneousexposure to air pollutants, constituting a potentialamplifying mechanism 44,162. Respiratory Infections In contrast to the slight evidence of a pathogenetic role of viral infections in the development of asthma, it is wellestablished that viral respiratory infections can exacerbateasthma 163. RSV, rhinovirus164, and influenza virus have been implicated123, with rhinovirus being implicated in the majority of the exacerbations of asthma in children165. The role of infections as triggers also appears to be importantin adults 163. Respiratory viruses may exacerbate asthma throughvarious mechanisms. Viral infections may cause epithelialdamage and airway inflammation, both of which may leadto asthma symptoms. Virus-specific IgE antibody hasbeen identified for RSV and for the parainfluenza virus,and these viruses may be responsible for the generationand release of allergic mediators from human lung cells 166. In addition, at least one virus has been shown to potentiatethe allergic response to allergens by increasing the release of inflammatory mediators and the cascade ofinflammatory events characteristic of asthma 167. Exercise and Hyperventilation Exercise is probably the most common trigger of brief episodes of symptoms. Exercise incites airflow limitationin most children and young adults who have asthma 168. The mechanisms of exercise-induced airflow limitation aremainly related to changes in the airway mucosa inducedby the associated hyperventilation, to either cooling orrewarming, or to changes in the osmolarity of fluid liningthe airway mucosa. Exercise appears to be a specificstimulus for people with asthma, because it seldom leadsto airflow limitation in people without asthma, even thosewith other airway diseases, such as chronic bronchitis,cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis 169. Hyperventilation with cold, dry, or even hot air can cause asthma exacerbationsthrough unknown mechanisms. Like exercise,hyperventilation seems to be a specific trigger forasthma 170,171. Weather Changes Adverse weather conditions, such as freezing temperatures, high humidity, and episodes of acutepollution brought on by weather conditions have beenassociated with asthma exacerbations, but these factorshave not been examined systematically and in depth 172,173. Epidemics of asthma exacerbations associated with 40 RISK FACTORS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEthunderstorms may be related to increased concentrations of allergenic particles associated with the downdraft of thestorm, which sweeps up pollen grains and particles and con-centrates them in a shallow band of air at ground level 174. Sulfur Dioxide Sulfur dioxide can trigger a dose-dependent airflow limitation in patients with asthma, although it has no effecton the airways of normal subjects up to very highconcentrations 175. Airflow limitation may be incited by sulfur dioxide at concentrations as low as 1 ppm, a leveleasily encountered in the workplace or elsewhere in theenvironment 176,177. Foods, Additives, and Drugs It is widely believed that allergic reactions to foods are common asthma triggers, but documented evidence isdifficult to find. Some ingested substances, includingsalicylates, food preservatives, monosodium some food-coloring asthma symptomsin some patients. Preservatives in many beverages(including wine and beer) and in some foods containmetabisulfite, which may release sufficient sulfur dioxide toprovoke bronchoconstriction 178. In about 4 to 28 percent (depending on the studymethodology) of adults with asthma -particularly in those with nasal polyps and sinusitis -but rarely in children with asthma, NSAIDs may cause asthma exacerbations. Themajority of these patients first experience symptoms duringthe third to fourth decade of life, but it is still unclear whatproportion of them have preexisting asthma rather thannewly developed asthma. Thus, it remains to beestablished whether aspirin and related drugs cause thedevelopment of asthma or, more likely, simply act astriggers of asthma albeit through highly specificmechanisms. Once NSAID intolerance develops, it ispresent for life 150,151. Beta blockers can provoke bronchoconstriction in asthmapatients by blocking beta-receptors to endogenouscatecholamine 179. In a few subjects, the inhalation of heroin has triggered the development of status asthmaticus180. Drugs or agents that can induce bronchospasm are listed inFigure 3-6. Extreme Emotional ExpressionEmotional stress may be a trigger for asthma exacerbations, primarily because extreme expressions oflaughing, crying, anger, or fear can lead to hyperventilationand hypocapnia, which can cause airway narrowing 181,182.Panic attacks, which are rare but not exceptional in somepatients with asthma, have a similar effect 183,184. However, it is important to note that asthma is not a psychosomaticdisorder. Other Factors That May Exacerbate AsthmaRhinitis, sinusitis, and polyposis are sometimes associated with asthma, and the treatment of each of these conditionsis often associated with improvement of asthma 185. For example, there is indirect evidence that bacterial sinusitismay have a role in asthma exacerbations, becauseantibiotic treatment of bacterial sinusitis is shown to reducethe severity of asthma 185. However, sinusitis and asthma may simply coexist. Apart from sinusitis, there is littleevidence that bacterial infections can exacerbate asthma.Gastroesophageal reflux can exacerbate asthma,especially in children, and asthma sometimes improveswhen the reflux is corrected 186,187. Many women complain that their asthma is worse at the time of menstruation, andpremenstrual exacerbations have been documented 188. Similarly, asthma may improve, worsen, or remainunchanged during pregnancy 189. REFERENCES 1. Sibbald B, Horn ME, Gregg I. A family study of the genetic basis of asthma and wheezy bronchitis.

Characteristic features of the airway inflammation are increased numbersof activated eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, and Tlymphocytes in the airway mucosa and lumen. Thesechanges may be present even when asthma isasymptomatic, and their extent appears to be broadlyrelated to the clinical severity of the disease 1,2. In parallel with the chronic inflammatory process, injury of thebronchial epithelium stimulates processes of repair thatresult in structural and functional changes referred to as\"remodeling\" 3. The recurrent episodes of symptoms and reversible airflow limitation that characterize asthmarepresent an acute inflammatory response acting uponstructurally and functionally altered airways. AIRWAY INFLAMMATION IN ASTHMA Airway inflammation in asthma is extremely complex inorigin, regulation, and outcome. The mechanisms involvea cascade of events involving many different kinds of cells, factors, and mediators that interact to create thecharacteristic inflammatory and tissue remodelingprocesses of asthma. Immunologic Mechanisms of Airway InflammationThe immune system is separable into antibody-mediated and cell-mediated processes 4. Antibody-mediated processes are characterized by production and secretionof specific antibodies by B lymphocytes, while cell-mediatedprocesses depend on T lymphocytes. T cells control Blymphocyte function and also exert proinflammatoryactions through cytotoxic activity (by CD8+ \"killer\" T cells) and the secretion of cytokines. In many cases, especially in children and young adults, asthma is associated with atopy manifesting throughimmunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent mechanisms 5. At a population level, the contribution of atopy to the asthmaphenotype has been estimated to be 40 percent in bothchildren and adults 6. Nonanaphylactogenic anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (E-25) is able to markedly attenuatethe early and late airway responses, the increase in airwayhyperresponsiveness, and the influx of eosinophils into theairway lumen that follow inhaled allergen challenge. Thisanti-IgE antibody is also effective in improving asthma control in clinical trials. These observations provideunequivocal evidence for a pivotal role of IgE in aproportion of asthma patients 7,8. At least two distinct T-helper (Th), CD4+lymphocyte subtypes have been characterized on the basis of theirprofile of cytokine production 9-11. Although both ) IL-9, IL-13, and IL-16.

IL-4 is a cytokine central to the allergic response, promoting isotype switching of B cells to IgE synthesis, 50 MECHANISMS OF ASTHMAKEY POINTS: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways with recurrent exacerbations. Chronic airway inflammation is invariably associated with injury and repair of the bronchial epithelium,which results in structural and functional changesknown as remodeling. Inflammation, remodeling, and altered neural control of the airways are responsible for both recurrentexacerbations of asthma and more permanentairflow obstruction. The potential to develop excessive airway narrowing is the major functional abnormality in asthma. Excessive airway narrowing is caused by altered smooth muscle behavior, in close interaction withairway wall swelling, parenchymal retractile forces,and intraluminal secretions. Exacerbations of asthma are associated with an increase in airway inflammation and, in susceptibleindividuals, can be induced by respiratory infections,allergen exposure, or exposure to occupationalsensitizers. Respiratory failure in asthma is a consequence of airway closure, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, andrespiratory muscle exhaustion.

IL-13, another Th2 cytokine that has multiple effects on immune and structural components involved inasthma, may also prove a target for therapy 14. A pivotal step in the generation of an immune response isthe activation of T lymphocytes by antigen appropriatelypresented to them by accessory cells, a process thatinvolves major histocompatibility complex (MHC)molecules (MHC class II molecules on CD4+T cells and MHC class I molecules on CD8+T cells). Dendritic cells are the primary antigen presenting cells in the airways.They originate from precursors in the bone marrow 15and form an extensive network of interdigitating cells beneaththe airway epithelium. From this location they migrate tolocal lymphoid collections under the influence ofgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a cytokine released from activated epithelial cells,fibroblasts, T cells, macrophages, and mast cells.Following antigen uptake, which is enhanced by cell-surface IgE, dendritic cells move into lymphocyte-enrichedregions. There, under the influence of additionalcytokines, they mature into effective antigen presentingcells 16. Dendritic cells can also drive the polarization of naive T-helper cells (Th0) towards the Th2 subtype thatcoordinately secretes cytokines in cluster onchromosome 5q31-33 (IL-4 gene cluster) ( Figure 4-1). The presence of activated lymphocytes and eosinophils inbronchial biopsies of atopic and nonatopic patients withasthma suggests that a T-lymphocyte-eosinophilinteraction is important, a hypothesis further supported bythe finding of cells expressing IL-5 in bronchial biopsies ofatopic patients with asthma 17,18. IL-5 is an important cytokine for eosinophil regulation, its level of expression inthe airway mucosa of patients with asthma correlating withmarkers of both T lymphocyte and eosinophil activation 11,17. Intrinsic Nonallergic Asthma People with intrinsic asthma show negative skin tests and have no clinical or family history of atopy. Their serumtotal IgE concentrations frequently fall within the normalrange and there is no evidence of specific IgE antibodiesdirected against common allergens. This form of asthma is associated with nasal polyps and aspirin sensitivity, itsonset is often preceded by a history of respiratory virusinfection, and it disproportionately affects females.Patients with intrinsic asthma are usually older than theirallergic counterparts and their clinical course is often more severe. The Swiss SAPALDIA survey of 8,357adults between the ages of 18 and 60 revealed that up to a third of all cases of asthma could be categorized asnonallergic 19. Ever since the first description of intrinsic asthma, therehas been debate about the relationship of this variant ofthe disease to atopy. One suggestion is that intrinsicasthma represents a form of autoimmunity, or autoallergy,triggered by infection. Others have suggested that peoplewith intrinsic asthma are simply sensitized to an as-yetundetected allergen 20. Although intrinsic asthma has a different clinical profile than atopic asthma, it is not adistinct immunopathological entity. Airway biopsies of subjects with intrinsic asthma show a Th2 cytokine profilewith accompanying inflammatory cells, just as in atopicasthma 21. A small proportion of intrinsic asthma cases may have their origins in the workplace with unrecognizedIgE or non-IgE sensitization to reactive chemicals (vide infra). Acute Inflammation Inhaled allergen challenge in allergic patients leads to an early allergic response, and in some cases this is followedby a late-phase response. The early response resultsfrom the activation of cells bearing allergen-specific IgE,especially mast cells 22and macrophages23. In patients with a strong allergic component to their asthma, basophils MECHANISMS OF ASTHMA 51Figure 4-1. Pathogenesis of Asthma COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEmay also contribute. Cross linkage of cell-bound IgE initiates a series of biochemical PGD2, C4 24, adenosine, and reactive oxygen25. of smooth afferent hypersecretion,vasodilation, and microvascular leakage 26(Figure 4-2). The late-phase response has been considered a model system to study the mechanisms of inflammation inasthma 27,28. During the late-phase response and during natural allergen exposure, activated airway cells releasecytokines and chemokines into the circulation, stimulatingthe release of inflammatory leukocytes, especiallyeosinophils and their precursors, from the bone marrowinto the circulation 29,30. Recruitment of Inflammatory Cells Into the Airways Peripheral blood cells including eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes are recruited into inflamed airways. This process begins with theupregulation of a series of endothelial adhesion moleculesby selective inflammatory mediators. These adhesion mol-ecules attach to their ligands expressed on the rollingleukocytes, resulting in firm adhesion of the leukocytes tomicrovascular endothelial cells 31, then migration across the endothelium and into the perivascular space. Cell-associated chemokines also play a key role in theseprocesses, interacting with receptors on leukocytes andcooperating with the eosinophilopoietic cytokines IL-5 andGM-CSF to help initiate and direct migration and primeleukocytes for enhanced mediator secretion 32,33. Cell Survival in Airway Tissues The survival of inflammatory cells in airway tissues depends on exogenous factors. Under normalcircumstances, apoptosis (programmed cell death) ofinflammatory cells limits inflammatory tissue injury andpromotes resolution rather than progression ofinflammation 34,35. In asthma, survival of activated inflammatory cells such as eosinophils is greatly increasedas a consequence of reduced apoptosis 36-38. Many of the cytokines and chemokines, and certain of the matrixmolecules, that are overexpressed in the airways of peoplewith asthma enhance inflammatory cell survival 39. 52 MECHANISMS OF ASTHMA Figure 4-2. Inflammation and Remodeling in Asthma COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTESite of the Inflammation in Asthma In nocturnal asthma the peribronchial airways and alveoli may be the site of inflammation40,41, but asthma is predominantly a disorder that affects the conducting airways.It is accepted that both central and peripheral airways areinflamed and that inflammation occurs both inside andoutside the smooth muscle layer, a fact that has implicationsfor the optimal delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs. Thereason for the preferential involvement of the conductingairways in asthma inflammation is not known, but most likelyrelates to specific properties of the airway epithelium. In addition to being a physiological barrier, the bronchial epithelium has an important role in directing theinflammatory response (Figure 4-2). It is still customary toconsider allergic asthma as primarily an immune disorder,but an equally valid model is one of epithelial malfunctionin which the response to injury or stress (e.g., viruses,pollutants, allergens) induces the microenvironment thatfacilitates the development of a Th2 response. Epithelialcells are source of cytokines and chemokines (e.g., GM-CSF, eotaxin, RANTES) that are capable of sustainingeosinophilic inflammation and of secreting mast cell growthfactors such as IL-6 and stem cell factor. Increasedcommunication between an activated epithelium andsubmucosal mesenchymal cells also has the capacity tocause the release of large quantities of eosinophilic andmast-cell-promoting cytokines. Considering epithelialmalfunction a primary abnormality in asthma also enablesan explanation of asthma that is not linked to IgE, such as intrinsic (late-onset) asthma, aspirin-intolerant asthma(due to defective PGE2 production), and occupationalasthma arising from exposure to reactive chemicals, such as isocyanates, where epithelial conjugates havebeen demonstrated. Constitutive Cells of Airway InflammationIn asthma normal resident cells of the airways (fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells)release an array of cytokines and growth factors that maycontribute to the chronic nature of airway inflammation. Fibroblasts play a key role in the remodeling and inflammatory processes. They produce collagen, reticularand elastic fibers, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins of the amorphous extracellular matrix (ECM) 42. Their biological activity is regulated by a range of cytokines and growth factors. Although fibroblasts are regarded asfixed cells of the ECM, they retain the capacity for growthand regeneration and may evolve into various cell types,including smooth muscle cells, becoming myofibroblasts 43 and possibly smooth muscle. Myofibroblasts contribute to tissue remodeling by releasing ECM components such as interstitial collagens,fibronectin, and laminin 44, and by producing growth factors for blood vessels, nerves, and smooth muscle. Increasednumbers of myofibroblasts are found in the airways ofpeople with asthma and their number has been correlatedwith the thickness of the reticular basement membrane 45. Following bronchial allergen challenge, myofibroblastsincrease in numbers in airway biopsies, raising thepossibility of their migration towards the basementmembrane from deeper in the airway wall 46. The ability of myofibroblasts to promote tissue remodelingis influenced by bronchial epithelial cells, which whenactivated or damaged release profibrogenic growth factorssuch as transforming growth factor- /H9252(TGF-/H9252 ) 47,48. One explanation for the promotion of remodeling bymyofibroblasts is that the altered epithelial phenotyperenders the epithelium unable to respond to injury or stressby appropriate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated repair, leading to increased cytokine andprofibrogenic growth factor production 49,50. While there is evidence for impaired epithelial proliferative responses inasthma and increased expression of inhibitors of cellcycling, the precise molecular mechanisms that result inremodeling have yet to be elucidated 51. In vitro studies suggest that smooth muscle cells are an important source of proinflammatory cytokines in asthma52. In addition to their capacity for contraction, airway smooth muscle cells have cytokine and mediator syntheticand secretory potential in vitro 53. They participate in chronic airway inflammation by interacting with mast cells,eosinophils, activated T lymphocytes, andmonocytes/macrophages. Smooth muscle cells also havethe potential to alter the composition of the ECMmicroenvironment and to orchestrate key events in airwayremodeling 54. Whether these events occur in vivo in the airways of people with asthma is not known, since themajority of observations on smooth muscle cells haverelied on cultures, most frequently obtained from resectedlung specimens. Inflammatory Cells Eosinophils. In chronic asthma, an increased number of activated eosinophils are found in bronchial biopsies 2, most frequently beneath the basement membrane. Most people with allergic or nonallergic asthma, including thosewith mild asthma, have eosinophils in their bronchi, andthere is a significant although variable association betweenthe activation of eosinophils and the severity of asthma 2 and airway hyperresponsiveness55. MECHANISMS OF ASTHMA 53 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEEosinophils possess a wide array of biological properties, including a capacity to release toxic granule proteins,oxygen free radicals, eicosanoids (sulfido-peptideleukotrienes) 56, platelet activating Th2 cytokines57,58, and a range of growth factors59-61. They can be activated for mediator secretion by both immune andnon-immune mechanisms 62. Activated eosinophils may initiate contraction of human airway smooth muscle63, increase microvascular permeability64, and induce airway hyperresponsiveness65. However, in a preliminary study an IL-5-blocking monoclonal antibody administered for upto 16 weeks reduced blood and sputum eosinophils toalmost undetectable levels, but had no effect on theallergen-induced early- and late-phase responses, nor on airway hyperresponsiveness 66. These findings may call into question the role of the eosinophil as aproinflammatory cell in all cases of asthma, especiallybecause similar reductions in the eosinophil count areproduced by exogenous IL-12 or IFN- /H9253without any evidence of physiological or clinical benefit 67. Further studies are needed to determine whether these findingscan be extrapolated to eosinophil functions in chronicasthma. Mast cells. Mast cells are found in the bronchi of normal subjects and people with asthma 55,68-70. They are often in a degranulated state in the airways of people with asthma, both in the stable phase of the disease and -to a greater extent- following allergen challenge71,72. In addition to releasing autacoid mediators, airway mast cells are animportant source of neutral proteases, especially tryptase,which has a range of effects on protein substratesincluding protease-activated receptors. Neutrophils. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils have long been regarded as terminal differentiated cells, incapable of protein synthesis and fulfilling only a passive effector rolein inflammation via phagocytosis and the release ofpreformed enzymes and cytotoxic compounds. However,neutrophils can release a of enzymesincluding MMP-9 in the airways of patients withchronic and severe asthma during respiratory virusexacerbations or after exposure to air pollutants, but theirrole in the pathophysiologic changes of severe asthmarequires elucidation 76. Macrophages. Tissue macrophages have the potential to secrete a wide variety of products, many of which play amajor role in the processes of injury and repair 77-79. They synthesize and secrete plasminogen activator and a group of metallopreoteinases that can degrade variousextracellular matrix macromolecules including elastin 80. Macrophages may also be involved in airway remodelingthrough the secretion of growth factors such as platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growthfactor (b-FGF), and TGF-/H9252 81. Neural Control of Airways Several irritant stimuli (such as fog, sulfur dioxide, dust, and cold air) provoke reflex bronchoconstriction bystimulating the sensory receptors in the airways. In both normal subjects and subjects with asthma, thisphysiologic defense mechanism is able to provokebronchoconstriction. However, the bronchoconstrictorresponse in subjects with asthma develops at a lower levelof stimulation and is more intense compared to that innormal subjects. It has been proposed that increasedactivity of the parasympathetic autonomic nervous systemis responsible for some of the airway hyperresponsivenesspresent in asthma 82. While this mechanism may be involved, it does not seem to be a major cause of airflowlimitation in this disease 83. The system of innervation of the airways is much more complex. In addition to theclassic cholinergic hasbeen described in human airways 83. The demonstration of an extensive network of nerve fibers containing potentneuropeptides and neuroregulators (EGF-like growthfactors), in addition to classic neurotransmitters, hasrevived interest in the possible role of abnormalities of theneural control of airways in the pathogenesis of asthma 83. Nitric oxide (NO) is a reactive gas formed from arginine in both neuronal and nonneuronal tissue through theaction of nitric oxide synthase. In asthma, there is some evidence to suggest that the inducible(glucocortiocosteroid-suppressible) form of this enzyme is upregulated in the epithelium 84. NO is a potent vasodilator and a bronchodilator and most likely serves as a neuroregulator released from non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic inhibitory nerves 85, which regulate airway smooth muscle tone, pulmonary blood flow, and localimmune responses. Thus, an abnormality of NOproduction and/or breakdown may be relevant to asthmapathophysiology 86. The observation that mast cells and eosinophils have the propensity to aggregate in airway nerve ganglia and that their mediators are able to interfere withneurotransmission creates further sites at whichneuroeffector mechanisms may contribute to the asthmaphenotype. The availability of potent and selectiveinhibitors and antagonists of these inflammatory cellmediators should help resolve some of these issues. 54 MECHANISMS OF ASTHMA COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEAIRWAY REMODELING Airway remodeling is a heterogeneous process leading to changes in connective tissue deposition and to altered airways structure through a dynamic process of dedifferentiation, migration, differentiation, and maturationof structural cells 3(Figure 4-2). Several structural features are characteristically involved in airway remodeling in asthma. In the bronchi the subepithelial basement membrane is of normal thickness, but thickening and an increase in thedensity of the lamina reticularis typically occur early in the disease process. This thickening is brought about by aplexiform deposition of interstitial collagens I, III, and V andfibronectin 87produced by activated myofibroblasts, which themselves derive from the attenuated fibroblast sheathlying immediately beneath the epithelium 45. The observation that increased collagen deposition in the lamina reticularis occurs only in asthma suggests that this change is afundamental abnormality linked to pathogenesis of thedisease. The combination of epithelial damage, prolonged epithelial repair, overproduction of profibrotic growth factors (e.g.,TGF-/H9252 ), and proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is thought to be central to theremodeling process. Activated myofibroblasts produce arange of growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines thatpromote proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells and increases in microvascular permeability and neuralnetworks. Since these changes have been observed inchildren before the onset of asthma, it has been suggestedthat activation or reactivation of the epithelialmesenchymal trophic unit, in addition to inflammation, isfundamental to asthma and differentiates the humandisease from the relatively acute allergen-inducedinflammation observed in many animal \"models\" of the disease. Increased deposition of matrix molecules,including complex proteoglycans, deeper in the airway wallhas been observed in patients who have died of asthma,and its extent is directly related to disease duration. The ECM is a dynamic structure, characterized under normal circumstances by an equilibrium betweensynthesis and controlled degradation of ECM components.Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) degradeECM components (MMP-2 and MMP-9) are of specialsignificance in this process, as their respectiveinhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP)-1 andTIMP-2. MMPs have also been implicated in angiogenesisand smooth muscle hyperplasia through their release ofactive forms of growth factors, and they also play a crucialrole in the trafficking of inflammatory and structural cells.Components of the ECM also interact with inflammatorycells 88(Figure 4-2). Proteoglycans can serve as a reservoir for cytokines and growth factors89,90, as \" traps\" for water causing persistent tissue swelling, as ligands for celladhesion molecules on inflammatory cells 91,92, and as promoters of leukocyte mediator release and cell survival 93-95. Cytokines and growth factors cause the proliferation of airway smooth muscle and induce thesynthesis of ECM proteins 48,96. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway muscle,goblet cells, and submucosal glands 97,98occur in the bronchi of people with asthma, especially in those withchronic and severe disease. Overall, the airways inasthma display various structural alterations that can allcontribute to an overall increase in airway wall thickness.For decades, asthma has been considered a condition ofreversible airflow obstruction. In the majority of patients,complete reversiblity of longstanding abnormalities inspirometric measurements such as FEV1may be observed after treatment with inhaled glucocorticosteroids.However, many people with asthma have evidence ofresidual airway obstruction after such treatment, which caneven exist in asymptomatic patients, and this likelyrepresents remodeling. Remodeling may also beimportant in the pathogenesis of nonspecific airwayhyperresponsiveness, especially the component thatreverses slowly (over 1 to 2 years) or incompletely withinhaled glucocorticosteroid treatment 99,100. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ASTHMA Airways Obstruction Inflammatory changes in the airways of people with asthma are thought to underlie the disorder's definingpattern of disturbances in function: airways obstructioncausing airflow limitation that varies spontaneously or as aresult of treatment. These functional changes areassociated with the characteristic symptoms of asthma - cough, chest tightness, and wheezing -and with airway hyperresponsiveness to bronchoconstrictor stimuli. Coughis probably caused by stimulation of sensory nerves in theairways by inflammatory mediators, and recurrent coughmay be the only symptom of asthma, especially in children(\"cough variant asthma\" ) 101-103. Inflammatory mediators may also affect the perception of breathlessness throughtheir effects on afferent nerves. At one extreme, afferentnerve stimulation may contribute, sometimes withhypercapnia or hypoxemia, to the disproportionately greatdrive to breathing that accounts for the alveolar hyperventi-lation and possibly also for some of the distress of acuteasthma attacks. At the other extreme, changes in afferent MECHANISMS OF ASTHMA 55 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEreceptor function are thought to be responsible for a reduced ability to sense bronchial narrowing in somepatients, especially those with chronic severe asthma, theso-called \"poor perceivers\" 104-107. The airway narrowing of asthma is multifactorial. The major cause is contraction of bronchial smooth muscleprovoked by agonists released efferent consequences ofairway smooth muscle contraction are exaggerated bythickening of the airway wall due to acute edema, cellularinfiltration, and remodeling -the chronic hyperplasia of smooth muscle, vascular, and secretory cells anddeposition of matrix in the airway wall 108. Still greater airflow limitation may arise if the lumen of the airwaysbecomes filled with copious, thick, viscous secretionsproduced by goblet cells and submucosal glands, leakageof plasma proteins from the bronchial microvasculature,and cellular debris 108-113. Virtually all of the functional disturbances of asthma derive from this airway narrowing, which affects all parts of thetracheobronchial tree but is probably maximal in smallbronchi 2 to 5 mm in diameter 114-116. Airway resistance is in- creased, and maximal expiratory flow is reduced at all lungvolumes. Narrowed peripheral airways close at higherlung volumes, causing marked increases in residualvolume 117. Also contributing to thoracic hyperinflation is the tendency to breathe at a higher lung volume, as anadaptive mechanism to reduce excessive airwaynarrowing by increasing circumferential traction onintrapulmonary airways 118. These changes greatly increase the work of breathing: resistive work is increasedbecause of the high pressures required to move airthrough narrowed airways, and elastic work is increasedbecause of the lower compliance of both the lungs and thethoracic cage at high volumes. Overinflation of the thoraxplaces the diaphragm and intercostal muscles at amechanical disadvantage, so that they must function overa suboptimal range of their length-tension curve 119. The increase in the work of breathing and the loss in muscle ef-ficiency cause fatigue and can lead to exhaustion andrespiratory failure. Airway HyperresponsivenessAsthma is almost invariably associated with airways that narrow too easily and/or too much in response toprovocative stimuli 120,121. The potential for excessive airway narrowing is clinically the most relevant physiologicalabnormality in this disease. The mechanisms responsiblefor this exaggerated reactivity or \"hyperresponsiveness\" are not known, but may be related to altered behavior ofairway smooth muscle secondary to changes in itscontractility or phenotype 122. In addition, inflammatory changes in the airway wall, particularly in the peribronchialregion, could strongly enhance airway narrowing duringsmooth muscle contraction 123(Figure 4-3). Airway hyperresponsiveness is most often assessedclinically by delivering progressively increasing doses of anaerosol of a pharmacologic stimulant -such as histamine or methacholine- until a measure of lung function changes by a predetermined amount 120,121(Figure 1-5). The most commonly used endpoint is a fall in FEV1, and airway hyperresponsiveness is expressed in terms of the\"provocative concentration \" or \"provocative dose\" causing a 20 percent fall, the \" PC20\" or \"PD20\". A PC20of < 8 mg/ml for confirmsairway hyperresponsiveness and is characteristic ofasthma 120,121, but may be found in other disorders such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, and allergic rhinitis. In asthma,there is a rough inverse correlation between the PC20or PD20and the severity of the disease 120,121. Airway hyperresponsiveness can also be demonstrated by anincrease or even absence of a maximal response plateauon the dose-response curve 120. Other provocative stimuli such as exercise; eucapnic hyperpnea of cold, dry air; andaerosols of hypertonic saline, distilled water, andadenosine have no direct action on airway smooth muscle(unlike histamine and methacholine). Instead, they arepresumed to stimulate release of mediators from mastcells, nerve endings, or other cells resident in theairways 120,121(Figure 1-2), and thus have an advantage in that they act through a mechanism more closely 56 MECHANISMS OF ASTHMAFigure 4-3. Mechanisms of Airway Hyperresponsiveness COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEresembling that of the triggers of bronchoconstriction encountered in day-to-day life. Comparison of airwayresponsiveness to histamine, a direct smooth muscleagonist, and to adenosine, which acts through theactivation of airway mast cells, has been used to inferwhether changes in measurements of responsiveness aredue primarily to a change in the release of mediators fromairway mast cells or to a change in the airway 's responsiveness to them. Airway Smooth MuscleSome measurements of isotonic contraction of airway smooth muscle in subjects with asthma have shownincreased shortening 124,125. This change in contractile function could result from alterations in the contractile apparatus 126, in smooth muscle tissue elasticity, or in the extracellular matrix127. The enhanced contractility seen in asthma seems to be associated with increased velocity ofshortening 127. This may be accompanied by smooth muscle growth128and/or changes in smooth muscle cell phenotype, with cells varying between contractile, secretory, andproliferative phenotypes in interaction with airwaysinflammation 129. In addition, there is evidence that changes in the organization of contractile filaments or in the plasticityof smooth muscle cells can underlie the maintenance ofchronic airway hyperresponsiveness 130. This illustrates that the functional properties of airway smooth muscle arefundamental to the properties of airways in vivo. The role of airway dynamics is further underlined by the\"perturbed equilibrium \" hypothesis, suggesting that airway smooth muscle in asthma becomes stiffened when it is notperiodically stretched, leading to a latch-state causingpersistent airway narrowing 131. Such a \"frozen,\" contractile state might occur secondarily to airway inflammation, whichleads to adventitial swelling and thereby to mechanicaluncoupling of elastic recoil pressure and airway smoothmuscle 123,131. Inflammatory mediators released from the mast cell -such as tryptase and eosinophil cationic protein -have been shown to increase the contractile response of smooth muscle to other inflammatory mediators such as histamine132. These findings provide a link between a mast-cell-derivedproduct and in vitro human airway hyperresponsiveness. The inflammatory milieu may affect smooth musclecontractility directly 133, and will also have secondary effects through changes in airway geometry and mechanics123,134. Mucus Hypersecretion Chronic excessive production of sputum is the defining symptom of chronic bronchitis, but is also characteristic ofpatients with asthma who have never smoked cigarettes orworked in a dusty occupation. Surveys have shown thatas many as 30 percent of people with asthma reportsputum production on a daily basis and 70 percent report itas an important symptom during attacks 135. In fact, asthma is often misdiagnosed as \"recurrent acute bronchitis. \" Goblet cell and submucosal gland cell areconsistently found in the airways of people withasthma 131,132, and are features of the airway wall remodeling characteristic of chronic asthma. Widespreadobstruction of the airways by mucus plugs is almostinvariably found in fatal asthma 111-113,136,137and is likely an important cause of the airflow obstruction that oftenpersists despite maximal bronchodilator treatment ofsevere attacks. Airway secretions in subjects with asthma are not simply increased in volume compared to normal subjects; theydiffer in viscoelastic and rheologic properties as well.These quantitative and qualitative differences are thoughtto arise from both the infiltration of the airway wall byinflammatory cells and the pathologic changes in secretorycells and blood vessels in the airway epithelium andsubmucosa. The abnormal thickness and \"stickiness \" of these secretions are due not simply to an excess of mucinproduction 138, but also to clumps of sloughed epithelial cells, albumin leaked from the bronchial microvasculature,eosinophil-derived basic proteins, and DNA from lysedinflammatory cells 138,139. These changes account for the occasional finding of bronchial casts of inspissated mucus (Curschmann' s spirals) in sputum from patients with asthma 140. The hypersecretion of mucus in asthma reflects two distinct types of pathophysologic mechanisms: those responsiblefor secretory hyperplasia in the inflammatory cascade characteristic ofasthma and include epidermal and other growth factors 141, IL-4, IL-9, and IL-1314,142,143. Goblet cell degranulation is triggered by environmental stimuli (such as smoke, sulfurdioxide, chlorine, and ammonia), possibly through the localrelease of neuropeptides or the activation of cholinergicreflex pathways. Possibly more important is thedegranulation provoked by elastase in sputum produced during acute exacerbations ofasthma suggests that this may be an especially importantsecretagogue in severe attacks 146,147. MECHANISMS OF ASTHMA 57 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEIrreversible Airflow Limitation The thickening of the airway wall characteristic of remodeling takes place in both cartilaginous (large)airways and membranous (small) airways and is evident inboth pathologic and radiographic studies 115,116,148. Together with changes in the elastic properties of the airways andloss of the interdependence between the airways and thesurrounding parenchyma, airway wall thickening mayexplain the occurrence of persistent and incompletelyreversible airway narrowing in a subgroup of patients withasthma 149-151. The mechanisms responsible for remodeling are the focus of active research but are not yet defined99. They are presumed to be linked to chronic or recurrentairway inflammation, and there is some evidence that lossof airway function, again presumed to reflect remodeling,occurs even in mild asthma of recent onset but can beprevented by early introduction of regular therapy with aninhaled glucocorticosteroid 152-154. Furthermore, smooth muscle stiffening also contributes to the development ofirreversible airflow limitation in asthma 131. The proportion of patients with mild asthma who are at risk for developingclinically important, chronic, irreversible airflow limitation isnot known. ExacerbationsEpisodic worsening is a major feature of asthma 155. There are multiple triggers for exacerbations, including stimuli that produce bronchoconstriction only ( \"inciters \"), such as cold air, fog, or exercise, and stimuli that promote airwaysinflammation (\" inducers\" ), such as exposure to allergens, occupational sensitizers, ozone, or respiratory virusinfection 120,156. Exercise and hyperventilation with cold and dry air157cause bronchoconstriction in asthma by cooling and drying of the airways, leading to the release fromairway resident cells and inflammatory cells of mediatorssuch as histamine or cysteinyl leukotrienes, whichstimulate smooth muscle contraction 158. These \" inciters\" do not worsen bronchial responsiveness to other stimuli,and so have only transient effects. Asthma exacerbations may develop over a number of days. Most are associated with respiratory virusinfections, particularly the common cold virus(rhinovirus) 159. Rhinovirus can induce an inflammatory response in the intrapulmonary airways160, and in patients with asthma this inflammation is associated with anepisode of variable airways obstruction and worsenedbronchial hyperresponsiveness 161. The inflammatory response involves eosinophil and/or neutrophil influx andactivation, which may be mediated by cytokines orchemokines released by T cells and/or bronchial epithelialcells 162,163. It is highly likely that allergen exposure can also induceexacerbations in sensitized subjects with asthma 164. In par- ticular, patients with late asthmatic responses demonstratea flare-up of eosinophilic airways inflammation after allergenchallenge, which is followed by an episode of aggravatedairway hyperresponsiveness 56. Repeated allergen challenge at a sub-bronchoconstrictor level, which probably bettermimicks natural, seasonal exposures 57, can also induce such responses. The possibility cannot be excluded thatsuch repeated, sub-bronchoconstrictor exposures canactually induce persistent airways inflammation and someaspects of airway remodeling, such as collagen depositionin the subepithelial reticular layer 165. Persistent abnormalities occur after exposure tooccupational sensitzers in patients with occupationalasthma 166. Even several months after cessation of exposure, airway hyperresponsiveness and some aspectsof airways inflammation (mucosal eosinophils andmacrophages) can persist, while other features (includingsubepithelial collagen deposition) usually show somereversal 167. Such findings illustrate that there is a complex interaction between the pathophysiological mechanismsinvolved in exacerbations and those involved in thepersistence of asthma. This interaction is furthercomplicated by potential interactions between different\"inducers,\" for example, between occupational sensitizers and air pollutants 168. In about 10 percent of adult patients with asthma,nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibitcyclooxygenase-1 precipitate asthma attacks 169. These attacks may be dangerous. In a large retrospective surveyof adult asthma patients who underwent mechanicalventilation for a near-fatal attack of asthma, 24 percenthad a history of intolerance to aspirin 170. Nocturnal Asthma Nocturnal worsening of asthma is a well recognized clinical characteristic in a considerable number of patients171. Bronchial biopsy specimens do not demonstrate increasesin T cell, eosinophil, or mast cell numbers at 4:00 a.m. inpeople who have asthma with nocturnal airwaysobstruction 172. However, transbronchial biopsies have provided some evidence of nighttime accumulation ofeosinophils and macrophages in alveolar andperibronchial tissue in patients with nocturnal asthma 40. The latter findings are of special interest, given theproposed role of adventitial inflammation in the peripheralairways in the development of excessive airwaynarrowing 123,134. Altered airway-parenchymal interdependence may be extremely important in nocturnalasthma, a hypothesis also supported by recent 58 MECHANISMS OF ASTHMA COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEobservations showing loss of such interdependence in people with asthma during sleep in a supine position asopposed to awake in a supine position 173. Blood Gas Abnormalities Asthma causes important impairments of gas exchange only during severe attacks. The degree of arterialhypoxemia roughly correlates with the severity of airwaysobstruction that is not homogeneous throughout the lungs.Often, some airways are completely occluded, othersseverely narrowed, and still others unobstructed. Theresulting mismatch of ventilation and perfusion widens thealveolar-arterial oxygen difference ((A-a)dO2), accounting for the oxygen tensions of 60-69 mm Hg (8.0-9.2 kPa)typically found during severe attacks of asthma 174. The hypocapnia that is almost invariably found in mild tomoderate attacks reflects an increase in respiratory drive.An elevated arterial PCO2indicates that airways obstruction is so severe that the muscles of respirationcannot maintain the ventilation rate set by the respiratorydrive (alveolar hypoventilation). Any worsening of airwaysobstruction or muscle fatigue, or any decline in respiratorydrive (as from administration of a narcotic or sedativedrug), can then cause a further fall in alveolar ventilation.The rise in arterial PCO2then further inhibits muscle performance and respiratory drive (\" CO2narcosis\" ), precipitating respiratory failure and death 175,176. Arterial hypercapnia thus indicates an attack of extreme severitythat requires aggressive management. REFERENCES 1. Vignola AM, Chanez P, Campbell AM, Souques F, Lebel B, Enander I, et al.

Part of the problem is that many patients tolerateintermittent respiratory symptoms (though not, forexample, chest pains) before obtaining a medical opinion.The transient nature of asthma symptoms serves toreinforce the acceptance of symptoms. Another importantfactor resulting in underdiagnosis of asthma is thenonspecific nature of the symptoms, which can lead toalternative diagnoses by the attending health careprofessional. It should be remembered that establishing acorrect diagnosis of asthma is essential if appropriate drugtherapy is to be given. Not infrequently asthma in childrenis diagnosed as variant forms of bronchitis 2and, as a consequence, treated inappropriately and ineffectively withsuccessive courses of antibiotics and cough medications 3. Although the adage \" all that wheezes is not asthma \" is frequently cited, asthma as a cause of wheeze and relatedsymptoms is so common that a more appropriate viewmight be \" all that wheezes is asthma until proven otherwise.\"CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS History and Measurements of Symptoms A clinical diagnosis of asthma is often prompted by symptoms such as episodic breathlessness, wheezing,and chest tightness. Seasonal variability of symptoms anda positive family history of asthma and atopic disease arealso helpful diagnostic guides. Figure 5-1 highlights questions that are useful when considering a diagnosis of asthma. Figure 5-2 presents a questionnaire that has been used and validated for the diagnosis of asthma in epidemiological studies 4,5. Measurements of symptoms and lung function areimportant parameters for assessing the characteristics of the patient's asthma. Various symptom scores havebeen developed and validated in order to quantify asthmacontrol 6and quality of life7,8. Symptom scores should be adapted to the age and the cultural background of thepatient. Physical ExaminationBecause asthma symptoms are variable, the physical examination of the respiratory system may be normal. Themost usual abnormal physical finding is wheezing onauscultation. However, some people with asthma may Figure 5-1. Questions to Consider in Diagnosis of Asthma Has the patient had an attack or recurrent attacks of wheezing? Does the patient have a troublesome cough at night? Does the patient have a wheeze or cough after exercise? Does the patient have wheeze, chest tightness, or cough after exposure to airborne allergens or pollutants? Do the patient' s colds \" go to the chest\" or take more than 10 days to clear up? Are symptoms improved by appropriate antiasthma treatment?KEY POINTS: Asthma is underdiagnosed throughout the world. Asthma can often be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. However, measurements of lung function, and particularly the reversibility of lungfunction abnormalities, greatly enhance diagnosticconfidence. Lung function measurements that are most helpful for the diagnosis of asthma (in patients over 5 yearsof age) include forced expiratory volume in 1 second(FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and airway hyperresponsiveness. Asthma severity is classified by the presence of clinical features before treatment is started and/or bythe amount of daily medication required for optimaltreatment. Measurements of allergic status add little to the diagnosis of asthma but can help in the identificationof risk factors so that appropriate environmentalcontrol measures can be recommended. Special care should be given to diagnosing asthma in children, in individuals with recurrent cough, in theelderly, and in individuals exposed to occupationalagents known to cause asthma. Figure 5-2. International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD ) Asthma Questionnaire4,5 Have you had wheezing or whistling in your chest at any time? Have you had an attack of shortness of breath that came on following strenuous activity at any time? Have you woken up with an attack of wheezing at any time? Have you woken up with an attack of coughing at any time? Have you had an attack of shortness of breath that came on during the day when you were at rest at any time? 68 DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEhave normal auscultation but significant airflow limitation when measured objectively. Clinical signs such as dyspnea, airflow limitation (wheeze), and hyperinflation are more likely to be present if patientsare examined during symptomatic periods. During anexacerbation of asthma, contraction of airway smoothmuscle, edema, and hypersecretion tend to close thesmaller (noncartilaginous) airways. To compensate, thepatient breathes at a higher lung volume to increaseoutward retraction of the airways, thereby helping tomaintain their patency. Thus the more severe the airflowlimitation, the greater the tendency for airway closure tooccur, and the higher the lung volume must be to keepairways open. The combination of hyperinflation andadvanced airflow limitation in an asthma exacerbation alsomarkedly increases the work of breathing. Although wheezing is the most typical physical finding in asthma, this sign may be absent in severe asthmaexacerbations. However, patients in this state usuallyhave other physical signs reflecting severity, such ascyanosis, drowsiness, difficulty speaking, tachycardia,hyperinflated chest, use of accessory muscles, andintercostal recession. Measurements of Lung FunctionPatients with asthma frequently have poor recognition of their symptoms and poor perception of the severity,especially if their asthma is severe and longstanding 9. Assessment of symptoms such as dyspnea and wheezingby physicians may also be inaccurate. Measurements of lung function, particularly the reversibility of lungfunction abnormalities, provide a direct assessment ofairflow limitation. Measuring the variability in lung function provides an indirect assessment of airwayhyperresponsiveness. However, although somerelationship has been established between laboratoryindices of airway hyperresponsiveness and peakexpiratory flow (PEF) variability 10, they are not interchangeable. For example, PEF variability mayrespond rapidly to glucocorticosteroid treatment 11, whereas histamine or methacholine airway responsivenessimproves over a slower time course 12. Nevertheless, measurements of airflow limitation, its reversibility ( Figure 1-5 andFigure 1-7), and its variability ( Figure 1-6) are considered critical in establishing a clear diagnosis ofasthma. These measurements underlie the new asthmamanagement strategies advocated in established asthmaguidelines. Measurement of lung function for diagnosingand monitoring asthma is analogous to measurement inother chronic diseases. For example, blood pressuremeasured with a sphygmomanometer is used fordiagnosing and monitoring hypertension, and bloodglucose measured with reagent strips or digital read-outmeters is used for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes. A wide range of different methods to assess the level of airflow limitation exists, but two methods have foundwidespread acceptance for use in patients over 5 years ofage. These are the measurement of forced expiratoryvolume in 1 second (FEV1) and its accompanying forced vital capacity (FVC), and the measurement of peakexpiratory flow (PEF). Both of these measurementsdepend on the concept of airflow limitation relating directlyto the luminal size of the airways (airway caliber) and theelastic properties of the surrounding lung tissue (alveoli). Spirometry. Measurement of FEV1and FVC is undertaken during a forced expiratory maneuver using a spirometer. Recommendations for the standardization ofspirometry have been published 13,14. The procedure is repeatable, but effort dependent; therefore, properinstructions on how to perform the forced expiratorymaneuver must be given to patients, and the highestvalues of two or three recordings taken. The test begins tolose its reliability at values of FEV1less than 1 liter. Predicted values of FEV1, FVC, and PEF based on age, gender, and height have been obtained from populationstudies, and although these are being continually revised,they form some useful bases against which to judgewhether a given value is abnormal or not. It is importantthat predicted values of FEV1, FVC, and PEF take into account ethnic characteristics and extremes of age.Because diseases other than those causing airflowlimitation may result in reduced FEV1, a useful assessment of airflow limitation can be obtained as theratio of FEV1to FVC. In the normal lung, flow limitation on forced expiration results in FEV1/FVC ratios of greater than 80 percent and in children possibly greater than 90percent. Any values less than these are suggestive ofairflow limitation. Spirometry is helpful for the diagnosis of asthma, where at least a 12 percent improvement in FEV1either spontaneously, after inhalation of a bronchodilator, or inresponse to a trial of glucocorticosteroid therapy favors adiagnosis of asthma 15. Spirometry is also helpful for monitoring the activity of the asthma, although primarily ina clinic health care setting because the apparatus iscumbersome and moderately expensive. Small electronicspirometers have been developed for portable use, butexpense is likely to limit their widespread acceptance.Nevertheless, spirometry recordings are helpful indiagnosing asthma and assessing its severity, and DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION 69 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE70DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATIONrecordings at regular intervals (dependent upon the severity of the disease) assist in monitoring the long-termprogress of asthma and its long-term response totherapeutic interventions. Spirometry, as opposed to PEFmonitoring, is particularly helpful in assessing progress inpatients with greatly compromised lung function (e.g., theelderly person with asthma and chronic obstructivepulmonary disease) because PEF measurements can berelatively well preserved in such patients in the presenceof greatly reduced spirometric values. Peak expiratory flow. An important aid in the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of asthma is the PEF meter. In some countries, PEF meters are becoming available onhealth service prescription. Recent versions of the PEFmeter are relatively inexpensive (at least in affluentcountries), portable, plastic, and ideal for patients to use inhome settings for day-to-day objective monitoring ofasthma. PEF meters are useful in clinic and primary health care settings to help in the diagnosis of asthma, where at leasta 15 percent improvement after inhalation of abronchodilator or in response to a trial ofglucocorticosteroid therapy favors a diagnosis of asthma 16. PEF meters are also useful for ongoing supervision ofasthma if spirometry is impractical ( Figure 1-6). Finally, regular home monitoring of PEF is sometimes usefulbecause it can help patients detect early signs of asthmadeterioration. Several studies have demonstrated thatpatients' symptom reports are unreliable indicators of airflow limitation 17,18. Poor perception of the severity of asthma on the part of the patient and health careprofessional has been cited as a major factor causingdelay in treatment and thus may contribute to increasedseverity and mortality from asthma exacerbations 19. However, this is not the case with all patients. One studyshowed that symptoms preceded the onset of declines inlung function 20. It is important to note that measurements of PEF do notalways correlate with other measurements of lung functionin asthma and are not necessarily interchangeable inevaluating asthma severity 21. For example, in children with asthma, PEF can be normal as airflow obstruction and gastrapping worsens. Therefore PEF can underestimate thedegree of airflow obstruction 22. Also, in children, measurements of PEF do not always correlate withsymptoms or other measures of disease severity 23. For these reasons, PEF measurements are ideally comparedto the patient 's own previous best measurements. Careful instruction is required if patients are to reliablymeasure PEF because PEF measurements, like FEV1 and FVC measurements, are effort dependent. A PEFmeter may be used regularly throughout the day and overweeks and months to aid in the assessment of asthmaseverity and monitor the response to treatment. Theseverity of asthma is reflected not only in the level ofbaseline airflow limitation, but also in its variability,particularly across 24 hours ( Figure 1-6). Ideally PEF should be measured first thing in the morning when valuesare usually close to their lowest and last thing at nightwhen values are usually at their highest. One method of describing diurnal PEF variability is as the amplitude (the difference between the prebronchodilatormorning value and the postbronchodilator value from theevening before), expressed as a percentage of the meandaily PEF value 24. Another method is the minimum morning prebronchodilator PEF over 1 week, expressedas a percent of the recent best (Min%Max) 25(Figure 5-3). This latter method has been suggested to be the best PEFindex of airway lability because it requires only a once-daily reading, it correlates better than any other index withairway hyperresponsiveness, and the calculation is simple 25. A diurnal variation in PEF of more than 20 percent isconsidered to be diagnostic of asthma, the magnitude ofthe variability being broadly proportional to disease severity(Figure 1-6) 24. However, it should be noted that in mild intermittent asthma or in severe intractable disease,variability in PEF may not be present or may be lost. In more severe asthma, diurnal variation and reversibilitymay not be a feature until after a trial of glucocorticosteroids.Even then, the more severe intransigent forms of the disorder may take many weeks of treatment beforereversibility becomes apparent. By using a combination of regular symptom recording and PEF measurement, patients can be provided recent best)= 85%)Figure A Simple Index of PEF Variation25 (Minimum morning PEF (% recent best) = 570/670 = 85%) COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEtreatment plans that are responsive to asthma severity, and the course of asthma can be effectively monitored26. Furthermore, it is conceivable that a patient's adherence totreatment may be enhanced by observing objectivelyhis/her responses to therapy. Although long-term PEF monitoring for most patients with persistent asthma can be valuable and may be anideal, this is not always be possible for reasons of cost,cooperation, and availability of peak flow meters.However, short-term monitoring is particularlyrecommended for establishing a diagnosis, identifying possible environmental triggers, and evaluating changes in therapy. Long-term monitoring is particularlyrecommended for those patients with severe asthma, forthose with poor perception of severity, and for those whohave ever been hospitalized. PEF measurement may be of use not only in establishing a diagnosis of asthma and assessing its severity but alsoin uncovering an occupational cause for asthma. Whenused in this way, PEF should be measured morefrequently than twice daily and special attention paid tochanges occurring inside and outside the workplace 27. If, in the presence of infrequent symptoms, these tests fail to support a diagnosis of asthma, it is usually advisableto maintain surveillance with periodic reevaluation until the diagnostic situation becomes clearer. In thesecircumstances, the health care professional should takespecial consideration of the patient's family history, age,and asthma triggers before deciding on a diagnostic ortherapeutic course of action. When there is doubt, a trialof treatment with short-acting /H92522-agonists as needed and inhaled glucocorticosteroids is considered one of thesurest ways of establishing a diagnosis of asthma,especially if combined with PEF monitoring. A clearknowledge of the degree of lung dysfunction (such as withdaily measurements of PEF) over a period of time not onlyoffers the opportunity for detecting environmentally relatedcauses of the asthma but also provides the criteria forassessing asthma severity and environmental influences,and for observing the response to treatment. The clinician must always feel confident that the diagnosis of asthma is fully established because the consequencesfor the patient are considerable and frequently lifelong.The requirements for diagnostic confirmation in patientspresenting with severe symptoms and gross lungdysfunction differ from those for asymptomatic patients. Airway hyperresponsiveness. For patients with symptoms consistent with asthma, but normal lung function, measurements of airway responsiveness tomethacholine, histamine, or exercise challenge may helpestablish a diagnosis of asthma 28. These measurements are sensitive for a diagnosis of asthma, but have lowspecificity 29. This means that a negative test can be useful to exclude a diagnosis of persistent asthma, but a positivetest does not always mean that a patient has asthma. This is because airway hyperresponsiveness has beendescribed in patients with allergic rhinitis 30and in those with airflow limitation caused by conditions other thanasthma, such as cystic fibrosis 31, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease32. Measuring Noninvasive Markers of Airway Inflammation The evaluation of airway inflammation associated with asthma may be undertaken by examining spontaneouslyproduced or hypertonic saline-induced sputum foreosinophils and metachromatic cells 33. In addition, levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO)34or carbon monoxide (CO)35 have been suggested as noninvasive markers of airway inflammation in asthma. Levels of exhaled NO and COare elevated in people with asthma (who are not takinginhaled glucocorticosteroids) compared to people withoutasthma, yet these findings are not specific for asthma.Neither sputum eosinophilia nor exhaled gases has yetbeen evaluated prospectively as an aid in asthmadiagnosis. There is a need to develop further noninvasivediscriminate measurements of airway inflammation. Measurements of Allergic StatusThe presence of an allergic component in asthma can be identified by skin testing or measurement of specific IgE inserum. While these tests add little to the diagnosis ofasthma, they can help in identifying its risk factors ortriggers so that appropriate environmental controlmeasures can be recommended. Deliberate provocationof the airways with a suspected allergen or sensitizingagent may also be helpful in establishing causality,especially in the occupational setting 27, but is not routinely recommended, because it is not often useful inestablishing a diagnosis and on the grounds of safety. Skin tests with allergens represent the primary diagnostic tool in determining atopic status. Prick tests are the most commonly used for diagnostic purposes. Theircharacteristics -simplicity, rapidity of performance, low cost, and high sensitivity -explain their key position. However, when improperly performed, skin tests can leadto falsely positive or negative results. Measurement ofspecific IgE in serum does not surpass skin tests and ismore expensive. The main limitation of methods to assessallergic status is that a positive test does not necessarily DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION 71 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEmean that the disease is allergic in nature, as some individuals have specific IgE antibodies without anysymptoms. The relevant exposure and its relation tosymptoms must be confirmed by the patient history.Measurement of total IgE in serum has no value as adiagnostic test for atopy. PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT DIAGNOSTIC GROUPS In this section emphasis is given to the difficult problems indiagnosing asthma in children, in the elderly, in relation tooccupational exposure to risk factors, in seasonal asthma,and in cough variant asthma. For these patient groupsmeasurements of airflow limitation and variability areextremely useful for establishing a diagnosis of asthma. Childhood Asthma Diagnosis of asthma in children can present a particularly difficult problem, largely because episodic wheezing andcough are among the most common symptomsencountered in childhood illnesses, particularly in childrenunder 3 years old 3. Although health care professionals are increasingly encouraged to make a positive diagnosis ofasthma whenever recurrent wheezing, breathlessness,and cough occur (particularly if these symptoms occur atnight and in the early morning), the disorder 's underlying process may be different in infants than in older childrenand adults 36. The use of the label \" asthma\" to describe such children has important clinical consequences. Itimplies a syndrome in which there is airway inflammationand for which there is a specific protocol of management. The younger the child, the greater the likelihood that an alternative diagnosis may explain recurrent wheeze.Alternative causes of recurrent wheezing in infancy include cystic fibrosis, recurrent milk inhalation, primaryciliary dyskinesia syndrome, primary immune heart disease, congenital malformation causing narrowing of the intrathoracic airways, and foreign body aspiration. Features such as a neonatal onset of symptoms, associated failure to thrive, vomiting-associated symptoms, and focal lung or cardiovascularsigns all suggest an alternative diagnosis and indicate theneed for further investigations, such as a sweat test toexclude cystic fibrosis, measurements of immune function,and reflux studies. Chest radiography is an importantdiagnostic test to exclude such alternative causes ofwheezing. Among those children in whom an alternative diagnosis has been excluded, there is the possibility that recurrentwheezing does not have a uniform underlying pathogenesis 3. Nonetheless, there are two general patterns of wheezingin infancy. Some infants who have recurrent episodes ofwheeze associated with acute viral respiratory infections,often with a first episode in association with respiratorysyncytial virus bronchiolitis, come from nonatopic familiesand have no evidence of atopy themselves 37,38. These infants usually outgrow their symptoms in the preschoolyears and have no evidence of subsequent asthma,though they may have minor defects of lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness. This syndrome mayhave more to do with airway geometry than airwayinflammation 39, and thus may differ mechanistically from the more established chronic inflammatory condition thatunderlies asthma in older children and adults. Other infants with asthma have an atopic background often associated with eczema and develop symptoms laterin infancy that persist through childhood and into adultlife 40. In these children, characteristic features of airway inflammation can be found even in infancy. However,there are no practical, clinical tests that can be done toestablish the presence of airway inflammation. Also, there are no clear markers to predict the prognosis for anindividual child. However, in young children with frequentwheezing, a parental history of asthma along with thepresence of other atopic manifestations in the child aresignificantly associated with the presence of asthma at age 6 41. The onset of wheeze at an early age (under 2 years) is a poor predictor of whether asthma will persist in later childhood 3,37,38. It is likely that the relationship between wheezingassociated with recurrent viral infections and the laterdevelopment of persistent asthma requires further study.Not only are the etiological mechanisms of asthma in childhood unclear, but there is also considerablereluctance on the part of doctors to establish a diagnosisand, therefore, to initiate appropriate therapy. Becauselower respiratory tract symptoms similar to symptoms ofasthma are so common in childhood (and frequently occurin association with upper respiratory tract symptoms),often either a correct diagnosis is not made or aninappropriate diagnosis is given, thereby depriving thechild of antiasthma medication. Although in these youngchildren there is the possibility of overtreatment, theepisodes of wheezing may be foreshortened and reducedin intensity by the effective use of anti-inflammatorymedications and bronchodilators rather than antibiotics. It is for this reason that health care professionals areencouraged to use the word \" asthma\" rather than other terminology to describe recurrent viral-associatedwheezing in early childhood. 72DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEAsthma in all age groups may present only as repeated coughing, especially at night, with exercise, and with viralillness, but these are particularly common patterns ofpresentation of the disease in childhood. The presence ofrecurrent nocturnal cough in an otherwise healthy childshould raise asthma as a probable diagnosis. In children under the age of 5, the diagnosis of asthma has to be based largely on clinical judgment and anassessment of symptoms and physical findings. Becausethe measurement of airflow limitation and airway hyper-responsiveness in infants and small children requirescomplex equipment and is difficult 42, these measurements can only be recommended as a research tool. A trial oftreatment is probably the most confident way to make adiagnosis of asthma in children (and in many adults aswell). Prognostic features include a family history ofasthma or eczema and the presence of eczema in a youngchild with respiratory symptoms 38. Children 4 to 5 years old can be taught to use a PEF meter and obtain reliablereadings. However, unless there is careful parentalsupervision of when and how the measurements aremade, PEF recording in childhood can be unreliable 43. The use of diary cards to record symptoms, PEF, andtreatment has proved an invaluable part of asthmamanagement strategies. Some children with asthma present only with exercise- induced symptoms. In this group, or when there is doubtover the presence of mild asthma in a child, exercisetesting is helpful. A 6-minute running protocol is easilyperformed in clinical practice. When used in conjunctionwith measurements of airflow limitation (FEV1or PEF), this can be most helpful in establishing a firm diagnosis ofasthma 44, especially if the cough produced by the exercise is similar to that occurring spontaneously at night. Asthma in the ElderlyA group of patients in which the diagnosis of asthma is often not made or is missed is the elderly 45. Although lung damage from smoking or extensive exposure to inhaledenvironmental insults results in such diseases asbronchitis, emphysema, or fibrosing lung disease in thisage group, it is now becoming increasingly recognized that undiagnosed asthma is a frequent cause of treatablerespiratory symptoms. A further complicating factor is thedifficulty that some older people have in performing lungfunction tests, including PEF. This means that making adiagnosis of asthma or chronic bronchitis based purely onsymptoms is fraught with difficulties. Late-onset asthma occasionally occurs in association with vasculitis and marked eosinophilia (Churg-Strausssyndrome). In the older patient, longstanding asthma may enter a severe destructive phase associated withallergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Characteristically,however, late-onset asthma is not associated withevidence for specific allergen sensitization. Later in life, smoking and elevated serum IgE levels appear to be independent determinants of chronic airflowlimitation, although they may interact 46. This has led to a growing body of opinion that chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease (COPD), associated with a long history ofsmoking, may have an important inflammatory componentthat is responsive to anti-inflammatory drug intervention,thus blurring the boundary between asthma and otherforms of obstructive lung disease 47. When doubt exists, a trial of oral glucocorticosteroids in which a greater than 12percent improvement in FEV1or 15 percent improvement in PEF occurs, accompanied by improvement in symptomsand reduced bronchodilator requirement, usually confirmsasthma as a cause of chronic respiratory symptoms. The elderly are susceptible to episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, and cough caused by left ventricularfailure (sometimes mistakenly labeled cardiac asthma) 45. The presence of increased symptoms with exercise and atnight may add to the diagnostic confusion. A carefulhistory and physical examination looking for features ofischemic heart disease and cardiac dysfunction, togetherwith an ECG and chest x ray usually clarify the picture, butif after this doubt still persists, a trial of diuretic treatment is helpful. Not only is the diagnosis of asthma difficult in the elderly, but the assessment of severity also presents a particularproblem because the perception of symptoms and theirseverity is reduced in this age group when compared toyoung adults and also as a consequence of lifestyleadaptation. Occupational AsthmaAsthma acquired in the workplace is a diagnosis that is frequently missed unless the health care professional ismade aware of the possibility. Many inhalant chemicalsare now known to produce asthma in the occupationalenvironment (Figure 3-4). They range from highly reactivesmall molecular weight chemicals such as isocyanates, to known immunogens such as platinum salts, as well as to complex plant and animal biological products.Because of its insidious onset, occupational asthma isoften misdiagnosed as chronic bronchitis or some form ofCOPD and is therefore either not treated at all or treatedinappropriately. The diagnosis requires a definedoccupational history, especially in relation to exposure to DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION 73 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEsensitizing agents; absence of asthma symptoms before beginning employment; and a documented relationship between development of symptoms at the workplace andreduction of these on withdrawal from the workplace. Aconfirmation of occupational asthma may be successfullyachieved by lung function measurement, such as serialmeasurement of PEF at work and away from work (single measurements are less sensitive than serialmeasurements), and specific bronchial provocationtesting 48. The increasing recognition that occupational asthma can persist, or continue to deteriorate, even in theabsence of continued exposure to the offending agent 49, emphasizes the need for an early diagnosis, appropriatestrict avoidance of further exposure, and pharmacologicintervention. Seasonal AsthmaIn some sensitized individuals, asthma may be exacerbated by seasonal increases in specificaeroallergens. Examples include birch 50, grass51, Alternaria52, and ragweed pollens53. Seasonal asthma is usually associated with allergic rhinitis. This type of asthma may occur only intermittently, with the patientbeing entirely asymptomatic between seasons.Alternatively, it may occur as a seasonal worsening ofasthma symptoms in a patient with persistent asthma. Cough Variant AsthmaAnother group of patients whose asthma can sometimes be missed are those with cough variant asthma 54. These patients have chronic cough as their principal, if not only,symptom. Frequently this occurs at night; consequentlyevaluations during the day can be normal. For thesepatients, documentation of variability in lung function or ofairway hyperresponsiveness, and possibly a search forsputum eosinophils, are particularly important. Within thisgroup are patients who cough and have sputumeosinophils but who also have normal indices of lungfunction when assessed by spirometry and airway hyperresponsiveness 55. Some patients with hypertension treated by angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or patients withgastroesophageal reflux, postnasal drip, or chronicsinusitis, may develop a cough that resembles coughvariant asthma 56. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Asthma is one of the most common causes of respiratorysymptoms, but it is only one cause of lung disease ( Figure 5-4). An important step in ensuring diagnosis of asthma isthe demonstration of reversible and variable airflowlimitation, preferably by spirometry. Although in children both asthma and acute respiratory infections produce wheezing as a consequence ofwidespread airway obstruction, respiratory symptoms mayalso arise from localized airway obstruction and inhaledforeign bodies 57, possibilities that must always be considered in the differential diagnosis ( Figure 5-5). Another diagnosis to consider in both children and adultsis pseudoasthma, most often caused by vocal corddysfunction 58. In adults, asthma superimposed on COPD is a common problem in past or present smokers. CLASSIFICATION OF ASTHMA Asthma may be classified on the basis of etiology,severity, and pattern of airflow limitation.Figure 5-4. Overview of Lung Diseases LUNG DISEASES consist of INFECTIONS Simple colds, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS and related opportunistic infections and OBSTRUCTIVE DISEASES RESTRICTIVE DISORDERS Localized Lung disease Vocal cord paresis Extrinsic disease Generalized Pleural effusion AND CLASSIFICATION COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEEtiology Many attempts have been made to classify asthma according to etiology, particularly with regard to environmental sensitizing agents. Such a classification is,however, limited by the existence of patients in whom noenvironmental cause can be identified. Despite this, aneffort to identify a specific environmental cause for asthmain an individual patient should be part of the initial clinicalassessment, because it enables the use of avoidancestrategies in asthma management. SeverityConventional assessments of asthma severity have combined assessments of symptoms, amounts of /H92522-agonist used to treat symptoms, and lung function (Figure 5-6). An assessment of asthma based on clinical or symptom indices of disease severity over the precedingyear has been shown to relate to pathological indices ofairway inflammation 59. Both the level of airflow limitation and its variability enable asthma to be subdivided byseverity into four steps: Intermittent, Mild Persistent,Moderate Persistent, and Severe Persistent. This type ofasthma classification, based on severity, is important whendecisions must be made about management at the initialassessment of a patient. This is because asthma therapyinvolves a stepwise approach in which the level of therapyis increased as the severity of the asthma increases. The severity of a patient 's asthma may be classified into one of these four steps based on the clinical features present before treatment is begun ( Figure 5-6). When the patient is already on treatment, the classification ofseverity should be based on the clinical features presentand the step of the daily medication regimen that thepatient is currently on 60(Figure 5-7). Thus, a patient with ongoing symptoms of mild persistent asthma, despitebeing on the appropriate maintenance treatment for thisstep, should be regarded as having moderate persistentasthma. Similarly, a patient with ongoing symptoms ofmoderate persistent asthma, despite being on theappropriate maintenance treatment for this step, should beregarded as having severe persistent asthma. Thus, thecombination of the current level of symptoms and thecurrent maintenance treatment step should enable theestablishment of the patient's asthma severity and thecorresponding appropriate maintenance treatment. Onceasthma control is achieved and maintained for a sufficienttime, then a reduction in therapy should be tested. Ifcontrol is maintained, then the patient should bereclassified according to the new maintenance treatment. The severity of acute asthma exacerbations is oftenFigure 5-5.

Partridge. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEunderestimated by patients, their relatives, and their health care professional. The reasons for this are complex, butinclude a failure to use measurements of lung function forassessment. If severe asthma exacerbations are notrecognized and treated appropriately, such exacerbationscan be fatal 61. It is important to recognize that any patient with asthma, however mild on a chronic basis, may have asevere acute asthma exacerbation. Specific factors havebeen identified that are associated with a higher risk ofasthma mortality 62. These include a previous history of life-threatening acute attacks, hospitalization within theprevious year, psychosocial problems, a history ofintubation for asthma, recent reductions or cessation ofglucocorticosteroid therapy, and noncompliance withrecommended medical therapy. Time Trends of Airflow Limitation Asthma may also be classified according to time trend patterns of airflow limitation monitored by PEFmeasurements. This form of classification is likely toreflect the different pathological causes of airflow limitationand has therapeutic implications. Intermittent asthma maybe defined as the presence of occasional episodes ofrespiratory symptoms and PEF reductions (in the last year)with normal PEF and normal or near-normal airwayresponsiveness in between episodes. By contrast,persistent asthma is characterized by daytime andnocturnal PEF variability, frequent symptoms, and airwayhyperresponsiveness. Some patients with longstandingpersistent asthma with an irreversible component to theirdisease fail to achieve normal lung function despiteintensive therapy with glucocorticosteroids. The term\"brittle asthma\" is sometimes used to describe patients with airway hyperresponsiveness and extreme day-to-dayvariability in airway obstruction. These patients areparticularly at risk for sudden, severe, and life-threateningexacerbations. REFERENCES 1. Sears MR. Natural history and epidemiology.

DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION 79 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE80DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTECHAPTER 6 EDUCATION AND THE DELIVERY OF CARE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE82EDUCATION AND THE DELIVERY OF CAREThis chapter is concerned with the organization of health care professionals, the implementation of guidelines,patient education and self-management, and theeducation of family members, coaches, employers, andothers who may come in contact with people who haveasthma. It includes a number of tools that may be helpfulin the education of both patients and health professionals. The following conditions are essential to effective asthma care delivery: Sufficient numbers of well-educated health professionals should be organized effectively so that they are available to the maximum number of patients. Asthma should be correctly diagnosed, its severity assessed, and appropriate treatments prescribed. Adequate finances should be available to governments or individuals to ensure that asthma treatments areavailable (and means of providing less expensivemedications need to be explored). Patients should understand how to use the asthma treatments to maximal advantage. Although government officials make the decisions abouthealth care financing and personnel requirements, healthprofessionals should be consulted on these issues.Correct diagnosis and management of asthma and thecorrect use of appropriate treatments are issues directlyconcerned with the education of health care professionalsand their patients. Some of the methods suggested in thischapter may initially appear more expensive, but mayultimately lead to significant cost savings. Research has shown that currently there are deficiencies in most of the four essentials listed above. For example,delays in diagnosis are common 1and lead to inappropriate (non-asthma) treatments being given. Underdiagnosis ofasthma is mainly due to the failure of patients withKEY POINTS: Good asthma care requires sufficient numbers of well-educated health professionals organized so thatthey are available to the maximum number ofpatients. Guidelines on asthma management shouldbe available but adapted and adopted for local useby local asthma planning teams consisting of bothprimary and secondary care health professionals(Evidence D). Implementation of guidelines is most likely to be effective and result in alteration of healthprofessional behavior where there is practice-based education regarding the asthma guidelines, within-consultation prompting of behavior, andfeedback to health care professionals regarding their management (Evidence B). Patient education involves a partnership between the patient and health care professional(s) withfrequent revision and reinforcement. The aim isguided self-management- that is, giving patients the ability to control their own condition withguidance from the health care professionals.Interventions including the use of written self-management (action) plans have been shown toreduce morbidity in both adults ( Evidence A) and children (Evidence B). Clear communication between health care professionals and asthma patients to meet patients ' information needs is a key to enhancing compliance(Evidence B). Figure 6-1. Education: An Essential Part of theManagement of Asthma Why educate? Good education should reduce morbidity and mortality, keep people atwork and school, and reduce health costs (especially if it reduceshospitalization) and indirect costs. Who needs education? Policy-makers and planners -so they make asthma a priority and effect good organization of care Health care professionals -doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical students, and care assistants/field workers The wider public -teachers, employers, and coaches Patients (and their families and loved ones). What topics should be covered in education? Information about the content of clinical practice guidelines Information about the diagnosis Information about prevention of exacerbations and deterioration of lung function Training in (guided) self-management Ability to recognize deteriorating asthma Knowledge about the different treatments Training in proper use of medication inhalers and peak flow meters. How to educate? Educate the health care professionals and emphasize the importance of preventive management, i.e., managing asthma to preventsymptoms and exacerbations. Recognize that patient education involves: - giving information and acquisition of skills- altering behavior by the patient. Good communication and development of a partnership between patients and health care professionals are essential if barriers toeducation are to be overcome. Monitoring, auditing, and setting of standards are also essential parts of the process and the responsibility of officials and professional organizations. Where to educate? Education of health care professionals is necessary in schools and colleges, and by continuing medical education. Education of the wider public is necessary by articles in newspapers and journals and by programs on television. Education of patients is a continual process involving revision and reinforcement at each meeting with a health care professional.

In other cases asthma severity is underestimated, with the result that regular preventivetherapy is underused 3,4. Studies of both adults and children have shown that only about 50 percent of patientstake regular preventive therapies as previously advised bytheir doctor 5-7. In large surveys, considerable numbers of asthma patients report regular sleep disturbance andlimitation of daytime activities 8. These deficiencies may have particularly seriousconsequences for patients with severe asthma. One studyshowed that 74 percent of those admitted to the hospitalwith severe asthma could have had the admissionprevented by more appropriate prior care 9. Surveys of deaths from asthma have shown that nearly 90 percent ofcases involve avoidable factors 10. Studies also show that 78 percent of those who die from asthma have previouslybeen admitted to hospitals for asthma 11, and 40 percent have been admitted to the hospital in the 12 months priorto death 12. Patients who have a history of hospital admission for asthma, especially if they requiredmechanical ventilation, should be considered at high riskfor asthma-related death. Education and the teaching ofself-management skills may be especially important tothese patients, and lack of self-management educationmay increase the risk of emergency room visits amongpatients with poorly controlled asthma. Education is clearly an essential part of the overall management of asthma. An outline summary of therelevance of education to asthma is shown in Figure 6-1. Education includes education about primary prevention,secondary prevention, and management of asthma. THE ORGANIZATION AND EDUCATION OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS To ensure the proper organization of well-educated healthprofessionals within a country or within a district within acountry, an asthma planning team should be instituted(Evidence D). Likely members of such a team are shown in Figure 6-2. In some countries, such as Finland andPeru, asthma planning has been done at a national levelwith government health department collaboration; in othercountries, such as Australia, a National Asthma Campaignhas involved a coalition of health professional organizations,the government, pharmaceutical companies, and patientsupport organizations. Countries will vary so much for reasons of economics, culture, and environment that thepriorities and problems presented to each planning teammay vary considerably. Some of the issues that need tobe considered are shown in Figure 6-3. Guidelines Guidelines on asthma management should be adopted and adapted for local use by local asthma planning teamsconsisting of both primary and secondary care healthprofessionals ( Evidence D). Guidelines are used to ensure that all members of a patient 's health care team are aware of the goals of treatment and of the differentways of achieving these goals. They help set standards ofclinical care, may serve as a basis for audit, and act as astarting point for the education of health professionals.Sections on referral patterns may be used as a basis for EDUCATION AND THE DELIVERY OF CARE 83Figure 6-2.

Checklist of Issues for National or DistrictAsthma Planning Teams What is the size of the problem of asthma in this country or district? What arrangements will be made for shared care among different health care providers (doctors and nurses, hospital and primary care)? How will medical care be linked with community health facilities and educational initiatives? What are the major preventable factors in this country or district that could help prevent asthma from developing orcould prevent asthma exacerbations from occurring in thosewho already have asthma? What preconceived assumptions about asthma and its treatment and what cultural factors will need special attention? What treatments are currently used? How affordable and accessible are medications and services to the patient? What other treatments are available, cheap enough for purchase, and stable in our climatic conditions? Can we standardize inhaler devices and medicines to reduce cost/storage/availability problems? Who will provide emergency care? Which groups of the population are at special risk (e.g., inner city, poor, teenager, minority)? Whom can we enlist to help in education (community health workers/health-promotion facilitators/trained educatorscurrently working on other programs/self-help patientgroups)? Who will take responsibility for the education of health care professionals? Who will take responsibility for the education of patients? How can we integrate asthma education and treatment into other programs (e.g., child health)? COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE84EDUCATION AND THE DELIVERY OF CAREdeciding how different patients are cared for and working out shared care protocols. However, whether guidelines are national or international in scope, it is unlikely that their production alone willreduce asthma morbidity. Guidelines seem to be mosteffectively introduced to health care providers throughinteractive methods 13, a time-consuming but necessary process. Simply reading guidelines generally does notchange physicians ' delivery of care because information is necessary but it is rarely sufficient by itself to producechanges in behavior. Furthermore, guidelines are oftenlengthy and contain multiple messages referring todifferent situations and to different severities of disease;health care professionals need to have learning situationsin which they can consider how to adapt the guidelines totheir clinical populations. For successful dissemination and incorporation into clinical practice, comprehensive guidelines (such as the GINAguidelines) must be not only read by physicians but alsodiscussed in peer groups. In addition, and probably mostimportantly, doctors should receive daily prompting andfeedback to remind them to incorporate the content intotheir consultations. One study evaluating asthma care ingeneral practice before and after the publication of nationalasthma guidelines showed that dissemination alone hadhardly any effect on care, but direct feedback regardingphysicians' actual patient care resulted in a clear improvement in accordance with guidelines 14. Ideally, feedback should compare the behavior of individual health professionals not only with the(theoretical) behavior described in the guideline, but alsowith the actual behavior of their peers. Audit or providingthe health professional with an assessment of the care heor she is providing can lead to an alteration in behavior 15, but audits alone may give only negative feedback. Bycontrast, when the care provided is compared with thatprovided by peers and subsequently discussed with these peers, the health professional also receives positivefeedback. This creates a social learning situation, the best method for accomplishing clear changes in behavior. When teaching health professionals about asthma, it may be helpful to see the condition within the whole context ofrespiratory medicine to avoid overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis.Figure 6-4 provides key questions to ask about the patient's history. Several figures from other chapters inthis report may be easily reproduced for use by health careprofessionals as t eaching aids or as consultation room reminders or prompts. Monitoring Process and OutcomeIn addition to setting up a system to deliver care to patients with asthma through trained health care professionals, it is also essential to set up a system for monitoring theeffectiveness and quality of care. Such monitoringinvolves surveillance of traditional epidemiological parameters, such as morbidity and mortality, as well as thespecific audit of both process and outcome within differentsections of the health care system. Process parameters are defined as parameters that characterize asthma carein practice, while outcome parameters refer to the effects this care has on the patient with asthma. Effective assessmentof these parameters requires the determination anddefinition of minimum sets of data that can be audited.Each country needs to determine its own minimum sets ofdata to audit. Examples include the following. To audit process ask: Was a record kept of the patient 's technique for taking medication (for example, using an inhaler or a nebulizer) and their understanding of when and how to take eachmedication? Was the patient on an appropriate step of therapy for the severity of his or her asthma? Was a record kept of advice given about how to recognize deteriorating asthma and how to handleexacerbations? Figure 6-4. Key Questions for Considering Asthma* IS IT ASTHMA? Ask patients or parents these key questions: Has the patient had an attack or recurrent attacks of wheezing? Consider asthma. Does the patient have a troublesome cough at night? Consider asthma. Does the patient have a cough or wheeze after exercise?Consider asthma. Does the patient have a cough, wheeze, or chesttightness after exposure to airborne allergens or pollutants?Consider asthma. Do the patient' s colds \" go to the chest\" or take more than 10 days to clear up? Consider asthma. Does the patient use anti-asthma medication? (How often?) Consider asthma. If the patient answers \"yes\" to any of the questions, a diagnosis of asthma may be likely. However, it is important to remember the possibility of pulmonary emboli, heart disease, and anemiaas alternative causes of respiratory symptoms. *These questions may be produced in poster form for clinics or as cartoons. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEThe UK Royal College of Physicians of London has recently reviewed strategies for auditing outcomes, and concluded that at each consultation the patient 's answers to the following questions should be recorded16: In the last week or month: Have you had difficulty sleeping because of your asthma (including cough)? Have you had your usual asthma symptoms during the day (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, or breathlessness)? Has your asthma interfered with your usual activities (e.g., housework, work, school, etc.)? A prompt stamp (a standardized note put into the patient 's record) such as the Tayside Asthma Assessment Stampmay be used to help remind health care providers to askthese questions during consultations 16,17. An electronic version of this stamp is displayed at http://www.srs.org.uk. PATIENT EDUCATION The aim of patient education, which is a continual process,is to provide the patient with asthma and the patient 's family with suitable information and training so that thepatient can keep well and adjust treatment according to amedication plan developed in advance with the health careprofessional. The emphasis must be on the developmentof an ongoing partnership among health care professionals,the patient, and the patient 's family. Patient education should aim to: Increase understanding Increase skills Increase satisfaction Increase confidence, and thereby to Increase compliance and self-management. Basic education should be provided over several consultations or visits. Education should be provided topatients of all ages. Although the focus of education forsmall children will be on the parents, children as young as3 years of age can be taught simple asthma managementskills. Teenagers may have some unique difficultiesregarding compliance that may be helped through peersupport group education in addition to education providedby the health care professional. Revision andreinforcement are essential components of educationprovided by the health care professional. Figure 6-5 outlines the basic features of a patient education program,Figure 6-5. Individualizing Education in a Stepwise Manner The goal: To provide the patient and his or her family with suitable information and training so that the patient can keep well and adjust treatment according to a medication plan devel-oped with the health care professional. Key components: The development of a partnership Acceptance that this is a continuing process A sharing of information Full discussion of expectations Expression of fears and concerns The patient then requires information about: Diagnosis Difference between \" relievers\" and \" controllers\" Training in use of inhaler devices Advice regarding prevention Signs that suggest asthma is worsening and actions to take Training in monitoring asthma Advice about how and when to seek medical attention The patient then requires: A guided self-management plan Regular supervision, revision, reward, and reinforcement Figure 6-6. Prevention: A Patient Checklist What should I avoid? Active smoking Passive smoking Beta-blockers (tablets and eye drops) Aspirin (and NSAIDs) where previously adverselyaffected Occupational agents (to which the patient has become sensitized) What should I consider and avoid or modify exposure to, if relevant to me? Domestic mites Other common allergens Adverse occupational environments Foods and additives Adverse indoor environments What should I always undertake, if necessary byadjusting treatment? Normal social activities Exercise (other than in certain very adverse environmental conditions) Sports Always mention to the health care professional anything else that may affect your asthma (for example, menstruation,alcohol). EDUCATION AND THE DELIVERY OF CARE 85 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEand Figure 6-6 provides a patient checklist of what to avoid to prevent an asthma exacerbation. The information and skill training required by individual patients vary, andeach patient' s ability or willingness to take responsibility similarly differs. Thus all individuals require certain coreinformation and skills, but most education must bepersonalized and given to the patient in a number of steps.Social and psychological support may also be required tomaintain positive behavioral change. Further, the patient 's understanding of the information and management skillsshould be assessed periodically so that educational stepsmay be repeated or added as appropriate. Improving ComplianceStudies of adults and children 18have shown noncompliance rates of around 50 percent with the taking of regular preventive therapies. Noncompliance may bedefined in a nonjudgmental way as the failure of treatmentto be taken as agreed upon by the patient and the healthcare professional. Noncompliance may be identified byprescription monitoring, pill counting, or drug assay, but ata clinical level it is best detected by asking about therapyin a way that acknowledges the likelihood of incompletecompliance (e.g., \" So that we may plan therapy, do you mind telling me how often you find that you actually takethe medicine?\" ). Specific drug and nondrug factors involved in noncompliance are listed in Figure 6-7. Compliance can usually be increased: If the patient accepts the diagnosis of asthma If the patient believes that his or her asthma may be dangerous or is a problem If the patient believes that he or she is at risk If the patient believes that the treatment is safe If the patient feels in control If there is good communication between patient and health care professional. The importance of good communication as the basis for subsequent good compliance cannot be underestimated 1,19-21 (Evidence B). Key factors in good communication are22: A congenial demeanor (friendliness, humor, and attentiveness) Engaging in interactive dialogue Giving encouragement and praise Empathy, reassurance, and prompt handling of any concerns Giving of appropriate (personalized) information Eliciting shared goals Feedback and review. Teaching health care professionals enhanced communication skills can result in measurably betterpatient outcomes- including increased patient satisfaction, better health, and reduced use of health care -and these benefits may be achieved without any increase inconsultation times 23. Recent studies have also shown that patients can be trained to benefit more from consultations.In one study, patients taught how to give information to doctors in a clearer manner, information-seekingtechniques, and methods of checking their understandingof what the doctor had told them gained significantimprovements in compliance and overall health 24. Methods of Delivery Patients can acquire information about asthma and its treatment by: Listening to the health care professional Reading a book or cartoon, watching a video, or listening to an audiotape Figure 6-7. Factors Involved in Noncompliance Drug factors Difficulties with inhaler devices Awkward regimes (e.g., four times daily or multiple drugs)Side effectsCost of medicationDislike of medicationDistant pharmacies Nondrug factors Misunderstanding or lack of instructionFears about side effectsDissatisfaction with health care professionalsUnexpressed/undiscussed fears or concernsInappropriate expectationsPoor supervision, training, or follow-upAnger about condition or its treatmentUnderestimation of severityCultural issuesStigmatizationForgetfulness or complacencyAttitudes toward ill healthReligious issues 86EDUCATION AND THE DELIVERY OF CARE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE Attending an asthma educational course Attending a public meeting or a patient support group to learn from other patients with asthma Reading articles in magazines or newspapers Watching television programs or listening to the radio Using the World Wide Web or interactive multimedia. Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of various methods of asthma education. One conclusion isthat patient preference does not always equate witheffectiveness. For example, one study showed patientspreferring a book to an audiotape, but the latter wasactually more effective in terms of knowledge gained 25. Further, studies demonstrate that interventions involvingthe giving of information alone may improve patientknowledge, but do not necessarily lead to improvement in lung function or reduction in use of health serviceresources 26,27. What can lead to improved control of asthma are more interactive educational interventionscoupled with personalization of advice 28,29. For example, three educational sessions on asthma conducted by a specially trained nurse may be sufficient to reduce thenumber of patients reattending emergency departmentswith out-of-control asthma. Attendance at an \"asthma class\" has also produced reduced hospitalization and emergency visits for at least 12 months after theintervention 30. In another controlled trial, intervention in the form of a 30-minute one-to-one session, a 60-minuteattendance at an asthma support group, and two brieftelephone reinforcement calls increased practical skills as well as compliance, with the benefit extending over a 12-month period 31. Discerning which component of an intervention (givinginformation, closer medical care, self-management, orfollowup and enhanced supervision) has been mosteffective is not always easy. What is probably mosteffective is to give information verbally and then by severalother routes- with those routes selected on the basis of patient education status and literacy level 32. Instruction via videos may be more appropriate than leaflets in someinstances and has been shown to be useful in teachinggood inhaler techniques. (Information about differenttypes of inhalers and their use can be found on the GINAwebsite (http://www.ginasthma.com). Many patients appear to benefit by being put in touch with patient support groups as a supplement to education bythe health care professional. The format of these groupsvaries from country to country and from area to area, butmost provide information materials, and many provideopportunities for group education, mutual support, andexchange of personal tips on managing asthma andcoping with the stress a chronic disorder can present topatients and their families. Such patient support groupsexist in a number of countries, and some are listed on theGINA website (http://www.ginasthma.com). Education at Initial ConsultationIn early consultation the patient with asthma needs information about the diagnosis and simple informationabout the types of treatment available and about therationale for the specific therapeutic interventions beingrecommended. For example, different inhaler devicesshould be demonstrated, and patients should take part in adecision as to which is most suitable for them. Some ofthese devices and techniques for their use are illustratedon the GINA website (http://www.ginasthma.com). Additional devices are becoming available each year. Itmay be useful to use a criterion-based performance checklist for teaching patients about inhaler techniques.Patients should be advised about secondary preventionmeasures- for example, to avoid cigarette smoke as well as to avoid allergens, occupational sensitizing agents, anddrugs known to cause asthma exacerbations in anindividual. The consequences of ongoing exposure tosuch chronic pollutants and allergens even when theexposure does not always lead to an exacerbation shouldbe explained. Advising patients to avoid such day-to-daytriggers as exercise and cold air generally imposesinappropriate restrictions, and it is often preferable toadjust treatment to prevent exacerbations precipitated byexposure to these. Patients should be given adequate opportunity to express their expectations of both the asthma and its treatment. A frank appraisal should be made of how far theirexpectations may or may not be met, and agreementshould be made about specific goals for therapy. In manycases, it is up to the health care professional to raisepatients' level of expectations. It is reasonable for most patients to expect: Freedom from symptoms day and night No restriction on activities, including sports Best possible lung function (e.g., peak expiratory flow). At the initial consultation, verbal information should be supplemented by the provision of written (or pictorial, forlow-literacy-level patients) 33information about asthma and its treatment. The patient and the patient 's family should be encouraged to make note of any questions that arisefrom reading this information or as a result of theconsultation. Patients should understand that time will be EDUCATION AND THE DELIVERY OF CARE 87 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEset aside for further information and for answering questions during each subsequent consultation. During this initial visit, or a followup consultation if necessary, the concept of peak expiratory flow (PEF)monitoring should be considered as appropriate to thepatient' s age, ability, and clinical assessment. Patients, especially those with more than mild disease, shouldreceive training in how to measure and record PEF. Thetechnique of rapid exhalation required for peak flow meteruse is very different from the slow breathing required forusing metered-dose inhalers; this may be confusing topatients and thus requires careful instruction. Whenpatients are taught how to record and interpret their PEF, itis helpful to explain that in addition to the absolute value ofpeak expiratory flow, its variability is important. The patientshould understand that such monitoring is undertaken tocheck on the effectiveness of therapy and to give earlywarning of potential deterioration. It may be helpful tostress that PEF monitoring is not done merely for thehealth care professional 's record, but rather provides critical information for making decisions about treatment,and thus PEF monitoring is a tool for patients to help themselves. The aim then is for patients to be offered training in self- management techniques. A recent systematic review bythe Cochrane Airways group 34of 22 studies involving patient education compared with usual care showedsignificant benefits in the intervention groups in terms ofreduced morbidity and reduced use of health services.The effects were greatest where the intervention involvedthe issuing of written self-management action plans(Evidence A). Guided Self-Management and Personal Asthma Action Plans In guided self-management or asthma self-management, individual asthma patients make changes to theirtreatment in response to changes in the severity of theirasthma, in accordance with predetermined guidelines 22,35. The process involves the integration of assessment andtreatment, and incorporates written guidelines for bothlong-term treatment of asthma and treatment ofexacerbations. Followup and supervision by the healthcare provider is also an important contributor to thesuccess of this strategy. The concept of guided self-management arose as clinicians realized that delays in recognizing asthmaexacerbations and initiating appropriate therapy areimportant factors contributing to asthma morbidity andmortality 10,36,37. Moreover, they knew that the majority ofasthma attacks occur in the community and are managedby patients without immediate consultation with a doctor.This situation caused physicians to try to develop ways to teach asthma patients how to recognize and treatasthma attacks in accordance with current medicalknowledge. Guided self-management has been promoted in nearly all national and international asthma guidelines. The basic principles of guided self-management are shown in Figure 6-8. A number of specific systems of guided self-managementhave been developed and shown to be effective in themanagement of adult asthma 34,38-45. Examples of self- management plans that have been recommended can be found on several web sites (UK National AsthmaCampaign Plan, http://www.asthma.org.uk; InternationalAsthma Management \"Credit Card\" System, http://www.asthmanz.co.nz). Assessment Fundamental to the success of guided self-management is the ability of the patient to recognize deterioration inasthma control. The patient must be taught to assessasthma severity by interpreting key symptoms andperforming measurements of peak flow 46-48. Simple advice to seek medical attention if there are any nighttimesymptoms, especially nocturnal wakening, or if symptomsdo not respond to increased use of inhaled /H92522-agonist therapy may be the most important message to convey 49,50. Domiciliary measurements of peak flow, with valuesFigure 6-8. The Basic Principles of Guided Self-Management in Adult Asthma Patients are taught to combine objective assessment of asthma severity (peak flow recordings) with educated interpretation of key symptoms. Patients are taught which medication to use regularly and which medication to use as needed. This mayinclude as-needed /H92522-agonist therapy or, for patients with severe asthma, systemic glucocorticosteroids,high-dose inhaled /H92522-agonists, oxygen therapy, and medical review. Self-assessment and self-management are integrated with written guidelines for both the long-term treatment of asthma and the treatment ofasthma exacerbations. 88EDUCATION AND THE DELIVERY OF CARE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEinterpreted as a percentage of normal predicted or previous best achieved recordings, are used as anobjective assessment of the degree of airflow obstruction.Objective measurements are important because studiessuggest that many patients are unable to reliably detectchanges in their lung function -that is, they cannot correlate their subjective perception of asthma withmeasurements of lung function such as peak expiratoryflow 47. This diminished perception of lung function changes may correlate with the severity of the underlyingasthma 51and is associated with an increased risk of death52, so peak flow monitoring is particularly important in adults with severe asthma. Followup and Supervision There is increasing evidence that self-management and inhaler skills need regular reinforcement by the health care professional. Moreover, a reduction in asthmatherapy can only be adopted if the patient is seen regularlyfor followup. At the followup consultation, the patient 's questions are discussed, and any problems with asthma and its initial treatment are reviewed. Followup consultations at regularintervals should include checking the patient 's inhaler technique and adherence to the medication plan andenvironmental control recommendations. Symptoms (and where appropriate, home peak flow recordings) noted in the patient diary are also reviewed regularly.Review of home PEF and symptom monitoring isnecessary to assure that the goals of therapy are met andappropriate adjustments in therapy are made. After aperiod of initial training, the frequency of home peak flowand symptom monitoring depends in part on the severity of the patient' s asthma. Patients with mild to moderate asthma with infrequent attacks can be advised to monitortheir control during exacerbations only, whereas patientswith more severe or \" brittle\" asthma should undertake more regular monitoring. Self-Management in Children Just like adults, children with asthma (and their parents) need to know how to self-manage their own condition.Simple educational interventions (designed to teach self-management skills) among children admitted to thehospital with asthma have been shown to significantlyreduce the readmission rate and reduce morbidity 53. This is especially important because asthma is a common reasonfor children to be admitted to the hospital, and this cancause considerable disruption to other family membersand interfere with education.Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness Guided self-management plans, based on the above struc- ture and principles, have been shown to lead to significantreductions in morbidity and patients ' need for medical services 34,38-42,44(Evidence A). Patients experience a one- third to two-thirds reduction in hospitalizations, emergencyroom visits, unscheduled visits to the doctor for asthma,missed days of work, and nocturnal wakening. It has beenestimated that the implementation of a self-managementprogram in 20 patients prevents 1 hospitalization, andsuccessful completion of such a program by 8 patientsprevents 1 emergency department visit 22. Less detailed or intensive interventions that involve self-managementeducation but not a written plan are less effective. Self-management plans based on either peak flow or symptoms are of similar efficacy 43(Evidence B), so the method of self-monitoring should be tailored to patient skill levels, preferences, and resources. Similar efficacyresults from guided self-management plans in whichpatients self-adjust their medications according to anindividual written plan, and regular review and adjustmentof medication by a doctor 32(Evidence B). Thus, patients who are unable to undertake guided self-management canstill achieve benefit from a structured program of regularmedical review. Economic evaluation of asthma self-management programs has shown them to be cost effective, largelybecause they reduce patients ' use of health care resources. The cost-benefit ratios in published studies arebetween 1:2.5 and 1:7 29,44(Evidence B). However, further studies in this area are clearly needed. Special SituationsIndividualization of asthma therapy and the use of written guided self-management plans enable patients tocope with most situations, but trips away from home may require special planning. Particularly helpful may be apreholiday or pretravel check with the health careprofessional during which patients can get advice abouttaking along a sufficient quantity of routine and emergencymedication, keeping the medication available during travel,remembering to take medication despite the differentroutine of a holiday, and checking in advance on how tofind local medical attention if it should become necessary. Pregnant patients may be counseled about possibilities for preventing the development of asthma in their babies.Although more research is needed, evidence suggests thatbreast feeding and reducing an infant 's exposure to indoor allergens, especially domestic mites, and reducing EDUCATION AND THE DELIVERY OF CARE 89 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEexposure to maternal smoking could prevent the onset of asthma. This may be particularly relevant for the childrenof patients with allergies because atopy occurs in familiesand is the single most important risk factor for thedevelopment of asthma. THE EDUCATION OF OTHERS The education of the general public about asthma ishelpful in that it enables members of the public torecognize asthma symptoms and encourages those withasthma to seek medical attention and follow their asthmamanagement program. Greater awareness of the conditionis also likely to reduce feelings of stigmatization and tohelp dispel misconceptions that may exist about the condition. Specific advice about asthma and its management should be offered to school teachers and physical educationinstructors, and several organizations produce suchmaterials for this purpose. It is also helpful for employersto have access to clear advice about asthma. Mostoccupations are as suitable for those with asthma as forthose without, but there may be some circumstanceswhere caution is needed.

Although there is nocure for asthma, appropriate management most oftenleads to control of the disorder. The goals for successful management of asthma are to: Achieve and maintain control of symptoms Prevent asthma exacerbations Maintain pulmonary function as close to normal levels as possible Maintain normal activity levels, including exercise Avoid adverse effects from asthma medications Prevent development of irreversible airflow limitation Prevent asthma mortality. These goals for therapy reflect an understanding of asthma as a chronic disorder with progressively developingchronic airway inflammation leading to recurrent episodesof such airway responses as airflow limitation, mucusproduction, and cough. Numerous clinical studies haveshown that any asthma more severe than mild, intermittentasthma is more effectively controlled by intervening tosuppress and reverse the inflammation rather than by onlytreating the bronchoconstriction and related symptoms 1-3. Furthermore, early intervention to stop exposure to the riskfactors that sensitized the airway should result in optimalcontrol of the disease 4, although the long-term results of specific avoidance measures are not yet known. It is note-worthy that experience in occupational asthma indicatesthat longstanding exposure to sensitizing agents may leadto irreversible disease 5.The management of asthma can be approached indifferent ways, depending on the availability of the variousforms of asthma treatment and taking into account culturalpreferences and differing health care systems. Thischapter reviews the different approaches to asthmamanagement; discusses the relative efficacy, applicability,safety, and cost of the approaches; and integrates theapproaches into a recommended six-part asthmamanagement program. The recommendations in this chapter link the rationale for the therapies to the scientific understanding of asthma. They are based as far as possible on controlledclinical studies, and the text references many of thesestudies. For those aspects of the clinical management ofasthma that have not been the subject of specific clinicalstudies, the recommendations are based on the literaturereview, clinical experience, and expert opinion of projectmembers. Asthma management has six interrelated parts: 1. Educate patients to develop a partnership in asthma management 2. Assess and monitor asthma severity with both symptom reports and, as much as possible, measurements of lung function 3. Avoid exposure to risk factors 4. Establish individual medication plans for long-term management in children and adults 5. Establish individual plans for managing exacerbations6. Provide regular followup care.INTRODUCTION COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEA SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 95Asthma severity can be judged by measurements of symptoms, measurements of lung function, andmedication requirements as discussed in the chapter ondiagnosis and classification. MEASUREMENTS OF SYMPTOMS Structured questionnaires to be filled in by the patient or by the health care professional can be used to quantify orscore patients' reports of their different asthma symptoms over a period of time. Many such questionnaires havebeen developed, but few have as yet been validatedagainst other objective measurements of asthma severity.However, carefully administered serial questionnaires canbe a sensitive method for detecting a deterioration ofasthma 6. The specific questions about symptoms should depend on the objectives of the questionnaire and thecultural setting. Particularly important questions inmonitoring the patient's asthma and the patient's responseto therapy are how frequently the patient is using relievermedication, and how frequently the patient hasexperienced nighttime symptoms such as cough,wheezing, or breathlessness. Questions about howfrequently the patient limits normal activities may also behelpful. A visual analog scale to measure dyspnea hasbeen demonstrated to be a reasonable tool for measuringand monitoring asthma severity in individual patients whenmore objective tests are not available 7. MEASUREMENTS OF LUNG FUNCTION Lung function (pulmonary function) studies are essential for diagnosing and assessing the severity of asthma inpatients over 5 years old. The measurements provide anindirect assessment of airway hyperresponsiveness, whichmay correlate with the degree of airway inflammation. Measurements of lung function should also be used to monitor the course of asthma and the patient' s response to therapy. Poor perception of the severity of asthmasymptoms on the part of the patient and health careprofessional may be a major factor causing delay intreatment and thus may contribute to increased morbidityand mortality from asthma exacerbations 8. Patients who have access to peak expiratory flow (PEF) informationmay use their medication less frequently and moreappropriately. Measurement of lung function formonitoring asthma is analogous to measurement in otherchronic diseases. For example, blood pressuremeasurements with a sphygmomanometer are used formonitoring hypertension, and blood glucosemeasurements with reagent strips or digital read-outmeters are used for monitoring diabetes.KEY POINTS: Asthma severity can be judged by measurements of symptoms, measurements of lung function, and medication requirements. Pulmonary function studies are essential for diagnosing and assessing the severity of asthma inpatients over 5 years old. Measures of lung functionshould also be used to monitor the course of asthmaand the patient' s response to therapy. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring is an important clinical tool in the office, emergencydepartment, and hospital, and is useful in the home.PART 1: EDUCATE PATIENTS TO DEVELOP A PARTNERSHIP IN ASTHMA MANAGEMENT Patient education is a continual process. The patient with asthma and his or her family must be provided withsuitable information and training so that the patient cansuccessfully achieve control, adjust medication as neededaccording to a management plan developed with thehealth care professional, and maintain a satisfactoryquality of life. The emphasis must be on developing apartnership among the health care professional(s), thepatient, and the patient 's family. The chapter on education and delivery of care explores in depth this importantpartnership and the essential elements of teachingindividual patients about asthma management. PART 2: ASSESS AND MONITOR ASTHMA SEVERITY WITH MEASUREMENTS OF SYMPTOMS AND MEASUREMENTS OF LUNG FUNCTION COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE96A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAMSpirometry is recommended in the initial assessment of most patients with suspected asthma and periodically inselected patients to confirm home PEF measurementsmade with a peak flow meter. Subsequent measurementof PEF may be sufficient in most cases as the minimumobjective parameter to follow in assessing symptoms andmaking therapeutic recommendations, when suchrecommendations depend on the severity of airflowlimitation. For individual cases with complex questionsrelated to their pulmonary function, periodic assessment ina specialized pulmonary testing facility should beconsidered. PEF monitoring is an important clinical tool in the office, emergency department, and hospital and is useful in thehome. It is valuable to assess severity, assess degree ofdiurnal variation in lung function, monitor response totherapy during an acute exacerbation, detectasymptomatic deterioration of lung function in the homeand office and intervene before it becomes more serious,monitor response to chronic therapy, provide objectivejustification for therapy to the patient, and identify triggers,including occupational sensitizers 9. Regular measurement of PEF in the health care professional 's office is recommended. Monitoring PEF during the assessment ofacute exacerbations in the health care professional's officeor emergency department is essential. Daily or twice daily PEF home monitoring by the patient is indicated in the initial assessment of the severity of theasthma and the response to therapy. Regular PEF homemonitoring for several months or years may be especiallyuseful to patients over 5 years of age with persistentasthma, but might not be necessary for many patients.When priorities have to be set because of a shortage ofPEF meters, continued home monitoring beyond initialassessment is particularly recommended for patients whohave been hospitalized and for patients who are poorperceivers of their airflow limitation, i.e., they have difficultyrecognizing early symptoms and are thus at increased riskfor life-threatening asthma exacerbations. These patientsmight be identified during the initial monitoring andassessment period and by observing their perception ofthe severity of an acute exacerbation. Measurement of PEFMost adults, as well as children as young as 5 years of age, usually can perform a PEF measurement. The effortrequired to produce the measurement is a full inspiration tototal lung capacity followed by a short maximal exhalationin a standing position. Because PEF measurement iseffort dependent, patients need to be coached initially togive their best effort. For both spirometry and PEFmeasurements, it is essential to use correct techniquesand equipment 9-14. Ideally, PEF measurements should be taken twice daily,immediately upon arising and 10 to 12 hours later, beforeand after using a bronchodilator if a bronchodilator isneeded. If PEF measurements are taken only once daily,they should be done in the morning upon arising andconsistently before using a bronchodilator, if abronchodilator is needed. A few patients will not comply,or their asthma will become extremely stable, and theymay prefer to perform PEF measurements intermittently.Although this method loses the benefit of detecting earlydeterioration in lung function, it still provides importantinformation about variability. If PEF is being measuredonly 2 or 3 times a week, it is best to do both a morningand an evening reading on the same day and consistentlyeither before or after using a bronchodilator, if a bronchodilatoris taken, so that any variation greater than 20 percent(which indicates worsening of asthma) can be detected. Interpreting PEF measurements. Predicted values of PEF are corrected for height, sex, race, and age, and normal limits of diurnal (or circadian) variability areavailable in the literature 15-18. However, in many patients, PEF values are consistently higher or lower than theaverage predicted values. It is recommended that PEFobjectives for therapy be based on each patient's personalbest and daily variability rather than on a percent of normalpredicted value, particularly for patients with chronicallyimpaired lung function. Establishing personal best values and minimum diurnal variability when the patient is under effective treatment is important. During a monitoring period of 2 to 3 weeks,the patient should record PEF measurements at leasttwice a day. On both occasions the patient shouldmeasure the PEF three times and note the highest number. If the patient takes a bronchodilator, then PEF should bemeasured before and after using the bronchodilator. The personal best is the highest PEF measurementachieved when the patient 's asthma is under control. If the patient' s highest value during the monitoring period is less than 80 percent of predicted value after taking abronchodilator (if the patient takes a bronchodilator), ordaily variability is more than 20 percent again after taking a bronchodilator, more aggressive therapy andcontinued daily monitoring are indicated. A course of oral steroids in the initial evaluation period may be neededto establish personal best and minimum PEF dailyvariability. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEAlthough pharmacological intervention to treat established asthma is highly effective in controlling symptoms andimproving quality of life, every attention should be given tomeasures to prevent this chronic, lifelong, and incurabledisease. Three levels of prevention have been describedand, in relation to asthma, include the following 21: Primary prevention is introduced before exposure to risk factors known to be associated with a disease. The goal is to prevent the onset of disease in susceptible (at-risk)individuals. This is not yet possible in asthma. Increasingevidence indicates that allergic sensitization is the mostcommon precursor to the development of asthma. Sincesensitization can occur antenatally 22,23, much of the focus of primary prevention will likely be on perinatal interventions. Secondary prevention is employed after primary sensitization to allergen(s) has occurred, but before there is any evidence of disease. The aim is to prevent theestablishment of chronic, persistent disease in people whoare susceptible and who have early signs of the disease.This is currently being investigated in asthma. Secondaryprevention of asthma is likely to focus very specifically onthe first year or two of life. Tertiary prevention involves avoidance of allergens and nonspecific triggers when asthma is established. The goal is to prevent exacerbations or illness that would otherwiseoccur with exposure to identified allergens or irritants. It isconsidered that tertiary prevention should be introducedwhen the first signs of asthma have occurred. However,increasing evidence would suggest that the histopathologyof the disease is fully established by the time asthmasymptoms occur 24. A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 97The variability of PEF provides a reasonable index of asthma stability and severity. One method of describingdiurnal PEF variability is as the amplitude (the differencebetween the prebronchodilator morning value and thepostbronchodilator value from the evening before)expressed as a percentage of the mean daily PEF value 18. Another method is the minimum morning prebronchodilatorPEF over 1 week, expressed as a percent of the recentbest (Min%Max) 19(Figure 5-3). This latter method has been suggested to be the best PEF index of airway labilitybecause it requires only a once-daily reading, it correlatesbetter than any other index with airway hyperresponsiveness,and the calculation is simple. Using PEF measurements to manage asthma. To help patients manage their asthma at home, a system of PEF zones can be used 20. This system correlates PEF measurements and variability with appropriate levels ofmedication to control asthma. The specific zones areestablished as a function of the individual 's personal best or predicted value, whichever is highest, and/or dailyvariability. The emphasis is not on an isolated reading butrather on the variability from the patient 's personal best or from one reading to the next. Supervising home PEF monitoring. Several elements appear to be essential for the successful integration of home peak expiratory flow monitoring into the treatmentplan. The following guidelines should be used: Educate the patient and family about the purpose and technique of home monitoring. Education should include: How and when to use the peak flow meter How to record PEF measurements in a diary How to interpret the measurements How to respond to change What information to communicate to the health care professional (including emergency department health care professionals). Explain how the health care professional uses the home PEF data to choose and evaluate treatment. KEY POINTS: Although pharmacological intervention to treat established asthma is highly effective in controllingsymptoms and improving quality of life, everyattention should be given to measures to prevent this chronic, lifelong, and incurable disease. Asthma exacerbations may be caused by a variety of risk factors including allergens, pollutants, foods, and drugs. Tertiary prevention aims to reduce theexposure to these risk factors to improve the controlof asthma and reduce medication needs.PART 3: AVOID EXPOSURE TO RISK FACTORS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE98A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAMA prerequisite for establishing any form of preventive strategy is to have reliable markers that predict theprogression of a disease, but to date there are no suchmarkers available for asthma. At all levels of prevention,many of the issues remain speculative and have yet to beput to the test in proper long-term controlled clinicalstudies, though many such studies are in progress. PRIMARY PREVENTION It is clear from the development of immuneresponsiveness that future strategies for primaryprevention of asthma will concentrate on the prenatal andperinatal periods. A number of factors have been shownto either increase or decrease the likelihood of fetal sensiti-zation to allergens, but the influence of these factors iscomplex and varies with gestational age. Primaryprevention of asthma is not yet possible, but promisingleads are being actively investigated. Potential Measures to be Applied Prenatally In the second trimester of pregnancy, when antigen- presenting-cell and T-cell maturity is sufficient for allergensensitization to occur, the most likely route of fetalsensitization is via the gut, although the concentration ofallergen able to penetrate the amnion may be critical.Paradoxically, low-dose allergen exposure may be morelikely to result in sensitization than high-dose exposure 25. Thus, there is considerable concern that there isinsufficient information on the critical doses and timing of exposure that might be associated with the developmentof either sensitization or tolerance. Indeed, there is even limited evidence to suggest that high-dose exposurewill induce IgG antibody production in the mother andthereby reduce the possibility of allergy developing in theoffspring. High cord blood IgG concentrations ofantibodies to cat dander and the major allergen of birchpollen have been associated with fewer allergic symptomsin children during the first 8 years of life 26. One study has shown reduced allergic sensitization in children ofmothers who received specific immunotherapy duringpregnancy 27. Prescription of a food-allergen-avoidance diet to a high-risk woman during pregnancy is unlikely to reducesubstantially her risk of giving birth to an atopic child 28. Moreover, such a diet may have an adverse effect onmaternal and/or fetal nutrition. In summary, there are no measures applied prenatally that can be recommended at this time for primaryprevention.Potential Measures To Be Applied Postnatally Early efforts at allergen avoidance have focused on infant feeding and, in particular, early avoidance of cow 's milk protein and sometimes eggs, fish, and nuts. Most studieshave commenced avoidance in the postnatal period, andresults have been inconclusive. The two studies 29,30that have had the longest followup have both identified atransient effect of avoidance on reducing food allergy andatopic dermatitis. Continued followup has shown adiminishing and eventually no effect on allergicmanifestations in the respiratory tract. The conclusionfrom one of these studies was that the effort required foran allergen-avoidance diet was not justified by theoutcome 30. Furthermore, there is at least limited evidence that early dietary manipulation may create a risk ofimpaired growth. Therefore, great caution is required inemploying such approaches 31. Prescription of an antigen-avoidance diet to a high-riskwoman during lactation may substantially reduce herchild's risk of developing atopic eczema, but better trialsare needed 32(Evidence C). Aeroallergen avoidance has been promoted in order toavoid sensitization, and a correlation between the level ofallergen exposure in infants and sensitization to allergenshas been shown in some 33but not all34studies. Moreover, recent studies suggest that, contrary to previouslypublished results, avoidance of early exposure to catsdoes not prevent allergy 35,36, and that early contact with cats and dogs may in fact prevent allergy more effectivelythan avoidance of these animals 37,38. These controversial results have led to the suggestionthat, in the future, primary prevention strategies will bedesigned to redirect the newborn infant 's immune response toward a Th1, nonallergic response. Efforts toestablish a proper Th1/Th2 balance might be achieved byhigh-dose exposure to relevant allergens (as distinct fromthe normal low-dose exposure) and by the utilization offusion proteins combining allergen and cytokines such asIL-12 39. These approaches have gained considerable credibility in relation to the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" which has identified associations between early microbial experienceand subsequent reduced allergic disease 40. Young children with older siblings and those who attendday care are at increased risk for infections, which in turnmay protect against the development of allergic diseases,including asthma 41. Repeated viral infections other than lower respiratory tract infections early in life may reducethe risk of developing asthma up to school age 42. There are some specific infections that may have an asthma- COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEA SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 99promoting role. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis has been clearly associated with a higherprevalence of recurrent wheezing disorders, although it iscontroversial whether this is associated with a greater riskof allergic sensitization 43. Thus, one unresolved issue is whether RSV actually predisposes to allergic diseases orwhether atopic individuals are more likely to get severeRSV bronchiolitis. Rather than focusing on active infection to modify outcomes, it is perhaps more appropriate to consider theinfant' s gut colonization by microbial flora 44. It has been shown that in countries with a low prevalence of atopy(e.g., Estonia), there are very different intestinal bacteriathan in countries with a higher atopic disease prevalence(e.g., Sweden) 45. A study on probiotics administered perinatally showed that, although the occurrence of atopicdermatitis was halved in the group of subjects receivingprobiotics, there was no change in overall allergicsensitization 46. In summary, the most promising opportunities for primaryprevention to be applied postnatally will beimmunomodulation using Th1 antigen in association with IL-12 or IFN- /H9253, or oral administration of relevant gut microorganisms. However,all of these strategies currently remain in the realm ofhypothesis and require appropriate investigation. Environmental Tobacco SmokeNo discussion of the primary prevention of asthma would be complete without considering the impact ofenvironmental tobacco smoke. The health effects ofpassive smoking have been extensively reviewed 47,48. The data related to parental smoking and lower respiratoryillness in exposed children up to 3 years of age indicate adirect causal relationship between these factors.However, it is impossible to distinguish the independentcontributions of prenatal and postnatal maternal smoking 49. In-depth studies of lung function immediately after birthhave shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy hasan influence on lung development 50. Further, infants of smoking mothers are 4 times more likely to developwheezing illnesses in the first year of life 51. In contrast, there is little evidence (based on meta-analysis) thatmaternal smoking during pregnancy has an effect onallergic sensitization 48. Thus, smoking during pregnancy has an impact on lung development, which increases thefrequency of nonallergic wheezing illnesses in infancy, buthas less impact on later allergic asthma. Overall, theseobservations are sufficient to make the very firmconclusion that environmental tobacco smoke exposureboth prenatally and postnatally has an adverse influenceon wheezing illnesses ( Evidence A). SECONDARY PREVENTION Once allergic sensitization has occurred, there areadditional opportunities to prevent the actual developmentof asthma. Two studies have suggested thatpharmacologic intervention with H1 antihistamines mayreduce the onset of wheezing in young children whopresent initially with atopic dermatitis 52,53. However, these studies need confirmation before it can be proposed thatthis class of compounds can prevent the onset of asthma.An older study found that allergen-specific immunotherapymay reduce the onset of asthma 54. The Preventive Allergy Treatment (PAT) Study is ongoing and the results will beimportant in addressing the preventive role ofimmunotherapy. Observations of occupational allergy suggest that early cessation of exposure to an offending allergen, after thereis evidence of sensitization and symptoms, is more likelyto lead to a total resolution of symptoms than if theexposure continues. TERTIARY PREVENTION Asthma exacerbations may be caused by a variety oftriggers including allergens, pollutants, foods, and drugs.Tertiary prevention aims to reduce the exposure to thesetriggers to improve the control of asthma and reducemedication needs. Avoidance of Indoor Allergens The occurrence and severity of asthma symptoms are related to environmental allergens 55. Thus, indoor environmental control measures to reduce exposure toallergens might be important, although it is difficult toachieve complete control, and there is conflicting evidenceabout whether such control measures are effective atreducing asthma symptoms 56,57. The majority of single interventions have failed to achieve a sufficient reductionin allergen load to lead to a clinical improvement. It islikely that no single intervention will achieve sufficientbenefits to be cost effective. However, properly poweredand designed studies of combined allergen-reductionstrategies in large groups of patients are urgentlyrequired 58. The effectiveness of allergen reduction in the treatment ofasthma was first suggested by studies in which patientswere removed from their homes to a low-allergenenvironment at high altitude 59,60. However, the real challenge is to create a low-allergen environment in COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEpatients' homes. Effective control strategies should be tailored to individual allergens, flexible to suit individual needs, and cost effective. Among the wide variety of allergens that occur within human dwellings are domestic mites, animal allergens(furred animals), cockroach allergen, and fungi. Domestic mites. The WHO has recognized domestic mite allergy as a universal health problem 61, although reducing mite populations is difficult. Methods to reduce the number of mites mainly have been used in developedcountries, and very little is known about the influence ofdifferent types of housing in developing countries on mitepopulations. However, the introduction of blankets hasbeen shown to increase the number of mites in homes dramatically and this was associated with the occurrenceof asthma in adults, but not in children 62. The most effective and probably most important avoidancemeasure is to use mattress, pillow, and duvet covers thatare impermeable to mite allergens 63,64(Evidence B). Other possible mite avoidance methods may be used, but theireffect on symptoms has not been adequately tested.Carpets are an important microhabitat for mite colonization,and a possible source for reinfestation of bedding. High levels of humidity are essential for mite population growth, and reducing humidity has been shown to be aneffective control method in some 65but not all66,67studies. Due to the aerodynamic characteristics of mite allergens, itmakes little sense to use air filtration units and ionizers asa way of reducing personal exposure. Since mites live in different sites throughout the house, it unlikely that a single measure can solve the problem ofexposure, and an integrated approach including barriermethods, dust removal, and removal of mite microhabitatsis needed (Figure 7-1). One such integrated approachwas recently shown to be highly effective in achieving andmaintaining a very-low-allergen environment in homes ofchildren at high risk of allergic disease 68. The clinical results are pending. Animal allergens. Furred, warm-blooded animals, including small rodents, produce dander, urine, and saliva that can cause allergic sensitization and subsequentreactions. Complete avoidance of pet allergens isimpossible, as the allergens are ubiquitous and can befound in many environments outside the home 69, including schools70, public transportation, and even cat-free buildings71. Removal of such animals from the home is important, but even after permanent removal of the animalit can be many months before reservoir allergen levelsdecrease 72. In patients who are allergic to cats or dogs and persist in keeping their pet, exposure-reductionmeasures listed in Figure 7-2 may be considered. However, the clinical effectiveness of these measuresremains unproven and there are many conflicting data onthis subject. Cockroach allergen. Cockroach infestation is an important cause of allergic sensitization, particularly in inner-city homes 82. Avoidance measures for cockroaches include eliminating suitable environments (restrictinghavens by caulking and sealing cracks in the plaster workand flooring, controlling dampness, and reducing theavailability of food), restricting access (sealing entrysources such as around paperwork and doors), chemicalcontrol (abamectin), and traps. However, these measuresare only partially effective 83. Fungi. The number of fungal spores can best be reduced by removing or cleaning mold-laden objects. Maintaining alow humidity (less than 50 percent) is important. Airconditioners and dehumidifiers reduce humidity and filterlarge fungal spores, lowering the mold and yeast countindoors, although their benefit in terms of reducing asthmasymptoms is controversial. In tropical and subtropicalclimates, fungi may grow on the walls of the house due towater seepage and humidity. To avoid this, the wallsFigure 7-1. Measures for Reducing Exposure to Domestic Dust Mite Allergens Encase mattress, pillow, and quilt in impermeable covers63,64. Wash all bedding in the hot cycle (55-60oC) weekly73.

Use a vacuum cleaner with integral HEPA filter and double-thickness bags81. 100 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEA SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 101could be tiled or cleaned as necessary. Avoidance of Outdoor Allergens Outdoor allergens such as pollens and molds are impossible to avoid completely. Exposure may be reducedby closing windows and doors, remaining indoors whenpollen and mold counts are highest, and using airconditioning if possible. Some countries use radio,television, and the Internet to provide information onoutdoor allergen levels. Knowledge of a patient 's sensitivity to specific allergens may be useful for givingadvice about the timing and location of the patient 's travel. Avoidance of Indoor Air Pollutants The most important measure is to avoid passive and active smoking. Passive smoking increases the risk of allergicsensitization in children 48,84. It also increases the frequency and severity of symptoms in children with asthma. Parentsof children with asthma should be advised not to smokeand not to allow smoking in rooms their children use. Ofcourse, all patients with asthma should be advised not tosmoke (Evidence B). The major indoor air pollutants are respirable particles, nitric oxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbondioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and biologicals suchas endotoxin 31. Preventing and controlling indoor air quality problems- except by cigarette smoke avoidance- can be expensive and time consuming, and the effectivenessof most control methods has not been adequatelyevaluated. The principal steps known to reduce exposureto respirable particles are avoiding cigarette and othertobacco smoke, venting all furnaces to the outdoors, andmaintaining heating systems adequately. To reduceexposure to nitric oxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbonmonoxide, all gas appliances should have sufficient fluesor ducts. Adequate ventilation will decrease carbondioxide concentration. Avoiding wood smoke, householdsprays, and volatile organic compounds (e.g., polishes andcooking oils) is also important ( Evidence D). Avoidance of Outdoor Air Pollutants Several studies have implicated various pollutants as aggravating asthma, mainly in controlled chamberexposure experiments. Most epidemiological studiesshow a significant association between air pollutants -such as ozone, nitrogen oxides, acidic aerosols, and particulatematter- and symptoms or exacerbations of asthma. On occasion, weather and atmospheric conditions create aperiod of intense air pollution in a defined geographic area.Useful steps to consider for patients with asthma duringsuch air pollution episodes include: Avoid unnecessary physical activity. Cold temperature and low humidity are additionally stressful to the patientwith asthma who exercises under conditions of high airpollution. Avoid smoking and smoke-filled rooms. Avoid exposure to dust and other irritants such as hair spray, paint, exhaust fumes, or smoke from any fire. Avoid exposure to persons with respiratory infections. Try to stay indoors in a clean environment. Air conditioning and other filters may be helpful. When it is necessary to go outdoors, it is recommended to take a rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator beforehand in order to prevent acute symptoms. If it appears that the air pollution episode will persist or worsen, it may be a good idea to leave the polluted areatemporarily. The health care professional and patient should formulate special plans to be followed with regard tomedication use. Avoidance of Occupational Exposure A large number of substances have been identified as occupational allergens and as risk factors that can causeasthma. Levels above which sensitization frequentlyoccurs have been proposed for many chemicals. However,once a patient has been sensitized, the level of exposurenecessary to induce symptoms may be extremely low, andresulting exacerbations may become increasingly severe.Attempts to reduce occupational exposure have beensuccessful especially in industrial settings, and somepotent sensitizers, such as soy castor bean, have beenreplaced by less allergenic or sensitizing substances.Prevention of latex allergy has been made possible by theproduction of hypoallergenic gloves, which are powder-free and have a lower allergen content 85,86. Although more expensive than untreated gloves, they are cost effective.The early identification of occupational sensitizers and theremoval of sensitized patients from any further exposureare important aspects of the management of occupationalasthma (Evidence B). Food AvoidanceFood allergy as an exacerbating factor for asthma is uncommon and occurs primarily in young children. Foodavoidance should preferably not be recommended beforea double-blind food challenge has been made. When theoutcome of such a challenge is positive, food allergenavoidance can reduce asthma exacerbations. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTESulfites (common food and drug preservatives found in such foods as processed potatoes, shrimp, dried fruits, beer,and wine) have often been implicated in causing severeasthma exacerbations and occasional deaths. They shouldbe avoided by sensitive patients. Proof for the involvementof other dietary substances, including the yellow dyetartrazine, benzoate, and monosodium glutamate, is difficultto ascertain, and their role in exacerbating asthma is pr obably minimal. Confirmation of their relevance requires double-blind challenge before making specific dietary restrictions. Avoidance of Certain DrugsSome medications can exacerbate asthma. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents can causesevere exacerbations and should be avoided in patientswith a history of reacting to these agents. Beta-blockerdrugs administered orally or by eye drops may exacerbatebronchospasm and in general, should not be used bypatients with asthma. If they are used, close medicalsupervision is essential. Avoidance of these drugsprevents exacerbations in susceptible patients. Vaccination Patients with moderate to severe asthma might be advised to receive an influenza vaccination every year 87. The purification of the vaccine preparations has made adversereactions to the vaccine less frequent. However, aCochrane collaboration review stated that there is notenough evidence to assess the benefits and risks ofinfluenza vaccination for people with asthma 88. 102 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAMPART 4A. ESTABLISH MEDICATION PLANS FOR LONG-TERM ASTHMA MANAGEMENT IN ADULTS KEY POINTS: Preferred treatment recommendations in this report are based on efficacy and safety outcomes in populations. The response of individual patientsmay, of course, differ significantly from the meanresponse of the population. Decisions abouttreatment are often a compromise between what the physician recommends and what the patient isprepared to take. Medications for asthma can be administered in different ways, including inhaled, oral (ingested), and parenteral (subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous). The major advantage of deliveringdrugs directly into the airways via inhalation is that high concentrations can be delivered moreeffectively to the airways, and systemic side effects are avoided or minimized. Although no cure for asthma has yet been found, it is reasonable to expect that in most patients with asthma, control of the disease can and should be achieved and maintained. Control of asthma can be achieved in many patients and can be defined as: Minimal (ideally no) chronic symptoms, including nocturnal symptoms Minimal (infrequent) exacerbations No emergency visits Minimal (ideally no) need for p.r.n. (as-needed) \u00df2-agonist No limitations on activities, including exercise PEF circadian variation of less than 20 percent (Near) normal PEF Minimal (or no) adverse effects from medicine. Therapy should be selected on the basis of the severity of a patient 's asthma, availability of anti- asthma medications, conditions of the health care system, and individual patient circumstances. For intermittent asthma , no daily medication is recommended for the vast majority of patients.Treatment of exacerbations should depend on the severity of the exacerbation. A rapid-actinginhaled /H92522-agonist may be taken as needed to relieve asthma symptoms. The occasional patientwith intermittent asthma, but severe exacerbations,should be treated as having moderate persistentasthma. Patients with mild persistent asthma require controller medication every day to achieve and maintain control of their asthma. Treatment with an inhaled glucocorticosteroid is preferred.Sustained-release theophylline, cromones, or aleukotriene modifier are other options. The preferred therapy for moderate persistent asthma is regular treatment with a combination of inhaled glucocorticosteroid and a long-acting inhaled/H92522-agonist twice daily. Sustained-release theophylline or a leukotriene modifier are alternatives to the /H92522-agonist in this combination therapy. An alternative to combination therapy is a higher dose of inhaledglucocorticosteroid. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEThis section focuses on general aspects of the pharmacological treatment of asthma and on the long-termmanagement of asthma in adults. A separate sectiondiscusses the management of asthma in children. THE MEDICATIONS Medications for asthma are used to reverse and preventsymptoms and airflow limitation and include controllersand relievers. Controllers are medications taken daily on a long-term basis that are useful in getting and keeping persistent asthma under control. Controllers have been variablylabeled as prophylactic, preventive, or maintenancemedications and include anti-inflammatory agents andlong-acting bronchodilators. Of all single medications,inhaled glucocorticosteroids are at present the mosteffective controllers. The so-called \"antiallergic \" agents may also be controllers, although there are insufficientdata about their efficacy in the long-term management ofasthma. It must be stressed that few clinical studies haveaddressed the question of how effective any of the anti-asthma medications are in getting asthma under completecontrol and in preventing symptoms and exacerbations. Most studies have examined the effect of medications on one or more of the parameters of asthma control, forexample, on reduction in the frequency of exacerbations,reduction in chronic symptoms, improvement in lungfunction, decreases in airway hyperresponsiveness, andimprovement in the patient' s quality of life. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids suppress airway inflammation, reduceairway hyperresponsiveness, and control and preventasthma symptoms 1,89-91. Bronchodilators act principally to dilate the airways by relaxing airway smooth muscle. Theyreverse and/or inhibit bronchoconstriction and relatedsymptoms of acute asthma, but do not reverse airwayinflammation or reduce airway hyperresponsiveness 92,93. Several long-term clinical studies have shown thattreatment with anti-inflammatory agents is more effectivethan treatment with bronchodilators for long-term control ofsymptoms, improvement of lung function, and decrease ofairway responsiveness 1,2,93-97. Relievers include rapid-acting bronchodilators that act to relieve bronchoconstriction and its accompanying acutesymptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness, and cough.Relievers have been variably labeled as quick-reliefmedicine or rescue medicine. This section presents an overview of the characteristics of different controller and reliever medications. Some clinicalstudies have shown a substantial heterogeneity inindividual patient responses to antiasthma medications 98. However, the concepts of \" responder\" and \" non- responder\" developed in these studies are very often based on a single outcome measure such as morning PEFor FEV1. Future developments in pharmacogenomics may result in asthma therapy that is more tailored to eachpatient' s response to specific medications 99. Further studies are needed before the current, empirical approach can bereplaced by treatment selected on the basis of specificgenotypes. Thus, the preferred treatment recommendationsin this section are based on efficacy and safety outcomesin populations. The response of an individual patient to agiven treatment may, of course, differ significantly from thepopulation mean. Decisions about treatment are often acompromise between what the physician recommends andwhat the patient is prepared to take. Route of AdministrationMedications for asthma can be administered via different ways, including inhaled, oral (ingested), and parenteral(subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous). The majoradvantage of delivering drugs directly into the airways viainhalation is that high concentrations can be deliveredmore effectively to the airways, and systemic side effectsare avoided or minimized. Some of the drugs that areeffective in asthma can only be used via inhalationbecause they are not absorbed when given orally (e.g., anticholinergics and cromones). The onset of action ofbronchodilators is substantially quicker when they aregiven via inhalation than when these drugs areadministered orally 100,101. Aerosolized medications that are used aerosols. Patients should be instructed A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 103 The primary therapy for severe persistent asthma includes inhaled glucocorticosteroid at higher doses plus a long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist twice daily. Alternatives to the long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist for add-on treatment are an oral sustained-release theophylline, leukotriene modifier, or oral /H92522-agonist. These drugs may also be added to the combination of high-doseinhaled glucocorticosteroid and long-acting inhaled/H92522-agonist if necessary. Once control of asthma is achieved and maintained for at least 3 months, a gradual reduction of themaintenance therapy should be tried in order to identify the minimum therapy required to maintaincontrol. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEin the use of the inhaler device, and their technique should be checked regularly. Inhaled asthma medications can begiven either singly or in combination inhalers, the latter ofwhich most often contain a glucocorticosteroid and abronchodilator. The disadvantage of pressurized MDI therapy is that training and skill are required to coordinate activation ofthe inhaler and the inhalation. The use of a spacer(holding chamber) improves drug delivery from an MDI(Evidence A) 102. The spacer device allows discharge of the drug into a chamber where particles of medications areheld in suspension for 10 to 30 seconds 103. During this time, the patient can inhale the drug. Spacers also reducedeposition in the mouth and oropharynx, decreasing coughas well as the possibility of oral candidiasis when used todeliver glucocorticosteroids ( Evidence A ). Further, the use of spacers for the delivery of inhaled glucocorticosteroidsdecreases their systemic bioavailability and the risk ofsystemic side effects 104(Evidence B). Some studies suggest that high doses of rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists administered from MDIs using spacer devices achievebronchodilatation to that effected by nebulizationin treating severe exacerbations wet-nebulizer deliveryof rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists in patients with severe acute exacerbations of asthma showed thesetwo delivery systems lead to equivalent clinical outcomesin adults but the MDI-plus-spacer system yields betterclinical outcomes in children 102(Evidence B). Breath- actuated aerosols may be helpful for patients who havedifficulty using the pressurized MDI 107. DPIs do not utilize freon propellants. They require aninhalation technique that is different from the MDItechnique, and are generally easier to use. A minimalinspiratory flow rate is necessary to inhale from a DPI, andthus the DPI may be difficult for some patients to useduring an exacerbation. The dosage should be adjusted toensure adequate drug delivery at the inspiratory flow ratethat patients can achieve. Some DPIs deliver pure drug,while others deliver the drug mixed with a filler (such aslactose), and thus the dosage should also take intoaccount the fact that different DPIs yield different drugdelivery to the lung. The dose of therapy may need to beadjusted when switching from an MDI to a DPI 108. DPIs are more ecological than MDIs because they do not utilizechlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), but storage of some drypowder formulations may be more difficult in humid climates. The CFCs in MDIs are now being replaced by hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs) 109. For bronchodilators the doses from CFC and HFA inhalers appear to beequivalent 109. However, for some glucocorticosteroids theHFA formulations, which deliver a greater fraction ofsmaller particles to the lung, may result in both greaterefficacy and greater systemic effects 110,111. Controller Medications Controller medications -medications used daily on a long- term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma- include inhaled glucocorticosteroids, therapies. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids areat present the most effective controller medications. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids. Mode of administration -Inhaled. Mechanisms of action -Several studies have demonstrated that treatment with inhaled glucocorticosteroids for 1 month or more significantlyreduces the pathological signs of airway inflammation inasthma 90-93,112. Airway hyperresponsiveness continues to improve with prolonged treatment2. Role in therapy -Glucocorticosteroids are currently the most effective anti-inflammatory medications for the treat-ment of asthma. Studies have demonstrated theirefficacy in improving lung function, decreasing airwayhyperresponsiveness 113, reducing symptoms, reducing frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improvingquality of life 1,89-91,114 (Evidence A). Inhaled glucocorticosteroids are the preferred treatment forpatients with persistent asthma at all levels of severity. Glucocorticosteroids differ in potency and bioavailability after inhalation, but relatively few studies have examinedthese differences. Dose comparison of glucocorticosteroidsis difficult due to their long time course of action and therelative flatness of their dose-response curves. Figure 7- 3lists approximately equipotent doses of different inhaled glucocorticosteroids administered via different inhalationdevices 20. A dose of 500 /H9262 g beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) or equivalent daily controls asthma in the majorityof patients. Because the dose-response curve of inhaledglucocorticosteroids is relatively flat for a number ofoutcome measures in asthma (e.g., symptoms, lung func-tion measurements, airway responsiveness), going to ahigh dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroid provides little further benefit in terms of asthma control but increasesthe risk of side effects 115. Add-on therapy with another class of controller is preferred over increasing the dose of 104 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEinhaled glucocorticosteroids ( Evidence A). There is, however, a clear relationship between the dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroids and the prevention of severeacute exacerbations of asthma 116. Therefore, some patients with severe asthma may benefit from long-termtreatment with higher doses of inhaledglucocorticosteroids, which allow the decrease orwithdrawal of oral glucocorticosteroids in t hese patients. The safety profile of higher doses of inhaledglucocorticosteroids is clearly better than that of oralglucocorticosteroids 117,118. Side effects -Local adverse effects from inhaled glucocor- ticosteroids include oropharyngeal candidiasis,dysphonia, and occasional coughing from upper airwayirritation, but these effects may often be prevented byusing spacer devices 119. Mouth washing (rinse with water, gargle, and spit out) after inhalation and the use ofa spacer may prevent oral candidiasis. All inhaled glucocorticosteroids currently available are absorbed from the lung, so there is inevitably somesystemic absorption. The risk of systemic adverseeffects from inhaled glucocorticosteroids depends on thedose and the potency of the glucocorticosteroid as wellas its bioavailability, absorption in the gut, first-passmetabolism in the liver, and the half-life of its systemicallyabsorbed (from lung and possibly gut) fraction 120. The systemic effects will therefore differ among the various in-haled glucocorticosteroids. Several comparative studieshave demonstrated that budesonide and have less systemic effect than BDP andtriamcinolone 89,120,121. The risk of systemic effects also depends on the delivery system; use of spacersdecreases the systemic bioavailability and the risk ofsystemic side effects for most glucocorticosteroids 122. Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that long-term treatment with high doses of inhaledglucocorticosteroids may be associated with systemiceffects, including skin thinning and easy bruising 123,124, adrenal suppression104,120, and decreased bone mineral density125,126. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids have also been associated with cataracts and glaucoma in cross-sectional studies 127,128, but there is no evidence of post- capsular cataracts in prospective studies129-131. The clinical significance of the adrenal suppression or thedecrease in osteoblast activity during treatment with highdoses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids is not yet known.One difficulty in establishing this clinical significance liesin dissociating the effect of high-dose inhaledglucocorticosteroids from the effect of courses of oralglucocorticosteroids taken by patients with severeasthma. There is no evidence that supports the use ofprophylactic treatment for osteoporosis in patients oninhaled glucocortiocosteroids. There are no data inmalnourished populations on the possible effects ofinhaled glucocorticosteroids on pulmonary tuberculosis or A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 105Figure 7-3. Estimated Equipotent Doses of Inhaled Glucocorticosteroids20 Adults Drug Low Dose Medium of appropriate dosing is the clinician 's judgment of the patient 's response to therapy. The clinician must monitor the patient' s response in terms of several clinical parameters and adjust the dose accordingly. The stepwise approach to therapy emphasizes that once control of asthma is achieved, the dose of medication should be carefully titrated to the minimum dose required to maintain control, thus reducing thepotential for adverse effects. Some dosages may be outside package labeling. Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) dosages are expressed as the amount of drug leaving the valve, not all of which is available to the patient. Dry powder inhaler (DPI) doses are expressed as the amount of drug in the inhaler following activation. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEon calcium metabolism and bone density. The influence of inhaled glucocorticosteroids on growth is discussed inChapter 7.4B, Establish Medication Plans for Long-TermAsthma Management in Infants and Children. Current evidence suggests that in adults systemic effects of inhaled glucocorticosteroids are not a problem atdoses of 500 /H9262g or less BDP or equivalent daily, but some patients may be susceptible to systemic effects at lowerdoses. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids are effectivecontrollers, and their use in the treatment of persistentasthma should be balanced against the possible risk ofsystemic effects. The risks of uncontrolled asthmashould be weighed against the (probably limited) risk ofthis form of treatment. Systemic glucocorticosteroids. Mode of administration -Oral (ingested) or parenteral. Mechanisms of action -The proposed mechanisms of action are the same as for inhaled glucocorticosteroids. However, systemic glucocorticosteroids may reachdifferent target cells than inhaled glucocorticosteroids. Role in therapy -Long-term oral glucocorticosteroid therapy (daily or alternate-day) may be required tocontrol severe persistent asthma, but its use is limited bythe risk of significant adverse effects. Note that thetherapeutic index (effect/side effect) of long-term inhaledglucocorticosteroids is always better than any form oflong-term oral or parenteral glucocorticosteroid therapy inasthma 117,118. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids more effective than alternate-day oral glucocorticosteroids117. If oral glucocorticosteroids have to be administered on along-term basis, then attention should be paid tomeasures that minimize the systemic side effects. Oralpreparations are preferred over parenteral for long-termtherapy. Oral glucocorticosteroids such as prednisone,prednisolone, or methylprednisolone preferredbecause of their minimal mineralocorticoid effect, theirrelatively short half-life, and their limited effects onstriated muscle. The short half-life allows their use on analternate-day schedule. Whenever possible, long-termtherapy with oral glucocorticosteroids should be givenonce in the morning every day or every other day 117,132. This generally allows sufficient control of the asthma andminimizes the systemic side effects. Some patients withvery severe asthma may need daily and even twice-dailytherapy with oral glucocorticosteroids. Side effects -The systemic side effects of long-term oral or parenteral glucocorticosteroid treatment includeosteoporosis, arterial hypertension, thinning leading tocutaneous striae and easy bruising, and muscleweakness. Patients with asthma who are on long-termsystemic glucocorticosteroids in any form should receivepreventive treatment for osteoporosis 133,134. Although it is rare, adrenal failure may occur when apatient is withdrawn from long-term suppressive doses oforal glucocorticosteroids. Any such withdrawal shouldthus be observed for clinical and laboratory evidence ofadrenal insufficiency. Withdrawal of oral glucocorticosteroidscan also unmask underlying disease, such as Churg-Strauss Syndrome 135. Caution and close medical supervision are recommendedwhen considering the use of systemic glucocorticosteroidsin patients with asthma who also have tuberculosis,parasitic infections, osteoporosis, glaucoma, diabetes,severe depression, or peptic ulcers. If radiological signsof healed pulmonary tuberculosis are present in a patientwho is taking long-term oral glucocorticosteroid therapyfor asthma, and the patient has never been treated witheffective antituberculosis drugs, then the patient shouldalso be given chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid. Fatal herpes virus infections have been reported among patients who are exposed to these viruses while takingsystemic glucocorticosteroids, even short bursts. If apatient is exposed to varicella, the following actions shouldbe considered: discontinue the systemic glucocorticosteroids,give the patient anti-zoster immunoglobulin, and consideracyclovir therapy if the patient develops progressivevaricella 136,137. Oral glucocorticosteroids also make patients more susceptible to herpes zoster infections, and thesame steps should be taken as for the generalizedvaricella if the patient develops the infection. Cromones: sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil sodium. Mode of administration-Inhaled. Mechanisms of action -The exact mechanisms of action of sodium cromoglycate and the related cromone nedocromil sodium are not fully understood, althoughthese nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications partlyinhibit the IgE-mediated mediator release from humanmast cells in a dose-dependent way, and they have acell-selective and mediator-selective suppressive effecton other inflammatory cells (macrophages, eosinophils,monocytes). There is some evidence that thesemedications inhibit a chloride channel on target cells 138. 106 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEThe long-term effects of sodium cromoglycate on the chronic inflammatory changes in patients with asthmahave not been directly demonstrated, except for one studyin which prolonged treatment with sodium cromoglycatewas associated with a significant decrease in the percentageof bronchial lavage eosinophils 139. No long-term effect of nedocromil sodium on the chronic inflammatory changesin asthma has yet been demonstrated 140. Role in therapy -Sodium cromoglycate or nedocromil sodium may be used as controller therapy in mildpersistent asthma. Administered prophylactically, thesemedications inhibit early- limitation and acute airflow limitation afterexposure to exercise, cold dry air, and sulfur dioxide.Sodium cromoglycate reduces symptoms and thefrequency of exacerbations 141, but studies have only inconsistently shown a benefit on nonspecific airwayhyperresponsiveness. In adult patients with asthma,clinical trials show that nedocromil sodium improvessymptoms and lung function, and reduces nonspecificairway responsiveness 142, although it is less effective than inhaled glucocorticosteroids143(Evidence B). There is insufficient knowledge about the mechanisms ofaction to predict which patients will benefit fromcromones; a 4- to 6-week therapeutic trial may berequired to determine efficacy in individual patients. Side effects -Sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil sodium produce only minimal side effects, such asoccasional coughing upon inhalation of the powderformulation. Some patients find the taste of nedocromilsodium unpleasant. Methylxanthines. Mode of administration -Oral (ingested). Mechanisms of action -Theophylline is a bronchodilator that may have extrapulmonary effects, including anti- inflammatory effects 144. The bronchodilator effect of theophylline may be related to phosphodiesteraseinhibition and is seen at high concentrations (>10 mg/l),whereas the anti-inflammatory effect is due to anunknown mechanism and may occur at lowerconcentrations (5-10 mg/l). At low doses theophyllinehas some minor influence on chronic airway inflammationin asthma 145,146. Most studies show little or no effect on airway hyperresponsiveness. Role in therapy -Sustained-release theophylline and aminophylline can be used as controller medications inasthma. Many clinical studies have shown that long-termtreatment with sustained-release theophylline is effectivein controlling asthma symptoms and improving lungfunction. When given as a sustained-releasepreparation, it has a long duration of action and is thususeful in the control of nocturnal symptoms that persistdespite the regular treatment with anti-inflammatorytherapy 147. Theophylline is also useful as an additional bronchodilator in patients with severe asthma148. Now that theophylline at low doses has been shown to beeffective in asthma control in both adults and children, itmay be used in patients with milder disease and as anadd-on therapy to low or high doses of inhaledglucocorticosteroids when further asthma control isneeded 149-153(Evidence B). As add-on therapy, theophylline is less effective than long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists 154,155(Evidence A). It is, however, a less expensive option. Due to the risk of adverse effects, and the difficulty of monitoring therapy (see discussion of side effects below),theophylline is regarded in some countries as a therapythat should be reserved for use after inhaledglucocorticosteroids and inhaled /H92522-agonists fail to achieve therapeutic goals. In other countries,theophylline is recommended earlier in the course ofdaily long-term therapy because it is a bronchodilatoruseful for the control of asthma, especially of nocturnalasthma symptoms, and it is inexpensive. Side effects -At higher doses (10 mg/kg body weight/day or more), theophylline has the potential for significantadverse effects, although these can generally be avoidedby appropriate dosing and monitoring. The signs andsymptoms of theophylline intoxication involve manydifferent organ systems. Gastrointestinal symptoms,nausea, and vomiting are the most common early events.However, theophylline intoxication in children and adultscan result in seizures and even death, and these eventsmay not be preceded by evidence of central nervoussystem stimulation. Cardiopulmonary effects includetachycardia, arrhythmias, and, occasionally, stimulationof the respiratory center. Generally, serious toxic effects do not occur at serum concentrations below 15 \u00b5g per ml. Individual patientneeds will vary, but a general approach to dosing andmonitoring is to aim for a steady-state serumconcentration for theophylline of between 5 and 15 \u00b5gper ml (28 to 85 \u00b5M) during long-term theophyllinetreatment. Monitoring of serum concentrations is advisedwhen high-dose theophylline therapy (10 mg/kg bodyweight/day or more) is started and at occasional intervalsthereafter. Monitoring is also advised when a patientdevelops an adverse effect on the usual dose, when A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 107 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEexpected therapeutic aims are not achieved, and when conditions known to alter theophylline metabolism exist(e.g., febrile illness, pregnancy, liver disease, congestiveheart failure, and the use of certain drugs, includingcimetidine, certain quinolones, and certain macrolides).Lower doses of theophylline are associated with lessfrequent side effects, and there is less need formeasurement of plasma levels in patients on low-dosetherapy (unless there are problems of side effects or lackof therapeutic effect). Long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists. Long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists, including formoterol and salmeterol, have a duration of action lasting more than 12 hours. (Most rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists have a 4- to 6-hour duration of action). Figure 7-4 compares the onset and duration of action of variousinhaled /H92522-agonists. Mode of administration -Inhaled. Mechanisms of action -Long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists are bronchodilator medications with activity that persists for at least 12 hours. Like other /H92522-agonists, they relax airway smooth muscle, enhance mucociliary clearance,decrease vascular permeability, and may modulatemediator release from mast cells and basophils 156,157. Biopsy studies show that the chronic airway inflammationin asthma is not increased by treatment with long-actinginhaled /H92522-agonists 92,158; in fact, a small anti-inflammatory effect has been reported with long-term use159,160. Therapy with long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists produces bronchodilation comparable to, or better than, oraltherapy. Long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists also provide long-term (>12 hours) protection againstbronchoconstrictor stimuli 161. Clinical pharmacology studies have shown that the duration of thebronchoprotective effect provided by long-acting inhaled/H92522-agonists decreases when these medications are used on a regular basis 162,163. The clinical significance of thesefindings is still unclear however, as long-term clinicalstudies do not indicate any decrease in efficacy overtime 182. Formoterol is a full agonist at the /H92522-receptor, while salmeterol is a partial agonist164, but the clinical significance of this difference is unclear. Role in therapy -Long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists should be considered when standard introductory doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids fail to achieve control ofasthma before raising the dose of inhaledglucocorticosteroids ( Evidence A). Because long-term treatment with long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists does not appear to influence the persistent inflammatory changesin asthma, this therapy should always be combined with inhaled glucocorticosteroids 96,97(Evidence A). Addition of long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists to a daily regimen of inhaled glucocorticosteroids improves symptom scores,decreases nocturnal asthma, improves lung function,decreases the use of rapid-acting /H92522- agonists 165-167, and reduces the number of exacerbations165-167,116,168(Evidence A). Several studies have now shown that adding a long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist (salmeterol or formoterol) in patients whose asthma is not controlled on either low orhigh doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids results inbetter control of asthma (in terms of lung function andsymptoms) than increasing the dose of inhaledglucocorticosteroids 2-fold or more 116,169,170(Evidence A). The greater efficacy of adding an inhaled long-acting /H92522-agonist to an inhaled glucocorticosteroid than increasing the dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroids hasled to the development of fixed combination inhalers(fluticasone propionate plus salmeterol, budesonide plus long-acting /H92522- agonists together in a combination inhaler is as effectiveas giving each drug separately 182-184(Evidence B). Fixed combination inhalers are more convenient for patients,may increase compliance, ensure that the long-acting /H92522-agonist is always accompanied by a glucocorticosteroid, and are usually less expensive than giving the two drugsseparately. Long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists may also be used to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm and may provide longer protection than rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists 162. Salmeterol and formoterol provide a similar duration of bronchodilation and protection againstbronchoconstrictors, but there are pharmacologicaldifferences between them. Formoterol has a more rapidonset of action than salmeterol 171,172, which may make formoterol suitable for symptom relief as well as symptom 108 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAMFigure 7-4.

Side effects -Therapy with long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists causes fewer systemic adverse effects- such as cardiovascular stimulation, skeletal muscle tremor, and hypokalemia- than oral therapy. There is no evidence that long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists worsen exacerbations of asthma or the chronic airway inflammation inasthma 116,173,174. Long-acting oral /H92522-agonists. Long acting oral of salbutamol or terbutaline and bambuterol,a prodrug that is converted to terbutaline in the body. Mode of administration -Oral (ingested). Mechanisms of action -Long-acting oral /H92522-agonists (sympathomimetics) are bronchodilators. Like other /H92522-agonists, they relax airway smooth muscle, enhance mucociliary clearance, decrease vascular permeability,and may modulate mediator release from mast cells andbasophils. Role in therapy -Long-acting oral /H92522-agonists may be helpful in controlling nocturnal symptoms of asthma.They may be used as an addition to inhaledglucocorticosteroids when standard doses do notsufficiently control nocturnal symptoms. Bambuterolappears to be as effective as salmeterol in controllingasthma in patients not controlled on low doses of inhaledglucocorticosteroids alone, although it may be associatedwith more frequent side effects 175,176. Side effects -Possible side effects include cardiovascular stimulation, anxiety, and skeletal muscle tremor. Adversecardiovascular reactions may also occur with thecombination of oral /H92522-agonists and theophylline. Leukotriene modifiers. Leukotriene modifiers (ingested). Mechanisms of action -5-lipoxygenase inhibitors block the synthesis of all leukotrienes. Leukotriene receptor antagonists block the CysLT1 receptors on airwaysmooth muscle and other cells and thus inhibit the effectsof cysteinyl leukotrienes that are released from mast cellsand eosinophils. These mechanisms result in a smallbronchodilator effect and reductions in allergen-, exercise-,and sulfur-dioxide-induced bronchoconstriction 177,178. There is also evidence for 179,180. Role in therapy -The role of leukotriene modifiers in asthma management remains under investigation.Clinical studies have demonstrated that leukotrienemodifiers have a small and variable bronchodilator effect,reduce symptoms, improve lung function, and reduceasthma exacerbations 177,178,181. The effect of leukotriene modifiers is less than that of low doses of inhaledglucocorticosteroids, and, in patients already on inhaledglucocorticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers cannotsubstitute for this treatment without risking the loss ofasthma control 182,183. There is evidence that leukotriene modifiers used as add-on therapy reduce the dose ofinhaled glucocorticosteroids required by patients withmoderate to severe asthma 184, and may improve asthma control in patients whose asthma is not controlled withlow or high doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids 183,185 (Evidence B). However, leukotriene modifiers are less effective than long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists as add-on therapy186(Evidence B). An advantage of leukotriene modifiers is their administration as a tablet. Somepatients with aspirin-sensitive asthma may respond wellto leukotriene modifiers 187. Side effects -Leukotriene modifiers are well tolerated, and few if any class-related effects have so far beenrecognized. Zileuton has been associated with livertoxicity, and monitoring of liver tests is recommendedduring treatment with this medication. There are severalreports of Churg-Strauss syndrome in association withleukotriene modifier therapy 135. In most but not all of these cases, the appearance of the Churg-Strausssyndrome was associated with a reduction in the dose ofsystemic glucocorticosteroids 188,189. The causal relationship between leukotriene syndrome is still unclear. Second-generation antihistamines Mode of administration -Oral (ingested). Mechanisms hasnot been clearly established, but they are recognized to have some inhibitory effects on the allergic response. A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 109 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE Role in therapy -Current evidence does not suggest a primary role for these agents in the treatment of asthma. They may have a small beneficial effect on ast hma in subjects with concurrent rhinitis190-192(Evidence B ). Side effects -The most frequent side effect of some second-generation antihistamines is still sedation,especially in the initial treatment period. Astemizole andterfenadine have been associated with severe cardiacside effects (torsade de point) and are therefore bestavoided. Ketotifen may also cause weight gain. Other oral antiallergic compounds. Among oral antiallergic compounds introduced in some countries for the treatment of mild to moderate allergicasthma are tranilast, repirinast, (ingested). Mechanisms of action -These compounds inhibit mast cell activation, interfere with the synthesis of allergic inflammatory mediators, or act as mediator antagonists. Role in therapy- Further studies on the relative efficacy of these compounds are needed before recommendationscan be made about the inclusion of these oral anti-allergic compounds in the long-term treatment of asthma.Their antiasthma effect appears to be limited 193. Side effects -Sedation is potentially a side effect; other serious side effects have not yet been reported for thisvery heterogeneous class of drugs. Systemic steroid-sparing therapies. Several types of treatment have been tested to reduce the requirement for oral glucocorticosteroids in patients withsevere asthma who experience significant side effectsfrom glucocorticosteroids 194. These steroid-sparing therapies include immunomodulators and some macrolides. Mode of administration -Oral (ingested). Role in therapy -Therapeutic regimens to reduce the dose of oral glucocorticosteroids required by patients with severe asthma may include such medications astroleandromycin, methotrexate 195-197, cyclosporin198, and gold199,200. These medications should be used only in selected patients under the supervision of an asthmaspecialist, as their potential steroid-sparing effect may not outweigh the risk of serious side effects. Two meta-analyses that considered the steroid-sparing effect oflow-dose methotrexate showed a small overall benefit,but a relatively high frequency of adverse effects 201,202 (Evidence B). Intravenous immunoglobulin has been shown to have some steroid-sparing effect in somecontrolled trials, but has been found ineffective inothers 203-205. This treatment is also very expensive and has a high frequency of adverse effects, so it cannot berecommended. Some macrolides have a small steroid-sparing effect when used with methylprednisolone,decreasing metabolism of the glucocorticosteroid 206,207. Side effects -Side effects vary with the medication but commonly include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.Less frequent but potentially severe adverse effectsinclude hepatitis and hematological, andpulmonary effects. Allergen-specific immunotherapy. Specific immunotherapy (SIT) using allergen extracts has been administered in many countries for the treatment ofallergic diseases, including asthma. The greatest benefitfrom this therapy has been obtained in the treatment ofallergic rhinitis. Mode of administration -Subcutaneous injection. Sublingual administration currently under assessment. Mechanisms of action -Although the mechanisms of action of SIT have not been fully defined, some studies suggest that SIT may shift the immune system 's balance from Th2 to Th1 cells, with increased production ofinterleukin (IL)-12 208,209. SIT also increases the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10210. Precisely how and under what circumstances thesechanges affect immune regulation of allergic inflammationis not fully ascertained. Role in therapy -The greatest benefit of SIT has occurred when administered to patients with allergic rhinitis that has been unresponsive to conventionalpharmacotherapy or specific environmental control or incircumstances in which patients do not wish to usemedications for prolonged periods of time. Severalstudies have demonstrated that SIT using extracts ofcommon aeroallergens may have some benefit in patientswith allergic asthma 211,212, but several large, well-conducted studies have not demonstrated such a benefit142,213. A Cochrane review214that examined 54 randomized controlled trials of SIT in asthma confirmed the efficacy ofthis therapy in asthma ( Evidence A). In particular, it emphasized the clinically useful outcomes of decreasedsymptom scores and medication requirements, as well asimproved allergen-specific and nonspecific airway 110 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEhyperresponsiveness. Importantly, the results of the Cochrane review were consistent and the number ofpatients studied was greater than 1,000, makinginterpretation of the meta-analysis valid. Despite this evidence, a number of questions remain to be addressedregarding the role of SIT in asthma therapy. First, whichindividuals are most likely to benefit? Second, is SITdirected at some aeroallergens more likely to be effectivethan that directed at other aeroallergens? Third, what isthe long-term effectiveness of SIT compared to otherforms of anti-inflammatory therapy? Finally, whichclinical outcomes are most likely to be affected by SIT? Because of these questions, and the relatively modesteffect of SIT in asthma especially compared to inhaledglucocorticosteroids, the possible benefits of this therapymust be measured in relation to the risk of adverse(occasionally fatal) effects and the inconvenience of theprolonged course of injection therapy, including a half-hour wait after each injection. Given the current state ofinformation, SIT should be considered only after strictenvironmental avoidance and pharmacologicintervention, including inhaled glucocorticosteroids, havefailed to control a patient' s asthma 215. There are no studies that compare SIT with pharmacologic therapy for asthma. Side effects -Local and systemic side effects may occur in conjunction with SIT administration. Reactionslocalized to the injection site may range from a minimalimmediate wheal and flare to a large, painful, delayedallergic response. Systemic effects may includeanaphylactic reactions, which may be life threatening, aswell as severe exacerbations of asthma. These systemicreactions are best treated with subcutaneouslyadministered epinephrine and other pharmacologic thera-pies 214. Deaths from SIT have occurred in patients with severe asthma. Therefore, every patient with severepersistent asthma receiving SIT should undergopulmonary function assessment prior to each SITadministration. Reliever Medications Reliever medications -medications that act quickly to relieve bronchoconstriction and its accompanying acute symptoms- include rapid-acting inhaled Rapid-acting salbutamol (albuterol), terbutaline,fenoterol, reproterol, and pirbuterol. Formoterol has both a rapid onset and a long duration of action. Mode of administration -Inhaled. Mechanisms of action -Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists (sympathomimetics) are bronchodilators. Like other /H92522- agonists, they relax airway smooth muscle, enhance mucociliary clearance, decrease vascular permeability,and may modulate mediator release from mast cells 156. Therapy with rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists is comparable to or better than oral therapy in producingbronchodilatation and avoiding side effects. The clinicalsignificance of /H92522-receptor polymorphisms requires further examination 216. Role in therapy -Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists are the medication of choice for treatment of acute exacer-bations of asthma and are useful for the pretreatment of exercise-induced asthma 217(Evidence A). Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists are used to control episodic bronchoconstriction. Use of rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists as required for symptom control is recommended andprovides a good indication of the need for further therapy.However, frequent or regularly scheduled use of rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists for long-term management of asthma does not adequately control asthma symptoms,peak flow variability, or airway hyperresponsiveness. Inone study, regularly scheduled (as opposed to as-needed)therapy with the /H92522-agonist fenoterol was associated with diminished control of asthma 218, but subsequent studies have shown no adverse effect of regular compared to as needed treatment with salbutamol in patients with mild tosevere asthma 109-111. In any case, regular treatment with rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists four times daily has largely been superseded by the use of long-actinginhaled /H92522-agonists. Increased use- or even daily use -of rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists is a warning of deterioration of asthma and indicates the need to institute or to intensify the regular anti-inflammatory therapy. Similarly, failure to achieve aquick and sustained response to /H92522-agonist treatment during an exacerbation mandates medical attention, andmay indicate the need for short-term treatment with oralglucocorticosteroids. As-needed use of formoterol, a /H92522-agonist with both a rapid onset and a long duration of effect, improves asthma control compared to as-needed use of the rapid- and short-acting /H92522-agonist terbutaline in patients with moderate asthma who are taking inhaled glucocortocosteroids 219. Formoterol has a well-documented role as controllertherapy in asthma, and further studies are needed toidentify its role as a reliever therapy. A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 111 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE Side effects -Therapy with rapid-acting inhaled /H92522- agonists causes fewer adverse systemic effects -such as cardiovascular stimulation, skeletal muscle tremor, and hypokalemia- than oral therapy. Systemic glucocorticosteroids. Mode of administration -Oral (ingested) or parenteral. Mechanisms of action -See the section on systemic glucocorticosteroids in \"Controller Medications \" above. Role in therapy -Although onset of action of these medications is 4 to 6 hours, they are important in the treatment of severe acute exacerbations because theyprevent progression of the asthma exacerbation, decrease the need for emergency department visits orhospitalizations, pr event early relapse after emergency treatment, and reduce the morbidity of the illness. Oraltherapy is preferred and is as effective as intravenous hydro-cortisone 220,221(Evidence B). Prednisone, prednisolone, and methyprednisolone are generallycontinued for 3 to 10 days following initial treatment of theexacerbation. A typical short course of oral glucocortico-steroids for an exacerbation is 30 mg prednisolone givendaily for 5 to 10 days depending on the severity of theexacerbation. When the symptoms have subsided andthe lung function has approached the personal best value,the oral glucocorticosteroids can be stopped or tapered,provided that treatment with inhaled glucocorticosteroidscontinues. Side effects -Potential adverse effects of high-dose short-term systemic therapy include reversible abnormalities in glucose metabolism, increased appetite,fluid retention, weight gain, rounding of the face, mood alteration, hypertension, peptic ulcer, and aseptic necrosisof the femur. These side effects are generally notobserved during a short course of oral or parenteral therapy. Anticholinergics. Mode of administration -Inhaled. effect of acetylcholine released from cholinergic nerves in the airways. When inhaled,these agents produce bronchodilation by reducing intrinsicvagal cholinergic tone to the airways. They also blockreflex bronchoconstriction caused by inhaled irritants.They do not diminish the early and late allergic reactionsand have no effect on airway inflammation. In asthma,inhaled anticholinergics are less potent bronchodilatorsthan inhaled /H92522-agonists, and in general, they have a slower onset of action (30 to 60 minutes to maximum effect). Role in therapy -Some reports show that ipratropium bromide has an additive effect when nebulized together with rapid-acting /H92522-agonist for exacerbations of asthma A meta-analysis of trials in which nebulized ipratropium bromide was added to a nebulized /H92522-agonist showed the anticholinergic produced a statisticallysignificant, albeit modest, improvement in pulmonaryfunction, and significantly reduced the risk of hospitaladmission 224(Evidence B). The benefits of ipratropium bromide in the long-term management of asthma havenot been established, although it is recognized as analternative bronchodilator for patients who experiencesuch adverse effects as tachycardia, andtremor from rapid-acting /H92522-agonists. Side effects -Inhalation of ipratropium or oxitropium can cause a dryness of the mouth and a bitter taste. There isno evidence for any adverse effects on mucus secretion 225. Methylxanthines. Mode of administration -Oral (ingested) or parenteral. Mechanisms of action -Theophylline is a bronchodilator that is, in general, less effective than an inhaled /H92522-agonist. Role in therapy -Short-acting theophylline may be considered for relief of symptoms (although its onset of action is considerably longer than that of a rapid-acting/H92522-agonist) 147(Evidence A). The role of theophylline/ Short-acting effect over adequate doses ofrapid-acting /H92522-agonists, but it may benefit respiratory drive or respiratory muscle function and prolong or sustainthe response to rapid-acting /H92522-agonist between doses. Side effects -As already noted, theophylline has the potential for significant adverse effects, although these can generally be avoided by appropriate dosing andmonitoring. Short-acting theophylline should not beadministered to treatmentwith sustained-release theophylline unless the serumconcentration of theophylline oral /H92522-agonists. Mode of administration -Oral (ingested). Mechanisms of action -Short-acting oral /H92522-agonists are bronchodilators that relax airway smooth muscle. 112 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE Role in therapy -Short-acting oral /H92522-agonists are appropriate for use in the few patients who are unable to use inhaled medication. Side effects -The potential for adverse side effects such as cardiovascular stimulation, skeletal muscle tremor,hypokalemia, and irritability is more significant with oraltherapy. Alternative and Complementary Methods of Healing Although alternative and complementary medicines may be popular with some patients, they have as yet beeninsufficiently researched, and their effectiveness is largelyunproven. However, their use merits consideration 226,227. The use of unconventional therapy is widespread, and it isassociated with considerable individual health careexpenditure 228. In some countries traditional methods of healing are a primary way of treatment; in many countries,there has been a move toward using various traditionalmethods of healing. The scientific basis of these modes oftherapy needs to be studied in detail, especially forcountries in which these forms of therapy are frequentlyused. These traditional therapies are not validated byconventional standards, and it is difficult to evaluatetraditional healing methods in randomized controlled trials.Furthermore, the psychotherapeutic benefit of a holisticapproach, a characteristic of many traditional andalternative systems of medicine, cannot be excluded. Although alternative and complementary healing methods cannot be recommended for asthma therapy until theyhave been studied more rigorously, the most widely knownmethods are described here. Acupuncture. The use of acupuncture originated over 2,000 years ago, and the technique was written up in detail soon thereafter. Traditional Chinese medicine is essentiallyholistic: The upset balance in disease is seen to be restoredby diet, lifestyle, acupuncture, and herbs. Acupuncture israrely used in this holistic way for the treatment of asthmain the West and in urban parts of China, where it is usedas a complementary medicine. This holistic approach isvery complex for investigation, and the available evidencepoints out that acupuncture per se is not indicated for the management of asthma 229. In a review of 13 trials on the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of patients withasthma, a score was established based on 18 predefinedmethodological criteria. The results showed that thequality of even the eight better studies was mediocre, andthe authors concluded that claims that acupuncture iseffective in the treatment of asthma are not based on theresults of well-performed clinical trials 230. Another systematic review found only seven acceptable trials, andeven in these the placebo was often inappropriate. In theacceptable trials, acupuncture did not produce a significantimprovement in asthma 229. Acupuncture is not entirely innocuous- acupuncture-associated hepatitis B, bilateral pneumothorax, and burns have all been described. Homeopathy. There is no evidence that homeopathy is effective in asthma. A systematic review, which found only three relevant trials of homeopathy in asthma, did not reachany conclusions about efficacy 231. Nevertheless, homeopathy is widely used, and in some countries is the only alternativemedicine accepted as part of government care. Morerigorous trials are necessary to assess the efficacy ofhomeopathy. Herbal medicine. Several modern treatments have their origins in the folk medicine tradition, including /H92522-agonists, anticholinergics, methylxanthines, and sodium cromoglycate, the last of which was developed from analogs of thenaturally occurring cromone khellin found in the WestAsian plant Amni visnaga . In different countries, several herbs are used in thetreatment of asthma, and herbal remedies are quitepopular for asthma and many other conditions. Since thebeginning of time, humans have been using plants forhealing. However, up to now, no controlled clinical trials ofherbal folk remedies have been reported. A public perception seems to be that because herbal remedies are \" natural\" they are safe. There are, however, no requirements on efficacy and safety for herbaltreatments. Some of these popular remedies could bepotentially dangerous, as exemplified by the occurrence ofhepatic veno-occlusive disease associated with theconsumption of the commercially available herb comfrey.Comfrey products are sold as herbal teas and herbal rootpowders, and their toxicity is due to the presence ofpyrrolizidine alkaloids. Ayurvedic medicine. \"Ayurveda\" is a Sanskrit word meaning knowledge of life. Ayurvedic medicine is a complex system of health care that has been practiced onthe Indian subcontinent for thousands of years 232. It consists of 20 separate components that include transcendentalmeditation, rasayanas (herbal preparations), pulsediagnosis, and yoga. The evidence that transcendentalmeditation may help in asthma is as yet poor anduncontrolled. The effect of one aspect of yoga breathingexercises, called pranayama, was well studied in a double-blind controlled trial that used a training and a placebodevice. After two weeks there was no difference betweenthe two groups regarding lung function, symptom score,and inhaler use 233. However, there was a small but A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 113 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEsignificant reduction in histamine reactivity in the group treated with pranayama breathing. The reason for thisimprovement is not clear. Ayurvedic medicine deservesattention in well-conducted clinical trials. Ionizers. Ionizers impart a negative charge to particles dispersed in room air, which are attracted to walls and floors that carry a positive charge. Controlled trials failedto show a significant benefit in patients with asthma fromthe use of ionizers 234. The negative ion generator in a room has several disadvantages, including production ofozone (a respiratory irritant). This therapy is notrecommended for asthma. Osteopathy and chiropractic manipulation. A controlled trial of chiropractic spinal manipulation showed no significant benefit of this therapy in asthma 235. Other manual therapies, including osteopathy and physiotherapy, have so far notbeen shown to be helpful in asthma management 236. The Alexander technique, consisting of a series of posturalexercises, has been claimed to be beneficial in asthmamanagement, but controlled trials have not been conducted 237. Speleotherapy. Treatment of asthma with periods in underground environments, including salt mines, has beenpopular in some regions, such as Eastern Europe.However, there are few controlled studies of this therapy,and no conclusions can be made about its benefits untiladequate controlled trials are conducted 238. Buteyko. Buteyko is a breathing technique consisting of a series of exercises in which subjects reduce the depth andthe frequency of respiration. It is practiced in Russia,Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. It isbased on theory that breath holding increases end-tidalCO2, producing bronchodilatation and even cure of the disease. A randomized controlled trial 239concluded that patients with asthma who practiced the Buteyko breathingtechnique reduced their alveolar ventilation (this findingwas especially prominent in patients who tended tohyperventilate) and their use of /H92522-agonists. There was a trend towards reduced glucocorticosteroid use, but noobjective change in measures of airway caliber. PracticingButeyko did not change end-tidal PaCO2values, so this is clearly not the mechanism of the technique 's small but probably real benefit to patients who tend to hyperventilateand to use excessive amounts of /H92522-agonists. Other methods. Reports of the effects of hypnosis and suggestion, naturopathy, behavioral therapy, and biofeed back on asthma are either scarce or contradictory. Clearly, morerigorous studies are warranted. It is strongly recommendedthat conventional treatment be continued if these treatments-or other traditional healing methods -are tried.A STEPWISE APPROACH TO PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY Although no cure for asthma has yet been found, it isreasonable to expect that in most patients with asthmacontrol of the disease can and should be achieved andmaintained. Control of asthma is defined as: Minimal (ideally no) chronic symptoms, including nocturnal symptoms Minimal (infrequent) exacerbations No emergency visits Minimal (ideally no) use of p.r.n. (as-needed) /H92522-agonist No limitations on activities, including exercise PEF circadian variation of less than 20 percent (Near) normal PEF Minimal (or no) adverse effects from medicine. Choice of TherapyThe selection of pharmacologic treatment options is made on the basis of asthma severity, the patient's currenttreatment, the pharmacological properties and availabilityof antiasthma treatment, and economic considerations.Because asthma is a dynamic as well as chronic condition,medication plans need to accommodate variability amongpatients as well as within individual patients over time. Anessential aspect of any treatment plan is the need formonitoring the effect of the treatment (including use ofmeasurements of lung function and symptoms) andadapting the treatment to the variability of the asthma. An approach to pharmacologic therapy that correlates with asthma severity permits this flexibility. As discussedpreviously, the classification of asthma severity shouldinclude symptom and medical history evaluation, currenttreatment, clinical examination, and measurements of lungfunction where possible. An appropriate approach to therapy recommends that the number (type), dose, and eventually the frequency ofmedications are increased with increasing asthmaseverity. The aim is to accomplish the goals of therapywith the least possible medication. Thus in developing anasthma management plan, the health care professionalmust judge whether to give maximum treatment at the 114 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEonset, which may include a burst or cycle of oral glucocorticosteroids and/or full doses of inhaledglucocorticosteroids plus long-acting /H92522-agonists (Evidence D) in order to achieve control of the patient' s asthma as quickly as possible, and then decrease themedication, or to start with treatment judged appropriatefor the severity of the patient 's asthma and increase treatment gradually if necessary. Once control issustained for about 3 months, a reduction in therapy to alower step can be carefully considered. This reduction intherapy is needed to identify the minimum therapy requiredto maintain control. Few studies have as yet investigated the efficacy of various comprehensive therapeutic programs inaccomplishing a broad set of therapeutic goals forcontrolling asthma. The recommendations that follow arethus based on an understanding of the pathology ofasthma and an extrapolation from controlled clinicaltherapeutic trials that have evaluated the effects ofparticular antiasthma therapies on separate outcomessuch as asthma symptoms, lung function, and the use ofbronchodilators on an as-needed basis to relieve symptoms. Figure 7-5 presents the stepwise approach to therapy to achieve and maintain control of asthma. The step system for classifying asthma severity takes into account thetreatment that the patient is currently receiving (Figure 5-7).Figure 7-5 presents all therapies that can be recommended for treating each step of asthma severity. Guidance forselecting among these available modalities is provided inthe text. The cost of the medication is an obvious factor indetermining the choice of treatment. Cost of treatmentvaries from country to country and is only one of the A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 115Figure 7-5. Recommended Medications by Level of Severity: Adults All Steps: In addition to regular daily controller therapy, rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist* should be taken as needed to relieve symptoms, but should not be taken more than 3 to 4 times a day. Level of Severity** Daily Controller Medications Other Treatment Options*** Step 1 None necessary Intermittent Asthma**** Step 2 Inhaled glucocorticosteroid Sustained-release theophylline, or Mild Persistent (500 \u00b5g BDP equivalent) Cromone, or Leukotriene modifier Step Inhaled oral /H92522-agonist, glucocorticosteroid at higher doses (> 1,000 \u00b5g BDP or equivalent), Inhaled glucocorticosteroid (500-1,000 equivalent) plusleukotriene modifier Step glucocorticosteroid Severe Persistent Asthma (> 1,000 \u00b5g BDP or equivalent) plus long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist, plus one or more of the Steps: Once control of asthma is achieved and maintained for at least 3 months, a gradual reduction of the maintenance therapy should be tried in order to identify the minimum therapy required to maintain control. * Other options for reliever medication are (in increasing order of cost) inhaled anticholinergic, short-acting oral /H92522-agonist, and short-acting theophylline. ** See Figure 5-6 and Figure 5-7 for classification of severity. *** Other treatment options listed in order of increasing cost. Relative medication costs may vary from country to country. **** Those with intermittent asthma but severe exacerbations should be treated as having moderate persistent asthma ( Evidence D). COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEfactors that contribute to the total cost of a disorder such as asthma. How To Achieve and Maintain Control of AsthmaThis section describes the therapy appropriate for different steps of asthma severity. The presence of one or morefeatures of clinical severity places a patient at therespective step (Figure 5-6). The current treatment shouldbe included in the assessment of severity ( Figure 5-7). In the stepwise approach to therapy, progression to thenext step is indicated when control is not achieved or islost with the current treatment, and there is assurance thepatient is using medication correctly. The frequent (e.g.,more than 3 times a week) presence of such symptoms ascough, wheezing, and dyspnea, and the increased use ofrapid-acting bronchodilators may indicate inadequatecontrol of asthma. The presence of symptoms at night orearly in the morning is an especially useful indicator.Measurement of PEF and its variability is helpful in theinitial assessment of asthma severity and in monitoring theinitial treatment, assessing changes in severity, andpreparing for a reduction in therapy. The treatments suggested for each step below are guidelines only; evidence levels assigned are basedon references provided in the previous text. Specific medication plans should be tailored by the health careprofessional depending on the availability of antiasthmamedication, the conditions of the health care system, andindividual patient circumstances. Repeated use of relievermedication more than 4 times a day indicates that thepatient' s asthma is not well controlled, and the intensity of treatment should be increased. Step 1-Intermittent Asthma. A patient has intermittent asthma if the patient experiences symptoms (episodes of cough, wheezing, or dyspnea) less than once a week overa period of at least 3 months, and the episodes are brief,generally lasting only a few hours to a few days. Nocturnalasthma symptoms do not occur more than 2 times amonth. In between exacerbations, the patient isasymptomatic and has completely normal lung function,i.e., a pretreatment baseline FEV1greater than 80 percent of predicted or PEF greater than 80 percent of personalbest, and PEF variability of less than 20 percent. Intermittent asthma includes the patient with allergy who is occasionally exposed to the allergen (e.g., cat or dog) thatis responsible for causing his or her asthma symptoms, butwho is completely symptom-free and has normal lungfunction when not exposed to the allergen. Intermittentasthma also includes the patient who has occasionalexercise-induced asthma (e.g., under bad weathercircumstances). Intermittent asthma is not trivial. The severity of the asthma exacerbation may vary from patient to patient andfrom time to time. Severe exacerbations are rare inpatients with intermittent asthma but can occur. The low frequency of the symptomatic episodes and the fact that in between exacerbations the patient hascompletely normal lung function support therecommendations that no long-term treatment with acontroller medication should be started. Further, patientcompliance with long-term therapy could be low when thepatient only experiences occasional symptoms. Rather,the exacerbations should be treated as such, dependingon their severity. Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist as needed is recommended for the majority of patients with mild intermittent asthma (Evidence A). People withintermittent asthma with severe exacerbations shouldbe treated as having moderate persistent asthma(Evidence D). Treatment includes medication prior to exercise as needed (rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist is the preferred treatment; a cromone or a leukotriene modifier are alternativechoices) (Evidence B) or upon allergen exposure (acromone is the preferred treatment) (Evidence B). Arapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist may be taken as needed to relieve asthma symptoms ( Evidence A). An inhaled anticholinergic, short-acting oral /H92522-agonist, or short-acting theophylline may be considered as alternatives to rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists, although these alternatives have a slower onset of action and/or a higher risk for sideeffects (Evidence A). Occasionally, more severe orprolonged exacerbations may require a short course oforal glucocorticosteroids. If medication is required more than once a week over a 3- month period, the patient should be considered to havemild persistent asthma. The same applies if the lungfunction between exacerbations becomes abnormal. Step 2-Mild Persistent Asthma. A patient has mild persistent asthma if he or she experiences symptoms and/or declines in lung function with sufficient frequency towarrant daily long-term therapy with controller medication.Mild persistent asthma is present if the patient experiencessymptoms at least once a week but less than once a dayover a 3-month period and some of the symptomaticepisodes affect sleep and activity levels; and/or if thepatient has chronic symptoms that require symptomatic 116 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEtreatment almost daily and experiences nocturnal asthma symptoms more than twice a month. The patient with mildpersistent asthma has a pretreatment baseline PEF ofmore than 80 percent of predicted or personal best andPEF variability of 20 to 30 percent. Furthermore, coughvariant asthma should be treated as mild persistentasthma. Patients with mild persistent asthma require controller medication every day to achieve and maintain controlof their asthma. The primary therapy for mild persistentasthma is regular use of anti-inflammatory medicationtaken on a daily basis. Treatment with an inhaledglucocorticosteroid is preferred (Evidence A). Thesuggested introductory dose of inhaled glucocortico-steroids is 200 to 500 /H9262g per day of BDP or budesonide, 100 to 250 /H9262g per day of fluticasone propionate (FP), or equivalent (Figure 7-3), divided over 1 or 2 dosings (Evidence B). Alternative controller medications (listed inorder of increasing cost) are sustained-releasetheophylline, cromones, and leukotriene modifiers, butthese are less effective than inhaled glucocorticosteroidsor are effective in only a portion of patients, who cannot beidentified without a treatment trial ( Evidence A). Long- term treatment with sustained-release theophylline may beconsidered, but the need for monitoring of serumtheophylline levels may make this treatment less feasible.Long-term trials that compare the effectiveness of these al-ternative controller medications in patients with mildpersistent asthma are needed. In addition to regular controller therapy, a rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist should be available to take as needed to relieve symptoms, but should not be taken more than 3 to 4 times a day. Other bronchodilator choices include an inhaled anticholinergic, short-actingoral /H92522-agonist, or sustained-release theophylline, although these have a slower onset of action and/or agreater risk of side effects. Because of the risk of seriousside effects, short-acting theophylline should not be usedas a reliever medication if the patient is already on long-term controller therapy with sustained-release theophylline.Use of reliever medication more than 4 times a dayindicates that the patient's asthma is not well controlled atthe current treatment level, and the patient should beconsidered to have a higher step of asthma severity. If the patient' s long-term therapy was initiated with sustained-release theophylline, a cromone, or a leukotriene modifier, and symptoms persist after 4 weeksof this initial treatment, then inhaled glucocorticosteroidsshould be introduced. The inhaled glucocorticosteroidsmay be initiated instead of the other medication, ortogether with it to allow an overlap period.Step 3-Moderate Persistent Asthma. Moderate persistent asthma is characterized by daily symptoms over a prolonged time or nocturnal asthma more than once aweek. A patient with a pretreatment baseline PEF of morethan 60 percent but less than 80 percent of predicted orpersonal best and PEF variability of 20 to 30 percent hasmoderate persistent asthma. If the patient 's asthma is not controlled on a low dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroids(Step 2), then the asthma should also be consideredmoderate persistent. Patients with moderate persistent asthma require controller medication every day to achieve and maintaincontrol of their asthma. The preferred controllertreatment for moderate persistent asthma is acombination of an inhaled glucocorticosteroid (200 to1000 \u00b5g of budesonide, to500 \u00b5g of fluticasone, or equivalent, divided over 2dosings per day), and a long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist twice daily (Evidence A). If a patient' s asthma is not con- trolled on a low dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroid (up to500 \u00b5g of beclomethasone or equivalent), then regulartreatment with a long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist should be added. If this is still not sufficient then the dose of inhaledglucocorticosteroid should be increased. A fixedcombination inhaler containing a glucocorticosteroid and along-acting /H92522-agonist is a convenient way to deliver this medication. Use of a spacer device to deliver the inhaledglucocorticosteroid is recommended to reduceoropharyngeal side effects and systemic absorption. Although combination therapy of glucocorticosteroid and a long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist is most effective and is the preferred option ( Evidence A), alternative add-on therapies include the following (in increasing order of cost): Sustained-release theophylline . This is a less expensive option, but is also less effective than a long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist. Serum theophylline concentrations should be monitored, with a general therapeutic range of5 to 15 /H9262 g per ml. Long-acting oral /H92522-agonist . This option may be as effective as a long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist, although the risk of side effects is greater. Leukotriene modifier . This option is less effective than a long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist. An alternative to this combination therapy is a higher dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroid, but adding another class ofcontroller drug is preferable to increasing the inhaledglucocorticosteroid dose. A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 117 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEIn addition to regular controller therapy, rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists should be available to take as needed to relieve symptoms, but should not be takenmore than 3 to 4 times a day. An inhaled anticholinergic, short-acting oral /H92522-agonist, or short-acting theophylline may be considered instead of the rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist, although these alternatives have a slower onset of action and/or a greater risk of side effects. Becauseof the risk of serious side effects, short-acting theophyllineshould not be used as a reliever medication if the patient isalready on long-term controller therapy with sustained-release theophylline. Step 4-Severe Persistent Asthma. Patients who have severe persistent asthma experience highly variable, continuous symptoms, and frequent nocturnal symptoms;have limited activities; and experience severe exacerbationsin spite of medication. A patient with a pretreatmentbaseline PEF of less than 60 percent of predicted or personalbest and PEF variability greater than 30 percent hassevere persistent asthma. Control of asthma as definedearlier may not be possible. In severe persistent asthma, the goal of therapy is to achieve the best possible results - the leastsymptoms, the least need for rapid-acting inhaled /H92522- agonist, the best PEF, the least circadian (night to day)variation, and the least side effects from medication. Therapy usually requires multiple daily controller medications. Primary therapy includes inhaledglucocorticosteroids at higher doses (> 1000 /H9262 g per day of BDP or equivalent) plus a long-acting inhaled/H92522-agonist twice daily (Evidence A). Better control may sometimes be achieved with 4-times-daily rather than twice-daily inhaled glucocorticosteroids 240,241 (Evidence A). A long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist is preferred as add-on treatment, but sustained-releasetheophylline, leukotriene modifier, or long-acting oral /H92522- agonist (Evidence B). These medications may also be added to the combination therapy (high-dose inhaledglucocorticosteroid plus long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist). A rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist should also be available for use as needed. If needed, long-term oralglucocorticosteroids should be used in the lowest possibledose, and are best given as a single morning dose in orderto minimize systemic side effects. When patients areswitched from oral glucocorticosteroids to high-doseinhaled glucocorticosteroids, they should be monitoredclosely for evidence of adrenal insufficiency. A nebulizer can deliver a higher dose of inhaled glucocortico- steroid (budesonide or FP), but there is little evidence thatthis results in fewer systemic effects than an equivalentdose of oral glucocorticosteroid 242,243. In addition, this treatment is relatively expensive and may produce localside effects, such as soreness of the mouth. There is noevidence yet from controlled trials to recommend the useof nebulized glucocorticosteroids in stable asthma in adults. Steroid-sparing therapies may be considered in patients with severe persistent asthma who have asthma that iscontrolled with oral glucocorticosteroids but whoexperience systemic side effects from this treatment(Evidence B). Such steroid-sparing therapies include methotrexate, cyclosporin A, and oral gold. Thesetreatments are poorly effective and have side effects thatare often more troublesome than those of steroids. Theyshould therefore only be used if there is clear evidence ofbenefit, and patients on these therapies must be monitoredcarefully. All patients who require such therapy should beunder the care of a specialist. Note that difficult-to-manageasthma may herald a life-threatening underlying disordersuch as Churg-Strauss syndrome or other forms ofsystemic vasculitis 181. The complexity of a multiple daily medication regimen isoften a factor in patient nonadherence, and this in turncomplicates control of asthma. Patients with severepersistent asthma may require particularly intensive patienteducation and referral to appropriate sources of support. Reduction of Maintenance (Controller) Therapy Asthma is a variable disorder, and spontaneous and therapy-induced variations in severity occur. Inhaledglucocorticosteroids reduce asthma severity over the longterm. Once control of asthma is achieved and maintainedfor at least 3 months, a gradual reduction of themaintenance therapy should be tried in order to identify theminimum therapy required to maintain control. This willhelp reduce the risk of side effects and enhance patientadherence to the treatment plan. The therapy reductionshould be done by gradually reducing the dose of inhaledglucocorticosteroids by approximately 25 percent every 3months or withdrawing the bronchodilator in subjects onlow doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids. That is,reduction of therapy should follow the reverse order ofwhat has just been described, with close monitoring ofsymptoms, clinical signs, and, as much as possible, lungfunction. Reduction of therapy in patients on combinationtherapy should begin with a reduction in the dose ofinhaled glucocortiocosteroid. Once the dose of theglucocortiocosteroid is at 500 /H9262g BDP or equivalent, then withdrawal of the add-on therapy may be considered(Evidence D). It is recommended that patients be reviewed at least every 3 months during the reductionphase. 118 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTESeasonal Asthma A patient has seasonal asthma when he or she has asthma symptoms due to seasonal exposure to allergen.This may be intermittent in patients who are otherwiseentirely asymptomatic with normal PEF values betweenseasons, or it may occur as a seasonal worsening ofpersistent asthma. The severity varies from patient topatient and from season to season. Treatment will vary accordingly but should follow the recommendations for thetreatment of persistent asthma. Ideally, treatment shouldstart just before the expected season or upon the firstsymptoms, and can be stopped at the end of the seasonwhen symptoms or lung function abnormalities are nolonger present (Evidence D). A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 119KEY POINTS: Childhood and adult asthma share the same underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. However, because of the processes of physical and cognitive growth and development, the effects,and adverse effects, of asthma and asthmatreatments in children differ from those in adults. Many asthma medications (e.g., glucocorticosteroids, /H92522-agonists, theophylline) are metabolized faster in children than in adults, and young children tend tometabolize drugs faster than older children. Therapy should be selected on the basis of the severity of asthma in the individual patient, theavailability of antiasthma medications, thecharacteristics of the health care system, and theindividual patient's social, family, and economiccircumstances. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids are at present the most effective controller medications and aretherefore recommended for persistent asthma at any step of severity. Long-term treatment withinhaled glucocorticosteroids markedly reduces the frequency and severity of exacerbations. Long-term treatment with inhaled glucocorti- costeroids has not been shown to be associated with any increase in osteoporosis or bone fracture.Studies including a total of over 3,500 childrentreated for mean periods of 1 to 13 years have found no sustained adverse effect of inhaledglucocorticosteroids on growth. Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists are the most effective reliever therapy in asthma, and this class of drugs has been the mainstay of asthmatreatment in children for many years. These drugsare the most effective bronchodilators available and are therefore the treatment of choice for acute asthma symptoms.PART 4B: ESTABLISH MEDICATION PLANS FOR LONG-TERM ASTHMA MANAGEMENT IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN Once control of asthma is achieved and maintained for at least 3 months, a gradual reduction of the maintenance therapy should be tried in order to identify the minimum therapyrequired to maintain control. Childhood and adult asthma share the same underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. However, because of the processes of physical and cognitive growth anddevelopment, the effects, and adverse effects, of asthmaand asthma treatments in children differ from those inadults. There are important age-related differences inanatomy, physiology, pathology, and drug metabolism, as well as effects from the unique social, emotional, anddevelopmental characteristics of childhood. Therefore, thediagnosis and management of asthma in children must beconsidered in its own right, and not merely extrapolatedfrom experience with adults. Because growth anddevelopment is a dynamic process, adverse effects maynot become evident immediately, but only at a later stageof maturation. Thus, long-term outcome studies areparticularly important to determine the possible effects ofasthma and its treatments during childhood on skeletal, behavioral, cognitive, sexual, and immune growth,development, and maturation. Children with asthma normally continue to grow until the age of 18. Within this childhood population it is convenientto make a distinction between adolescents (puberty-18 years), school children (6 years-puberty), preschoolchildren (1-6 years), and infants (< 1 year) , as there are clinically important differences between these age groupsin patterns of asthma symptoms, medication effects andside effects, and behavioral, cognitive, and socialdevelopment. However, it may sometimes be moreappropriate to collect data over broad age ranges andexamine the effect of age as a covariant. In this section,the role in therapy of various drugs is discussed separatelyfor each age group where such information is available. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE120 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAMIn developing a treatment plan, factors such as the severity of the individual patient's asthma, the benefits,risks, and availability of each treatment, culturalpreferences, and the characteristics of the health caresystem need to be considered. The final choice oftreatment should integrate the individual clinician'sexpertise with the patient's preferences and the bestavailable evidence from systematic, clinically relevantresearch in children. THE MEDICATIONS Medications for the management of pediatric asthmainclude both controllers and relievers. Controllers aremedications taken daily on a long-term basis to achieveand maintain control of asthma. Relievers act quickly torelieve bronchoconstriction and its accompanying acutesymptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness, and cough. Many asthma medications (e.g., glucocorticosteroids, /H92522-agonists, theophylline) are metabolized faster in children than in adults, and young children tend tometabolize drugs faster than older children. Although thisrapid metabolism to inactive drug is advantageous from asafety perspective, it also means that when medication isadministered orally, higher doses should be given to youngchildren than to adults or older children. In this section, asummary of pharmacokinetic information is providedwhere such information is available. Route of Administration Medications for asthma can be administered via different ways, including inhaled, oral (ingested), and parenteral(subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous). The majoradvantage of delivering drugs directly into the airways viainhalation is that high concentrations can be deliveredmore effectively to the airways, and systemic side effectsare avoided or minimized. Some of the drugs that areeffective in asthma can only be used via inhalationbecause they are not absorbed when given orally (e.g., anticholinergics and cromones). The onset of action ofbronchodilators is substantially quicker when they aregiven via inhalation than when these drugs areadministered orally 100,101. The choice of inhaler device should emphasize the efficacy of drug delivery, costeffectiveness, safety, and convenience 244. Information about lung dose for a particular drug formulation is seldom available for children. Differencesbetween devices do not alter the potential maximum effectof a given drug, but they do result in different potencies forthe same nominal dose of the drug given by differentinhalers. If these differences are disregarded, clinicallyimportant over- or undertreatment may be seen. Doserecommendations need to be evaluated depending on thedevice to be used. The choice of device for maintenance treatment should be related to the class of drug. The actual dose of /H92522-agonist administered by inhaler is often greater than necessary,but the potential side effects are minimal. Due to thegreater potential for side effects, however, inhaledglucocorticosteroids merit a more careful choice of deviceto ensure an optimal therapeutic effect with minimal sideeffects. The differences in first-pass metabolism ofdifferent inhaled glucocorticosteroids should also influencethe choice of device. A from a turbohaler. For maximum convenience, an inhaler device should be freely portable with no power requirement, and technicallysimple to operate with minimal maintenance requirements.Simplicity of operation is especially important in thetreatment of infants and preschool children, who are oftencared for by different people at different times of day (andnight). Cooperation and coordination required to use adevice should be minimal. Passive cooperation, such asthe acceptance of a face mask, can be expected frommost preschool children and even infants. Active cooperation,such as performing specific inhalation maneuvers andpriming or activating a device, can only be expected inolder children. For infants and preschool children, in whom active cooperation cannot be expected, a pressurized MDI usedwith a spacer and face mask is the device of choice formaintenance treatment. As cooperation improves, oftenaround the age of 4 to 6 years, the child should beencouraged to use a mouthpiece rather than a face maskto inhale from the spacer. From the age of 6, a dry powderinhaler (DPI) or breath-activated MDI is the device ofchoice (Figure 7-6) 244,245. Nebulizers are not preferred for maintenance treatment. Current nebulizers are expensive, bulky, time-consumingto use and care for, and require maintenance. Furthermore,a nebulizer provides imprecise drug delivery unlessequipped with a dosimeter. In infants and young childrenwhen even passive cooperation cannot be achieved, theloose face mask of a jet nebulizer is often more acceptablethan the close-fitting face mask of a spacer. However,parents should be advised of the advantages of the MDIwith spacer and encouraged to persevere with attempts atits use. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEDuring severe acute asthma, nebulizer treatment is preferred for all infants and most children. Often the childmay have a fever, or may be physically exhausted byrespiratory distress. This is not the ideal time to expectcompliance with treatment requiring active cooperation, norto promote the advantages of a closely fitted face maskwith spacer. For these children, high doses of drugs areused, and the imprecise drug delivery from a nebulizer is oflittle concern in the short-term. Controller /H92522-agonists. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids are at present the most effectivecontroller medications. The evidence on the effects ofketotifen in children is insufficient to warrant its use. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids.* Mode of administration -Inhaled. Pharmacokinetics -Most of the inhaled glucocorticosteroid deposited in the intrapulmonary airways is absorbed systemically; that deposited in theoropharynx is swallowed and absorbed from thegastrointestinal tract. A much higher proportion of theinhaled dose is deposited in the oropharynx, and a lowerproportion in the intrapulmonary airways, in childrencompared to adults 246. Children metabolize budesonide about 40 percent faster than adults247,248. The pharmacokinetics of other inhaled glucocorticosteroidshave not been studied in children. Role in therapy -Inhaled glucocorticosteroids are the most effective controller therapy, and are thereforerecommended treatment for persistent asthma at anystep of severity ( Evidence A). Dose-response studies and dose titration studies in children 249-252demonstrate marked and rapid clinical improvements in symptoms andlung function at low doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids(e.g., 100 /H9262 g budesonide daily) 250,253,254. However, the dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroid requiredto produce the maximum clinical effect depends onseveral factors: the outcome measure studied, theduration of administration of the inhaledglucocorticosteroid, the severity of the individual patient 's asthma, the drug/inhaler combination used, the age of thepatient, and the duration of asthma when treatment isinitiated. For example, in patients with mild disease, lowdoses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids offer full protectionagainst exercise-induced asthma 251, but children with more severe asthma may require four weeks' treatment with 400 /H9262 g/day budesonide to achieve a maximum protection against exercise-induced asthma. As aconsequence of all these factors, each patient may haveher/his own individual dose-response curve. This empha-sizes the importance of regular, individual tailoring of thedose. If this is done, the majority of patients with mild tomoderate asthma will be optimally controlled on 400 /H9262g or less of budesonide or equivalent daily. School children .

Symptom control and improvements in peak expiratory flow rate occur rapidly (after 1 to 2 weeks) at low doses(e.g., 100 /H9262 g/day), even in children with moderate to severe asthma 249-251,257, although longer treatment (1 to 3 months) with somewhat higher doses (e.g., 400 /H9262g/day) is required to achieve maximum improvement in airwayhyperresponsiveness as assessed by an exercisechallenge test 258-260. When inhaled glucocorticosteroid treatment is discontinued, there is usually a deteriorationof asthma control and airway hyperresponsiveness topretreatment levels within weeks to months, though insome patients the effect of the glucocorticosteroid ismaintained for much longer 261. When a child has already developed an exacerbation, a 4-fold increase in the daily dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroidor the introduction of oral glucocorticosteroid treatmenthave both been found to reduce the severity and durationof the exacerbation 262However, in one study a doubling of the inhaled glucocorticosteroid dose did notsignificantly modify exacerbations that had alreadydeveloped 263. Infants and preschool children . Randomized double- blind controlled trials of inhaled glucocorticosteroids inpreschool children with asthma have generally shownsignificant and clinically relevant improvements in healthoutcomes, including day- and nighttime symptom scoresfor cough, wheeze, and dyspnea, physical activity, use ofrescue treatment, and use of health care resources 264-269 (Evidence A). Lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness in wheezy children are also improved270. Although inhaled glucocorticosteroids typically reduce thenumber of asthma exacerbations in infants and preschoolchildren 266,268, they may not completely control the disease in some children. Whether this is due to insufficientpatient adherence, poor delivery of medication, insufficientdose of glucocorticosteroid, pharmacogenetic heterogeneity,or a distinct pathology in childhood asthma or in subgroupsof wheezy young children needs to be studied. The clinical benefits of systemic or inhaled glucocorticosteroids for viral-induced wheeze remaincontroversial. Some randomized double-blind controlledtrials found no short- or long-term clinical benefits from the administration of systemic 271-274or inhaled275-279 glucocortiosteroids during the acute phase of viral-induced wheeze in previously healthy infants, thoughsome short-term improvements have been reported inother studies 280,281. A Cochrane review concluded that episodic high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids provide apartially effective strategy for the treatment of mildepisodic viral-induced wheeze in children, but there is nocurrent evidence to support maintenance low-doseinhaled glucocorticosteroids for the prevention andmanagement of mild viral-induced wheeze 282. Side effects -The vast majority of studies evaluating the risk of systemic effects of inhaled glucocorticosteroidshave been undertaken in children older than 5. Clinicallyrelevant adverse effects should be studied in controlled,long-term clinical trials, using clinically relevant doses ingroups of patients with a disease severity and age similarto the groups in which the drugs would normally beprescribed. Bones . The only potential clinically relevant adverse effects of inhaled glucocorticosteroids on bones are osteoporosis and fracture. Biochemical markers of bonemetabolism (bone formation and degradation) and bonemineral density are the most commonly used surrogatemarkers for osteoporosis and risk of fracture in clinicaltrials. There have been no reports or studies showing anincreased incidence of fractures in children treated withinhaled glucocorticosteroids. Several cross-sectional andlongitudinal studies including a total of more than 700patients found no adverse effects of long-term inhaledglucocorticosteroid treatment (mean daily dose about 450/H9262g) on bone mineral density 113,283-290(Evidence A). Several short-term studies involving patients with mildasthma have reported that daily glucocorticosteroiddoses of 400 /H9262 g or less have no effect on bone metabolism, but high doses (800 /H9262g daily) lead to a reduction in both bone formation and degradation 283,291-295 (Evidence A). In adults the skeletal mass is decreasing over time, whilein children it is increasing, with peak bone mass anddensity reached in early adulthood. Thus, maximal peakbone mass or density is probably the most clinicallyrelevant outcome measure for assessing the influence ofglucocorticosteroids on bones in children. Severalconfounding factors must be considered when the effectsof glucocorticosteroids on bone metabolism in childrenare assessed. In children, the rate of bone modeling orturnover is much higher than in adults. Some chronicdiseases have been reported to be associated withreduced peak bone mass in children 283. Delayed puberty is also associated with a significantly lower peak bonemass/density 296,297, and delayed puberty is seen in many children with asthma and atopy, regardless of treatment.Other factors such as nutrition (including calcium intake), 122 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEheredity (both parents), poor asthma control, and level of physical activity appear to have profound effects on peakbone mass formation 298-306. Finally, children show a remarkable ability to repair glucocorticosteroid-inducedbone loss. In one study, children under 3 years old withsynacten-induced compression fractures of the spine hadnormal spinal x rays 5 to 10 years later 307. Such repair is not seen in adults. Growth . Important findings of studies on inhaled glucocorticosteroids and growth are summarized in Figure 7-7. Children with asthma treated with inhaledglucocorticosteroids have consistently been found to attain normal final adult height 308-310. Studies including a total of more than 3,500 children treated for mean periods of 1 to13 years found no sustained adverse effect of inhaledglucocorticosteroid treatment on growth 149,308,311-332. A meta-analysis of 21 studies including a total of 810patients compared attained height with expected heightof children with asthma treated with inhaled or oralglucocorticosteroids 333. Children treated with inhaled glucocorticosteroids attained normal height, while asignificant -though weak- retardation of growth was found in children receiving oral glucocorticosteroids. Furthermore,there was no statistical retardation evidence that inhaledglucocorticosteroid therapy was associated with growthretardation, even at high doses or with long-term therapy. However, inhaled glucocorticosteroid therapy can affect the growth rate of children with asthma, producing a retardation of growth when high doses are administered 113,331. This growth retardation occurs with all inhaled gluco-corticosteroids, although important differences seem toexist between the growth-retarding effects of variousinhaled glucocorticosteroids and inhaler devices 334-337. Children' s susceptibility to the growth-retarding effects of inhaled glucocorticosteroids also depends on their age;children 4 to 10 years old are more susceptible thanadolescents 308, 338. In addition, several studies have suggested that the systemic bioavailability and systemiceffects of an inhaled drug are more pronounced in patientswith mild asthma than in patients with more severedisease 339-341, probably due to differences in deposition pattern caused by a smaller airway diameter in moresevere disease. This means that a given dose of inhaledglucocorticosteroid may be more likely to adversely affectthe growth of a child with mild asthma than that of a childwith more severe disease. Growth retardation in both short- and medium-term studies of inhaled glucocorticosteroid treatment is dose dependent 337. No controlled studies have reported any statistically or clinically significant adverse effect ongrowth of inhaled glucocorticosteroid doses of 100 to 200 /H9262g per day 342,343. In addition, glucocorticosteroid- induced changes in growth rate during the first year oftreatment appear to be temporary and do not predictadult height 95,113,308. Knemometry, a method that captures short-term changes in linear growth of the lower leg, may be a valuableadjunct or alternative to traditional growth studiesbecause it facilitates controlled designs. Importantly,knemometry is not a measure of statural growth, but it isa very sensitive marker of systemic glucocorticosteroidactivity. Thus far, all placebo-controlled, double-blindknemometry studies assessing the effects of inhaledglucocorticosteroids on lower leg growth have beenundertaken in children with mild asthma who have notrequired continuous treatment 344-349. These studies show that, in both school children and preschool children, theeffect of inhaled glucocorticosteroids on lower leg growthrate is dose dependent. Low doses of inhaledglucocorticosteroid (200 /H9262g per day or less) are not associated with any detectable effects. As in staturalgrowth studies, growth inhibition dose-response curves inknemometry studies seem to differ between the glucocorticosteroids. A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 123Figure 7-7. Summary: Growth and Asthma No controlled studies have reported any statistically or clinically significant adverse effect on growth of 100 to 200 /H9262g per day of inhaled glucocorticosteroid342,343. Growth retardation may be seen with all inhaled glucocorticosteroids when a sufficiently high dose isadministered without any dose adjustment for diseaseseverity 113,331. Growth retardation in both short- and medium-term studies is dose dependent337. Important differences seem to exist between the growth-retarding effects of various inhaledglucocorticosteroids and inhalers 334-337. Different age groups seem to differ in susceptibility to the growth-retarding effects of inhaledglucocorticosteroids; children aged 4 to 10 are moresusceptible than adolescents 308,338. Children with asthma treated with inhaled glucocorticos- teroids have consistently been found to attain normalfinal adult height 308-310. Uncontrolled or severe asthma itself seems to adversely affect growth and final adult height308,310,315,356. Glucocorticosteroid-induced changes in growth rate during the first year of treatment appear to betemporary and do not predict adult height 95,113,308. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEWhen assessing the effects of inhaled glucocorticosteroids on growth in children with asthma, it is important toaccount for potential confounding factors. For example,many children with asthma experience a reduction ingrowth rate, most often toward the end of the first decadeof life 313,314,350-355. This reduced growth rate continues into the mid-teens and is associated with a delay in the onsetof puberty. The pre-pubertal deceleration of growth rateresembles growth retardation. However, the delay inpubertal growth is also associated with a delay in skeletalmaturation so that the child's bone age corresponds tohis or her height. Ultimately, adult height is notdecreased, although it is reached at a later than normalage 313,314,350-355. Studies also suggest that poorly controlled asthma may itself adversely affect growth308,312,315. In one study, a daily inhaled glucocorticosteroid dose of 400 /H9262g produced growth impairment, but this effect was smallerthan the effect of low socioeconomic status on growth ofchildren with severe asthma 356. Although the influence of inhaled glucocorticosteroids onthe growth of children with asthma has been studiedextensively in school children, more research isnecessary. Many studies conducted to date have haddesign flaws, and several have been retrospective oruncontrolled. Others have been conducted underconditions that are very different from the day-to-daytreatment situation. Moreover, few data are available onthe effect of inhaled glucocorticosteroid treatment ongrowth in infants and young children. These groups ' rapid growth rates and somewhat different metabolismdistinguish them from older children and may make theseyounger children more vulnerable to the adverse effectsof drugs and/or disease. Therefore, the findings on thesafety of inhaled glucocorticosteroids in school childrenor adults cannot be uncritically extrapolated to infantsand preschool children. Studies should be undertaken tospecifically address the effect of inhaled glucocorticosteroidson the rapid growth rates during the first 2 to 3 years oflife, which is mainly influenced by factors similar to thosecontrolling fetal growth, as well as growth from age 3onward, which is mainly controlled by the endocrinesystem, particularly growth hormone 357. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis . Adrenal suppression is the most extensively studied systemiceffect of inhaled glucocorticosteroids, and its occurrenceand m agnitude have been examined in detail. Though differences exist bet ween the various inhaled glucocorticosteroids and inhaler devices, treatment withinhaled glucocorticosteroid doses less than 400 /H9262g daily is normally not associated with any significant suppressionof the HPA axis in children 113,358,359. At higher doses, small changes in HPA-axis function can be detected with sensitive methods. The clinical relevance of thesefindings needs further study. Lung development . The observation that systemic glucocorticosteroids given during the first 2 weeks after birth (but not after this time) adversely affect alveolardevelopment in rats 360has raised fears that inhaled glucocorticosteroids may impair normal alveolardevelopment. However, there are no human data on this subject. Thus, in situations where inhaled glucocorticosteroidshave a definite positive clinical effect, concerns abouttheir possible adverse effects on lung growth should notbe a reason to withhold this treatment 361. More studies of inhaled glucocorticosteroids and lung development areneeded in infants. Cataracts . Studies evaluating the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts in more than 800 children receiving long-term (1 to 15 years) treatment with inhaledglucocorticosteroids have found that this treatment is notassociated with an increased occurrence of cataractdevelopment 113,129,131,362. Central nervous system effects . Published evidence of effects of inhaled glucocorticosteroids on the centralnervous system is limited to isolated case reports in atotal of 9 patients (3 adults and 6 children) 363-366who exhibited hyperactive behavior, aggressiveness, insomnia,uninhibited behavior, and impaired concentration with thistreatment. All patients returned to normal after theinhaled glucocorticosteroid was discontinued. Oral candidiasis . Clinical thrush is seldom a problem in children treated with inhaled or systemic glucocorticosteroids. The occurrence of this side effect seems to be related toconcomitant use of antibiotics, dose, dose frequency, andinhaler device. Spacers seem to reduce the incidence oforal candidiasis 367-370. Mouth rinsing has not been reported to be beneficial. In any case, oral candidiasis iseasily treated and rarely necessitates withdrawal ofinhaled glucocorticosteroid treatment. Dental side effects . There is no evidence that inhaled glucocorticosteroid treatment is associated with increased incidence of caries. However, an increasedlevel of dental erosion has been reported in children withasthma 371-373. This may be associated with a reduction in oral pH, which is mainly seen after inhalation of /H92522-agonists 374. Bruising and hoarseness . Although bruising and hoarseness have been reported to occur at increased fre-quency in adults treated with high doses of inhaledglucocorticosteroids, few studies have assessed the 124 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEoccurrence of these side effects in children. One study found that 178 children treated with inhaled budesonideat an average daily dose of about 500 /H9262g for 3 to 6 years did not have an increased occurrence of bruising,tendency to bruise, hoarseness, or other noticeable voicechange 129. Hoarseness is reversible after withdrawal of inhaled glucocorticosteroid treatment, but unlike thrush ittends to recur when the treatment is reintroduced.Spacers do not appear to protect against dysphonia. Other local side effects . There is no evidence of an increased incidence of lower respiratory tract infections, including tuberculosis, with chronic use of inhaledglucocorticosteroids. Although local skin changes aroundthe mouth may occur in children treated with nebulizedglucocorticosteroids inhaled through a face mask, thereis no evidence that a similar process occurs in theairways when glucocorticosteroids are inhaled. Systemic glucocorticosteroids. Mode of administration -Oral (ingested) or parenteral. Role in therapy -The use of oral glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of children with asthma is limited to acute exacerbations, whether viral-induced 280,375or otherwise376, 377. However, some studies have been unable to detect any effect of systemic glucocorticosteroidson exacerbations of asthma in children 378,379. There is no evidence that systemic glucocorticosteroids causereactivation of tuberculosis in children who have astrongly positive tuberculin reaction 380. Leukotriene modifiers. Leukotriene modifiers are a new class of anti-asthma drugs that include, for the treatment of asthma in children,the cysteinyl leukotriene zileuton has been approved in some countries foruse in adults, but is not available for children. Mode of administration -Oral. Role in therapy -Leukotriene receptor antagonists may be used as add-on treatment for moderate persistent and severe persistent asthma in children whose asthma isinsufficiently controlled by a low dose of inhaled glucocor-ticosteroids. Leukotriene receptor antagonists have not been studied as monotherapy in children with mildpersistent asthma so there are no data to support theiruse. However, moderate improvements in lung function(in children 6 and older) and in asthma control (in children2 and older) have been demonstrated with leukotrienereceptor antagonist monotherapy in patients with severedisease 381-383and in patients with moderate disease 384 (Evidence B). By extrapolation, this class of drug may be an alternative for monotherapy in some patients with mildpersistent disease ( Evidence D). Because the clinical effect of leukotriene modifiers begins a few hours to days after they are first administered,they are considered controller, not reliever, medications.Dose recommendations for children are based on pharm-acokinetic studies; the optimal dosing is therefore uncertain. Montelukast, approved for the treatment of asthma in children 2 years and older in some countries, isadministered once daily 385. The dosage (5 mg) yields a pharmacokinetic profile (single-dose area under theplasma concentration-time curve) in children comparableto that achieved with the 10-mg tablet in adults 386. There is no difference in bioavailability in children compared toadults, and food does not appear to have a clinicallyimportant influence on the bioavailability of thismedication. Zafirlukast, approved for treatment of asthma in children 7 years and older in some countries, is administeredtwice daily. One study supports the use of a 10-mg BID(twice-daily) dose for long-term treatment of mild tomoderate asthma in children 381. The bioavailability of zafirlukast is reduced by up to 40 percent when the drugis taken with food. Zafirlukast is metabolized by the liver, and therapeutic concentrations of the drug inhibit the hepatic cytochrome P450. This effect creates a risk ofdrug interactions. Transient elevations of liver enzymeshave also been reported 387,388. Pranlukast is approved for treatment in children 2 yearsor older in some countries. School children . Zafirlukast appears to be modestly effective in improving lung function and asthma control in children 12 years and older with moderate to severeasthma 389-391(Evidence A). Studies so far have failed to find a plateau of effects at the highest dose used, whichsuggests that hi gher doses may be more effective, although such doses are prohibited by the risk of sideeffects. In double-blind randomized controlled trials of children aged 6 to 14 with asthma 381,392, treatment with zafirlukast reduced nocturnal awakenings and provided20 to 30 percent protection against exercise-inducedbronchoconstriction 4 hours after the medication wastaken. Montelukast was compared to placebo in 336 children aged 6 to 14 with moderate to severe asthma 383. A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 125 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEApproximately one-third of the children in both groups received maintenance therapy with a constant dose ofinhaled glucocorticosteroids during the study. Theprimary outcome measure, FEV1, increased significantly, and the daily use of inhaled /H92522-agonists decreased significantly, in the children who took montelukastcompared to those who received the placebo. Montelukastappears to provide less protection against exercise-induced asthma than 400 /H9262 g budesonide per day 393. Preschool children . In a small study of children aged 3 to 5, cold-air hyperventilation caused only a 17 percentincrease in airway resistance after pretreatment withmontelukast, compared to a 47 percent increase afterplacebo pretreatment 394. This bronchoprotective effect seemed to be independent of concurrent steroid treatment.This result suggests that 4 mg montelukast providesclinically significant bronchoprotection in this age group. Cromones: sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil sodium. Mode of administration -Inhaled. Role in therapy -The role of sodium cromoglycate or nedocromil sodium in the long-term treatment of pediatric asthma is limited, particularly in preschool children. Aclinical trial in children indicated that nedocromil sodiumwas associated with less prednisone use and fewerurgent care visits, but by all other measures was nodifferent from placebo 113. School children . Sodium cromoglycate is less effective than inhaled glucocorticosteroids255,285,395-400with respect to symptoms, lung function, exercise-induced asthma, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Although some earlyplacebo-controlled clinical trials found that sodium cromo-glycate reduced symptoms, improved lung function, anda decreased the need for rescue bronchodilators 401-403, a meta-analysis of 22 controlled clinical trials concludedthat long-term treatment with sodium cromoglycate is notsignificantly better than placebo for management ofasthma in children 404(Evidence A). A Cochrane review concluded that nedocromil sodiumused before exercise appears to reduce the severity andduration of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction 405. A long-term placebo-controlled trial found a significant,albeit marginal, effect of nedocromil sodium (8 mg perday) on exacerbations, but all other outcome parameterswere unaffected 113. Preschool children and infants . The clinical documentation on the use of sodium cromoglycate in preschool childrenis sparse, and there are no reports on infants. Theavailable randomized double-blind controlled trials haveyielded conflicting results. Several studies have been unable to demonstrate any effect of 20 mg nebulizedsodium cromoglycate given 3 to 4 times daily on health outcomes 406-408or lung function409, while other studies have indicated that sodium cromoglycate has a significanteffect 410-412-of the same magnitude as theophylline413,414- on these parameters. Side effects -Cough, throat irritation, and bronchoconstriction are problems that occur in a smallproportion of patients treated with sodium cromoglycate,and the hypotonicity of the nebulized solution may causebronchoconstriction 415. A bad taste, headache, and nausea are the most common side effects of nedocromil350. Methylxanthines. The role of theophylline in the long-term treatment of children with asthma is limited, but the low cost of thistreatment may justify more frequent use in some countries. Mode of administration -Oral. Pharmacokinetics -Because children metabolize theophylline very rapidly, frequent dosing (4 to 6 times a day) is required when plain tablets are used for long-termtreatment. Therefore, sustained-release products arepreferable for maintenance therapy, and they enabletwice-daily dosing in most children. It is important to note that concomitant intake of food may change the absorption characteristics of many sustained-release theophylline products in an unpredictable way.Reduced absorption, dose dumping, and marked variationsin absorption profiles may be seen 416, complicating the task of ensuring safe, effective treatment. Because theeffect of concomitant food intake is quite unpredictable,only sustained-release products that have been shown tobe well absorbed in combination with food should beused for maintenance treatment. In this respect, it isimportant to evaluate both mean and individualabsorption profiles; the variation in absorption with foodseems to be more pronounced in children than inadults 416. Sustained-release theophylline products with reliable absorption profiles and complete bioavailabilitywith food have been developed 417. Dose-response studies with theophylline in a limitednumber of children with asthma have mainly assessedbronchodilation 418,419and protection against exercise- induced asthma420,421. Dose recommendations have been based on lean body weight and aim at plasma 126 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEtheophylline levels between 55 and 110 /H9262mol/l, which may be required to achieve maximum bronchodilatory effect in children with acute wheeze. However, there isstill considerable difference in opinion regarding theoptimum plasma levels that should be obtained. Studiesin adults and some studies in children suggest that lowerlevels may be sufficient to achieve a measurable effecton other outcomes in day-to-day management. Forexample, theophylline 's anti-inflammatory effects may be seen at about one-half of the plasma levels required formaximum bronchodilatory effect 20. Therefore, it seems rational to individualize the dose on the basis of theclinical effect rather than aiming at specific plasma levels,which are more useful in preventing intoxication. Atpresent, good studies of therapy with low-dosetheophylline in children are lacking. Within each age group in children, interindividual variations in theophylline half-life may be up to 10-fold.Other drugs may affect theophylline metabolism, such as/H92522-agonists (which increase clearance so that higher doses are required), as may viral infections (whichreduce clearance). Therefore, the theophylline dosemust always be individualized, and if high doses are usedplasma theophylline levels must be measured two hoursbefore administration of the next dose. When doseadjustments are made on the basis of serum theophyllineconcentrations, t heophylline often shows dose-dependent kinetics so that, on average, the percent change in serumconcentration is about 50 percent greater than thepercent change in dose 422. Role in therapy -Sustained-release theophylline may be used as an alternative to inhaled glucocorticosteroids formaintenance therapy in mild persistent asthma and asadd-on therapy with a low dose of inhaledglucocorticosteroids. School children . Theophylline is significantly more effective than placebo at controlling symptoms and improving lung function, even at doses below thenormally recommended therapeutic range 423-425(Evidence A). Furthermore, a single dose of 15 mg/kg of sustained- release theophylline taken before bedtime is effective atpreventing nocturnal asthma symptoms 425. Long-term maintenance treatment offers a marginal protective effectagainst exercise-induced asthma 420,426. Theophylline and oral /H92522-agonists seem to have an additive effect on control of asthma427,428, although it remains unclear whether the combination has any clear clinical advantagecompared to either drug used alone. Preschool children . There are indications that theophylline treatment has some beneficial clinicaleffects, such as bronchodilation, in this age group429,430 (Evidence C). However, further double-blind studies are needed to assess the optimal dose and preference of theophylline relative to other treatments in youngchildren. Infants . The effect of long-term theophylline treatment has not been assessed in double-blind controlled studies in infants with wheeze. Side effects -Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic window and potentially lethal side effects whenoverdosed 431-433. The most common side effects are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and headache431,432,434. Mild central nervous stimulation, palpitations, tachycardia,arrhythmias, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and, rarely, gastric bleeding may also occur. When maintenancetherapy with theophylline is begun, the initial dosageshould be low because side effects seem to occur muchmore frequently if the initial dose is high. Some patientsdo not tolerate theophylline, regardless of whatprecautions are taken. Theophylline has been reported to induce changes in mood and personality and to impair school performancein children 435,436, although these findings were not reproduced in another study437. Long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists. Mode of administration -Inhaled. Role in therapy -In children with asthma long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists are primarily used as add-on therapy in combination with inhaled glucocorticosteroids, eitheras maintenance treatment or as single-dose therapybefore vigorous exercise. Inhaled formoterol has a rapidonset of action (3 minutes) and a maximum effect at 30to 60 minutes after inhalation, much like the short-acting/H92522-agonist salbutamol 438,439. Inhaled salmeterol has a relatively slow onset of action, with a significant effectreported 10 to 20 minutes after inhalation of a single 50-/H9262 g dose 440, and an effect comparable to that of salbutamol after 30 minutes441. Because of its slow onset of action, salmeterol should not be used to treatacute asthma symptoms, including exercise-inducedbronchoconstriction, or to treat patients with rapidlydeteriorating asthma. Patients who take salmeterolshould also have a short-acting /H92522-agonist available at all times for the treatment of breakthrough symptoms. Although long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists may be useful in some children with asthma, in contrast to the situation with adults there is insufficient documentation of the A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 127 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEeffectiveness of these drugs to support a general recommendation for their use in children. Randomizeddouble-blind controlled trials of long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists as add-on treatment in children with poorly controlled asthma have so far yielded conflicting results 442-444. Most of these trials have shown a statistically significant, albeit small, improvement in lungfunction, but for other outcomes, such as symptoms andexacerbations, the effect of these drugs is marginal andless than that seen in adults. The recommended dose of formoterol for children (older than 6 years) is 4.5 /H9262g twice daily, although individual patient responses to the medication can vary considerablyand some patients may benefit from doses above theusual recommended level. The recommended dose of salmeterol for children (older than 4 years) is 50 /H9262g twice daily. Some children achieve full bronchoprotection formore than 12 hours after a single dose of inhaledsalmeterol or formot erol, although a considerable heterogeneity in the duration and magnitude of theresponse may be seen in different individuals 445. Side effects -Long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists are well tolerated in children, even after long-term use, with a side-effect pro file comparable to that of short-acting /H92522- agonists. Long-acting oral /H92522-agonists. Long of salbutamol or terbutaline and bambuterol,a prodrug that is converted to terbutaline in the body. Mode of administration -Oral (ingested). Mechanisms of action -Long-acting oral /H92522-agonists (sympathomimetics) are bronchodilators. Like other /H92522- agonists, they relax airway smooth muscle, enhance mucociliary clearance, decrease vascular permeability,and may modulate mediator release from mast cells andbasophils. Role in therapy -Long-acting oral /H92522-agonists may be helpful in controlling nocturnal symptoms of asthma.They may be used as an addition to inhaled glucocortico-steroids when standard doses do not sufficiently controlnocturnal symptoms 446,447. Side effects -Possible side effects include cardiovascular stimulation, anxiety, and skeletal muscle tremor. Adversecardiovascular reactions may also occur with thecombination of oral /H92522-agonists and theophylline.Reliever Medications /H92522-agonists. Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists have been the mainstay of asthma treatment in children for many years. These drugs are by far the most effective bronchodilatorsavailable and therefore the preferred treatment for acuteasthma (Evidence A). Mode of administration -Inhaled, oral, and intravenous. Role in therapy -Rapid-acting /H92522-agonists should preferably be given by inhalation since this allows bronchodilation to be achieved more rapidly, at a lowerdose, and with fewer side effects than occurs with eitheroral or intravenous administration 447,448. Furthermore, inhalation offers significant protection against exercise-induced asthma 449, which is not seen after systemic administration450. Generally quite low doses (25 percent of the normal dose in the inhaler) produce markedbronchodilation, while higher doses are required toprotect effectively against various challenges 258. Short-acting oral /H92522-agonists have low systemic absorption and a high first-pass metabolism in the wall ofthe gastrointestinal tract and in the liver. Thus, thesystemic bioavailability of these drugs after oral dosing isonly about 10 to 15 percent when plain tablets are used.This figure is around 30 percent lower after administrationof a slow-release product. Therefore, somewhat higherdoses should be used when /H92522-agonist therapy is changed from plain to slow-release tablets. Concomitantintake of food further reduces gastrointestinal bioavailabilityby about one-third 451. Clearance of /H92522-agonists is higher in children than in adults452,453. There is a significant correlation between plasma drug levels and bronchodilatory effect after systemic admin-istration of /H92522-agonists in children, although considerable inter-individual variations in this relationship exist 454,455. Therefore, effective therapy cannot be assured bystandardized dosing. Rather, dosing should be in-dividualized, with monitoring of the therapeutic responseand the occurrence of side effects to determine the properdose 453. A rational approach is to start oral treatment at around 0.15 mg/kg/day and then gradually increase thedose until a sufficient clinical effect or systemic sideeffects are seen. Oral doses of about 0.5 mg/kg/day areoften required to produce optimal clinical effects 450,455. School children . Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists have repeatedly proven superior to other drugs in thetreatment of acute episodes of wheeze 456,457(Evidence 128 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEA). Furthermore, premedication with a single dose of these drugs effectively inhibits exercise-induced asthma449,458. The normal duration of bronchodilation produced by a single dose of rapid-acting inhaled /H92522- agonist in children is 1 to 5 hours459, although the duration of action of these drugs depends upon the outcomemeasure assessed. For example, the duration ofprotection against exercise-induced asthma is markedlyshorter than the duration of bronchodilation 449. Maintenance treatment with a short-acting oral /H92522- agonist does not protect effectively against exercise- induced asthma450, though it improves symptoms and peak expiratory flow rates and protects against nocturnalasthma, particularly when a slow-release product isused 427,450. A combination of theophylline and short-acting oral /H92522-agonist has been found to be more effective than either drug used alone427, though it is not known whether the combination is preferable to single-drug therapy whenthe single drug is used in optimal doses. Preschool children and infants . Bronchodilation460-470 and bronchoprotection471,472with rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists have been demonstrated by objective measurements in preschool children. In infants, early studies failed to find any bronchodilator response tonebulized short-acting /H92522-agonist 376,473-475, which led to the belief that short-acting /H92522-agonists are ineffective in this age group. In these early studies, a fall in transcutaneousoxygen was interpreted as a lack of bronchodilatorresponse 476, although alternative explanations for this effect have since been presented, including acidity of thenebulizer solution 477and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Other studies have reported an increase in transcutaneousoxygen 478. Moreover, more recent double-blind placebo- controlled studies have demonstrated significantbronchodilation 460-465, protection against broncoconstrictor agents471,472, and clinical improvement in infants treated with rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist either alone or in combination with glucocorticosteroids280. The reason for these inconsistent results is not clear, although thevarious studies have differed with respect to dose, inhalerdevice (spacer, nebulizer), baseline lung function, durationof symptoms, and method of lung function measurement,and the inconsistencies are only seen in bronchodilatoreffects. All studies find that short-acting /H92522-agonists provide significant protection against bronchoconstrictioninduced by various challenges. Thus, it seems thatinfants have functional beta-adrenergic receptors frombirth, and that stimulation of these receptors can producethe same effects as in older children. Side effects -As in adults, skeletal muscle tremor, headache, palpitations, and some agitation are the mostcommon complaints in children when high doses of /H92522-agonists are used. After systemic administration of these drugs, these complaints seem to occur when thetop of the bronchodilatory dose-response curve isreached 454. Side effects seem to disappear with continued use of the medication479,480. Anticholinergic agents. Mode of administration -Inhaled. Pharmacokinetics -Virtually all pharmacokinetic data in children concern ipratropium bromide delivered with a nebulizer, although it would be expected that the optimaldose from an MDI would be lower 481. Various studies have found that increasing the dose above 250 /H9262g provides no extra bronchodilation482or protection against exercise-induced asthma483or cold air hyperventilation. No formal dose-response studies have been performedin infants, but a dose of 25 /H9262g/kg has produced beneficial effects in one study 461. The optimal frequency of dosing remains unknown. Role in therapy -Anticholinergics have a limited role in the management of asthma in children. School children . The bronchodilator response to ipratropium bromide seems to be quite variable in school children, but is always less than the response to aninhaled /H92522-agonist 484. Furthermore, there is no benefit from adding the drug to regular /H92522-agonist treatment for maintenance therapy485,486. Preschool children . As in school children, bronchodilation is seen in preschool children after inhalation of a singledose of ipratropium bromide 487,488. However, in one study regular treatment with ipratropium bromide (250 /H9262g 3 times a day) was no better than placebo in the control of asthmain preschool children, and a recent meta-analysisconcluded that the effect in children was marginal 488. Infants . A Cochrane review concluded that there is not enough evidence to support the uncritical use of anti-cholinergic agents for treatment of wheezing in infants,although patients using it at home were able to identifysome benefits 489. Side effects -Paradoxical bronchoconstriction after inhalation and dryness of the mouth may be a problem in some patients490,491. Some of these problems reported in the past seemed to be due to benzalkonium chloride,which has now been removed from the nebulizersolution. No other important side effects are associatedwith anticholinergic treatment. A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 129 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEAlternative and Complementary Methods of Healing See the section on management of asthma in adults. A STEPWISE APPROACH TO PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY The stepwise treatment paradigm emphasizes that asthma at any age, even from early childhood, is a disease in whichchronic airway inflammation underlies recurrent symptoms.Evidence suggests that any asthma more severe thanintermittent is more effectively controlled by interventionsthat suppress and reverse this inflammation than by thosethat only treat the episodic bronchoconstriction and relatedsymptoms. The selection of pharmacologic treatment options is made on the basis of an individual patient's asthmaseverity, the patient's current treatment, the pharm-acological properties and availability of various antiasthmatreatments, and economic considerations. Becauseasthma is a dynamic as well as a chronic condition,medication plans must accommodate variability among patients as well as the variability of an individual patient'sdisease over time. An essential aspect of any treatmentplan is monitoring of the effect of the treatment (includingmeasurements of lung function and symptoms) andadaptation of the treatment to the variability of the asthma. An approach to pharmacologic therapy in which treatment is correlated with asthma severity permits this flexibility.The classification of asthma severity should be made bymeans of evaluating the patient's symptoms, medicalhistory, and current treatment, a clinical examination, andmeasurements of lung function where possible ( Figure 5-6 andFigure 5-7). 130 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAMFigure 7-8. Recommended Medications by Level of Severity: Children All Steps: In addition to daily controller therapy, rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist* should be taken as needed to relieve symptoms, but should not be taken more than 3 to 4 times a day. Level of Severity** Daily Controller Medications Other Treatment Options*** Step 1 None necessary Intermittent Asthma**** Step 2 Inhaled glucocorticosteroid Sustained-release theophylline, or Mild or Leukotriene modifier Inhaled glucocorticosteroid Moderate Persistent (400-800 \u00b5g budesonide (< \u00b5g budesonide theophylline, or Inhaled budesonide or equivalent) pluslong-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist, or Inhaled glucocorticosteroid at higher doses (> 800 \u00b5g budesonide or equivalent), or Inhaled glucocorticosteroid (< 800 \u00b5g budesonide or equivalent)plusleukotriene modifier Step 4 Inhaled glucocorticosteroid Severe Asthma (> 800 \u00b5g budesonide or equivalent ) plusone or more Steps: Once control of asthma is achieved and maintained for at least 3 months, a gradual reduction of the maintenance the rapy should be tried in order to identify the minimum therapy required to maintain control. *Other options for reliever medication are (in increasing order of cost) inhaled anticholinergic, short-acting oral /H92522-agonist, and short-acting theophylline. **See Figure 5-7 for classification of severity. ***Other treatment options listed in order of increasing cost. Relative medication costs may vary from country to country. ****Children with intermittent asthma but severe exacerbations should be treated as having moderate persistent asthma ( Evidence D). COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEAn appropriate approach to asthma therapy recommends that the number (type), dose, and eventually frequency ofmedications be increased with increasing asthma severity.The aim is to accomplish the goals of therapy with the leastpossible medication. In developing an asthma managementplan, the health care professional must judge whether togive maximum treatment initially -which may involve a burst or cycle of oral glucocorticosteroids in order to achievecontrol of the patient's asthma as quickly as possible -and then decrease the medication, or to start with treatmentjudged appropriate for the severity of the patient 's asthma and increase the treatment gradually if necessary. Oncecontrol of asthma is sustained for 3 months, a reduction intherapy can be carefully considered. This reduction intherapy is needed to identify the minimum therapy requiredto maintain control. Figure 7-8 presents the stepwise approach to therapy to achieve and maintain control of asthma in children. The step system for classifying asthma severity takes into account thetreatment that the patient is currently receiving ( Figure 5-7 ). Figure 7-8 presents all therapies that can be recomm ended for treating each step of asthma severity. Guidance forselecting among these available modalities is provided inthe text. The cost of the medication is an obvious factor indetermining the choice of treatment. Cost of treatmentvaries from country to country and is only one of the factorsthat contribute to the total cost of a disorder such as asthma. How To Achieve and Maintain Control of AsthmaThis section describes the therapy appropriate for different steps of asthma severity. The presence of one or morefeatures of clinical severity places a patient at the respectivestep (Figure 5-6). The current treatment should beincluded in the assessment of severity ( Figure 5-7). In the stepwise approach to therapy, progression to the next step is indicated when control is not achieved or islost with the current treatment, and there is assurance thepatient is using medication correctly. The frequent (e.g.,more than 3 times a week) presence of such symptoms ascough, wheezing, and dyspnea, and the increased use ofrapid-acting bronchodilators, may indicate inadequatecontrol of asthma. The presence of symptoms at night orearly in the morning is an especially useful indicator.Measurement of PEF and its variability is helpful in theinitial assessment of asthma severity and in monitoring theinitial treatment, assessing changes in severity, andpreparing for a reduction in therapy. The treatments suggested for each step below are guidelines only; evidence levels assigned are basedon references provided in the previous text. Specificmedication plans should be tailored by the health careprofessional depending on the availability of antiasthmamedication, the conditions of the health care system, andindividual patient circumstances. Repeated use of relievermedication more than 4 times a day indicates that thepatient's asthma is not well controlled, and the intensity oftreatment should be increased. School children. Step 1- Intermittent Asthma . Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists may be used as reliever medications (Evidence A). However, in some cases \"as-needed\" treatment may be insufficient, such as in physically active children who do not normally exercise on a planned sched- ule. Regular controller treatment (particularly inhaledglucocorticosteroids) may be considered in such children(Evidence D). Step 2- Mild Persistent Asthma . Inhaled glucocorticosteroids (< 100-400 /H9262 g budesonide or equivalent per day) are recommended for maintenancetreatment (Evidence A). Alternative controller medications (listed according to increasing cost of the medication) aresustained-release theophylline ( Evidence C) and cromones (Evidence C). Monotherapy with drugs otherthan glucocorticosteroids leaves the underlying inflammatoryprocess in asthma less controlled. Studies of monotherapywith long-acting /H92522-agonists in children show some benefit but the results are inconsistent. Leukotriene modifiershave not been studied in children with mild persistentasthma; thus, there are no data to support their use.However, moderate effects have been demonstrated withleukotriene modifiers in patients with more severe disease,and by extrapolation this class of drug may also beconsidered an alternative controller therapy in some patients (Evidence D). Long-term trials that compare theeffectiveness of the various alternative controller medicationsin children with mild persistent asthma are needed. Step 3- Moderate Persistent Asthma . A higher dose (400-800 /H9262g budesonide or equivalent per day) of inhaled glucocorticosteroid should be used as controller medication (Evidence A). For children whohave frequent asthma symptoms despite regular treatmentwith less than 800 /H9262g inhaled glucocorticosteroid daily, a higher dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroid should beconsidered (Evidence D), but adding another class ofcontroller drug is preferable to increasing the inhaledglucocorticosteroid dose. Long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists are the most studied add-on medications ( Evidence B). Alternative add-on therapies include sustained-releasetheophylline ( Evidence B) and leukotriene modifiers (Evidence B). The response to these various medications A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 131 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEdiffers from patient to patient, and the choice of add-on therapy should be individually tailored. Long-term trialsthat compare the effectiveness of the various alternativeadd-on therapies in children with moderate persistentasthma are needed. Step 4- Severe Persistent Asthma . A higher dose (> 800 /H9262 g budesonide or equivalent per day) of inhaled glucocorticosteroid should be used as controller treatment (Evidence B). If the patient' s asthma remains uncontrolled, adding another class of controller drug shouldbe considered. Although a long-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist is the best-studied and preferred option for add-on therapy(Evidence B), alternatives theo- phylline (Evidence C) and leukotriene modifiers ( Evidence B). If long-term therapy with oral glucocorticosteroids is needed, these drugs should be used in the lowest possibledose (Evidence C), and are best given as a single morning dose in order to minimize systemic side effects. Whenpatients are transferred from oral glucocorticosteroids tohigh-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids, they should bemonitored for evidence of adrenal insufficiency. Again, thepatient' s response to the various treatment options should be observed, and the choice of treatment should beindividually tailored. Preschool children and infants. Although there are no well-conducted clinical trials to provide scientific evidencefor the proper treatment of asthma at each step of severityin these age groups, a treatment algorithm similar to thatused in school children is recommended for preschoolchildren and infants. Some adjustments must be made toaccount for the fact that in these younger children it isdifficult to predict the need for reliever medications. At thisage, children rarely communicate a need for relievertreatment, and caregivers are often unaware of the signalsto observe and are unfamiliar with the drug treatment. Theseconsiderations argue for early introduction of controllertreatment rather than reliance on \"as-needed\" rescue treatment. Preschool children and infants with wheezerepresent a more heterogeneous group than schoolchildren. Thus, the specificity of the asthma diagnosis inchildren under 3 is poor, and aerosol treatment maypresent an obstacle to regular treatment. Young children with asthma may be hospitalized with severe symptoms related to an upper airway infection.Courses of inhaled or oral glucocorticosteroids during suchinfections may reduce duration and severity of exacerbations,but there is no current evidence to support low-dosemaintenance therapy with inhaled glucocorticosteroids inchildren younger than 3. Reduction of Maintenance (Controller) Therapy Asthma is a variable disorder, and spontaneous and therapy-induced variations in its severity occur. Inhaledglucocorticosteroids reduce asthma severity over the longterm. Once control of asthma is achieved andmaintained for at least 3 months, a gradual reductionof the maintenance therapy should be tried in order toidentify the minimum therapy required to maintaincontrol. This will help reduce the risk of side effects and enhance patient adherence to the treatment plan.Reduction of therapy should include close monitoring ofsymptoms, clinical signs, and, as much as possible, lungfunction, and should follow the reverse order of what hasjust been described. In patients on combination therapythe reduction in therapy should begin with a reduction inthe dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroid by 25 percentevery 3 months. Once the dose of the glucocorticosteroidis at less than 800 /H9262g budesonide per day or equivalent, then the add-on therapy should be stopped ( Evidence D). It is recommended that patients be reviewed at least every3 months during the reduction phase. 132 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEExacerbations of asthma (asthma attacks) are episodes of rapidly progressive increase in shortness of breath, cough,wheezing, or chest tightness, or some combination ofthese symptoms. Respiratory distress is common.Exacerbations are characterized by decreases inexpiratory airflow that can be quantified by measurementof lung function (PEF or FEV1) 492. These measurements are more reliable indicators of the severity of airflowlimitation than is the degree of symptoms. The degree ofsymptoms may, however, be a more sensitive measure ofthe onset of an exacerbation because the increase insymptoms usually precedes the deterioration in peak flowrate 6. Still, a minority of patients perceive symptoms poorly3, and may have a significant decline in lung function without a significant change in symptoms. This situationespecially affects patients with near-fatal asthma and alsoappears to be more likely in males 4. The severity of asthma exacerbations may range from mildto life threatening. Deterioration usually progresses overhours or days, but may occasionally occur precipitouslyover some minutes. Acute exacerbations usually reflectexposure to a trigger, most often a viral infection or anallergen, but an exacerbation with a more gradual patternof deterioration may reflect failure of long-term management.Morbidity and mortality are most often associated withfailure to recognize the severity of the exacerbation,inadequate action at its onset, and undertreatment of it.Treatment of exacerbations depends on the patient,experience of the health care professional, therapies thatare most effective for the particular patient, availability ofmedications, and emergency facilities. The strategyoutlined below is best adapted and implemented at a locallevel 493so that its components have the maximal potential for successful utilization494. Many patients with moderate persistent to severe persistentasthma will have equipment and medications at home nec-essary for treating and monitoring an acute asthmaexacerbation. Local health care offices or dispensariesoften have therapies available to provide temporary reliefor amelioration of moderately severe exacerbations.Patients who live in rural settings may, by necessity, haveto manage an acute asthma exacerbation at home.Severe exacerbations are potentially life threatening, andtheir treatment requires close supervision. Thus, althoughlogistical limitations may exist, patients with severe exacer-bations should be encouraged to see their usual physicianpromptly or, if access is not immediately available, shouldproceed to the nearest hospital. In all settings thereshould be close objective (PEF) monitoring of theresponse to therapy to ensure that the patient is notdeteriorating and does not require augmented treatment. The primary therapies for exacerbations are the repetitive administration of rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist, the early introduction of systemic glucocorticosteroids, and oxygensupplementation 492. The aims of treatment are to relieve airflow obstruction and hypoxemia as quickly as possible,and to plan the prevention of future relapses. Crucial to successful treatment is close monitoring of the patient'scondition and response to treatment with serialmeasurements of lung function. Assessment of the patient's pulse, respiratory rate, and current symptomsalso guides treatment decisions, but measurements oflung function and oximetry are critical. Patients at high risk of asthma-related death require prompt care, particularly close monitoring, and intensivepatient education. These patients include those: With a history of near-fatal asthma requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, which puts patients at a 19-fold increased risk of needing intubation duringsubsequent exacerbations 495 Who have had a hospitalization or emergency care visit for asthma in the past year A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 133PART 5: ESTABLISH PLANS FOR MANAGING EXACERBATIONS KEY POINTS: Treatment of exacerbations depends on the patient, experience of the health care professional, therapies that are most effective for the particularpatient, availability of medications, and emergency facilities. Primary therapies for exacerbations are the repetitive administration of rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist, the early introduction of systemic glucocorticosteroids, and oxygen supplementation. Crucial to successful treatment of exacerbations is close monitoring of the patient 's condition and response to treatment with serial measurements of lung function.

The increased treatment should continue until measurements of lung function (PEFor FEV1) return close to normal, or the patient 's personal best. ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF THE EXACERBATION The severity of the exacerbation determines the treatment administered. Figure 7-9 provides a guide to the severity of an exacerbation of asthma at the time the examinationis made. Because these are guidelines only, all features in a category need not be present. A more severe gradingshould be given if the patient has a lack of response toinitial treatment, if the exacerbation has progressed quickly, or if the patient is at high risk for asthma-relateddeath. Indices of severity -particularly peak expiratory flow (PEF) (in patients over 5 years old), pulse, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry (in children) 499-should be monitored during treatment. Any deterioration may require prompt intervention. Pulse oximetry has beenshown to be particularly useful in pediatric acute asthma.Data also suggest that there are important differences inPEF patterns between periods of poor asthma control and exacerbations; in one study PEF fell during A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 135Figure 7-10.

HOME MANAGEMENT OF EXACERBATIONS Initiation of appropriate therapy at the earliest possible signs of deteriorating control of asthma is important in thesuccessful management of asthma exacerbations. Whenpatients are able to begin treatment at home, they not onlyavoid delays in treatment but also add to their sense ofcontrol over their asthma. The degree of care provided inthe home depends on the health care professional's andpatient's (or parents ') experience and the availability of medications and emergency care. Figure 7-10 illustrates the approach to home treatment that is discussed here. Home PEF measurements ideally should be an integral part of home management strategies, although the degreeof symptoms is a more sensitive detector of the earlystages of an asthma attack than is PEF 501. Ideally, all patients should have a written action plan with both asymptom and a peak flow component 501that outlines how and when to: Recognize signs of deterioration Modify or augment treatment Assess the severity of the attack Obtain more specialized care if appropriate. TreatmentBronchodilators. For moderate exacerbations, repeated administration of rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists (2 to 4 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour) is usually the best and most cost-effective method to achieve rapidreversal of airflow limitation. After the first hour, the doseof /H92522-agonist required will depend on the severity of the exacerbation. Mild exacerbations respond 2 to 4 puffsevery 3 to 4 hours; moderate exacerbations will require 6to 10 puffs every 1 or 2 hours; for more severe exacerbations,up to 10 puffs (preferably given with a spacer), or fulldoses given via nebulizer, may be required at less thanhourly intervals. Bronchodilator therapy delivered via ametered-dose inhaler (MDI), ideally with a spacer,produces at least an equivalent improvement in lungfunction as the same dose delivered via nebulizer 102,106. Depending upon the proportion of patients able to use anMDI, this route of delivery is also likely to be more costeffective 502. No additional medication is necessary if the rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist produces a complete response (PEF returns to greater than 80 percent ofpredicted or personal best) and the response lasts at least3 to 4 hours. Glucocorticosteroids. A number of studies indicate a benefit from action plans that integrate an increase in inhaled glucocorticosteroids early in an asthma exacerbation 501. The data to support the utility of this strategy are limited503. Oral glucocorticosteroids (0.5 to 1 mg/kg prednisolone orequivalent during a 24-hour period) should be used tospeed resolution of all but the mildest exacerbations. Auseful rough guide is to use oral glucocorticosteroids if theresponse to the rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist alone is not prompt or sustained (e.g., PEF greater than 80 percentof predicted or personal best) after 1 hour. Additional CareIf there is sustained improvement in PEF and symptoms, care may be continued at home under supervision. Full re-covery from the exacerbation is often gradual, and medicationsfor the exacerbation may need to be continued for severaldays to sustain relief of symptoms and improvement in PEF. There should be no delay in seeking medical help if: The patient is at a high risk for asthma-related death The exacerbation is severe (e.g., PEF remains less than 60 percent of predicted or personal best after /H92522-agonist therapy) The response to the bronchodilator is not prompt and sustained for at least 3 hours There is no improvement within 2 to 6 hours after glucocorticosteroid treatment is started There is further deterioration. HOSPITAL-BASED MANAGEMENT OF EXACERBATIONS Severe exacerbations of asthma are life-threatening medical emergencies. Care must be expeditious, andtreatment is often most safely undertaken in a hospital or ahospital-based emergency department. Figure 7-11 illustrates the approach to hospital-based management ofexacerbations that is discussed here. AssessmentA brief history and physical examination pertinent to the exacerbation should be conducted concurrently with the 136 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEA SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 137Figure 7-11. Hospital-Based Management of Asthma Exacerbations* Initial Assessment (see Figure 7-9) History (hx) physical examination (auscultation, use of accessory muscles, heart rate, respiratory rate, PEF or FEV1, oxygen saturation, arterial blood gas of patient in extremis, and other tests as indicated) Initial Treatment Inhaled rapid-acting /H9252 2-agonist, usually by nebulization, one dose every 20 minutes for 1 hour Oxygen to achieve O2saturation 90% (95% in children) Systemic glucocorticosteroids if no immediate response, or if patient recently took oral glucocorticosteroid, or if episode is severe Sedation is contraindicated in the treatment of exacerbations.

If inhaled /H92522-agonists are not available, consider intravenous aminophylline; see text.Improve Not Improve COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEprompt initiation of therapy. Laboratory studies should not be permitted to delay initiation of treatment. The brief history should include: severity of symptoms, including exercise limitation and sleep disturbance; allcurrent medication, including dose (and device) prescribed,dose usually taken, dose taken in response to thedeterioration, and the patient 's response (or lack thereof) to this therapy; time of onset and cause of the presentexacerbation; and risk factors for asthma-related death(see above), especially prior hospitalizations, intensivecare admission, and emergency department visits forasthma. The physical examination should assess the severity of the exacerbation (by evaluating the patient 's ability to complete a sentence, pulse rate, respiratory rate, pulsusparadoxicus- though this is a very imprecise sign in children- use of accessory muscles, and other signs detailed in Figure 7-11) and identify complications (e.g.,pneumonia, atelectasis, pneumothorax, saturation measurements. A baseline PEF or FEV1measurement should be made before treatment is initiated, if possible, without unduly delaying treatment.Subsequent measurements should be made at intervalsuntil a clear response to treatment has occurred. Oxygen saturation should be closely monitored, preferably by pulse oximetry. This is especially useful in childrenbecause objective measurements of lung function may be difficult and an oxygen saturation less than 92 percentis a good predictor of the need for hospitalization 499 (Evidence C). After initial treatment, a chest x ray and arterial blood gas measurements may be helpful in some patients. In adultsa chest x ray is not routinely required, but should becarried out if a complicating cardiopulmonary process issuspected, in patients requiring hospitalization, and inthose not responding to treatment where a pneumothoraxmay be difficult to diagnose clinically 504. Similarly, in children routine chest x rays are not recommended unlessthere are physical signs suggestive of parenchymaldisease 505(Evidence C). Arterial blood gas measurements are not routinelyrequired 506, but should be completed in patients with a PEF of 30 to 50 percent predicted and those who do notrespond to initial treatment. The patient should continueon supplemental oxygen while the measurement is made.A PaO2less than 60 mm Hg (8 kPa) and a normal orincreased PaCO2(especially greater than 45 mm Hg, 6 kPa) indicates the potential for or presence of respiratoryfailure. In these circumstances stabilization of the patientin a monitored area, and in the absence of improvementadmission to an intensive care unit for ongoing care, is recommended (Evidence D). Special considerations for infants and young children. Several differences in lung anatomy and physiology placeinfants at theoretically greater risk than older children forrespiratory failure. Despite this, respiratory failure is rarein infancy. Close monitoring, using a combination of theparameters listed in Figure 7-9 other than PEF, will permit a fairly accurate assessment. Breathlessness sufficientlysevere to prevent feeding is an important symptom ofimpending respiratory failure. Oxygen saturation, which should be measured in infants by pulse oximetry, is normally greater than 95 percent.Arterial or arterialized capillary blood gas measurementshould be considered in infants with oxygen saturation lessthan 90 percent on high-flow oxygen whose condition isdeteriorating. TreatmentThe following treatments are usually administered concurrently to achieve the most rapid resolution of theexacerbation 507. Oxygen. To achieve arterial oxygen saturation of greater than or equal to 90 percent (95 percent in children), oxygenshould be administered by nasal cannulae, by mask, orrarely by head box in some infants. Supplemental oxygenshould be administered to patients when arterial oxygenmonitoring is not available. One study suggests that PaCO2 may worsen in some patients on 100 percent oxygen,especially those with more severe airflow obstruction 508. These data need to be validated in a controlled trial, but for now suggest that oxygen therapy should be titratedaccording to oximetry ( Evidence D). Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists. Although inhaled /H92522-agonists are generally administered by nebulization, equivalent bronchodilatation with a more rapid onset, fewer side effects, and less time in theemergency department can be achieved using an MDI with a spacer 102,106(Evidence A). However, for some children, administration by nebulizer may be easier. If a jet nebulizer is used, it should be driven by oxygen insteadof air. Preliminary results indicate that if salbutamol isused, it may provide greater benefit if it is administered in isotonic magnesium sulfate than in normal saline 509 (Evidence B), although isotonic magnesium sulfate 138 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEcannot be routinely recommended until further studies are complete. Although therapy should ideally be given by theinhaled route, if inhaled medications are not available thenoral bronchodilators may be considered. Three randomized controlled trials 510,511,512have shown that during an exacerbation continuous treatment with inhaled therapy is more beneficial than intermittent treatment,especially for patients with more severe disease 513. Taken together, these trials suggest that continuoustreatment leads to greater increases in PEF and lowerhospital admission rates than intermittent treatment. In patients who do require hospitalization, one study 514 found that on-demand therapy led to a significantly shorterhospital stay, fewer nebulizations, and fewer palpitationswhen compared with regular therapy given every 4 hours.A reasonable approach to inhaled therapy inexacerbations, therefore, would be the initial use ofcontinuous therapy, followed by on-demand therapy forhospitalized patients. Intravenous /H92522-agonist may be added if there is no response to high-dose or continuous nebulized medication, although there are conflicting data about theutility of this treatment 515-517. Intravenous salbutamol or terbutaline should always be given in a monitored setting,as all studies show toxicity associated with the use ofthese medications. Epinephrine. A subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of epinephrine (adrenaline) may be indicated for acute treatment of anaphylaxis and angioedema. Epinephrinecan be used in the treatment of severe acute exacerbationsof asthma if /H92522-agonists (inhaled or parenteral) are not available. However, the possibility of adverse effects,particularly among hypoxic patients, is greater. Althoughepinephrine is sometimes considered if a severe acuteexacerbation is not responsive to rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist, a more logical approach, based upon the above data, would be to add an intravenous /H92522-agonist 507 (Evidence B). Additional bronchodilators. Ipratropium bromide) may produce better bronchodilation than either drug alone224(Evidence B), and should be administered before methylxanthines are considered. A number of studiesindicate that combination therapy is associated with lowerhospitalization rates 518-520(Evidence A) and greater improvement in PEF and FEV1519(Evidence B). Similar data have been reported in the pediatric literature520 (Evidence A).Methylxanthines . Methylxanthines have equivalent bronchodilator effect to inhaled /H92522-agonists, but because of increased side effects, methylxanthines should only be considered as an alternate therapy521. Systemic glucocorticosteroids. Systemic glucocorticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and should be considered integral to the management ofall but the mildest (see Figure 7-9) exacerbations 522, 523 (Evidence A), especially if: The initial rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist dose has failed to achieve lasting improvement The exacerbation developed even though the patient was already taking oral glucocorticosteroids Previous exacerbations required oral glucocorticosteroids. Systemic glucocorticosteroids administered by ingestionare usually as effective as those administered intravenouslyand are preferred because this route of delivery is lessinvasive and less expensive 220,524. If vomiting has occurred shortly after administration of the oral dose of glucocorticos-teroids, then a similar dose should be re-administered.Intravenous administration may be considered if intravenousaccess is desirable, or if there is possible impairment ofgastrointestinal absorption. In patients being discharged from the emergency department, intram uscular administration may be helpful 525, especially if there are concerns about compliance. Systemic glucocorticosteroids require at least 4 hours to produce clinical improvement. A meta-analysis hassuggested that doses of systemic glucocorticosteroidsequivalent to 60 to 80 mg methylprednisolone or 300 to400 mg hydrocortisone per day are adequate for hospitalizedpatients, and even 40 mg methylprednisolone or 200 mghydrocortisone is probably adequate 523, 526(Evidence B). There are no convincing data on the proper duration oforal prednisone treatment, although a 10- to 14-day coursein adults and a 3- to 5-day course in children is usuallyconsidered appropriate ( Evidence D). Current evidence suggests that there is no benefit to tapering the dose oforal prednisone either in the short term 221or over several weeks527(Evidence B). Inhaled glucocorticosteroids. The optimum increase in maintenance inhaled glucocorticosteroids to prevent anasthma exacerbation is not well defined. Previousguidelines have recommended doubling the dose ofinhaled glucocorticosteroids, but there is no evidence tosupport this recommendation. Higher doses (discussedbelow) may be appropriate. A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 139 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE140 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAMInhaled glucocorticosteroids are effective as part of combination therapy for asthma exacerbations that havealready developed. One study has shown that thecombination of high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids andsalbutamol in acute asthma provides greater bronchodilationthan salbutamol alone 528(Evidence B). In addition, inhaled glucocorticosteroids can be as effective as oralglucocorticosteroids at preventing relapses. Patientsdischarged from the emergency department on prednisoneand inhaled budesonide have a lower rate of relapse thanthose on prednisone alone 522(Evidence B). A high dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroids (2.4 mg budesonide daily in4 divided doses) achieves a relapse rate similar to 40 mgoral prednisone daily 529(Evidence A). Although cost is a major factor in using inhaled glucocorticosteroids as adjuncttherapy, these studies indicate that in patients intolerant ofor not willing to take oral prednisone, similar results can beachieved with very high doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids.Further studies are required to document the potentialbenefits of inhaled glucocortico-steroids in acute asthma 530. This is especially important given the cost effectiveness ofa short course of oral prednisone. Magnesium. Present evidence suggests that intravenous magnesium should not be used routinely in asthma exacerbations, but can help reduce hospital admissionrates in selected groups of patients: adults with FEV125 to 30 percent predicted at presentation; adults and childrenwho fail to respond to initial treatment; and children whoseFEV1fails to improve above 60 percent predicted after 1 hour of care 531,532(Evidence B). Intravenous magnesium is usually given as a single 2-g infusion over 20 minutes.No additional monitoring is required and there are noreported side effects. Helium oxygen therapy. Studies that have evaluated the effect of a combination of helium and oxygen, compared to oxygen alone, on airflow obstruction and dyspnea suggestthat this treatment should not be used routinely for mild tomoderate asthma 533, 534(Evidence D ), but should be reserved for patients with more severe disease535(Evidence B). Other treatments. Antibiotics are not routinely required unless there are signs of pneumonia or fever and purulent sputum suggesting bacterial infection, especially if bacterialsinusitis is suspected. Inhaled mucolytic drugs have not been shown to benefit treatment of exacerbations, and in severe exacerbationsthey may worsen cough or airflow limitation. Sedation should be strictly avoided during exacerbations of asthma because of the respiratory depressant effect ofanxiolytic and hypnotic drugs. Studies show anassociation between the use of these drugs andavoidable asthma deaths 498,536. Antihistamines and chest physical therapy have no established role in the treatment of exacerbations. Special considerations for infants and young children.Attention to fluid balance may be necessary for infants and young children, who may become dehydrated as aresult of increased respiratory rates and with decreasedoral intakes during an exacerbation. When treatmentsoffer similar profiles for efficacy and safety, noninvasiveprocedures are preferred in order to avoid pain andanxiety. Thus inhaled /H92522-agonist and oral glucocorticosteroid therapy are preferred to intravenous orsubcutaneous therapy, and pulse oximetry is preferred toarterial blood gas measurements. Criteria for Continuous MonitoringFactors indicating the need for close and continuous supervision that is provided either in a hospital ordispensary, depending on available facilities, include: Inadequate or deteriorating response to therapy within 1 to 2 hours of treatment Persisting severe airflow limitation (PEF less than 30 percent of predicted or personal best) Past history of severe asthma, particularly if hospitalization and admission to the ICU was required Presence of factors indicating high risk of asthma-related death (see above) Prolonged symptoms before the current emergency department visit Inadequate access at home to medical care and medications Difficult home conditions Difficulty obtaining transport to hospital in the event of further deterioration. Criteria for Discharge From Emergency Department versus Hospitalization Criteria for determining whether a patient should be discharged from the emergency department or hospitalizedhave been succinctly reviewed and stratified based onconsensus 537. Patients with a pretreatment FEV1or PEF below 25 percent of the predicted or personal best value,or those with a posttreatment FEV1or PEF below 40 percent of predicted or personal best, usually requirehospitalization. Patients with posttreatment lung function inthe range of 40 to 60 percent predicted can potentially COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEA SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 141be discharged, assuming adequate followup is available in the community and compliance is assured. Patients withobjective evidence of lung function 60 percent predicted orgreater can usually be discharged. Health care workersshould take account of the patient's prior adherencehistory and local pressure on inpatient access. Criteria for Admission to Intensive Care UnitAdmission to an intensive care unit, with consultation of an asthma specialist or a critical care specialist experiencedin treating asthma, is indicated if the patient has any of thefollowing: Severe asthma with a lack of response to initial therapy in the emergency department or worsening asthma despite adequate therapy Presence of confusion, drowsiness, other signs of impending respiratory arrest, or loss of consciousness Impending respiratory arrest: hypoxemia despite supplemental oxygen (PaO2less than 60 mm Hg (8 kPa) and/or PaCO2greater than 45 mm Hg (6 kPa), or SaO2 by oximetry 90 percent in children) (although respiratoryfailure may occur with either a high or low PaCO2). Intubation may be needed if there is continued deterioration in clinical features despite optimal therapy, if the patient isexhausted, and/or if the PaCO2is increasing. There are no absolute criteria for intubating a patient, but it should bedone by an experienced physician familiar with the drugsneeded and skilled in upper airway management. Rapid-sequence intubation, using succinylcholine and ketamine,is the preferred approach to intubation 538(Evidence D). Cohort studies have shown that controlled hypoventilationis the preferred method of ventilation 539,540(Evidence C), and that using this approach, the historically high rates ofcomplications previously seen with mechanical ventilationcan be avoided 541. If intravenous paralysis is used, there is the risk of the development of myopathy542(Evidence C). The duration of paralysis should be as brief as possible. The detailed management of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for acute asthma has been published543. In general, the principles of management for the ventilatedpatient are the same as those for the nonventilated patient: oxygenation, bromide, is best achieved by an inline deliverysystem using multiple puffs from an MDI. Failure torespond to this treatment should be an indication to useparenteral bronchodilator with close monitoring forarrthymias as outlined above. Given the documentedbenefit of magnesium sulfate, this should be infused earlyin the resuscitation phase. The usual dose is 2 g givenintravenously over 20 minutes. Patients should have atleast daily monitoring of metabolic parameters, especiallyserum potassium (Evidence D). Discharge From Emergency DepartmentAt discharge several actions are recommended: At minimum a 7 to 10 day course of prednisone for adults and a shorter course (3 to 5 days) for children should be prescribed with continuation of bronchodilator therapy. The dose of bronchodilator can be gradually reduced, based on both symptomatic and objective improvement,until the patient returns to his or her pre-exacerbation useof rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists. Ipratropium bromide is unlikely to give additive benefit beyond the acute phase and can be quickly discontinued. Patients should continue or initiate inhaled glucocorticosteroids. During the recovery phase patients should discontinue their long-acting /H92522-agonist until their asthma has been reassessed and stability has again been achieved. The patient' s inhaler technique and use of peak flow meter to monitor therapy at home should be reviewed.Patients discharged from the emergency department witha peak flow meter and action plan do better than patientsdischarged without these resources 544. The trigger factors that precipitated the exacerbation should be identified and avoided. The patient' s response to the exacerbation should be evaluated, and avoidable factors identified. Theaction plan should be reviewed and written guidanceprovided. Use of anti-inflammatory therapy during the exacerbation should be reviewed: whether this therapy was increased promptly, by how much, and, if appropriate, why systemicglucocorticosteroids were not added. Consider providinga short course of pr ednisone to be on hand for subsequent exacerbations. The patient or family should be instructed to contact the patient' s family primary health care professional or asthma specialist within 24 hours of discharge. A follow- up appointment with the patient 's family health care professional or asthma specialist should be made withina few days of discharge to assure that treatment iscontinued until best lung function is reached.Prospective data indicate that patients discharged fromthe emergency department for followup with specialistcare do better that patients returned to routine care 545. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEDischarge From Continuous Supervision There are no absolute criteria for discharge from hospitalization after an acute attack. However, patientsshould be on discharge medications for at least 12 hours(Evidence D), preferably 24 hours, before leaving supervision to assure that the patient's symptoms arecontrolled on the treatment he or she will take at home.Generally, the following criteria should be met whendischarge doses of oral and inhaled medications havebeen reached: Rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist is needed no more frequently than every 3 to 4 hours Oxygen saturation (by oximetry) is greater than 90 percent in air (or close to the patient 's optimal level) The patient is able to walk comfortably The patient is not waking at night or in the early morning and needing additional bronchodilator Clinical examination is normal or near normal PEF or FEV1is more than 70 percent of predicted or personal best after rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonist The patient is able to use inhaler devices correctly Followup and actions outlined above have all been taken. An exacerbation severe enough to require hospitalization may reflect a failure of the patient 's self-management plan. Hospitalized patients may be particularly receptive toinformation and advice about their illness; health careproviders should take the opportunity to review patientunderstanding of the causes of asthma exacerbations, thepurposes and correct uses of treatment, and the actions tobe taken to respond to worsening symptoms or peak flowvalues 546. Referral to an asthma specialist should be considered for patients with a history of life-threateningexacerbations or multiple hospitalizations. Following discharge from continuous supervision, the patient should be reviewed by the family health careprofessional or asthma specialist regularly over thesubsequent weeks until best lung function is reached.Plans for longer-term treatment, including adjustment ofthe overall treatment plan, should then be made. Patientswho come to the emergency department with an acuteexacerbation should be especially targeted for aneducation program, if one is available. 142 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAMPatients with asthma need regular supervision and support by a health care professional who is knowledgeable aboutthe condition. Continual monitoring is essential to assurethat therapeutic goals are met. While the patient is achieving control of asthma, frequent followup visits are necessary to review home PEF andsymptom records, the techniques in using medication,risk factors and methods to control them. Consultation with an asthma specialist is recommended under certain circumstances when: The patient has had a life-threatening asthma exacerbation, has poor self-management ability, or has difficult family dynamics Signs and symptoms are atypical or there are problems in differential diagnosis Clinical entities complicate asthma (e.g., sinusitis, nasal polyps, aspergillosis, severe rhinitis) Additional diagnostic testing is indicated (e.g., skin testing, rhinoscopy, complete pulmonary function studies, provocative studies) The patient is not responding optimally to the asthma therapy The patient requires Step 3 or 4 care (moderate persistent to severe persistent asthma) to control asthma The patient requires guidance on environmental control, consideration of immunotherapy, smoking cessation,complications of therapy, or difficult compliance issues. Once control is established, regular followup visits (at 1- to 6-month intervals as appropriate) continue to beessential. Health care professionals need to monitor andreview the treatment plans, the medications, the patient 's management techniques (e.g., for using medicines andpeak flow meters, for controlling the environment), and thelevel of asthma control (PEF and symptom reports). Themost appropriate method for followup will depend on thehealth care system. A patient visit to a primary health careor specialist office, an outreach worker visit to patienthomes, or followup for asthma that is integrated with a visit for another reason (well care, an acute illness otherthan asthma) can each be a suitable means for providingthe ongoing care essential for control of this chronicdisorder.PART 6: PROVIDE REGULAR FOLLOWUP CARE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTESpecial considerations are required in managing asthma in relation to pregnancy; surgery; PREGNANCY During pregnancy the severity of asthma often changesand patients may require close followup and adjustment of medications. Retrospective and prospective studieshave suggested that during pregnancy in approximatelyone-third of women asthma becomes worse; in one-thirdasthma becomes less severe; and in the other one-third itremains unchanged 547-549. Although concern exists with the use of medications inpregnancy, poorly controlled asthma can have an adverseeffect on the fetus, resulting in increased perinatalmortality, increased prematurity, and low birth weight 548,549. The overall perinatal prognosis for children born to womenwith well-managed asthma during pregnancy iscomparable to that for children born to women withoutasthma 550. For this reason, using medications to obtain optimal control of asthma is justified even when theirsafety in pregnancy has not been unequivocally proven.For most drugs used to treat asthma and rhinitis -with the exception of alpha-adrenergic compounds, brompheniramine,and epinephrine- there is little to suggest an increased risk to the fetus. Appropriately monitored theophylline, sodiumcromoglycate, inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate, andinhaled /H92522-agonists are not associated with an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities. Inhaled steroids havebeen shown to prevent exacerbations of asthma specificallyin pregnancy 551, 552(Evidence B). Acute exacerbations should be treated aggressively in order to avoid fetalhypoxia. Treatment should include nebulized rapid-acting/H92522-agonists and oxygen; systemic glucocorticosteroids should be instituted when necessary. As in other situations,the focus of asthma treatment must remain on control ofsymptoms and maintenance of normal lung function. All patients require adequate opportunity to discuss the safety of their medication, but this is especially importantfor women who plan to become pregnant and expectantmothers. Pregnant patients with asthma should be advisedthat the greater risk to their baby lies with poorly controlledasthma, and the safety of most modern asthma treatmentsshould be stressed. Even with a good patient/health careprofessional relationship, independent printed material willprovide important additional reassurance 547,553.SURGERY Airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, and mucus hypersecretion predispose patients with asthma tointraoperative and postoperative respiratory complications.The likelihood of these complications depends on manyfactors, including the severity of asthma at the time ofsurgery, the type of surgery (thoracic and upper abdominalpose the greatest risks), and the type of anesthesia(general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation carriesthe greatest risk). These variables need to be assessedprior to surgery by history, physical examination, andespecially measurement of pulmonary function. Ifpossible, this evaluation should be undertaken severaldays before the surgery to allow time for additional treatment.In particular, if FEV1values are less than 80 percent of the patient' s personal best, a brief course of glucocorticosteroids is required to reduce airflow limitation 554,555(Evidence C). Furthermore, patients who have received systemicglucocorticosteroids within the past 6 months should havesystemic coverage during the surgical period (i.e., 100 mghydrocortisone every 8 hours intravenously) and rapidly re-duced within 24 hours following surgery. Prolongedglucocorticosteroid therapy may inhibit wound healing 556 (Evidence C). PHYSICAL ACTIVITY For a majority of patients with asthma, physical activity isan important trigger of asthma exacerbations. For somepatients, it is the only trigger. This condition, in whichpostexertional airflow limitation resolves spontaneouslywithin 30 to 45 minutes following physical activity, isreferred to as exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Someforms of exercise, such as running, are more potenttriggers 557. EIA may occur in any climatic condition, but it increases substantially in breathing dry, cold air and is lesscommon in hot, humid climates 558. EIA is one expression of airway hyperresponsiveness, nota special form of asthma. EIA often indicates that thepatient's asthma is not properly controlled; therefore,appropriate anti-inflammatory therapy generally results inthe reduction of exercise-related symptoms. For thosepatients who still experience exercise-induced asthmadespite appropriate therapy and for those in whomexercise-induced asthma is the only manifestation ofasthma, the inhalation of rapid-acting /H92522-agonist before exercising is the most effective treatment for preventingasthma exacerbations. Many other compounds (sodiumcromoglycate, nedocromil, anticholinergic agents, A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 143SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO modifiers, and long-acting /H92522-agonists) have been demonstrated to modulate EIA. Training and sufficient warming up also reduce theincidence and severity of exercise-induced asthma 559,560. In people with asthma, physical training can improvecardiopulmonary fitness without changing lung function. Itis not known whether this improved fitness translates intoimproved quality of life 560(Evidence B). Because the treatment of EIA is so effective, there is noneed for patients to avoid physical activity. Instead, a goalof asthma management is to enable most patients toparticipate in any activity they choose without experiencingsymptoms. In addition, physical activity should be part ofthe therapeutic regimen of subjects with EIA. Physicaltraining decreases the ventilation necessary to maintain acertain level of activity; because the severity of EIAdepends on ventilation, a well-trained subject with EIAexperiences postexertional symptoms only at a higherdegree of physical activity than before training. Therefore, it is important to recommend that sports and physical activity should not be avoided in patients with EIA 560. RHINITIS, SINUSITIS, AND NASAL POLYPS Upper airway diseases can influence lower airway functionin some patients with asthma. Although the mechanismsassociated with this relationship have not yet been fullyestablished, recent studies have shown that inflammationplays a critical role in the pathogenesis of rhinitis, sinusitis,and nasal polyps, just as in asthma. RhinitisAsthma and rhinitis often coexist in the same patient 561. Common allergens such as house dust mites, animal danders, and, less commonly, pollen and aspirin or otherNSAIDs can affect both the nose and bronchi 562-564. Studies of the temporal relationship between the onset ofrhinitis and that of asthma have shown that rhinitisfrequently precedes the development of asthma 565. The majority of patients with asthma -75 percent of those with allergic asthma and over 80 percent of those with nonallergic asthma -present with symptoms of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis 561,566. Both asthma and rhinitis are considered to be inflammatory disorders of the airway, but there are somedifferences between the two conditions in terms ofmechanisms, clinical features, and treatment approach.Although the inflammation of the nasal and bronchialmucosa is sustained by a similar inflammatory infiltrate,including eosinophils, mast cells, and T lymphocytes, thereare differences in the mechanism of obstruction related tostructural differences between the nose and the bronchi 567. In rhinitis, nasal obstruction is largely due to hyperemia ofblood vessels, while in asthma reversible airwayobstruction is mostly due to airway smooth musclecontraction. In asthma airway mucosal inflammationcauses epithelial shedding, increased thickening of thereticular layer of the subepithelial basement membrane,and hypertrophy of the airway smooth muscle 568. In perennial rhinitis, the epithelium is usually not shed569. Treatment of rhinitis may improve asthma symptoms570 (Evidence agents including glucocorticosteroids, cromones, leukotriene modifiers, and anticholinergics are effective in both conditions. However,differences in treatment for the two conditions exist: somemedications are selectively effective against rhinitis (e.g.,/H9251-agonists) and others against asthma (e.g., /H9252-agonists). Others, such as the H1-antagonists, are more effective in rhinitis than asthma ( Evidence A) 571. Sinusitis Sinusitis is a complication of upper respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and other forms of nasalobstruction. Both acute and chronic sinusitis can provokeasthma. Diagnosis of sinusitis requires either X-ray or CT scan confirmation; clinical findings of sinusitisare often too subtle to make the diagnosis 572. Antibiotic therapy of sinusitis has been associated with short- tomedium-term improvement in symptoms. Such therapy ismore likely to be effective if the antibiotics are given for atleast 10 days 573(Evidence B). Treatment should also include medications (topical nasal decongestants or topicalnasal glucocorticosteroids) to reduce nasal congestion.However important these treatments are, they remainadjunct to primary asthma therapy 565,571. Nasal Polyps Nasal polyps associated with asthma and rhinitis, and often with aspirin sensitivity574, are seen primarily in patients who are over 40 years old, and they are moreprevalent in patients who have negative skin tests.Various studies have shown that 7 to 15 percent ofpatients with asthma have nasal polyps, with the highestfrequency of polyps seen among those over 50 years old.The same studies show that between 36 and 96 percent ofaspirin-intolerant patients have polyps and 29 to 70percent of patients with nasal polyps referred to ENTdepartments and allergy clinics, respectively, have asthma 574, 575. 144 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEChildren with nasal polyps should be assessed for cystic fibrosis immotile syndrome. Nasal polyps and topicalsteroid therapy has a well-established role in themanagement of this condition 571. Patients who have chronic nasal obstruction that persists in spite of treatmentmay benefit from surgery, although the role of nasal andsinus surgery in the management of nasal polyps has notbeen precisely established. OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA Asthma is the most common occupational respiratory disorder in industrialized countries576. Occupational asthma is defined as asthma caused by exposure to anagent encountered in the work environment. Over 300specific occupational agents are associated withasthma 577,578-580. It has been estimated that occupational factors are associated with about 1 in 10 cases of adultasthma, including new-onset disease and aggravation ofpre-existing asthma 576. Occupations associated with a high risk for occupational asthma include farming andagricultural work, painting (including spray painting),cleaning and janitorial work, and plastic manufacturing 577. Two types of occupational asthma are recognized:immunologically mediated and nonimmunologicallymediated. Immunologically mediated occupational asthma is more common and has a latency period ofmonths to years after the onset of exposure 581-583. The mechanisms by which a variety of occupational agentsinduce sensitization and asthma are largely unknown, but IgE-mediated allergic reactions, and possibly cell-mediated allergic reactions or both, are involved 584,585. Nonimmunologically mediated occupational asthma, orirritant-induced asthma, has no latency. Reactive airwaydysfunction syndrome (RADS) is the best example ofirritant-induced asthma. Typically asthma symptoms associated with airflow obstruction and/or airwayhyperresponsiveness occur within 24 hours followingaccidental exposure to a high concentration of an irritantgas, fume, or chemical in a previously healthy subject andlast for at least 3 months 586. A diagnosis of occupational asthma should be consideredin every adult patient with new or worsening asthma.Detection of asthma of occupational origin requires asystematic inquiry about the patient 's occupation and exposures as part of the clinical history. Improvement ofsymptoms away from work and worsening of symptoms onreturning to work suggest an occupational relationship.Since the management of occupational asthma frequentlyrequires the patient to change his or her job, the diagnosiscarries considerable socioeconomic implications and it isimportant to confirm the diagnosis by objective means.One method is to monitor PEF at least 4 times a day for a period of 2 weeks when the patient is working and for asimilar period away from work 582,587,588. This method is often used by itself, but additional monitoring of nonallergic airway hyperresponsiveness will ensure thatchanges in PEF with changing work exposure are actuallyreflect occupational asthma. There are very few centerswith facilities for specific inhalation testing to confirm anoccupational asthma diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is established, complete avoidance of the relevant exposure is the ideal management 581,582,589. Occupational asthma may not be completely reversibleeven several years after removal from exposure to thecausative agent especially when the patient has had symptoms for a long time before cessation of exposure 590,591. Continued exposure may lead to increasingly severe andpotentially fatal asthma exacerbations 592, a lower probability of subsequent remission, and, ultimately,permanently impaired lung function 593. Pharmacologic therapy for occupational asthma is identical to therapy forother forms of asthma, but it is not a substitute foradequate avoidance. Consultation with a specialist inasthma management or occupational medicine isadvisable. Atopy and tobacco smoking may increase the risk of occupational sensitization in some workers in specificoccupations. Screening individuals for atopy is of limitedvalue in preventing occupational asthma 581. The most important method of primary prevention of occupationalasthma is elimination or reduction of exposure throughsubstitution, and by adequate occupational hygienemeasures. RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS Respiratory infections have an important relationship to asthma as they provoke wheezing and increasedsymptoms in many patients. Epidemiological studies have found that respiratory viruses 594, possibly chlamydia, but seldom bacteria595, are the infectious microorganisms associated with increased asthma symptoms. The respiratory virus that most commonly causes wheezing ininfancy is respiratory syncytial virus 50, while rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, are the principal triggers ofwheezing and worsening of asthma in older children andadults 596. Other respiratory viruses, such as parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus, are alsoassociated with increased wheezing and asthmasymptoms 597. A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 145 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEA number of mechanisms have been identified to explain wheezing and increased airway responsiveness with respiratory infections, including damage to airwayepithelium, stimulation of virus-specific IgE antibody,enhanced mediator release, and the appearance of a lateasthmatic response to inhaled antigen 598. Thus there is evidence that viral infections are an \"adjuvant\" to the inflammatory response and promote the development ofairway injury by enhancing airway inflammation 599. Treatment of an infectious exacerbation follows the sameprinciples as in other asthma exacerbations; that is, rapid-acting inhaled /H92522-agonists and the early introduction of oral glucocorticosteroids or increase in inhaled glucocor-ticosteroids are recommended. Because increasedasthma symptoms can often last for weeks beyond theinfection, anti-inflammatory treatment should be continuedfor weeks to ensure adequate control. The role of antiviral therapy in preventing asthma exacerbations is currently being studied. To date, there isinsufficient evidence to assess the benefits and risk ofinfluenza vaccination in people with asthma 88. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX The relationship of increased asthma symptoms,particularly at night, to gastroesophageal reflux remains anissue of debate, although this condition is nearly 3 timesas prevalent in all patients with asthma 600-603. Most of these patients also have a hiatal hernia; furthermore, the use ofmethylxanthines may increase the likelihood of symptomsby relaxing the lower esophageal ring. Diagnosis can best be made by simultaneously monitoring esophageal pH and lung function. Medical managementshould be given for the relief of reflux symptoms as it isoften effective and includes eating smaller, more frequentmeals; avoiding food or drink between meals and especiallyat bedtime; avoiding fatty meals, proton inhibitors; using drugs that increase lower esophagealpressure; and elevating the head of the bed. Surgery is reserved for the severely symptomatic patient with well-documented esophagitis and failure of medicalmanagement; it is not successful for everyone. It shouldbe demonstrated that the reflux causes asthma symptomsbefore surgery is advised for patients with asthma 602,603. The role of antireflux treatment in asthma control is unclear as it does not consistently improve lung function,asthma symptoms, nocturnal asthma, or the use of asthma medications in subjects with asthma but withoutclear reflux-associated respiratory symptoms. Subgroupsof patients may benefit, but it appears difficult to predictwhich patients will respond to this therapy 604. ASPIRIN-INDUCED ASTHMA (AIA) In 4 to 28 percent of adults with asthma, but rarely inchildren with asthma, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause asthmaexacerbations. The variability depends on the diagnosticcriteria 605. The course of the disease and its clinical picture arecharacteristic 606. The majority of patients first experience symptoms during the third to fourth decade of life. Thetypical patient experiences intense vasomotor rhinitischaracterized by intermittent and profuse rhinorrhea. Over a period of months, chronic nasal congestion occurs, and physical examination often reveals nasalpolyps. Asthma and intolerance to aspirin develop during subsequent stages of the illness. In theseindividuals, asthma runs a protracted course. Theintolerance presents itself as a unique picture: within anhour following ingestion of aspirin, an acute asthmaexacerbation develops, often accompanied by rhinorrhea,conjunctival irritation, and scarlet flush of the head andneck. These reactions are dangerous; indeed, a singletherapeutic dose of aspirin or other anticyclooxygenaseagent can provoke violent bronchospasm, shock, loss ofconsciousness, and respiratory arrest 606,607. Persistent inflammation with marked eosinophilia,epithelial disruption, cytokine production, and upregulationof adhesion molecules is found in the airways of patientswith AIA 608. Eosinophilic infiltration of airway tissue is a central feature of AIA. Eosinophils are 4 times morenumerous in AIA patients than in aspirin-tolerant subjectswith asthma, and 15 times more numerous than in peoplewithout asthma 609. The airway expression of interleukin-5 (IL-5), which is known to be involved in the recruitment, activation, maturation, and survival of eosinophils, ismarkedly increased in patients with AIA 609. These patients, whose asthma is characterized by increased production ofcysteinyl leukotrienes, also exhibit bronchi. by a genetic polymorphismof the LTC4 synthase gene found in 70 percent of patientswith AIA 610, a common promoter variant that creates a predisposition to aspirin-sensitive asthma by reinforcingthe effector mechanism of bronchoconstriction. However,the exact mechanism by which aspirin acts oncyclooxygenase to trigger bronchoconstriction remainsunknown. 146 A SIX-PART ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTENot all of the offending drugs produce adverse reactions with the same frequency. This depends on a drug's anticy-clooxygenase potency and dosage as well as on theindividual sensitivity of the patient 564. Although a patient 's clinical history may raise suspicion of AIA, the diagnosis can be established with certainty onlyby aspirin challenge, conducted only where facilities forcardiopulmonary resuscitation exist. There are no in vitro tests suitable for routine clinical diagnosis. If confirmationof an AIA diagnosis is necessary, patients are challengedwhen their asthma is in remission and their FEV1is greater than 70 percent of predicted or personal best. Oralchallenge tests are hazardous and carry a risk ofprovoking a severe reaction; they should be replaced bythe safer inhalational challenge with lysine-aspirine 611. Nasal challenge is less sensitive but safer than inhalationtesting and can be used as an initial test of aspirinintolerance 612. All challenges should be carried out in the morning in the presence of a highly trained and experiencedphysician and with emergency treatment available. Thereaction is considered positive if at least a 15 percentdecrease in FEV1or PEF occurs, accompanied by symptoms of bronchial obstruction and irritation of nose oreyes. In the absence of these clinical findings, the reactionis considered positive only if a fall in FEV1or PEF greater than 20 percent occurs. Once aspirin or NSAID intolerance develops, it is present for life. Patients with AIA should avoid aspirin, all productscontaining it, and other analgesics that inhibit cyclooxygenaseand hydrocortisone hemisuccinate 613. However, such avoidance does not prevent the progression of theinflammatory disease. Glucocorticosteroids continue to bethe mainstay of therapy, and leukotriene modifiers may beuseful for additional control of the underlying disease 564,614 (Evidence B). For NSAID-sensitive patients with asthma who require NSAIDs for other medical conditions,desensitization may be conducted in the hospital under thecare of a specialist 615. After aspirin desensitization, daily ingestion of high doses of aspirin reduces inflammatorymucosal disease symptoms, especially in the nose, inmost patients with AIA 564. ANAPHYLAXIS AND ASTHMA Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening condition thatcan both mimic and complicate severe asthma. Effectivetreatment of anaphylaxis demands early recognition of theevent. The possibility of anaphylaxis should be consideredin any setting where medication or biological substancesare given, especially by injection. Examples of documentedcauses of anaphylaxis include the administration ofallergenic extracts in immunotherapy, food intolerance(nuts, fish, shellfish, eggs, milk), avian-based vaccines,insect stings and bites, latex hypersensitivity, drugs aspirin and NSAIDs, and angiotensinconverting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), and exercise. Risk factors for the occurrence of anaphylaxis include a prior history of anaphylaxis, the presence of atopy,unstable steroid-dependent asthma, allergenimmunotherapy, and the concomitant use of beta-blockersor ACE inhibitors 616. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include flushing, pruritis,urticaria, and angioedema; upper and lower airwayinvolvement such as stridor, dypsnea, wheezing, or apnea;dizziness or syncope with or without hypotension; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting,cramping, and diarrhea. The differential diagnoses ofacute anaphylaxis include acute urticaria, asthma,angioedema, and seizure. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis, oftenassociated with medication or food allergy, is a uniquephysical allergy and should be differentiated from exercise-induced asthma 617. Airway anaphylaxis could account for the sudden onset of asthma attacks and the relative resistance of attacks to acute doses of /H92522-agonists in severe \" brittle\" asthma 618, 619. If there is a possibility that anaphylaxis is involved in an asthma attack, epinephrine should be thebronchodilator of choice. Prompt treatment for anaphylaxisis and includes oxygen, aqueous epinephrine,injectable antihistamine, intravenous glucocorticosteroid,and intravenous fluid. Preventing a recurrence ofanaphylaxis depends on identifying the cause andinstructing the patient on avoidance measures and self-administered emergency treatment with preloadedepinephrine 616.

As a result, there has been aconsiderable research interest in a number of areas: (1) understanding the underlying pathophysiologicmechanisms that lead to asthma; (2) identifying risk factors and evaluating appropriate methods of risk factoravoidance; (3) evaluating existing management strategiesand developing new therapeutic approaches; and (4)developing and evaluating strategies to improve asthmacontrol and patients' quality of life. The development and evaluation of methods to incorporate new researchfindings into patient care, and the identification ofmeasures of the socioeconomic impact of asthma care,have also contributed to the impressive progress inasthma control that has been achieved in the past decade.Yet much work remains to be done and many researchavenues to be explored. This chapter provides a briefsketch of some of the important research questions thatneed answers. Special attention must be given toovercoming barriers to the implementation of asthmamanagement programs in developing countries whereresources are limited. 1.Genetics of Asthma: Family clustering of asthma and allergy suggests a genetic basis for the disease. However, the progressive increase in the prevalenceof asthma witnessed in the last two decades is most likely related to an interaction of environmentalfactors with genetic susceptibility, since the geneticbackground of the population has not changedsignificantly over this period. Further work is neededto clarify how genetic susceptibility interacts with thetiming of environmental exposure and of exposuresthat stimulate the immune system (e.g., in utero or during the first days of life) to cause or predisposeindividuals to asthma. Defining these interactions iskey to developing effective prevention strategies. Thegenetic basis of the variability in individual responsesto asthma treatments (pharmacogenetics) is animportant new area of exploration. 2.Pathogenesis and Mechanisms of Asthma:Additional research is needed to broaden understandingof the molecular, cellular, and immunologic mechanismsthat lead to asthma and affect its severity and chronicity.A better understanding of the events that initiate,direct, and perpetuate the development of airwayinflammation in response to both immunologic andnonimmunologic stimuli may lead to the identificationof new targets for treatment. In addition, reliable,noninvasive surrogate tests that reflect the inflammatoryresponse in asthma are needed. Investigating therelationship of pathological changes to indices of lung function and improving understanding of whatconstitutes airway remodeling are important priorities.A promising area of investigation involves mechanismsregulating the function of airway receptors, as evidencesuggests that a defect in beta-adrenergic receptorscould contribute to the development of asthma andmay lead to a more severe clinical course of thedisease. 3. Prevention: Intervention strategies for the primary prevention of asthma remain in the realm ofspeculation and hypothesis, yet primary preventionmay well be achievable if targets for intervention can be identified. Secondary prevention measures,such as those related to reducing exposure to known allergens and environmental insults, requirecontinued examination in carefully controlled clinical investigations, in several different populations andsocioeconomic settings, to determine their impact onreducing asthma symptoms and acute exacerbations. 4.Burden of Asthma: Epidemiologic and socioeconomic studies have the potential to help health plannersdefine risks and document the costs and benefits ofimproved management guidelines. However, toachieve these outcomes, data on asthma incidence,severity, hospitalization, and mortality are needed.Epidemiologic investigations can also aid inidentification of environmental exposures that influencethe rate of decline in lung function and increasedairway hyperresponsiveness. 5.Diagnosis and Monitoring: Development and validation of methods for early diagnosis, monitoring,and evaluation of asthma treatment are needed, withspecial attention to methods appropriate for use ininfants and young children. 6.Asthma Guidelines: Research is needed to determine the impact of national asthma programs and asthma guidelines at national, district, and locallevels in both developed and developing countries.Whether guidelines are useful as a basis for audit, forsetting standards, and for education should beexplored. Measures to assess outcomes of asthmacare need to be continually evaluated. 7.Patient Education and Delivery of Care: Although the efficacy of guided self-management has beendemonstrated for patients with asthma, numerousissues have yet to be clarified including the amount ofdetail needed; use of this strategy in people of differentages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds; and use and cost-effectiveness in different settings, 174 RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTEincluding health care facilities, schools, and the patient' s home. Studies to examine the most effective and efficient roles for patients, physicians, and otherhealth care professionals in guided self-managementand to determine the best way to integrate this strategyinto primary medical care should be conducted. Theeffective use of guided self-management in developingcountries requires special attention, due to problems of literacy, cultural attitudes, and barriers to medicalcare including the availability and cost of medications. It is also important to clarify the relative effectiveness of interventions delivered by different health careprofessionals and the impact of asthma supportgroups, tel ephone help lines, and new methods of communication and education such as e-mail andinteractive multimedia. The impact of these interventions on patients ' quality of life should be included in measurements of program effectiveness. 8.Severe Asthma: It has been estimated that 5 to 10 percent of patients with asthma have severe diseasethat is unresponsive to typical therapies. The genetic,molecular, cellular, and immunologic events that leadto severe asthma are unknown. The natural courseand causes of severe asthma need to be defined. 9.Alternative Medicine: In many parts of the world, \"alternative\" or \"traditional\" therapies have been reported to be of use in the treatment of asthma. The most widely used therapies are acupuncture,homeopathy, herbal medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine(which includes transcendental meditation, herbs, and yoga). However the use of these therapies inasthma has not been validated by controlled clinicaltrials, and their mechanisms of action are not clearlyunderstood. However, these therapies warrantscientific investigation to assess their efficacy and their relation to currently recommended managementapproaches. 10.Asthma Management: In the past two decades, the implementation of effective asthma treatments hasmade it possible for people with asthma to live fullyactive lives. However, additional research on newtherapeutic approaches, and continued work oncurrently available medications, remains essential.Evaluation of combination therapies, effectivetherapeutic doses in children and adults, interaction ofasthma medication with other medications (especiallyin elderly patients), and continued comparison ofvarious classes of medications in well-controlledrandomized clinical trials are key to future progress inasthma management. There are several other areas related to asthmamanagement that should be investigated: The long-term effects of asthma therapy on the natural history of asthma and on lung function require investigation. The efficacy of the step approach to asthma care, as recommended in this document, needs to beexamined in large populations of asthma patientsusing a variety of outcome measures, includingquality of life. The potential side effects of long-term use of inhaled glucocorticosteroids in both children and adults needto continue to be monitored. The risk of side effects from inhaled glucocorticosteroids needs to be examined inmalnourished children. A number of studies indicate a benefit from action plans that include an increase in inhaledglucocorticosteroids early in an asthma exacerbation.Although this concept has gained wide clinicalendorsement, randomized controlled trials arerequired. Long-term studies of leukotriene modifier therapies should be undertaken. The efficacy and applicability of the recommendations for the management of acuteasthma exacerbations in different health caresystems need to be studied. New inhaler devices are being developed and introduced at regular intervals. These require carefulevaluation and studies of cost-effectiveness. 11.New Approaches to Asthma Treatment: Several new therapeutic agents have been developed to target specific components of the inflammatory process inasthma, although they have not yet been proven to beparticularly effective. Targets of these agents includeIgE antibodies, cytokines, chemokines, and vascularadhesion molecules. Future developments mightinclude better forms of immunotherapy and treatmentstargeting the remodeling of structural elements of theairways. IgE antibodies: The concept that IgE plays a critical role in asthma pathogenesis has driven the RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS 175 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE176 RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONSdevelopment of IgE blockers, which are currently being introduced into clinical use. However, much remainsto be learned about the role of IgE in asthma and thegenetic and environmental influences that lead to itsproduction. Over the next few years, the emergingexperience with anti-IgE in patients will provide a morecomplete understanding of the mechanisms by whichIgE contributes to disease, as well as the therapeuticpotential of its inhibition. Cytokines: Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiologic roles of various cytokines in atopic diseases has provided the basis for the developmentof novel therapies. Approaches to cytokine inhibitioninclude blocking transcription factors that lead tocytokine theirrelease; cytokine IL-4, IL-13, and tumor necrosisfactor-/H9251 (TNF-/H9251 ) are among the targets of these new therapies. Chemokines and vascular adhesion molecules: It is now widely accepted that T lymphocytes play a primary role in orchestrating the processes of airwayinflammation through their capacity to generate arange of cytokines encoded by genes in the IL-4 genecluster on the long arm of chromosome 5. Additionalcytokines derived from mast cells and eosinophils alsoplay key roles, especially TNF- /H9251, which is responsible for initiating the upregulation of vascular adhesionmolecules involved in the recruitment of eosinophilsand other inflammatory cells from the circulation. Theimportance of CXC and CC chemokines as localchemoattractants and activating stimuli is alsorecognized. As more is learned about these factors, itwill be interesting to determine whether this knowledgewill lead to specific clinical applications in asthma.
