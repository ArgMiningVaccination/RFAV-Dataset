It helps the body identify and destroy harmful bacteria and viruses. It protects you from infections by fighting off viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens. The immune system also helps the body fight off injuries and cancer. There are many different types of cells in the immune system. These different cells work together to protect the body from infection. The immune system includes the tissues in your body's lymphatic system. It also includes blood cells called leukocytes, which travel throughout the body and attack foreign substances (called antigens) that have entered the body. When they find these antigens, they start to destroy them. However, there can be times when the immune system becomes dysfunctional. This can lead to conditions like allergies, asthma, and autoimmune diseases. There are many ways to improve your immune system condition. Some of these include diet, exercise, and supplements.
