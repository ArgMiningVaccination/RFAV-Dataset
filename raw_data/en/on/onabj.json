New Offerings by Established Practitioners and Businesses Dr. Monica Turenne, D.V.M., formed Four Paws Veterinary Wellness in May of this year. Four Paws is a house call practice that integrates Western medicine and Eastern modalities, such as acupuncture and Chinese herbology. Dr. Turenne has been practicing veterinary medicine for 13 years and has been certified in Veterinary Acupuncture since 2005. The new mobile practice fits Dr. Turenne's lifestyle preferences, giving her more flexibility than a building-based practice, and also fills a need for house call veterinary medicine. Her clients include busy professionals who don't have time to take pets to the vet, people who are housebound due to disability, housebound animals, and people who just appreciate the ability to have a vet work with their pets in the comfort of home. Four Paws caters to cats and dogs, and includes Dr. Turenne along with a Registered Veterinary Technician, Giuliana Scott. Scott and Turenne work together on most calls. Dr. Turenne says that most animals are much more comfortable at home than in a clinic setting. In all of her previous years working in a clinic, cats would never accept treats in the exam room, but they readily accept treats in their homes! Depending on the animal's needs and the owner's preferences, Dr. Turenne may use Western medicine, acupuncture, herbs, diet changes, or a combination of several treatment modalities. She shared a story about a dachshund with horrible back pain. The owner could not afford an M.R.I. for the dog, so Dr. Turenne began a treatment plan of herbs and acupuncture, with excellent results. The dachshund is now happy, healthy, and walking without pain. Another dog had surgery to remove a brain tumor, and Dr. Turenne used acupuncture and herbs to supplement the healing process in cooperation with his \"team\" of experts, just as a person with cancer might have. The dog is three months post-surgery and doing much better. A part of Dr. Turenne's practice is end-of-life care, which does include euthanasia, made somewhat easier for the animal and owners because it is performed in the home. Another option that may be appropriate for some pets, she says, is hospice. This means that, after a terminal diagnosis is made, Dr. Turenne works with the owners to make an end-of-life plan for the animal, ensuring that the animal will die peacefully and comfortably at home. This might include pain medications that were contraindicated when healing was the main goal, small things like moving food closer to the animal's bed, or providing steps for the animal to get into a bed or onto a couch, and even having photographs taken of the pet and deciding whether to hold a memorial service. Hospice may last anywhere from two days to six months, and allows the owner to begin the grieving process and say goodbye to their beloved companion animal while providing as much comfort and dignity to the pet as possible. Dr. Turenne says that the mobile practice is very rewarding, providing experiences that are \u2014 even more than in a building-based practice \u2014 \"different each day.\" She is called upon to be creative in providing care for her patients and enjoys the challenge and reward of this type of veterinary medicine. Perhaps surprisingly, Four Paws' rates are comparable to or lower than other veterinary practices, with just the addition of a modest travel fee (adjusted for the distance traveled). Carolyn Christopher and Kathy Wilkinson, certified Laughter Yoga teachers, have formed The Laughter Project, which brings Therapeutic Laughter Circles to Ann Arbor.See Article on page 16 Dr. Monica Turenne formed Four Paws Veterinary Wellness, a house call practice that integrates Western medicine and Eastern modalities, such as acupuncture and Chinese herbology.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 11 (For more information on Dr. Turenne's work with animals, see her article on Acupuncture for Dogs and Cats , on page 20 of Issue #47 -- January thru April 2011 -- of the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal , on our website's archive, at: http://www. crazywisdom.net/cw-community-journal.html.)

Kathy Moore has moved her longstanding and well-regarded voice training and music therapy business, Moore Voice, to a new Water Hill location and is reorienting her practice to focus more on creativity and mindfulness. In addition, she recently received her certification as a teacher of the Alexander Technique. Moore describes her new studio as sunny and large, with a high ceiling, allowing for more movement and freedom. In this new space, she offers small group creative recovery circles for people suffering from trauma, grief, divorce, and illness who can benefit from participating in the creative process. Moore cites creativity coach Eric Meisel as one source of inspiration for this type of creativity therapy. The Alexander Technique, Moore explains, is a process involving sensory awareness and mindfulness. Students are taught to notice old habits of movement and thought that inhibit them in order to undo them and replace them with new habits that allow for more freedom and ease. Moore works with students of all ages and backgrounds, from those focused on improving their singing or vocal technique to those looking for relief from trauma or depression to those who want to bring more creativity into their daily lives. As part of her own creative pursuits, Moore is currently working on a novel, writing songs, and planning a book about her work. (Kathy Moore was interviewed at length about her work as a musician and music therapist, by Judy Stone, in Issue #16 -- September thru December 2000 -- of the CW Journal . It is available on our website's archive.) Kathy Moore can be reached at 734-668-8146 or kathymooremusic@gmail.com. Susan Boyes, M.A., ATR-BC, L.P.C., has moved her art therapy practice, Center for Creative Growth, to a new location near the intersection of Packard and Stadium. Boyes has been providing art therapy since 1996 to individuals with disabilities and those experiencing medical trauma, grief, loss, relationship issues, Traumatic Brain Injury, and P .T.S.D. She explains that emotions are stored in the amygdala, a non-verbal section of the brain, and one way to access stored emotions is through images. Exploring these stored non-verbal emotions can help bring unconscious feelings into conscious awareness, increasing our ability to cope with them. For those with Traumatic Brain Injury, Boyes says that art therapy can actually promote neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons and neural pathways, and has been shown to promote significant healing and change. In October of 2011, when Boyes herself was diagnosed with cancer, she began to ask questions about her life and legacy and realized that she \"really should have done more art.\" After asking herself \"What am I here for?\" she concluded that she was here to have fun! For Boyes, this has meant \"making a mess with art materials\" and experiencing the artistic process through sight, touch, sound, and smell. She says art was a way of getting her through the chemotherapy process. She would bring art supplies to each chemo session, and just having something to do, she says, was immensely helpful. Boyes says her new studio has skylights and a cathedral ceiling, and is \"warm, welcoming, and full of art materials,\" as well as tables, chairs, easels, and a sink for washing up. Susan Boyes can be contacted by phone at 734-478-2394 and by email at susan@ centerforcreativegrowth.com. Her website is www.centerforcreativegrowth.com. Kathy Moore has moved her longstanding and well- established voice training and music therapy business, Moore Voice, to a new Water Hill location and is reorienting her practice to focus more on creativity and mindfulness.

Merel received a Digestive Health certification from the Loomis Institute in 2008 and has since been able to help people with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, I.B.S., rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, migraine headaches, psoriasis, and other serious illnesses by identifying food allergies and sensitivities. Alongside diagnostics like saliva, blood, and urine testing, he combines his knowledge of holistic health and functional medicine to help people facilitate the natural and instinctive healing process of the human body. Merel feels that healing from many illnesses is about the correct food choices and not supplements. Many times, when a client is diagnosed with a gluten sensitivity or other related food allergies or has been told they must eat a non-inflammatory diet, they are left feeling overwhelmed. To support those clients, Gary has teamed up with Robin Brophy, with whom he has partnered for the last year. Brophy received her herbal and nutritional training from the North American Institute of Medicinal Herbalism in Boulder, Colorado. As a food coordinator and cook for Grass Lake Sanctuary, a life balancing retreat center in Manchester, Michigan, she is passionate about creating new, healthy versions of the everyday foods we love. Her passion is in helping others to find their own unique relationship to food and to recognize that we know our bodies better than anyone else. She currently offers food consultations, coaching, and cooking classes at Aprill Wellness Center. Merel explains that he provides the \"clinical piece,\" determining what sensitivities a client's discomfort arises from, and Brophy provides the \"nutritional piece,\" helping the client create an eating plan that is sustainable and satisfying. Together Gary Merel and Robin Brophy offer a unique opportunity for people faced with health challenges to explore a new relationship to food and begin the journey of healing. Gary Merel can be reached at 734- 222-8210 and is online at www.annarborholistichealth.com and www.digestivehealth-annarbor.com. Robin Brophy can be reached at 303-525-6478. Both work with clients at the Aprill Wellness Center, 107 Aprill Drive, Suite 4, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103. Gary Merel of Ann Arbor Holistic Health has teamed up with nutritionist Robin Brophy to incorporate nutritional counseling into his practice. Nutritionist Robin BrophyContinued from page 11 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 13 Life Coach Deborah Campbell is introducing a new five-part group coaching workshop series for people who want to re-energize their work and lives. Campbell explains that group coaching \"combines the power of coaching with the gift of group support, and is more cost effective for those seeking change.\" This workshop series will cover the following topics: work-life balance, overcoming obstacles, creating a powerful vision for your life and work, setting and achieving the right goals, and being accountable to your goals and intentions. Day and evening times will be available for this coaching series and dates will be announced. Those interested in participating should contact Deborah Campbell by email at deborahcampbellcoach@gmail.com or phone at 734-645-6847. More information is available online at deborahcampbellcoach.com. Local author and holistic animal healer Shoh Nah Hah Lieh (Betsy Adams) has formed The Spiritual Evolution of the Animal Kingdom, LLC. Shoh Nah has been working with animals \"and their people\" for 30 years as a holistic animal healer. She explains that with this new business formation she will continue to offer all the holistic animal healing and human-animal energy bond work she has offered in the past but will be bringing the Spiritual Evolution aspect heavily into her work. Shoh Nah explains the Spiritual Evolution as a part of the evolution of the Earth and humanity as a whole. Animals have long served human beings, in many ways without love or appreciation from these human beings, but are now beginning to awaken to their own value. Animals, says Shoh Nah, are becoming uninterested in allowing their bodies to be unlovingly used. On her website, Shoh Nah collects animal experience stories and photos. Pointing out a picture of a cat whose two front legs were broken in Hurricane Sandy, she says that the cat is not interested in suffering, that it is clearly feeling the love that is its \u2014 and our \u2014 natural state. Another story tells of a goat that refuses to be milked until her owners express their appreciation for the gift she is giving them of her milk. The most important thing, she says, is that the animals are able to love themselves; that they stop \"taking on everyone else's stuff.\" She says that animals often download the negative experiences and suffering of humans. Across the world, many animals are dying and suffering, but Shoh Nah says this is all a part of the evolution toward a different way of life in which the animals are \"living in the love.\" In addition to her healing work, Shoh Nah is working on a book called The Spiritual Evolution of the Animal Kingdom , which she will self-publish through Balboa Press. (For readers interested in learning more about Betsy Adams' exceptional work with animals, The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Betsy Adams was published in Issue #25 -- September thru December 2003 -- of the CW Journal , and is available on our website's archive.)

Local Shamanic practitioners Kate Durda, M.A., and Stephanie Tighe, M.S.W., of Spirit Weavers have become involved with a new initiative of the Society of Shamanic Practitioners: Shamanism Without Borders (SWB). Says Durda, \"SWB is similar to Doctors without Borders, except that for spiritual healing we do not have to physically travel to the event or site in need of healing, balance, or prayers.\" Durda and Tighe are heading up the Great Lakes Chapter of SWB, Great Lakes Shamans, which they kicked off with a one-day gathering in the summer of 2012. In October, they organized one of five national SWB kickoff conferences. The weekend-long conference focused on \"Healing the Earth, Healing Within,\" and included a pilgrimage to the 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill site. Durda explains that the Earth can fix itself when imbalances are present, but people can offer support. This is part of what it means to be a shaman \u2014 offering spiritual energy and spiritual healing. The shaman seeks to achieve an energy state of being \"hollow-boned\" \u2014 a place of no thoughts where problems can be worked with On April 6, 2013, Spirit Weavers will host a Shamanism Without Borders (SWB) workshop and invite shamanic practitioners to join them in continuing to create a Great Lakes Shamans' SWB community.

Bowen and /f_ind out why Bowenwork is called the \"Alternative Therapy to Alternative Therapies!\" What's New in the CommunityThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 14 directly. When this state is reached, the practitioner can radiate peace and balance, bringing peace and balance to the people, land, animals, or element being worked with. Durda described a ceremony for \"Healing the Waters of the World.\" As an experiment, shamans poured hydrochloric acid into a bowl of water, bringing the pH level to about 11 (acidic enough to kill a person who drank it). By reaching this \"hollow-boned\" state and radiating balance, the shamans were able to reduce the pH level of the water to 7 or 8 (neutral or slightly acidic). The October Kalamazoo River pilgrimage included a \"Despacho\" ceremony \u2014 a tradition of the Andes in which the Earth is given offerings and the shamans send intentions of hope and light through the land. The group used a heart-shaped crystal, which they infused with their intentions of healing for the land, and then buried it on the riverbank to continue to radiate healing energy. \"Ceremony,\" says Durda, \"is a powerful way of shifting energy.\" She describes another ceremony called \"H'oponopono,\" which is from the Hawaiian people. In it, the practitioner asks, \"What did I do to help cause this?\" and \"How can I change my dream and expectations of the world?\" As an example, Durda explains that one option is to get angry at the oil companies that cause oil spills, but since we are all part of the same web, that anger reflects back on the whole and healing cannot be accomplished. When we recognize our unity with all people and the world, anger can be let go and healing can begin. As part of this new Shamanism Without Borders initiative, Durda and Tighe hope to re-inspire the Midwest shamanic community by providing more support to one another on the path. They also hope to extend their media reach and involve more people who are not shamanic practitioners but would benefit from the work that shamans do. They envision more public ceremonies to help the general public find more balance and unity. Durda speculates that if SWB had existed at the time of September 11, shamans across the country could have organized ceremonies right away to help the general public begin regaining its equilibrium from fear and despair sooner. \"We are the people we've been waiting for,\" says Durda, and she and Tighe are striving to live up to that expectation and encourage other shamanic practitioners to do so as well. SWB is still a new initiative. The shamans involved are working on envisioning exactly how the movement will look and how it will provide support for practitioners, the Earth, and people in general. Anyone interesting in learning more or becoming part of this work is encouraged to contact Spirit Weavers. On April 6, 2013, from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., they will host a Shamanism Without Borders workshop and invite shamanic practitioners to join them in continuing to create a Great Lakes Shamans' SWB community. Details about the April 6 event, including the location, will be available online at www.spiritweavers.net. Kate Durda and Stephanie Tighe can be reached by phone at 517-667-0694 or by email at SpiritWeavers@gmail.com. Books by Area Authors Randy Weiser, known as Puck Shadowdrake in the Pagan community, has completed his first book. Magickal Manners: A Guide to Magickal Etiquette will be released in February 2013 by Dark Moon Press. Weiser is a Third Degree Elder in the Georgian tradition and the High Priest of the Ypsilanti-area Circle of the Samhain Moon. He has been involved with the Pagan community for 35 years. He occasionally serves as a Pagan chaplain for the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration Hospital and he has taught at the Crazy Wisdom, at the earth religionist convention, ConVocation, and at other local venues. Weiser says that the book has been in the works for about 10 years. Much that is written in the book, he says, has never been written down in a comprehensive way. The book is long, about 600 pages, and includes some common sense advice (\"never invoke anything you can't banish\"), and instructions for things, such as your first ritual or how to perform a ritual bath, how to deal with intolerance from other religions, and advice on such odd situations as \"what to do when the police are raiding your circle.\" Advice is even offered on \"coming out as a witch or Pagan\" to family members. There are chapters on teaching, and Weiser says, more importantly, \"how not to teach.\" He uses examples of his own growth as a teacher, in which he says he has occasionally suffered from bouts of \"unbridled ego,\" which he calls \"high-priest-itis.\" Magickal Manners will premier at ConVocation, held February 21-24, 2013, in Dearborn, Michigan. It will be available through Crazy Wisdom, and at Amazon. com, including a version for the Kindle e-reader, and through the leading Pagan catalogues, Abyss and Azure Green . This is Weiser's first book but will not be his last. Dark Moon has extended a contract for two additional books. The first of the two will be on guided meditations, and he hopes to have it ready within two years. The third book will be an anthology of Pagan humor. Randy Weiser can be reached by email at Puckshadowdrake@yahoo.com. More information about ConVocation is available online at www.convocation.org. Dark Moon Press is online at www.darkmoonpress.com. Upcoming Events Marijo Grogan, A.C.S.W., has returned to Ann Arbor after a 10-year collaboration with Art 634 in Jackson, Michigan, to open a psychotherapy practice at the Aprill Wellness Center. These days, says Grogan, the \"bible\" of her practice is Dr. Mark Hyman's work The UltraMind Solution . Hyman espouses seven \"Keys to UltraWellness,\" including: identifying nutritional factors, balancing hormones, cooling off inflammation, fixing digestion, enhancing detoxification, boosting energy metabolism, and calming the mind. Grogan also incorporates some assessment and intervention tools from Chinese medicine. Grogan will offer four Sunday afternoon workshops at the Aprill Wellness Center from January through April. Each workshop runs from 2:00-4:30 p.m. and will carry a nominal fee of $10-15. On Sunday, January 20, she will present The Grail Quest (a spiritual approach to healing). In 2004, Grogan published an article in the American Humanistic Psychology Perspective titled \"The Grail Quest: A Model for Personal and Communal Healing.\" She describes the Grail Quest as \"one of the greatest spiritual legacies in Western tradition.\" Participants will explore concepts of the Grail Quest, which parallel psychological and spiritual states of development. On Sunday, February 17, she will present The Seven Keys to Wellness & Chinese Five-Element Theory (a holistic approach to healing). Participants will learn to use Hyman's seven assessment keys as well as another assessment tool based in the Chinese Five-Element Theory. On Sunday, March 17, Grogan will present Awakening The Dreamer (a communal approach to healing). A video presentation will be shown of Awakening the Dreamer , a seminar being held around the world to enhance personal and communal healing at this important time in history. Participants will also work with reflective and interactive exercises to complement the experience. On Sunday, April 21, she will present Metaphors & Mandalas (a creative approach to healing). Participants will learn how metaphors can help in the healing of trauma, depression, and anxiety. They will also create their own mandala art. No artistic experience or talent is necessary to express personal healing symbology. More information on Marijo Grogan is available at MarijoGrogan.com.

Kim Cardeccia, M.A., L.P.C., is now hosting equine assisted healing workshops. Cardeccia has been a licensed counselor for 11 years, but has been \"into horses\" for her entire life. Six years ago she combined her two passions by beginning to practice equine assisted psychotherapy. Horses, she explains, can help people to explore and embrace their own leadership style and bring body, mind, and spirit into alignment. \"In order to reach our goals, our thoughts, behaviors, and feelings all have to be headed in the same direction,\" she explains. Feedback from the horses can help people get into this state of alignment. Working with horses, she says, is experiential, and in some ways less threatening than working with people. She says something always happens with the horses to make the experience more than she could provide by herself. Cardeccia began offering equine assisted healing workshops in 2012. She describes the workshops as something like a mix of a riding clinic and group therapy. Participants learn about how horses communicate and put their trust in a leader. Each participant gets about half an hour of one-on-one horse time, in which they Continued from page 13 Marijo Grogan will offer four Sunday afternoon workshops at the Aprill Wellness Center from January through April, with topics including: The Grail Quest, The Seven Keys to Wellness & Chinese Five-Element Theory, Awakening the Dreamer, and Metaphors & Mandalas.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 15 What's New in the Community are able to explore their own leadership style and get out of the \"autopilot\" many people run on most of the time. By disrupting these \"autopilot\" cycles and being in a relaxed state around the horses, Cardeccia explains that we can access the subconscious faster than under other circumstances and create new patterns of behavior more effectively. The next equine assisted workshop will take place in January of 2013, with the date to be announced on Cardeccia's website: www.hiddenpromisecampus.com. Kim Cardeccia can be contacted by telephone at 517- 898-5094 or by email at kim@hiddenpromisecampus.com. The workshops are held at 9484 Dean Road, Fenton, Michigan 48430. New Classes Dena Bowen, an associate Bowenwork instructor and owner and operator of Bowen Touch Pain Relief Therapy, is presenting an introductory Bowenwork class called Wellness In Your Hands that is open to everyone. Wellness in Your Hands is a four-hour hands-on class that teaches the most important Bowenwork movements. Bowenwork is a soft touch therapy that is easily applied, deeply relaxing, and directly affects the nervous system. The gentle moves stimulate the body's own healing response that resets tension patterns in the body. It is safe and can be used on everyone from infants to the elderly, elite athletes, and people with chronic conditions. In this introductory class, participants will learn to apply key elements of Bowenwork to different parts of the body to help ease breathing difficulties, relieve muscle tension, joint pain, stiffness, ease heartburn, acid reflux, gastrointestinal complaints, relieve knee and back problems, address injuries, and more. Participants can immediately apply the skills that they have learned to assist their families and friends with relief of stress, pain, injury, and shock. \"There has been an overwhelming response to this class,\" says Bowen, \"and many people, such as parents, husbands and wives, caretakers, teachers, and emergency personnel, are asking to learn the Bowenwork technique. It is so rewarding to be able to teach the most important Bowenwork moves that will help a mother put her child to sleep, to give immediate support to an injury, or to help a husband offer pain relief to his wife. I wish I had this knowledge of Bowenwork when I was raising my own children; it would have been very useful. Today, my grandchildren know exactly what it is and ask for it by name.\" Penny Talbert of Westland, Michigan, recently took the Bowenwork class in October and was immediately able to apply what she had learned in class when her 11-year-old daughter, Joslyn, fell down and injured her wrists and knees while riding on a motor scooter. Penny said, \"I also use Bowenwork on my husband for relief of low back pain and use the relaxation moves on friends and family too.\" Wellness in Your Hands is being offered on Monday, January 7, 2013, from 6:00- 10:00 p.m. at Jump-In Professional Services in Hamburg, Michigan. The cost of this class is $75.00 and students will receive a Bowenwork beginner's manual with photos and anatomical illustrations. For more information about this class, contact Dena Bowen at 810-824-1604 or bowentouch1@yahoo.com. More information about Dena Bowen is available online at www.denabowen.com. New Practitioners and Businesses Amy Advey, M.S.W., L.M.S.W., opened her psychotherapy and sex therapy practice in Ann Arbor in March. Advey is a licensed social worker with over 10 years' experience in outpatient behavioral health, community mental health, and inpatient substance abuse rehabilitation. In October, she completed her Sexual Health Certificate at the University of Michigan, with a sex therapy focus. Advey explains that sex therapy is talk therapy that can help with sexual problems like low desire for sex, low arousal, erectile dysfunction, anorgasmia, sexual pain, and sexual aversion. She says, \"It is beneficial to approach sex therapy from a biopsychosocial perspective. With the advent of medications like Viagra, we have seen a medicalization of sexuality in health, but a prescription for Viagra does not address the psychological and interpersonal aspects of sex.\" She says that sex is not just a matter of physicality, but of expectations, hopes, relationships, and traumas. Advey says she was drawn to a specialization in sex therapy in part because it is straightforward. \"Feelings and beliefs come out quickly,\" she says, while traditional therapy might spend months trying to get to the heart of the issues. Advey grew up in a Catholic household where sex was not discussed. She has noticed a lot of discomfort with the topic of sexuality, even among therapists and health care providers, and wanted to create a safe space for clients to discuss these often unaddressed, emotionally charged issues. Advey is happy to work with people of all backgrounds. She is respectful of religious beliefs and will work with clients within the context of those beliefs. She is also very interested in helping LGBT populations; having watched a close friend transition from female to male has interested her in transgender issues. Advey works with couples and individuals, and also provides psychotherapy for depression, anxiety, mood disorders, posttraumatic stress, relationship problems, and other issues. Amy Advey can be reached at 734-585-4746 or at info@amyadvey.com. Her practice is located at 2030 Packard Street, Suite B, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104. More information is available on her website, www.amyadvey.com. Carole Pfeiffer, Ph.D., started her shaman healing practice, Ancient Light, in February of 2012. Pfeiffer says her unique background as a behavioral neuroscientist, a certified hypnotherapist, and a Ph.D. in psychopharmacology \"gives me the opportunity to offer my clients that elusive bridge between science and spirit.\" In 2006, Pfeiffer traveled to Peru and met a shaman there. This sparked an interest, leading her to read a book by Dr. Alberto Villoldo, a scientists and medical anthropologist who studied with the shamans of the Andes and the Amazon. Villoldo is the founder of the Four Winds Society, where Pfeiffer went on to receive her training in shamanism. She explains that shamanic healing involves working with a person's Luminous Energy Field (LEF), which contains imprints of all of our past interactions, traumas, and illnesses. The images lie dormant until something or someone triggers them, causing a cascade of information through the chakra system and the nervous and endocrine systems to mimic the reaction to the original trauma. Pfeiffer explains that this causes our personal history to repeat itself. Awareness of these patterns is not always enough to eliminate them; thus a shaman like Pfeiffer helps people to clear these detrimental energetic imprints. She says that, in neuroscience, she was able to study the brain on a micro level by looking at neurotransmitter levels and their correspondence with disease states. In hypnotherapy, she was able to look at brain function and the ability to reroute neural pathways through suggestion and the subconscious mind. \"So, after studying the neurotransmitters and exploring how thoughts and the subconscious mind affect the nervous system, the next logical step was to see how those thoughts are formed and go directly to the source. Shamanism, to me, is going to that source.\" Kim Cardeccia is offering equine assisted healing workshops that combine a riding clinic and group therapy. She says horses can help people to explore and embrace their own leadership style and bring body, mind, and spirit into alignment. Amy Advey opened her psychotherapy and sex therapy practice in Ann Arbor to create a safe space for clients to discuss the often unaddressed, emotionally charged issues surrounding sex, expectations, hopes, relationships, and traumas. Continued on page 16Kim Cardeccia, & Hidden PromiseThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 16 What's New in the Community Pfeiffer says that the techniques and tools used by shamans are different and unique to the individual. In her practice, she uses tools such as medicine stones, rattles, and pendulums to help her clients let go of behavioral patterns, illnesses, and toxic relationships. She explains that, since energy has no boundaries, she can assist clients over the telephone as well as in person. In fact, clients have been able to report what part of their energy field she is working with over the phone, and sometimes the phone sessions are even more effective than in-person sessions because there is less energy, such as thought energy, that may get in the way. Pfeiffer is currently seeing clients at the Center for Sacred Living off of Jackson Road in Ann Arbor. Email her at carole.pfeiffer@gmail.com or call her at 734-645-7217 to schedule an appointment. Amy and Markus Koch were recently inspired to move to Chelsea from the Seattle area and they have formed Whitecrane Therapeutics. Amy Koch is a physical therapist and spiritual medium who specializes in energy medicine with sound and light and holistic bodywork. Markus Koch is a former NFL player, massage therapist, and student of Jin Shin Do Bodymind Acupressure who specializes in treating the spirit, mind, and body with acupressure and reflexology. Both are certified yoga instructors. Whitecrane Therapeutics has offices in Ann Arbor, Chelsea, and Jackson. In addition to their hands-on therapies, Amy and Markus offer Crystal Light Bed sessions in Chelsea and Jackson. Amy explains that the Crystal Light Bed comes from John of God's Casa de Dom Inacio in Brazil and combines the power of color and crystal healing therapy to produce beneficial stimulation on many levels. Specially cut healing crystals are positioned over the chakras and colored light is focused through them, pulsing in rhythmic patterns. In addition to the healing properties of the colored light and crystals, Amy explains that Light Beings who work in and around the Casa in Brazil channel their healing energy through the crystals to the individual using the bed. These Light Beings were healers, such as doctors, while alive, who choose to continue their healing work after death. She says that for Crystal Light Bed sessions, she and Markus will meditate and hold space around the bed while the Light Beings are working. The Jackson Crystal Light Bed is located at the Corinthians Center for Healing and Spiritual Growth, run by Connie and Daniel Price. Amy and Markus met Connie and Daniel when they traveled to Michigan for a healing service in June. This meeting inspired the couple to relocate to the Ann Arbor area -- they were attracted to the Ann Arbor area's vibrant holistic community, combined with its relatively small town feel.Amy and Markus emphasize that they do not neglect the physical in their treatments. They intentionally treat the whole person, bridging the emotional, mental, and spirit realms in order to facilitate healing for the entire being. Amy and Markus Koch can be reached at whitecranetherapeutics@gmail.com or by phone at 734-660-0898. Their website is at www.whitecranetherapeutics.com. Carolyn Christopher and Kathy Wilkinson, certified Laughter Yoga teachers, have formed The Laughter Project, which brings Therapeutic Laughter Circles to Ann Arbor. Therapeutic Laughter, created by Dr. Madan Kataria and known in India as Laughter Yoga, is the practice of \"unconditional laughter\" as a form of exercise. No jokes, comedy, or even a \"sense of humor\" are needed. Over 70,000 Laughter Circles exist in over 70 countries. Studies have established that laughter can relieve stress, enhance the immune system, and improve creativity, self-esteem, and communication skills. The Laughter Project works with groups at Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital, the Michigan Public Health Institute, the University of Michigan, and Washtenaw Community College, as well as other organizations. Laughter Circles consist of yogic breathing Amy and Markus Koch have formed Whitecrane Therapeutics that features Crystal Light Beds that come from John of God's Casa de Dom Inacio in Brazil, at their Jackson and Chelsea locations. Continued from page 15 Amy Koch Carolyn Christopher Kathy Wilkinson The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 17 and laughing exercises, visualization, singing, hand clapping, Ayurveda point tapping on the hands, and frequent eye contact between the teacher and participants. \"When you look into someone's eyes who is laughing, you can't avoid laughing yourself,\" says Christopher. She has quite a collection of hats and other props for the Laughter Circles and changes them regularly during her presentation. During the Circle, laughter is simulated during the exercises, but soon turns genuine as participants surrender to the childlike glee. Christopher explains that the body cannot tell the difference between simulated laughter and real laughter, and so it receives the same physiological and psychological benefits from either. The Laughter Project also offers experiential seminars, team building, ice breaker seminars, or any event where laughter can make a difference and improve the environment.

Your gut instincts are right You can balance your energy Your body can heal itself Your body, mind and spirit are connected The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 18 By Will Hathaway The election is over but a political struggle continues in Ann Arbor. On one side are those who view the future of our downtown as 14-story skyscraper towers built as high and as wide as the zoning will allow. This \"dense development\" team is pushing big buildings. Some of the maximum density proponents even brandish a consultant's study that claims Ann Arbor could support a downtown hotel/conference center. On the other side are advocates for a more human-scale land use. This lower density alternative is a downtown with new construction, but it also includes public parks and plazas \u2014 common spaces where people sit to view performances, where kids have space to run around, where public art can be appreciated \u2014 perhaps even played with! The choice between these two competing visions is imminent. City Council will decide the fate of five publicly owned parcels based on the recommendations of a subcommittee of the Downtown Development Authority (DDA) expected sometime in December 2012. What City Council decides to do with these plots of land will shape the character of our city for generations. One of these parcels is the Library Lot. Located next to the downtown library, it is the site of the new, underground parking structure. Currently this 700-space parking ramp is crowned with another 40 surface parking spaces \u2014 temporarily. What happens with the ground level \"roof\" of this underground lot is a central question in the downtown land use debate. Background As long as people can remember, there was a large, surface parking lot next to the library. Various people have advocated for it to become a downtown park. When the Liberty Plaza \"pocket park\" was created in the late 1970s, many saw potential for connecting that small public space with an adjacent Library Lot park. The dream of a central park for Ann Arbor seemed attainable. Our town could finally reclaim the public square we lost in the 1950s when the stately, old County Courthouse was torn down \u2014 its generous lawn replaced with more concrete. The vision of a city plaza on the Library Lot was enshrined in the 2006 Calthorpe Report, the result of a lengthy public process which proposed a \"Town Square or central civic area that incorporates an outdoor meeting place, an art center, underground parking, an indoor facility and mixed-use buildings.\" The City of Ann Arbor, through the DDA, pushed forward with the underground parking. However, the vision of a public plaza was subordinated to a competing vision for dense development. The underground parking design assumed a skyscraper would be built on top. Extra millions were spent on reinforced footings and infrastructure to support the speculative tower. In 2009, the City issued a \"Request for Proposals\" (RFP) for the Library Lot. Following a long process, during which two proposals for public parks were dismissed out of hand, a 15-story, combination hotel/conference center seemed the winner. Upon closer examination, the Valiant proposal was determined economically unfeasible without a huge investment of public funds. City Council said no. After it rejected the hotel/conference center, City Council sought another way to build consensus for decisions about the publicly owned downtown land. To solicit input from the community about the future of the downtown, City Council turned to another branch of local government, the DDA. The DDA's Flawed Public Process A \"robust\" public process \u2014 that was the charge to the DDA when City Council directed that it study five publicly owned properties. Many interpreted that description to mean that the process would allow for meaningful input from the entire community. Unfortunately that has not been the case. The DDA leadership entered into this project, which it named \"Connecting William Street,\" with a preconceived desired outcome of dense development including a downtown hotel. The process it has designed and executed has, unsurprisingly, confirmed those preconceived ideas, resisting any contrary inputs such as lack of support for a hotel and the persistent and overwhelming call for downtown public parks. What did the DDA do to create a public process? Excluded people with different views from its steering committee \u2014 a tactic proudly announced in advance by one DDA leader \u2014 and it excluded public comments during committee meetings. Selectively \"cherry-picked\" from past planning documents those items that supported dense development and then claimed an archival \"consensus.\" Designed an unscientific and biased multiple-choice survey as the primary means for public input. Then limited the pool of respondents by distributing the survey almost entirely online. Dismissed the overwhelming pro-park survey response that was received despite the survey's designed bias in favor of development. Hired a land use economist with expertise in the economic benefits of urban parks, but did not ask him to assess potential benefits of a downtown park for Ann Arbor. Commissioned the consultant to do a feasibility study for a downtown hotel/conference center for Ann Arbor \u2014 the same idea that was rejected as unfeasible a year earlier by City Council. Held focus group meetings during which three development \"scenarios\" were presented and feedback was channeled toward selecting between \"dense, denser and densest\" options for new construction on the public land.Ann Arbor's Missing Central Park Our vision for a downtown park is informed by the concept of place-making through which urban neighborhoods around the world are being transformed. What City Council decides to do with these plots of land will shape the character of our city for generations. When the Liberty Plaza \"pocket park\" was created in the late 1970s, many saw potential for connecting that small public space with an adjacent Library Lot park. The dream of a central park for Ann Arbor seemed attainable. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 19 Despite repeated protests, the DDA moved forward with this process as if it would yield a true representation of what the public wants. Analysis of the DDA's own survey data shows walking , parks and events/culture as the top items the public would like to see downtown. Those of us who tried to represent the public's interest in downtown parks eventually concluded that we would not get a fair hearing. Having the DDA overseeing a public process to determine the future of the downtown was, in this instance, a fox guarding the chicken coop. No amount of contradictory information would shake the fox from its instinctive appetite. The Library Green Conservancy When the City voted down the hotel/conference center in spring 2011, a group of citizens began meeting with the goal of promoting a park on the Library Lot. We call this vision for a future park \"Library Green.\" We've formed a non-profit organization called the Library Green Conservancy. While the construction crew was busy excavating the hole for the new underground parking, we were busy meeting with members of City Council, developers, business and community leaders, and adjacent property owners and neighbors to talk about our idea of a central downtown park and to listen to their concerns and suggestions. We learned a lot. We know there are other potentially competing views for the future of the Library Lot. We also know that there are those with concerns about the possible negative impacts of public space in the downtown. The Library Green Conservancy wants the City to move to create a public plaza on a significant portion of the Library Lot now rather than waiting for some future developer. We recognize it will take creative design to ensure this plaza is a vibrant public space. Imagine a fun water feature with kids playing and parents watching \u2014 an ice rink in winter. How about interactive public art like The Cube on Regents Plaza? Some have said that neighboring businesses need to take \"ownership\" of a downtown park. We agree; there should be tables and chairs on the Library Lot as there are at Sculpture Plaza near the Peoples' Food Co-op. Our vision for a downtown park is informed by the concept of place-making through which urban neighborhoods around the world are being transformed. Place-making relies on economic development generated by proximity to an attractive, public open space. Once a lively plaza is created, the existing buildings nearby could be \"reborn,\" with new, expanded uses. New construction would occur and more customers will be drawn to the area. According to the City of Ann Arbor's 2009 Downtown Plan, the only downtown park right now is Liberty Plaza, a relatively tiny public space with limitations due to its physical design. A pedestrian link from Liberty Plaza to a Library Green would enhance both spaces. It would be Ann Arbor's downtown Diag. The Ann Arbor District Library draws thousands of people downtown. Like libraries in other cities, the Ann Arbor public library could extend itself in relation to an adjacent park. The new underground structure is well designed \u2014 in some ways architecturally beautiful. It merits a better crown than a surface parking lot and Ann Arbor deserves a true public square at the center of our downtown.

From major corporations to smaller businesses, business owners all over the state had been downsizing, reorganizing, and out-and-out closing their doors since the economic meltdown in 2008. And yet, as the economy in Michigan has begun to slowly improve, there are still brave souls who have taken the leap of faith to open their own businesses here, and others who have revitalized their older businesses. What follows are profiles of two interesting businesses that are thriving despite the odds. Cool. People. Mix. Downtown Ypsilanti's Bright and Shining Jewel:Mix Retail, Studio Theater, and Marketplace Ed & Bonnie Penet and Markel & Leslie Leland, owners Mix Retail and Studio Theater, 130 W. Michigan Avenue, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48197; Mix Marketplace, 200 W. Michigan 48197; 961-8704; email: Bonnie Penet and Leslie Leland, along with their spouses, Ed and Markel, opened Mix, a retail venue that specializes in new and used clothing, household goods, art, and jewelry. What began as a small business now flourishes as a diverse venture encompassing a mix of pleasures to please most any pallet. Bonnie and Leslie first met working on the art fair circuit and at the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market, and both are artists in their own right. Bonnie creates beautiful Women of Power dolls designed to remind women of their inner power, while Leslie and her husband, Markel Leland, create colorful and vibrant indoor/outdoor sculpted metal paintings. Both Bonnie and Leslie began their forays into the worlds of art fairs and the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market around 1991. In 1998, Leslie and Markel decided to open a retail store, Purplebabymommies, in downtown Ann Arbor on Liberty Street. They asked Bonnie to help them renovate and remodel the space. Bonnie also worked in management and sales in the store until Leslie and Markel decided to move its location to Key West, Florida, in 1999. From 1999 to 2006, while the Leland's ran a busy store on Duval Street in Key West, Bonnie Penet established a successful business selling high-end, gently-used art clothes on eBay. \"I've always been in love with clothing,\" Bonnie said. \"It's a passion.\" Penet sold a very carefully curated collection of used clothing on eBay for a number of years, additionally setting up shop at bazaars and sales in really good neighborhoods and at weekly music festivals, which helped her to develop a repeat clientele. \"People asked me how they were going to find me in the wintertime, and could they just come to my house.\" In 2006, after Key West was hit by eight hurricanes in two years, the Lelands returned to Michigan and rented an art studio in Ypsilanti. A chance meeting with Bonnie and Ed Penet sparked a conversation about opening a store, only this time, a store that would be a blend of new and used gift, furniture, and household items. Thus, the name Mix. Adding Bonnie's collection of second-hand women's clothing to the \"mix\" was almost an afterthought. \"We started out with mostly second-hand,\" Bonnie said. \"I'd been selling clothing on eBay for years, so I had a lot of stock, knowledge of price range, and always had my eye on the artistic.\" While the variety of merchandise was highly appealing, the store owners were surprised to find that it was the women's clothing and accessories that became the strongest sellers. \"You know, you fill your house with furniture and decor,\" Leslie explained, \"and you only need gifts from time to time, but women can never have too many clothes or too much jewelry.\" Second-hand clothing sales were the main feature at Mix for the first year before Bonnie and Leslie ventured out to a women's clothing apparel and accessories show \"just to look.\" Deciding to take a chance, they ordered new clothing to sell in the store in the spring of 2010. When the new clothing arrived, women were buying it as it was being unpacked from the boxes. Today, the clothing that the store offers is mostly new and has grown to include more than ten different lines of artistically chic women's clothing, drawing a loyal customer base that is rapidly growing. High-end, gently-used clothing and accessories are still offered, and a used book, CD, and DVD section has recently been added. Drawing on their prior experience with design and merchandising, they renovated their new storefront into \"a completely presentable space\" by the time Mix opened on December 1, 2009. \"There was total excitement on our part about the space.... We immediately put up lots of lights, painted the floors and walls in warm, appealing colors, and filled it with merchandise that we loved,\" Bonnie recalled. Folks in town seemed to be excited as they drove past the space, because someone, it appeared, was moving back into downtown Ypsilanti. \"You could see excitement on the faces of drivers passing by along Michigan Avenue. They wanted to know what was happening, so many of them turned around and drove back by.\" Ypsilanti has been one of the last towns in Southeastern Michigan to develop, making the cost of doing business attractive for potential independent business owners. \"Here we were, lucky to be sitting in this gem of a town with its charming architecture, a very supportive business community, and wonderfully supportive clientele who are anxious to see Ypsilanti succeed. It was the perfect time and place to be bootstrapping a new business in a difficult economy, and still is. In the three years since we've opened, we've watched as the town has blossomed with strong, thriving businesses,\" Leslie said. In addition to running the store, the Lelands and Penets have been busy establishing Mix Studio Theater and Mix Marketplace, the other components of their business. \"One of the things we did in lieu of advertising was to stage events as a way of attracting people,\" Ed explained. \"We held entertainment here inside the store and helped launch the First Class Blues Band, which is now, two years later, opening at the Greektown Casino.\" A chance meeting sparked a conversation about opening a store, only this time, a store that would be a blend of new and used gift, furniture, and household items Thus, the name \"Mix.\" Deciding to take a chance, they ordered new clothing to sell in the store in the spring of 2010. When the new clothing arrived, women were buying it as it was being unpacked from the boxes.Bonnie and Leslie The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 21 Ed designed and made the clothes racks in the store with wheels so they could be moved when they were hosting events. \"We call it 'rack and roll,'\" Ed said. Ed's background is in theater and film, with some design training, so entertainment became a large part of getting Mix on its feet. \"We've had theatrical readings of new works where actors came in and read their plays and people came to listen. That was the beginning of Mix Studio Theater.\" Mix Studio Theater is housed in the space just behind the store. The 40-seat black box theater is currently the home of two theater groups, The New Theater Project and Threefold Productions, who share the space. \"We always love an excuse to throw a party, offering musical groups, book signings, artist's receptions, and shopping parties. We still host events here in the store when a play opens. We use the counter as a box office, pour champagne, and have a party after opening night. We continue to do those kinds of events,\" Ed explained. With Mix running successfully, the Penets and Lelands have taken on a new project at 200 W. Michigan Avenue called Mix Marketplace. The empty shell of a failed restaurant and bar stood directly across from Mix on the busiest corner of the blossoming downtown. \"It was the worst thing to look out the windows at Mix, across the street, at a completely dark building,\" Bonnie said. When the two couples were offered an opportunity to develop the space directly across from them, they decided to accept the challenge. The concept for Mix Marketplace includes the Bona Sera Caf\u00e9 (already in operation), a wine bar, an entertainment bar, and a market for downtown shoppers meant to attract those who live in the recently developed upstairs lofts and the surrounding historic downtown neighborhoods. There are many walk-able neighborhoods in Ypsilanti, and \"we believe that every neighborhood needs its own grocery like the downtown-style, big city groceries in Manhattan,\" Leslie said. Bona Sera Caf\u00e9, the first permanent business to open, is made up of the duo Bad Fairy and Wonder Woman, two fabulous women chefs who had been hosting highly popular underground supper clubs in the Ann Arbor area for the past three years. They contacted the Penets and Lelands about coming \"above ground\" and permanently renting the restaurant space at Mix Marketplace, a more than ideal match in the eyes of the Mix team. \"Bona Sera Caf\u00e9 opened June 15 and has been very successful,\" Bonnie said. \"When we get our liquor license in the next few months, people will be able to have a glass of wine or cocktail with their dinner.\" Obtaining their liquor license will allow Mix to move forward with the final piece (at least for now) of their business. Downstairs from Bona Sera is a fully functional and fabulous bar. It is what used to be the Keystone Underground. \"There are 4,000 square feet downstairs,\" Ed said. \"There is no other space in downtown with that much room. We're not looking at opening just a bar, but an entertainment venue that would be open certain hours and would cater to blues, jazz, and variety type shows, including comedy, storytelling, theater, and film. People are hungry for something different. There are lots of places in town you can go to hear rock and roll and local bands, like Depot Town and the Tap Room, but there's no blues, no jazz, and no shows for the 30 and over crowd.\"While the Penets and Lelands are excited about what they've done and what they will be doing with their business, they're even more excited to see others come back into downtown Ypsilanti. \"Ypsilanti is a gem of a town with an educated, open-minded, diverse, and welcoming community,\" Leslie said. \"There's more space available for others to open businesses. That's what we want. We want others to come down here and help us revitalize downtown Ypsilanti. We want to continue to see it as the place where 'Cool. People. Mix.'\" \"We want others to come down here and help us revitalize downtown Ypsilanti.\" - Leslie Leland, co-owner of Mix Contined on page 22\"We always love an excuse to throw a party, offering musical groups, book signings, artist's receptions, and shopping parties.\" - Ed Penet, co-owner of Mix The concept for Mix Marketplace includes the Bona Sera Caf\u00e9 (already in operation), a wine bar, an entertainment bar, and a market for downtown shoppers... Greening Up the Environment, Strengthening the CommunityWheels In Motion DeWight Plotner, owner Wheels in Motion, (734) 971-2121; wheelsinmotion.us When you talk to DeWight Plotner, owner of Wheels In Motion, a full service bike retail and repair shop, you immediately recognize his passion for cycling. DeWight doesn't just sell bikes for a living; he's also an avid cyclist who has been riding most of his life and an idealist whose views have been shaped by his love for the sport. \"There are so many good things about cycling,\" he said. \"Cycling really is one of the best exercises you can put your body through. Like swimming, cycling is low impact and has far fewer adverse effects on the joints than many other strength building exercises. It's just good all the way around.\" While the current store, located at 3400 Washtenaw Avenue in Ann Arbor, was opened in 1988, the business has been serving the area for much longer. Farrell Plotner and Ben French, DeWight's father and uncle, founded the original company, Campus Bike & Toy, in 1933. At one point in its history there were a total of four stores: one in Brighton, one in Fenton, and two in Ann Arbor. As the needs of business changed and evolved, all but the one Ann Arbor location closed, making the business more streamlined and stable for the future. Wheels in Motion sells bikes for various kinds of cycling, including commuting, path riding, racing, and mountain biking. DeWight encourages customers to be prepared to answer a few questions when they come in looking for a new bike. He and his team can help customers narrow down the type of riding they are most interested in, get them fit to the right bike, and train them in proper riding techniques through a variety of clinics offered for riders. He explained that, once they get into it, many customers become interested in more than one bike, and that variety is part of the joy of cycling. There are times when a person wants to ride down to the local coffee shop, go out to the country with a group and ride really fast, or ride through the trails with another group. You can buy a dual-sport, hybrid or cycle-cross bike, which are multi-purpose bikes, but \"If you really want to be the most efficient in every type of riding you enjoy, you buy a bike for exactly the purpose it was designed. If you can afford to do that, you'll be better off in the long run.... There really is a difference. The mountain bike is perfectly designed for someone who wants to get on the trails, and the road bike is perfectly designed for aerodynamics and speed. Your hybrid or city bike is the one you want to hop on to ride down to the coffee shop.\" DeWight broke down several different types of cyclists for me. \"The pure commuter is the person who really is trying to use the bike instead of a car. And that's where some of the problems come in when local officials try to decide between bike paths and bike lanes. As a driver, if you were told that you could drive your car to work Leaps of Faith: Tales of Local Businesses every day, but you couldn't use the highway and it would take you more than an hour to get to work or back home, you wouldn't be too happy with that, would you? A commuter is exactly the same. They simply want to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible by using a bike. They want to be on the road, not a path.\" Next you have the cyclists who don't want to be on the roads at all or have to deal with traffic; these are the path riders. Taking the paths can be very relaxing because they are often very scenic and a really good way of becoming involved with nature. A cyclist can go at their own pace and not be worried by the noise, confusion, and hassles of road traffic. \"Right now, I'm very into riding along the river, listening to the birds and other animals. Those are the nice aspects of riding the paths.\" Finally, some people just enjoy a leisurely ride through the backstreets of neighborhoods in the community to see all the different architectural designs the neighborhood offers. \"There's a lot of different beauty depending on what you're looking for, and you can see these things better from a bike because you can slow down and coast.\" A common misconception is that riding is only a summertime sport. According to DeWight, that simply isn't true. If you really want to ride and commute all year, you can do it by layering with wind-stop garments and protecting your extremities (head, hands, and feet). \"Really, the most beautiful time to ride is in the fall with the color change. With the exception of just a few days when the conditions are icy or there's two feet of snow on the ground, you really can ride all year around. If you've ridden to work and the conditions turn too bad to ride home, use the public transit system. The Ann Arbor bus system is great because the buses have bike racks on the front for just that purpose. It allows you to promote that commuting option while reducing traffic on the roads.\" While DeWight talked to me with a calm and quiet confidence, explaining the many things he's learned about the sport he loves, his idealism became quite contagious. DeWight views bicycles as a very simple solution to many complex problems. \"If you can get people on bicycles, their health improves, the ozone layer improves, and carbon emissions are eliminated, thus decreasing our carbon footprint on the planet.\" Reflecting on cycling's potential to prevent and curb health conditions, he adds, \"I recently heard that there are now one in four children suffering with Type II diabetes. There's an explosion of health problems going on, and cycling can be part of the solution to many of those things. Fewer health issues means less money spent by government and individuals on getting healthy.\" Some local schools are beginning to jump back on the cycling bandwagon. \"For several years, many schools banned students from riding their bikes to school,\" he explained, \"but now they're beginning to designate certain routes as 'safe' for students to ride.\" Some Ann Arbor schools have also started mountain biking clubs. That's exciting for the team at Wheels In Motion because they're \"always looking for groups to organize with and ways to promote cycling, especially for kids.\" Wheels In Motion created Tour De Kid, a marathon developed specifically for kids as a way Contined from page 21 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 22 DeWight doesn't just sell bikes for a living; he's also an avid cyclist who has been riding most of his life and an idealist whose views have been shaped by his love for the sport. \"There's a lot of different beauty depending on what you're looking for, and you can see these things better from a bike because you can slow down and coast.\" - DeWight Plotner, owner of Wheels in Motion While every retailer has felt the crunch of the recession over the last several years, DeWight has perhaps felt that crunch a little less.... In fact, as many businesses have been forced to cut back, Wheels In Motion is set to expand in the coming year.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 23 of introducing them to the sport of cycling at a young age. \"The younger we can introduce them, the better. It's a fun event that will hopefully encourage them to exercise and be active for a lifetime.\" This year, the Ann Arbor Bicycling Society is teaming up with Wheels In Motion for the Tour De Kid event and will be able to provide an ongoing community resource for those who desire to continue riding into their adulthood years. With schools coming back on board with cycling, there is a continuity of cycling from youth through adulthood. As an avid cyclist, DeWight rides the trails as well as many of the roads throughout Ann Arbor and the surrounding area and is constantly reminded that safety is the primary issue for any cyclist. \"I really feel like we're looked on as second-class citizens,\" DeWight said. \"Motorists don't show us the respect we wish they would. Many refuse to share the road, including the bike lane. Often times they speed up and crowd the bike lane so the biker can't get through, or so that they can pass the biker. I'm really not sure they realize how dangerous it is if an automobile comes in contact with a biker. I often feel that I'm little more than an irritation to them. I wish they'd just stop and think, if I even touch this person with my car, there could be life-altering implications.\" While there are several roads in Ann Arbor that have bike lanes, DeWight believes that every road should have one. Though local governments often say that money isn't available to add bike lanes, they are setting aside money to repair roads, and DeWight suggests that they slightly extend the roads that are already under repair to make them safer for cyclists. \"Doing just that would open the roads for more people to commute to work, to the grocery store, or to downtown.... That just means less traffic congestion on the streets, which is a cost-saving factor in the long run when it comes to maintenance and repairs, and it opens up parking in downtown and other high traffic areas.\" On top of that, there is the personal savings for that person who has opted to bike rather than drive. While every retailer has felt the crunch of the recession over the last several years, DeWight has perhaps felt that crunch a little less. \"It's a little different in the biking industry. It's interesting because as the price of gas has risen over the last few years, so has the sale of bicycles. It's just a given in an economic situation where people are trying to find money-saving ways to travel.\" Wheels In Motion created Tour De Kid, a marathon developed specifically for kids as a way of introducing them to the sport of cycling at a young age. In fact, as many businesses have been forced to cut back, Wheels In Motion is set to expand in the coming year. With a staff of 12 during peak volume, including both of his children, Travis and Chelsie, the store will be moving one retail space over into what is currently the Naked Furniture space. \"It is more square footage and will give us more floor space for bikes and accessories,\" DeWight explained. \"And Trek [a primary bike brand carried in-store] is considering us as one of their concept stores, which just means they will offer us more dealer support and guidance in the future. I'm considering it, but, at the same time, we've really worked hard over the decades to build our image and reputation within this community, and we're really set on maintaining that image while being able to offer our customers further support.\" The staff people at Wheels in Motion have become known as ambassadors for cycling. \"We promote cycling, whether it's leisure cycling, commuting, or racing. We want you to be comfortable coming into our store and we want to help you get out on the roads and trails.\" ### Green Living The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 24 Manifesting a Dream Job ~ How DIY Culture, Etsy, and Ingenuity Helped a Local Couple Find Their Place in the Global Market Story and Photos by Rachel Pastiva You've probably noticed by now that we're in the middle of a Great Awakening\u2014 one that affects the very foundations that society is built upon: food systems, money systems, political systems. People everywhere are discovering they are no longer content with the status quo, and are willing to do something about it. As people begin shifting their money to local financial institutions and vegetable gardens continue to pop up in backyards across the country, a new creative movement is transforming the way people spend money, and what they do to earn it. The concept of DIY (Do-It-Yourself) is not a new one, but it's no secret that over the past few years it has gained a momentum that is unprecedented in our modern history. From \"Stitch 'n' Bitch\" circles and craft fairs to Make magazine and Instructables.com, the idea of making something yourself is entering the minds of more and more would-be consumers, and inspiring people to question the quality and function of mass-produced products. No place is the rise in handmade products more evident than in the continued success of Etsy.com, the online marketplace for all things handmade and vintage.Since 2005, Etsy's goal has been to reconnect makers with buyers, give artists a chance to make a living doing their craft and, in the end, hopefully build a new economy by doing so. As it exists today, Etsy is a launch pad for makers of all things creative and innovative, not just artists, and has given a local couple a chance to make a living doing what they love. Operating out of their home in Ypsilanti, partners in business and in life, 30-somethings Jeff Risinger and Mark Winn began selling wares on Etsy in 2009, Owning their own business has taught Mark and Jeff valuable lessons...\"It's shown me that there are many different avenues beyond the traditional to achieving your goals in life. What you can visualize, you can materialize,\" says Jeff. Mark's sister, Jessica, had been selling handpicked vintage clothing for years [on Etsy]. \"I saw that she was doing something that she had passion for \u2014 she woke up in the morning happy to be doing what she was doing. Even though she wasn't making a lot of money, she was making a living, and I thought it would be worth it to me to just make a living doing something I love.\" Artisans Mark Winn & Jeff RisingerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 25 as a hobby to supplement their incomes. Mark's sister, Jessica, had been selling handpicked vintage clothing for years in her Etsy \"shop\" called Lola Vintage, and this inspired Mark to give Etsy a try. \"I saw that she was doing something that she had passion for \u2014 she woke up in the morning happy to be doing what she was doing. Even though she wasn't making a lot of money, she was making a living, and I thought it would be worth it to me to just make a living doing something I love.\" Jeff also dreamed of doing something different with his life: working for himself. While working part-time at a video rental store, Jeff became acquainted with a customer who hired him to do yard work, and later to be his full-time personal assistant. \"Working for Dale helped me realize I had the skills to run a business. I had a lot of freedom while working for him and his wife...I basically ran their household. I did everything from laundry, to gardening, to tax prep, to roofing. I really enjoyed the variety of tasks involved and being able to work at my own pace. I realized that I could work for myself and have that same freedom in my workdays. Not having to punch in somewhere is a beautiful thing.\" Jeff and Mark established an online shop on Etsy and named it BootsNGus, after two of their cats. In the beginning, the shop sold vintage housewares that Mark enjoyed collecting. \"We were selling vintage dishes, vintage garden planters, and vintage home decor. It's extremely fun for me to find a vintage set of dishes or an antique planter somewhere that I know will be loved again by one of our customers,\" Mark says. Mark's passion for housewares began at a very young age. \"[It] definitely stems from growing up in the late 1970s and my mother's tastes...She had Tupperware parties and I used to be fascinated by all the colors and shapes. Our home was full of beautiful housewares from the fifties, sixties, and seventies,\" Mark says. \"Most of those pieces were bought at tag sales or garage sales or second-hand stores. My parents are both avid 'salers'. They love a bargain, and I've been treasure-hunting with them since I was born.\" Mark and Jeff added some homemade items to their shop when Jeff began sewing pillows and coasters. The more he made, the more inspired he became. \"The more I focused on my creations, the more I desperately wanted to provide people with something unique and different.\" In the first year of business, the shop brought in a few thousand dollars \u2014 not enough to allow Mark and Jeff to realize their dreams. Mark remembers, \"When we had so many housewares that they were taking up valuable space in our house, Jeff said, 'If we want to move these, why don't we try to make them into something other than what they are?' \" Mark credits nostalgia for part of the attraction. \"Who doesn't have some retro Tupperware in their house, in their basement, stuck in some cupboard somewhere?...[And] how ubiquitous is a Mason jar? Everywhere you go, there are Mason jars. So the idea to upcycle them was modern and vintage at the same time.\" Continued on page 26 Spiritual Clearings Sacred Practices to Release Negative Energy and Harmonize Your Life by Diana Burney, RN, BSN, M.Ed SpiritualClearings.com An Award Winning blend of spiritual and practical material, Spiritual Clearings, offers a comprehensive checklist of situations that may require a personal, home, property, or business Clearing; from feeling \"stuck\" in life, to selling a home.

I noticed that no one had done anything.\" (\"Upcycling\" is defined as turning reused materials into products of better quality or a higher environmental value.) \"So I said, 'I'm going to do it.' That night, I put a cord through some Tupperware, hooked it up, filmed it, and listed it within an hour, because I was so hyper. It went from being a seven-dollar Jello mold to a thirty-five-dollar light.\" Though this was the first light Jeff made for BootsNGus, the process wasn't new to him. \"I've always been interested in upcycled lighting. I've been making my own lights out of found materials since I was in high school. I remember looking up ways Manifesting a Dream Job ~ to recycle and to reduce the amount of trash I threw away,\" Jeff says. \"We had so much vintage Tupperware and antique Mason jars and old Pyrex bowls. Making them into lights and giving them new lives seemed like a great idea.\" From there, the Tupperware lighting took off. Mark credits nostalgia for part of the attraction. \"Who doesn't have some retro Tupperware in their house, in their basement, stuck in some cupboard somewhere? Tupperware is great, but you can only put so many leftovers away.\" Jeff created more lights and began working with Mason jars, another item Mark thinks people easily connect with. \"How ubiquitous is a Mason jar? Everywhere you go, there are Mason jars. So the idea to upcycle them was modern and vintage at the same time.\" Upcycling housewares into lighting and, more specifically, upcycling Mason jars, was the key to helping Jeff and Mark realize their dreams. Jeff left his job in the fall of 2010 to devote his time fully to their Etsy shop. In March of 2011, as demand for their lights increased, Mark quit his job, and Jeff could finally say he makes a living working for himself. From chandeliers to sconces, pendant lights to outdoor solar lighting, Mason jar lighting has become BootsNGus's most popular product line. Mark and Jeff have shipped their lights to every state in the country, as well as many countries in Europe. They've shipped to places as diverse as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Turkey, Malaysia, South Korea, South Africa, and Brazil. \"We've had many restaurants and bars purchase our products,\" says Mark. \"We've sold to many shops and boutiques, from coffee and tea shops to shoe stores, to bed and breakfasts. Pixar studios purchased from us. A couple of television shows have purchased from us for sets.\" In addition to selling their products worldwide, they have been featured in various media outlets. \"We've been in a few magazines including Natural Home & Garden, Better Homes & Gardens , Country Living , Flea Market Style, and House & Home Canada . We've been in many blogs and online magazines. One of our favorites was an Italian online newspaper. We couldn't understand the article, but we were very pleased!\" says Mark. \"Our work will be featured on an ABC television show this holiday season. We aren't allowed to discuss details yet, but we're very excited to see our lights on prime-time TV!\" Owning their own business has taught Mark and Jeff valuable lessons. For Jeff, it's been a reminder that anything is possible when you put your mind to it. \"It's shown me that there are many different avenues beyond the traditional to achieving your goals in life. What you can visualize, you can materialize.\" \"I make it a point to support local and small businesses every chance I get. Owning our own business has shown me how important our contribution to our local economy really is. I feel a deeper connection to our community.\" Continued from page 25 Jeff began sewing pillows and coasters. The more he made, the more inspired he became. \"The more I focused on my creations, the more I desperately wanted to provide people with something unique and different.\" \"That night, I put a cord through some Tupperware, hooked it up, filmed it, and listed it within an hour, because I was so hyper. It went from being a seven- dollar Jello mold to a thirty-five-dollar light.\" For Mark, the experience has changed his perspective on his role as a consumer. \"I have become much more responsible with where and how I spend my money. I make it a point to support local and small businesses every chance I get. Owning our own business has shown me how important our contribution to our local economy really is. I feel a deeper connection to our community.\" Both credit Etsy as a catalyst for the changes happening among consumers. \"Spending just a few minutes on Etsy can inspire one to want to support handmade. Etsy has everything you could need for your home \u2014 millions of awesome items. Etsy has changed people's buying habits by offering a bounty of quality goods made by hand, not made by a large conglomerate. Even the vintage side of Etsy is changing the way people buy. It's a wonderful way to recycle!\" says Jeff. \"Etsy has given consumers another choice. Many of our customers tell us that they don't want to buy from large chains and would rather support handmade,\" adds Mark. \"Etsy is also very easy and convenient. Shopping online is great for busy people.\" For those who want to support handmade items locally, Etsy even offers an option to search for items by location. In a time when chain stores are closing, Etsy gives artists a chance to grow their businesses. It has given Jeff and Mark the foundation they need to continue to explore new ideas for their lighting and expand to more markets. They are working on launching their own website, BootsNGus.com, and hope to someday open a brick-and-mortar store. While they are grateful for the opportunity they've had to build a business, Jeff isn't surprised at what it has become. \"I always knew I would work for myself. I always knew I would run my own business. I worked really hard to manifest my dream. I didn't let circumstance get in my way. I kept my eye on the goal. I'm lucky to have a partner who shares that drive. When we decided to make this business work, we knew that it would. There was never any doubt for us. It was just a matter of time.\" Mark Winn was born and raised in Alma, Michigan; Jeff Risinger in Jackson, Michigan. They have been together for five years.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 27 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 28 The Soul's Progress: Thoughts on Reincarnation and the Akashic Records Maureen McMahon Explores Often Uncharted Territory and Speaks to Renowned Metaphysician and Local Author John Friedlander about the Soul's Progress By Maureen McMahon Photos by Joni Strickfaden The rungs of a redwood tree. Al Gore reading ice cores in Antarctica. The anthropologist who discovered the Lucy remains combing the Afar Depression, decoding cliffs of sediment. All tell a dynamic history. The redwood seed was planted; the conditions were maybe a forest in Marin, foggy, late afternoon light. A small grove for many centuries gained a tree, just as a long and detailed history, in which all affects all, played out. The rungs of the stump attest to drought, disease, fire, and flood. They tell a linear (concentric, if you will) narrative, yet point to a dynamic history. Now consider your hair. Consider how fluctuations in hormones, emotions, and conditions are evidenced in how your hair grows moment to moment. A lock could tell your story. Catalogs of information are being naturally recorded all around us, yet, when it comes to our individual histories, we tend to be more comfortable thinking about how the human mind intentionally inputs items into various catalogs, as opposed to it happening passively, subconsciously. I could tell you a child was born. The conditions were Arizona, summer, teenaged parents, a good school district, a bad relationship. And that would be a snippet of the story, a fragment of narrative that could never encompass the whole. If you were that child, you would most definitely want there to be more to that story. As we form our narratives, we relish the intention and editorial choices involved in telling anecdotes, writing diaries, building monuments, or, as is the tendency in the modern world, using the Internet to record aspects of how we were here. Through a torrent of zeroes and ones, our blogs unfold, our social media pages update, and our emails come and go. When we publish our individual histories on the web, they take on a dynamic life beyond the page of a diary \u2014 a process that is closer to the truth of our dynamic nature. Just as each book in each library used to have a static record, a Dewey Decimal Number, now with the Internet, the life of that book has changed; encoded within its reference tags are fast portals to thousands of other possibilities. As we evolve and our systems for interpretation evolve, we are differently aware of interrelatedness, exchange, and dynamic progressions. We've become accustomed to rapid progress and rely on the way technology connects narratives. Of course, the narrative process is also inherent. We talk about getting older. We see our children growing up, our towns changing and the decades settling into their legacies, and it feels linear. Yet, as we age, our personal legacies change with our memory of them and our decisions of how to frame memory. It is a subjective catalog, gloriously encouraged to change. The question then is, could there be something apart from our narratives and our memory that thoroughly catalogs the events of our lives? Something unbiased, containing stories about us we maybe weren't aware of before, stories that can aid in processing our progress. It is a catalog that is naturally being recorded all around us; it relies on our human love of narrative, utilizing it as a transaction through which we come to understand our true selves and our true potentials; it blends history as a helpful concept with the reality that time is not linear; it is a catalog that is always in flux. Sound unlikely or confusing? To begin, I'd like you to imagine a seismograph recording the fluctuations of the Earth's internal rumblings, not just during the Japanese quake but during all events. Imagine Louis Armstrong's \"West End Blues\" being recorded in 1928, the oscillations in sound from his trumpet carving a vinyl groove, its broadcast making history. Now imagine an experiential body of knowledge recording everything that every soul has ever thought, said, and done over the course of its eternal existence, as well as all its future possibilities. The result is a record of raw events related to each soul that can be accessed by an individual or by a person on behalf of that individual Each human has co-personalities that share the same eternal soulThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 29 and interacted with through meditation, dialogue, imagery, impressions, emotional or physical feelings, and downloading and uploading \u2014 all in a process intended to bring further insight about the soul's progress. It may sound strange, but the existence of such a catalog is recognized by many of the major spiritual traditions. In the Judeo-Christian tradition it is known as both \"The Book of Life\" and \"The Book of God's Remembrance.\" In Egyptian history it's referred to as \"The Hall of Records.\" Moreover, metaphysical students know of it as a plane of consciousness called the \"Akashic Records.\" Before we get into how this catalog could exist and what we can learn from it, we need to dig into the concept of reincarnation. To many, reincarnation is a spiritual belief held by some and not a reality. It seems intricate, unlikely, and uncomfortable. Others say you may not believe in reincarnation but you will participate in it. To them, it feels natural, logical, and obvious. For the purposes of this exploration into the topic of the Akashic Records, as I will be calling it, we need to consider that reincarnation is real. For many of us, life is too full and our knowing too intact for us to have achieved our highest thought starting at year one and ending at death. We go somewhere new and feel like we've been there before. We meet our future spouse at a party and just know this person was meant to be with us, feeling instantly that we've somehow picked up where we left off. We ask ourselves, if I did not have the conditions in place to experience such events in this lifetime, how do I know so much about this? These feelings of knowingness seem to defy our linear catalog of events. They even stick out in our minds as extraordinary...as the day my life's trajectory changed...as the day I won the legal settlement and felt a wave of justice cresting, feeling more meaningful than my personal drama...or when I finally made the trek up that mountain that had long called to me...or that small gesture that felt like it completed something bigger than myself. According to many of the world's religions and spiritual traditions, when we become aware of these shifts in our emotional compass, it is our eternal soul revealing its progress to us. You'll find this in Hindu traditions, as well as similar notions of evolving consciousness in Tibetan Buddhism, Kabbalah, and Jainism, to name a few. Common among these traditions is an expectation that people should strive to become more aware of the dance of karma; to be self-reflective, but also to see it moving slow and fast, leading to minor adjustments and broad restorative justice, and always pointing to the reality that life is not linear, time is not linear. Through the lens of reincarnation, you are a person experiencing life through a particular personality, but versions of your eternal soul have incarnated many times. This concept of \"you\" as a soul reincarnating as various personalities living during many lifetimes helps explain how we get to our knowing, what our life's purpose is, what we've come to complete, and how we hope to evolve. While we think of reincarnation as a linear progression of past lives resulting in one's current lifetime, it's more complex than that, with simultaneity and probabilities always at play. So how can we understand reincarnation more clearly? How can the catalog of the Akashic Records help us understand it? These are the questions that directed my study of the Akashic Records. These were also the first questions I asked during a long phone conversation in January with John Friedlander, a well known intuitive, author, and psychic teacher who resides here in southeast Michigan. John teaches his students how to interact with the Akashic Records in his master classes and through our conversation and correspondence, he gave me a much fuller understanding of reincarnation and the Akashic Records than I received from the basic resources I consulted. The following is an exploration of what I learned. The texts I consulted were How to Read the Akashic Records (2006) by Linda Howe and portions of The Seth Material compiled by Jane Roberts, an American woman whose work channeling an entity called Seth became the foundation for much metaphysical inquiry since the 1970s. My hope is that these explorations will be thought provoking and enticing. Some of these concepts will be a reach for many \u2014 and, I must admit, though he is very skilled at explaining these concepts, interacting with John's ideas felt like going down the wormhole at times. Still, I think it's valuable to be exposed to these ideas and fascinating to contemplate our origins and the nature of the soul's progress. I can only sketch the scope of John's practices and believe that by doing your own study and/or training with him and doing the psychic exercises that build skills with these concepts would allow you both to understand and use them fruitfully. As I stated before, the Akashic Records are an experiential body of knowledge recording everything that every soul has ever thought, said, and done over the course of its eternal existence, as well as all its future possibilities. Records also exist for buildings, towns, eras, animals, and so on. The medium for this recording is the Akashic plane, a central, neutral plane of creation that interconnects all others and contains akasha, a Sanskrit word that means \"the primary substance.\" According to Linda Howe, the akasha is so sensitive that the slightest vibrations of an ether register an indelible impression upon it. As the akasha vibrates, what takes form are the Akashic Records, a light body of universal self-awareness and a dimension of consciousness that contains a vibrational record of every soul and its journey. Here can be accessed an archive of each soul as it has existed from lifetime to lifetime as different human beings on the earth plane while evolving through time and space. In Howe's description, these Records are governed by non-physical light beings, called the Lords of the Records, who work with a human's Masters, Teachers, and Loved Ones by \"downloading\" to them the information they will relay during an Akashic Reading. The Lords and the entities they communicate with are, in essence, mediators of information, only providing to a person or the reader who's working on his or her behalf focused excerpts that would be helpful to know. The question then is, could there be something apart from our narratives and our memory that thoroughly catalogs the events of our lives? When people discuss near death experiences, they describe their whole life flashing before their eyes. That's all their information being uploaded into the Akashic Records.As the akasha vibrates, what takes form are the Akashic Records, a light body of universal self-awareness and a dimension of consciousness that contains a vibrational record of every soul and its journey. \"After you die, what you do with your Akashic Records, is you take it out of its linear order. Like modern music samplings. You create whole new riffs and whole new different understandings...you start seeing other choices you could have made...it's really quite glorious.\" - John FriedlanderJohn Friedlander Continued on Page 30 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 30 So let me take us back to this Dewey Decimal concept of knowledge. Metaphorically each soul has a Dewey Decimal Number in an eternal library that is managed by librarians who regulate what information can be accessed and is open to the public 24 hours a day. In Linda Howe's process to access the Akashic Records, a soul's Dewey Decimal Number is their current legal name, and there is a \"Pathway Prayer\" process she has channeled to help anyone access the Records. Why go into the Records? Among many reasons are to ask questions and to learn about yourself or to receive information to be shared with others. Howe writes, \"Accessing the Record can be extremely valuable. Your soul's very essence and expression, potential, and purposes can be seen. The Records can be a tool to assist you in manifesting your own Life Purpose.\" The information stored there is raw, in that the Records show events exactly as they were experienced, and these events are not clarified, understood, and assimilated until a consciousness takes responsibility for doing so. Once it is fully assimilated, it is stored on the Akashic plane. Howe's book provides a useful background of the Akashic Records and is a practical guide for how to explore them. She suggests a person accessing the Akashic Records should ask questions beginning with how, why, and what; whereas time related, predictive questions and yes or no questions are unreliable and are to be avoided. She also states some guidelines for going into the Records, like avoiding drugs and alcohol, grounding yourself after the reading, getting permission from others to access their Record, remaining confidential about what is exchanged, and not opening the Records of people under age 18.I used Linda Howe's Pathway Prayer process to explore the Akashic Records on my own for about six months. While still a novice, I got some fascinating results and would recommend anyone try it. Among the most revealing experiences I had occurred when I went into a friend's Record with her permission and got a powerful feeling that I was interacting with her soul's plan or higher self. I physically felt like I accelerated north and entered a very loving space. I was able to calmly write down the information I received and she claims it was helpful for her to read. When I shared my ideas and impressions with John Friedlander, he expressed that the processes that go on around the Akashic Records are very complex and that this is a very confusing topic, one that he's learned about through studying with Jane Roberts herself in 1974, and from reading The Seth Material and her other books, as well as from his own clairvoyant explorations and channeling. I might point out, too, that to access the Records, John does not use any certain prayer process. He told me that you can find your Akashic Records many places, but that typically he does it by focusing his awareness about a foot above the crown chakra, a place often called the Soul Star. When we spoke on the phone, John patiently began by pointing out that the Akashic Records are not just a hall of records, but are intrinsically creative, and even include what could have happened as well as what did; that is, they include probable realities too. This is why predictive questions don't work; they can't take into account the dynamic nature of probabilities in flux. He explained that everything that could happen does happen. There are alternate worlds where you've taken different choices. And in those worlds, this \"you\" here is the probable self, and \"they\" are to themselves the real self. In the deepest sense, everything happens simultaneously. And even though it's happening simultaneously, at every point in time, it's being consciously reborn in time. So every moment recorded therein is nevertheless still happening and continuing to change, which doesn't fit into our linear consciousness. To illustrate this, he described how a meeting in a dream he had some decades ago changed the life experience of a woman in the Victorian era: \"During a dream while I was studying with Seth, I met a woman who was a past incarnation of mine from the Victorian era. When she saw me in the dream, she was shocked and put her hand over her mouth \u2014 because she had seen this male part of herself. When she went to sleep, in line with Seth's teachings, she hadn't yet met this male aspect of herself. When she woke up, my past Victorian incarnation was different than she had been before she went to sleep. It wasn't until she went to sleep that she met her future self, me; and it wasn't until I went to sleep that she, my past self, changed. When I awoke, my past \u2014 her \u2014 had changed. Thus, my Akashic Records of my past life were different when I woke than they had been when I went to sleep the night before. Akashic Records change over time.\" He added, \"All consciousness expands in all directions, and your Akashic Records are a form of consciousness, just as you are. When we work with them, we work with them very dynamically.\" He suggested that updating your Akashic Records can be done often to great benefit. When he and his advanced students finish a workshop, they almost always take some time to upload the information into the Akashic Records, and then download a copy of all the information that's relevant into their bodies, auras, and in particular chakras. Thus, their Akashic Records are up to date and are more available to their soul to help them make life plans, and the information relevant to everyday life is right there in the body and aura so it can be used. Most people don't update their Akashic Records during their lifetime. For them, their whole life's updating occurs upon death. This is why, when people discuss near death experiences, they describe their whole life flashing before their eyes. That's all their information being uploaded into the Akashic Records. John explained that anyone can update their Records consciously \u2014 by accessing them and \"sorting them out.\" \"After you die, what you do with your Akashic Records, is you take it out of its linear order. Like modern music samplings. You create whole new riffs and whole new different understandings...you start seeing other choices you could have made...it's really quite glorious.\" The Soul's Progress: Thoughts on Reincarnation and the Akashic Records Maureen McMahon Explores Often Uncharted Territory and Speaks to Renowned Metaphysician and Local Author John Friedlander about the Soul's Progress Continued from Page 29 \"As humans, we can do healings with a co-personality and complete issues and it makes a pretty dramatic change in the aura. Its issues are your issues. It gave birth to you.\" -John FriedlanderImagine an experiential body of knowledge recording everything that every soul has ever thought, said, and done over the course of its eternal existence, as well as all its future possibilities. While we think of reincarnation as a linear progression of past lives resulting in one's current lifetime, it's more complex than that, with simultaneity and probabilities always at play.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 31 Even though we can update our Records consciously and sort them out, people are generally uncomfortable with exploring alternate probabilities as they relate to their lives. \"Seeing probabilities in dreams can be overwhelming. People wonder, 'What am I guilty of? What can I take pride in?'\" \u2014 and so, when he was studying with Jane Roberts in her group, they backed off exploring probabilities, even though \"Seth told us that exploring them could be thrilling...It changes your relationship to experience when you really start to understand that you've taken multiple paths in your various probabilities, and each is sacred and adds to life expanding in all directions. It took me decades to return to probabilities with a deeper understanding, though now my students and I find our psychic explorations of different probabilities to be both reasonably easy and life changing. \"Within your everyday life you'll have goals, things you like and things you don't like, but understanding this richness that all life expands in all directions \u2014 it gives you a kind of openness and playfulness; a lack of fear, judgment, and resistance. You are moving to a more synchronistic universe and away from your understanding of a causal one.\" In response to Linda Howe's description of \"the Lords of the Records,\" he noted that all form is held together by consciousness, and that the Akashic Records are a consciousness, not just a place. These \"Lords\" are form beings related to a whole chain of evolution called the Deva chain (Deva being a Hindu word for deity), which the Western traditions call an angelic chain. The chain runs parallel to the human animal chain we understand, though their consciousnesses are necessary to support our lives. He recommends the movie City of Angels (1998) for a metaphoric explanation of a certain level of Devas who don't have the self-reflective ego that humans do. He also said about Devas, \"They are pretty much at the same level as humans, but are of a very different consciousness. They tend to move spontaneously towards what is right the way a plant moves naturally towards light. They can't engage in the kind of stories that we engage with, they are different, and neither form of consciousness is better.\" These keepers streamline information in such a way that you can focus on one probability. Each probable view would have one bank of Akashic Records. To clarify the meaning of the Masters, Teachers, and Loved Ones who are said to govern the Akashic Records, he said, \"I don't use that terminology. Many beings collaborate to support human consciousness. Those 'Lords of the Records' include beings who order time and space in conjunction with the way that humanity currently experiences time, and the 'Masters' and so on work with the Lords to facilitate our use of the Records during and after our lives. At a certain level all these so-called Lords and Masters are exercising judgment, but not so much as a king exercises judgment with whimsicality. The very nature of human consciousness depends on our way of having time and they maintain that structure and our use of it. I like to say time is a way to keep everything from happening at once. They are just a part of that nature, these beings. The Devic Lords are just of a different chain of evolution.\" Working from this metaphor of a library or bank of shared information, he added, \"The whole thing is a system. The simplest definition of a system is that when you take action at any part of the system, the whole system is affected.\" So your Records can be distorted \"by people adding or subtracting information; by people taking your information for their own purposes, or by your giving it away. What you can do in part of your work is you can go back and collect any information of yours that's elsewhere. You don't have to rip it out of their grip. If they're using it constructively, you can let them keep it and make a copy of it.\" At this point in our conversation, without pausing and much to my delight, John described how he was currently accessing the Akashic Records: \"I don't think I've sorted out my Records in a year and a half. Now that I'm talking to you, so now as we are talking, I'm sorting out my Records. One of my family members has a strong opinion of what I should be doing with my life, and my family member is, quite unconsciously, poking their finger in my Akashic Records, and so I'm doing what's called becoming neutral, in which I'm acknowledging my family member has an opinion and then I withdraw my energy from their space. When I've done so, that family member can no longer affect my Records because only my resistance gave them traction there in the first place.\" Before we talked, I had read John's chapter on co-personalities in his recent book, Psychic Psychology: Energy Skills for Life and Relationships (2011), which had given me more insight into reincarnation. In it, he emphasizes how \"past\" lives happen simultaneously and that each human has co-personalities that share the same eternal soul. When we spoke, he elaborated that, \"When you die, you can work together with your other incarnations as a collective to 'seed' or plan a new future life. It isn't just your next life; it's the next life for each of the participating incarnations. This process is a new idea \u2014 you each participate in this next life your collective is seeding. You participate from a psychic platform that forms part of the new life's unconscious mind.\" I told him that after reading his descriptions of a soul's co-personalities, the imagery it brought to my mind was of fingers leading to a hand, to a wrist, then to an arm \u2014 the co-personalities being the fingers working together, and the eternal soul uniting them as the wrist and arm. Working with my metaphor, he laughed warmly, For many of us, life is too full and our knowing too intact for us to have achieved our highest thought starting at year one and ending at death. Continued on Page 32 I then asked him if you could use your mind to communicate with your soul's other co-personalities. He replied that there is another use of the term co-personalities more related to this, which he describes as \"a psychic platform that's attached and my other co-personalities are ensconced in it.\" To elaborate the point, he used the example of his good friend Will, a man who studied with him and Jane Roberts in John's current lifetime, died decades ago, and is one of John's co-personalities. \"Will participates in his experience from his own center, but also in mine. Will can participate from his own consciousness. Will is helping me grow my equanimity. It's not second hand, my experience, to Will; it's a direct but different experience. Like the audience watching a basketball game. They are there, interacting as part of the crowd, seeing it as it unfolds.\" Additionally, \"The soul has it's own psychic platforms called 'permanent seeds' that act as mediating stations between you and the Akashic Records. There are three of them.\" Why would a personality seed a new incarnation and participate in that incarnation as a co-personality? \"You die, and eventually you really need new experience from another incarnation. So you seed a new incarnation, collaborating with other incarnations from your soul who also are no longer alive. The soul also takes part in that collaboration in the new incarnation from a much higher energy. You hang out with that new incarnation from your little platform, interact with its new experiences; it's not like you're a passive recipient of its experience. You feed back through the new incarnation's subconscious your own responses to its experiences.\" He added, \"The living personality can bring in new co-personalities as its personality changes. Co-personalities don't have to stay for the whole lifespan.\" This interplay is partly why a personality undergoes a dramatic change; the co-personality completes what it needed and clears out, allowing a new co-personality to interact. It's why you see that some people have such distinct chapters in their life and seem like they are \"a different person\" when they begin a new chapter. An example might be someone who battles severe addiction and recovers from it. When John explained this to me, it was a real revelation, helping me to understand why people might take such unexpected and, in the end, profound detours. It helps explain this yearning we have regarding the question of what do we need to complete.Author Linda Howe and her book , How to Read the Akashic Records : Accessing the Archive of the Soul and Its Journey Linda Howe is the founder and director of the Center for Akashic Studies, and the leading expert in the field of Akashic Studies. Specializing in the use of the Akashic Records for personal empowerment and consciousness development, she has successfully taught thousands of people to work in the Records as a spiritual practice since 1996. Widely regarded as a gifted teacher, Linda Howe is known for making spiritual ideas understandable and useful in the daily lives of her students, enabling them to experience the growth and transformation they seek.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 32 saying it's more like three hands, and then explained that, \"At the causal level, each incarnation has its own soul, and is in constant, though usually unconscious, contact with that soul. The incarnation, that is you, your personality, also continues further up the arm in that it shares experiences with a broader group-shared soul, and up more to an ever broader sharing, until you get seven small levels up, where you share experiences with the whole human race.\" When I asked him if you could run into one of your co-personalities on the street, he replied that, yes, you can meet your counterparts. Jane Roberts was a counterpart of Rob, her husband, and a counterpart of her best friend, and about 10 other people who studied with her. At one frequency level they have distinct souls, but one significant step higher in frequency they share a soul. He added that, \"That's another thing that affects Akashic Records, because, from just one point of view, they just have the information from that one life, but from another, they have all information from you and your counterparts.\" \"Often your bitterest rivals will be your counterpart. Incarnating as counterparts is how you experience the richness of that time frame. You can't understand the 21 st century as just an intellectual female who lives here. If you really want to understand an issue or the 21st century, this whole group, almost like a team, will go in to understand...maybe how to get the notion of the physical body. One might be an athlete, one might be paralyzed to understand that, one might be a doctor, one might have 15 children \u2014 to really explore all the things a body can do and not do.\" \"One group might want to explore the politics of the age, in one country, or throughout the globe. People born in the forties and fifties might have wanted to explore gender issues; one person might be gay, one a very promiscuous male or female, or a monk. Or explore it through classes; one a poor mother, one a Park Avenue mother, one person might join an eco forum, one might be Gloria Steinem. The real story is there is this proliferation of stories going on with all the others.\" The Soul's Progress: Thoughts on Reincarnation and the Akashic Records Maureen McMahon Explores Often Uncharted Territory and Speaks to Renowned Metaphysician and Local Author John Friedlander about the Soul's Progress Continued from Page 31 \"Within your everyday life you'll have goals, things you like and things you don't like, but understanding this richness that all life expands in all directions \u2014 it gives you a kind of openness and playfulness; a lack of fear, judgment, and resistance.

In The Seth Material, Seth often talks about Jane's incarnations and I wondered if Seth accesses the Akashic Records to do this. John replied, \"Seth sees everything simultaneously.\" I should have guessed. He added, \"I do past life readings by picking up the energy in people's auras. Some people differentiate doing an aura reading and checking the reading by getting 'the truth' from the Akashic Records. My concern is what's happening in the aura. Reading co-personalities' interactions is also very helpful. As humans, we can do healings with a co-personality and complete issues and it makes a pretty dramatic change in the aura. Its issues are your issues. It gave birth to you. It's not that you have to suffer because your soul chooses this life. This doesn't fit into linear time. Before you even exist in time, you, the personality that you eventually become, actually chooses to be born or not into the particular circumstances of your family.\" I hung up the phone pretty awestruck. Could it be that I'm a finger dancing on a hand, synchronizing with my many co-personalities to evolve our soul? Sounds probable to me \u2014 and after taking a few months to explore the Akashic Records, even likely. Doing this exploration has taken me out of my linear, causal, self-reflective narrative and opened my mind to the possibilities beyond. I agree with John that when you go after the richness that comes from understanding that all life expands in all directions, you approach a lack of fear, judgment, and resistance, and feel openness and playfulness in their place. Reincarnation and the Akashic Records are often uncharted territory, though well worth exploring for yourself.

A big, beefy guy? A wizened old man who knows all the short cuts and back roads? You may be surprised to find that a slight, soft-spoken, middle-aged woman with attentive blue eyes can offer just the expertise you need. After all, diving headlong into the void, the abyss of consciousness, the great unknown of the divine is exactly that kind of adventure. Travelers on this path who have Mary Anne Perrone as their spiritual guide count themselves fortunate for she offers a most profound quality indeed \u2014 presence. Mary Anne comes to this career as a spiritual guide after a range of life experience. She spent about 12 years cumulatively as a special education and bilingual teacher at the elementary and middle school levels, not including time off to raise her two boys, do community organizing, and live overseas doing social justice and Latin American solidarity work. From 2000-2005, she was the founding principal of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a small middle school for girls in southwest Detroit. In addition to her career in education and being a mom, Mary Anne has been a non- stop activist for peace and justice issues for over thirty years. Inspired by her own spirituality and faith, she has worked extensively with the Interfaith Council for Peace Mary Anne Perrone ~ Spiritual Guide, Anam Cara And with a delightfully ready sense of humor, she can share a belly laugh as easily as a prayerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 35 and Justice in Ann Arbor focusing on Latin America and other peace and justice issues, including nuclear disarmament and putting an end to world hunger, torture, and war. When asked how she got so involved in global social justice work and why she has kept at it for more than 30 years, Mary Anne tells the following story: In 1979, I took my very first trip to Latin America to be part of a group holding dialogues with the native people affected by oppressive, dictatorial regimes and extreme poverty. There was a simple quote on a poster hanging on the wall in the center by development theorist and ethicist Denis Goulet: \"Yes, there is a connection between meaningless deaths on one continent and meaningless lives on the other.\" That quote impacted me at a visceral level. I find it is as true today as when I first read it, if not more so. I have worked in various ways to address both realities of meaninglessness and to illuminate the connection. It occurs to me now that my call to be both an activist and a spiritual guide is in some ways, for me, a \"getting at\" that connection and attempting to transform what is meaningless into fuller life. In 1979, Mary Anne completed a five-week traveling seminar in Mexico called \"The Struggle for Social Justice in Latin America\" at a time of tremendous upheaval and liberation movements throughout the southern hemisphere. Since that time, she has had a special devotion to solidarity work in the United States related to those liberation movements in Latin America, including working to change U.S. foreign policy toward human needs instead of military aid for oppressive governments; the Sanctuary Movement for Central American refugees during the 1980s; the Pledge of Resistance to prevent the U.S. invasion of Nicaragua; and the closing of the U.S. Army School of the Americas housed at Ft. Benning, Georgia, where the U.S. has trained thousands of Latin American military officers who have returned to their own countries to commit horrendous human rights violations against civilian populations. She says: I've been an activist all of my adult life. I am an extrovert, and I've been a very \"doing\" person. I've had the opportunity to see first hand and experience deeply some of the incredible problems that we face in our world today, especially for the poor and oppressed. I have been called to accompany them and to advocate with and for them. There is always a feeling that one should not rest while injustice is being done. Although I've always been a reflective person and engaged in reflection, I've been a little late in coming to the value of contemplation. Paying attention to my interior landscape has not figured as prominently as what is out there. It's been a journey for me to marry these two pieces and to learn to value and pay attention to my own soul even while continuing work out in the world to address the burning issues of our day. This meeting place of action on behalf of others and attending to one's own center and relationship with spirit is at the crux of what we need at this moment in our history. A lifelong Catholic, Mary Anne regularly attends St. Mary's student chapel in Ann Arbor, a place that easily integrates her religious beliefs with her social justice values. \"My Catholic identity has evolved over the years, and I continue to embrace the liberating aspects of Catholic social teaching.\" Though Mary Anne has clearly been in leadership and active roles throughout her adult life, one feels the genuine humility that comes along with years of sincere spiritual practice when sitting with her. She listens more than speaks. She honors different perspectives rather than forcing her own agenda. She is sharp, perceptive, and challenging in a gentle, quiet way. Mary Anne is a modern day sage, though she would blush to hear it. And with a delightfully ready sense of humor, she can share a belly laugh as easily as a prayer. As for her home life, Mary Anne has been married to Ricardo Bartelme, M.D., for over thirty-four years. They have raised two sons, Dominick and Micah, who are now grown, and they just became grandparents to a beautiful baby girl named Aria Marin Bartelme, daughter of Dominick and his wife, Lisa. \"Being a partner and a parent,\" says Mary Anne, \"has been a huge part of my own spiritual path. It has been one of the main training grounds for accompanying others through spiritual guidance. It is certainly where many of us find the most challenges and opportunities to become more whole.\" In 2005, Mary Anne enrolled in a two-year long course called The Art of Spiritual Guidance Trainings and Alchemy with Atum O'Kane here in Ann Arbor. \"It is not a certification program in spiritual guidance,\" reports Mary Anne, \"but rather an opportunity to access one's own spiritual guidance. I was asked to help coordinate the second two-year program, so I took the course twice. Later, along with other graduates in this program, I took another year-long course in alchemy (spiritual transformation to become more of our authentic, divine self) with Atum O'Kane. Mr. O'Kane is a gifted teacher who lives in Seattle but travels throughout the world giving trainings.\" (To learn more about him and his training, go to www.atumokane.com) In 2008, Mary Anne enrolled in a two-year certification program at the Haden Institute to become a certified spiritual guide. She is also a member of Spiritual Directors International (www.sdiworld.org). Mary Anne is now established as a spiritual guide , a term she likens to companion. This type of role is not new by any means. According to Mary Anne: It is a time honored tradition in the Catholic Church, but in more recent times it has been embraced by other Christian denominations, Jews, and other world religions, as well as those who do not identify with any particular religion. There is a deeply felt spiritual hunger \"There is always a feeling that one should not rest while injustice is being done.\" Continued on page 36\"Being a partner and a parent has been a huge part of my own spiritual path. It has been one of the main training grounds for accompanying others through spiritual guidance.

Many are seeking out different types of groups, formal or informal, such as book groups, meditation groups, inquiry groups, and conversation groups. People are feeling a need to pay attention to their souls whether that is in the form of their emotional or physical health, their creative side, or their intellectual awakening as to what is happening on the planet. Many are searching for their purpose in life, their mission, asking, \"Why am I here at this time in history? What is my purpose?\" We are seeking wholeness. A very personalized way to do this is to see a specific person on a regular basis to accompany one on the journey. Mary Anne prefers the term spiritual guide to the commonly used term spiritual director. It's a little softer and less \"directive\" sounding, but the process is usually known as spiritual direction. The idea in spiritual direction is that Spirit is the actual director, not the person named as the spiritual director. [In the simplest terms,] being a spiritual guide means to accompany an individual on his or her journey through life. Our spiritual journey is not separate from our life journey. We have one life and one journey. All of us can use some accompaniment along the way to remind us that we are spiritual beings on a human path. There are a number of other interchangeable terms that have been used to describe the role of spiritual guidance, including spiritual midwifery, holy listening, anam cara (Gaelic for soul friend), and accompaniment. Mary Anne says that these are all terms that help describe the nature of her work -- the kind of listening that goes beyond hearing, but involves listening from the heart. Says Mary Anne: We can all use a soul friend, someone who is willing to go there with us. Sometimes this is a literal friend who we feel a close bond with, but sometimes people take the next step and find a relationship that is solely devoted to spiritual growth. The midwife image is such a beautiful one. The laboring mother is the one who gives birth, but the midwife attends to, accompanies, and supports the mother and catches the baby to give it a soft landing. In spiritual guidance, it's not the guide making things happen. It's the hidden things happening inside a person's soul. Sometimes a baby gets stuck, or a foot comes out first, or the baby is coming too fast. The spiritual guide can assist in those moments, listening very carefully to what is happening with the client's soul. Mary Anne Perrone ~ Spiritual Guide, Anam Cara Continued from page 35 The midwife's whole purpose is to be available to the mother. Sometimes this involves asking the right question. Sometimes it is making a comment or a suggestion, but less so. What I have found most helpful is to hold up a mirror. Many times we don't see things about our journey or about ourselves, at least not in that moment. For example, sometimes our words are saying one thing and our body another. If we have a worry about some challenge, someone listening well might see that maybe it isn't all bad or that maybe we have more of the answers than we realize. As a spiritual guide, if we simply reflect back what we hear the other person say, not so much what we think, this can be very helpful. When I was seeing a spiritual guide many years ago, I came to her with a problem having to do with my prayer life. She listened carefully, such a wise woman, then looked at me and said, \"That doesn't sound like a problem to me.\" There is no way in the world that what I was describing didn't sound like a problem to me. But her response shifted things so much that I was able to see things differently. In some ways, spiritual guidance can look a bit like therapy. Sessions are held one-on-one in a quiet, private place, last about an hour, and address the intimate details of an individual's daily life. But the similarities end there. Most important to note is that spiritual guidance is not designed to fix a problem. As Mary Anne says: There is no sense of fixing anything, particularly oneself. Clients are not directed to go back to childhood to resolve anything. We start simply from a desire to grow spiritually and live more consciously, to enrich our relationship with the divine. It can be very therapeutic, and sometimes there is overlap with therapy, but we are not trained as therapists. At its best, spiritual guidance is neither counseling nor advice giving, nor is it directive in any way (just like good therapy). We are essentially there to listen, be present with the seeker, and reflect back to them what they hear. Sometimes both the client and the guide are listening together for what spirit is saying. There is no specific goal that we're \"working toward\" in spiritual guidance, though the process may be healing and clients may feel significant shifts. Sometimes people come in with a particular problem and that may be a starting place but not necessarily. They may think of their problem as a spiritual issue but they also want to deepen their spiritual consciousness. If it is a deeply entrenched psychological problem, we refer them to a trained psychotherapeutic professional.\"There is no sense of fixing anything, particularly oneself. Clients are not directed to go back to childhood to resolve anything. We start simply from a desire to grow spiritually and live more consciously, to enrich our relationship with the divine.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 37 The spiritual guidance session is not just talking about spirituality, the journey, or about practices, though that certainly happens, but the session itself can be a spiritual practice that includes silence, guided meditation, spoken or silent prayer, stopping conversation and doing something else to shift the energy, or giving time over to where the spirit is moving. Says Mary Anne, \"Even though spiritual guidance may involve talking about or listening to a person's understanding of spirit and who God is for them and what their prayer life is like or their meditation practice, often what we're doing is looking at their everyday life. One way of seeing it is to ask the question, 'How is the spirit moving in your life?'\" She continues: Both the guide and the seeker are practicing holy listening. Within this container, the guide is listening to the seeker and spirit in the moment, as well as listening for how the seeker has been listening over the past few weeks since their last meeting. The balance varies from meeting to meeting and person to person. Silence can also play a very important role in the session and can be called upon at any time. In a spiritual guidance session, it is a good thing, not an awkward thing. It is both a time for being and for listening to something other than each other. Though it is called spiritual guidance, one does not have to be religious to partake of Mary Anne's services. Says Mary Anne: Many people today do not identify with a specific religion but are very interested in growing spiritually. If someone wants to start a session off with a particular practice from their tradition that helps him or her to feel more comfortable, such as saying a prayer, chanting, or something else, I would gladly participate in that. It is the person's time to spend how he or she wishes. I am there to accompany their process; it is not my process. Another extremely important function of a spiritual guide is to create sacred space within each session. \"Wherever the meeting takes place,\" says Mary Anne, \"it is set apart from the everyday in both space and time yet in the midst of the everyday. The sacredness is what we create together. Our meeting needs to be safe and imbued with trust and a sense that the person can bring anything at all to the space.\" To facilitate her spiritual guidance sessions, she provides a physical space that is warm and inviting. In that regard, it is a lot about hospitality and comfort. There should be no phones or interruptions. Ideally, there is room for silence. Things like lighting a candle or having an altar or focal point help create a certain atmosphere. Mary Anne sees people in her own living room, though some use an office or other setting. Mary Anne says that sometimes she finds herself with someone: ...on a street corner or a busy cafeteria. It's not always planned. Any of those spaces can be sacred. Sometimes I go into people's homes, for example, if one is too ill to leave the home or if a young mom has little ones and cannot easily come to me. Whenever we enter into a meeting of hearts with the other, this is holy ground. Another aspect to spiritual guidance is that clients are given the opportunity to discuss and/or explore their own spiritual practices or other practices that might be helpful. But Mary Anne warns against the temptation for the guide to get overly caught up in presenting clients with the latest, greatest tool. I know a number of different techniques such as the use of mandalas, movement, breath work, and so on, and if it is the right moment with the right person, these are resources to call upon at any given moment, but generally speaking there is no lesson plan. You don't want to do activities for the sake of the activity. It is all in service to the client's needs in the moment. Hopefully, if I give advice or make specific recommendations, it is not just because I learned it at a recent workshop, but because I see it as a felt need in the moment. Mary Anne says that \"anyone seeking to know one's true self, seeking a closer relationship to spirit and the divine, or who is seeking to enhance one's consciousness in all that one participates in\" can benefit from working with a spiritual guide. When asked what she loves most about being a spiritual guide, Mary Anne said, \"It is a privilege to be invited into people's hearts and souls and into the intricacies of their lives. I love sharing their challenges and joys and witnessing the lights going on when spirit is transforming their lives right before my eyes.\" To contact Mary Anne Perrone to learn more about spiritual guidance, you can email her at maperrone@ameritech.net or call her at (734) 996-9390. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 38 Sustainable Health Classical Homeopathy \u2014 The Way of Life By Monica Gurnani The human body is equipped with a marvelous system of repair and self-preservation. This healing system is active throughout the lifetime of the individual and is capable of restoring the individual's own rhythm and balance if it is given a chance. Homeopathy is a powerful complementary medicine that stimulates this natural healing process through the use of plant and mineral substances in very small doses. Homeopathic remedies act as a catalyst to restore the normal function of the individual at all levels, mind and body. With the aim to restore health rather than suppress symptoms, they bring fast, gentle, effective, and permanent cure without side effects. They are green, not tested on animals, and are derived from natural sources. While many know of homeopathy as a common folk medicine, in places like India, where I trained to be a homeopathic physician, it is integrated into standard care at clinics and hospitals. Among many purposes, it is used to build up the immune system, improve diet, and reduce the side effects of other treatments. It is also used to prepare a person physically and psychologically for the shock and trauma of surgery, as well as shorten the recovery time after surgery. Great personalities like Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, John D. Rockefeller, and Pope John Paul II used homeopathy and encouraged others to use it. The British royal family has used and endorsed homeopathy for the last three generations. To understand homeopathic principles, we can first turn to the definition of homeopathy. It comes from the Greek words homeo meaning similar and pathos meaning disease or suffering. The founder of homeopathy was Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843). Based on his observations he formulated the so-called \"Law of Similars\" in which like cures like. This can be explained with a simple example. One common hay fever remedy is prepared from Allium Cepa (onion) because a healthy person chopping an onion will often get a runny nose and streaming eyes. Thus, Allium Cepa can cure the same set of hay fever symptoms of runny nose and watery eyes. Hahnemanian homeopathy, often called classical homeopathy, is a holistic approach that considers physical, mental, and emotional aspects of an individual. According to the homeopathic way of thinking, a disease originates from a disturbance of the patient's \"vital force.\" This is the life force energy that sustains life. As the origin of disease occurs on this energetic level, the homeopathic remedy also has to be on this level. Such an energetic medicine is made through diluting the remedy and succussing it, or shaking it vigorously. All homeopathic medicines are \"potentized,\" which releases the potential of a substance from its physical matrix so it can operate in an energetic field. Homeopathy has an individualized approach for each person and it takes into consideration all the signs and symptoms manifested by the body and mind. Even two brothers with colds may need different remedies depending on symptom presentation. Homeopathy doesn't look at disease as an external entity. The symptoms manifested by the body during sickness help us to identify a unique remedy for that individual. It's like getting fit for a tailor made dress rather than buying something from the store. The work of the homeopath is then to look at the more subtle level, at the image of the disease, to see the manifestation at the deeper level. By looking at all the aspects of disease, not just the diagnostic symptoms, the perversions of functions that manifest in mind, body, and spirit, the homeopath sees the sum total that provides a sound basis for prescription. The homeopath goes deeper to the root of disease and takes care of things from there. Homeopathic treatment is a two-fold process, including constitutional for chronic complaints and acute for complaints of an acute nature. Homeopathic consultation for a chronic illness or condition consists of a complete case taking, which includes the patient's history, their current condition, and information about their nature (body temperature, energy level, appetite, sleep, personality, and mental and emotional make-up). After collecting all the data, the homeopath takes some time to analyze the case and come up with the remedy that matches all the symptoms presented by the individual. Depending on the patient's response to the remedy, the homeopath may repeat or change the remedy. Chronic illness is caused by \"miasm,\" a homeopathic term derived from the definition \"polluting or residual poisons.\" Miasms can be acquired or inherited and affect the body and the mind. They are like a computer virus that disrupts the programming and crashes the system. Thus, effective treatment of chronic ailments needs a miasmatic remedy. The three original miasms discussed by Hahnemann were Psora (mother of disease), Sycosis, and Syphils, which were followed by the additions of Tubercular and Cancer miasms. Homeopaths understand that miasms exist in various layers within the body and the miasmatic remedy is like peeling away the layers of an onion as we work to correct disease and build health. A few chronic diseases responding successfully to homeopathy are: allergies, asthma, recurrent respiratory infections, A.D.D./A.D.H.D., ear infections, migraines, sinus infections, autism, acid reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, thyroid problems, chronic yeast infections, menopausal related complaints, neuralgias, nervous disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, insomnia, and obesity. Homeopathic consultation for an acute condition (for example, flu, urinary tract infection, headache, food poisoning, ear infection, colic, fever, sprains, bruises, and cuts) can be done in-person or over the telephone. The homeopath will ask questions pertaining to the specific condition and some questions about the person's general mood, sleep, appetite, and so on. I run a family practice and see clients of all ages, from infants to geriatrics. I work with many parents who are drawn to homeopathy because it offers a safe treatment for childhood ailments without side effects. A lot of baby ailments like teething, colic, ear infections, sleep issues, and cold/flu respond effectively with remedies. I recently treated a child who had asthma and had been taking treatments for it. Once we evaluated the case it became clear that his underlying fears, such as fear of water, were a derangement at the emotional level. By treating him with homeopathic remedy and looking at the whole picture, we were able to address his fears and cure his asthma, with no further medication required, thus healing him at all levels. Minor complaints during pregnancy that affect the general well being of the mother, like morning sickness, constipation, or cold and flu, can also be successfully treated using homeopathic remedies. There are even remedies that can be used to help with normal labor and delivery, breast-feeding issues, and for proper bonding of mother and child. There are about 3,000 proved remedies compiled and organized in books formatted by homeopathic practitioners. The homeopathy remedies are prepared under strict guidelines provided by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS). If you are interested in trying homeopathy for your own well being, here are a few remedies that can be used to treat common family illnesses and can be found in the health food store. These remedies can be used in 30c potency and the dosage can be every four to five hours depending on intensity of symptoms (30c is a standard dosage, referring to the centesimal potency scale, in which the dilution contains 1 part mother tincture and 99 parts alcohol or water). Please consult a practitioner for questions or concerns. Arnica: Derived from the plant Arnica Montana, it helps reduce muscle soreness, swelling, bruising, trauma, and shock. Arnica can be used after an accident or minor fall from tripping in the park or outdoor play. It can be used to recover from a strenuous workout. Chamomilla: Made from the chamomile flower, it soothes teething, as well as bloating in the abdomen and stomach of people with severe diarrhea. It can be used for babies who are irritable, scream with anger, are restless, or demand to be held. Aconite: This is especially effective when taken at the first sign of a cold or fever and also treats anxiety and fear after shock or trauma. It can be used after dental treatments. Ruta: Also known as a first aid remedy, it is made from rue, Ruta graveolens, known as the herb of grace. It is used for strains to tissues around bony parts brought on by over exertion, or if the body has general bruised soreness, is aching with weakness, or is worse lying or sitting still. People who need ruta are troubled in their minds. They become quarrelsome and dissatisfied and, despite their restlessness, feel languid and despairing. Caulophyllum: This is a beautiful homeopathic medicine for women in their childbearing years and can be used for certain conditions during pregnancy and labor. In long drawn out labors it is needed for extremely painful, ineffective contractions. When used carefully and correctly with the help of a trained professional, homeopathy is highly effective at treating all types of physical, mental, and emotional disorders. Homeopathy can prevent illness as well as cure it. It helps our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual selves to integrate. When this occurs, our perception of well being is enhanced, our energy levels are increased, and we often feel as though we are at last fulfilling our creative potential.

Petite and soft-spoken, her wispy, once brown hair is now a silky, salty bob. As she sits across from me in the caf\u00e9, I remember that smile from the examining room. The smile lit up the room each time she entered. Dr. Saunders was my primary care physician for over twenty years. When I under- went various medical procedures, she visited me in the hospital. When I was far from Ann Arbor and had medical concerns, she walked me through them by phone, having given me her cell phone number. It is no wonder that news of her departure from the old medical clinic prompted tears from many of her former patients. Some will follow her to the Natural Balance Wellness Medical Center, where she has just launched her new practice. Those without acceptable insurance must find someone else. Saunders herself mourns the loss of these patients who, she says, taught her so much. Her grieving has ebbed now that she is working in a holistic setting, long the object of her dreams. She is excited to move from allopathic medicine to an integrative modality. \"Allopathic medicine,\" a term she uses frequently, is more commonly known as \"Western medicine,\" and is the term of choice for advocates of alternative medicine. \"Allopathic,\" a term coined in 1810 by Samuel Hahnemann, a homeopath, refers to conventional or modern medicine, which uses either pharmaceuticals or physical interventions to treat or suppress symptoms or pathological processes. Saunders has had considerable experience with illness \u2014 as a medical caretaker, as a patient, and as kin. At age 13, she was diagnosed with cancer. Surgery for the rhabdomyosarcoma, which presented as a lump on her back, was followed by chemotherapy. \"The chemo wasn't too bad,\" she says. Only later do I learn that she experienced most of the usual side effects: nausea, fatigue, constipation, hair loss, mild anemia. But she never threw up, so she thought herself lucky. The perk of chemo was having additional time with her dad, who drove her to the treatments. Otherwise, she didn't see him much. Her parents divorced when she was nine, and then her father married a woman who wanted nothing to do with his six children. Their mother \u2014 schizophrenic and alcoholic \u2014 had custody of the children. Amy, the youngest of the brood, strongly identified with her physician father. As a little girl, she adored him. But neither he nor anyone else in the family told her that she had cancer. Today, she marvels at her youthful lack of curiosity and wonders why she never asked what was wrong with her. Life has a habit of throwing monkey wrenches, and life wasn't through with her. Soon after the birth of her second child, Saunders was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). That diagnosis came in 1995, when her beloved brother, Tim, was dying of the same disease. His was chronic progression MS, and he was already wheelchair bound, with recurrent decubitus ulcers (bedsores) and many other symptoms. Their sister, Becky, meanwhile, was battling metastatic breast cancer. Five years older than Amy, Becky \"was more a mother than sister to me,\" says Saunders. \"Growing up, we slept in the same bed. She kept things in order at home, since we couldn't rely on our mother.\" Becky was 37 years old and pregnant when she received her diagnosis. She died in 2000. She was 49 and left a 12-year-old daughter. As Tim's MS pro-gressed, Amy struggled with the question of whether he should come live with her. He told her it felt wrong; he did not want her to watch his demise. After one closed-door discussion with him, Amy's older daughter, then four years old, said: \"Mommy, who do you love more, me or Uncle Tim?\" That clinched it. Motherhood came first. Tim remained in California, where he died in 2003. \"The decade between 1995 and 2005 was very sad, and hard,\" says Saunders. Though she feels \"fortunate\" that she has only a mild, manageable form of MS, she no longer takes life \u2014 or health \u2014 for granted. Partly in response to her own chronic illness, partly in response to stories from patients who found relief in alternative, complementary healers, Saunders pursues, promotes, and advocates for alternative therapies. When her musculoskeletal symptoms flare, or when she feels \"things are getting significantly out of whack,\" she seeks chiropractic care and physical therapy. She also frequents a practitioner of polarity therapy and craniosacral massage, which, she says, \"have helped minimize spasticity and pain more than any allopathic treatment I have received.\" Saunders views her illness as a key to new learning opportunities. \"Personal growth and increasing self awareness have been important to me,\" she says, and she speaks highly of her experience of psychotherapy. She also encourages stress reduction, which has been shown to have clear health benefits. She notes that many comple-mentary therapies \u2014 for example polarity therapy, craniosacral massage, Reiki, meditation, and acupuncture \u2014 have been found to reduce stress or tension in the body. (Note that polarity therapy, like Reiki, works with the human energy field and operates on the principle that the flow and balance of energy in the human body is the foundation of good health.) Saunders has little patience with doctors who dismiss alternative healing methods without bothering to learn about them. She is impatient, too, with current trends in conventional medicine. \"I have become convinced over time that our medical system is too oriented toward drug therapy, in large part because of the dominance of phar-maceutical industry in funding research and influencing papers submitted for publi-cation.\" The problem, as she sees it, goes far beyond the greed of drug companies. Our basic understanding of illness has been too constricted and contrived by our focus on the disease model. We are taught to treat diseases, not patients, and one of the sad results is that there is judgment and bias against patients who are unfor-tunate enough to present a medical problem that doesn't fit neatly into a disease \"I think it is important to be open not only to the knowledge and skills that other practitioners have, but also open to acknowledging our own limitations in knowledge and treatment options in allopathic medicine.\" - Dr. Amy Saunders Integrative Approaches ~ Dr. Amy Saunders Opens Up about Illness, Contemporary Medicine, and her Transition to a Holistic Practice Continued on page 40The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 40 definition. They are either subject to distortion of their real clinical picture to try to fit it into a recognizable disease category, or they might be accused of \"not really having a disease,\" in which case their psychological functioning is suspect.... We make no effort to validate their medical concern and actually seek to understand it and treat it appropriately. I do have anger at the medical profession for claiming that other ways of evaluating and treating illness are quackery when they refuse to learn anything about these approaches that they condemn. I think it is important to be open not only to the knowledge and skills that other practitioners have, but also open to acknowledging our own limitations in knowledge and treatment options in allopathic medicine. Over the years, when Saunders's patients reported to her about their visits to alter- native practitioners, her first question was, and still is: \"Did it help?\" She listens and learns. She attends workshops and seminars and has integrated many techniques and approaches into her own medical practice. She has routinely referred patients to physical therapists, massage therapists, chiropractors, acupuncturists, psychothera-pists, nutritionists, and others. She recommends books, too, citing some she found \"pivotal\" in her own life, such as: How Can I Help by Ram Dass and Paul Gorman; The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche; Life Lessons by Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross; The Pathwork of Self-Transformation by Eva Pierrakos; and The Unde-fended Self by Susan Thesenga. Saunders is pleased that at Natural Balance Wellness Medical Center she will be working with several alternative practitioners. She will also offer therapies that she could not provide before. She looks forward to using low-level laser therapy, also known as photodynamic therapy, which has been shown to improve healing of lo-cal sites of inflammation such as tendonitis or chronic wounds. It also reduces the swelling that results from impaired lymphatic drainage and other conditions. In Ann Arbor, laser therapy is currently used by physical therapists, including at U-M and by many sports teams, chiropractors, and veterinarians, but, she adds, \"It hasn't had the kind of role I think it should in the primary care setting.\" She will also focus more on nutritional therapy, using supplements or herbs that have been shown to have health benefits. She explains: Many people are not aware of the pro-inflammatory effects of the typical American diet, nor of the nutritional steps one can take to counter that. Healthy diet, stress reduction, and in some cases addition of some antioxidant vitamins and supplements can help reduce the body's level of oxidative stress. I think complementary providers are way ahead of us in their understanding of nutritional deficiencies and the effect that poor nutrition and other pro-inflammatory exposures such as external stresses have on the body. Allopathic researchers are just now realizing that many illnesses are a manifestation of inflammation. And we don't know that much yet about how to alter that internal inflammatory state. While Saunders routinely refers patients to surgeons, oncologists, neurologists, dermatologists, orthopedists, and other medical specialists, she is keenly aware of the liabilities of many modern procedures. \"Let's face it,\" she says, \"lots of care that we provide in allopathic medicine is stress-inducing: chemotherapy, being in an I.C.U., pre- and post-operative states, life and death situations, terminal illness. Most conditions are best dealt with using a combination of care approaches.\" When mak- \"I think complementary providers are way ahead of us in their understanding of nutritional deficiencies and the effect that poor nutrition and other pro-inflammatory exposures such as external stresses have on the body.\" ing referrals for complementary treatments, she keeps several factors in mind. High on the list is patients' preferences. \"I believe that honoring a patient's own sense of empowerment, intuition, and autonomy often is therapeutically beneficial.\" Asked how she makes referrals, she says: Some conditions, like acute infections and cases where surgery was clearly needed, are best handled by an allopathic physician. But a condition like acute or chronic musculoskeletal pain would often be handled better by a chiropractor or massage therapist, especially when the pelvis, spine, or ribcage were out of alignment. Many chronic conditions: fatigue, headaches, insomnia, depression, but also diabetes and hypertension, have complementary approaches to care that are often better than M.D.s' tendency to prescribe more and more medications. Bring up the subject of the health insurance industry, and she is likely to say: \"Don't get me started.\" That industry, along with the pharmaceutical lobby, raises her hack-les. But getting Amy Saunders started is a good way to learn. She says: I am saddened by the state of healthcare in this country today. I believe that health- care should be a right not a privilege, and that is not the case today in the U.S. The best way to provide care to all is with a single payer system. It is a myth \u2014 or rather a deceit \u2014 that people in Canada, France, Denmark and other countries are less happy with their healthcare system than we are. And most policies in the U.S. have far more restrictions on what physician a patient may see than in Canada (or in government administered programs in the U.S. for that matter \u2014 Medicare and the V.A.). The rising costs of healthcare now are driven in large part by the high administrative costs associated with private insurance. There are myriad companies and thousands of different policies, all with different regulations and an underlying profit motive. They make paperwork complicated. Every hospital has to employ many people \u2014 thousands at U of M \u2014 to do billing and try to navigate the maze of requirements for each policy. Insurance companies routinely deny coverage in order to force physi-cians and patients to go through the complex appeals process. They hire people to review cases to find reasons to retroactively deny coverage for care, and they use their profits to line their own pockets rather than contribute ideas to help improve access to care. Further, they advertise and pay lobbyists large sums of money to make citizens and lawmakers afraid of a single party payer system and of healthcare reform in general. Shame on them! Up to now, they have been able to raise premiums without re-strictions and drop clients freely, as soon as they start having significant healthcare expenses. Only now, with the Affordable Healthcare Act, is there starting to be some restrictions on insurance companies' profits and their freedom to deny coverage. She stops herself with: \"Sorry about the rant.\" She doesn't need to apologize to me. I enjoy her rants and ask her to address the issue of \"productivity\" in current medical practice. In medical parlance, \"productivity\" refers to the number of patients a physi-cian sees per hour. Dr. Saunders always seemed to have all the time in the world for me. I hadn't realized that she worked part-time, an arrangement that allowed her to extend patient consults using her own time. Responding to my \"productivity\" ques-tion, she says: There is no question in my mind that the way we measure quality of patient care is misguided and at risk for becoming even worse as we take the wrong steps in trying to fix it. The first misguided theory is that the spiraling costs of health care are largely being blamed on the inefficiencies and overprescribing and overuse of medical tests by clinic physicians. And the solutions then seem to be to improve their efficiency, have docs see more patients for a shorter period of time and have \"cheaper caregiv-ers\" provide care (for example, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants), and to oversee the clinical physicians' performance to make sure they have adequate \"productivity\" and appropriate care. Somehow it is ignored that these changes erode quality of care. Those fallacies need to be corrected in order for the right reform to take place without sacrificing quality of care. The way to solve the problem is: First, change the reimbursement system so it doesn't reward procedures more than preventive or primary care. Currently it is very profitable for a health center to do more and more procedures, tests, and surgeries. They sometimes are medically unnecessary, especially at the end of life, but the re-imbursement and profit are the same. Second, change the awareness and attitudes about end of life care. Our society generally has failed to acknowledge and com-passionately address the fruitlessness of aggressive care in the dying patient. The inappropriate, painful interventions that are done even when there is no chance of recovery are unethical in my opinion. They are also absurdly expensive. Third, reign in pharmaceutical company profits and insurance company profits and waste. Ideally a single payer system would be most efficient and least expensive, but even without that, many structural changes can be made that will have much greater impact on reducing costs than policing the primary care doc in the clinic setting. And none of these reforms would have a negative impact on the doctor-patient relationship. Growing up in Findlay, Ohio, a small, conservative town, where her Harvard-trained father practiced family medicine, Saunders never envisioned these complications. She often went with her dad to his clinic, sometimes joining him on rounds at the nursing home, where he was the primary care physician. She was proud that her father was a doctor. Given her early status as a cancer survivor, she felt she had a special understanding of other people suffering. There was even a period when she saw herself as a victim. She hastens to add that she traces that feeling \"to my chaotic \"Our society generally has failed to acknowledge and compassionately address the fruitlessness of aggressive care in the dying patient. The inappropriate, painful interventions that are done even when there is no chance of recovery are unethical in my opinion.\" Integrative Approaches ~ Dr. Amy Saunders Opens Up about Illness, Contemporary Medicine, and her Transition to a Holistic Practice Continued from page 39childhood and many losses \u2014 father to divorce, mother to schizophrenia and alco- holism, siblings moving away\" as well as to her experience with cancer. \"It took me a while to see how sanctimonious my perspective was,\" she says, exposing a certain rueful humility. Though it is rare for her to talk publicly about herself (this article is a breakthrough for her), she has long used poetry to express her inner self. She called one poem \"The Martyr's Prayer,\" but subtitled it \"A Cautionary Tale,\" \"to remind myself to not inflate the meaning of my suffering.\" She cringes to think she ever used the word \"martyr\" to describe herself. Saunders's change of heart occurred while she was in medical school at Ohio State, a two-hour drive from where she grew up. As she became increasingly aware of the ubiquitous nature of suffering, she began exploring the meaning of health in society. After completing her residency, also at Ohio State, she went to Duke on a two year fellowship in general internal medicine and, while there, she earned a master's in public health from the University of North Carolina. Her broadened perspective has taken her medical understanding to new dimensions. \"Everyone has inner wisdom, and everyone's task is to find their own path toward healing and peace of mind. I no longer feel like [my experience] sets me apart. These things rather bind me to others, as we are all in the same boat. We are all 'wounded healers,' as Rachel Remen says in Kitchen Table Wisdom.\" Turning to practical matters, I ask what insurance she will accept at her new clinic. She mentions that establishing her credentials to be a certified provider was an ordeal, mostly because each insurance company requires completion of a \"load of paperwork.\" At the time of this writing, she will be able to provide care for people who have Blue Cross Blue Shield, straight Medicare, Cofinity, Aetna, and HAP . The process is ongoing. Meanwhile, Saunders is pleased to be in a place where her work is more aligned with her values. She relishes the time allotted to see patients. She likes her new office, the pictures on the walls, her customized electronic medical record, and the way the clinic communicates with patients. The way the clinic is run reflects her attitude and philosophy about patient care. In retrospect, she appreciates the latitude she had to practice integrative medicine while working in the University of Michigan Health System. While she had cause for frustration regarding restrictions on time and on the therapy she could provide, she now realizes that part of her problem there was a function of internal dissonance. She chose to see herself as an outsider struggling The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 41 \"Now that I have left the medical center, I realize that I don't feel the need to see things as an 'us versus them' kind of struggle. That's good because that would be counter to my goal to integrate the best of many approaches to patient care for each individual patient.\" against the system. \"Now that I have left the medical center,\" she says, \"I realize that I don't feel the need to see things as an 'us versus them' kind of struggle. That's good because that would be counter to my goal to integrate the best of many approaches to patient care for each individual patient.\" To look at Amy Saunders today is to see a picture of health. She works at it. She meditates two to three times a week, eats wisely, visits her masseuse as needed, and holds stress at bay, where possible. She also has remarkable perspective. I realize how amazingly fortunate I have been. I have been blessed to have had great love and support from my siblings, a wonderful husband, and have two terrific daughters, aged 18 and 23 [who are] very supportive and compassionate people. I have also had the opportunity to do work I love with brilliant colleagues, and meet and be friends with some amazing and beautiful people. I also have had a very mild course of my multiple sclerosis. All of these blessings have filled me with a new sense of gratitude. These blessings also support and promote her capacity to embrace new opportuni- ties for growth. Several years ago, she went to China with a group of physicians to see how Chinese medical centers integrated old and new medical approaches. She has worked with several Chinese practitioners in the area since her return. She is a frequent visitor to Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, and attends its lecture and Salon events. She cultivates a sense of humor. She lives to learn. Dr. Amy Saunders's new practice is located at the Natural Balance Wellness Medical Center at 1310 S. Main Street in Ann Arbor.

Traktung is an American born lama in the Nyingma lineage of Vajrayana Buddhism, and he and his wife, Katie, are the leaders of the Tsogyelgar Dharma Center on West Liberty in Ann Arbor. He will be the guest speaker at a Crazy Wisdom Salon, Thursday, March 14th at 7 pm. Traktung is well-known to long-time Crazy Wisdom Community Journal readers, and to Buddhist practitioners in the area. We did a lengthy interview with Traktung in our Spring 1998 issue. (At that time, the publication was called the Crazy Wisdom Calendar , Traktung was known as Khepa, and his community was known as Crazy Cloud Hermitage.) We have posted that interview on our CW Journal web archive at www.crazywisdom.net. We also published a photographic spread on the Tsogyelar Dharma Center in the May thru August 2010 issue (starting on page 14 of issue #45), which is also available on our web archive.

Her neck is a swan \u2014 the great Paramahansa, and her every word \u2014 a secret script All in All a constellation of happiness.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 43 Day 5. For many years not a day would pass in which I didn't feel intense fear at the thought of my life slipping away before I realized its deepest meaning. One day I jotted down a bit of advice from me to myself about this illness that cures. Things to be kept together. Things to be kept apart.Emptiness' open space and luminosity's clarity, these are two things that should not be kept apart. Mind's luminosity and deity's form, These are two things that should not be kept apart. The appearance of beings and spontaneous compassion, these are two things that should not be kept apart. The practice of dharma and public display, these are two things that should be kept apart. Speculative talk and one's precious time, These are two things that should be kept apart. The mind's intrinsic dignity and the eight worldly concerns, these are two things that should be kept apart. The world's appearance and the celestial palace, these are two things that should not be kept apart. The sun and the moon as seat for the deity, these are two things that should not be kept apart. One's every breath and the deity's recitation, these are two things that should not be kept apart. The waning days of our lives and problematic companions, these are two things that should be kept apart. Our every breath and negative gossips, these are two things that should be kept apart. Our mind's freedom and kowtowing to others, these are two things that should be kept apart. One's every moment and the inner warmth, these are two things that should be kept together. The precious bindu and our own body these are two things that should be kept together. The mind's great bliss and the expanse of space, these are two things that should be kept together. A leaky faucet and an expensive mansion, these are two things that should be kept apart. Jungle tigers and sheep in a pen, these are two things that should be kept apart. Ordinary desiring and the great third conduct, these are two things that should be kept apart. Primordial purity and easeful spontaneity, these are two things that should not be kept apart. All appearance and empty awareness, these are two things that should not be kept apart. All phenomena and complete exhaustion, these are two things that should not be kept apart. A high view but low actions, this brings shame upon a yogi. Fancy words but no realization, this signals the old age of a lineage. Buddha's dharma and politics, This means the nail has been driven in the coffin. If you are scared that death's appointment with your life might come before you have understood the meaning of Buddha's words then shun all politics and the eight worldly concerns, embrace the lineage of practice, cultivate unwavering faith in the Guru and utter sincerity. With these there is no way to fail.Day 7. We both step and do not step in the same rivers. We are and are not. \u2014Heraclitus Once upon a time Aristotle, that sage founder of our tradition of reason and logic, was walking down the beach. It was a crisp clear day and the ocean waves were perfectly still leaving the surface of the water like a mirror. Further down the beach Aristotle could see an unusual activity taking place; a man was running to the water's edge, bending down and then running a short way back up the beach toward the sand. After some time Aristotle came close enough to recognize the figure, Heraclitus, that enigmatic figure who many called The Obscure and others called The Riddler. Now Aristotle's mind became full of irritating thoughts as he recalled the words of Heraclitus' philosophy such as \"flow, transformation, hidden harmony.\" There was no harmony between his system and the system of this man who hid his confusions behind enigmatic meaninglessness, mystic mumbo jumbo. Coming closer Aristotle called out, \"Hello there good man, what are you doing?\" Heraclitus stopped his frenetic activity and answered, \"Ah, yes, I am using this spoon for a grand project. I have dug this small hole here in the sand and I am taking the water from the ocean and filling the hole. Let me show you.\" Thus said, Heraclitus ran back down to the water, filled the spoon, ran back and poured the contents into the hole. Aristotle, now standing by the hole, looked down and saw the water sink into the sand leaving the hole empty again. \"You are a fool!\" exclaimed Aristotle, \"Look at the vast ocean, look at your tiny hole, you can not fit the ocean into the hole. And, as soon as you pour the water in it rushes back out again. Look! The hole is empty!\" Heraclitus did not seem disturbed by this, in fact, he laughed out loud. \"Yes, yes, you speak truly. But, my dear Aristotle, if this makes me a fool then what are you? Look how vast the universe is and how small your head. You will never fit the mystery of this universe into your small box of reason. Death will come and your head will also be empty.\" Jean Piaget discovered that a child develops their capacity for knowing organically along with age and brain development. The brain is one organ of knowledge, there are others. Subtle capacities for knowing truth, beauty, love, enlightenment abide within the human being. There are human stages of growth just as for children but these higher stages require conscious participation. They are the inner import of the spiritual path. When a human being matures beyond satisfaction with the shallow consolation of a society based on partial wisdom then they will seek the way . . . and it is there. Day 15. If your robe is white but your heart is black\u2014What then, yogi?If your hair is long but your compassion short\u2014What then, yogi? If your ornaments jangle but so does your mind\u2014 What then, yogi? If your posture is perfect but your heart is crooked\u2014 What then, yogi? If your status is high but your qualities low\u2014 What then, yogi? If the monk dyes his robe red but his heart is not dyed in the color of love, what then? If the yogi wears a simple robe of white but his mind, stained with grasping, is drenched in the color of death\u2014what then? He is a real yogi who can sit upon a stainless lotus without roots, whose heart resounds with silence, who eats the pulse and rhythm of Being for breakfast and who wears the body of illusions. Standing outside all concerns, an ornament of Love, he is at rest in the midst of all actions. Continued on page 44If your robe is white but your heart is black \u2014 what then, yogi? If your hair is long but your compassion short \u2014 what then, yogi? If your ornaments jangle but so does your mind \u2014 what then, yogi? If your posture is perfect but your heart is crooked \u2014 what then, yogi? The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 44 Day 33. Meditation in solitary places make the yogi happy.

Day 52. Standing, dwarfed by the Eiffel Tower's mass of steel, body feels joy and beauty. People go up and down taking pleasure in the Paris views and each other's company . A girl in the elevator smiled, her mind was utterly pure, silent, and filled with beauty. There are sublime beings, hidden from almost all, in the most ordinary places. Without contrivance or even intention their liberated wisdom enacts effects on all those around them, without anyone ever knowing. Hidden sages.No one noticed her. Peace pervaded her face and she simply stood amidst the crowd in the elevator. At the top of the tower she looked out over the city, enveloping it in her silent joy. After some time she came down the elevator again and walked away. Her body did not know the past. Her mind was free from the scars of ego. No one noticed her and yet her blessings had flowed across Paris from the Eiffel Tower's height. Watching her, body was filled with benediction, every cell. On what does consciousness happen? Beingness, consciousness, happens somewhere, on something\u2014like images played across a screen. Appearances happen inside of consciousness like the currents and eddies within a deep lake, but where does consciousness happen? It is impossible to know the answers to these questions in conceptual mind. You can not \"know\" the answer to what is prior to consciousness but you Eye To Form is only Love \u2014 A Journal of 100 Days Continued from page 43can discover you are that. The body can abide in and as that and enact its qualities in the world. The girl's mind was rooted in a deep space beyond even being and non-being. Her body was that mystery's animation. The deepest aspect of the path is prior to consciousness. The perceiving of the world and of beingness flows out as the active potential of \"that\"\u2014a pure irreducible, unutterable, mystery. It is not a new identity\u2014it is beyond identity. The girl, maybe 19 or 20 years old, was a treasure in the ruin of humanity's confusion and struggle. Her eyes spoke of knowing and love to anyone who knew how to look into their wonder. Even though no one seemed to notice that they were in the presence of a blessed one, still their lives would be enriched through even this minimal, unconscious, contact. Such a wonder, the hidden ones. Day 61. Dear Friend, you asked for a few simple words to remind you what it is to be a yogi. You also asked if I would write a prayer whereby you could remember me. Well, I have no interest in you remembering me . . . so, if you can use this for the same purpose then so be it. Homage to the stainless heart of victorious ones!Homage to invariant light!Homage to the result, which exists as the cause!Homage to ground Dharmakaya! Glorious Heruka, tamer of those hard to tame, Lord of the Tantras cavorting in great bliss, the Jewel of Activity\u2014Mind itself, the great Vajradhara, to inseparable appearance emptiness I bow down. Magical appearance of ceaseless compassion, Kaya of the single family of the great secret,To the warming rays of wisdom and love,To The Guru Pema Tro Tren Tsel, I bow down. Father Lama, who is only kindness, special deity, who is the noble dharma, assemblage of Vajrayogini, noble sangha, to the three roots I bow down. This body, a mandala of secrets, its heart is the Heart of all Sugatas, its pleasures are the outer offering, its kleshas are the inner offering and inseparable wisdom bliss suffices for the secret offering! To a yogi obstacles and easy times are pretty much the same. In the playful realm of ceaseless manifestation Here and there are an infinite palace.Realize this and you won't need to go wandering.To a yogi coming and going are pretty much the same. In the dimension of luminosity and lucidity Strangers and companions are both the deity.Realize this and love will find its own place.To a yogi friends and foes are pretty much the same. In the great indestructible bindu's stronghold Mind remains unborn no matter how many lives you've had.Realize this and you won't fret over who you were and who you will be. To a yogi being born or dying are\u2014pretty much the same. In the vast of Mind's own way of abiding Emptiness and appearance are mere words.Realize this and you will be able to rest at ease.To a yogi doing and non-doing are pretty much the same. Listen fortunate child of the Buddhas: by connecting the profound oral instructions to the lineage of accomplished practice, the result, present from the start, becomes manifest\u2014doubts and efforts are laid to rest and like a carefree tiger you roam the jungle of awareness appearance. The expanse of awareness is without inner or outer. The expanse of wisdom is without clarity or obscuration.The expanse of dharmadhatu is pervasive.The expanse of the Great Bindu is beyond transition.The expanse of experience is without interruption. Well, there you go, love. There are sublime beings, hidden from almost all, in the most ordinary places. Without contrivance or even intention their liberated wisdom enacts effects on all those around them, without anyone ever knowing. Hidden sages. To know love without grasping. To know beauty without wishing ownership. To touch the essence of life within the display of forms is the purpose and meaning of human life.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 45 Day 73. ..... a single thought of love and this old shirt fills with warmth, worn cuff, one button missing, soft with days and nights. If I could share the indescribable beauty discovered in perception when mind is gone to Silence there would be no more violence, no more alienation. This longing.The communicative thrust of joy.The afterthought of luminosity. This mind without form, form without limit,no need for the extraordinary. Day 78. Do you know . . . . . . . .the flavors of sunrise, eye meeting form, lover meeting love? Have you known the silent way light moves from heart to eye to form the world from a stuff far more wondrous than dreams? Do pine's shadow and how damp forest soil tastes to the soul? Have you known spring's greening of life deep into the marrow, the fields, pastures, plains of body's landscape? . the way meets sound, old friend, new love, fragile first kiss? Have you known bird calls, the cry of a baby, the sound of an engine, rested in mind's vast space, known as Love only? . the casual disregard, the wounded heart torn by unlove? Have you known the shipwrecks of this life's efforts, the taste acrid in the mouth, the sharp crystals of reason? hornet of alienation's repeated sting?Have you known a thousand shattered pieces of dawn, sun meeting dark sky, spread out across your day with the cold of no regret? Do that restores mind and heart?Have you known the dreaming dark knowing with its mysterious tiny-ness of all moments\u2014so small they engulf the world. Day 84. She is a fabulous Being\u2014half human,half drum, flute and symbol.(an orchestra of erotic Realism) Hips of invitation, heavy with joy, alive with knowledge and the Freedom of delight. Not pornography but iconography describes that liquid motion. Across the sky of mind, her touch rings like a turquoise belltransforming the bandits of passion, healing wounds of flesh and memory long forgotten, lost in deep places of earth. Caverns of lineage teaching form her belly, a deep navel birthplace of Buddhas. Her neck is a swan\u2014the great Paramahansa, and her every word\u2014a secret scriptAll in All a constellation of happiness. For twelve hundred years I have been lost to the smile of those hips\u2014the hidden ground of primordial wisdom. Since that day , I find in the motion of love and form and body not the tired end of desire or fretful consolation but the pulse of living, a deep moss scent of life, a wild bluegesture out beyond One or Two In each naked moment our living arises without correction or distraction. This is the natural yoga of spontaneous joy. H er eyes were the way of open sky, Whatever arises\u2014instantly known as Emptiness Brightness, that de licate color of compassion, and filled here without contemplation or without effort. me with the wild clar ity of joy and then entered Unobstructed, primordially pure, our own original nature me int o a forest of primeval humor. is the union of perception and delight.Eye to form is only love and this redeems the world.Day 100. Why did Rebbe Nachman go to Uman? To redeem the world. Why are you here? \u2014Dr. Kullman, Kenyon College Eye to form is only love\u2014without implication of being. Without problem of non-being. Free from dogma of perceiver or perceived. The sky was blue and mauve, white with clouds and infinite like mind. A single crow, blacker than black, flew across its breadth. Mind was shattered into silence, its pieces scattered across the sea of meanings. Walking between the pines the smell of sap filled the nostrils. Perception is pure pleasure; the meeting of sense and sense field the enactment of primal love. Sometimes, suddenly, the whole body is made terribly alive, filled with a mysterium tremendum whose force practically takes away the . . . . . . . the silence. To know love without grasping. To know beauty without wishing ownership. To touch the essence of life within the display of forms is the purpose and meaning of human life. It is in this act that we fulfill our being obligation debt. It is in this profound alchemy of perception that gross matter is transformed into the achingly tender love play of divinity revealed. In this revelation all appearance is redeemed. Eye to form is only love and this redeems the world.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 47 A Body of Artists and Their Bodies at Work By Syndy Sweeney It is said the mirror never lies...but the woman looking into it often does. Instead of seeing beauty, strength, and purpose in her body and its parts, a woman often only sees cellulite, weight, imbalance, imperfection, age, and scars. She meditates not on acceptance, but on how she doesn't measure up to the standards of society. She doesn't believe her body is good enough. By default, neither is she. But she is. And four local artists, all of whom have faced their own challenges with body image, show in their lives and art that their bodies \u2014 and all women's bodies \u2014 are not just good enough, they're glorious. Continued on Page 48The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 48 W hen Elizabeth Raymond , the owner of Boundless Beauty Studio in Ypsilanti, graduated from Washtenaw Community College with a degree in Photographic Technology, she wasn't interested in taking photos of people. Instead, she was attracted to nature, finding beauty in its landscapes of rolling hills and curves. But an experience that took her in front of the camera began to change her mind: Raymond posed for boudoir photographs. Assigned to take a self-portrait in one of her classes, Raymond didn't know what to do. Then, she remembered a photograph she found of her grandmother: It was a head shot that she had sent to Raymond's grandfather during World War II. In a popular pose for the time, her grandmother's shoulders were bare. Inspired, Raymond duplicated her grandmother's photo, with a boudoir twist, for her own self-portrait. Having struggled with her weight, Raymond could not believe the results. \"The pictures came out so beautiful!\" Surely, she thought, the camera had caught only good angles and not her problem areas. \"I wasn't very proud of myself and what I looked like...I didn't have a very positive self-image.\" It wasn't until she took sexy photos of a friend that Raymond fully understood: A woman's body is a landscape of loveliness.Elizabeth's grandmotherElizabeth Raymond, owner of Boundless Beauty Studio According to Raymond, a pregnant model might say, \"I look horrible, I feel tired...God, I'm so fat right now!\" To which she responds, \"It's not fat! Women really believe this! They're not fat! They're creating something beautiful and they're showing it on their insides and out... women glow when they're pregnant.\" Raymond doesn't rush her clients and she guides them into poses, often demonstrating with her own body. \"I'm like a size 18 and I'm sexy. And so, I know what sexy is and I can pose sexy.\" Although she hasn't yet photographed a woman who has conquered breast cancer, Raymond believes she could help such a woman see her changed, but still beautiful, body with fresh eyes. A Body of Artists and Their Bodies at Work Photo by Boundless Beauty StudioThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 49 But it wasn't until she took sexy photos of a friend that Raymond fully understood: A woman's body is a landscape of loveliness. \"I enjoy taking pictures of people now,\" she says. \"And it began with women, because women are nature. Women have beautiful curves. They have the curves of nature and they have the gentleness of the petals of a flower.\" She captures these gentle curves during both her boudoir and maternity photo sessions. Understanding firsthand the delicacy and courage required to pose while wearing little clothing, Raymond goes out of her way to not only make her clients comfortable, but to pamper them. She prefers to book no more than one photo session in a day. First there is an initial consultation appointment. This allows Raymond the time to get to know each client personally. Discovering her client's occupation, passions, children, and spouse are things Raymond can refer to during the photo session \"that might bring spirit\" to her client's face. In this initial consultation, Raymond also urges her models to get comfortable with their facial expressions by practicing in a mirror at home. Prior to a photo shoot, Raymond recommends her clients get as much sleep as possible and to not starve themselves. In fact, she prefers that, on the day of the session itself, her models eat before they arrive. While Raymond suggests not overdoing make-up, she does recommend wearing a pair of false eyelashes, which \"...brings your eyes out...people see your personality in your eyes.\" Raymond helps the personality shine brighter right before a photography session by giving her clients a gift, to connect to their beauty or \"bring out their sexy.\" It may be a bottle of perfume or something special the client revealed she likes during her consultation. \"It's that extra oomph right at the beginning...that one gift is worth, like, forty great pictures!\" Even if a client is a bit anxious at the beginning of a session, Raymond ensures the anxiety is temporary. She doesn't rush her clients and she guides them into poses, often demonstrating with her own body. \"I'm like a size 18 and I'm sexy. And so, I know what sexy is and I can pose sexy,\" Raymond says. \"[Clients] don't have to be scared. They don't have to feel self-conscious around me.\" If any self-consciousness does linger, it tends to be with the women sitting for maternity photographs, rather than boudoir. Boudoir clients typically are women who have been married for ten to fifteen years and want to show their husbands that, although they're a bit older, they're as sexy as ever. But for maternity clients, the photo sessions can be more emotional.According to Raymond, a pregnant model might say, \"I look horrible, I feel tired...God, I'm so fat right now!\" To which she responds, \"It's not fat! Women really believe this! They're not fat! They're creating something beautiful and they're showing it on their insides and out....women glow when they're pregnant.\" Because of this glow, Raymond can always tell when a woman is pregnant, even at one or two months; but she prefers to take photos of women who are in their eighth month, when their curves are at their most exquisite. Because Raymond finds all women's bodies beautiful, she will also make a donation from her boudoir sessions during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, as well as offer those women who are currently suffering from breast cancer or have survived the disease 50% off of their prints. \"We know this is something that women struggle with...and we understand that women are still beautiful after breast cancer...This is something that affects a lot of women and their self-image.\" Although she hasn't yet photographed a woman who has conquered breast cancer, Raymond believes she could help such a woman see her changed, but still beautiful, body with fresh eyes. Raymond, who lives and works in Ypsilanti along with her boyfriend and business partner, Dan Woodward, continues to see her body with fresh eyes. Once again, she's moving to the other side of the camera for her second boudoir session. She'll proudly share these photos on her website, proving to herself and her clients that a woman's body is always beautiful. For Brenda Oelbaum , a mixed media artist who lives in Ann Arbor with her husband, Dr. Ben Margolis, and two sons, Simon and Leo, accepting the beauty of her own body has been a long and difficult journey that has included eating disorders, decades of dieting, and stages of recovery \u2014 all of which have found expression in her artwork. At the age of seven, Oelbaum turned to food to cope with an emotional trauma. Although her parents were still living, she was brought from Montreal to Toronto to be adopted by her maternal uncle and his wife. This new family brought with it new pressure. According to Oelbaum, \"They were very socially astute...and things had to look a certain way, and it was really reflective of the family if you were not dressed properly or didn't look fashionably correct...There was a lot of emphasis on 'body beautiful'...Everybody in the house was always dieting and there was a lot of pressure.\" Mixed Media Artist, Brenda Oelbaum When Oelbaum showed her Willendorf Project at ArtPrize in Grand Rapids in 2010, while proudly wearing clothing that celebrated her own curves, the response from women of size was disheartening: They averted their eyes and walked quickly away, unable to recognize either the irony \u2014 or their beauty \u2014 in the display. Continued on Page 50The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 50 Even though Oelbaum was active, spending her summers on horseback and winters skiing, the pressure continued. \"It became more important in high school. I was on diet plans that my parents would pay for. That's what everyone was doing. I remember when my family was on the Scarsdale Diet. I remember when they were on the liquid protein diet. It was the way the family lived. I remember being really excited to move out on my own, because I thought I could do every crazy diet on the planet.\" And she did, with catastrophic results. When each diet ended, weight gain occurred. With the additional weight, she would try a new diet. Over time, Oelbaum suffered from \"every eating disorder under the sun,\" including binge eating, overeating, anorexia, and bulimia, with yo-yo dieting being the greatest disorder of them all. In 1995, after the birth of her second son while living in Ann Arbor, Oelbaum went on another diet, describing it as \"some bag of pills that they would sell at the health food store.\" Not only did they have unpleasant side effects, these pills led to Oelbaum not eating for several months, living only on juice and 500 calories a day. To her family, she appeared anorexic. Then, at her eldest son's birthday party in 1999, she ate one chip and she couldn't stop eating. Her weight gain was \"rapid and scary\" and she finally sought help at Castlewood Treatment Center in St. Louis. While admitting that if she had remained thin, she never would have gone into treatment, Oelbaum says, \"I just needed to get off the crazy wagon I was on, and I did.\" And Oelbaum got off that wagon with a vengeance. She completely stopped dieting. But more importantly, she began to explore herself as an artist. Since childhood, Oelbaum has \"always made art\" and is a classically trained oil painter, with experience painting in Florence, Italy. She has a BFA equivalent from the Ontario College of Art and an MA in Gallery and Retail Art Administration from State University of New York. While she did make and sell a few oil paintings, Oelbaum's eating disorders prevented her from finding her artistic voice. For years, as she focused on how every bite of food would eventually appear on her body, Oelbaum often found herself drawing or cutting out pictures of baby birds with their mouths open. She says, \"It was about hunger...and I was too busy trying to be pretty...Even in my art...the fat and my real body scared me. I could never commit to my body...because it was always changing...So I could never commit to my imagery.\" Then, 9/11 happened. Distraught by both the attacks and public reaction, Oelbaum finally found her voice. And it was a provocative one. Exchanging her paints for fibers, Oelbaum hooked rugs that featured the images of the key political players of the time, including President Bush and Osama bin Laden. She called this first professional exhibit \"The Axis of Evil Rug Series.\" Creating the series was cathartic: Oelbaum could finally consider herself an Artist. But then, something even closer than 9/11 hit home. Oelbaum saw a short-lived commercial for a diet plan. As the Venus of Willendorf \u2014 a 24,000-year old fertility symbol that became an emblem for women's empowerment in the Sixties \u2014 rotated on the screen, a man's voice said, \"You don't want to look like this.\" Offended that a diet company could so desecrate an icon of feminine strength and beauty, Oelbaum decided to return the favor. Calling herself a Fat Feminist Activist Artist and using second-hand diet books, Oelbaum makes paper-mache Venuses. Incorporating several copies of a diet book, such as Stop the Insanity! , Oelbaum layers page after page onto each Venus. As the Venus becomes more round, she is a reflection of how Oelbaum herself \"got fat: it was years and years of dieting and rebounding and messing up my metabolism.\" Oelbaum was recently elected president of the Women's Caucus for Art, a national organization whose mission is \"to create community through art, education, and social activism.\" While her new responsibilities have put her own artwork on hiatus, Oelbaum plans to continue her Willendorf Project , culminating in the grandmother of all Venuses. This definitive Venus will include one copy of every diet book ever written. And she envisions Diet World, a giant maze made out of diet books that reflects the craziness of the diet industry. Oelbaum's ultimate mission, however, is \"to get people to accept themselves where they are.\" She knows how difficult this can be and how judgmental people can be of themselves and others. In fact, when she showed her Willendorf Project at ArtPrize in Grand Rapids in 2010, while proudly wearing clothing that celebrated her own curves, the response from women of size was disheartening: They averted their eyes and walked quickly away, unable to recognize either the irony \u2014 or their beauty \u2014 in the display. It is for these women, especially, that Oelbaum makes her art. She doesn't want anyone else to sustain the damage her body has experienced through dieting and disordered eating. She urges, \"The fact that your body is functioning...it's a beautiful thing...When you are comfortable in your body, it's a wonderful thing...It's a good place!\" Offended that a diet company could so desecrate an icon of feminine strength and beauty, Oelbaum decided to return the favor. Calling herself a Fat Feminist Activist Artist and using second-hand diet books, Oelbaum makes paper-mache copies of the Venus of Willendorf.\"I was on diet plans that my parents would pay for. That's what everyone was doing...I remember being really excited to move out on my own, because I thought I could do every crazy diet on the planet.\"A Body of Artists and Their Bodies at Work Continued from Page 49The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 51 Another artist who is in a good place is Anuja Rajendra, the founder of BollyFit, who lives in Ann Arbor with her husband, Vijay Sankaran, and sons, Chakor and Kabir. She began taking dance lessons at age six with her older sisters, Rachana and Archana, in the Bharat Natyam dance form. Called \"Ballet of the East,\" Bharat Natyam is a 4000-year-old classical dance style. By the time she was 12, Rajendra achieved Arangetram\u2014 a high standard of training, at which point she could dance professionally and teach. Performing with her sisters throughout high school and university as The Rajendra Sisters, Rajendra says, \"It was a lot of fun \u2014 we danced together, always on the side. I mean, we had our academic lives, but this was something we loved to do...it was never pushed on us...and I just adored it. And more than anything, I loved performing and being on stage.\" But when her sister Rachana was killed in a car accident, Rajendra stopped dancing. \"It wasn't a conscious decision that I'm not going to dance,\" she says, \"but it just didn't feel right. A lot of Indian dance is about joy... [and] that part of me was dormant...So much is centered on family, joyous events, and everybody together...I had no interest in it and I was almost numb to that part of me.\" When Rajendra finally began dancing again, it also wasn't conscious: Now the mother of two small boys, she would turn on the music and dance with her sons to pass the time on cold winter days. Then, during a long visit at her in-laws' house, Rajendra stepped back into a classical dance class.\"I just would cry when I was doing it, because I had found that my body had changed and, in my mind, I think I thought it had been one or two years since I had stopped dancing. But it dawned on me that it had been ten, twelve years. I had two kids and two C-sections in the meantime.\" Despite her frustration, Rajendra decided she would begin teaching when she returned to Ann Arbor. BollyFit was born. Taking its inspiration from her original dance style, Bharat Natyam, and also from Bollywood (Hollywood-style dance musicals made in Mumbai, India) and from Bhangra, a Punjabi folk dance, BollyFit's motto is \"fitness through dance.\" The philosophy behind BollyFit is what Rajendra calls Authentic Accessibility. Authentic Accessibility asks the students to be true to themselves in order to access those parts that have been lying dormant, and also offers them access to the experience of the dance and the culture behind it. Rajendra also uses Conscious Choreography, in which every movement has a purpose in the dance, but also connects the students to their spirits. The goal is \"making people feel good within and without.\" However, Rajendra knows that before they begin to feel good on the inside, new students may have to get over the hurdle of feeling self-conscious about moving their bodies, especially their bellies and hips. \"We carry so much on our hips and we tend to look at that part of our body [like] 'my hips are so big'...The hips are part of every woman...and you don't have to have a 24-inch waist to be able to shake it there.\" According to Rajendra, it is the very act of moving the hips that promotes a sense of inner well-being. The students guide their hips with specific hand and arm movements into a kind of release that resembles pushing down unwanted body weight into the earth but, more importantly, gives them \"a lightness within.\" Rajendra says about her students, \"They're okay with the way they are.\" And Rajendra's okay with the way they are. In 2011, when U of M's Athletic Director, David Brandon, introduced Brady Hoke as the new head football coach by saying that spending a few hours with a person can tell you a lot more than relying on a first impression, Rajendra was inspired to create Learn and Love. Initially beginning as a written meet-and-greet for students to get to know new instructors, Learn and Love has expanded into a philosophy that encourages students to share their personal stories with each other. \"When we learn more about others, we realize...something within them...is within us too, some connection. And so we realize we love them as well.\" Although not every student has the same skill level, Rajendra extends this love and energy to BollyFit performances. Rather than showcase only the youngest and most talented dancers, \"all body types, ages, shapes, and sizes\" are accepted and promoted equally. Besides, Rajendra experienced a time when her own body struggled to remember the movements. \"I can look somebody in the eye and say, 'I know how it is if you can't quite do something.'\" Bollyfit's motto is \"fitness through dance.\" The philosophy behind BollyFit is what Rajendra calls Authentic Accessibility... [which] asks the students to be true to themselves, in order to access those parts that have been lying dormant? Rajendra knows that before they begin to feel good on the inside, new students may have to get over the hurdle of feeling self-conscious about moving their bodies, especially their bellies and hips...\"The hips are part of every woman...and you don't have to have a 24-inch waist to be able to shake it there.\" Anuja Rajendra, founder of BollyFit Although not every student has the same skill level, Rajendra extends this love and energy to BollyFit performances. Rather than showcase only the youngest and most talented dancers, \"all body types, ages, shapes, and sizes\" are accepted and promoted equally. Continued on Page 52The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 52 And it is this honesty and acceptance of her body that endears Rajendra to her students. While she is quite petite, she is not immune to body image issues: her C-sections left her with loose skin on her stomach. Although her sons are now seven and five, Rajendra is frequently asked if she is pregnant. While finding clothes can be a challenge, she says, \"Overall, I embrace my body. I have no intention of getting liposuction or anything like that.\" Rajendra also passes her attitude of self-acceptance to the next generation by offering Girls Bhangra. For girls who are just becoming conscious, or even embarrassed, of their developing bodies, Rajendra gives them a safe space to move and to love and accept who they are. Likewise for the adults: BollyFit is \"about literally being comfortable in your own skin and accepting this is where you're at.\" For Molly Nuzzo, an artist and drawing instructor at Eastern Michigan University, \"There is no such thing as an unacceptable body.\" She says, \"As women in our society, our bodies are inherently political, no matter what the size or shape. And the way we use our bodies to express who we are is something that really interests me as an artist.\" Nuzzo confronts society's values of what is considered beautiful for women's bodies in The Becoming Series , a performative drawing process which she photo-documents in three steps. First, Nuzzo paints with her hands directly onto a model's nude body with activated charcoal, in order to alter the model's silhouette as if she were shaving inches from the body. Applying the charcoal sludge with her hands feels ritualistic: it quickly dries into a superfine powder, which the model then partially washes off her body as if she is washing away negative societal expectations. Finally, the remaining charcoal settles into those parts of the body sometimes considered ugly, such as cellulite and stretch marks. But as Nuzzo takes close-up photos, these areas become \"like the most beautiful watercolor paper you could imagine.\" As a queer artist, Nuzzo's work queer identities are expressed physically\" and \"the relationship between body and gender, and how the two can have a correlation or not.\" She believes gender falls along a spectrum, rather than the two usually narrowly defined roles of \"man\" or \"woman,\" and that sexuality itself is \"something that's very fluid.\" It is with this sense of openness and acceptance that she paints in oil on wood \"incredible androgynous...queer and trans[-gender] people.\" Her painting Cristy, for example, depicts a shirtless, masculine woman wearing only jeans and a tie. While Cristy won Best in Show at the Muskegon Museum of Art in 2010, it was not well received by the public. Cristy was censored from a local newspaper that typically prints an image of the winning art piece. And the Muskegon Museum of Art, which had offered Nuzzo a solo showcase, suddenly rescinded, deeming her artwork inappropriate. According to Nuzzo, the issue was not that her model was partially naked, but that it was \"A woman with a fat body who is not adhering to how society expects a woman to present her gender. She's not following the 'rules'. Not only is she unashamed, she is undeniably self-assured. If it bothered people, I hope that it makes them question why it bothered them. And maybe think about the deeper issues at play there. Because these aren't natural, inherent standards of beauty and gender -- these are socially constructed ones, and they're harmful.\" As a girl, Nuzzo herself began to feel pressured by such standards. By the time she was in fifth grade, she was taller than her teacher and had the body of a woman. During this time, she also read a book that told her if she put her hands on her hips and her fingers couldn't touch, she needed to go on a diet. Even though she never did diet as a teen, Nuzzo says, \"I think that I absorbed all the messages that every girl absorbs, [but] I was not conscious of...the way I was being brainwashed to think about my own body. I'm not sure how I escaped it... I don't know, I created my own world, drawing in my room with my door shut.\" What she couldn't escape, however, was the bullying she endured as a senior in high school. Coming out at the age of 17 to the general support of a small group of her family and close friends, people -- not just classmates, but their parents and even some of her teachers in her conservative community -- began to gossip about and harass Nuzzo. She says, \"I have no idea how I did it. I think I just held my breath and gritted my teeth and went to school every morning. I was just in pure survival mode all year. It didn't include physical violence, but it included taunting threats of physical violence and a lot of horrible harassment. But I got through it, graduation removed me from the situation, and the world goes on.\" Continued on Page __ \"Cristy\" by Molly Marie Nuzzo oil on board (40\"x60\") won Best in Show at the Muskegon Museum of Art in 2010 The issue was not that her model was partially naked, but that it was \"A woman with a fat body who is not adhering to how society expects a woman to present her gender...

It is this coming out story \u2014 of being able to access the deepest courage to express her truth \u2014 that is as important as the art itself, and informs all of it. \"There's so much of me in it...I consider myself a queer activist and a feminist, [and] those kinds of issues seep into my work, because that is who I am. I can't really separate those parts of myself.\" Each piece of art that Nuzzo creates, then, is a quiet and personal form of activism, reflecting the ideals that are most important to her \u2014 not just as a woman, but as a person. And as she contemplates using her own body as the next model for The Becoming Series and has embarked on a group of self-portraits, Nuzzo is also exploring the feminine side of gender, in which her model is a feminine man posing as a pin-up model. One thing is certain: Nuzzo and her work embody what it means to be completely accepting of all people and all bodies. Each of these artists embodies this ethic. By being able to look at themselves with honesty and love, by accepting who they truly are, Elizabeth, Brenda, Anuja, and Molly reflect the art of their beauty into the world.

In 1987, when Francine Shapiro was walking in a park, inspiration arrived in much the same way. Thinking about a traumatic event in her life, she noticed that her eyes were moving \u2014 and, as they did, the negative emotions attached to her memories seemed to lessen. Brilliant and curious, Dr. Shapiro began to study this phenomenon, creating a new mode of psychotherapy called Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). Over two decades later, EMDR is a well-researched, expanding therapy with a high success rate that inspires its practitioners \u2014 including five local therapists \u2014 by its ability to heal their clients from trauma. EMDR is a therapy that works with the way information is processed in the brain. All experiences, whether positive or negative, are stored in memory networks that link together all of the thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and images related to each specific experience. EMDR works to diminish negative experiences in one's memory, both \"small-t traumas\" and \"large-T traumas,\" and to enhance or instill positive thoughts in their place. \"Small-t traumas\" are relatively minor, yet continuous, events that occurred in childhood \u2014 such as frequently being called \"stupid\" by a parent \u2014 that have never been resolved, but still negatively influence the beliefs and self-worth of a person. \"Large-T traumas\" are those catastrophic events that have caused a major disturbance in a person's life and psyche. They can be either single-incident traumas, such as almost dying in a car accident or witnessing the death of a fellow soldier during war, or multiple-incident traumas, such as prolonged childhood sexual abuse. Regardless of the type, when confronted with trauma that occurs too often or is too horrible to face, according to the EMDR Resource Center of Michigan, that trauma \"lives...undisturbed in the person's brain, in its original form, generating negative beliefs and perceptions, and containing all the smells, sounds, feelings, and sensations associated with it.\" In essence, what happened in a person's past shapes how he or she feels, thinks, and relates to experiences in the present. The goal of EMDR, then, is threefold: to address the past, present, and future. It takes past trauma and all of its negative connotations and processes them until their influence is lessened. Next, it helps clients identify those associations with the memories that continue to disturb them in the present. Finally, it offers clients the skills they need to move forward into the future. The way EMDR does this is by a treatment plan that covers eight different phases. Depending on the individual client's needs, each phase may consist of one to several sessions, usually lasting between 50 to 90 minutes per session. When the therapist and client meet, the first phase of EMDR - history-taking - begins. The therapist and client identify what the client's specific problem is and how it impacts his life, both currently and historically. The client, however, does not need to describe in detail all aspects of memories that are distressing. Unlike talk therapy, which asks a client to revisit trauma over and over again by talking about it while in session and writing about it at home between sessions \u2014 thereby possibly re-traumatizing the client \u2014 EMDR seeks to focus on the beliefs that a person carries as a result of the trauma.EmDr: rec overing Lives by mo ving out Trauma By Syndy Sweeney Photography by Joni Strickfaden Eye mo vement Carrie Hatcher-Kay EMDR is a well-researched, expanding therapy with a high success rate that inspires its practitioners...by its ability to heal their clients from trauma. ...When confronted with trauma that occurs too often or is too horrible to face, according to the EMDR Resource Center of Michigan, that trauma \"lives...undisturbed in the person's brain, in its original form, generating negative beliefs and perceptions, and containing all the smells, sounds, feelings, and sensations associated with it.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 55 For example, a client may reveal he often feels \"stupid.\" The EMDR therapist would help the client to identify earlier experiences, or typical childhood incidents, that might have led him to hold this belief. Rather than elaborating on how his father used to berate him publicly whenever he participated in sports, the client might simply say, \"I feel stupid because of things my father said to me.\" In EMDR, this is enough information for the therapist to target for treatment. As beliefs are processed, new problems may crop up and this phase can be repeated. As one local EMDR therapist noted, \"The client doesn't often know the origins, it's not an easy or direct question-and-answer about what event led to these feelings, but rather a process of discovery.\" Before helping a client work on a specific traumatic event, the therapist \u2014 in the second phase, Preparation \u2014 needs to make sure that the client is stable and able to cope well with any painful emotions that may arise. Is the client capable of basic self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising? And does he have someone he can talk to between sessions, who can serve as a positive support system? The therapist also helps the client develop internal resources. This can be a safe place that a client creates within his mind that is meaningful to him, where he can retreat when faced with stress and negative emotions. While in this safe place, a client may also create a container, where disturbing thoughts and memories can be safely held \u2014 not forgotten, but out of the way. For many clients, being able to access this safe place may take only one session. For others who have may have suffered from years of abuse and have issues with trust, this stabilization phase may take a long time, over a period of months. After working together to increase safety and trust, the client is better prepared to move forward to the third phase, Assessment. This phase assesses the client's beliefs, images, emotions, disturbance level and sensations about the event. The therapist asks the client for his worst belief about the event, in relation to himself. Using the example above, the client might say, \"I am the stupidest man on earth,\" or \"I'm not seen/important,\" or \"I am not safe.\" The therapist then asks the client to rate how disturbing this belief is by using the 0 to 10 Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUD) scale, with 0 being no disturbance at all and 10 being the most disturbing belief. For most clients in EMDR, the disturbance is at least 5, if not higher. The client is also asked to become aware of the emotions he feels and the sensations that he may be experiencing in his body \u2014 such as cramping in the stomach, legs bouncing as if they want to run away, or an increased heart rate \u2014 while examining this negative belief. The therapist then asks the client to think about becoming completely freed from the pain of the event: What positive belief could he then imagine substituting for his negative one? In the above example, perhaps it would be something like, \"I did the best I could.\" When the client has settled on a better belief, the therapist asks him to rate it, as well \u2014 this time, using the 1 to 7 Validity of Cognition (VOC) scale, with 1 meaning \"completely false\" and 7 being \"completely true.\" Usually, before reprocessing begins, the client may view this positive belief as a 1 or 2; it's a belief he'd like to have, but currently does not. The ultimate goal of EMDR is to have a client rate his negative beliefs much lower (from 0 to 2) with his new, positive beliefs much higher (6 or 7). After the memory is fully accessed and the pump is primed for processing, and after rating the beliefs, then the therapist and client can move into the fourth phase, or Desensitization. Based on Dr. Shapiro's original discovery \u2014 that eye movements reduce the anguish of distressing memories \u2014 this phase uses a methodology unique to EMDR: bilateral stimulation of the brain's hemispheres. While the client focuses on the physical sensations, images, and negative thoughts related to his traumatic event, his eyes follow the movements of a light bar, or the therapist's fingers, for about 30 seconds. However, research into EMDR has discovered that moving the eyes is not the only way for bilateral stimulation to occur. Other methods, such as alternating tones played through headphones or the therapist tapping the client's hands one after the other, have been found to be just as effective. Whichever method is used depends purely on the preference of the client and the therapist. This process creates something like an opening in the brain in which dual attention occurs: as the client is engaged in the bilateral stimulation while focusing on the traumatic event, he is also asked to be aware of any other emotions and thoughts that may crop up. {It is thought that the brain is re-working and re-shuffling the memories and meanings and associated emotions and sensations between the emotional (right-brain) and analytical (left brain) during both the active bilateral stimulation as well as during the breaks between the 30-second sets.} After the stimulation is over, the client discusses this new awareness and also re-examines his worst belief. How does he rate it now? Has it decreased, increased, or stayed the same? What new associations with the traumatic event have been revealed? Depending on the client's response, the therapist will repeat the stimulation, changing the focus if needed. This processing phase may last one or multiple sessions. As the therapist sees that the associations are shifting towards less disturbing and more adaptive perspectives on the event(s), then it is time to re-assess disturbance level. Once the client's SUD rating is at least a 2 or below (with the final objective being 0), the client will have resolved his negative beliefs about his trauma. The original positive belief is re-assessed, and most likely it has begun to strengthen. At this point, phase five, Installation, begins. While the client thinks about the positive belief that he originally established (in the above example, \"I did the best I could\") \u2014 or an even better belief that may have emerged through processing (such as, \"I am intelligent\") \u2014 and simultaneously focuses on his trauma, the therapist will again conduct bilateral stimulation. After this 30-second session, the client is once again asked to weigh in on what he is feeling and thinking. How does he now rate this new, positive belief? Has it become true for him or is it still a false belief that he'd like to have, but doesn't? The idea is to strengthen this positive belief until it is at least a 6 or 7 on the VOC scale. This process of strengthening the positive belief is critical to getting the full benefit of re-working memories in EMDR. By transforming one's perspective on the traumatic event, the client heals, and also, according to one local therapist, \"gains deep wisdom and empathy for the human condition.\" After the positive belief is strengthened, the therapist asks the client to scan his body. EMDR recognizes that trauma occurs not just in the intelligence, but also manifests in \u2014 and must be processed from \u2014 the body. In this sixth phase, Body Scan, when the client thinks back to his trauma, how does he presently feel in his body? Is there pain or tension in the body? How is he holding his posture? Is the heart rate elevated or steady? Is there any anxiety? The goal is for the client to be able to think about his trauma without feeling corresponding disturbing sensations in his body. If he still feels physical sensations, then bilateral stimulation is used once again; he and the therapist continue to process until he is no longer does. The seventh phase is called Closure. Ending every session, the objective is to have the client feeling better than when he arrived. This also extends to the time between sessions. If any additional thoughts, feelings, or sensations relating to the trauma appear after the session, the client is asked to take note of them, so they can be processed in future sessions. If those emotions become too difficult, the client is reminded to return to the safe place he created and to utilize the self-care techniques he developed earlier in his treatment. Finally, the eighth phase, Reevaluation, begins the next (and every) session. Here, the therapist and client re-evaluate the client's progress. Is his rating of the negative belief still low?

While the client focuses on the physical sensations, images, and negative thoughts related to his traumatic event, his eyes follow the movements of a light bar, or the therapist's fingers, for about 30 seconds. However, research into EMDR has discovered that moving the eyes is not the only way for bilateral stimulation to occur. Other methods, such as alternating tones played through headphones or the therapist tapping the client's hands one after the other, have been found to be just as effective.Because of its lasting results, EMDR has been \"strongly recommended\" or considered a \"treatment of choice\" for trauma by the Department of Defense, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychiatric Association.,The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 56 In the previous example, the client may have been able to completely process the feelings of stupidity in relation to his father and now believes that yes, he is, in fact, intelligent. In processing this event, however, perhaps he remembered another situation in which similar feelings of humiliation came up, such as a teacher who announced he failed the test and his classmates laughed at him. This associative memory would then be processed in the same way as the original traumatic event. Once all of the associative memories are processed, the client will have succeeded in being able to put a lifetime of feelings and memories of stupidity (and humiliation) into the back of his brain, until they no longer disturb him in the present moment and no longer prevent him from moving forward into the future. While the process of EMDR may seem complicated, many of the phases overlap in a single session. And for many people, especially those suffering from single-incident traumas, their treatment can be completed in as little as six sessions. Research has shown that the healing that clients can achieve with EMDR lasts long after the treatment is completed. Because her initial discovery of EMDR was met with skepticism, Dr. Shapiro began testing the efficacy of EMDR. She and the EMDR Institute (which she founded in 1990 in order to train others in EMDR methodology) continue to welcome outside research, no matter what the results may be. In 2006, the EMDR Research Foundation was founded to further invest in the development and dissemination of EMDR research. To that end, there have been over 20 randomized, controlled studies done on EMDR that show positive results. For example, a study funded by Kaiser Permanente in 1997 ( Marcus, S., Marquis, P . & Sakai, C. ) looked at treating people with Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in an HMO healthcare setting. After six 50-minute sessions of EMDR, 100 percent of the single-incident trauma and 80 percent of the multiple-incident trauma victims no longer suffered from PTSD. A year later, another study of combat veterans suffering from PTSD (Carlson, J., Chemtob, C.M., Rusnak, K., Hedlund, N.L, after 12 sessions of EMDR, PTSD was eliminated in 77 percent of the veterans and these results were still maintained when a follow-up was conducted. Because of its lasting results, EMDR has been \"strongly recommended\" or considered a \"treatment of choice\" for trauma by the Department of Defense, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychiatric Association, as well as numerous international boards, including the Israeli National Council for Mental Health; the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety; and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. Despite its effectiveness in treating trauma and the research being done on EMDR, what is still unknown is exactly how it works. It seems to access the areas of the brain where the fear response lies \u2014 the amygdala and cerebrum \u2014 and calms them down, allowing for new associations and pathways to be grooved in the brain. Also, the eye movements used in EMDR may replicate the same processes that occur when a person is in Rapid Eye Movement or REM sleep, when the mind is relaxed enough to process its memories. However, it is not necessary to know how EMDR works to accept the evidence that it works very well. Not only do therapists use it with great success to treat their clients, but, because their two-part EMDR training requires them to undergo EMDR sessions themselves, they understand firsthand the beauty in being able to release their own traumatic events. Witnessing this release of trauma and all of its negative beliefs is what ultimately inspires five highly trained Ann Arbor therapists who make EMDR their own and who give back to the field that continues to give them so much.Despite its effectiveness in treating trauma and the research being done on EMDR, what is still unknown is exactly how it works.

Graduating in 1975 with a master's degree from the University of Michigan's Social Work program, Vozar began his career as a children's counselor. By 1990, he was the administrator of a child and family agency in Adrian. While he was good at his job, he realized he missed the direct connection with people that being a therapist provided, so he decided to go into private practice.Older and not as easily able to get down on the floor to meet child clients at their level, Vozar turned his attention to working with adults and families. But it could be frustrating. \"I was working with people with trauma and I wasn't having the kind of success I wanted with them. I could see that just talking, that just simple talk therapy, was insufficient.\" In 1991, just a few years after EMDR was developed and before a certification process had been formally established, Vozar became trained in EMDR and his practice changed. \"I started using it after that,\" he says, \"and I really had very good results.\" Vozar saw the opportunity to develop and expand on the internal resources used in EMDR. A Taoist with daily practices in meditation, chi kung (cultivating and balancing life energy), and tai chi (a slow-moving internal Chinese martial art), Vozar gravitated to accessing his clients' spiritual beliefs as part of their healing. Besides creating a safe place and a container, Vozar and his clients \"co-create a poetry of healing and spiritual connection\" by constructing three additional internal resources that are not usually part of the standard EMDR protocol: spiritual, protective, and nurturing resources. According to Vozar, a spiritual resource is simply one's connection to a higher power, whatever that higher power may or may not be called. When processing trauma, if a client becomes overwhelmed, Vozar has the client access his safe place. While there, Vozar asks if his client can connect to his spiritual resource. If he can, what would his higher power say about the client's experience? Can the higher power comfort the client through the processing? The nurturing and protective resources may also have a spiritual component to them. Vozar says, \"Some people would see the Virgin Mary, for example, as a nurturing resource. Some of the Hindu gods are quite protective. So it really depends on the person.\" However, the nurturing and protective resources could have an emotional attachment, rather than a spiritual one. For example, a client's protective resource could be an image of Wonder Woman or Bruce Lee; while a nurturing one may be represented by a mother bear with her cub or a warm embrace of light. Vozar also uses the protective and nurturing resources to help the client enhance his or her own qualities, like the capacity for compassion and empathy on one hand, and the ability to be assertive and take action on the other. When the client may be facing a difficult moment during processing, she can remember that not only does she have internal resources to protect and nurture herself through it, she herself actually embodies their qualities. In the midst of feeling overwhelmed, having the ability to acknowledge her strengths can be an additional powerful tool to help a person heal from trauma. c Cam Vozar \"I was working with people with trauma and I wasn't having the kind of success I wanted with them. I could see that just talking, that just simple talk therapy, was insufficient.\" - \u2014 Cam VozarA Taoist with daily practices in meditation, chi kung (cultivating and balancing life energy), and tai chi (a slow-moving internal Chinese martial art), Vozar gravitated to accessing his clients' spiritual beliefs as part of their healing...According to Vozar, a spiritual resource is simply one's connection to a higher power, whatever that higher power may or may not be called.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 57 It was Vozar's personal internal resources and EMDR that were \"invaluable\" in guiding him out of his own trauma. In 2005, this father of three adult children lost his wife to cancer. He says, \"It is interesting that your mind really does start thinking differently in the EMDR state and it's able to make some different connections to heal the trauma.\" These connections have helped him move forward. Vozar is now in \"a loving relationship with a strong spiritual bond.\" Involved with various tai chi associations, he also gives back by teaching tai chi at the Cancer Support Community. Whether it is the way he lives his life or helps his clients to make sense of theirs, Vozar can't help but bring a deeper, spiritual sense to his practice. Because, for him, therapy isn't just about healing from trauma, it's about allowing \"a more authentic and spiritual self\" to rise up from that trauma. c A generous and authentic spirit also infuses the practice of Deborah Kennard. A recent transplant from Monroe to Ann Arbor, Kennard began working in community mental health after she graduated in 1994 with a master's degree in clinical psychology from Eastern Michigan University. Two years later, she went into private practice and one of the members of her group suggested she look into EMDR. When she went to her first EMDR training in 1996, Kennard had never been in therapy. When it came time for the practicum in which she would experience EMDR for herself, she says, \"I was thinking, 'I can't even think of anything [to work on].'\" Then Kennard remembered a moment when she was 16 years old. She had made plans to meet her mother at a mall. In a time before cell phones, Kennard could not find her mother in or outside of the mall. Upset, she drove home crying. In her EMDR training, processing this memory revealed feelings of abandonment and a fear of becoming an orphan, both of which stemmed from her father's death shortly before her second birthday. She says, \"I was able to process it and then I went from there to go on to get more help, to get more EMDR, and it was really helpful.\" EMDR has also given Kennard a \"larger success rate\" in working with her clients, many of whom have suffered from some of the most heartbreaking and severe traumas. They come from complex family systems in which trauma plays out in the history of a family. Or they may be carrying ancestral trauma, resulting from such tragedies as the Holocaust. Kennard says, \"It's just really amazing once we start to process...You can see that line of how that pain has been passed on from generation to generation. And how amazing it is to see the healing that's done and it really feels like you're reaching back [into the previous generations].\" In her practice, which is mostly referral based, she often treats victims of sexual abuse. She also works with perpetrators and is able to do so without passing judgment. \"What happens with EMDR...is that we really understand everything that is happening. Even if it's a perpetrator sitting in my office...I understand everything that person has been through,\" she says. She extends this understanding to volunteer work. For the last four years, Kennard has been a trainer for the EMDR Humanitarian Assistance Program (EMDR HAP). A nonprofit organization funded by donations and founded in 1995, HAP is a network of EMDR-trained therapists who work with community mental health or other non-profits in areas that are underserved or have been hit by natural or man-made disasters, both in the United States and worldwide. While their expenses are paid, all HAP volunteers donate their time and expertise to train other therapists in EMDR, so those therapists can turn around and help heal their communities from trauma.With HAP , Kennard travels to conduct trainings with therapists, usually once a month. Last year, she was in New Orleans, training therapists who work with veterans; in Nashville, which experienced severe flooding several years ago; and in Fort Collins, Colorado, training therapists from agencies all over Colorado and some from surrounding states who work in areas with trauma or in underserved communities. While in Fort Collins, Kennard also trained a local EMDR trainer. This was a few months before the mass shooting at the Batman movie premiere. \"We [now] have a team of trainers in that area that help organize assistance for any disaster, including the Batman incident,\" says Kennard. Kennard also donates her time to the EMDR International Association (EMDRIA) as the EMDRIA Regional Coordinator for Michigan and Northwest Ohio. Founded in 1995, EMDRIA is a professional membership organization that sets the standards and certification process for EMDR, as well as provides a professional journal and annual conference to its members. As a regional coordinator, Kennard manages an e-mail list and helps EMDR-trained therapists to continue their education by bringing in additional training. Whether working or volunteering, Kennard brings her \"whole self\" into her practice. She's studied shamanism and Buddhist psychology and is able to draw connections between these disciplines and EMDR to complement her practice. For example, EMDR seeks to discover the root of one's trauma. In Buddhist psychology, Kennard says, this root is similar to sankharas or the stored patterns of one's past that, \"when conditions are right...may surface again.\" Or it resembles the soul retrieval found in shamanic healing, in which part of a person's soul may leave when faced with trauma. With shamanism, as in EMDR, the goal is to make the person whole again. Kennard also does drum journeying. For some of her clients, especially children who have been internationally adopted and are having problems attaching to their new families, she uses her floor drum as her tool for bilateral stimulation. She says, \"Each of us will sit on one side of it. [With] drumming...you're still receiving the bilateral stimulation that is vibrating into your hand.\" Besides, it's a lot of fun for both Kennard and her young clients. Reiki also finds its way into Kennard's practice. While she's never practiced Reiki as a profession, she has been trained in it. It helps her to connect to the energy of her clients and \u2014 along with doing her own EMDR work and practicing meditation \u2014 it's a way for her to heal as well. And it is this ability to take care of her health and well-being that keeps Kennard continuing in her chosen field. \"I can tolerate anything in my office,\" she says. \"Someone who may have been tortured or they've seen horrible things; I've heard the worst of the worst.\" But in her down time, even the smallest amount of violence is intolerable to Kennard and she mostly avoids watching television or the news. Kennard also has the love and support of her husband, Stan, and her three adult sons, Harris, Lee, and Spencer. According to their mother, \"They all have a big heart...they're good people.\" Deborah Kennard Kennard says, \"It's just really amazing once we start to process... You can see that line of how that pain has been passed on from generation to generation. And how amazing it is to see the healing that's done and it really feels like you're reaching back [into the previous generations].\" With the EMDR Humanitarian Assistance Program, Kennard travels to conduct trainings with therapists, usually once a month. Last year, she was in New Orleans, training therapists who work with veterans; in Nashville, which experienced severe flooding several years ago; and in Fort Collins, Colorado, training therapists from agencies all over Colorado. Continued on page 58The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 58 But what protects Kennard the most from becoming burned-out is hope. She says, \"I really do think hope...is a great protection for me...It really helps. And I do see them [my clients] progress, which is really a wonderful honor. What a great thing to have a job where you can see people healing!\" Kennard is currently developing a community website in which EMDR trainers can talk to people. Called the Center for Personal Transformation, the theme of this website is how to actively open up the heart in order to discover one's path in life. \"That's really how I see my clients,\" Kennard says. \"What they really need is to get whatever there is out of the way that keeps them from having an open heart, from just being who they are, and connecting with their essence. EMDR is really a great tool for that.\"EmDr: rec overing Lives by mo ving out Trauma Continued from page 57 c When Dr. Carrie Hatcher-Kay first heard about EMDR in graduate school, she didn't think she'd have a use for it. \"I thought it was so odd,\" she admits. As she earned her doctorate of psychology from the University of Michigan in 2001 and went on to do two years of post-doctorate work at UM Department of Psychiatry, she didn't give EMDR much more thought. Then in 2002, one of her colleagues, whom she highly respected, had a car accident. As her friend healed through EMDR and went on to become trained in it, Hatcher-Kay investigated EMDR further and found that she, too, could be healed from an earlier trauma. When she was 30 years old, a tragedy (that Hatcher-Kay prefers to remain private) occurred. At the time, she processed it through traditional therapy, but it was still \"gripping.\" Processing her loss through EMDR changed that. It was, she says, \"like moving from an active gash on your body to a scar that is a memory but it is faded, it's not actively hurting...It's got its place in the fabric of your skin, your story. And that's what I experienced. And so I quickly felt compelled to pursue this training and offer it to numerous clients that I could immediately think of helping.\" Hatcher-Kay didn't have to go far, nor wait long, to pursue EMDR training: shortly after her epiphany, EMDR training came to Ann Arbor. That was in 2005. And then three years ago, she attended a local EMDR training which introduced her not only to a new way of doing EMDR, but to a new passion: Sensorimotor Psychotherapy (SP). When the sixth phase of EMDR treatment asks a client to check in with the sensations he is feeling in his body, SP enhances that EMDR protocol by allowing the client to make contact with his body in ways that go beyond the protocol \u2014 beyond the intellect and emotions \u2014 to a place of curious mindfulness about the body. According to Hatcher-Kay, SP \"allows people to learn more about that core experience that's stored in the body.\" While the body may have manifested pain or disease as a result of trauma, the body may also have simply created ways of being or holding itself as strategies just to get by in life. Those life strategies could manifest as tension carried in the shoulders, difficulty making eye contact, a slight pulling away from other people when standing too close to them, or even talking too quickly. A person may have developed the strategy of talking too fast, for example, because slowing down may feel dangerous \u2014 connecting the person to difficult emotions she is trying to avoid. The process Hatcher-Kay uses to help guide her clients into greater body awareness is almost meditative. First, she invites the client to turn inward and notice how her body feels and what it is doing. Then, she will mirror the client's posture. If the client is hunched slightly or has her legs crossed, she will quietly do the same. The client may not even be consciously aware of Hatcher-Kay's new posture, but she may be sensing what she herself looks like. She may call attention to the client's posture or, if it shifts, to that shift. But she and the client do not judge the shift or even analyze it. As Hatcher-Kay says, \"We notice together with curiosity.\" As this shift occurs, the voice may slow down and, moment-by-moment, the client is noticing the impulses of her body. In trauma, those impulses are usually defensive \u2014 a need to fight or escape, or to freeze or collapse. A person may freeze in her chair or her shoulders may rise and fists clench, indicating an impulse to fight. Hatcher-Kay watches this reaction, pointing out that it is a precursor to movement, and she and the client process through it. That might include giving the client a pillow to push away or hold, or to work through the tension in her body. If the client's body is reacting as if it wants to run away, Hatcher-Kay may invite her to walk around in the room. She'll often mirror the client's pace. And processing the bodily reactions in this way creates a greater opening and connection to the earlier experience that didn't just occur in the mind or the emotions, but settled in the body when the client was unable to protect herself. According to Hatcher-Kay, this process begins to \"settle, to work through that stuck-ness of that incomplete action [the inability of self-protection], as well as deepen and affirm that this really happened.\"The results are profound. With this release from the body, there is often grief for having lived for so long with trauma and its myriad effects. But, according to Hatcher-Kay, \"The tears that flow in grieving are healing, as the client recognizes what was missed, but also senses the possibility of moving on.\" She adds that the client's traumatic experiences then become \"woven into the background fabric of the tapestry of life, whereas before they may have been overwhelmingly in the foreground.\" SP has so transformed Hatcher-Kay's EMDR practice that she has formed Partners in Healing with two other colleagues to offer opportunities for other therapists to train in integrating mind-body approaches in psychotherapy. They have become the Michigan liaisons for the Sensorimotor Psychotherapy Institute and hope to help host a training here starting in 2014. Hatcher-Kay also incorporates into her practice another adaptation of EMDR: Induced After-Death Communication (IADC). An intensive grief psychotherapy, it asks the client to be willing to plunge into sadness after the death of a loved one. This therapy is not for everyone: Hatcher-Kay does an assessment to make sure that her clients are not actively depressed (as distinguished from grieving) and that they are able to access their internal resources and to take care of themselves. In IADC, the therapist keeps returning the client to the sadness to process deeper parts of it. The sessions are extended and occur two to three days in a row, in order to maintain access to the intensity of the experience and reduce everyday defenses from popping up and interfering with the \"moving through\" process. What happens, according to Hatcher-Kay, is \"profoundly beautiful.\" The client's connection to his loved one begins to shift from sadness to a deeper connection, in which joy can return. \"Some people might call it spiritual,\" she says. \"Some experience it as light. Some experience it as that person saying something to them. Some experience it as humor, with memories of good times with their loved one returning.\" Hatcher-Kay recalls a mother who had lost her son and, after her intense processing was over, she experienced him present in the room in the form of sparks of light and warmth, in which he told her everything was going to be okay. \"It's so beautiful,\" this married mother of two young children says. \"I want to do more of these. It's so beautiful.\" Dr. Carrie Hatcher-Kay Sensorimotor Psychotherapy (SP) enhances that EMDR protocol by allowing the client to make contact with his body in ways that go beyond the protocol \u2014 beyond the intellect and emotions \u2014 to a place of curious mindfulness about the body. According to Carrie Hatcher-Kay, SP \"allows people to learn more about that core experience that's stored in the body.\" Hatcher-Kay also incorporates into her practice another adaptation of EMDR: Induced After-Death Communication (IADC). An intensive grief psychotherapy, it asks the client to be willing to plunge into sadness after the death of a loved one... The client's connection to his loved one begins to shift from sadness to a deeper connection, in which joy can return. cThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 59 Dr. Zona Scheiner agrees: \"EMDR can be addictive.\" Scheiner first read about EMDR in the early 1990s and \"it sounded intriguing, but a bit strange.\" Then in 1996, at the urging of one of her colleagues whose brother-in-law was an early adapter of EMDR, Scheiner took her first training. Although she had been a family and couples therapist for over 20 years by that point, EMDR intensified her passion for her practice. She says, \"It wasn't until I learned EMDR that I could say to people \u2014 and this is not all people all the time, but to enough people enough of the time \u2014 that you do not have to live with this [trauma]. We can do something...You do not have to walk around with this on an ongoing basis. For psychotherapists, that is a pretty extraordinary thing to be able to say.\" Bennet Wolper, Scheiner's husband and partner in their practice, Family Therapy Associates, \"wasn't immediately grabbed by\" EMDR, however. After his wife returned from her initial training, she talked a lot about EMDR. Wanting to connect with what had become so important to his wife, Wolper decided to pursue his own training. He admits, \"I did not have a knock-down, drop-dead, fabulous experience.\" Then, the couple decided to take the second part of EMDR training together. Held in Philadelphia, and conducted by Dr. Shapiro herself, Wolper's \"practicum experience was very profoundly moving. It really connected with me personally.\" While preferring to keep the details of what he processed private, Wolper was able to release a heightened \u2014 and what he calls \"irrational\" \u2014 sense of responsibility for others that had resulted from his own traumatic experiences. What EMDR released for Scheiner in her practicum, however, was not so much feelings associated with trauma, but her self-esteem. While it did not happen every day or even every week, for most of her life, whenever Scheiner felt badly or thought she didn't perform well, she was unable to look at her body with honesty. She says, \"I used to joke that I could gain 20 pounds in a day...I would look at myself in the mirror, and I would see a different person.\" It wasn't until two or three months after her EMDR training that Scheiner became aware that what she had processed in her EMDR practicum had stuck with her. She and Wolper presented a couples' workshop and, after it was over, they decided they hadn't really done their best work. They talked about it for a few hours and suddenly, Scheiner realized, \"I didn't gain any weight!\" Because of EMDR, she was able to disconnect the experience of not performing her job well from the way she saw her body. Continued on page 60 Dr. Zona Scheiner Scheiner says, \"It wasn't until I learned EMDR that I could say to people \u2014 and this is not all people all the time, but to enough people enough of the time \u2014 that you do not have to live with this [trauma].

And even though we're not friends, in this moment of time, we're walking down this particular road together in a way that is very, very unique. That nobody \u2014 nobody \u2014 shares that kind of experience with them. It is an incredibly meaningful experience for the therapist.\" And because EMDR has been so significant for both Wolper and Scheiner, they volunteer with the many organizations that expand and support the field of EMDR. Says Wolper, \"There is a profound gratitude for what it has done for us as professionals, to be able to do more effectively that which we dedicated our professional lives to do.\" Scheiner concurs, \"It's been a profession that has given so much back to us, you find ways to give to it.\" As such, both Scheiner and Wolper are EMDR HAP trainers, working both domestically and internationally. Scheiner has even worked in Germany helping psychiatrists who themselves had been traumatized from their efforts working in refugee camps in Kosovo. And, currently, Scheiner sits on the board of directors for the EMDR Research Foundation. The couple also volunteers for EMDRIA. Scheiner served on the board of directors from 1999 to 2005 and became its president in 2006. Beginning in 1998, Wolper was a member of EMDRIA's Standards and Training Committee for 10 years, even serving as its co-chair. And he has been involved in its special projects, such as defining EMDR and developing its curriculum. Currently, Wolper is on the Conference Committee, which oversees EMDR conferences. In addition to helping clients and volunteering, Scheiner and Wolper also act as regional trainers for the EMDR Institute. Because the Institute's training is two-tiered (consisting of two three-day sessions), therapists can attend the first training in one city and the second training months or even a year later in another city. What Wolper and Scheiner bring to the way they train is intimacy and consistency. Therapists who want to be trained in EMDR sign up for the entire training process at once, committing to three weekends (one three-day intensive and two two-day sessions). For the trainees, this gives them an opportunity for their work to build upon itself. It also fosters a community: because the trainees tend to be from the same area, they can meet in between weekends and bounce ideas off of each other. What also makes a difference to their training is the fact that Scheiner and Wolper really enjoy working together. \"I think we're kind of funny,\" Scheiner says, \"and people seem to enjoy the relationship.\" Wolper agrees, \"To have your best friend also as a colleague is pretty cool...I couldn't imagine doing it another way.\" They're not immune to disagreements, however. But to keep those to a minimum, these parents of two and grandparents of five take separate cars to their office. \"I know this is a very un-green thing to say,\" Scheiner laughs, \"[but] we drive in our own way, on our own route, with our own music on the radio, and don't have to talk to anybody else.\" Although Wolper and Scheiner are cutting back a bit with their schedules, their passion for EMDR still drives them. Scheiner says it best: \"The intensity of my passion has ...probably increased \u2014 which is, I think, pretty unusual. As I say, our EMDR keeps people working long past any reasonable retirement age!\" ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ From the beginning \u2014 when Frances Shapiro's higher awareness helped her to look at her trauma with fresh eyes \u2014 to the present day, when the therapy she created fills its practitioners with passion and an ability to truly help people out of their pain and trauma, EMDR can only be called one thing: inspirational.EmDr: rec overing Lives by mo ving out Trauma Continued from page 59The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 60 \"What is occurring is that people were traumatized and all alone and they have defended against exposure to that experience to the best they've been able to [in] their life,\" Wolper says. \"And they enter into a relationship with an EMDR therapist...nobody \u2014 nobody \u2014 shares that kind of experience with them.

Photography by Gregory Fox I knocked on the door and a man answered and invited me in. He said his name was Hank. He was the husband of the patient I was going to meet for the first time that day. I am an R.N. and I had been assigned as the case manager for a 56-year-old woman named Maryanne. She had a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Hank told me his wife was upstairs, would I like a cup of coffee before I went up to meet her? I like to get to know the family early into my relationship with my clients and accepted his invitation.Hospice is a collaborative venture with the patient, family, and hospice staff. Hospice provides the teaching and the medical supplies needed for end of life care. Nursing, social work, chaplaincy, and volunteer staff offer physical, emotional, and spiritual care and support when they visit, but family and friends are the primary care providers. They are the ones there 24/7 to meet the daily needs of that person and support them through the dying process. They will likely be at bedside when their loved one dies; they will dial the phone and make the call to hospice when that happens. I sat down, took my coffee with cream, and Hank and I chatted. He was a nice man and quite a talker. After about ten minutes or so of small talk, I thanked him for the coffee, got up from the kitchen table, and went up the stairs to meet his wife. I had no idea then what an adventure I had ahead of me. Maryanne was a matter of fact \"don't bullshit me\" (her first words to me after hello) woman. \"How long do I have to live?\" followed shortly after my Avon-lady pitched \"hi, my name is Mary, I'm your nurse\" intro. Apparently no time was going to be spent here chit-chatting with Maryanne. When I mentioned how I enjoyed meeting her husband, Hank, she remarked that I had \"talked more with Hank in the last ten minutes\" than she had \"in the last ten years.\" Interesting \u2014 particularly since Hank was ultimately going to assume the role of her primary caregiver. I stumbled through that first visit with Maryanne. No touchy feel-ly stuff wafting in the air. No hand holding. She wanted a schedule of when I would be visiting, a list of the meds she would be taking, and she wanted to be kept informed on how long she had to live and how she would die. She wanted specifically to know what would happen physiologically that would cause her death. \"Don't spare any details,\" she instructed. So we made a schedule for my visits, we reviewed her medications, and I agreed to be totally honest and straightforward with the information she wanted from me. She had clearly defined what she wanted from hospice and I was clearly committed to providing hospice care for her, her way. The dance had begun. Early in my visits with Maryanne, and then at every visit, she was very insistent that I keep increasing the dose of her Morphine and Ativan. I would bring her request to our hospice doctor and her pain and anti-anxiety medications were taken up per her request. Pain and anxiety are what the patient says they are, and hospice is about meeting comfort needs and managing pain. But on my visits after these increases in dosage, all I ever observed was my patient getting more and more \"dopey.\" On one of these visits she slurred out the question, \"How long 'til I die?\" I'd gotten to know her well enough by then to know how to answer that one. We had actually established a good rapport and had discussed many of her beliefs about life and death. I told her, \"Well, unless you drown from drooling, or pass out and fall into your oatmeal and meet the same fate, I suspect it is going to be awhile yet.\" That woke her up a bit. I explained graphically, as I agreed at the beginning I would, that physiologically her body still had body fat to burn, and it had the ability to use that fat for energy. Her body was not burning muscle yet. Her heart was a muscle and it was strong. I was speaking her language. I knew we were connecting. \"As far as I can see,\" I said, \"you're not leaving any time soon.\" It was an effective pattern interrupt. She opened her eyes and looked at me. Tears flowed. She needed to cry, something she said \"did not come easy\" for her, and with that I knew a shift in her perception had occurred; she understood she was going to die \u2014 but she got it! She was not dead yet! I upheld my agreement to honor her wishes and not sugarcoat anything. I had earned her trust. I was not there to take over her life; I was there to walk with her through this part of it. Maryanne was able to admit to herself and to me that it wasn't physical pain, but fear, she was trying to medicate away, and it was not working. We spent time talking about how she wanted to do this part of her life, beyond the anatomy/physiology updates. I asked her if she would like to explore ways to manage the pain by dealing with some of the fear. She said yes. It was here the first \"touchy feel-ly\" heart opening occurred between us \u2014 and it was at her invitation. She offered me her hand, and I took it. I believe at that point Grace spun its magic, and the dignity Maryanne and Maryanne's family deserved to experience at her end of life journey began. Maryanne was a part of the Baha'i faith. Friends from her congregation would come to visit. They brought food and little gifts of inspirational readings to offer When I mentioned how I enjoyed meeting her husband, Hank, she remarked that I had \"talked more with Hank in the last ten minutes\" than she had \"in the last ten years.\" Combing Her Hair ~ A Hospice Worker Reflects on Dying with Dignity and GraceMary DeLisle-Berry 20 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 63 support to her. She had been involved for years with the Baha'i faith and a very active member in their local community. She told me she had always found strength and purpose for her life integrating her faith into her everyday life, but, when she was diagnosed with cancer, her entire focus had gotten stuck on \"when and how will I die?\" She wasn't able to take in love and comfort from her friends. When they came over she was \"drugged.\" Sometimes she would sleep through their visits. When she was awake, she obsessed about the details of the disease. She could not quiet her mind long enough to focus on anything else. While her actual physical pain was managed very well, her spiritual pain was raging, and her source for addressing that pain was blocked. None of the drugs she was taking could manage that kind of pain. Because she had agreed to try some alternative symptom management, I suggested guided imagery. Perhaps she could relax and that would open a pathway for her to quiet her mind and find strength again in the things that had sustained her throughout her life. She was very receptive to that idea. She had used hypnosis many years prior to quit smoking and was pleased at how well that had worked for her. A session of guided imagery was held at her bedside and taped for her. It was scripted by her, for her, specifically using her favorite imaginings. Thoughts and ideas that brought her peace of mind and hope were used to help her remember how she had lived her life before fear had taken over. I remember very well one story she wanted on that tape to help her relax. She said her father was a fisherman. When she was a little girl she would sit on the dock and watch for him to come in with his boat at the end of the day. It was a carefree time in her life when she felt safe and loved, and so that was the story we used to promote relaxation on the tape. We put some of her favorite poems, songs, and spiritual quotes into the tape as well. It was her tape, done her way. She loved it! She listened to it when she felt anxious, when she went to sleep at night, and when she wanted to catnap during the day. She fell into the experience of relaxing with it. And, slowly over the weeks that followed, she had us wean her medications down to levels that managed her pain, yet allowed her to be present and alert for her life. She started enjoying the visits from her friends. She was even talking to Hank. One day when I came to visit, Hank was combing her hair. It made me cry. Not all of my experiences in hospice have been so dramatic, but they have all been unique \u2014 and sacred. Seeing \"don't bullshit me\" Maryanne having her hair brushed by a man she said she \"had barely spoken to in the last ten years\" touched me deeply. Later, after her death, when I met her two grown daughters at the funeral, they told me of some very amazing conversations they had with their mom during those months prior to her death. They told me how \"stunned\" they were observing tenderness between their parents during that time. One daughter said her mom and dad seemed to have \"fallen in love again\" \u2014 something she never thought she would see. I honestly do not know how all that healing happened between them. Maryanne and Hank must have called a truce to the silence and made peace with each other. And he did become her caregiver, bathing her, helping to feed her, and sitting vigil many hours at her bedside. It was Hank who made the call to hospice when she died. As I reflect on what occurred, I feel Maryanne innately always knew what she needed to do to make peace with her life and her death. By numbing and over-medicating she was running away from herself and the means to tap that knowing. I knew I could help her get there if she would let me. I offered guided imagery when she had exhausted doing it her way \u2014 when she realized stoicism, \"just the facts,\" and \"more morphine, please\" were clearly not working for her. When she got it, and was ready, she invited me into her heart. She offered me her hand and I was able to use guided imagery to journey with her, to witness her soul empower her mind to break the chains of fear. It was an honor to have been a part of this precious woman's life. Mary DeLisle-Berry, R.N., has 30 years of experience in ICU, ER, Neuro-oncology, home care, and hospice nursing.

I have to pinch myself to make sure that it wasn't a dream. I spent five days in an intensive workshop for advanced dog trainers with Cesar Millan, \"The Dog Whisperer,\" the most famous dog trainer in the world, my idol. I have all of his shows and training DVD's. I subscribe to his magazine. I am a member of the \"Cesar's Way\" online community. For the past few years I have watched The Dog Whisperer reruns for two hours every evening. I know each of the episodes by heart but still learn something new with every show. Cesar does not describe himself as a dog trainer. He says, \"I rehabilitate dogs and I train people.\" He trains people \u2014 the dog owners \u2014 through his words and through his presence. He is centered. He brings a sense of calm and a deeply respectful presence to every encounter. There is never a hint of chastising, or mocking, or derision. The dog owners' children often become the \"stars\" of the dog owning family because Cesar finds in them a readiness to learn and to be present with the dog. Older people are addressed as \"Mr. Steve\" or \"Miss Kathy,\" reflecting Cesar's Mexican heritage of respect for elders. He is brought into situations with fearful, hopeless owners and aggressive or frightened dogs and leaves them all with quiet calm, confidence, and routines for living together in harmony. In seeing that, I have found my life's calling. Like every little girl who has had a dog, I loved my Napoleon. In retrospect, Napoleon was a not an easy dog to be around. He growled at dogs and people. We generally kept him in the laundry room with the linoleum floor so he wouldn't mess the house. My parents, like most dog owners, didn't have a clue as to how to raise a dog. But I loved Napoleon with all my heart. My next dog, or should I say dogs, came about 25 years later. That's when I started to collect dogs. First a German Shepherd we named Tristan after a character my husband and I loved from the TV show All Creatures Great and Small . Then a soft- coated Wheaten Terrier named Duigan (an Irish name because Wheatens come from Ireland). On Becoming a Dog Whisperer Cesar Millan, \"The Dog Whisperer\", Julia Levitt and Julia's dog, Tot Man Cesar does not describe himself as a dog trainer. He says, \"I rehabilitate dogs and I train people.\" Julia and Napoleon Continued on page 66He is brought into situations with fearful, hopeless owners and aggressive or frightened dogs and leaves them all with quiet calm, confidence, and r outines for living together in harmony. In seeing that, I have found my life's calling. \u2014 Julia Levitt on Cesar Millan, \"The Dog Whisperer\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 66 Then another Wheaten. Then a Portuguese Water Dog (like the Obama's have). After the Wheatens passed away, it was then a retired racing Greyhound. After the Greyhound and the \"Portie\" passed away, we \"downsized\" to smaller dogs \u2014 a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and two Pomeranians. I have loved them all. I took dog training classes with all of them and trained all of them, some to the very highest levels of obedience. But all of this had nothing to do with dog whispering. It had nothing to do with providing the dog with a calm, assertive presence \u2014 a presence that allows the dog to feel stable and reassured. That is something totally different. Cesar Millan and dog whispering had not yet arrived on the scene. In the meantime, I was learning about a different kind of whispering \u2014 horse whispering. While it is true that I loved my Napoleon, as a child I did not want to be a dog. I wanted to be a horse. My sister and I spent hours pretending to be horses. As adolescents we rode horses. And 30 years later I bought a horse and named her Punya, which means \"good karma\" in Sanskrit. I devoted most of my waking hours to learning about horse whispering. If you saw the recent movie Buck about Buck Brannaman, \"The Horse Whisperer,\" that's what I was learning, from instructors who had worked directly with Buck. Natural horsemanship is about relating to a horse in a horse-like manner and speaking their language rather than using abusive or coercive techniques to \"break\" a horse. It works. It is a delightful pleasure. It touched my heart.And one day five years ago it almost killed me. As will happen occasionally with any horse, my horse spooked and threw me. I had been thrown off a horse many times over the years but this time was different. This time I broke my back, had eight broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a separated shoulder. I was first taken to St. Joseph Mercy Saline Hospital, and then transferred to the Trauma Unit at St. Joe's in Ann Arbor. I wore a brace on my torso for six months. As soon as I had the okay from my doctor, I went back to riding \u2014 but it wasn't the same. Well into middle age, I shuddered at the potential impact of another accident. I decided to get out of horses. It left a big hole in my life. Just to fill the time and to keep busy during this transition, I joined up with a dog walking service. I love dogs and love to walk. What a perfect combination. Right around this time I was starting to watch The Dog Whisperer on TV. I tried some of his techniques on the dogs I was walking and they worked great! One of my first real successes was walking two Jack Russell Terriers. They were typical Jack Russells, feisty and in command, and a pain to walk. I tried Cesar's techniques of calm, assertive leadership, and, somewhat to my surprise, the Jack Russells responded just like on TV! In about five minutes, they were walking along like little gentlemen! Even the neighbors were pointing, and laughing, and amazed. \"Are those the same two dogs you started out with?\" Talk about fun! Because of all of my horse whispering and natural horsemanship experience, I was able to pick up the basics of dog whispering pretty quickly. And it worked like a charm. From there my path was clear. I became a dog trainer and a professional dog whisperer. In addition to training dogs and their owners, I started teaching dog training classes at Ann Arbor Animal Hospital and started to write a dog training blog for AnnArbor.com. I contacted Cesar Millan's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Cheri Lucas, and asked her to provide me with telephone coaching so I could continue to learn about dog whispering. This past January my husband and I planned a vacation to California so that I could spend a half-day learning from Cheri Lucas. Cheri was very pleased with what I had learned about dog whispering and encouraged me to attend the first workshop that Cesar ever planned for advanced dog trainers. That's how I met Cesar and became a true \"dog whisperer.\" I brought my Pomeranian, Tot Man, to the workshop. He was the only toy breed there, going on pack walks with the big dogs, and everyone loved Tot Man, including Cesar. It has been a long road. I am at the age when some are ending their careers, and I am just starting my career, my calling. My calling as a dog whisperer. Julia Levitt, \"Ann Arbor's Dog Whisperer,\" provides effective dog training for all breeds. In addition to private training and \"board and train,\" Julia also teaches classes at Ann Arbor Animal Hospital and writes articles for AnnArbor.com that help dog owners \"live in harmony\" with their dogs.

The deadline for submissions for the May through August issue is February 28, 2013. By Nieka Apell 826michigan On a recent evening, a dozen children aged 8 to 10 gathered for a creative writing workshop at 826michigan, located on Liberty Street in downtown Ann Arbor. Their mission? To solve the world's problems using \"An Almost Automatic Problem Solver!\" Facilitator Anna Prushinskaya challenged them to come up with an insurmountable problem. \"Bandits are taking over the world because they want our gold!\" suggested a boy. \"I'm excited to see where you are going to go with this one!\" replied Prushinskaya, adding, \"And now I'll give you one thing to help you solve the problem \u2014 a princess!\" The children laughed and then collaborated to come up with a creative \u2014 and logical \u2014 solution: the princess could cut off her long hair, weave it into rope, and use it to tie up the bandits! The workshop continued with more activities to help the children think about plot and character in their creative writing. A registered nonprofit organization founded in 2005, 826michigan is dedicated to helping students aged 6 to 18 develop their creative and expository writing skills and to helping teachers inspire their students to write. Workshops such as \"The Problem Solver,\" held many evenings at 826michigan, are aimed at \"helping kids feel that writing is not scary, it's not hard, and it can be a lot of fun,\" said 826michigan communications coordinator Amy Wilson, who majored in creative writing at the University of Michigan's Residential College. Wilson began volunteering for 826michigan in 2009 and joined the staff in 2011. \"I was the kid who carried around a notebook all the time, so I see myself in a lot of 826michigan's students,\" she said. Ann Arbor's 826michigan is part of a national umbrella organization founded by writer and editor Dave Eggers, perhaps best known for his memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius . While living in San Francisco's Mission District, Eggers felt that many children were underserved by the public school system, Wilson explained. At the same time, she added, he knew many writers and artists eager to share their time and talents with children. \"There were adults with time to give and kids who needed extra time for whatever reason,\" Wilson said. Eggers's idea grew into a San Francisco nonprofit, which opened its doors at 826 Valencia Street in 2002 with a mission of providing free, volunteer-driven, high-quality programs dedicated to youth writing. Wilson said it was called 826 Valencia \"Because they wanted a name that was just neutral \u2014 no name, no stigma, just a third place that wasn't home and wasn't school.\" Eggers and his cofounders soon discovered, however, that the 826 Valencia property was zoned as retail space. \"They wanted to provide a completely free service,\" said Wilson. \"They weren't thinking of selling anything.\" But they got an idea as they began renovating the space, which had been a weight-lifting gym. They discovered dark wood flooring that they thought looked like the \"hull of a pirate ship,\" Wilson said, explaining that Eggers then devised a plan to create a \"Pirate Supply Store\" \u2014 a one-stop shop for pirates, carrying unique items such as \"peg leg oil\" and \"parrot chow.\" That store now generates more than a quarter million dollars per year. A storefront is attached to each of the eight 826 branches across the country, including the Bigfoot Research Institute (Boston), the Museum of Unnatural History (Washington, DC) and, of course, the Liberty Street Robot Supply & Repair that is associated with 826michigan. That storefront opened in 2008, a year after 826michigan moved to its current location at 115 East Liberty. \"Our Robot Supply Store doesn't earn us a quarter million dollars,\" said Wilson, \"but it makes enough to pay for our rent and about half our utilities.\" Wilson added that 826michigan is fortunate to have a landlord who keeps rent as reasonable as possible. \"Because we want to be accessible to all, it's really important that we are located centrally and near public transportation, so being downtown is ideal,\" Wilson said. Wilson estimated that last year 826michigan served over 2,500 student writers. The students who come to the organization include enthusiastic elementary-school writers, like those attending the \"Problem-Solver\" workshop; teens involved in weekly writing groups; and homeschooled students who come to collaborate with others interested in writing. \"Our teen workshops are very popular,\" said Wilson. \"These are the kids who are 16 and working on their third novel. To be around kids with that kind of unfettered enthusiasm for writing is just so exciting and inspirational.\" Wilson said 826michigan's workshops are often dreamed up by the organization's volunteers. \"They bring their own ideas and expertise,\" she said. \"Anyone can come in with an idea and give it to Catherine [Calabro], our program manager. She can help them refine it into a workshop the volunteer can share with the kids.\" There are currently more than 2,000 names on 826michigan's volunteer list, with over 350 active volunteers. This pool of volunteer talent allows the organization to offer workshops with unique names and themes, such as \"Plays and Playwriting: Five-Minute Plays,\" \"Colonel Mustard in the Library with a Candlestick (How to Write a Mystery),\" and \"Story Problems: a Poetry and Prose Workshop for Young Adults.\" In addition, a very popular in-house workshop is the \"Super-Amazing College Entrance and Scholarship Essay Writing Workshop (With Pizza!)\" taught by Will Purves, a local educator who shares his experience in the college preparation process with local students. \"It can be very hard to find college essay preparation experience and ACT or SAT prep if you can't pay for it,\" said Wilson. \"We're so grateful to volunteers like Will for bringing his skills to us.\" The SAT/ACT preparation and essay workshops, like everything else 826michigan offers for students, are free of charge. Six paid staff members (three full-time and three part-time) manage volunteers and coordinate the programs, which often fill to capacity well in advance. One of the things that makes 826michigan unique among the eight 826 branches is that it's the only one not located in a large urban center. \"Because of that,\" said Wilson, \"we need to take a different approach to the 826 mission to serve all students, regardless of economics, cultural differences, differences in backgrounds.\" Wilson estimated that last year 826michigan served over 2,500 student writers. The students who come to the organization include enthusiastic elementary-school writers, like those attending the \"Problem-Solver\" workshop; teens involved in weekly writing groups; and homeschooled students who come to collaborate with others interested in writing. In addition to the workshops held in Ann Arbor, the organization offers a range of other programs, including an in-school residency program in classrooms in Ypsilanti. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 69 This means that only about 40 percent of 826michigan's activities take part at the Liberty Street storefront. These include structured evening workshops for kids aged 6 to 18 and drop-in workshops for poetry and fiction writing. In addition to the workshops held in Ann Arbor, the organization offers a range of other programs, including an in-school residency program in classrooms in Ypsilanti. In that program, volunteers work with students in 22 classrooms in six different public schools, for one to two hours per week. Tutoring programs at Ypsilanti Middle School pair students one-on-one with tutors. The in-school residency program is also expanding to work with Eastern Michigan University's Bright Futures program, a federally-funded initiative that provides opportunities such as yoga, gardening, and other experiences that enrich students' lives through mentorships with adults. Less-structured, drop-in writing groups held at the Ypsilanti District Library are extremely popular as well. The gift of a used vehicle from a local donor has made it much easier for 826michigan to expand its programs in Ypsilanti. Teachers of elementary-school students can also bring a whole classroom of students on a field trip to 826michigan's Liberty Street location for a morning of creative writing activities. One such program, for second and third graders, begins with the facilitator telling the children that it is Thursday and that they are there to make toast. The children, of course, know it's really Friday, and they believe they are there for a writing workshop. Wilson explained, \"This leads to a wild frenzy of events that they are a day late and that they need to hurry to get Friday's deadline of a story for Dr. Blotch done immediately.\" \"Dr. Blotch,\" said Wilson, \"is a volunteer Skyping from the basement of 826michigan. The kids don't always know that, though. Dr. Blotch doesn't like kids and thinks they can't write and that they smell like diapers. If there's anything that will get kids to write, it's someone telling them that they can't and that they smell!\" Publishing and performing student work is also a focus of 826michigan, and each year some of the participants get their work published. The organization prints two professionally bound books of student work each year as well as the 826michigan OMNIBUS , an annual student journal. It also publishes a collection of works from one of its in-school residencies. \"It's one thing to just say, 'I really like your poem,'\" Wilson said, adding, \"It's something else entirely to say, 'I really like your poem, and I'm going to put it into this beautiful book so that everyone can read it.' It makes kids think, 'I must be a great writer because I am a part of this great book!'\" Student playwrights also have the chance to see their work performed, thanks to 826michigan's partnership with The Penny Seats Theatre Company of Ann Arbor, which produces and stages an annual benefit show for 826michigan. This year's benefit, held in November, was called \"Five Bowls of Oatmeal,\" because each play mentions \"oatmeal\" somewhere. Other programs offered by 826michigan include an English Language Learners (ELL) workshop for children aged 8 to 18 that is lead by two experienced ELL teachers, and occasional adult writing workshops (some of which are fee-based and serve as fund raisers for the youth programs). Future plans include expanding many of 826michigan programs into Detroit classrooms.

Our goal is to help them manage their pain and their fears through the use of breathing, visualization, and meditation techniques \u2014 all part of martial arts.\" Goldberg, who is a spiritual leader, a black belt in the Korean art of Choi Kwon Do, and a father who lost his first child to cancer in 1983, has a unique perspective on children who are confronting pain and illness. Seven years after daughter Sara Basya died from the effects of ALL (acute lymphocytic leukemia), the family moved to Michigan, where Goldberg became the Rabbi of Young Israel of Southfield. One day, Rabbi Simcha Scholar approached Goldberg to talk about a special camp he was involved with \u2014 one of the very first pediatric oncology camps in the nation. Goldberg thought the idea of such a camp was wonderful and offered to donate money to the cause. Rabbi Scholar, however, had not come seeking a donation; instead, he wanted Goldberg to direct the camp. Goldberg was concerned that it would be upsetting for him and his wife to see children suffering as their daughter had. Still, they agreed to direct Camp Simcha in New York State, and did so for twelve years.It was at Camp Simcha, watching children undergo painful and frightening medical procedures related to their cancer treatment, that Goldberg noticed something significant. He realized that when an adult experiences pain during a medical procedure, medical professionals often stop the procedure to offer some kind of pain relief or to try a different strategy, but that when a child cries out from pain, medical professionals often hold the child down more tightly and continue. As he watched a young boy in distress, Goldberg had an idea: that his own training in the martial arts might help the child. Using Tai Chi breathing exercises, he taught the boy how to manage his pain and fear. \"We used to believe that there was just a 'pain center' in the brain,\" explained Goldberg. \"Now we understand that there is a much more complex neuro-matrix of pain receptors. Our goal at Kids Kicking Cancer is to help these children take control. Giving people purpose when they're going through pain can be profoundly effective in reducing their pain, especially for children.\" Goldberg now lectures on these topics in his role as clinical assistant professor in pediatrics at the Wayne State University School of Medicine and continues as the Kids Kicking Cancer national director. Kids Kicking Cancer began at the Children's Hospital of Michigan in 1999; the organization now has programs internationally. Its Ann Arbor program began three years ago, with weekly martial arts classes held at the Cancer Support Community - Greater Ann Arbor (formerly The Wellness Community of Southeast Michigan). Goldberg said that children as young as three years of age meet for weekly martial arts classes, where they find a natural ability to focus. \"A child who is prone to normally want to run around and go wild can sit and focus and practice meditation and imagery,\" he said. Instructors have mastery in the martial arts and also receive \"It's one thing to just say, 'I really like your poem... It's something else entirely to say, 'I really like your poem, and I'm going to put it into this beautiful book so that everyone can read it.' It makes kids think, 'I must be a great writer because I am a part of this great book!'\" \u2014 Amy Wilson\"When we ask kids about their pain, we found 88.1 percent of our interventions with children significantly lowered their pain.\" \u2014 Rabbi Elimelech Goldberg Continued on page 70 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 70 additional education in topics related to children and their families confronting cancer. Because they have an understanding of the martial arts and of the children's medical issues, explained Goldberg, they can support kids at various stages in their treatment process, including times when they may be in pain, unable to stand, or using a wheelchair, for example. In addition, instructors sometimes accompany their students to medical procedures to help them use the pain-relieving techniques they have learned in class. Children who have participated in Kids Kicking Cancer may also go on to become instructors. \"One of our assistant instructors was part of the very first Kids Kicking Cancer class and is now teaching for Kids Kicking Cancer,\" said Goldberg. The young man had undergone ribcage surgery years ago as part of his treatment for an especially aggressive type of cancer. \"His mother had asked doctors if he'd have to have more surgeries as he grew, and the doctors told his mother, basically, 'No,' meaning that he would not live long enough to need that,\" explained Goldberg. \"Now, he's recently had that surgery and is an assistant instructor in the program.\" Kids Kicking Cancer programs are offered free of charge to children who have themselves been diagnosed with cancer or who have a parent or other family member with cancer. Currently, 23 to 25 children participate in the Ann Arbor program. Goldberg said that many of the exercises kids learn help them to manage the inevitable pain associated with cancer treatments. \"When we ask kids about their pain, we found 88.1 percent of our interventions with children significantly lowered their pain,\" he said. \"One of the reasons this program is so successful is that kids believe in the martial arts,\" he added. \"They believe in it, and that helps techniques and interventions work.\" The skills and techniques the children learn include visualization, focus, and breathing exercises. \"A big part of martial arts is imagery and visualization,\" explained Goldberg. \"You have to see the board you are breaking and visualize yourself breaking it. Many of our kids can't break boards because of brittle bones or issues related to treatment, but they can hit pads and visualize that the pad they are going to hit is their cancer. This power and this focus makes kids feel very empowered.\" Another powerful technique that is useful for everyone, he says \u2014 whether one is fighting a battle with cancer or just facing everyday life stress \u2014 is the \"Breath Brake.\" Goldberg explained that breathing is the only part of the autonomic nervous system that one can control easily. The Breath Brake \u2014 related to the idea of slowing down one's breathing, like using the brakes on a car \u2014 uses a Tai Chi technique to relax all the muscles that tighten during times of stress. \"This tightness leads to an increased respiration rate, increased pain, and our immune system starts to shut down when we are stressed,\" said Goldberg. \"It's why we get sick when we get stressed. We teach the children how to use their breath to relax their muscles when they exhale. They breathe in energy and light and then blow out the darkness. This gives them a sense of control and moves them away from a fight-or-flight response, to calmness and empowerment.\" Twelve-year-old Desi said she found the breathing techniques to be very helpful to her. \"Power breathing helps you push out the pain and anger, and let in the good,\" she explained. Goldberg said the kids come back to class and tell the instructors that they have taught breathing techniques to their parents as well.Fortunately, said Goldberg, most of the Kids Kicking Cancer participants do heal and survive their cancer. \"Thankfully, most of these kids do great \u2014 I'd say there's an 80 to 90 percent cure rate,\" said Goldberg. \"But, even if they don't do great, we help them to be victors rather than victims.\" If the Kids Kicking Cancer instructors know that a child is not doing well, they make sure the child receives his or her black belt before passing away. \"We embroider the child's name on one side of the belt and 'Master Teacher' on the other side, because that is what they are. They are all teachers. Sometimes they receive their belt in front of hundreds of family and friends and sometimes in a quiet hospital room.\" The idea that all children fighting cancer are teachers is an important part of the philosophy of Kids Kicking Cancer. \"It's our mantra,\" explained Goldberg. \"Power, peace, and purpose. Power for inner light. Peace used to calm and heal. Purpose to teach the world.\" During the weekly martial arts sessions for children, Kids Kicking Cancer also offers services to parents, including support groups, instruction in helping reduce children's pain, counseling, and special events. \"We become part of these kids' families,\" said Goldberg. Goldberg said that Kids Kicking Cancer is a registered nonprofit organization that received some government support until 2009. \"Now we get by with praying, and we're always working to get funding from individual and corporate donors,\" he said. The organization is also seeking volunteers with experience in the martial arts who may be interested in learning to become instructors.

The problem? He needed an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter; however, budgeting changes had eliminated funds for that accommodation. The parents sought solutions on their own. One option was for Lage or Mahoney, both fluent in ASL, to interpret for their son. \"I tried to interpret during a school lunch period when Jacob's regular school interpreter was not available,\" said Lage. \"We parents all know how differently our kids behave for their parents versus how they behave for other adults. Plus, I found myself being his mom rather than his interpreter. With us [parents] there with him, we can't be neutral, and he can't be his own person in that situation.\" This problem led to a brainstorming session with Rec & Ed. \"We thought there might be an interest for others to learn to sign,\" said Lage. Although Jacob's parents are not teachers themselves, they decided to try offering a beginning ASL class through Rec \"We teach the children how to use their breath to relax their muscles when they exhale. They breathe in energy and light and then blow out the darkness. This gives them a sense of control and moves them away from a fight-or- flight response, to calmness and empowerment.\" \u2014 Rabbi Elimelech Goldberg Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from page 69 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 71 & Ed for children from kindergarten through grade 5. \"We came to the agreement that, in lieu of paying us directly, we could use those funds to pay for an interpreter so that Jacob could participate in soccer without one of us having to be on the field with him,\" explained Lage. Approximately 20 elementary school children are currently enrolled in Lage and Mahoney's ASL class, which is held after school weekly at Bach Elementary School. \"What started as an accommodation for Jacob has grown into this class,\" said Lage. During a recent class session, kids learned signs for favorite foods. \"How do I say \"There's a lot of myth-busting we can do here. It's a great time and place to ask questions.\" \u2014 Marian Lage Continued on page 72 \"My father wanted to be an architect or engineer, but without accommodations, that did not happen. He still regrets not achieving his goals. We want Jacob and Justin to have access to whatever their hearts desire, and it's great if we can give others exposure to and understanding of sign language and deaf culture, too.\" \u2014 Marian Lag e The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 72 bacon?\" asked one student. Lage demonstrated the sign, which uses two fingers on each hand, to show the shape of a piece of bacon. Students have also learned how to sign colors, animals, seasons, and their names. Now, after several weeks into the session, the students are starting to put together simple sentences. \"The ones who have a strong interest in signing may be able to have some conversations with Jacob soon,\" said Lage. \"Having a group of students with some interest in and understanding of ASL is a good thing, and kids certainly don't need to be afraid to use whatever signs they know. They can just use those signs within context, use any other props, gestures, facial expressions, and they can get a lot of information across to a deaf person like Jacob.\" Lage said that, in addition to learning to interact with Jacob in his language, the Bach students enrolled in the class are asking very important questions. \"There's a lot of myth-busting we can do here. It's a great time and place to ask questions,\" said Lage. For example, in a recent meeting of the class, one student asked how Jacob had learned to sign, and he seemed surprised to hear that he had learned it gradually, from the time he was a baby, just like the other students had learned to speak in English. Another child asked what one could do if one wanted a deaf person to stop doing something. Lage just smiled and said, \"Do what you'd do for anyone else: ask them to stop.\" Lage said that building community awareness is also an important part of the ASL classes. \"We want the students to realize that deaf people have a culture and a pride of their own,\" she said. \"We don't focus on the ear or on hearing or not hearing; we focus on Jacob, and if others can interact with him, it's great for everyone.\" Other myths that Lage says the class works to debunk include the idea that ASL is an \"easy\" language to learn and that it's universal. Lage explained that ASL is not even universal within the United States, as there are many regionalisms and colloquialisms used in different parts of the country. Students in the class are also learning how ASL changes over time. \"It's a living, evolving language, and signs are constantly being added and changing,\" explained Lage. She gave as an example the sign for \"telephone,\" which used to resemble an old candlestick-style telephone, with one hand near the mouth and another near the ear. As telephones changed, the sign did, too, she said, evolving to look more like a hand holding an extended, one-piece device. The current sign is made by a hand held in a C-shape, as if holding a small cellular phone. \"It's a great opportunity to teach students \u2014 and some teachers and parents \u2014 about sign language and about deaf culture in general,\" Lage said. Lage also noted that ASL is not \"easy\" to learn, although it might initially seem fairly simple to learn individual signs. The language has a unique syntax and, more challenging to nonnative ASL users, a grammar that \"lies in the eyebrows and lips \u2014 \"nonmanual markers,\" Lage explained. \"To ask a question or to make a statement depends entirely on one's face,\" she said. For this reason, skilled interpreters, such as Lydia Callis, who recently received a great deal of media attention for her emotive interpretation of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's speech on Hurricane Sandy, must use their faces in time with their hand signs in order for their translations to make sense. Lage said some people do not realize that ASL interpreters must be \"theatrical\" in order to clearly communicate meaning. Even with skilled interpreters in Jacob's classrooms, Lage said her son still \"misses out\" on a lot of incidental learning and side conversations. \"There are no interpreters for incidental learning,\" she explained. \"The conversations students have with one another, the off-handed comments between the teacher and other students, those side conversations that stop as soon as the interpreter or any other adult person comes near...those are the things that will become even more important to him as he gets older. Who knows, maybe he'll find some peers with an interest in signing that can fill him in on everything else going on in the classroom!\" Parents of some of the students enrolled in the class have found that their children are using ASL to communicate with one another. Wendy Valtadoros, mother of Lydia and Melanie, said she has seen her daughters use ASL to communicate with each other at home. Lage hopes that an introduction to ASL may also have long-range benefits for some of her students. She explained that ASL is now being treated equally to other world languages taught in Michigan schools. Until there are certified teachers of ASL, however, the language will not be taught in K-12 classrooms, Lage said, adding that once there are K-12 teachers with an ASL endorsement, Michigan students may have the chance to take ASL to fulfill graduation requirements. Of note is that Madonna University in Livonia has been accredited to offer an ASL teaching endorsement through its new ASL for Education program; information at the university's website indicates that it is one of the only programs of its kind in the nation (for more information, see http://herald.madonna.edu/Madonna_Herald/ASL.html). \"There's a shortage of qualified interpreters, so training more is always a good thing,\" Lage said. She added that ASL may also offer a unique language-learning opportunity for children with more kinesthetic and visual learning styles. \"I hope that our class piques kids' interests to think about sign language when they're choosing a world language,\" she said. Plans for Lage and Mahoney to offer more advanced ASL classes through Ann Arbor Rec & Ed are being discussed; however, Lage said she is not sure how best to grow the program, since she and Mahoney both work full time. Right now, however, they \"are just really pleased with everybody's interest in this program,\" Lage said. \"We hope that this class benefits everyone, Jacob and Justin [Jacob's two-year-old brother who is also deaf], and all the students \u2014 and the teachers and other family members \u2014 involved.\" Lage, whose parents are also deaf, said that her family holds a \"nonpathological view of deafness\" and that she hopes exposure to ASL and deaf culture will help others feel similarly. \"My father wanted to be an architect or engineer, but without accommodations, that did not happen. He still regrets not achieving his goals. We want Jacob and Justin to have access to whatever their hearts desire, and it's great if we can give others exposure to and understanding of sign language and deaf culture, too.\" Families interested in learning more about Lage and Mahoney's ASL classes should consult Ann Arbor Community Education and Recreation at http://www.aareced.com/ or call (734) 994-2300. Marian Lage welcomes questions at lage.marian@gmail.com. Girls Group For many Ann Arbor-area teenage girls, completing high school and going on to receive a college education is an expectation. Others, however \u2014 even bright young women with great potential \u2014 may not know anyone who has gone on to college and may have a hard time envisioning it as a possibility for themselves. A local nonprofit called Girls Group has a goal of identifying \"young women with the potential to be first-generation college students,\" according to the organization's executive director, Sue Schooner. She said that an important part of the Girls Group mission is to guide young women on a path to becoming \"emotionally and economically self-sufficient.\" The organization does this through a wide range of programs, workshops, and mentorships. A former Chrysler executive, Schooner was volunteering for The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan when she became acquainted with a group of girls who lived in the Pinelake Village Cooperative in Ann Arbor. As she spent more time with these girls, Schooner realized their potential for success in higher education, despite the life challenges they faced. At age 47, Schooner chose to retire from her employment Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from page 71 The success enjoyed by Girls Group members is noteworthy: the group has a 100 percent high- school graduation rate, and 37 of its members are currently enrolled at colleges and universities. \"When I come to Girls Group, I don't feel invisible anymore.\" \u2014 A Girls Group memberThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 73 in the auto industry, and in 2003 she founded Girls Group. She initially funded the organization herself, but nine years ago she took the steps needed for it to become a registered nonprofit. Girls Group now operates on private donations and on grants from organizations such as the Knights of Columbus, Mardi Gras Foundation, MGM, Kiwanis, and many others, and on donations of meeting space from local organizations such as Peace Neighborhood Center, Hikone Community Center, and the University of Michigan. \"We have incredibly low overhead for an organization like ours since we have no building of our own,\" Schooner said, \"We rely on the generosity of others.\" Girls Group works with teachers, counselors, and other nonprofits to identify middle- and high-school girls in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti who have a desire to complete high school and go on to college. Schooner said that this year there are 15 middle-school and 40 high-school students involved with Girls Group. And the success enjoyed by Girls Group members is noteworthy: the group has a 100 percent high-school graduation rate, and 37 of its members are currently enrolled at colleges and universities including Michigan State, Wayne State, Ferris State, Eastern Michigan University, Washtenaw Community College, DePaul University (Chicago), and Tuskegee University (Tuskegee, Alabama). The achievements of Girls Group participants can be attributed to the depth and variety of experiences the organization offers, all aimed at developing \"confident young women who know that they have a voice, an opinion, and know how to use these to succeed in college and in the workplace,\" said Schooner. Participants gather weekly for discussion groups on a wide range of topics including careers, politics, HIV/AIDS, relationships with parents and significant others, and other issues in their lives. \"'When I come to Girls Group, I don't feel invisible anymore,'\" Schooner quoted one participant as saying. \"Most Girls Group participants have backgrounds which include one or more traumas \u2014 homelessness, poverty, abuse, rape, and/or neglect,\" Schooner noted. Because Girls Group is not affiliated with any particular religion, participants are able to talk about a wide range of issues, Schooner said. \"Our goal is to help these girls to develop open minds,\" she said. \"Our girls are mostly Christian or Muslim, but we have people come talk with them about being Jewish, about being Muslim, about being American Indian, about being gay. We want to create an open-minded group. These young women want to be treated that way, and to achieve that, we all need to keep it real and we all need to be open-minded,\" Schooner said. Another important aim of the Girls Group program is teaching anger management strategies to participants. \"They are often angry because they are disenfranchised,\" Schooner said. \"These girls really do have a lot of stress and frustration in their lives. They are so close to being angry, and then when something happens at home or at school, that anger accelerates and they just want to explode. We want to teach them how to cut that anger before it gets in the way of doing what they need to do to be successful,\" explained Schooner. To help the girls learn to manage their emotions, Schooner brings in volunteers to teach them a variety of strategies for relaxation, anger management, and stress relief, including yoga, healthy eating, meditation, and Zumba. \"Some girls may find that yoga's not their thing, but others may like it for stress relief,\" she said. \"Someone else may love art journaling or jogging. We try to teach them as many ways to self-soothe as we can by giving them a whole variety of tools. This is a skill that will get them through school, through college, through work, and through relationships. They need to find their own coping mechanisms.\" When life situations become too intense, each Girls Group member knows she can reach out to Schooner or to the other counselors who work with the group. Schooner said there are currently three paid staff members and four social work interns (there will be six beginning in January) who are available to talk with the girls or their mothers at any time. \"Every girl and every mom has a cell phone number for me and for our counselors,\" said Schooner. \"They know they can call us at any time for any reason \u2014 a family problem, a boy problem, a school problem. They can always call a mentor and say they need help.\" In addition to having a mentor available in times of crisis, forming ongoing, meaningful relationships with successful adult mentors is an important part of Girls Group. \"We want the girls to learn how to trust adults,\" Schooner said. \"They might work back and forth writing journals to each other or find other activities they both enjoy. This makes every girl feel special, to communicate this way with a mentor.\" Girls Group has a three-year relationship with the Junior League of Ann Arbor, and the girls continue to benefit from mentoring opportunities with the group. \"At first, girls felt like those women were just so different from themselves,\" said Schooner. \"These people come in to talk to you and they look so different than you do and talk different from you, and you feel you have nothing in common. Then there are people who might look like you, but who are college graduates and are so successful. After a while, though, they connect at a heart level and realize that they aren't entirely different, and that is life-changing.\" Other activities are aimed at developing what Schooner calls \"social capital\" among the girls. Schooner told of a story she'd read recently in an autobiographical book about a young man who was asked to go into a grocery store to buy brie cheese and other foods with which he was unfamiliar. \"He felt really stupid and angry,\" said Schooner. \"That kind of situation happens to these girls all the time, and it's easy to get really, really angry. We try to put them in those situations so they are not uncomfortable when they encounter something new, and we help them think of ways to self-soothe when they do get angry.\" Girls Group staff and volunteers offer the girls \"etiquette brunches\" and take them to museums, concerts, plays, conferences, and events at upscale homes to have mix-and-mingle sessions at which they can talk to other kids and adults they may not know and with whom they may not have a lot in common. \"This helps prepare them for reality,\" explained Schooner. \"That's what life in college and the workplace is going to be like.\" Many of the Girls Group programs are focused more specifically on helping the girls graduate from high school, evaluate higher education options, and begin college. Homework help is offered every Tuesday evening, and Girls Group staff and volunteers help the girls get to ACT preparation courses, college tours, and college preparation summer camps at schools across the country by finding funding for transportation or actually taking the girls themselves. \"It can be so empowering being on a plane,\" said Schooner. \"You're so used to focusing on all the drama in your little neighborhood or in your school or in your family, and then you're in a plane with all these strangers, and many of them look different than you do, and then you're on a college campus, and staying in a dorm \u2014 again, with people with very different experiences from you. The girls see all of that, and it's very motivating and empowering.\" Schooner is proud that every one of the Girls Group participants who has graduated from high school has gone on to college. \"We emphasize that while everyone goes on to college, there are a lot of valid options available. It's not just about going to a four-year school. We are much more intentional about it,\" explained Schooner, adding that Girls Group mentors help the girls make matrices for evaluating college programs, dorms, and costs. \"All this helps the girls feel as if they are making a good choice,\" she said. \"There are a variety of great programs. The goal is to be economically and emotionally self-sufficient. We help them look at ways to do that other than a four-year degree, if that's the best choice for them right now.\" Schooner added that the relationship that Girls Group has developed at Washtenaw Community College and with WCC President Rose Bellanca has made that school an especially attractive option. \"She is so charming and so welcoming. She recently spent two hours with our girls answering their questions and talking with them about their goals and dreams.\" Schooner encourages anyone who knows a girl who might benefit from Girls Group to get in touch with her. She said that some people can't believe she can have girls from six different high schools \u2014 or from six different neighborhoods \u2014 getting along in a group together. \"The group initially did exhibit some prejudices,\" said Schooner, \"but now we've done so much work together \u2014 things like 'Trust Days,' when we do exercises that connect the girls at a different level. Now these girls are connected at the heart level. Now they are comfortable mixing no matter where they go to school, and they can carry that forward as they go on to college and to work and to all their other relationships in their lives.\" For more information about Girls Group, contact: Sue Schooner, executive director, sue@girlsgroup.org; 2445 Newport Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48103; (734) 994-6627; www.girlsgroup.org b Stephaney Moses, accepting the Hometown Health Hero Award, on behalf of Girls Group, at the State Capitol in Lansing, for Public Health Week.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 74 By Rachel Urist I arrive at Jeannine Palms's home on a Tuesday morning to find her outside, pushing a wheelbarrow. Two pre-schoolers trail behind her. Two others rush to greet me. \"Are you from Crazy Wisdom?\" one asks. Jeannine looks up and greets me by name. The children echo the greeting. I am pleasantly surprised. I hadn't expected such greetings. This is Blossom Home Pre-School & Adventures, now 25 years old. Once the children move on from pre-school, they can enroll in one of Jeannine's after-school \"Blossom Adventure\" sessions, and the friendships forged at Blossom continue. Older kids, 6-10 years old, come two days a week, from 4:00-5:30 pm. Adventures take place in or around the home, with many activities in the 39-acre expanse of Buhr Park, which is an extension of Jeannine's back yard. Jeannine and the children can walk to the park's Cobblestone Farm, the newly initiated Food Forest, any of the three Children's Wet Meadow Project meadows, the sledding hill, climbing trees fondly known as the Porcupine Trees, or Ice Mountain, the piles of icy scrapings from the ice rink. All these sites are visible from Jeannine's back yard, whose most salient feature is a sturdy, rustic, wide swing. It seats five children. Jeannine's friend, an urban forester, made the swing, and it hangs from a climbing tree, which also holds a knotted rope for scaling. When Jeannine pushes the pre-school children on the swing, it begins to twirl. I joke with the kids that it's dizzying. \"Dizzy is good,\" Jeannine says. \"It stimulates the brain. That's true in children, till about age ten.\" Later in the day, when a Blossom Adventure child follows her friend up the tree but can't get down, Jeannine calmly shows her another way. \"Try turning, so you're facing the tree.\" The child tries several times to turn. She finally succeeds. \"Good! Now, hold the rope, and find your footing. It's an easy drop to the ground. I'll spot you.\" The child descends without a hitch. \"Do you have your diggers?\" Jeannine asks the pre-school children. I wonder what \"diggers\" are. Then I see. From a bucket, each child selects a weeding tool and holds it, pointed side down, as they've been taught. The children are off to Ian's house, three doors down, where they will need diggers to remove weeds from Ian's garden. As we head for Ian's, I ask Jeannine about the profusion of plants in her garden. \"That's trillium, wild geranium, celadine poppy, scouring rush \u2014 a form of horsetail, Save the Earth, Tend the Children ~ A Visit with Naturalist Jeannine Palms, Owner of Blossom Home Pre-School & Adventures Jeannine Palms Care for each other and the earth is the central focus of Jeannine's Blossom Home activities... Her mission is two-pronged: save the earth, tend the children. She would probably laugh at that grandiose tenor, but she is deeply committed to both pedagogy and the environment. Her philosophy of teaching may best be summed up as: provide the stimuli for learning; use nature to excite imagination; and teach children to be caring, curious, and involved members of the community. When Jeannine pushes the pre-school children on the swing, it begins to twirl. I joke with the kids that it's dizzying. \"Dizzy is good,\" Jeannine says. \"It stimulates the brain. That's true in children, till about age ten.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 75 mayapple, and sorel.\" There are almost 100 different plant species in the garden: ferns, native perennials, herbs, peonies, strawberries, vegetables, phlox, flowering trees, and fruit trees. The list is long and the time short; children's questions come first. They ask about the neighbors' plants en route to Ian's back yard, where a 4 x 6-foot garden plot awaits. Ian's yard, like Jeannine's, adjoins the park. The garden plot is covered with hay, to which Jeannine will add the wheelbarrow's stash of \"nice rotting hay,\" a good mulch. Jeannine is 65 and slim, with ash blond hair that falls below her shoulders. If she has grey hair, it is well camouflaged. Hairclips behind each ear create a pig-tails look. She wears a floppy-brimmed gardening hat and, like the children, she is in rain boots, rain pants, and a hooded jacket. Her hat is courtesy of the City of Ann Arbor's Natural Area Preservation Commission. She is an official steward for Buhr Park. Ian smiles broadly when the kids arrive. He knows these kids, and the older ones, too. A certified special education teacher, he subs frequently at Allen School. The kids dig in, weeding unwanted greens. I am surprised to learn that lily of the valley is an invasive species that crowds out the native ones. The adults take turns with Ian's spade, digging to create an \"edge\" to help prevent invading weeds. \"Look! There's a big earthworm,\" shouts one of the kids. \"There are lots of them! And look at all the roly polys! There's a big spider!\" Everyone stops to examine the creatures. A child proudly pulls up a big dandelion plant, roots attached, and Jeannine points out that the hole that's left is a good place for rainwater to seep, to help other plants grow. Then Ian shows Jeannine a vine creeping along the garden plot. \"Can I just pull it out?\" he asks her. Jeannine looks. \"This is creeping Charlie. Yes, let's pull it.\"Ian tells me that this garden will have basil, tomatoes, peppers, and calendula. The kids, tired of weeding, have begun to run up and down the grassy hill of Ian's back yard. While they play, Jeannine explains that calendula is a flower that attracts bees and other pollinators. It is edible and medicinal.Later she explains that the \"edge\" they created by digging a narrow trench around the garden plot eliminates the need to weed much in the future. Leaving soil undisturbed, allowing organisms to develop and weed seeds to germinate, prevents the release of carbon to the atmosphere. Where soil is exposed, carbon is released.The kids are thirsty and hungry. Jeannine has them all wash up - outside. Since there is no hose handy, a water bottle, stashed in her purple backpack, becomes a faucet. Jeannine squirts frugally. They wash over a sapling, so that the tree benefits from the water, too. \"I have all this nice loam in my fingernails. Do you have some, too?\" she asks the kids as they wash. At home, too, she washes in water-saving ways. When she cleans her dishes, she sets two small bins of water side by side. One is soapy, one clear; no need for running water. Recently, she had an energy-efficient, metal roof installed on her house. It reflects heat away from the rooms beneath, keeping it surprisingly cool on hot days. Her transportation, too, puts the environment first. Jeannine walks or bikes whenever possible. Where distance requires a motor, she takes the bus. Jeannine and the children sit on the grass for their snack: water and homemade whole-wheat crackers. I say to Jeannine: \"You probably don't own a pair of gardening gloves.\" \"Oh, I have some in my pocket,\" she says. \"But soil has endorphins, so some people avoid gloves. The endorphins are why some people like gardening so much.\"Jeannine Palms's Favorite Initiatives 350 is the global, grassroots movement to reduce the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Scientists are convinced that the safe upper limit for carbon dioxide is 350 parts per million (PPM) in our atmosphere. Right now we're at 390 PPM. Jeannine, like many of the scientists studying climate change, is hopeful that we can save the planet\u2014IF we get back down to 350. New treaties and policy changes are needed to ensure this correction. Go to 350.org to learn more\u2014and to see some wonderful photo albums. 10/10/10 , a global work party, was a project of 350.org. It was a day of practical, positive action. Thousands of events, big and small, took place on that day around the world. Each event was designed to reduce carbon emissions. Says Jeannine: \" It truly was 'A Day to Celebrate Climate Solutions'; together we got to work in our communities on projects that can cut carbon and build the clean energy future.\" The name, 10/10/10, is a nod to its launch date: October 10, 2010. 171 participating countries are now on 10/10/10's roster. Ian's garden was sown that day as a 10/10/10 project. (Visit www.350.org/en/node/16834 to learn more.) The Buhr Park Children's Wet Meadow Project created and supports a group of wet meadow ecosystems in Ann Arbor's Buhr Park. The wet meadows provide a habitat for native plants and animals, an attractive educational site for children, neighbors, and other visitors, and an environmental filter for storm water runoff from the park grounds. The original Children's Wet Meadow is behind Cobblestone Farm. The second, a three-basin meadow, is on the west side, uphill from the playground. There are frequent events at the wet meadows, including an annual prescribed burn and presentations by naturalists who teach the children about the value of wetlands. Programs have focused on insects, pollinators, and wildflowers. See www.wetmeadow.org. The Food Forest, in Buhr Park, is a stone's throw from Allen School. The idea was born several years ago, part of an effort to help create local food security. Jeannine, along with friends and neighbors, continue to meet, plan, and create this garden, which is an extension of the third wet meadow. Last spring, the Allen School Pride Team wrote and received a grant to fund some of the fruit trees for the project. Under Jeannine's guidance, the team of students, parents and teachers, neighbors, and friends have planted 15 fruit trees. The garden will yield apples, pears, peaches, cherries, plums, apricots, chestnuts, and pawpaws. Natural Area Preservation (NAP) is a commission mandated to protect and restore Ann Arbor's natural areas, and to foster an environmental ethic in the community. NAP staff and volunteers conduct a wide range of ecological stewardship activities to restore the native plant and animal communities throughout the Ann Arbor Parks system's 1200 acres of natural areas. The Resilience Circle is part of a nationwide movement of small groups, usually 10-20 people in each, who help one another through challenging times. Jeannine's Resilience Circle is neighborhood based. Help spans a wide continuum, from sharing yard equipment, to sewing, cooking, consulting, providing employment counseling, financial assistance, and child care or pet-sitting. Each group has a facilitator, who helps the group learn about the causes of the economic downswing, the threats of climate change, and then to identify and address local needs. When a child has trouble with a task, she suggests that the other children help. In this way, the children own their activities at school. They are not corralled or regimented; they are making things happen. Later [Jeannine] explains that the \"edge\" they created by digging a narrow trench around the garden plot eliminates the need to weed much in the future. Leaving soil undisturbed, allowing organisms to develop and weed seeds to germinate, prevents the release of carbon to the atmosphere. Where soil is exposed, carbon is released. Continued on page 76 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 76 Jeannine has been teaching for 40 years, first in Detroit, now at her Ann Arbor home. She and her partner, Dale Petty, moved from Detroit 22 years ago. She was raised in Oakland County, before it became so suburban. Her family had 100 acres, and a grandmother lived down the lane. The homestead provided space for growing vegetables organically and raising chickens. They had a horse, too. Jeannine, along with her eight younger siblings and sundry cousins, learned to husband the earth long before \"environmentalism\" was coined. Jeannine's mother would take the children on nature walks, through fields and wetlands. Family vacations were rustic: camping in parks and wilderness areas throughout Michigan every summer. Her parents were avid conservationists. Care for each other and the earth is the central focus of Jeannine's Blossom Home activities. The children can already distinguish certain native from non-native plant species, and they can name many. Some of the children have helped Jeannine and others plant fruit trees in the newly forming Food Forest, a project that she helps coordinate with other community members, including students from Allen Elementary. Along with the Blossom pre-schoolers, she was also an initiator of the Buhr Park Children's Wet Meadow project. When the first wet meadow was extended, Yousef Rabhi, a Blossom Home alumnus and now a county commissioner, served as project manager. Back at Blossom, as the kids fondly call their pre-school, the kids remove their outerwear and stow everything in designated areas: hooks, cubbies, and floor space. They launch themselves into activity while Jeannine starts lunch, made of locally, organically grown grains, beans, lentils, tofu, fruits, and vegetables. One child takes out crayons and paper and begins to color. Another, whose raingear hid a frilly pink \"princess dress,\" as she calls it, begins to dance. The other two climb onto sawhorse-type structures with dowel-rungs on the sides for climbing and a cardboard horse-head with a mane of yarn affixed to the front end. The kids race across the prairie, which is what the playroom has become. Suddenly, a child shouts: \"Everybody be quiet! The baby is waking up!\" He refers to a doll that he has just covered with a blanket. The dancer, still twirling, proclaims: \"I am doing a performance!\" The two equestrians, who have been waving a single ribbon, begin to tussle. Jeannine, who has monitored everything from the kitchen, emerges, observes, and calmly asks: \"Can you solve this yourselves?\" They try. The dispute deepens. \"Would you like help solving this?\" she asks. A child becomes teary. Jeannine asks for the disputed ribbon. (\"May I hold this while we solve the problem?\") The child hands it over. \"You wanted it so much, you forgot to think; you forgot to listen,\" Jeannine says. \"Horses are like people; they like to be treated gently.\" She lets this sink in. Then: \"Let's start over. May I give you a suggestion? How about I set the timer, and each of you gets to have the ribbon for the same amount of time?\" This feels just. The problem is solved.This is one of many examples of how Jeannine promotes self-sufficiency and compassion. When a child cries, Jeannine calls attention to the tears, as if to drive home the consequences of inattention \u2014 or, worse, aggression. When a child has trouble with a task, she suggests that the other children help. In this way, the children own their activities at school. They are not corralled or regimented; they are making things happen. Jeannine is a no-nonsense person, but she is not brusque. She simply has no time to waste. Her calendar is full. Her mission is two-pronged: save the earth, tend the children. She would probably laugh at that grandiose tenor, but she is deeply committed to both pedagogy and the environment. Her philosophy of teaching may best be summed up as: provide the stimuli for learning; use nature to excite imagination; and teach them to be caring, curious, and involved members of the community. In Jeannine's cheerfully filled living room, which serves as an indoor play-space, a table holds jars of grain, seeds, and corn, which are used - as the children tell me - for making biscuits, bread, and cornbread. They grind the grains themselves. Recycling is a given. When Jeannine cuts apple sections for the children's snacks, they are aware that the parings she saves will become compost. Any bag she uses will be re-used. In doing projects with children, Jeannine instructs them in age-appropriate ways. No one is patronized, indulged, or commandeered. Children are gently encouraged. Invariably, they see the value of cooperation. The message is clear: Be considerate to each other and to the planet. I visit the school a few times. During my visits, she mentions several initiatives: 350, 10/10/10, the Food Forest, the Buhr Park Children's Wet Meadow Project, Natural Area Preservation (NAP), and the Resilience Circle. Jeannine is deeply involved with all of them. No profile of Jeannine Palms would be complete without describing these initiatives; they are elemental to her being. ( See the sidebar for a primer.) Because of Jeannine's consistent and determined efforts to teach and promote sustainability, the Ecology Center of Ann Arbor honored her on November 11, 2009 with the Herbert Munzel Award for Environmental Activism. The venerable Bill McKibben, professor at Middlebury College, author of a dozen books about the environment, and founder of 350.org, was on hand to give a speech on global warming. His 1989 book, The End of Nature, is regarded as the first book for a general audience on climate change. Jeannine's ethic, to think globally and act locally, is shared by her partner, Dale Petty, an instructor at Washtenaw Community College. He often joins her on environmental projects. Several times a year, they travel up north to the Jinny Palms Wildlife Preserve just a mile inland from Lake Superior. In 2001, Jeannine bought 360 acres of land \u2014 intact and wild \u2014 on the southern shore of Lake Superior and donated it to the Little Traverse Conservancy. The wildlife preserve is named for Jeannine's mother. Says Conservancy Executive Director Tom Bailey: \"Jeannine Palms is one of this organization's conservation heroes. This latest donation completes the protection of one of the largest contiguous blocks of land the Conservancy has helped protect.\" She and Dale are the stewards for this preserve, as well as for the Lake Superior Nature Sanctuary, a Michigan Nature Association preserve located between the Jinny Palms Preserve and Lake Superior. Jeannine Palms is an unimposing figure who leaves a profound imprint. Scores of her former students, whom she calls \"my kids,\" are now making their way in the world. Mothers and fathers of her current kids drop in to say hi, to help, to hug one or all of the children. They are drawn to Jeannine's warmth and to her calm, inspiring competence and infectious self-confidence.Save the Earth, Tend the Children Continued from page 75 Jeannine asks for the disputed ribbon. (\"May I hold this while we solve the problem?\") The child hands it over. \"You wanted it so much, you forgot to think; you forgot to listen,\" Jeannine says. \"Horses are like people; they like to be treated gently.\" Jeannine and the children sit on the grass for their snack: water and homemade whole-wheat crackers.

The endorphins are why some people like gardening so much.\" Jeannine Palms is an official steward for Buhr Park. The Ecology Center of Ann Arbor honored her in 2009 with the Herbert Munzel Award for Environmental Activism.At a recent Reskilling Festival, Jeannine met a former nanny, Tara Habeck [HAY- beck], who was looking for a new direction. Jeannine asked Tara whether she had considered opening a home pre-school. The idea had not occurred to Tara, who was looking for a new house. \"There's one for rent next door to me,\" Jeannine said. Tara is now Jeannine's neighbor, and a \"Blossom Floricita\" (Little Blossom) will begin sessions this fall. There is already a summer camp program under way. Jeannine gave her waiting list to Tara, and the women now work as partners. Jeannine's discussions with parents of pre-schoolers often involve books on parenting and child development. Jeannine's latest recommendation is: Radical Homemakers: Reclaiming Domesticity from a Consumer Culture by Shannon Hayes. Jeannine and a parent, who stays after the other children have left, enthuse together about the book, whose theme reflects Jeannine's and Blossom Home's ethics. Here is a synopsis: Radical Homemakers is about men and women across the U.S. who focus on home and hearth as a political and ecological act, and who have centered their lives around family and community for personal fulfillment and cultural change. Faced with climate change, dwindling resources, and species extinctions, it is widely understood that we must drive less, consume less, increase self-reliance, buy locally, eat locally, rebuild our local communities. In essence, the great work we face requires rekindling the home fires. The book explores what domesticity looks like in an era that has benefited from feminism, where domination and oppression are cast aside and where the choice to stay home is no longer equated with mind-numbing drudgery, economic insecurity, or relentless servitude. Radical Homemakers nationwide speak about empowerment, transformation, happiness, and casting aside the pressures of a consumer culture.

This latest donation completes the protection of one of the largest contiguous blocks of land the Conservancy has helped protect.\" Jan. 21st Conscious Parenting in online communication forever, but there's definitely an argument to be made for limiting children's use of text messaging and email until high school. So, how do we tame the beast of constant contact (and rushed romances) - at least for a few more years? The following tools and strategies can help. Know Online Policy Restrictions Oftentimes, with children under the age of 13, you don't even have to be the bad guy. Many sites, including Gmail, Google+ and Facebook, require users to be 13 years old to sign up for an account. Yahoo! requires kids under 13 to be linked to a parent's account through a program called Yahoo!Family. This program establishes that the person authorizing the minor account is an adult, by charging a 50-cent credit card fee. In this program, parents can access their child's email and can block senders. (Note: minors often sign up for sites like this by entering a false birth year; however, a site's stated policy gives parents some additional support for addressing this issue with their child.) As an additional precaution, parents can also request that a service provider block or close their child's account. Set Reasonable Limits Although it might be necessary for some kids to have a cell phone, it doesn't need to be turned on or in use 24/7. Texting or Internet options can be turned off entirely in nonsmart phones on most cell phone plans. When it comes to email, parents should have full access to the email of children younger than high-school age. Children are more likely to be careful about what they say if they know there's a chance their parent will be reading along. Be aware that many online platforms, such as Google and Yahoo!, have chat options built into their online interface. Parents who don't want their children chatting online can choose an email provider that doesn't offer chat or may choose to forego email for their children altogether. Connect With Other Parents The easiest way to combat the \"But everyone else is doing it!\" argument is to find out what \"everyone else\" is actually doing. Talking to the parents of your children's friends can provide insight into how other families are addressing media issues. It can also give you an opportunity to share the media/communication limits you have set with your own child and ask that these be respected when your child is visiting. Encourage Face-to-Face Interaction Deborah Dorneman and other teachers at my son's school recognize the need to increase face-to-face interaction among students. \"One of the main reasons why we are discouraging emailing among the students is that it is taking away from direct contact with one another,\" she said. Parents at the school are invited to help decide on a media and communication policy for their child's class (which also constitutes the entire grade). For my son's class, parents have agreed to a no-email-among-classmates policy for the time being. My husband and I promised my son that, in exchange for his giving up emailing his friends, we would arrange for him to spend more time with his friends outside the school day. Now, after a few weeks of additional outings and sleepovers, my son's interest in communicating online has dwindled somewhat. Talk About Communication (and Crushes) As you probably remember, navigating the world of social interaction during the middle school years is no easy trick. It's not always easy to talk to peers - especially those you're crushing on - at any age. Find a space where you can discuss this with your child in a general way, without making it about them specifically. Relate some of your own embarrassing experiences, and talk about what you learned from them. Listen to what your child has to say, and try not to react immediately; just acknowledge his or her feelings (you can always bring something up again later as a way to give guidance, if you need to). Many parents find talking with their child while driving in the car together to be especially helpful because long silences aren't as uncomfortable and eye contact isn't expected. *** As a parent, I have observed preteen social interactions go from painful to hilarious and back again in a single hour. Some of my favorite moments have happened while driving, when I've eavesdropped on backseat conversations between my kids and their friends. (Do they think I'm deaf or just forget I'm there?) I feel good about making sure those in-person conversations keep happening, so the kids can learn as much as possible from them. And I also learn - about the kids' changing needs and styles of communicating with one another. Jen Williams Pavich is mother to Samantha, 18, and Sean, 12.

When I'd see him down the hall of our crowded middle school, I'd feel my face heat up as I blushed furiously. One time in our social studies class, when he asked me if he could borrow a pencil, I could hardly speak. These reactions are familiar to anyone who has been through adolescence - the butterflies, the dry mouth, the brain searching frantically for the right words to say to that one person who turns your world upside down. My 12-year-old son, Sean, like more and more middle-school-aged students, has an email account. We originally set it up so he could stay in touch with his out-of-state grandparents, but he's begun using it more with friends, even those he sees in school every day. I scan his messages occasionally and can see that what's being said is pretty innocuous. It wasn't until I attended a parent meeting where I learned about some rapidly progressing middle-school romances that I really considered the effect that online communication tools can have in the emotional lives of today's 12-year-olds. Back when I had a crush on Andrew, my body worked against me. My palms would get sweaty and my heart would pound. Although I had wanted to act on my feelings for Andrew, I didn't even have the nerve to say hello. Reflecting on these memories, I believe my body knew I wasn't yet ready for romance and held me back. Kids in the twenty-first century have a number of tools for getting around the discomfort of these situations - the primary ones being email and text messaging. When writing an email or a text message, kids have much more time to phrase each idea in the way they think sounds best. And, by declaring their affections via online chat, they don't have to worry about blushing, sweating, or stammering. They can thus progress, in a single evening, though relationship stages that used to take weeks and months, and they can do it without ever seeing the other person. \"Students are stating things in an email that they would not dare to say in person,\" said Deborah Dorneman, my son's sixth-grade teacher. I found myself asking what online communications might be costing today's preteens while sparing them some of the angst of being a young adolescent. On the other hand, don't we want to spare our kids some of that adolescent embarrassment? I have come to the conclusion that preteens stand to lose a great deal by foregoing it. What had initially caught my attention was the issue of hastily formed romances, fanned by the flames of frequent communication via text messaging and email. But I quickly realized that this was part of a much larger question - one having to do with the importance of the whole spectrum of preteen social-emotional development. Online communication replaces some of the face-to-face time that teaches young teens how to interact with their peers. Further, one difficulty young writers experience with online communication is that tone is difficult to convey accurately. Because these young communicators are missing the opportunity to watch the reaction of the recipient, and adjust what they are saying accordingly, communication mishaps are more likely. Replacing too much in-person time with electronic interaction robs kids of opportunities to learn to read social cues, including body language and all of the nonverbal communication that is part of a face-to-face conversation. Learning to read these cues is a skill they'll need, not only to develop healthy personal relationships but also to survive in a professional world that continues to grow more competitive. However, our kids will also likely be called upon to be more and more tech savvy in their adult lives. We can't - nor would we want to - stave off their participation The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 78 [By] declaring their affections via online chat, [preteens] don't have to worry about blushing, sweating, or stammering.

An Evening with Andrew Solomon, a Crazy Wisdom Salon featuring the author of Far from the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity Sunday, March 10th at 4:30 pm in the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room His previous book The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression won the 2001 National Book Award. In Far from the Tree, Andrew Solomon tells the stories of parents who not only learn to deal with their exceptional chil-dren but also find profound meaning in doing so. He writes about families coping with deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, multiple severe disabilities, with children who are prodigies, who are conceived in rape, who become criminals, who are transgender. While each of these characteristics is potentially isolating, the experience of difference within families is universal, as are the triumphs of love Solomon documents in every chapter. Free.

Water does not resist. Water flows. When you plunge your hand into it, all you feel is a caress. Water is not a solid wall, it will not stop you. But water always goes where it wants to go, and nothing in the end can stand against it. Water is patient. Dripping water wears away a stone. Remember that, my child. Remember you are half water. If you can't go through an obstacle, go around it. Water does. ~ Margaret Atwood Book Discussion Groups Crazy Wisdom Monthly Book Discussion Jan. 25, Feb. 22, Mar. 15, April 26; 7:30-9 p.m. at Crazy Wisdom Community Room Each month, a different book is chosen for reading and discussion.

As all three face life in the real world, they will have to reevaluate everything they have learned, creating a new kind of contemporary love story.Feb. 22: Flight Behavior: A Novel by Barbara Kingsolver, hosted by Rachel Pastiva In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural exis-tence. Characters and readers alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction. This novel takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy, Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.Mar. 15: Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity byAndrew Solomon, hosted by Bill Zirinsky National Book Award winner Solomon's startling proposition is that diversity is what unites us all. He writes about families coping with deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, multiple severe disabili - ties, with children who are prodigies, who are conceived in rape, who become criminals, who are transgender. While each of these characteristics are potentially isolating, the experience of difference within families is universal, as are the triumphs of love Solo-mon documents. This book explores themes of generosity, acceptance, and tolerance - all rooted in the insight that love can transcend every prejudice. This crucial and revelatory book expands our definition of what it means to be human. Crazy Wisdom's longtime owners, Bill Zirinsky and Ruth Schekter, were interviewed by Solomon for this book, and there is a four-page section of the book devoted to their family story, (as well as photos of their children, and accompanying audio, on the Disability pages of the Far from the Tree website). (Their older two children, Sam Zirinsky and Juliana Zirinsky, both suffered from the same rare neuro-metabolic, degenerative disorder, and both children died in the 10th year of life.)April 26: Active Hope: How to Face the Mess We're in Without Going Crazy by Joanna Macy, hosted by Karen A'llerio The challenges we face can be difficult to think about. Climate change, the depletion of oil, economic upheaval, and mass extinction together create a planetary emergency of overwhelming proportions. This book shows us how to strengthen our capacity to face this crisis so that we can respond with unexpected resilience and creative power. Drawing on decades of teaching an empowerment approach known as the Work That Reconnects, the author guides us through a transformational process informed by mythic journeys, modern psychology, spirituality, and holistic sci-ence. This process equips us with tools to face the mess we're in and play our role in the collective transition to a life-sustaining society.

Much time and energy is saved that is otherwise spent using habitual patterns of thinking, exchanging superficial information, or being emotionally reactive. Entrepreneurs capitalize on this process to excavate the rich potential in their staff. Focusing skills are similarly used for creative expression by artists, therapists, and teachers. When adults learn to stay in connection with themselves in this way, they listen more skillfully to children's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and to what they say and what they have no words for. Through simple suggestions and the use of language, adults are able to access their own innate wisdom. Teachers and parents have fewer disciplinary issues to deal with and have tools to facilitate children's growth. Focusing skills help teachers with large classes, where several of the students have special needs. Children can be taught to attend to those places in them that feel bad or need something. The children also learn to assist the teacher in attending to those parts of other kids in the class that may be acting out at any given time. Research shows that a lot of time is saved in hospital care when doctors and nursing staff are able to spend a few moments of listening in a Focusing way with patients. A hospitalized patient in distress is less likely to complain and be demanding when he or she feels acknowledged and cared for. Focusing is being taught in the war-torn areas of Afghanistan, using their own cultural metaphors to help them heed parts of themselves that hold anger, grief, and tenderness. They learn to greet their emotions as guests, whom they welcome and invite guidance from. Destructive emotions are transformed into peaceful and constructive actions. The Focusing Institute website (www.focusing.org) summarizes the many areas where Focusing is being used in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas. Joya D'Cruz practices individual and relational psychotherapy in Ann Arbor. She also guides and trains people to use Focusing personally and professionally. Find out more at www.joyadcruz.com or contact her at (734) 219 2555 or joya@joyadcruz.com. By Joya D'Cruz I stand on the sidewalk, noticing buildings, dusty plants, incessant traffic, and people: people scurrying, restless at street corners as they watch for lights to turn green, or just standing. They're standing, looking around; some reading, others gazing into nothing-ness. There's someone drawing closer to a bench where I'm standing. He seems to be taking me in, sensing where my attention is. I look toward him. I smile. He has my full attention now. He smiles somewhat tentative- ly. I invite him in more intentionally with, \"Hi.\" A sense of comfort develops between us. I sense it in my body, even as I notice his shoulders loosening. We seem to be taking each other in, even while we banter about somewhat inconsequential niceties. \"How are you doing this morning?\" I venture, holding his gaze and ready to listen, clearly different from the usual tone of a passing formality. He pauses, probably tak-ing in my sincere expectation of a response. He ventures, \"Not bad,\" seeing me still listening intently. \"Just bothered by something going on at work,\" he sighs. I notice him tensing up again. Still finding he has my attention, he continues to speak. A few minutes later, he hears himself say with emphasis, \"Yes, that's what's really both- ering me!\" He sighs deeply and smiles broadly. He looks relieved. He thanks me for listening, surprised that he had nailed what was really affecting him. I return the smile, so happy for our exchange. He was just listening to himself. I had helped him hold his own attention. It's just like that with Focusing!In Focusing, we consciously invite the presence of something within us \u2014 a feeling, a physical sensation, or anything the Focuser is concerned about. We develop a sense of comfort and make space to listen. We converse with places in us that are trying to be noticed. When they sense our intention to truly engage, without merely trying to fix or get rid of them, they show us all we need to know about what's really going on and help us to move forward. A Focusing Guide invites the Focuser to \"be with\" how something significant feels in his body. This \"being with\" the body sense, the spaciousness, or heaviness has the potential to offer the Focuser what he needs to know. It may offer significant insights, memories, or healing that happens beyond the realm of words and cognition. Perhaps it moves, disperses, gets lighter, or disappears. In typical mindfulness meditation practice, one trains to notice, observe, and allow what is present to be there, just bearing witness to it. This is a powerful practice. One trains not to dwell on one's thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. One also develops the experience of being an observer of all that goes on within and outside of the person. However, what arises in meditation is, in fact, alive \u2014 a responsive aspect of ourselves that is constantly responding to the flux in our lives and interactions, longing to be in relationship with us. Focusing is about being mindful of all that one is in the present moment: physical, intellectual, emotional...and more. It is a process of engaging with all of that within ourselves. Eugene Gendlin created the steps of Focusing after having observed, with his research team, the process that some psychotherapy clients were using to successfully resolve their issues. It is what goes on organically sometimes and can be used more intention-ally for other purposes in daily life. A significant part of Focusing is the allowing of a \"felt sense\" to form in \u2014 and through \u2014 our bodies. This is more than thoughts or emotions or physical sensations. A \"felt sense\" is the way our bodies carry the information about any given experience. It usu-ally begins with a vague sense of a particular idea, feeling, person, or situation. With patient acceptance and non-demanding attention, it comes into focus. In my practice as a psychotherapist, I try to guide, teach, and model for clients how to create safety for places inside themselves that need it. Clients sense the presence of those places as somewhat separate from, and yet so intimately connected to, themselves \u2014 their emotions, beliefs, and issues. When clients begin to see how they can relate with the places in them, they begin to feel more in charge of their lives. Additionally, whatever change needs to happen can unfold with greater ease. People begin to feel \"unstuck,\" and discomfort gives way to fresh new places of joyous living. Focusing: A Way of Living Mindfully Eugene Gendlin created the steps of Focusing after having observed, with his research team, the process that some psychotherapy clients were using to successfully resolve their issues. It is what goes on organically sometimes and can be used more intentionally for other purposes in daily life. When adults learn to stay in connection with themselves in this way, they listen more skillfully to children's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and to what they say and what they have no words for.

Call 662-5215; mandes@comcast.net. Look for tracks in a fresh snowfall and follow them. Make a winter campfire and spend an evening feeding it. Howl at the moon together and giggle when the neighbor's dog responds in kind. Blow bubbles into freezing air or examine snow crystals on black construction paper under magnifying glasses. Look at the bones of the trees. Deciduous stand bare beneath the sky, while conifers create sheltered habitat for wintering birds. Examine the winter landscape in your garden. Fill backyard feeders, learn bird names, watch their feeding patterns, and listen to their songs. Make a ground mandala of seeds and nuts and watch who comes forth. By Pattie Postel I remember lying on my back watching snowflakes fall. It was a vortex of whiteness, and then individual flakes would snap into focus. My face felt the chilly Indiana wind, but my toes were toasty. I shivered, sweaty from dragging the sled up the hill one last time. Our city park's hill had two sledding pathways, the steep incline above and a smaller ridge with a nice dip. Little kids like me stayed on the lower half. This time, as I hit the dip, I was briefly airborne, then crashed. I was probably lying in the flight path, but the snow was so beautiful I was entranced. My older brother appeared and grabbed the ragged rope on the old sled, its wooden slats packed with ice chunks. \"Gotta go. Mom's in the car.\" Further up the slope, high school students had commandeered an old car hood and were about to sail down the hill. We were heading home for hot chocolate and graham crackers. The emotional clarity of that childhood memory is rooted in my relationships with both the natural world and my family. As the education director at the Leslie Science & Nature Center, I also see that winter experience as an encounter with science. I recall the low pressure area that had formed that day; precipitation in the form of snow; my mom's insistence that I wear layers to insulate from the elements; the process of evaporation that in turn brought on the shiver (a mammalian response to increase my metabolic heat); my childhood relationship to friction, through sled runners on the trip down or my lugsole snow boots trudging up the hill. This magical season is a result of our location in the northern hemisphere and the Earth's orbital plane as we move around the sun. What does it mean to embrace the energy of winter? In the natural world, animals hunker down as darkness descends. They use their natural ability to slow themselves, reserving energy for survival. Some migrate; others retreat to dens. Within human cultures, the winter has always been a time of storytelling and gathering with family and community. How does your family tell and create the stories of winter? Are you crafting or reviving the magical memories of childhood winter? Do you reflect and re-charge? Winter offers many ways to draw your family close, share stories, and venture out together for purposeful exploration. I invite you to try a few of the following activities as a family: Declare a tech-free day (put aside all electronics for a day, an evening, or an hour together). Take a winter walk in the full moon and make dancing moon shadows. Learn a new constellation, track the rise of planets in the dark sky, or watch lunar cycles (start with the new moon and follow her every night until full). I remember lying on my back watching snowflakes fall. It was a vortex of whiteness, and then individual flakes would snap into focus.The Magic of Childhood Winter The days are still short, but before the sun sets, enjoy the sledding hill, then a walk through the beautiful stillness of Black Pond Woods watching for signs of winter wanderers. Pattie Postel Education Director at Leslie Science and Nature Center Make a winter campfire and spend an evening feeding it. Howl at the moon together and giggle when the neighbor's dog responds in kind.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 94The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 95 Wonder together about things: start a dozen sentences with \"I wonder,\" then research together for answers. Embody curiosity about the natural world. Come in from your sledding, hiking, snow sculptures, and snow angels to share cups of hot chocolate or try a new tea together. Pick out a new cookie recipe and fill the house with the toasty heat of the oven and the wafting smells of deliciousness. Trudge through the snow to deliver a dozen cookies to a neighbor \u2014 an apology for all the howling! Winter is a time for remembering the bountiful harvest of the late summer garden, the return to school, the beauty and color of fall, your Thanksgiving. With spring approaching, it is also a time to observe how the quality of light shifts as we mark the Vernal Equinox (ah...the return of heat and light). For now, believe that the seeds will soon be stirring beneath the soil. Embrace how this winter season, filled with darkness and stilled energies, renews and restores us so that we too can push upward into the activity of spring. Finally, remember that the cycle is always beginning anew; the wheel of the year is ever turning, and we are all moving with the rhythms of the natural world. I invite you to the Leslie Science & Nature Center for your outdoor winter adventure. Stroll on our new accessible pathway through the raptor enclosures; see how our magnificent birds are outfitted to handle winter. Scan the winter skies overhead for soaring Turkey Vultures or Red-tailed Hawks. Check our website for the current programs, weekend raptor feeding hours, and open hours at the Critter House. There you can observe some native species, and chat with staff about the incredible diversity of our natural world. Enjoy changing exhibits and new animal displays. Right outside the Critter House windows, watch the wildlife feeding stations; pick up a field guide to identify the chickadees, nuthatches, and woodpeckers. The days are still short, but before the sun sets, enjoy the sledding hill, then a walk through the beautiful stillness of Black Pond Woods watching for signs of winter wanderers. I suspect, while making their winter rounds, they, too, may be dreaming of the promise of spring! See you on the trail! Pattie Postel, Education Director at the Leslie Science & Nature Center, can be reached at pattie@lesliesnc.org. She hopes you'll make a winter outing to the Leslie Science & Nature Center, located at 1831 Traver Road on the north side of Ann Arbor, right next to Leslie Park Golf Course.

Serving and celebrating the body/mind/spirit community in southeas in southeastern Michigan for 17 years. Editorial integrity. Depth of coverage. Local focus. Local writers, photographers, and illustrators. Here to stay. The history of Qigong goes back farther than written records. Picto- graphs and petroglyphs depict people in Qigong-like postures. Sha-mans led Chinese tribal people in ritual dances that imitated animal movements. The animal movements later became the foundation of healing Qigong exercises. There are thousands of forms of Qigong. Some of the general cat- egories of Qigong include martial art forms (such as Tai Chi Chuan), spiritual (Taoist, Buddhist, and so on), and medical (used for self-healing or the healing of others). Most Qigong forms are done standing, but some are practiced sit-ting or lying down. Some are still, while others involve slow move-ment. The focus is on the breathing, with the goal of generating and circulat-ing the Qi (life force). The core practices of Qigong are movement, breathing, meditation, and self-massage. Doing Qigong triggers natural healing resources and balances the body. The exercises increase the delivery of oxygen to all of the organ systems. Qi-gong improves the function-ing of the immune system by transporting immune cells through the lymph sys-tem. The focus on the breath while doing Qigong triggers the relaxation response. In the 1960s, Dr. Herbert Benson at Harvard Uni-versity discovered the relaxation response while researching high blood pressure. The relaxation response reverses the fight-or-flight response, also called the stress response. The fight-or-flight response prepares the body to react to a threat by either running or fighting. It was neces - sary for primitive people to survive. The fight-or-flight response causes the body to release chemicals that increase heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension. It is still useful today in dealing with emergency situations. However, chronic stress can cause negative long-term effects, such as high blood pressure. The relaxation response causes heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension to decrease . After the Health & Wellness Coach training at Omega, I used the simple Qi-gong movements in my group coaching programs. I liked the moves and decided I wanted to learn more. I bought all of the Qigong videos I could find. I was al-ways amazed at how wonderful I felt after practicing with them. I wanted to learn more Qigong to do on my own. In January 2010, I decided to sign up for a Qigong training of-By Erin Reas Photography by Kelly Dobson I was introduced to Qigong by Dr. Roger Jahnke at the Omega Institute in Sep- tember 2007 while attending a Health & Wellness Coach training. Having had a stressful job as a pharmacist and a heart attack two years previously at the age of 40, I was very interested in learning simple ways to relax. My pharmaceutical training had taught me about the autonomic nervous system and biochemistry and I always have been interested in using science to explain practices that are thousands of years old. Another thing that drew me to learning Qigong was that I had explored the power of the mind/body connection from us-ing a guided imagery CD to help me prepare for a surgery a few months before. I was amazed at how quickly I healed and how little pain medication I needed. Qigong (pronounce chee-gung) is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine, along with acupuncture, massage, and herbal medicine. The word Qi means energy or life force. It is similar to the term Prana used in yoga and Ki from Reiki. The word gong means to practice, cultivate, or refine. Qi - gong can be thought of as acupuncture without needles. Pharmacist Discovers the Power of the Medicine Within through Qigong I always have been interested in using science to explain practices that are thousands of years old. Erin Reas is a pharmacist and Qigong practitioner, as well as a Certified Health and Wellness Coach. Her Calendar Listing can be found in the Exercise & Fitness section on page 90 .The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 102The benefits of Qigong are not just physical. It connects mind, body , and spirit. It can be used by someone seeking better health, an executive wanting more concen- tration, an athlete with the goal of peak performance, or a spiritual student seeking enlightenment. Qigong is a system of personal development \u2014 physi-cally, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. This is best described by the following quote from The Healing Promise of Qi, by Roger Jahnke, OMD. \"Understand Qi. Access Qi. Cultivate Qi. Master Qi. It is the essential fuel behind all intention and action. It is the awesome power of the Universe within you... Qi is your edge in sports, business, relation-ships, and personal performance. Tai Chi and Qigong are powerful tools, profound yet simple, that will assist you in fulfilling your inten - tion, needs, goals \u2014 even your dreams!\" I am now a Certified Tai Chi Easy and Qigong Practice Leader through the Institute of Integral Qigong and Tai Chi. I have improved my physical and emotional health and deal with stress more easily. I share the practices that have transformed my life through leading classes in the metro-Detroit area.

That winter was very stressful for me. I ended up in the hospital in February with chest pain. My tests came back negative, but I had problems with my heart beating faster than normal and was getting out of breath from walking a short distance. My cardiologist put me on dif-ferent medicine, which made me tired and caused my brain to feel foggy. I went to the training in April feeling worn out. I had a wonderful healing take place during that week in Texas. I remember being light headed from my medicine at the first morning practice session and wonder - ing if I could get through it without sitting down. As the days went on, I felt better and better. During our three times a day practice sessions, I could feel my hands tingling from the medicine within (Qi) being activated and circulated throughout my body. On the last night, we had a party complete with dancing and a disco ball. I danced and danced and danced. The next day I couldn't believe how much danc-ing I had done. The frequent practice sessions had triggered the Relaxation Response, shifting my biochemistry out of the adrenaline charged state I had been in prior to the training. The Relaxation Response brought my body back into balance and allowed it to function properly again. I went home and practiced what I learned. I was able to go off the medicine that made me feel lousy by healing my body with Qigong. Qigong improves the functioning of the immune system by transporting immune cells through the lymph system.The frequent practice sessions had triggered the Relaxation Response, shifting my biochemistry out of the adrenaline charged state I had been in prior to the training.

Crazy Wisdom Salon Series An Evening with Local Buddhist Lama, Traktung Yeshe Dorje, Author of a New Book, Eye to Form is only Love: A Journal of 100 Days Hosted by Bill Zirinsky Thursday, March 14th at 7:00 pm Traktung is an American born lama in the Nyingma lineage of Vajrayana Buddhism. He and his wife, Katie, are the leaders of the Tsogyelgar Dharma Center on West Liberty. For 100 days, Traktung kept of a journal of short reflections. Some mornings, the heartbreaking poetry of devotion, or essays in celebration of dawn, light, trees; on others, razor-like distinctions about the nature of the mind, challenges to conventional views of seeing, or seething commentary on the shallowness of contemporary culture. \"This is the teacher the various western Buddhist 'authorities' warned me about... In a world of new age soft core strategies here are the crossed swords of Vajra Gangsterism: asking you, 'will you risk it all for love?'\" \"Offers a rare glimpse of 100 days of the enlightened mind -- full of deep mysteries like Krishnamurti's journals or the poetry of Rumi and Hafiz.\" Food as a Path to Health and Healing with Joel Robbins and Gail Solway Hosted by Lucinda Kurtz Thursday, March 28th at 7:00 pm This Salon explores the relationship between food, health and healing from the perspective of a Chinese Medicine Practitioner and a visionary pharmacist, continuing our lively community discussion initiated during previous Food Salons.

For more info, contact Lucinda at lkurtz@fairfoodnetwork.org \"Leave your potions in the chemist's crucible if you can handle your patients with food.\" Hippocrates Lucid Dreaming as a Spiritual Journey with Author Robert Waggoner Hosted by Sandy Wiener Thursday, April 11th at 7:00 pm Waggoner wrote the acclaimed book Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self after 30 years of lucid dreaming and more than 1,000 lucid dreams. He is a past President of the International Association for the Study of Dreams. On the surface, lucid dreaming seems deceptively simple - a paradoxical state in which you realize you are dreaming, while you are dreaming . There, you can fly through space, create fire breathing dragons, and cast spells like Harry Potter, all in the safety of your subconscious mind. Historically though, experienced lucid dreamers have used lucid dreaming as an expressway to greater self-realization, spiritual wisdom and liberation from samsara. Sandy Wiener, after following a traditional educational vector, has led a non-linear life for many years. Work in Africa and Asia (100 countries visited now); politics; government; journalism; and the entrepreneurial world (including starting New York City's first wine bar). Now he is a student of transpersonal psychology, consciousness and anomalous phenomena. He is a member of the Society for Scientific Exploration.

Well, I hope that if you are out there and read this and know that, yes, it's true I'm here, and I'm just as strange as you. ~ Frida Kahlo The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2013 Page 112 Continued on page 114We wouldn't say to an exchange student, \"This is how it is.\" Instead we say, \"This is how it is in our country. How is it in your country?\" If we substitute a type identity for a nationality, we very quickly have a way of understanding the other person better and are on the road toward knowing \"what's up with that?\" when they do or say something that puzzles us. When we take the time to consider another's enneatype, we see how a particular action or statement may be different from what it would be coming from those of our type. We also frequently offer others what we personally want. If we have a pretty good idea of the other person's type, we can more easily adjust our offerings to match what they are really seeking; or at least understand why they are perturbed when we offer them diamonds when they are looking for bread. We may still choose not to bake them a loaf or two, but at least we're closer to understanding their disappointment. Another relationship that can be greatly enhanced is the one between our ego self and our true self. It is helpful to be able to identify behaviors and thoughts that arise from our true being and those that are adaptive. If it is adaptive, we might want to ask, \"How's that working for me?\" Our type reactions are often so automatic that we mistake the view through the lens of our enneatype for reality. Knowing about our Enneagram type enables us to be open to a larger reality and to hold our stories with a looser hand. When we can do that, our true self has room to emerge. Our type's passion or vice is what powers our ego self; on the other side of that is our virtue. For type six, The Loyal Skeptic, fear is the passion, but on the other side of that is courage. For type six to experience their virtue, the vice needs to relax. The virtue comes with the territory and is an expression of the true self. Last but not least, knowledge of the Enneagram illuminates our relationship with the Divine and helps to deepen it. If ego is what separates us from the Divine, then it makes sense that through working with the wisdom of the Enneagram, we can become closer to the Divine. Each of the Enneagram types has a special understanding of the Divine and the Divine order of the universe. This always reminds me of the story of the elephant and the blind men. Several blind men were each touching a part of an elephant. The first one said, \"An elephant is like a snake.\" The next one said, \"No! It is like a wall.\" The third one said, \"It is like a tree trunk.\" Just like the blind men in this story, each of us has a strong, deep, and partial understanding of the Divine. Type fours, or Romantics, yearn for connection, even though within them is a deep understanding that this connection already exists and all beings are interrelated. This is the aspect of the Divine they hold within them. We can use our knowledge of the Enneagram to free ourselves from the constraints of the type structure and fully enter into our relationship with the Divine. I encourage you to take the Enneagram personality test in The Essential Enneagram by David Daniels, M.D., and Virginia Price, Ph.D., or at www. enneagramworldwide.com. You might also attend a workshop or have a personal consultation. The Enneagram can be a powerful ally as we seek relationships with the people in our lives, our true self, and the Divine.

By Su Hansen Have you been intrigued by the Enneagram and wondered which one of the nine personality types describes you? Or have you thought, who needs another typology to complicate my life? The Enneagram is not just another typology. It's a complex understanding of people and how they relate to each other, the world, their true selves and even the Divine. In fact, when I think Enneagram, I think relationships. That might be because I am a type four, The Romantic, part of the heart triad, the threesome who value connection beyond all else. We can also see the relationships when we look at the symbol. The nine personality types (or enneatypes, \"ennea\" meaning nine) are arranged in a circle with a pattern of lines and arrows. All the enneatypes are connected with each other through the lines or proximity to one another, just like all people are connected. Every human being has taken on the personality of one of these nine types, with aspects of the enneatypes most closely connected with them interplaying as well. Each of the types has a particular ingrained strategy for survival and satisfaction. For instance, the strategy for type two, The Giver, is giving in order to get and being needed in order to be loved. From our type strategy, each of us develops a focus of attention. In the case of type two, the focus of attention is on other people's needs and how to meet those needs. The type structure also develops as a set of beliefs, behaviors, and reactions to whatever we may face in life, all in the service of surviving and feeling okay. All of these strategies work to an extent, but they also limit our actions and our view and bind up our energy. Knowing about the nine enneatypes can really help us with our relationships with others; our most intimate ones down to that annoying co-worker. One of the difficulties we have in relating with others is that we try to understand their actions or words from our own worldview. I have often said that we would all be better off if we treated others the way that we treat foreign exchange students. Relating with the Enneagram The Enneagram is not just another typology.
