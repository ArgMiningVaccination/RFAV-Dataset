Gianna is currently receiving her doctorate degree in acupuncture and Chinese Medicine where she is trained in many healing modalities including acupuncture, fire cupping, gua sha, and herbal therapy. Her focuses include classical 5-Element acupuncture which focuses heavily on the psyche, the emotional body, and the spirit, and is known as the shamanic branch of acupuncture. 5-element acupuncture is extremely effective for chronic diseases, emotional imbalances, and processing trauma. She also focuses on menstrual regulation and balancing as well as cosmetic acupuncture and facial rejuvenation. Cosmetic acupuncture reduces signs of the aging process, minimizes fine lines + wrinkles, and strengthens the facial muscles for a balancing and lifting effect allowing you to shine from the inside AND out!

Entheobreath is a self healing process that uses conscious, connected breathing to heal trauma stored in the subconscious. I create retreat and workshop experiences where I combine these amazing healing modalities alongside the heart opening power of kava ceremony. I look forward to sharing these tools with you that have helped me so much on my journey. You deserve to feel good. Aspen Arora Aspen Arora is a Wounded Healer, Veteran, and Creator.
