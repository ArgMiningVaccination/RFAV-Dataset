Blood plasma obtained from the hyperimmunised horses which is rich in antibodies to tetanus toxin, is enzyme refined purified and concentrated. The antitoxin has the specific power of neutralising the toxin secreted by clostridium tetani, the causative organism of tetanus. use in prophylaxis : a dose of 1500 international units of tetanus antitoxin should be injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly, after testing for serum sensitivity (see below for reactions to horse serum).

Company Details About the Company Dr. Waldemar Mordecai Haffkine, was born on 15th March, 1860 in Odessa, Russia. An illustrious disciple of Dr.Aleck Metchnikoff and Dr.Louis Pasteur, Dr Haffkine arrived in Calcutta in 1892 with a mission to tackle the problem of a Cholera epidemic. He arranged for clinical trials of his vaccine and successfully helped to combat the dreadful disease from spreading further. When plague broke out in 1896, he was invited to set up a Plague Research Laboratory in Mumbai . It was later renamed as Haffkine Institute in 1925.With a view to expand the production activities and to meet the growing demands for medicines & life saving drugs, the Haffkine Institute was bifurcated by Government of Maharashtra in 1975 and the production activities were entrusted to HAFFKINE BIO-PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION LTD. , a fully owned Govt. of Maharashtra Company, registered under the Companies Act,1956. Haffkine Ajintha Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a subsidiary of Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation Ltd. , was established in 1977. The Corporation plays a pioneering role in the development and production of a wide range of Bacterial and Viral vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, plague, poliomyelitis and rabies.. The Corporation also formulates pharmaceutical products, disinfectants , ointments, injectables, syrups and mixtures. The Antitoxin and Sera department of HBPCL is located at Pimpri near Pune, and it is engaged in the manufacture of Antiserum against Tetanus, Diphtheria, Gas gangrene, Snake and Scorpion Venoms. The ATS department was established in 1940 at Mumbai for production of Anti Snake Venom Serum (ASVS) and subsequently shifted to Pimpri from 1952-53 onwards in a phased manner. The ATS dept operates on 75 acres of land and it is headed by Manager and assisted by different technical and nontechnical staff. The total staff strength at present is about 133. About 400 equines are also maintained to produce various antisera. The antisera are produced by HBPCL at most economical and affordable prices and are supplied mainly to various states and Central Government Institutions including defence. All the antisera are produced by hyperimmunising the equines by injecting gradually increasing doses of antigens (Venom/Toxin) over a period of 6 to 8 months. Once the equines attain a certain level of potency against the antigen, blood is collected in an anticoagulant solution from the equines every month and the blood is allowed to stand overnight. Next day the plasma is separated and the Red Blood Cells are reinfused into the body of equines (Plasmapheresis). The separated plasma that contains specific immunoglobulins is further processed by enzyme digestion and chemical separation to obtain purified equine immunoglobulins. The serum is tested for safety and potency on mice and then contenarised for distribution. Seller Contact Details Acharya Donde Marg, Mumbai - 400012, Maharashtra, India Have a requirement?
