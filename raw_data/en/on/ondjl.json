Medically reviewed by [Drugs.com](/support/editorial_policy.html#drugs-com). Last updated on March 21, 2023. I am having a few side effects and have stopped taking it and I want the side effects to go away! It takes approximately 16.5 to 22 hours for Prednisone to be out of your system. The elimination half life of prednisone is around 3 to 4 hours. This is the time it takes for your body to reduce the plasma levels by half. It usually takes around 5.5 x half-life for a drug to be completely eliminated from your system. This is (5.5 x 3) 16.5 hours to (5.5 x 4) 22 hours for Prednisone. Other factors also need to be taken into account and include: 1. How much and how often you have taken the drug. 2. Your metabolic rate - a slower metabolism will increase the time a drug remains in your system. 3. Your age and health - older age and poor health will generally increase the time the drug stays in your system. 4. Body mass - generally the bigger you are the longer a drug will remain in your system.
