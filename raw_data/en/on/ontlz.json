While chiropractic care is not typically considered a specific allergy treatment, it works with your body to push function to an optimal level. So, could chiropractic care help your allergies this season? Immune Diseases When your body fails to recognize and remove abnormal cells, your system could struggle with infection, react badly to foreign substances or try to attack itself. The most common immune disorder is an allergic reaction, which is prevalent among every part of the public. Many people struggle with some kind of environmental-, seasonal- or food-related allergies. How Does Chiropractic Therapy Affect Allergies? When the body overacts to an allergen, you have an allergic reaction. Your immune system is responsible for removing anything from the system which it believes is foreign, explaining the violent reaction to foreign particles it deems are harmful. Instead of using medication to cover up the symptoms, chiropractic care addresses root causes so your body can heal itself. When one or more of the bones of your spine (vertebrae) move out of position and create pressure on, or irritate spinal nerves, the symptoms in your body can be compromised. Chiropractic adjustments remove the interference and allow blood flow, nutrients and fresh oxygen to flow through the body. By boosting the immune system with all natural treatments, symptoms are lessened because of the lessening of the attack from the confused immune system (and not in spite of it). The Relationship of Nerves on Your Immune System Your chiropractor understands that nerves are relevant to the immune system's function. Studies in psychoneuroimmunology have connected the effect of nerves on the immune system. We follow the meric system as an ancient chiropractic practice that the spine corresponds with every part of the body. With a hands-on approach to body alignment, sublaxations are removed along with the stress placed on the nervous system. The Danger of Traditional Methods Traditional medicine has no cure for allergies - merely a few Band-Aids you can hide the symptoms with (namely, allergies relief pills). These masking medications make it difficult for you to take your allergies serious enough and alter your habits in a way that helps your body. Instead, medications can cause dangerous side effects, complications and can cause a foggy haze over your daily activities. Instead of finding true relief, patients find themselves in a circular habit of taking allergy relief medications daily with no end in sight.
