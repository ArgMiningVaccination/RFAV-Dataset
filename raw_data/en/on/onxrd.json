People use crystals to find mental and spiritual peace, and many believe spiritual energy within crystals can help with physical healing. Just like you might feel drained from time to time, crystals need to recharge and replenish their energy, too. Cleansing crystals washes away negativity, and charging them refills the force that makes these stones so grounding and powerful. Programming crystals allows you to align your energy with theirs so they can help you work towards your visions and goals. There's an abundance of cleansing and charging methods out there, so we've created a comprehensive guide for you. As you read on, understand there's no \"wrong\" or \"best\" way to charge your crystals, so choose the methods that resonate with your heart, energy, and intentions today. This article is based on an interview with our spiritual advisor and reiki master, Emily Christensen, founder of Rainbow Raaja.

Just like we shower or bathe to wash off negative energy, washing crystals allows negativity to flow into the water and run down the drain. Hold your crystals under any kind of running water (even your sink tap) for about a minute.

Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja - 2Submerge your crystals in salt water for healing. This method promotes cleansing the same way that salt water promotes cleansing for cuts. [[3]](#_note-3)X Research source [Use Himalayan salt or Celtic salt, and soak your crystals for a few minutes to an hour.](#) Advertisement - This method also combines the elemental forces of water and earth, since salt is considered a pure form of earth. - Don't do this with blue/black kyanite, or selenite since they'll dissolve in water. Similarly, hematite will rust in water. [[4]](#_note-4)X Research source - 3Place your crystals on snow to promote meditation and reflection. When fresh snow falls over the earth, it creates a beautiful blank canvas for nature. Cleaning your crystals with snow allows them to reset and find stillness. If you're fortunate enough to have access to snow, gather some pure snow into a bowl. Set your crystals on top of the snow and let them soak in until you sense their energy has been refreshed. [[5]](#_note-5)X Research source - Only use crystals that will not dissolve or rust in water. Don't use black/blue kyanite, selenite, or hematite. - 4Cover your crystals with earth for stability. Earth is an element of beauty, steady change, and growth. When you're feeling a little anxious or need to reconnect with your body, let your crystals rest in the soil. Bury them outside in the dirt and leave them overnight. [[6]](#_note-6)X Research source - Crystals that resonate with earth energy include red jasper, mookaite jasper, and black tourmaline. [[7]](#_note-7)X Research source - Don't bury blue/black kyanite or selenite because those crystals may dissolve from the moisture in the ground. - Crystals that resonate with earth energy include red jasper, mookaite jasper, and black tourmaline. - 5Submerge your crystals in a bowl of dry salt for earth energy. This is a great earth energy alternative for crystals that can't be submerged in salt water or moist ground. Fill a bowl with Himalayan or Celtic salt. If possible, take the bowl out of your house to leave behind any negative energy. Let the crystals sit for 24 hours.

Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja - Feel free to add herbs like rosemary to the salt bath. - 6Burn sage or Palo Santo for sacred energy. Tap into an ancient purifying tradition with this method. Simply hold each crystal and pass it over the smoke several times until you feel the negative energy lift. [[12]](#_note-12)X Research source [As you perform the ritual, ask the sacred smoke to clear the crystals of their energy. Likewise, ask the crystals to release the energy they're holding.](#) [[13]](#_note-13)X Research source - Perform this ritual outside or open your windows to prevent your smoke alarm from going off. - 7Purify and charge your crystals simultaneously with sound. Play healing music (you can find crystal cleansing compilations online) or use healing bowls. Healing bowls are special instruments that produce powerful resonant harmonics when played. Set your crystals in an arc around the speaker or healing bowl so they can absorb the vibration as you play the music. [[14]](#_note-14)X Research source - 8Lay your crystals on a slab of selenite for clarity and protection. Selenite is a powerful crystal named after the Greek moon goddess Selene. As a result, it has strong connections to lunar cycles and divine femininity.

This would totally make my day: Charging Your Crystals - 1Set your crystals in the moonlight for calm, intuitive energy. Moonlight gives off a soft, feminine energy. Allow your crystals to charge by setting them on a windowsill or leaving them outside overnight. [[17]](#_note-17)X Research source - Charging crystals in moonlight is great for reflection and healing.

Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja - Charging crystals in moonlight is great for reflection and healing. - 2Place the crystals in the sunlight for active energy. The sun represents invigorating, masculine energy. Simply set your crystals by a sunny window or outside where they'll be exposed to the vibrant rays.

Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja - For balanced yin-yang energy, place the crystals outside for 24 hours to experience both sun and moon forces. - Do not charge rose quartz and amethyst in the sun. The sun can fade their color. [[21]](#_note-21)X Research source - 3Set your crystals outside during an eclipse for power. Allowing your crystals to soak up the energy of an eclipse (or another astrological event) is an incredibly strong way to charge them. This method will magnify their energies. [[22]](#_note-22)X Research source - 4Make a charging circle to connect multiple energies. Point cleansed rock crystals (not tumbled crystals) towards one specific crystal you'd like to charge. You can leave the crystal charging for as long as you'd like, but let it connect to the other crystals' energy for at least 30 minutes. [[23]](#_note-23)X Research source - 5Rub the crystals in your hands to charge them quickly. Using your body heat to charge your crystals is a direct, easy way to activate their energy. Plus, you get to build and deepen your physical connection to the crystal. [[24]](#_note-24)X Research source - 6Charge your crystals with reiki for inner peace. Find a deep meditative state by closing your eyes and focusing on your breathing. [[25]](#_note-25)X [Expert Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience) [Emily Christensen](/Author/Emily-Christensen)Expert Interview. 8 July 2020. Picture a bright white light flowing into all the chakra points of your body. Point your palms towards the crystal and direct that energy towards the stone. Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja [[26]](#_note-26)X Research source Programming Your Crystals - 1Hold one crystal in your non-dominant hand. Putting the crystal into your \"receptive\" hand will allow you to sense its energy. Keep it in your palm for a few minutes and ask yourself: \"Does this make me feel calm or active?\" If the crystal's energy doesn't match the intention you'd like to set, try another crystal. [[27]](#_note-27)X Research source - The non-dominant hand is your receptive \"yin\" or moon hand. - Don't rush the process. If you can't sense the energy, carry the crystal around for a few days. - 2Switch the crystal into your dominant hand. Your dominant hand is your \"projective\" hand, which sends energy into the crystal. That hand contains active \"yang\" sun energy. [[28]](#_note-28)X Research source - 3Close your eyes and visualize what you want to manifest. Use all five senses to imagine what you want in your life. Activating all five senses allows you to create a vivid new concept of what reality could be. [[29]](#_note-29)X Research source - 4Carry the crystal with you. You and your crystal both have an energy field, and you want to let those fields resonate. Wearing the crystal or putting it into your pocket allows you to absorb the vibration of the reality you manifested in the crystal. In turn, the universe will match the vibration you're putting back out and return it to you. [[30]](#_note-30)X Research source - Just remember, the universe won't make your manifestations a reality on its own. For instance, if you're hoping to find love, the universe won't send a significant other to your door. However, if you go out and meet new people with your crystal, you might encounter new opportunities. [[31]](#_note-31)X Research source - Just remember, the universe won't make your manifestations a reality on its own. For instance, if you're hoping to find love, the universe won't send a significant other to your door. However, if you go out and meet new people with your crystal, you might encounter new opportunities.
