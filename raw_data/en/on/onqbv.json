These are signs that a person may have [Lyme disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651), an infectious disease that humans can contract when they are bitten by an infected tick. Lyme, a bacterial infection, can take a while to develop, and can cause chronic symptoms if it is not treated effectively. Acupuncture and TCM offer an alternative or adjunct way to help resolve the painful, debilitating symptoms of long-term Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a type of bacterial infection transmitted by ticks. Ticks are parasitic arachnids, small spider-like creatures who bite other animals and feed on blood. If a tick is infected with a disease, it can infect the person or other animal it bites. Lyme disease, which is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium, is just one of several infectious diseases that ticks can spread, including [Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF)](https://www.sepsis.org/sepsisand/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/). These critters are sometimes called \"deer ticks\" or \"bear ticks\" because they generally thrive in forest environments where they live symbiotically with these kinds of animals. But being bit by deer tick (tick on deer) doesn't only happen in deeply wooded areas; anywhere that deer, squirrels, lizards, or birds may come into suburban areas, it is possible to be bitten by a tick. Actually, ticks, and therefore the infectious diseases they carry, are growing more prevalent because of humans encroaching into animals' habitats. Tick bites most commonly occur in spring and summer. Ticks do not fly; they can only get onto dogs or humans by crawling on them. This can happen quite easily if a tick is on a bush or other plant, and a person or dog brushes up against it. Ticks attach themselves to a host, and slowly suck their blood. [Lyme disease in dogs](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/lyme-disease-in-dogs/) cannot be transmitted to humans, nor is lyme disease contagious, passing from human to human; you can only get Lyme disease by being bitten yourself. [In order to pass Lyme disease to a person,](https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/lyme-disease/lyme-disease/10-facts-about-lyme/) a tick generally has to have been attached to that person's skin for 36 hours or more. Ticks can be as small as the head of a pin, and they burrow in moist, hairy areas of their host's body, so it is actually quite easy to have a tick on you without knowing it. After the tick drops off, a person may not feel anything at all, or only have a small, red bump that resembles a mild insect bite. In some cases, though, a person may feel right away that the area of the bite is hot, swollen, or causing a burning sensation. If the tick was carrying Lyme disease, it can take several days to a few weeks for the more serious symptoms of Lyme to develop. Even then, the symptoms are not necessarily distinctive. The early [symptoms of Lyme disease](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/index.html) can feel like a flu; fever, fatigue, aches and pains. Not everyone infected with Lyme will have the characteristic tick bullseye rash that develops around the site of the tick bite. When treated promptly with antibiotics, most cases of Lyme disease will resolve within a few weeks. However, many cases of Lyme disease are not diagnosed right away, and if it goes undetected, chronic problems can develop in the ensuing months. Once the bacteria has spread throughout the body, even a long course of antibiotics may not be able to get rid of it. Long-term Lyme symptoms may appear similar to other chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, or neurological conditions, such as [fibromyalgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [Bell's palsy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bells-palsy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [MS](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-ms-how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [chronic fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) syndrome, cases Lyme disease causes [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/), hip pain, knee pain, fatigue, and other symptoms so severe that people can't go about their regular daily routine. Sometimes diagnosis and treatment is further complicated by coinfections: concurrent other infections, that can also have been transmitted via the tick bite, or occur independently of it. Lyme and other tick-borne illnesses like RMSF can also trigger sepsis infections, which can be life-threatening, or lead to chronic pain, and/or PTSD (post-traumatic [stress disorder](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)). An [MRSA skin infection](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/symptoms-causes/syc-20375336) (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), a type of staph infection that enters the skin through a wound, can develop around the infected tick bite; this staph skin infection is particularly resistant to antibiotics. Unfortunately, symptoms of Lyme can become progressively worse over time, leading to disability and even death. Acupuncture and TCM offer an alternative for helping to heal Lyme disease, whether it is still in the early stages, or when it has become a [chronic infectious disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23400696/). Top 10 Symptoms of Lyme Disease Signs of Lyme disease develop slowly, in stages, and can vary widely from person to person. Without the presence of the tell-tale bulls' eye rash, both patients and doctors may have difficulty linking the spectrum of symptoms to a Lyme infection. - Joint pain, swollen joins, [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Neuropathy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), numbness or tingling, Bell's palsy (face drooping) - Fatigue - Bulls-eye rash, also known as [Sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [sleep - Brain fog - Trouble breathing - Vertigo, dizziness - Blurred vision Other possible symptoms of Lyme include: [ringing in the ears (tinnitus)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [problems with memory](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [concentration](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), vision problems or inflammation around the eyes, and liver problems, like hepatitis. [Symptoms of lyme disease in dogs](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-dogs/lyme-disease-lyme-borreliosis-in-dogs) are similar to those in humans, including stiff, swollen joints, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Long-term effects of Lyme disease are sometimes referred to as \" [post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.](https://www.aldf.com)\" Doctors are not sure why some people, even after being treated with antibiotics, seem to still be affected by long-term effects of Lyme disease. Medical Diagnosis and Treatment of Lyme Disease Getting a clear diagnosis of Lyme disease can be difficult. Currently, there is a [two-step diagnostic process](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/diagnosistesting/index.html) recommended to determine if a person has contracted Lyme disease. Two main [kinds of tests](https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-disease-test/) can detect antibodies the body's immune system creates to fight off the infection. However, it takes a while-at least several weeks, usually-for the body to build up enough of the antibodies that they become detectable. Often when people are aware early on that they may have been infected, and they get a test, it turns out to be negative. Usually, doctors try first one type of antibody test, and then the other to see if they get a positive result. Even then, medical science acknowledges that many (perhaps half of) Lyme disease cases are not detected this way. A newer, still somewhat unproven form of testing involves taking a blood culture and trying to grow the bacteria that cause Lyme in a laboratory setting. This testing is more advanced and may be difficult for patients to access. Once physicians have determined that Lyme infection is present, the usual [ treatment](https://www.columbia-lyme.org/treatment-options) is a course of antibiotics that lasts a few to several weeks. In many cases, this seems to clear up the infection. In others, though, the antibiotics do not resolve the myriad symptoms patients are experiencing. Using antibiotics on a long-term basis is often not effective, and carries other risks to a person's health. Ongoing joint pain and inflammation is then usually treated with steroid medications or NSAIDS. Sleep problems and fatigue are often treated with antidepressants. These medications may help relieve symptoms temporarily, but they come with side effects, and do not address the root causes of the chronic symptoms of Lyme disease. 3 Stages of Lyme Disease When early detection occurs, the Western medical approach of using antibiotics can often resolve Lyme disease within a few to several weeks. However, if the infectious disease is not found soon enough, Lyme disease will progress to more advanced stages. TCM methods can be helpful during all three stages of Lyme. - First Stage Lyme disease - Within the first few weeks of the infection, and with early detection, antibiotics can be very helpful, working pretty well to stop the spread of the bacteria. However, because Lyme disease is often misdiagnosed, many people do not receive this treatment soon enough. During this phase, the symptoms are similar to those of the flu: chills, fatigue, heaviness in the limbs. As the infection moves in deeper, it can cause the skin rash, or hives. TCM treatment during the first stage will focus on clearing heat and detoxifying the body to rid it of infection. - Second Stage Lyme disease - If the bacteria causing Lyme disease is not halted in its spread, it begins to affect the organs and the blood. The central nervous system and heart can become infected. These infections can last for months, and if not taken care of, can develop into the third phase. This is when a person may begin to feel joint aches, and arthritis-like symptoms. The body's Qi and blood become deficient. Treatment with acupuncture and herbs at this point will work to help boost the Qi, clear heat and strengthen the whole immune system, and clear inflammation. - Advanced stage Lyme disease - As the infection drags on, it can cause joint, skin, and nerve damage can take hold. Ongoing Qi and blood deficiency and stagnation cause fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, and memory loss. A TCM provider will recognize what stage of Lyme disease a patient is in according to their symptoms, and customize the acupuncture points and herbal formulae used depending on their needs. Acupuncture for Infectious Diseases For millennia, TCM has recognized a type of disease that is caused by infection and can affect all systems of the body. We call this type of illness [Gu zheng](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2019/07/26/lyme-treatment-success-with-chinese-medicine), or \"Gu syndrome.\" This classification covers illnesses caused by \"invisible\" pathogens, like viruses, funguses, and parasites. Along with the toxins from the tick bite, we consider how pathogens like heat, wind, and dampness all play a role in the illness. According to TCM theory, extreme heat in the body is also considered \"toxic.\" This category of condition helps us understand a variety of different systemic inflammatory illnesses, and gives us a framework for addressing each individual's presenting symptoms. One of the key features of Gu syndrome illnesses is how terrible and hopeless they can make people feel. Not only do people suffering from chronic inflammatory or immune-related conditions feel constantly tired and ache-y, but some of the sensations seem to come and go and feel so mysterious that they can't be explained satisfactorily. If this is then compounded with the fact that many doctors don't understand or know how to deal with the illness, it can leave patients feeling very frustrated and helpless. After months or years of this, debilitating physical symptoms may be accompanied by feelings of [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). A Yale Medical University [study of patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012507/), all in their 40s, suffering from long-term Lyme complications found that they had to reduce their activities, or even give up working, and doubted that they would ever recover. In interviews, patients made it clear that working with doctors who were more holistic was far preferred, and thus many had turned to CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) providers for help with Lyme disease. Making a full recovery from long-term Lyme disease is possible, but it can take a long time to get rid of a bacterial infection that has woven itself deeply into the body's organ systems. The benefit of Chinese herbal medicine for Lyme is that the powerful substances in the herbs can penetrate deep into the body at a cellular level. Working with an experienced acupuncturist means that your [Chinese herbs for Lyme disease](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/digital/index.php?i=739&a_id=33707&pn=44&r=t&Page=44) can be regularly updated, according to your individual needs, as you progress. This, in combination with acupuncture treatment for Lyme disease, moxibustion, and nutrition guidelines for an anti-inflammatory diet can all help patients feel better faster and prevent any further damage to the organs and the nervous system. Our [TCM detox program](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-detox-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) may also be helpful. Top 5 Tips for Lyme Disease Self-Care Sometimes re-prioritizing health over all else is necessary in order to heal from a serious infectious disease. - Conserve energy. Rest as much as possible. - Drink extra water. - Eliminate coffee, alcohol, spicy foods, chips, roasted nuts, any food that adds heat and inflames further. Try to reduce heat. - Eat more cooling foods. Mung bean tea is an ideal choice. - In the later stages of the disease, we may need to add more strengthening foods, like chicken stock and soup, and will recommend different herbal formulae, as well. Overall, reducing stress and finding a meditation practice is helpful. For more detailed instructions on how to eat right to reduce inflammation, [ see our article](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) specifically addressing anti-inflammatory food and lifestyle choices. Acupuncture Near Me for Lyme Disease Dealing with a complicated illness like Lyme disease is challenging for people and doctors. A long process of discovery and commitment may be necessary. Working with an experienced TCM provider gives patients the benefits of a multi-pronged, holistic way of addressing multiple symptoms, both physical and emotional. Acupuncture for infectious diseases like Lyme takes into account each patient's individual concerns, and addresses the complex symptoms of Lyme in concert. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat High Blood Pressure With Acupuncture & TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Ph.D. What is high blood pressure? Blood pressure (BP) is the force with which blood, pumped by the heart, pushes against the inner walls of the arteries and veins. When this force is consistently high, it puts a strain on the delicate tissues of the blood vessels and makes your heart work harder. This is also called hypertension. Most people take medications to control high blood pressure. In this article we'll discuss [how to manage high blood pressure with TCM and acupuncture.](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2015/04/23/lower-your-blood-pressure-extend-your-life#:~:text=For%20hypertension%2C%20there%20are%20acupoints,is%20directly%20related%20to%20stress.) [High blood pressure](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/high-blood-pressure) is very common in older adults; about half of people over the age of 60 have high blood pressure. It is very important to have your doctor regularly monitor your blood pressure, because high blood pressure, if left untreated, can lead to heart disease, [arrhythmia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), heart attack, [ stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), kidney disease, and many other serious, life-threatening conditions. Your blood pressure reading is made up of two parts: systolic, which measures the force of blood being pumped away from the heart, and diastolic, the force of blood moving in between heart beats, when blood is flowing back into the heart. A [normal blood pressure](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/what-is-high-blood-pressure) reading is usually considered 120/80 (systolic over diastolic). A consistent reading of BP over 130 would indicate hypertension stage 1, while a BP over 140 would be classified as hypertension stage 2. A BP over 180 signals a hypertensive crisis, and should be treated as an emergency, as it could lead to a stroke or other serious organ failure. People with [ high blood pressure](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/about.htm) are advised to make lifestyle changes, including following a healthier diet, getting more exercise, and quitting smoking. Even a modest weight loss of ten pounds or so can make a big difference to reduce high blood pressure. Most people end up taking antihypertensive medications to [lower blood pressure](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/high-blood-pressure/high-blood-pressure), often for the rest of their lives. Integrative care for high blood pressure that includes acupuncture treatment and herbal supplements according to TCM principles can provide natural remedies for high blood pressure, restoring the health of the circulatory system so that it might not be necessary to take drugs indefinitely. Signs of High Blood Pressure In many cases, there are no clear signs that a person has [high blood pressure](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/why-high-blood-pressure-is-a-silent-killer/what-are-the-symptoms-of-high-blood-pressure). Most people do not realize they have high blood pressure until it is measured by a medical professional. While people may think that a flushed, red face, or bouts of [dizziness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423284/) are symptoms of high blood pressure, these sorts of signals are not necessarily directly caused by high blood pressure. A flushed face caused by dilated blood vessels can happen for many reasons, usually because of a temporary rise in blood pressure due to heat, or cold weather, physical activity, spicy foods, hot drinks or alcohol, or a reaction to cosmetic skin products. [Dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can actually be related to the side effects of medications prescribed for high blood pressure. The only way to know for sure is to check your blood pressure. Many older people, especially women, with high blood pressure, experience bouts of dizziness that may be part of a hypertensive crisis - a sudden increase in blood pressure that can cause temporary dizziness or vertigo, [ tinnitus (ringing in the ears)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), or headache. A hypertensive emergency is sometimes the reason that a person visits a doctor to have a blood pressure check. It may be that hypertension has an effect on the peripheral auditory and vestibular systems, which can affect a person's sense of equilibrium and orientation in space. High blood pressure can also contribute to [problems with memory or cognitive function](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Top 10 Causes of High Blood Pressure Many factors can lead to high blood pressure. Aging is one factor. If there is a family history of hypertension, you may be genetically predisposed to having high blood pressure, too. Other risk factors also increase the chances of high blood pressure: [Smoking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Diet high in salt and/or fat - Lack of exercise, sedentary lifestyle - Being overweight - Stress - Too much alcohol consumption [Sleep apnea, snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Thyroid and adrenal problems - Kidney problems - Diabetes Medical diagnosis and treatment for high blood pressure don't really focus on finding a root cause of the problem. General guidelines for eating less salt and fat, losing weight, and finding [ways to reduce stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) may help people reduce high blood pressure, but for most people, modest lifestyle modifications aren't enough to solve the problem. High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy Some women develop [high blood pressure during pregnancy](https://www.acog.org/patient-resources/faqs/pregnancy/preeclampsia-and-high-blood-pressure-during-pregnancy). Called gestational hypertension, this occurs when a woman has elevated blood pressure during the last 20 weeks of pregnancy. While this type of high blood pressure usually goes away after birth, it can be an indicator of becoming hypertensive later in life. In some cases, having high blood pressure while pregnant can cause problems, such as fetal growth restriction, which may happen if not enough nutrients are being carried to the growing fetus through the blood vessels. If high blood pressure and high levels of protein in the urine are both detected, a woman may have preeclampsia, a serious problem that is believed to be caused by restricted blood flow to the placenta. Women with high blood pressure during pregnancy are more likely to experience preterm birth and to have unplanned delivery Caesarean section. Conventional treatment for gestational hypertension typically involves monitoring and managing high blood pressure with medications. While not many clinical studies have been done regarding acupuncture treatment for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, TCM has been used to treat high blood pressure and complications of pregnancy for thousands of years. From the TCM point of view, high blood pressure during pregnancy may be due to a deficiency of Liver and/or Kidney Yin, or rising Liver Yang energy in response to a Kidney Yin Deficiency, or Blood or Yin Deficiency. A TCM provider would use diagnostic methods to determine the differentiation and use acupuncture points to nourish the appropriate organs, promote better flow of Blood and Qi, and to [ help alleviate stress](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/). How to Control Blood Pressure with Acupuncture and TCM Naturally, for many centuries, TCM practitioners had no way of measuring blood pressure with medical devices. They depended on observations of people's symptoms, appearance, and careful checking of the pulse by hand. Thus, [TCM does take into consideration](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijhy/2019/8676490/) the patient's feelings and experience of symptoms of high blood pressure like: - Dizziness or vertigo [Palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Headache [Fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Shortness of breath - Weakness in the knees - Memory loss - Vision loss [TCM views](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/284847/) dizziness as being a result of too much Liver Yang energy, stagnant Phlegm, Liver-Kidney deficiency, and deficiency or stagnation of Blood and Qi. Hypertension type headaches are caused by the addition of Fire energy coming from the stomach or intestine. Liver Fire can cause irritability and flushing in the face, while Heart Fire can cause chest distress, nervousness, and [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/). Weakness and fatigue would be caused by the addition of Dampness and accumulated excess fluid. Fluid retention can lead to a distended abdomen, edema, and [low back pain](https://myartofwellness.com/tcm-low-back-pain/). TCM philosophy also takes into consideration the emotional state as it relates to the physical health of the body. More recent scientific research also confirms that [feelings of anger stimulate the sympathetic nervous system](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32756) and contribute to high blood pressure and heart disease. Finding practices that help how to control anger and find calm are another important part of managing high blood pressure. A TCM practitioner can treat all of these various symptoms with a combination of acupuncture treatment and herbal supplements individually customized for each patient's specific circumstance. [One randomized study](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=31553) compared patients receiving acupuncture versus patients receiving sham acupuncture to treat hypertension over a six-week period. The patients who had real treatments showed significantly lower daytime and nighttime blood pressure readings. [Another study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23724695/) showed that acupuncture treatment given to patients in conjunction with antihypertensive medications showed significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic BP readings. As the results of [this research study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516840/) of many clinical trials concluded, regular acupuncture treatments have the effect of reducing blood pressure, with the effects lasting several days after each treatment. Acupuncture treatment generally has a cumulative effect, and it is necessary to stick with it to get results. It is also crucial that you work with your healthcare practitioner to determine which dietary changes and forms of exercise will best help how to reduce high blood pressure. Acupuncture Near Me for High Blood Pressure Managing high blood pressure takes commitment to making long-term lifestyle changes and regular monitoring. Adding acupuncture and TCM to your integrative care regimen may help you reduce high blood pressure, improve related problems like fatigue, dizziness, and headache, and avoid more serious health problems down the line. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Carpal Tunnel Syndrome With Acupuncture & TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-with-acupuncture-tcm/) Do you keep dropping things? It could be carpal tunnel hand pain and weakness caused by a repetitive stress injury. [ Carpal Tunnel Syndrome](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/) is a condition caused by an impingement of the median nerve, which travels through the wrist joint to give sensation to the hand and fingers. When this nerve is compressed, there may be pain or numbness in the fingers and hand. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome often gets worse as time goes on. It is important to seek out treatment for carpal tunnel to help reverse the progression of the problem. Carpal tunnel is the most common form of [peripheral neuropathy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) in the United States, affecting over eight million people per year. Almost a quarter of a million people undergo surgery to try to correct carpal tunnel syndrome annually. Carpal tunnel affects women more often than men, and unfortunately can cause disability, making it difficult or impossible for people to continue their work. [ Acupuncture treatment combined with Chinese herbal remedies has been shown to significantly reduce the tingling pain in fingers and weakness of the hands caused by carpal tunnel syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3523426). Do I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a type of compression mononeuropathy, in which damage to a single nerve causes pain, numbness, and weakness of a particular part of the body: in this case, the wrist, hand, and fingers. Carpal Tunnel can also cause neck and shoulder pain and various types of headaches. While pain and tingling in the fingers are the most common signs of [carpal tunnel](https://www.sports-health.com/sports-injuries/hand-and-wrist-injuries/my-hand-and-wrist-pain-caused-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-or), it is also true that several other neurological conditions can cause pain and numbness in the hands. Compression of one of the nerves travelling through the cervical spine can also affect the hands. Impingement of the ulnar nerve, which travels down the arm and alongside the elbow (the \"funny bone\"), is known as cubital tunnel syndrome, and can also cause tingling in the fingers. The difference here is that usually carpal tunnel causes the sensations in the thumb, index and middle fingers, while cubital tunnel causes numbness or pain in the ring and pinky fingers. Thoracic outlet syndrome, which causes impingement of nerves between the collarbone and upper ribs, and Reynaud's phenomenon, which causes restriction of blood flow through the blood vessels of the extremities, are rarer conditions which can also cause numbness in the fingers. Top 5 Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel: - Tingling and numbness in the hand and fingers, especially the thumb, index, and ring fingers. May feel like a burning sensation, or occasional short \"shocks\" - Weakness of the hand, tendency to drop objects - Wrist pain, hand pain, and [pain in the forearm](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tennis-elbow-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Fingers feel swollen, even if they don't appear puffy - Tingling that travels up the arm, neck and shoulder pain [Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Carpal-Tunnel-Syndrome-Fact-sheet) usually begin subtly and develop gradually over time. Often people first notice some tingling or a sense that the fingers are swollen, especially at night. You might feel the urge to \"shake out\" your hands and wrists when you get up. As carpal tunnel becomes more serious, people will start to feel weakness in their hands as they go about their daily activities. In extreme cases, people with carpal tunnel may lose muscle mass in their thumb pad area, or cease to be able to sense hot or cold with their hands, which puts them at risk for burning themselves. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Migraines [Recent research](https://headaches.org/2015/05/04/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-associated-with-migraine/) has suggested that there may be a [link between carpal tunnel and migraine headaches](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387155/). A study found that people with carpal tunnel were two times as likely to also suffer from migraines, and that people with migraines were twice as likely to also have symptoms of carpal tunnel. This information may help medical professionals learn more about migraine, which remains a mysterious condition, and has not been traditionally viewed as a problem with nerve compression. While conventional medicine still has limited understanding of [migraine, acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) is an effective modality for [headache relief](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). A TCM practitioner can help headache, wrist pain, hand pain, [neck](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/), all simultaneously, without any negative side effects. Carpal Tunnel Causes and Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Repetitive movements that cause inflammation in the wrist joint are the primary causes of carpal tunnel syndrome. This kind of repetitive stress injury occurs when you perform the same motions with the wrist and hand over and over, as when working with tools or assembly, chopping with a knife, playing an instrument, or typing on a keyboard. When you seek treatment for carpal tunnel, diagnostic testing will first be done to determine exactly what bones, nerves, muscles, or tendons might be causing symptoms of pain and tingling. [Diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can also be a cause of mononeuropathies like carpal tunnel. The first treatment for carpal tunnel usually involves some immobilization of the wrist (with a wrist splint or brace) and anti-inflammatory medications or injections. If the condition does not improve after reduction and modification of the repetitive motions that were causing carpal tunnel symptoms, then a specialist may recommend surgery. Electroscopic procedures may make small incisions in the tendon of the wrist to relieve pressure on the median nerve. Early treatment of carpal tunnel is crucial for preventing further damage to the median nerve. Addressing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome as soon as possible with alternative modalities such as acupuncture and therapeutic tui na massage can help restore full function of the nerves and the mobility and strength of the hands and fingers. How Acupuncture Helps Carpal Tunnel Traditional Chinese Medicine uses a combination of therapies to address conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome. Acupuncture treatment works on the principle that pain and loss of mobility in the body is often due to blocked energy (Qi) along the meridians (energy pathways) of the body. Acupuncture treatment combined with herbal supplementation can [reduce inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1781596/) and help with the [regeneration of nerve](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0192415X01000393) and other tissues. According to TCM theory, carpal tunnel syndrome is usually attributed to \"wind\" or cold invading the muscles and ligaments, along with Qi and/or blood stasis causing blockages. [One study](https://www.nccaom.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Acupuncture%20Stops%20Carpal%20Tunnel%20Wrist%20Pain,%20Restores%20Dexterity.pdf) showed that acupuncture treatment combined with a topical herbal treatment reduced pain in 90% and improved wrist function in 85% of the participants. [Another study](https://time.com/4690200/acupuncture-carpal-tunnel-syndrome/) in an American hospital, aimed at proving scientifically the unknown ways in which acupuncture works, used electrodes to show how treatment affected nerve impulses and produced changes in the somatosensory cortex. This study objectively quantified that acupuncture improved the conductivity of nerves in the wrist and effected changes in the brain deemed related to their carpal tunnel syndrome. Top 5 Tips for Carpal Tunnel Relief Here are some carpal tunnel exercises and acupressure points for carpal tunnel that you can practice to help prevent carpal tunnel and relieve carpal tunnel symptoms. - Your doctor may recommend nerve gliding exercises, sometimes called nerve flossing or neural gliding. These gentle exercises are designed to help facilitate the smooth movement of the tendon through the carpal tunnel of the wrist bones, so as to alleviate pressure and inflammation of the median nerve. - Using acupressure points for carpal tunnel can help relieve symptoms. Try applying firm pressure to PC6 Nei Guan, located on the inner arm, three finger-widths below the wrist. - Be especially mindful when you are performing repetitive tasks with your hands. Take frequent breaks to stretch and rub your wrists. - Pay attention to your sleep position. Avoid putting pressure on your wrists or holding them in a bent position during the night. Elevate your hands and wrists if possible. - Keep your hands and wrists warm. Wear gloves whenever appropriate to the temperature in your environment. Keep a cup of hot tea nearby while you work, to warm your hands. Acupuncture Near Me for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Carpal Tunnel tends to worsen over time as we age and continue to engage in repetitive movements through our daily activities. If you or someone you know is experiencing tingling in the fingers, hand pain, or wrist pain-or even having migraine headaches or neck and shoulder pain that may seem unrelated-it is important to address it promptly. Integrative care combining conventional medicine and acupuncture treatment for carpal tunnel can help to reduce hand pain, numbness in the fingers, and weakness in the wrist.

[ How to Treat Migraine with TCM and Acupuncture ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) Tan, [Migraine](https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/what-is-migraine/) a disorder that affects about 10% of people worldwide; women are three times more likely to suffer migraine headaches than men. A migraine is an intense headache that lasts anywhere from several hours to three days and is severe enough to impede normal activities. The throbbing, pulsating, or stabbing pain in the head typical of a migraine is usually accompanied by a variety of other symptoms, including nausea and increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Migraines develop in stages over several hours or days, and the exact nature of the experience differs widely from person to person. Migraine is a recurrent condition, and patients are typically diagnosed with migraine if they have experienced at least five of these types of headaches in their lifetime. Some people suffer from chronic migraines that cause them to be debilitated several times per month. There are [different types of headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), but migraine headaches are distinct from [tension headaches, sinusitis headaches, and cluster headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/its-all-in-your-head-headaches-and-tcm/) in key ways. Although much [research](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Migraine-Information-Page) has been done, the physiological processes that cause migraines are still not completely understood. There is no cure for migraines, and treatment methods focus on preventing migraines from beginning or fully developing, and alleviating the symptoms until the attack abates. While more research is needed to demonstrate exactly how acupuncture impacts brain chemistry, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5931197/) have made it clear that TCM methods and [acupuncture treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) are an effective alternative for relieving migraine. What Causes Migraine? Current medical theory generally attributes migraines to [abnormal neurological functions](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/headache/how-a-migraine-happens) in the brain cells. This may be due to genetics, as susceptibility to migraines does tend to run in families, especially from mothers to daughters. A cascade of chemical activity, possibly caused by fluctuations in hormones, causes the blood vessels to constrict, which leads to the pressure in head, throbbing pain and elevated nerve sensations. Migraines have also been linked to [carpal tunnel syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-with-acupuncture-tcm/), a nerve condition in which the median nerve is compressed. [TMJ, or disorders of the jaw](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), can also contribute to migraines. [Meniere's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), an inner ear problem that causes vertigo, dizziness, ringing in the ears, and nausea, has also been linked to migraines. [Occipital neuralgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-occipital-neuralgia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), which occurs when the occipital nerves are compressed or irritated, can cause migraine-like pain in the back of head and neck. Stages and Symptoms of Migraine Migraines do not simply cause a severe headache. Migraine episodes go through a [pattern of stages](https://www.migrainetrust.org/about-migraine/migraine-what-is-it/symptoms-and-stages/), during which a variety of symptoms come and go. While a person may not be able to predict when a migraine will come on, once he or she is familiar with [these stages](https://migraine.com/migraine-basics/migraine-phases/), the course of the migraine attack is somewhat predictable. [Premonitory](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30074545/)or Prodrome Stage of Migraine - In the early part of the migraine, a person might experience physical signs such as stiffness in the neck (cervicogenic headache), especially on one side, frequent yawning, cravings for certain foods, marked thirstiness, and increased urination. Emotionally and mentally, a sense of fatigue, irritability, depression, or confusion might pervade. Some people feel hyperactive or even euphoric. This period can last for hours or days. - Aura - Not everyone who has migraines experiences what is known as the Aura phase, which produces unusual sensory distortions. In other cases, people may experience the Aura phase, but not the subsequent headache pain phase. Some examples of migraine with aura symptomology include: Allodynia (hypersensitivity to touch, so much that it is painful), [Metamorphopsia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23957288/)- a profound change in perception of the size of objects, including one's own body, altered spatial awareness, Aphasia - impairment in the language center of the brain that causes forgetting words, feeling generally unable to express oneself verbally, Visual - seeing wavy lines or flashing lights (phosphenes), \"blind spots\" or reduced field of vision (scotoma), Auditory - loss of hearing, auditory hallucinations, Headache and [dizziness or vertigo](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Headache - Some people may have only mild pain during this phase, and therefore do not recognize they are having a migraine. Many migraine sufferers, however, experience severe throbbing headache, sharp pain in head, or stabbing pain (ice pick headache), often on one side of the head, headache back of head, headache behind eyes, or in the temples on head. The pain is usually worse if one is active. Heightened sensitivity to light, sounds, and smells are common, and people usually feel like retreating to a dark, quiet room to lie down. During this phase, people may also experience nausea and/or vomiting, dehydration, dizziness, hot flashes and/or chills, and strong emotions such as anxiety, fear, and depression. This phase can last anywhere from several hours to three days. - Postdrome - The final phase of migraine is sometimes likened to a \"hangover.\" People generally feel low energy and low mood, as well as fatigue and compromised cognitive function. This phase, too, can last several hours to a few days. Migraine episodes have a devastating impact on people's ability to function normally. More than half of migraine sufferers miss at least two days of work per month, and many more try to get through their workdays even though they are in the middle of a migraine. Are [Migraines Related to Hormones](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-daily-headaches/in-depth/headaches/art-20046729)? While anyone can have migraines, [women are three times more likely](https://migraineresearchfoundation.org/about-migraine/migraine-in-women/) to experience them, especially during their reproductive years. Many women perceive their migraine to be a [PMS headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or period headache, because it occurs prior to or during the menstrual period. These types of migraine can be particularly debilitating. The cause of headache is believed to be due to a sudden drop in estrogen. This same mechanism can cause frequent headaches during perimenopause or early menopause due to fluctuations in estrogen levels. Sometimes women are prescribed the use of continual oral contraceptive medication (i.e., skipping the placebo week of pills) in order to prevent drops in estrogen that may be causing migraine. This treatment does not work for everyone, though, and obviously is not helpful for women who may wish to get pregnant. [Serotonin levels have also been linked to migraine](https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-016-0711-0). Research has shown that fluctuations in neurotransmitters and vascular functions in the brain are part of the migraine pathology, but it remains unclear exactly how this plays out. Triptans, drugs which act upon the [serotonin](https://www.medscape.com/answers/1179268-119789/what-is-the-role-of-serotonin-in-the-pathogenesis-of-migraine) receptors in the brain, are currently the most common treatment for acute migraine, as in some cases, they will stop a migraine attack from progressing. These medications do not work for everyone, though, and they cause constriction of blood vessels, which can lead to other problems, such as tightness, tingling, and hot flushes in various parts of the body. Targeting the production and function of one of two specific hormones may produce some positive results, but as migraines appear to stem from a complex combination of hormonal, vascular, and metabolic malfunctions, a more holistic approach may be indicated. [Acupuncture has been shown](http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-REST200905007.htm) to help regulate hormones like estrogen and serotonin, specifically, but TCM achieves those results by observing and treating the whole person, emotionally, mentally, and physically; not only focusing on one or two isolated chemicals. Acupuncture and TCM for Migraine Help TCM theory is based on the concept of Qi as a life force energy which flows through the body along channels called meridians. Qi and blood move through these channels, several of which meet in the head. Blockages and stagnation in one organ system can impact other organ systems. Recurrent migraines are considered to be caused by stasis and deficiencies in the liver, spleen, and kidney, which cause yang energy from the liver to rise to the head. Overconsumption of the wrong kinds of foods can cause phlegm build-up in these organs, while alcohol and pungent foods can create excess heat energy. A typical [TCM treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291665/) protocol might involve using specific acupuncture points and herbs to quench liver fire and eliminate phlegm. [Acupuncture can work on migraine pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3921614/) with its natural analgesic effects, while also helping to prevent future attacks by resolving these deeper organ system imbalances. [One study](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=27706) showed that migraine patients given acupuncture treatment experienced fewer episodes and missed fewer days of work than those given medications. The results also indicated that acupuncture was more cost effective than the medications. [A review of randomized trials](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001218.pub2/abstract) involving thousands of patients concluded that acupuncture is effective at reducing the number of days lost to migraines and should be considered a valuable treatment option. Top 5 Home Remedies for Migraine Headaches Migraines appear to be triggered by various stressors, lack of sleep, and certain foods. Aside from seeking acupuncture near me for migraine, there are several things you can do to prevent and relieve severe headaches. Natural remedies for migraines involve simple dietary, exercise and lifestyle modifications. - Avoid foods that can trigger migraines. The most common ones are processed or prepared foods with added nitrates or MSG. Dairy products, especially very salty or aged cheeses, and chocolate should be avoided if you are susceptible to migraine, as well as extremely cold drinks and desserts. Dried foods like fruits and beans, and pickled foods can also be problematic. - Emphasize foods high in magnesium, especially nuts, seeds, and high quality eggs. [Ginger](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23657930/)is known to relieve nausea and vomiting, and may alleviate other effects of migraine. One study showed that ginger was just as effective as Sumatriptan for decreasing symptoms of migraine. We recommend simply slicing fresh ginger root and steeping it in hot water to drink as a tea. - Try essential oils like lavender or peppermint. Rubbing a little bit into the temples can be soothing. - Find a gentle practice that combines breathing, movement, and meditation. [Yoga, particularly restorative yoga, has been shown](https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/yoga-helps-headache/)to be helpful for headaches. This may be because it helps people relax more fully. It also encourages better symmetry between the right and left sides of the body and brain.

[ How to Treat Headaches with Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) by Qineng Tan L.Ac., Ph.D. and Xiaomei Cai L.Ac., Ph.D. Headaches are extremely common. Virtually everyone gets a headache occasionally. But many people experience chronic and/or severe headaches that regularly disrupt their lives. With [acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/) and TCM, it is possible to get to the root cause of your headache without relying on pain medications that only mask the problem and can cause side effects. [The first U.S. survey](https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1526-4610.1998.3807497.x) study to examine the prevalence of different types of headaches showed that about 4% of the general population suffers from chronic headaches (defined as experiencing headaches about 180 days per year - or half the time). Half of those surveyed demonstrated characteristics of tension-type headaches, while roughly a third met the criteria for migraines. In fact, headaches are one of the conditions most commonly seen in acupuncture clinics today. TCM doctors using [acupuncture can offer relief headache](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/acupuncture-for-headache-2018012513146) without the side effects that prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause. Headaches that can be treated with acupuncture include [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), tension headaches, headaches occurring around the menstrual cycle, sinus headaches and stress-related headaches. In this article, we will analyze the various types of headaches and their causes, discuss how they can be treated with acupuncture and TCM, demonstrate scientific evidence of the efficacy of those treatments, and offer some great tips for how you can prevent and manage headache pain with lifestyle modifications. Seven Types of Headaches When treating with acupuncture, headaches are often classified by their location. This is only a broad guideline which needs to be further refined and integrated into the treatment for each individual, but this shows meridians and patterns that affect each area of the head. - Top of Head: liver Meridian (Liver Blood Deficiency, Liver yang Rising) - Sides of Head: Gall-Bladder Meridian (Liver-yang, Liver-Fire or Liver wind Rising) - One Side Only: Gall-Bladder Meridian (Liver-Yang or Liver-Fire Rising) - Temples: Gall-Bladder Meridian (Liver-Yang, Liver-Fire or Liver Wind Rising) - Behind the Eyes: Liver Meridian (Liver Blood Deficiency, Liver Yang Rising) - Forehead: Stomach Meridian (Stomach Deficiency or Stomach-Heat) - Whole Head: Kidney-Essence Deficiency or External Wind Many variables are taken into consideration in order to properly diagnose and successfully treat headaches. Each individual is treated differently depending on their unique symptoms. Some of the factors that will determine what acupuncture points and other treatment techniques are used include: what triggers the headache; the location, frequency and intensity of the headaches; the quality of the pain; the time of day that they occur, what helps the headaches and what makes them worse. What Causes a Headache? A patient's answers to the questions above help the TCM practitioner decide whether the headache stems from internal factors-such as emotions, hormone imbalance, [PMS,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) lack of sleep or nutrition-or from external factors-such as toxins in the environment, pinching in the neck due to pillow positioning, or [TMJ tension in the jaw](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). [Occipital headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-occipital-neuralgia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) occur when the occipital nerves in the back of the head and neck are irritated. The presenting symptoms, quality and location of the pain, also help to clarify whether there is a deficiency (tiredness) or an excess (feelings of anger). Often, there is a combination of various contributing factors, and the practitioner tailors the treatment to address them in concert. Acupuncture and TCM Herbs for Headaches Once the practitioner has determined the root causes of the headache, she will choose a combination of [points to stimulate with acupuncture treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/). Many migraine headaches are associated with the liver, for example, so points might be chosen to cool yang fire in the liver. Tension-type headaches may be related to tension in the neck and shoulders, so the acupuncturist will work to release blockages in those areas. Usually, patients are encouraged to get two treatments per week for eight weeks. Systematic reviews published by Cochrane in which the results of several scientific trials were consolidated demonstrate that acupuncture is an effective treatment for prevention and relief of both [ tension-type headaches](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007587/SYMPT_acupuncture-tension-type-headache) and [migraines](https://www.cochrane.org/CD001218/SYMPT_acupuncture-preventing-migraine-attacks). They showed that patients receiving acupuncture treatment had on average about half as many headaches as those patients not receiving acupuncture. The results were also long-term, lasting for months beyond the cycle of treatment. In addition to acupuncture treatment, the practitioner will likely recommend an [ herbal](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine/) formulation that will address the patient's specific needs. The daily use of the herb formula works to regulate the qi, balance yin and yang energies in the body, clear blockages and disperse stagnation. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4484556/) have shown that consistent use of herbs over a period of several weeks can help significantly reduce headache pain. Eight Self-Care Practices for Headache Prevention Healthy habits can help prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. Focus on what you can do to \"get ahead\" of your headaches. - Nutrition - Eat meals and snacks at regular times (every 3 hours or so) to maintain steady blood sugar levels. Avoid foods and drinks that are known to trigger headache attacks, including: processed meats, aged cheese, alcohol, and items sweetened with aspartame. Dehydration is a common cause of headaches; be sure to drink plenty of pure water throughout the day in addition to other liquids. - Sleep - Establish and maintain a regular sleeping schedule - rising and retiring at about the same time each day - including weekends and vacations. Sleep needs vary from person to person; figure out how much is optimal for you, and then strive for that nightly. - Stress - Stress is one of the most common headache and migraine triggers. Incorporate stress reduction techniques into your daily life. Set firm boundaries about taking on extra commitments, set aside time for meditation or other quiet activities that help you unwind and focus, such as knitting, reading, cooking - whatever brings you peace. Avoid screen time in the hour or two before bed, and establish a grounding morning routine that you practice before looking at email and rushing to get somewhere. - Activity - Cardiovascular exercise stimulates the body to release endorphins, which are brain chemicals that improve mood and relieve stress. Walking or hiking in nature is a great choice. Gentle stretching exercises such as yoga can help you become aware of tensions and release them. Massage is also helpful. - Acupressure points -For tension type headaches, try a pressure point called \"Large Intestine 4.\" This point is located between the thumb and forefinger. Apply firm pressure, squeezing deeply into the webbing there. - Headache Diary - Keep a diary of when your headaches occur, along with any triggers, and share the information with your healthcare provider. - See your healthcare provider - Make an appointment with your healthcare provider to specifically discuss your headache. - Be a partner in your headache care - Be informed, be a participant in your treatment and be an advocate for your headache care. Don't let chronic headaches keep interfering with your life. Talk to your TCM provider, and get started on a treatment regimen that will help you live more days headache-free.
