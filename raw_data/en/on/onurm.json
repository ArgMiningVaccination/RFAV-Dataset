Naturopathic Medicine is a unique and distinct system of health care that emphasizes the use of prevention and natural, non-invasive therapeutics including clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, hydrotherapy, physical medicine, and counseling. Naturopathic therapies can be used to complement treatments used by conventionally trained medical doctors. The result is a patient-centered approach that strives to provide the most appropriate treatment for an individual's needs. "}
