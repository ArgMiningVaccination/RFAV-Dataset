Th e study was conducted as part of the Livestock for Health (L4H) project. This project investigates the cost- effectiveness of livestock feeding and nutritional counselling during critical dry periods in reducing the risk of acute malnutrition in children below 5 years of age and in pregnant and lactating women (PLW). The L4H project is based on the observed patterns of increased acute malnutrition, associated with decreased milk consumption, among women and children in pastoralist communities. The study used a mixed methods approach to collect data from the two main communities (Rendille and Samburu) residing in Laisamis subcounty . The three methods used were key informant interviews, focus group discussions and participatory epidemiology methods. The aim of the study was to understand the communities' livelihood patterns and strategies, the observed temporal patterns of acute malnutrition in children and women, the factors determining the malnutrition patterns, and communities' perspectives on practices and programming used to minimize malnutrition in the community. Using the three data collection methods and gathering information from men and women from each of the two communities separately, the following were the key findings. Key findings Wealth status The two communities categorized household wealth status into one of three groups: rich, middle and poor. Using the proportional piling median scores obtained from men and women from the two communities, the poor comprised the largest group (50 to 62 percent), the middle wealth group were fewer (17 to 32 percent), while the rich comprised the smallest group (15 to 22 percent). The rich owned the most livestock (> 100 camels and > 100 cattle, > 200 goats and sheep and a few donkeys among the Rendille community; nearly 100 camels, > 300 cattle and > 300 goats and sheep among the Samburu community). The group categorized as poor among the Rendille community owned 1 -3 camels, 0-2 cattle, 10 goats, 10 sheep and 1 donkey. Among the Samburu community, those categoriz ed as poor rarely owned camels and had 0 -5 cattle, 2 -10 goats and sheep , and 0 -2 donkeys. Livelihood strategies The main source of livelihood for the rich group was livestock (48 to 56 percent), followed by business (26 to 29 percent) and remittance from t heir educated children living elsewhere (12 to 24 percent). The middle wealth group's main livelihood was livestock (70 to 77 percent for men and 35 to 36 percent for women in this group), followed by manual labour such as herding, construction and domestic work (23 to 30 percent for men and 64 to 65 percent for women). xiv The group classified as poor depended mainly on kinship support (41 to 60 percent for men and women), labour (24 to 43 percent) and relief (14 to 22 percent). The men herded camels, while women herded sheep and goats. Types and sources of food The main food types consumed in the two communities were animal-source foods (meat and milk), cereals, vegetables, beverages (mainly tea) and condiments. The relative composition of these food types in the household was associated with the wealth group the household belonged to. The main food constituent of the rich wealth group was animal-source foods (17 to 21 percent meat and 20 to 32 percent milk) across genders in the two communities. The pattern ch anged for the middle and poor wealth groups, who relied heavily on cereals (6 to 11 percent meat, 9 to 14 percent milk and 38 to 59 percent cereals for the poor wealth group). The poor relied on kinship goodwill and communal support to access milk and meat. Blood was mainly consumed during migration and in the dry season when food was scarce. During the wet season, when animals were grazing near the settlement areas, blood was provided mainly for pregnant women or those who were weak. Seasonality of undernutrition in children and pregnant and lactating women Malnutrition in children and PLW varied by season, with undernutrition prevalent during dry seasons. The long dry season runs from June to September/October, and the short dry season runs from January to February/March. The communities perceived the peaks of malnutrition as the months of July and August for the long dry season and February and March for the short dry season. The comparison of this community perception of malnutrition with the percentage of children with measures of middle upper arm circumference (MUAC) at less than < 135 mm shows similar patterns of when peaks of malnutrition occur. The peaks of community described malnutrition are inverse to the rainfall peaks. The peak in MUAC < 135 mm p ercentage measurements lags behind the peak in community described malnutrition and MUAC < 135 mm may remain low during the initial period of dry season until just about start of rains when they rise again. Causes of undernutrition The communities identified the causes of undernutrition in children as low intake of mother's milk and poor access to milk and meat from livestock. Undernutrition in PLW was described as mainly due to chronic hunger associated with low food supplies; poor access to nutritious ani mal-source feeds such as milk, blood and meat; and overworking. The main drivers of undernutrition identified were lack of livestock that provide milk; poverty and inability to purchase food, including milk and meat; asset ownership patterns that preclude women; drought leading to livestock migration away from the homestead; and diseases. Among children, the prevalence of diseases (common cold, diarrhoea, vomiting, pneumonia) was high xv during the dry cold season (July -August), whereas diarrhoea and malaria w ere observed more in the rainy season (March -April). Interventions to reduce risk of malnutrition The communities identified provision of Plumpy'Nut and nutrient -dense porridge as the main modern remedies for treating malnutrition. The current food intervention situation can be supported with a more sustainable support system that utilizes locally available resources, such as livestock. Establishing ways of returning livestock's utility function of providing highly nutritious milk, blood, ghee, meat and ani mal fat could improve the nutritional status of the chronically hungry communities. To achieve this, the productivity of livestock needs to be extended. From the findings of this study, camels would be ideal for milk, as both Rendille and Samburu communiti es have traditionally kept camels for milk. Sheep milk sells at a lower price in the market but is more nutrient dense and is consumed in homes more frequently than goat milk. Additional livestock could be introduced, like chickens, whose nutritional value to the household is unparalleled. However, some advocacy work would have to be part of the package to address the taboo that prohibits women from eating chicken and eggs. Nutrition programmes Program mes intervening in nutrition for children and PLW should build upon and take advantage of local coping strategies. For example, provision of fodder to the family milk camel to extend its lactation period into the long dry season would shorten the food shortage period that makes July and August the most dr eadful months of the year. Such interventions need to pay attention to the location of the milk animal, as communities in close proximity to urban centers may sell the milk to the rich. Milk must sell at a premium in the dry season. Proceeds from milk sales, if the milk is sold by women, are used to buy grain to feed the family, and the amount of grain sold is likely to feed more people than if they shared the milk. It might, therefore, be hepful if this milk is sold. However, such programme s should be conscious of the fact that women's commodities can change to men's commodities, and quickly, with commercialization. Once this happens, there is no guarantee that the proceeds of milk sales will be used for family and kin nutrition. \u00a9Washington State University/Thumbi Mwangi1 Introduction Malnutrition that is characterized by undernutrition is a global challenge, particularly in the pastoral areas of developing countries, where it mainly manifests itself in the form of underweight (low weight for age), stunting (too short for age) and wasti ng (low weight for certain height; Galgallo, 2017). Underpinning undernutrition is the maternal, infant and young children nutrition that is critical to both mother and child. Maternal nutrition is critical to the success of pregnancy and lactation, while infant and young child feeding practices are known to directly affect the nutritional status of children, ultimately impacting child survival (Opiyo, 2018). Previous studies have shown a generally higher prevalence of wasting and acute malnutrition in pastoral children than in agrarian populations with mixed livelihoods, where stunting and chronic malnutrition are more prevalent (Sadler et al., 2009; Catley et al., 2018). In Marsabit County, the prevalence of acute malnutrition expressed by global acute malnutrition (GAM) shows a trend far above the critical level of 15 percent in most years, particularly during the dry spells (SMART survey, National Drought Management Authority [NDMA], 2018; Wayua, 2017). The situation is worse in Laisamis subcounty , where GAM rates during dry spells ranged from 21.2 to 24.7 percent in the years 2015 to 2018 (SMART surveys, NDMA, 2017 and 2018). In the last four years, the integrated SMART survey reports for Marsabit County reported chronic malnutrition (stunting) figures ranging from 24.7 percent to 28.8 percent. Laisamis was one of the subcounties that recorded high stunting rates ranging from 25.9 percent to 37.9 percent over the same period (NDMA, 2017 and 2018). Over the years, the worsening cyclic droughts, insecurity (mainly livestock rustling among the various communities) and increasing population pressure in Marsabit County have contributed to reduced per capita livestock ownership and subsequently increased sedentarization of pastoralist dropouts. This has resulted in increased food poverty, culminating in a trend of increasing stunting and chronic malnutrition (Nyamori, 2002; Shell -Duncan and Yung, 2004). Although sedentarization may be intended to promote access to better health care and nutrition through market integration, it has resulted in economic stratification and rapid changes in food availability as well as food preference, among other changes (Adongo et al., 2012). Limited economic activities coupled with lack of employment opportunities drive the settled communities into poverty and desperation. Most of the pastoral dropouts would want to revert to a pastoral way of life, starting with small stock and even poultry, since livestock ownership is important for income, savings and maintaining people's identity. However, the level of destitution found amongst pastoral dropouts makes a return to pastoralism unlikely (Sandford and Ashley, 2008). This is because most dropouts sell whatever livestock resources are available to them in the market to generate income to buy cereal foods. A study by Mitchel (1999) records that the sedentary Ariaal women with few milch animals in Marsabit are driven to the market activity of selling the only household milk, which is not a surplus, to generate few earnings to pay for 2 maize meal, other household foods and medicines. It is thus noted that prevailing poverty in the settled household drives them to eat less nutritious food, since they choose to forgo milk to sell it in the market, a factor that may contribute to increased ch ronic malnutrition. Nyamori (2002) explains the difference between the settled households and semi -pastoralists of Laisamis and notes: Livestock holding in the semi -pastoral households is almost three times higher than in the settled households. While the settled households rely on market foods both in dry and wet seasons with a few milk supplements in the wet season, the semi -pastoral households rely on milk in both seasons, supplemented with a substantial amount of market foods in dry seasons. (p. 39) Seasonal changes in the pasture and access to water that are commensurate with the prevailing rainfall have had major implications for animal -source foods, especially milk for the pastoral communities in Marsabit. Generally, the drought early warning bulle tins for Marsabit from 2017 to date describe two seasonal rainfall and dry seasons which can be very erratic. In years such as 2005, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2017, the county experienced serious drought that seems to have been back to back. Most times, short rains are expected in the months of April and May, while the long rains start in October and end in December. The short dry season is in January to March, while the long dry season is in June through September. The peak dry season months are March and September. This seasonality of climatic events and livestock reliance on rain -fed pastures exposes the pastoral communities to the vagaries of nature. During the dry season there is less milk as the milch animals dry up and migrate away from the settlemen ts. Nyamori (2002) notes: During the dry season, 61 percent of Rendille semi -pastoral households in Marsabit have their food expenditure fall below the food poverty line while during the wet season, only 34 percent are food poor. The food poverty level s reduce by almost half and can be attributed to a substantial increase in milk supply, which is also easily accessible since livestock are within the main settlement. It is also important to note that semi - pastoral households are endowed with large per capita livestock holding and are therefore bound to receive higher supply than settled households. (p. 41 and 42) 3 It should be noted that the settled Rendille and Samburu pastoral dropouts who have low livestock holding per capita experience dire food poverty during the dry season, where up to 64 percent are food poor and only 5 percent get out of food poverty during the wet season, leaving 59 percent food poor (Nyamori, 2002). These observations reinforce the seasonality of food poverty and consequently th e accompanying malnutrition. This study sought to explore the malnutrition in Laisamis subcounty among the Rendille and Samburu communities. Objectives of the study The objectives of the study were as follows: 1. To understand livelihood strategies of the Rendille and Samburu pastoral communities of Laisamis subcounty of Marsabit County . 2. To understand the factors associated with malnutrition in children and women among the Rendille and Samburu of Laisamis subcounty of Marsabit County . 3. To understand the communities' perspectives on practices and programming used to minimize malnutrition. 4 Materials and methods Study sites Marsabit County profile Marsabit County occupies the extreme part of northern Kenya and lies b etween latitude 02\u00b0 45 ' and 04\u00b0 27' North and longitude 37\u00b0 57' and 39\u00b0 21' East. It borders Ethiopia to the north, Lake Turkana to the west, Samburu County to the south and Wajir and Isiolo counties to the east. The county covers an area of 70 961.2 km2. Marsabit County is divided into Sololo. Most parts of the county are arid, except for high rainfall areas around M ount Marsabit, Mount Kulal, Hurri Hills and the Moyale-Sololo escarpment. Rainfall in most parts is low, unreliable and unevenly distributed. The duration, amount and reliability of rainfall increase with altitude. The area below 700 m above sea level receives low and unreliable rainfall. Livestock keeping forms the main economic activity in the county, with many people owning cattle, goats, sheep, camels, donkeys, poultry and beehives. The main livestock products are milk, beef, mutton, chevon and camel meat. There are wildlife conservancies but no registered group or company ranches. However, different communities have their own grazing areas. Figure 1.

It has been observed that pastoral communities possess large bodies of indigenous knowledge on all spheres of their lives (i.e. livestock husbandry, diseases , environment, nutrition, human health) and how these factors are related or interact. This knowledge is gained over aeons of experience, and modern science can tap into this knowledge if appropriate data collection tools are applied in pastoral or rural c ommunities. Data collection tools that respect local culture, encourage participation and include respondents in telling their story will be most appropriate, particularly to the sections of pastoral communities without Western education. Such data collect ion methods include participatory rural appraisal, which has been used to gather agricultural data from rural communities, and participatory epidemiology (PE) methods that have been adapted from participatory rural appraisal for purposes of epidemiological data collection in livestock and public health. Over time, PE has been widely used by researchers, practitioners, government epidemiology units and international agencies such as the World Organi sation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (Catley et al., 2018). Definition of malnutrition Throughout this study, the definition of malnutrition (undernutrition) was on the bases of local community understanding of the condition and community members' description of malnutrition presentation in children and women. Through the initial discussions with the community during key informant interviews (KIIs), definitions of undernutrition developed by the community were as follows: Child malnutrition was associated with weakness due to prolonged lack of adequate food, insufficient quantities of mother's breast milk (i.e. prolonged and continuous hunger), wasting and loss of weight, and lack of playfulness. The child may develop a distended abdomen and lack of appetite and may be susceptible to intestinal worms and other diseases. PLW's malnutrition was described as prolonged lack of sufficient food and overwork, leading to weakness, wasting and thinness. The women may report experiencing dizziness and susceptibility to diseases. A comparison was made between Marsabit County's official malnutrition data for the past year and the malnutrition described by the community in the study. Primary data collection tools The study utilized quali tative mixed methods of data collection. KIIs were used to explore community issues relating to malnutrition. The PE interviews provided qualitative and semi -quantitative data on the seasonality and factors associated with malnutrition in children and PLW. Focus group discussions ( FGDs ) generated qualitative data on the communities' knowledge of malnutrition. 6 Focus group discussion and key informant interviews FGDs and KIIs were guided by checklists of open -ended questions that were pretested and adjusted prior to the start of the study. Participatory epidemiology interviews Similarly, a checklist of open -ended questions was developed for a PE exercise. The checklist was pretested and adjusted prior to the start of the study. Data collection adopted variou s PE methods such as semi -structured interviews, proportional piling and ranking. The FGDs were carried out with groups of six to eight informants representing a village. Semi -structured interviews were used mainly for general data collection and probing f or information on wealth indicators, wealth groups, livelihood activities, herd composition and livestock diseases. The simple ranking method was used to establish disease ranks based on disease incidence and impact on livestock benefits. The proportional piling method was used extensively in this study to generate proportions in establishing the relative sizes of wealth groups, livelihood analysis, herd composition and seasonality of factors associated with malnutrition. The PE methods used in each community were standardiz ed and successfully repea ted to produce ranks, scores or proportions, thereby creating data sets that could be analy sed statistically (Catley et al., 2018). Sampling unit and size The sampling design for the study was purposive sampling, where the study sites (villages) selected for qualitative data collection were based on key informant knowledge of the area. A total of 11 sites were selected purposively in Laisamis subcounty. Survey process Planning process To elaborate on the scope of the work for the malnutrition study, several meetings were held between the research consultants and the Washington State University (WSU) principal investigator. The first meeting was held with consultants and the principal investigator at WSU to lay the ground for the work and discuss administrative issues. A subsequent meeting held online over Zoom discussed the technical content of the study in detail. The other meetings were held in the field and included enumerator training. 7 Development of data collection tools and pretesting The two research consultants held a one-day meeting where they developed the data collection tools that included KII checklists, focus group checklists and PE checklists. Along with these tools, the databases for capturing data w ere also developed. Prior to the survey, the tools were pretested with enumerators in the target areas to determine whether the questions were applicable to the target areas and whether there were difficulties in administering the tools. Tools and database s were finalized after pretesting. Selection and training of survey personnel The general qualifications and competencies considered for the enumerators for the study were college education (certificate, diplomas or bachelor's degrees), previous experience in surveys and fluency in English and the indigenous languages. Prior to conducting the field study, the enumerators for both FGDs and PE study exercises were trained and assisted to practise data collection for one day. This helped equip the enumerators with skills for data collection. The research consultants comprehensively reviewed the checklists to harmonize enumerators understanding of the questions and expected responses. Field survey A total of 25 FGDs, 24 PE FGDs and 25 KIIs were conducted in the sites indicated below. The FGDs comprised women, men and, to the extent possible, the youth. The sites were Olturot, Kargi, Korr, Logologo, Laisamis, data from KIIs and FGDs was entered in data capture sheets. The data was grouped into similar themes and then analy sed. The cleaned PE data was analy sed on Megastat for MS Excel and s tatistical package for social science. Descriptive statistics such as percentages, median, ranking and ranges were analy sed and data visualization done. The data on PE was tested for agreement on responses made by participants. The statistical test used was the non-parametric Kendall's coefficient of concordance. 8 Results The results are presented along the three objectives of the study. One general observation was that there are no pure Samburu communities, but there is a bilingual Samburu -Rendille speaking community arising from intermarriages between Samburu and R endille - probably those referred to as Ariaal in literature. We, therefore, compared this bilingual Samburu group with the Rendille group. Objective 1 . To understand the livelihoods of the Rendille and Samburu communities of Marsabit 1.1. Wealth groups - characterization of wealth groups The key informants, discussants in PE and FGDs from the Rendille and the Samburu, characterized wealth groups mainly into three: rich, middle and poor. A small number of key informants characterized them into two groups, rich and poor. During the PE discussions, the Rendille men, particularly from the Kargi and Korr, identified the rich wealth group as Layore, the middle as Ntiskanola and the poor as Thoyore. Table 1.1.a. presents the various names given to each of the three groups by men and women from these two ethnicities. Table 1.1.a. Characterization of wea lth groups Rendille PE. To estimate the wealth status of different communities, focus group discussants were asked to estimate the ratios using the proportional piling exercise (Table 1.1.b.). A similar exercise was repeated using a participatory exercise. Table 1.1.b. represents the results of average proportions of the four analytical categori es from the FGD exercises. Table 1.1.c. shows the median relative proportions of the three wealth groups as scored by both women and men. 9 Results from FGDs show that across both genders from the two ethnic groups, the poor constituted most of the populatio n and ranged between 50 and 62 percent. These were followed by the middle wealth group, which ranged between 17 and 30 percent of the population. The rich constituted 15 to 21 percent of the population. The same trend was established by the PE, where the poor were the largest group, with a median proportion of 51 to 54 percent. The middle wealth group was found to be 25 to 32 percent, while the rich group was 15 to 22 percent. The Rendille male respondents were largely in agreement, with a significant Kenda ll's coefficient of concordance of W = 0.64. The Rendille - and Samburu - speaking women were strongly in agreement in their responses. Table 1.1.b.

The numbers are the median scores for each wealth group as scored by informants during the proportional piling. 1.2. Main livelihood strategies per wealth group It was established that the three wealth groups deploye d different livelihood strategies to subsist. The rich relied heavily on large herds of livestock, accounting for 48 to 56 percent of their livelihood. This was followed at a distant second by businesses that accounted for about 26 to 29 percent of their livelihood. The rich people educate some of their children, who later contribute remittances to their household. According to women in both communities, the middle wealth group depend mainly on manual labour (herders, construction, domestic workers, etc.) at 64 percent, while men considered the middle wealth group as dependent on livestock at 70 to 77 percent. The main source of livelihood for the poor is kinship 10 and communal support. All groups were significantly in agreement in their responses. Table 1.2.a . Relative proportion size of main livelihood strategies for the different wealth groups Community Gender Rich Middle Poor Lives tock Business Remit tance Lives tock Labour Labour Kinshipsupport Relief Rendille Men 19.0 35.2 64.8 43.0 40.5 16.5 Samburu Men ( W 4 11.5 30.0 24.0 60.0 20.5 < 0.001). The numbers are the median scores for each wealth group as scored by informants during the proportional piling. An inventory of livelihood strategies for communities, disaggregated by wealth groups and gender, revealed that main livelihood strategies are aligned to a person's wealth status and gender. The main livelihood strategy of men from the rich and middle wealth groups across the board was selling their own livestock on the hoof or as meat through butcheries. Women from these wealth categories could sell milk, but milk is rarely sold, because most people have access to it in the rainy season, and the poor without livestock get it for free because they cann ot afford to buy it. Women from rich and middle wealth categories can sell one goat as butchered meat through a local butchery, but not multiple livestock on the hoof. They also sell ghee and animal fat. Men and women from middle and poor wealth groups work as casual labourers, such as herdsmen and herdswomen, as well as domestic maids for the rich. Men herd camels and cattle, whereas women herd sheep and goats. The main livelihood strategies specific to the poor include selling firewood, fodder, gum resins, wild herbs and charcoal. The men also do heavy construction work. Although women from poor households may do heavy work such as scooping sand from riverbeds, they normally do lighter manual duties than men, like washing clothes and doing housework. Among the poor, therefore, gender roles are less clearly defined, as men and women sell firewood, burn and sell charcoal, scoop sand, cut and sell fodder and beg. From the foregoing, it appears that gender division of labour may evolve as a community evolves economically. 11 Table 1.2.b.

Samburu have large herds of ca ttle mainly exploiting a less arid hilly ecosystem of Laisamis while the Rendille have larger herds of camels. The numbers given by key informants have been added to the numbers given by FGD to enable the reader to get a more accurate estimate. The PE exer cise established that the poor were mainly without livestock and worked as labourers for the rich and middle group. Most of the poor got their livestock as wages from herding jobs. The poor may build their own herds in this way, though most of the livestock earned from wage labour is sold for subsistence. Table 1.3.b. presents herd composition in relative proportion per species per wealth group. 12 Table 1.3.a.

Source : FGDs and KIIs . The data from Table 1.3.b. shows that the poor wealth group are not included in the livestock ownership category. The livestock holdings per household in each of the wealth groups are indicated to lie between the median proportion provided by women and men per each species of livestock. Rendille respondents, both men and women, highlighted camels as the dominant species, constituting 32 to 33 percent, in the herds of the rich wealth group. It was also noted that in the Rendille herds, the second most prominent species was sheep, constituting 20 to 28 percent of the herds. However, respondents of both genders from Samburu speakers indicated goats as the dominant species, constituting 24 to 31 percent in the herds of the rich group. The number of sheep in the herds belonging to the Samburu speakers' rich wealth group was marginally higher than the number of camels. The distribution of livestock species in the Rendille middle wealth group shows that goats were the prominent species, constituting 36 percent accor ding to female respondents. However, the male respondents indicated sheep as the prominent species, making up 41 percent of their herd. Both genders of Samburu speaker groups indicated goats as the prominent species of herds belonging to the 13 middle wealth group. Of the large ruminants, cattle constituted a smaller herd at 14 percent of Rendille herds and up to 19 percent in the Samburu speakers' herds. Table 1.3.b.

Source : PE exercise . 1.4 Type and source of food per wealth group Food types and sources were almost constant across wealth groups, but the rich and middle groups had greater access to animal -source foods than the poor. The rich had an adequate supply in terms of quality and quantity of all foods year -round, while the middle wealth group had food deficits and were hence hungry during the dry season. The poor had a deficit year -round and suffered acute and chronic food shortage. The data is presented in Table 1.4 .a. and as word clouds in Figures 1.4.a. to 1.4.c., depicting the relative proportion of food consumed in a normal year in the different wealth groups. 14 Table 1.4.a.

The numbers are the median scores for each wealth group as scored by informants during the proportional piling. The study established that milk is the main food constituent of the rich wealth groups across the genders and Rendille and Samburu respondents. This trend changes with the middle and poor wealth groups, who rely heavily on cereals. The poor consume large quantities of tea beverages, basically black tea, because it is cheap to make, with sugar as the only expensive element. Discussions revealed that strong kinship support existed, where the better off community members were obliged to support the worse off members of the clan or community. Such consi deration was demonstrated when apportioning milk - there was always a ration set aside for the poor. During traditional ceremonies such as Sorio, the rich gave a goat or sheep to the poor to slaughter for their households. The key livestock on which the Rendille and Samburu speakers rely for milk are camels, goats, sheep and cattle. Data from proportional piling of the milk sources (Table 1.4.b.) showed that relatively 69 to 73 percent of the milk was sourced from livestock or shared from kinsmen who own l ivestock, while 27 to 32 percent was sourced from the shops as factory -processed milk. 15 Table 1.4.b.

The numbers are the median scores for each wealth group as scored by informants during the proportional piling. Camels and goats are the main milk producers for the Rendille community (Table 1.4.c.). Camels produce 43 to 44 percent of the milk, while goat milk production constitutes 20 to 24 percent and ranks second. Among the Rendille, sheep are considered better milk producers than cattle due to the small population of cattle kept by the Rendille. The Samburu men considered goats to be the best milk producers (33 percent), closely followed by camels, which produced 31 percent. In contrast, the Samburu women indicated that camels were the main milk producers (40 percent), followed by cattle at 25 percent. Overall the respondents' agreement on responses was weak , with the only significant response being that of the Rendille men. Table 1.4.c.

The numbers are the median scores for each wealth group as scored by informants during the proportional piling. A key animal product mentioned often by both communities was blood. Blood is mainly consumed during migration and in the dry season due to scarcity of food. However, when animals are at home during the wet season, blood is also provided to household members, particularly pregnant and weak women. Between 0.5 litre and 1 litre of blood is collected from the jugular vein. An animal is bled about once a month at most. Animals are mainly slaughtered during ceremonies such as Sorio, male circumcision, and associated Lmuget ceremonies. The communities may also slaughter and eat sick animals before they die. In the dry season, most community members live on cereals (maize a nd beans) and bulky starches like maize meal ( Ugali) and rice. However, the better off community 16 members still access meat and milk, which they buy in small quantities from the market during the dry season. When the dry season worsens to drought, there is little relief food available. Most of the relief food received is sorghum. Some relief food is targeted at the poorer segments of the community, but the poor share it with their better off kin who support them even when there is no relief food. In recognition of this kinship support mechanism, some organizations target all wealth groups with relief food. Relief food is never adequate to support all the hungry community members, but it helps reduce severe malnutrition. Figure 1.4.a. Food types and frequency of mention - Rendille women Figure 1.4.b. Food types and frequency of mention - Rendille men 17 Figure 1.4.c. Food types and frequency of mention - Samburu women Figure 1.4.d. Food types and frequency of mention - Samburu men Other common foods sourced from the market and shops are Ugali (maize meal) and cabbage, which are sometimes eaten together. Ugali is also a usual accompaniment of milk and meat. Githeri , a mixture of maize and beans, is a common evening food in the dry season. Beans are also eaten often. Blood, though mentioned only by the Samburu women, is mixed with milk and considered a meal by all the communities in the rainy season as well as a health booster for weak PLW. 1.5. Livestock diseases and management The Rendille community has borrowed heavily from the Samburu disease lexicon. Most of the Samburu disease names are used interchangeably between the Rendille and Samburu. However, some diseases possess distinct Rendille names (Table 1.5.a. and 1.5.b.). 18 Table 1.5.a.

Top camel diseases from key informant interviews Few key informants knew of camel diseases, with men from Rendille and Samburu communities knowing more camel diseases than women. It was observed that Khanid (hemorrhagic septicaemia) and Omar (trypanosomosis ) were the main diseases according to men and women from the Rendille community. According to both men and women from the Samburu community, Lng'aringari (hemorrhagic septicaemia) was the most important disease in camels. 1.5.2. Top cattle diseases from key informant interviews The cattle diseases named by Samburu key informants included Lkulu p (foot and (anaplasmosis). None of the Rendille informants identified any cattle disease. The Samburu informants, both men and women, identified Lkulup as the most frequently occurring. Samburu men Samburu women Figure 1.5.2. Word cloud of common cattle diseases as identified by Samburu men and women 1.5.3. Top goat and sheep diseases Generally, Rendille men and women mentioned very few goat and sheep diseases. Goat and sheep may have had few diseases, or the people interviewed may have known of only a few. Women identified Nyinyilo (ringworm), Omar (trypanasomiasis), Afturo (orf), Sugar Among sheep diseases, Rendille Nyinyilo, Sirgo and Alfturo . Samburu men and women described more diseases for goats and sheep than the Rendille. This finding suggests that Samburu men and women were more knowledgeable of goat and sheep diseases than the Rendille. Among the goat diseases, men and women identified Lkipei most frequently, followed by Sirgo. Among the sheep diseases, both men and women identified Lbus and Sirgo most frequently. 20 a) Men - goat diseases b) Women - goat diseases c) Men - sheep diseases d) Women - sheep diseases Figure 1.5.3. Word cloud of common goat and sheep diseases as identified by Samburu men (a and c) and women (b and d) 1.6. Seasonal activities, livestock migration and rainfall distribution The seasonal livelihood activities of the Rendille and Samburu revolve around livestock husbandry. The ecosystem is too dry to support any cropping activities. However, a few households have established small kitchen gardens in Korr, Logologo and Lontolio, with the support of international non -governmental organizations (NGOs) using underground water. The main livestock activity is transhumant pastoralism from permanent settlements. Tables 1.6.a. and 1.6.b. provide a description of the seasons for both the Rendille and Samburu, respectively. The seasons are quoted in relation to activities and months named in local names and frequently used in local calenders (Table 1.6.c.). The pastoralists do not migrate permanently, except for some families during some circumcision ceremonies. Families with sons being circumcised move to a new locality not too far from the previous location. Employed herdsmen return to their original homes after they accumulate enough livestock to sustain their livelihood (herdsmen are paid a goat each for every month and a camel or cow for every 10 months). Young men can amass livestock wealth this way, but men with families usually sell the livestock as they earn them, to sustain their families. 21 Table 1.6.a.

However, when 22 the reference period is a year or shorter, the equivalence of months between the Gregorian and local calendars may apply. 1.6.1 Seasonal livestock migrations and relationship with rains and animal disease Livestock migration happens during the dry season, with the animals moving over 50 km or less in the normal dry spells (e.g. in Olturot the livestock moves around Mount Kulal). When there is a prolonged dry season culminating in drought, livestock moves a long way into the neighbouring counties of Samburu and Laikipia. See examples of specific Samburu description maps below as described by Nchulan Alyaro, a female key informant from Laisamis. Table 1.6.1 . Description of livestock migration route map Situation in Laisamis From To Duration of a trek in hours or days Remarks End of rains Laisamis Koya 4 hours Dry Koya Saori 2 days At Saori, the group may take one of two options Option A Soari Louwa Nyiro 2 days Louwa Nyiro days Rains Baragoi Laisamis 17 days It is hard to tell how long animals stay in one place, as it depends on the available vegetation. Respondents from both Rendille and Samburu developed a seasonal activity calendar for livestock migration compared to rain distribution. The calendars are depicted in graphic format in Figures 1.6.a., 1.6.b., 1.6.c. and 1.6.d. 23 Figure 1.6.a. Livestock migration by Rendille women Figure 1.6.b. Livestock migration by Rendille men Figure 1.6.c. Livestock migration by Samburu women Figure 1.6.d. Livestock migration by Samburu men All respondents depicted a bimodal rainfall pattern in their activity calendar. Rainfall is experienced in March and April, a season known as the short wet season locally. During this period, there is a dip in the migration curves, indicating limited migration, and almost all livestock migrate back to their home locations. The Rendille men indicated that the second round of rains starts in October, while the Rendille women indicated a gentle rise of the rainfall curve from August to peak in November. Similarly, gender differences were exhibited by respondents from Samburu. Whereas the men stated that the second rains start in the month of September, Samburu women indicated that the second rains start with light showers in August. The short dry seasons occur in January and February, while the long dry season is in May to September. General livestock migration is common during both dry seasons. However, at the peak of the long dry seasons, mainly July and August, as well as at the peak of the short dry season in February, the lactating herds become dry and migrate from the villages. 24 1.7 Access and control of milk The study sought to understand who milks and apportions mi lk after milking for use within the household. Camels are milked by men only, but all other species are milked by men and women as well as boys and girls. Adequate milk for the calf/lamb/kid is left by milking half the udder or skipping one of the milkings (e.g. evening milk). Calves, kids and lambs are often separated from their mothers in the evening. Irrespective of who milks, all milk is given to the female head of household or wife of the household head for allocation. The woman may mix milk from diff erent species and allocate accordingly or allocate each species' milk. Except in situations where specific family members prefer or react to certain animal species' milk, milk from all species is pooled prior to allocation. In most villages, people do not sell milk because there is no milk market. Almost every household has plenty of milk in the rainy season, and those that do not have milk are too poor to afford it. The poor are, therefore, given milk free of charge in line with the strong kinship support system. 1.7.1. Access to milk for children and for women and factors that determine it Men and women FGD discussants from the Rendille and the Samburu communities indicated that availability of milk to children and women is determined by the season. Milk is available to women and children during the rainy season, when there is adequate pasture and animals are herded close to the villages. Milk is also available in the early dry season or during periods when the droughts are mild and the animals are not to o far from the villages. The factors that determine milk availability include the following: availability of rainfall availability of pasture and water presence of a milking animal near the homestead In the dry season, when there are no milking animals in or close to the villages, availability of income to the women determines their access to factory -processed long -life milk or milk powder for their children and personal consumption. 1.7.1.a. Milk allocation by women to household members (aggregate foc us group discussion proportional piling data) Only one FGD with Samburu women indicated that they sold 5 percent of the milk they produced. All other women indicated that they did not sell milk. Asked why they allocated so little to themselves, most women indicated that milk was almost never enough. As the ones allocating, they got what was left over. They explained that children got a lot because they needed it to grow. Children also brought friends home, and they shared this milk with their friends. The warriors got the lion's share because they often herded and milked the camels and 25 were rewarded for it. They also visited in groups, and the portion included a little extra for a few friends. Husbands were given a large share because they owned the animals. The needy people's portion varied according to how many needy persons were supported by the household. Table 1.7.1. Mean proportions of milk allocated by women to the household Category allocated Husband Morans (warriors) Children Mothers Others (the needy) Mean proportions allocated by Samburu women FGDs 25 35 25 8 7 Mean proportions allocate d by Rendille women FGDs 16 32 28 4 20 Women gave themselves special consideration when pregnant and lactating. Depending on a pregnant woman's situation in terms of appetite and food preferences during pregnancy, she could keep the same milk ration or increase it. The portion increased during pregnancy hardly ever brought the new ration above 10 percent. Lactating mothers, on the other hand, typically have a larger appetite, and their ration increased to exceed 10 percent. In this study, the highest recorded allocation for lactating mothers was 20 percent, and the lowest was 13 percent. Extra milk allocated to PLW was obtained from the large rations for warriors, children and fathers and from the needy's share. The decision on which portion to obtain from was at the woman's discretion. Access of milk for women was also, therefore, determined by their physiological status. They may access more milk during pregnancy and always access more during lactation. Sometimes PLW accompany migrating livestock if they are not going too far from the villages i n order to access milk. At other times, a camel and/or a few goats are left behind during animal movement so that they provide milk for mothers and children. This flexibility in herding patterns also determines women's access to milk. 1.7.2. Patterns of milk availability and production from livestock Milk production by the livestock was captured in a seasonal calendar. The pattern of milk production is dependent on the rains. The Rendille women respondents (Figure 1.7.2.a.) noted that during the months of March and April as well as October, November and December were the two peaks in milk production from all species of livestock. These milk production peaks correspond to seasonal rainfall peaks. Figure 1.7.2.b. demonstrates that long rains occurring in Oct ober and November initiate a surge in milk in all animals. However, during the short rains of March to April, the increase in production of milk among the different species appears to follow no specific pattern (Figure 1.7.2.b.) The goat and sheep have early shared production peaks, while camel and cattle lag in production into the dry season. The Samburu -speaking women's calendar (Figure 1.7.2.c.) shows a relatively uniform milk production that gently rises upwards in October at the start of the long rains. Figure 1.7.2.d. shows the bimodal milk production for goats as 26 described by Samburu men. For cattle and camels, there was a slight production decline during dry season, but it improved with the October rains. Figure 1.7.2.a . Seasonal milk production by Rendille women Figure 1.7.2.b .

Seasonal milk production by Samburu men 27 The following tables summarize the responses of men and women from the Samburu and Rendille communities studied. Milk availability, ceremonies and nutritional status of women and children were aligned with the seasons, but recent climatic changes have caused much confusion as to when phenomena really occur. Often, focus group discussants indicated that they were working with past years' knowledge, as currently nothing seems to follow the known pattern. Table 1.7.2.a.

Ceremonies that are of nutritional benefit to the community The focus group discussants were asked to list the traditional ceremonies associated with feasting and hence bringing animals back home for the ceremony. At these ceremonies, all community members are entitled to meat and milk. Other ceremonies may involve animals but do not benefit any community member or may benefit different segments of communities inequitably. The ceremonies as presented by men and women from the two communities are pres ented in Table 1.7.3. Table 1.7.3.

Almatho : The male head of a household goes to the prayer shrine - nabo - for prayers. Women prepare a special gourd of sour (camel, cattle, sheep, goat or mixed) milk for three weeks and deliver it at the nabo. Young men are fed on that milk. A portion of leftover milk is made wit h some herbs into a tea, which is drunk by everybody. It lasts one week and is normally carried out during the rainy season when milk is in plenty. When Almatho is skipped because of drought, a double ceremony to compensate the skipped one is performed the following year. Almatho : Every male head of a household goes to the prayer shrine - nabo - for prayers. Women prepare a special gourd of milk and deliver it there. Milk from all milking species can be used - usually in a mixed form. Young men are fed that milk. A portion of leftover milk is made with some herbs into a tea, which is drunk by everybody.

If Almatho is skipped because of drought, a double ceremony to compensate the skipped one is carried out when it rains. Almatho : Every male head of a household goes to the prayer shrine located in the homestead - nabo - for prayers. Women prepare a special gourd of milk and deliver it there. Young men are fed that milk. A portion of leftover milk is made with some herbs into a tea, which is drunk by everybody. Almatho ceremony lasts about a week. It is normally carried out once a year during the rainy season as at that time milk is in plenty. In case it is skipped because of a drought, two ceremonies will be carried out in a subsequent year, when it rains, to compensate for the skipped one. Almatho : Every male head of a household goes to the prayer shrine - nabo - for prayers. A woman prepares a special gourd of milk and delivers it there. Young men are fed that milk. A portion of leftover milk is made with some herbs into a tea, which is drunk by everybody. It lasts one week. It is normally carried out during the rainy season, as at that time milk is in plenty. If it is skipped because of drought, it is compensated for in the year it rains next. In that year, two Almatho ceremonies are held. Khandi : It is held every 12 years and lasts 2 months. A goat is slaughtered for each young man before and after circumcision. Khandi : This male circumcision ceremony is held every 12 years and lasts 2 months. A goat is slaughtered for each young man before and after circumcision. Muratare: It is held every tenyears and lasts three months. It normally takes place in the months of March and April. Families with boys to be circumcised migrate to a commonplace called Lorora . A family can choose to return to their previous homestead or settle at the new place they have built during the ceremony. A goat is slaughtered for each young man (e.g. if a family has three boys, three goats are slaughtered). Muratare: It is held every ten years and lasts three months. It normally takes place in the months of March and April. Families with boys to be circumcised migrate to a commo nplace called Lorora. After the ceremony, a family can choose to go back to where they had settled previously or settle at that point. A goat is slaughtered for each young man. If a family has three boys, three goats have to be slaughtered. Mayan: This is a thanksgiving ceremony to pray for blessings for the land, animals and people. The ceremony is organized by individuals and may involve slaughter of an animal, which is then eaten by those present.

Goats are slaughtered away from the homestead at a place with only men. Subsequent Lmugets are conducted within two years of the first. The second Lmuget gives the generation of initiates a name and the third and last Lmuget allows the initiates to marry. the Samburu than the Rendille. The first Lmuget takes place about two weeks after the circumcision ceremony. Goats are slaughtered away from the homestead at a place with only men. *Rendille do not usually observe Lmuget. They are not as involved in the same circumcision and rites of passage as the Samburu. A ceremony called Galgulam is conducted by the Rendille. Gaal means camels, and gulame means exodus. People bring all their camels to a place called Namarei. There, elders lead prayers and the recently initiated age set is given authority to marry. Young warriors must attend (Jitewa, WSU Marsabit). All members of the households benefit from the Sorio, Almatho, Muratare/Khandi and Mayan ceremonies as they all eat meat in all ceremonies but drink milk during Almatho . Men are the beneficiaries of Lmuget and Galgulum ceremonies, where they are the only ones who partake of the slaughtered livestock. There are no benefits nutritionally derived from Herr ceremonies. 1.8. Men and women's work activity calendars A comparison of the women's work calendar with that of men was plotted along the rainfall pattern for both Rendille and Samburu respondents (Figures 1.8.a., 1.8.b., 1.8.c. and 1.8.d.). During the dry season, the work increases for both Rendille women and men (Figure 1.8.a.). The peak of the workload is July and August in the long dry season. During the wet seasons, men have little work to do, as most livestock are around home compounds, and the duties are delegated to warriors and children (Figure 1.8.b.). Women's workload may reduce at times but not as drastically as is the case for men. Similar observations were made on Samburu men and women's workloads. During the dry season, the men's work curve spikes due to the increased workload of migrating, digging wells, building kraals and securing the herds (Figure 1.8.c.). However, during the wet season, these duties are abandoned as animals return home, where men take rest. 31 Figure 1.8.a . Men and women work calendar by Rendille women Figure 1.8.b. Men and women work calendar by Rendille men Figure 1.8.c. Men and women work calendar by Samburu women Figure 1.8.d . Men and women work calendar by Samburu men Further analyses were carried out using the activity clock tool in FGDs. During the rainy season, Rendille men have four productive activities spanning their awake time, and Rendille women have three productive and five reproductive activities spanning the same period. In addition to counting the number of productive and reproductive activities , looking at the effort required to do these and other activities is necessary. For example, how does fetching water and firewood compare with, say, herding near the homestead? 32 Figure 1.8.e. Wet season daily activity clock for Rendille women and men from Korr In the wet season, women spent the day engaging in multiple physically taxing productive and reproductive activities. They included herding calves, kids and lambs; milking cattle and goats; cooking; preparing milk calabashes; fetching water and firewood; and caring for children and others. Men engaged in two main activities: herding camels and milking them. The women explained that they got very tired every day and linked the high rate of pregnant women's malnutrition to fatigue associated with the wo rk burden. One man stated that women liked keeping busy. Older men did not have activities but made decisions on animals because they owned them. In the dry season, the animals moved away, and men and women's responsibilities shifted with this change. Older men and most women and children stayed at home during the dry season. In the dry season, women's time for productive activities reduced by 360 minutes (6 hours) and men's by 80 minutes. Women's activities reduced from 10 to 7 and men's activities from 5 to 4. Women's cooking time increased by 60 minutes because they cooked porridge and maize and beans as opposed to mixing milk and blood or cooking U gali to eat with milk the way they did in the dry season. The time spent fetching water and firewood also i ncreased by 120 minutes (2 hours). In the dry season, however, women and men slept and rested more than in the rainy season. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Men WomenSleep Productive activities: Herding Productive activities: Treatment / inspection Productive activities: Milking Productive activities: Make beads and sisal ropes Productive activities: Aid with calves/kids/lambs Productive activities: Prepare milk containers Reproductive activities: Cook Reproductive activities: Fetch water and firewood Reproductive activities: Eat meals Reproductive activities: Rest33 The experience doing activity calendars with male focus group discussants was difficult because all the young men did in the dry season was herd animals, while the old men stayed at home in the dry and rainy seasons and could not account for their time. Thereafter, activity calendars were done with only women to try and harmonize calendars for each community. Figure 1.8.f. Dry season daily activity clock for Rendille women and men from Korr Activity clocks for Rendille women in the rainy and dry seasons were presented side by side. Typically, all FGDs reported sleeping early and waking up late in the dry season and the opposite in t he rainy season. When livestock were in the village, the women were busy; there was food, singing and dancing. Children were weaned during this period. One woman from a women-only FGD in Korr said, \"We tend to give children more livestock milk and deny them our breasts to take a break from being suckled.\" All but one FGD reported that women herded cattle, sheep and goats and their young ones by going to pick them from the bush and bring them home. Time spent collecting water and firewood in Korr varied wi th location rather than season. In Korr, permanent boreholes existed, and they were not too far from the villages. In Kargi, there was no borehole, and time taken to collect water in the dry season was much longer than in the rainy season. Firewood collection was an arduous task during both wet and dry seasons. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Men WomenSleep Productive activities: Herding and/or watering Productive activities: Milking Productive activities: Make beads ropes Productive activities: Milk few goats/sheep Productive activities: Prepare milk containers Reproductive activities: Cook Reproductive activities: Fetch water and firewood Reproductive activities: Eat meals Rest34 Figure 1.8.g. Rendille women daily activity clocks for the rainy and dry seasons The activity/workload pattern for Samburu was very similar to that of the Rendille and is not shown here. In conclusion, women have a heavy workload in the rainy and dry seasons , but in the rainy season, they at least have enough food and are able to stay healthy. In the dry season, they do not have enough food. They mainly eat porridge, Ugali and Githeri (a boiled mixture of maize and beans), which are mainly carbohydrates. The quantities are low, and the community members are chronically hungry. Women from both the Rendille and Samburu communities attributed being thin and malnourished during the dry season to t his heavy workload. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Rainy season Dry seasonRest Reproductive activities: Prepare cabashes for use next season Reproductive activities: Eat meals Reproductive activities: Wash/clean Reproductive activities: Fetch water and firewood Reproductive activities: Cook Reproductive activities: Prepare milk containers Productive activities: Aid with calves/kids/lambs Productive activities: Make beads and sisal ropes Productive activities: Milking Productive activities: Casual labor and small business Productive activities: Herding Sleep35 Objective 2 . To understand malnutrition in children and women 2.1. The peaks of child malnutrition and the associated indicators Seasonal calendar data was plotted in curves. The curve of child malnutrition steadily rises shortly after rains decline at the end of the month of April (Figure 2.1.a.). The curve then rises over time, and with the drought, to peak in the months of July and August, when the dry spell is at its harshest. The decline in rains has a direct relationship with malnutrition. It was observed that there were abundant food varieties and quantities during the rainy season for the children and PLW. However, during the dry season there is a decline in food varieties and quantities and in the amount of mothers' milk for children as well as milk from camels and goats. Malnutrition in PLW follows the same pattern and peaks in July and August. Birth curves did not show drastic changes, although a low spike appears in August at the time of stress, followed by a rise towards th e month of December. For the Rendille women, the month of August is the most stressful due to increased workload, increase in women's disease and lack of animal -source foods due to migrated livestock. The trend is similar for the Samburu respondents. Figure 2.1.a.i. Patterns of child malnutrition and associated indicators for Rendille community Figure 2.1.a.ii. Patterns of child malnutrition and milk production for Rendille community 36 Figure 2.1.a.iii.

Patterns of child malnutrition and milk production for Samburu community Figure 2.1.b.iii. Patterns of malnutrition and associated indicators for Samburu community Figure 2.1.b.iv. Patterns of malnutrition and associated indicators for Samburu community The hunger periods for everybody, including women and children, were in the dry season and intensified in the month of July (see Table 1.7.2.a. and Table 1.7.2.b. 38 seasonal calendars). A comparative analysis of community descriptions of malnutrition and official average Marsabit MUAC < 135 mm percentage figures for 3 years is presented in Figure 2.1.a.i. It was observed that MUAC < 135 mm percentage figures are highest in March and October, just before or on the start of the rains in both wet seasons when lack of food is at the peak. The MUAC < 135 percentage figures gently reduce after the rains and are low most of the dry season until next peak of dry season when they rise. It is at this time community description of malnutrition is highest. However community description of malnutrition is referred to through most of the dry seasons indicating that the community description of malnutrition has a large element of hunger description in it. Although August and September are dry, the Sorio feasts in these two months provide respite from hunger. Moreover, flash rains lasting a day or two in July stimulate some pasture growth. These July rains seem to have ceased in Marsabit County but still occur in Samburu County, according to a male key informant from Lontolio. 39 2.2.

The numbers are the median scores for each wealth group as scored by informants during the proportional piling. The questions on the nutrition of women and children were never answered by men in FGD s, who indicated that women were best placed to answer these questions. Responses to these questions are therefore from women's focus group discussants and from male and female key informants. 40 2.2.2. Causes of malnutrition responses from focus group discussions Women identified three causes of malnutrition in women. The first was inadequate food, which they associated with the prolonged droughts resulting from erratic rains because of climate change. Droughts are lasting longer and becoming more frequent. Women f rom all 12 women's FGDs also stated that women's heavy workload is a major cause of their poor nutritional status, because they are always too busy and then too tired to eat well, especially during pregnancy and lactation. 2.3. Patterns of malnutrition for a child at different stages of growth According to all women's focus group discussants from both Rendille and Samburu categories, most children affected by severe malnutrition are below 60 months of age. Among them, children 24-36 months old are most se verely affected, because they may have stopped suckling as their mothers' milk is almost or completely dry, but they are still heavily dependent on milk and are only starting to learn to chew solid food. During times of animal milk shortage or lack, cereal s - more specifically maize and beans, which these children cannot chew, and maize -based Ugali and porridge - become the main diet in households. The second most severely affected are children 1 -2 years old, because they are still suckling, but mother's mi lk may no longer be enough to sustain them because they are big. Childred aged 0 -1 are less severely affected because their mothers' milk is still a large component of their diet. Similarly, 3 - to 5-year -olds are able to chew semisolid and some solid foods and are, therefore, less severely affected. At 2-3 years, children, even thin ones, are too heavy and active to strap on the mother's back as she works away from the home (e.g. fetching water or firewood and working for others). Moreover, most women no longer produce milk at this point of their reproductive cycle. These 2 - to 3-year-old children are, therefore, left behind at home with older siblings, with elderly women , and with women with very small babies of their own. These often picky -eater children eat even less under the care of siblings and elderly relatives who may not understand what might enable the children to eat more or who may not have the mother's patience to feed them. Mothers with little babies may not be able to provide the required attention to the 2 - to 3-year -old children and hence not feed them adequately. Women from most FGDs said that their children suffered poor health at this age and became worse in severe droughts when there were no animals to milk. In return for the caregiving s upport, mothers of these 2 - to 3-year -old children worked for the elderly and mothers of small babies (e.g. they brought them water and firewood). Most Rendille women focus group discussants indicated that they had observed that boys of all ages were more vulnerable than girls and became more malnourished, whereas women from Samburu-speaking groups stated that there was no difference in malnutrition between boys and girls. The Rendille women were not, however, able to explain why boys were more vulnerable to malnutrition than girls. The differences in response between these two ethnic categories might be explained by the understanding that the Rendille might be able to discern a 41 gendered pattern of malnutrition because they occupy a drier ecosystem (Korr an d Kargi) and experience more severe droughts and more pronounced malnutrition than the Samburu, who occupy less austere ecosystems (Laisamis and Lontolio). 2.4. Diets of healthy vs malnourished children disaggregated by age This question was rephrased to compare foods constituting diets of children from rich and poor households rather than healthy and malnourished children, because sometimes the healthy poor and malnourished poor eat different quantities of similar foods. The comparison revealed that children from rich households had adequate amounts of a wide variety of food types, and the poor had limited quantities of a narrower spectrum of food types than the rich (Figure 2.4.a. and 2.4.b.). A female Rendille focus group discussant from Korr stated, \"Th e rich have a variety of meals to choose from unlike the poor person who takes what's available.\" Similarly, a bilingual Samburu -speaking female focus group discussant from Laisamis stated, \"The rich can afford adequate quantities of different food types to feed their children, which the poor cannot.\" Figure 2.4.a. Word cloud depicting foods for children from wealthy households Figure 2.4.b. Word cloud depicting foods for children from poor households 2.5. Patterns and causes of malnutrition in women and diets of healthy vs malnourished pregnant women; diets of healthy vs malnourished lactating mothers As for children, the question on comparisons of diets of healthy and malnourished PLW was paraphrased to compare diets of the rich and poor. 2.5.1. Ca uses of malnutrition according to women's focus group discussions Only women's FGDs were asked questions on malnutrition, because men's FGDs early in the study indicated that women were best placed to answer questions on malnutrition. The same question had been explored exhaustively through KIIs. As explained in Section 1.7.2. on seasonal calendars, patterns of malnutrition among women and children follow the patterns of drought and are the same for women and children. Malnutrition peaks in July, August and September, but women and children are worst hit in the month of July, when it is cold, windy and 42 dry. In August and September, the stress is less severe because of the Sorio events, which require every household to slaughter a goat or sheep for household consumption. The signs of malnutrition are presented in Table 2.5. Table 2.5. Signs of malnutrition among children and pregnant and lactating women Signs of malnutrition Causes / drivers of malnutrition Children Big stomach Lack of appetite Not active Emaciated Weak Lack of food Presence of intestinal worms Insufficient quantity of breast milk Pregnant and lactating women Weak Thin Dizziness Lack of food Disease Overworking 2.5.2. Causes of malnutrition according to key informant interviews Causes of malnutrition in PLW and children given by key informants were so similar that an aggregate account of men and women from the two communities in this study has been presented in this section. 2.5.2.a. Causes of malnutrition in pregnant women The main cause of malnutrition in pregnant women is poor access to foods of good nutritional value. Many pregnant women lack milk, soup and meat. Before the recurrent droughts, there was enough food and pregnancy was not a \"condition.\" Women gave birth while herding animals; the only help a woman having a baby needed was for a child to pass her a stone, which she used to cut the umbilical cord. Then she'd go home in the evening with the animals and her newborn baby. (Woman bilingual speaker KII, Laisamis) Nausea and pickiness are other causes of malnutrition in pregnant women. Some women are also unable to afford the food they would like to eat because they are too poor. Some women are malnourished because of ignorance - they do not heed advice given at pre natal clinics. Overworking (looking after animals) and performing other household activities cause the women to be chronically exhausted such that inadequacy of nutritious food has an even greater effect than if they were not so tired. Diseases such as anaemia cause women to lose appetite and exacerbate the malnutrition. Other causes that may lead to malnutrition of pregnant women include the withdrawal of support from the husband as a result of falling out with him and the competition for food in a large f amily. 43 Other causes of malnutrition for pregnant women could be the failure to use iron - folic acids due to poor monitoring of health owing to far -flung health service facilities. Food taboos for women, such as eggs and chicken among many Samburu and Rendi lle women, deny them the opportunity to benefit from keeping chickens, which are a great source of proteins and energy (Figure 2.5.2.a.). 2.5.2.b. Causes of malnutrition in lactating women For lactating women, as for pregnant women, inadequate access to nutritious food such as milk, soup and meat due to poverty is a major cause of malnutrition. Many lactating women lack the money to buy healthy foods. Diseases resulting from poor hygiene may also lead to malnutrition, but educating the women on hygiene and nutrition is changing all this. Overworking has also been associated with malnutrition among lactating women. Lack of food due to poverty and cultural food taboos, such as women not being allowed to eat eggs and chicken, is another factor (Figure 2.5.2.a.). Figure 2.5.2.a. Conceptual presentation of drivers of malnutrition in women - including pregnant and lactating ones - as given in key informant interviews and focus group discussions In sum, the drivers of malnutrition in women are complex and intertwined, as demonstrated in Figure 2.5.a. This complexity makes their classification into the typically linear primary, intermediate and secondary causes problematic. Nevertheless, the conceptual diagram enables the visualization of this complexity. Climate c hange is a major cause because the resultant drought has caused poverty through livestock deaths. Another direct cause of poverty is large families in this context of limited resources. Droughts have resulted in the prolonged absence of livestock from the homesteads, and this absence has denied families access to milk, blood and meat from their own herds. Owing to lack of money caused by 44 poverty, families are unable to purchase milk and meat, both of which are available in the market. Malnutrition can affec t any family member and compromises the nutritional status of the ill person through loss of appetite and loss of food and nutrients through conditions such as vomiting, malabsorption of food and diarrhoea. This study has identified nine primary causes of malnutrition specific to women, which could have been muted if gender analysis had not been conducted. In this community, assets belong to men. Women have usufruct rights due to access enabled them through their being married to, daughters of, or sisters to the male owners of these assets. If a woman falls out with her husband, she is usually denied access to livestock products as well as money. Owing to ignorance, people, including women, follow cultural norms without questioning them. Norms such as food taboos and overworking women are linked to the identity of virtue in a woman, and women adhere to such norms and ensure adherence to them through training upcoming generations. This socialization can be overcome by teachings in health and nutrition, which continue in most communities. In communities located in remote areas without healthcare and nutrition service providers, these norms are strongly entrenched. Increasing access to health and nutrition teaching services gradually erodes such norms. The physio logical status of lactation requires that a woman eats enough to keep both her and her child healthy. Lactating women get hungrier than non- lactating women and therefore need larger quantities of nutrient-dense foods. Inability to provide foods for such women causes them chronic hunger, which is exacerbated by the social norms of overworking them and the food taboos that forbid them from eating easy -to-raise, nutrient -dense poultry products like meat, soup and eggs. Nutritional education enables women to see the need to seek these foods and to question those taboos. Further exposure, especially to socially deviant (e.g. urban) communities, enables women adhering to these taboos to question and defy them. The physiological status of pregnancy also predisposes pregnant women to further malnutrition because of nausea, which is most common in the early trimester of pregnancy but may continue to different extents into the duration of the pregnancy. In addition to nausea, the selective appetite can be for less nutr itionally valuable foods. 2.5.2.c. Causes of malnutrition in children Low milk production by the mother because of lack of food or poor feeding during and immediately after pregnancy is a major cause of malnutrition in children from poor families. Food t aboos for the mother may also contribute to poor nutrition of the mother and child. Failure to breastfeed children exclusively for 6 months owing to the cultural belief in the healing power of camel milk for \"meconium disease\" is another cause. So is poor hygiene and lack of knowledge by the mother of ways to prevent diseases like anaemia, pneumonia and malaria. Lack of, or poor access to, food because of poverty or migration of all milking animals during the dry months is a common cause of child malnutrition. Some mothers lacking nutritional 45 knowledge feed children with inferior value foods ; consequently poor access to diverse, nutrient rich foods is considered a secondary driver to undernutrition. A sick child will feed poorly and is likely to suffer from malnutrition (Figure 2.5.2.b.). Figure 2.5.2.b. Conceptual presentation of the drivers of malnutrition in children as given in key informant interviews and focus group discussions Factors affecting access of women to nutrition -dense animal -source food af fect children's nutrition (Figure 2.5.b.). Factors specific to children include cultural norms that promote introduction of raw camel milk as a complementary food for the child at birth. The shock to the neonate's system during the act of cleaning out meco nium, which is considered to be dirt from the womb, must disrupt the child's physiology. Although the children turn out to be well enough later in life, it might be useful to establish how this practice affects neonates. Fortunately, the campaign to breast feed children exclusively for the first 6 months of life is on, but the extent of adoption of this practice remains unclear. It might be useful to investigate the adoption of exclusive breastfeeding and address some of the cultural practices and their expl anations (discourses) that might undermine this campaign. Having a chronically hungry mother reduces the child's intake from the mother's milk because there is not enough milk. 46 2.6. Demographic determinants of malnutrition 2.6.1. Patterns of pregnancies and births Some women and men among the focus group discussants could not fathom the question about patterns of pregnancies and births. Particularly the men were not apt to discussion on the matter and they expressed surprise that people would consider breeding seasonally like animals. Other women stated that during the festivities of the rainy season, there is a lot of sexual activity, and conception rates are likely to be high. In the rainy season, when men return from cattle camps, they really want to have sex - they are like billy goats (laughter). At that time, we want to rest our bodies from being suckled since there is so much livestock milk that we deny children our breasts. These two things cause us to get pregnant in the rainy season. (Women' s FGD group, Kargi) We do not know which month it is, but there are months when the postnatal clinics are almost empty and months when the clinics are packed with babies; we could be having children in certain seasons (Women's FGD discussants, Laisamis) From the foregoing, there appears to be a seasonal dimension to childbearing. These anecdotal findings could be confirmed by checking the antenatal clinic attendance data for the last few years in those locations. Some women plan to get pregnant at a time when birthing will coincide with the rainy season when there is plenty of milk and livestock to be slaughtered. These women, however, go through a very hard third trimester of pregnancy when it is very dry and there is hardly any food. (Women's FGD g roup, Laisamis) Might this hunger during the last trimester of pregnancy predispose the newborn child to malnutrition later in life? This was suggested in Section 2.5.2. 47 2.7. Patterns of weaning times for children Traditionally, newborn babies are given camel milk as a complementary food, which is said to clean out the meconium that is considered bad for the newborn. After a few bouts of diarrhoea and vomiting, the neonate stabilizes and becomes strong, then continu es suckling the mother and drinking camel milk. Camel milk is considered as good as mother's milk because it is light and hence easy to digest. It is also considered very healthy and is given un -boiled. Two questions to investigate are whether camel milk c omposition is close to the composition of mother's milk and whether boiling camel milk could change its composition. 2.8. Patterns of human disease occurrence in children and women of reproductive age 2.8.1. Children's diseases Ranking of children diseases varied by FGD and made it difficult to establish which was the most common children's disease (Table 2.8.1). Table 2.8.1. Children's diseases ranked Rank Disease Local name When it occurs Why it occurs then Rendille women 1 Common cold Argap July Dry cold season 2 Diarrhoea Adah June/July Dry cold season 3 Vomiting Jilbibo July/August Dry cold season 4 Pneumonia Rofo July Dry cold season Samburu women 1 Diarrhoea Nkorotit March/April Rainy season 2 Cough Ichanat July Dry cold season 3 Pneumonia Igoo July Dry cold season 4 Vomiting Rugumat July/August Dry cold season 5 Fever Any time Sick child 5 Malaria March/April Rainy season 48 2.8.2. Pregnant and lactating women's diseases There was not much difference in responses by Rendille - and Samburu -speaking women. Anaemia was the most common condition of PLW (Table 2.8.2). Table 2.8.2. Diseases of pregnant and lactating women, ranked Rank Disease When it occurs Why it occurs then Samburu women 1 Anaemia July/August Dry cold season 2 Pneumonia July Dry cold season 3 Malaria April and October Rainy season 4 Cough April and October Rainy season 5 Headache June/July Dry cold season Key informants' accounts of children's diseases gave diarrhoea as the most mentioned disease. Using frequency of mention as a proxy for frequency of occurrence, it appears that diarrhoea was the most common disease. It was, however, not clear what disease came after diarrhoea (Figure 2 .8.a.-d.). a) Rendille m en b) Rendille w omen c) Samburu men d) Women - sheep diseases Figure 2.8.a. -d. Common children's diseases 49 A word cloud was made with all the KII responses from women and men aggregated to try and establish an order of mention of diseases by all the KII respondents (Figure 2.8.e.). Diarrhoea stood out as the main condition, followed by malaria, vomit, and cough , and then by fever and colds. Malnutrition was mentioned more than once, but even in the aggregate word cloud, it was the tenth most frequently mentioned, making it tenth in this proxy ranking. Malnutrition may not be considered a disease, and if considered a disease, then it occurs less frequently than all the others mentioned before it. Figure 2.8.e. Common children's diseases (sex aggregated) 2.9. Relationship between the peaks in diseases and malnutrition patterns The only disease that seems to peak in the rainy season is malaria. Some coughs and diarrhoea occur in the rainy and dry season, and fevers occur whenever there is an illness rather than during a specific season. All other diseases - common cold, pneumonia and vomiting in children, and anaemia, pneumonia, and headaches in PLW - occur in the dry, cold season (July, August and September). 50 Objective 3 . To understand communities' perspectives on practices and programming used to minimize malnutrition 3.1. Traditional practices for minimizing malnutrition and current trends Traditional practices for minimizing malnutrition given by men and women from the gender - and ethnicity -disaggregated FGDs drew strictly on the livestock resources, whereas current practices depend mostly on moder n remedies like Plumpy'Nut and nutrient -dense porridge for children and on nutrient -dense porridge for women and their families (Table 3.1.). The Plumpy'Nut is also called \"chocolate\" by the local community. It is made of peanut butter enriched with milk, sugar and oil. It is interesting to note that children under 60 months are not given blood and pregnant women are not given animal fat in traditional nutrients. Almost all female FGD participants indicated that giving pregnant women much fat would cause abortion. As a cultural practice, children under 5 years are not given blood. Ghee (clarified butter) added to milk is given to malnourished children to fatten them. It was also observed that traditional practices are not a treatment per se but normal diet f or children and women. However, current practices from humanitarian agencies are interventions during difficult times when malnutrition sets in. Table 3.1.

Traditional practices Current practices Children Pregnant women Lactating women Figure 3.1. Word clouds to depict traditional and current diets used to prevent/cure malnutrition in children and in pregnant and lactating women Dietary diversity from local food resources (livestock) has been lost in addressing malnutrition in the communities interviewed. Clearly, the communities are dependent on imported products, Plumpy'Nut and porridge for children and porridge for the PLW. This lack of diversity of foods and food sources makes all three categories of the community extremely vulnerable to malnutrition if the distributing organizations fail to deliver. Moreover, the Plumpy'Nut and porridge are not always available. The Plumpy'Nut is given only to malnourished children without consideration of the child's siblings who are chronically hungry but fail the MUAC test. Two women from two different Samburu FGDs in Laisamis stated: We watch our little girls tie their stomachs tightly with cloth wraps to deal will the hunger pangs. Our little boys try to distract themselves from hunger by playing with th eir penises, they pull and twist them until they become sore. 52 Asked what malnutrition prevention services they preferred the most, women stated that they preferred receiving porridge and cash, which they took home and shared with the family. The porridge is usually little, and they share small portions of it. Sometimes they share it with wealthy relatives who might have run out of food stocks as a result of supporting large numbers of poor relatives. The cash comes off and on and is welcome each time it is received. Sometimes the porridge flour is expired and may contain insects. Women throw it away if it has weevils, maggots, an \"off\" smell or any other objectionable organoleptic characteristic. Plumpy'Nut really helps malnourished children who still have an appetite, as it makes them healthy again quickly. 3.2. Interventions provided by non -governmental organizations, government and community (for children, pregnant women and lactating mothers) Interventions were similar in the areas occupied by Rendille and Samburu, with World Vision International (WVI) bearing the lion's share of responsibility for children, pregnant women and lactating mothers. WVI's intervention has had such a great impact that other vulnerable groups appear to stand out as needier th an children and PLW. The county government has a wide coverage, like WVI, and has reached distant communities with health services and drugs by providing the personnel and medicines. They also provide some relief food. Rendille men and women (Korr and Karg i) 1. WVI - Distributes Plumpy'Nut and nutrient -enriched porridge flour 2. Food for the Hungry International - Provides relief food 3. County government - Offers free hospital services and some relief food 4. PACIDA - Provides relief food to the community Samburu men and women (Lontolio and Laisamis) 1. WVI - Distributes Plumpy'Nut, provides transportation for women to go and deliver in the hospital, provides tanks and gives the poor sheep and goats 2. World Food Program me - Provides cash transfers 3. County government - Offers free hospital services and some relief food 4. Boma - Runs a money transfer program me and gives women phones 5. Sauti Moja - Gives camels to the people in the village 53 Table 3.2. The benefits and weaknesses of these interventions in reducing malnutrition Organization Benefits World Vision International Conduct home visits to provide medication, educate people on hygiene, measure malnutrition and provide Plumpy'Nut and nutritious porridge flour Support construction of pit latrines (Laisamis) County Government of Kenya Provide health education on how to make balanced- diet meals, maintain hygiene and monitor growth of their children Tirrim Church Create awareness to PLW on nutrition for the family Concern Provide porridge to the PLW World Food Programme Run a cash transfer program me 3.3.1. Weaknesses of organizations 1. Not every vulnerable person is reached by these organizations. They target certain vulnerable groups, such as pregnant and lactating mothers and children, but do not target the elderly and disabled, for example. They also do not seem to recognize that the social support system is a reciprocal one whereby the vulnerable share the aid with their kin who support them when there is no aid. 2. The services are not timely in all organizations because of organizational bureaucracy. 3. Organizations have constricted bud gets; hence, they cannot assist all those who need help. Sometimes they fail to fulfill the promises they make to communities. 4. WVI do not ask people what they want - they give Plumpy'Nut; they target only PLW and their malnourished children. Coordination among the organizations providing support (e.g. by forming a consortium or a county coordination unit) might help organizations address some of these challenges. Local governments usually coordinate such interventions, and roles are distributed across the areas of needs, such that there is no oversupply for some services and an undersupply of other services. 54 3.3.2. What are the priorities of the non -governmental organizations and county government for interventions to reduce malnutrition? Table 3.3 Preferred interventions by organization Organization Most preferred intervention World Vision International Provision of Plumpy'Nut and porridge and health education, which keeps children healthy.

Data were collected in late July and early August 2019, during the peak of the dry season. Climatic shocks are the main threats to the livelihoods of these communities. The main coping strategy is migration of livestock to areas with better pasture and, more recently, the development of grazing plans (Northern Rangeland s Trust [NRT], 2016 -2020). The climatic condition was more austere than in the same months the previous year and may have caused interview respondents to overemphasize the hardships more than if the study had been conducted after the rains (e.g. in November). The early warning bulletin for Marsabit indicated that in the current year, signs of decline in forage and milk began to show in February 2019, and the situation was labelled \"alert\" (NDMA, February 2019). If it rains normally, the condition will norma lize, but if it does not, the looming drought will occur. Other NDMA bulletins (February and July 2018) indicated that July is normally dry, with the drought intensity being determined by the short rains and 1 - or 2-day rainy episodes in the dry spell. According to key informants, the last rains (short rains, in March and April of 2019) were not adequate, and the 1 - or 2-day rainy episodes had not happened in the study area prior to the study period. The informants indicated that July 2019 was drier than July 2018. In 2019, most livestock had moved to Samburu County, which received better rains, and in some cases to Laikipia County. The fate of this community, in terms of hunger and loss of body condition, is likely to improve if the long rains fall in time and in adequate quantities. The government and partners should, however, prepare for a drought, which is likely. Politically, the study was conducted about a month prior to the national census week. Prior to data collection, the Rendille leaders had held meetings with communities to advise them not to identify as Samburu-speaking Ariaal, as it is important that the Marsabit dominant population remains Rendille (Jitewa and Bursuna personal communication, August 2019). This is important for the political survival of the existing constituencies in the backdrop of the National Executive's effort to correct historical gerrymandering of constituencies by past leadership for selfish political gain. The current discourse in Parliament, and indeed nationally, is to have a true representation of the nation's population to allow for fair political and other representation, including distribution of resources from the National Treasury. To support this, the August 2019 Kenyan census was conducted electronically, which is expected to reduce the extent of interference with data for selfish political and economic gain. To continue existing, constituencies are expected to meet a certain population threshold. Constituencies not meeting the threshold will be merged, and each m erger will reduce the number of leaders and the monetary allocation from the Treasury. In the case of Marsabit County, fragmentation of the population into multiple ethnic identities poses a political threat to the Rendille, indigenous to Marsabit. The Ariaal must therefore assume the [bilingual] Rendille identity. Initially, this new identity threw off the conceptual 58 Rendille/Samburu categories planned in this study, but after consultations with other stakeholders, we agreed to stick to this dichotomy. Studies on ethnic identity in Marsabit County have demonstrated a complexity that challenges the use of language as a marker for ethnic identity. In fact, past studies have demonstrated that the Rendille of Marsabit attributed no importance to language as a matter and symbol of collective identity (Schlee and Schlee, 2014). Schlee and Schlee (2015) predicted a change to this lack of importance motivated by political developments like the Rendille night, complete with printed T-shirts, held in Nairobi in 2012. The complexity of language as an identifying characteristic has been described (Schlee and Schlee 2014 and Schlee and Schlee 2015). Depending on where they are located, both the Rendille and Samburu will speak the other's language. and it is not uncommon for them to speak additional languages such as Somali and Turkana. These authors suggest alternate ways of identifying ethnicity - such as by identifying the circumcision age set one belongs to (the Samburu one comes a year before the Rendille one). Related to that, one can also identify the name of the circumcision ceremony one went through, which can be Muratare conducted by an Lmuratani or a Lakitoni for a Samburu and Khandi performed by a Tubcha for a Rendille (Lyamyam and Jitewa, personal communication , 2019). Whether a person participated in a Lmuget or Galgulam ceremony demonstrates whether they are ethnically affiliated to the Samburu or Rendille, respectively (Schlee and Schlee, 2015). Conducting an ethnography of the communities in Marsabit requires much preparation and consideration. These identities are further complicated by transitions and transformations into contemporary cultures such as conversion to Christianity and divorce. Christians do not have a nabo and do not perform the Almatho ceremony or Sorio rituals; what ethnic or clan identity do children born to a single \\ / \\divorced/ separated women claim? (Schlee and Schlee, 2015). In this study, we observed that there seemed to be very few indigenous Samburu -only speakers in the sites we had allocated for Samburu (Olturot, Lontolio, Laisamis and Loglogo). In line with the Maleko community conservancy management and community development plan (NRT, 2016-2020), the study area is inhabited by indigenous Rendille and bilingual Samburu- and-Rendille -speaking communities arising from intermarriages between Samburu and Rendille - probably those referred to as Ariaal in the literature. We therefore compared this group with the indigenous Rendille. Objective 1. Livelihood strategies The key informants and focus group discussants from the Rendille and the bilingual Samburu and Rendille speakers closely affiliated with the Samburu mainly characterized communities into three wealth groups: rich, middle and poor. A small number of key informants also characterized communities into two groups: rich and poor. The rich constitute the smallest proportion of the population at 15-21 percent; those of middle wealth make up 25 -32 percent; and the poor constitute the largest proportion at 51 -54 pe rcent significant community agreement in these ratios of these categories of community. Among the rich, men mainly depend on livestock and meat sales and women on milk, ghee and animal 59 fat, and less frequently on meat sales. Among the middle wealth group, men distribute their livelihood options between working as herders or construction labourers for the rich and selling livestock and meat, and women work as domestic labourers. Among the poor, women and men work as labourers and sell products extracted from nature - firewood, charcoal, wild herbs, gum resins, and so forth. The poor also beg from or simply live off their wealthier kin. Gender roles among the poor are not as clearly delineated as those for the rich. This finding is in line with the finding tha t among the Somali of Mandera, gender roles are more clearly defined among the sedentary, economically active, urban -dwelling Somalis than among the rural herders with hardly any economic activity (Waithanji, 2008). A few remittances associated with the educated children of the rich were reported in the discussions, where the issue of unemployed, educated youth was also discussed. Other than casual labour, there are few employment opportunities with the government and NGOs (NRT, 2016- 2020). The rich and mi ddle- level wealth groups owned varying numbers of camels, cattle, goats, sheep and donkeys, but these numbers often dwindled for the poor, sometimes to zero (Table 1.3). The PE exercise established that the poor were mainly without livestock and worked as labourers for the rich and middle groups. Most of the poor got their livestock as wages from labourer jobs. The poor may build their own herds in this way, but most often the livestock earned from wage labour are sold for subsistence. Male and female PE respondents from the Rendille community stated that among the Rendille, the camel was the most dominant livestock species for the rich, constituting 32 to 33 percent, followed by sheep, constituting 20 to 28 percent (Table 1.3b). Both genders from the bilingual speakers indicated that for the Samburu, the goat is the most dominant species, constituting 24 to 31 percent of the herds belonging to the rich. For the rich Samburu, sheep species constituted a marginally higher proportion of the livestock than camel s. For both Rendille and Samburu, cattle constituted a smaller proportion of the herd than camels, sheep and goats, and for the rich, they constituted 14 percent of Rendille herds and up to 19 percent of the bilingual speakers' herds. Claims about distribu tion of livestock species in the Rendille middle wealth group varied between women and men from this community, with women stating that the goat species were more prominent and constituted 36 percent, whereas men indicated that sheep were more prominent, constituting 41 percent of their herd. Both gender bilingual speakers indicated goats to be the prominent species of herds belonging to the middle wealth group (Table 1.3b). Owing to their remarkable abilities to exploit very limited resources, especially water, and their having the longest lactation period of any livestock species, camels are often the most valuable livestock species in dryland Africa (El -Agamy, 2006). Sheep and goats constitute the most widespread livestock species raised by pastoralists worldwide, for the following reasons: Goats are particularly drought resistant and can continue to supply some milk for human consumption throughout a dry season. They multip ly faster than large livestock and produce more milk through a longer lactation period than that of sheep (Degen, 2007). Male and female FGD discussants 60 in Korr stated that the one or two milking goats or sheep left behind to produce milk for the household can live off leftover human food or part of the human food. Cattle produce relatively high volumes of milk, but their need for more water at a higher frequency than other species causes them to dry up faster and hence makes them less desirable than other species (Sadler et al., 2009). A key animal product mentioned often by both communities is blood. Blood is consumed during migration in the dry season due to scarcity of food and when animals are at home during the wet season. It is food for everyone exce pt young children. About 0.5 -1 litre of blood is drawn from an animal's jugular vein about once a month, at most. Goat or sheep meat is available to all household members during each of the four Sorio (March, April, August, and September), and sick animals are slaughtered for meat before they die. In the dry season, most community members live on cereals (maize and beans) and bulky starches like maize meal ( Ugali) and rice. In the dry season, the better off community members still access meat and milk, which they buy in small quantities from the market. Other common foods are Ugali and cabbage, which are sometimes eaten together. Ugali is also a common accompaniment of milk and meat. Githeri , a mixture of maize and beans, is common evening food in the dry season. Beans are also eaten often. Long -life liquid milk and milk powder exist in the market and are sourced from both Kenya and Ethiopia. In the dry season, there is a little relief food available. Most of the relief food received is sorghum. Some relief food is targeted at the poorer segments of community, but the poor share it with their better off kin who support them when there is no relief food. In recognition of this kinship support mechanism, some organizations target all wealth groups with relief fo od. Relief food is never adequate to support all the hungry community members, but it helps reduce severe malnutrition. Food types and sources were almost constant across wealth groups, but the rich and middle groups had greater access to animal -source foods than the poor. The rich had an adequate supply in terms of quality and quantity of most foods year -round, while the middle had food deficits and were hungry during the dry season. The poor had a deficit year -round and suffered acute and chronic malnutri tion. The data is presented in Table 1.4.a . and in the word clouds in Figures 1.3.a. to 1.3. c., depicting the relative proportion of food consumed in a normal year by people from the different wealth groups. Milk is the main food constituent of the rich, according to men and women from the Rendille and bilingual respondents. The key livestock on which the Rendille and bilingual speakers rely for milk are camels, goats, sheep and cattle. Data from proportional piling of the milk sources (Table 1.4.b.) showed that 68.5 to 73 percent of the milk is sourced from livestock or shared from kinsmen who own livestock, while 27 to 31.5 percent is sourced from the shops. Middle and poor wealth groups rely more on cereals than milk. Further, the poor consume large amounts of black tea, because it is cheap to make and the main ingredient, sugar, provides quick energy. Discussions also revealed that a strong kinship support mechanism exists. The better off community members are obliged to support the worse off members. Such consideration is demonstrated when apportioning milk - there is always a 61 ration set aside for the poor. During traditional ceremonies such as Sorio, the rich give a goat or sheep to the poor to slaughter for their households. In return, the poor and malnourished who are targeted with relief food and food supplements share them with those who ar e considered more fortunate in society but who have eroded their coping strategies supporting the poor. Studies of pastoral production systems show that, in spite of the importance of animal-source foods among pastoralists, their consumption has declined and been replaced with grains and sugar. Currently, it would be difficult for pastoralists to subsist without grains and sugar. This shift is attributed to a decrease in livestock productivity and a shift from a subsistence milk -surplus system to a sale or commercial live-animal system (Abdullahi, 1993; Fratkin, 2001). Milk alone is a good source of many micronutrients, and as a result, micronutrient deficiencies are rare among pastoralist populations that consume large amounts of milk along with other food s (Fratkin et al. , 1999). Milk, however, contains minimal quantities of iron, folic acid and niacin, and milk -consuming pastoralist populations may be at risk of deficiency of these micronutrients. Deficiencies in iron and folic acid cause anaemia, which has been commonly noted in studies of pastoralist populations (Sadler et al., 2009). Iron -deficiency anaemia has been noted to be high among the Rendille pastoralists and higher among sedentary Rendille (Fratkin et al., 1999). While looking at anaemia, it is important to note that there are other pathological causes of anaemia, such as malaria and hookworm, present in many pastoral settings (Schelling et al., 2005; Save the Children -UK, 2007, as cited in Sadler et al., 2009). Low consumption of fruits and vegetables is common among pastoralist populations. This puts them at risk of vitamin A and vitamin C deficiencies where milk (particularly camel milk) is not consumed in sufficient quantities to meet requirements (Zinsstag et al., 2002). Scholars may concl ude that the nutritional status of pastoralists appears to be relatively well protected against short -term declines in food availability (i.e. during seasonal changes in milk and food availability) and recovers more quickly after a dry season than that of their agrarian neighbors (Sadler et al., 2009). They may also conclude that those groups that keep higher numbers of camels and have maintained strong social networks that emphasize food sharing (e.g. the Ariaal and Rendille) are more protected in drought than groups that rely more on cows and small livestock and that do not have such a strong culture of \"social protection\" (e.g. those in south Turkana and some Somali ethnic groups; Roth et al., 2003). However, this apparent resilience of pastoralists again st normal seasonal changes in food availability is deceptive, because it fails to demonstrate the danger that lies in successive droughts over a number of years, which can lead to quick destitution of these apparently resilient pastoralists (Chotard et al., 2006; Sadler et al., 2009). Livestock diseases and management The Rendille community has borrowed heavily from the Samburu disease lexicon. Most Samburu disease names are used interchangeably between the Rendille and Samburu. However, some diseases possess distinct Rendille names (Tables 1.5.a. and 1.5.b.). The two commonly mentioned camel diseases among the Samburu 62 and Rendille were Foot and mouth disease (Lgulup) was the disease most frequently mentioned by men and women from both communities as affecting cattle, as well as contagious caprine pleuropneumonia ( coenurosis (Sirgo ) of the most common diseases ( hemorrhagic septicaemia, foot and mouth disease and contagious caprine pleuropneumonia) are highly contagious. Two of these, h emorrhagic septicaemia and foot and mouth disease, can be controlled through diligent va ccination. There is no vaccine against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia in the market. The other three diseases (trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis [heartwater]) are vector -borne and can be controlled through vector control. The very nature of pastoralism undermines control of these diseases because of the movement of animals through vast terrain, some of which is contaminated with microorganisms and vectors, and the inability to implement or enforce quarantine in case of an outbreak and during vaccination. Pastoralism and the livestock sector in general are politically neglected in most countries. To control the diseases identified by these two communities, a country is required to have, at the very least, a legislative and regulatory framework, cross-border agreements, research, and research -informed intervention (Idriss and Nersy, 2017). Owing to their magnitude, such program mes can only be funded and/or coordinated by governments. In addition to governments having the political will to lead such projects, the funding requirements for livestock disease control in pastoral program mes are high. There remains a disconnect in these two crucial areas, but this may end if the renewed commitment to donor funding is sustained, like the EUR 980 million pastoral livestock support projects, of which livestock health is 20 percent (Idriss and Nersy, 2017). Still undermining this new initiative is the fact that Views on the future of pastoralism are deeply divided between countries where livestock production is predominantly pastoral, which consider that this activity should be maintained at all costs; and countries less involved and are often host countries of pastoral herds, which consider that, in the best of cases, it can only be perpetuated. (Idris s and Nersy, 2017, p. 2) Seasonal activities The Laisamis subcounty ecosystem is too dry to support any cropping activities, and the main livestock activity is transhumant pastoralism from permanent settlements. The pastoralists do not migrate permanently , except for some families who may change the location of their boma (kraal), rather than relocate to another place, during some circumcision ceremonies. According to the Rendille, the seasons of the year are constituted by four main components, namely the short dry season (January -March), short rains (mid -March- mid-May), long dry season 63 (June- mid-October) and long rains (October -December). The Samburu have the same seasons but add another component: the sparse rains that occur in or before September. Lives tock migrates in the dry season. For normal dry spells (see seasonal calendar), the animals move a distance of 50 km or less - for example, in Olturot, the livestock move around Mt Kulal (Figure 1). When there is a drought, livestock moves a long way into Samburu and Laikipia counties. The livestock migration patterns in relation to the season are depicted graphically in Figures 1.6.a., 1.6.b., 1.6.c. and 1.6.d. At the peak of the long dry season, and more specifically in July and August, and at the peak of short dry season in February, lactating herds used at home may dry up and migrate from the villages. Milk production peaks soon after the onset of rains (Figure 17.1 .a.-d.). Within the seasons, there are phenomena that take place, including the first and second Sorio in the short rainy season and the third and fourth Sorio in the long dry season. Of importance too is that childhood diseases, malnutrition and hunger peak in the months of July and August. This is also true for PLW, who are most vulnerable i n this period. Almotho , the milk thanksgiving ceremony, is celebrated in the rainy season of a good year. In the drought years, it is skipped, but the ceremony is repeated once normal weather conditions resume. Men's and women's work activities across the seasons The workload can be measured in terms of hours worked or of the physical exertion involved in doing work. In the dry season, young men from both communities work long, hard hours looking for pasture and water, and herding and guarding the animals against rustlers. Rustling increases in the dry season. Women, who are left in the settlements, work shorter hours and sleep longer (Figure 1.8.g.) but do more taxing chores than in the rainy season, where they work more hours and sleep for shorter periods (Figure 1.8.g.). Dry season activities for women include walking long distances in search of water and firewood as well as working as casual labourers for the wealthy. A comparison of the women's work calendar with that of men was done and plotted along t he rainfall pattern for both Rendille - speaking and bilingual respondents (Figures 1.8.a., 1.8.b., 1.8.c. and 1.8.d.) and for Rendille men and women (Figures 1.8.e. and 1.8.f.). Men do mainly productive chores and rest more hours than women, whereas women p erform productive and reproductive activities in both communities. Women's rest times are associated with activities like eating, doing beadwork and waiting for the men to complete their livestock activities so that they provide them with food. There are t wo categories of men: the young warriors who do all the work and the older men who own the livestock and stay at home with unclear daily activities. A study on gender roles by Fratkin and Smith (1995) revealed that women spent 36.7 percent of their observed daytime activities in household tasks (cooking, childcare), while married men spent only 7.2 percent of their day in these tasks. Adult men spent 33 percent of their time in livestock tasks, and married women spent 14 percent of their day with animals, mainly in milking tasks but also herding small stock and caring for nursing livestock. Adolescent boys and members of the warrior age grade spent 83 percent and 71 percent of their time, respectively, in 64 livestock -related tasks (mainly herding), while adolescent girls spent 44 percent of their time with livestock. When women were not engaged in household or livestock tasks, they spent 14 percent of their time manufacturing household goods, compared to men who were observed spending only 2.3 percent of their time on these tasks. Women have significantly less rest or leisure time than the men in the pastoral community, with women spending 35 percent of their daytime hours resting, compared to men, who spend 52.4 percent of their day in rest or leisure activities, such as playing the mbao board game in the men's shade area outside the village (Fratkin and Smith, 1995). In this study, men from Korr indicated that they did not rest at all during their awake time in the dry season but spent 89 percent of their awake time herding and the remaining 10 percent of the time milking and eating. Women from the same location indicated that they rested during 17 percent of their awake time and spent the remaining time milking (7 percent), eating (7 percent), cooking (25 percent), and fetching water and firewood (37 percent). These women did not consider chores such as childcare and household duties such as washing clothes and dishes as work and did not, therefore, account for time spent doing them. In the rainy season, women added a host of livestock -related productive and reproductive chores to the chores reported in the dry season. Time spent fetching water decreased in the rainy season, but fetching firewood took the same duration. The foregoing data demonstrates the need to break down hours worked into specific activities and categories of activities to give an accurate picture of hours worked as well as number and types of chores accomplished while working. The women's workload was heavy, especially in the dry season, and two incidents seemed to suggest that some men do not understand the burden the women bear. In a FGD with Rendille men in Korr, when doing the activity calendar, one man stated that women seemed to \"like having a lot of work.\" This was in response to the facilitator's question as to why men have only three activities in their dry season calendar while women have six. At another FGD, some women from a group in Kargi stated that in the dry season, their husbands al lowed them to fetch water with the donkeys in the morning, but denied them permission to use donkeys to transport the firewood they fetched in the afternoon, because \"this would tire the donkeys.\" In conclusion, women from both communities have a heavier workload in the rainy and dry seasons, but in the rainy season, they have enough food and are able to stay healthy. In the dry season, they do not have enough food and are malnourished or chronically hungry. Women from both the Rendille and bilingual commun ities attributed being thin and malnourished to this heavy workload. Objective 2. Access and control of milk Irrespective of who milks, all milk is given to the female head of household or wife of the household head for allocation. Milk is available to women and children during the rainy season and early dry season, when there is adequate pasture and animals are herded in or near the villages. In the dry season, when there are no milking animals in or close to the villages, availability of money to the women to buy long -life milk or milk powder determines if women and children have access to 65 milk. The fact that it is a traditional gender role for women to allocate all the milk in the household is the greatest determinant of access to milk by women and child ren. The average proportions of milk allocation by women from both communities were as follows: morans (warriors), 33.5 percent; children, 26.5 percent; husbands, 20.5 percent; needy relatives, 13.5 percent; and the women themselves, 6 percent. Although pastoral women are the primary food managers of the households, when food is scarce, they allocate nutrient -dense food to adult men and children, while the women consume the lower -calorie staple foods because of their low status in the intra-household food a ccess hierarchy (Galvin, 1985, as cited in Shell- Duncan and Yung, 2004). Consequently, women are often vulnerable to dietary deficiencies (Shell-Duncan and Yung, 2004). Favoring of children by mothers allocating milk has been documented before (Barasa et al., 2008). There is a common understanding among women in the community that children tend to get milk in their friends' homes when they visit each other as they play in the day. This cultural norm makes it difficult to account for how much milk children drink (Sadler et al., 2009). From the study sample, only one out of 24 women FGDs had respondents claiming to have sold 5 percent of the milk. The rest did not sell any milk. This preference to share surplus milk with needy kin over selling demonstrates the strong kinship ties in these two ethnic communities as an investment in future social insurance (Sadler et al., 2009). Communities that keep larger numbers of camels and have maintained strong social networks that emphasize food sharing, such as the Ariaa l and Rendille, demonstrate more resilience to drought than communities that rely more on cows and small livestock and lack a strong culture of \"social protection,\" like south Turkana and some Somali (Roth et al., 2003). The term \"surplus milk\" might be misleading, considering that the women themselves say that the milk is never enough. Findings from a study of sedentarized Ariaal women suggest that women's milk marketing activities arose from poverty and desperate need, rather than from opportunity. The women sold household milk supplies, not surplus milk, and the sale brought relatively few earnings (Mitchell, 1999). Women adjusted the amount of milk they allocated to themselves to up to 10 percent when pregnant (but allocated as low as 0 percent if they d id not want milk during the pregnancy) and to 13 -20 percent when lactating. The extra milk was taken from all other categories. Sometimes PLW accompany migrating livestock in order to access milk if they are not going too far from the villages. At other times, a camel and/or a few goats are left behind during animal movement so that they provide milk for mothers and children. This flexibility in herding patterns also determines women's access to milk. In addition to milk, women and other household members c an access meat during the four compulsory Sorio ceremonies observed by both ethnic communities; they also access milk during the Almatho ceremony. Other ceremonies such as Muratare and Mayan among the Samburu and Khandi for the Rendille are too far apart t o make a difference in women's and children's nutrition. 66 The peaks of child malnutrition and the associated indicators As demonstrated by curves in Figures 2.1.a.i. and 2.1.a.ii., child malnutrition spikes first, and then diseases spike in the months of July and August, which are considered the harshest months in terms of drought, cold/winds, and shortage of food. Seasons, therefore, affect both nutrition and health directly. Malnutrition makes children vulnerable to disease, and disease comes with the loss of appetite, which, if it lasts long enough, can cause malnutrition. Malaria prevalence is likely to increase with the onset of rains, when the mosquito population increases. Malnutrition in PLW follows the same pattern and peaks in July and August (Figure 2.1.a.iii.). The birth curve showed a distinct high spike in March/April and a slight spike in July and August at the time of peak stress, followed by another rise towards the month of December (Figure 2.1.b.iii.). The only explanation for the distinc t spike in births in March to May is the following statement by Laisamis women focus group discussants: Some women plan to get pregnant at a time when birthing will coincide with the rainy season, when there is plenty of milk and livestock to be slaughter ed. These women, however, go through a very hard third trimester of pregnancy, when it is very dry and there is hardly any food. It appears that the women go through the third trimester between January and May, rather than the July to September period. By the time they get to the July-September drought, their body condition and that of their children is still good enough to endure the drought and hunger associated with the very high levels of malnutrition in that period. The spike in births in August could be the outcome of enhanced sexual activity and weaning of children done after the onset of the rains in October and November, and the higher spike in births in December may be associated with the return of men from the short dry season grazing in March/Ap ril. Causes of malnutrition According to the PE scores, the two greatest causes of malnutrition in Rendille children and PLW were women's labour followed by human disease. For the bilingual speakers' children and PLW, the greatest causes were lack of their own milk followed by women' s labour. Among the FGDs, women identified the two causes of malnutrition in women. The first cause they identified was inadequate food, which they associated with the prolonged droughts resulting from erratic rains because of climate change. Women's heavy workload is a second major cause of their poor nutritional status, because they are always too busy and then too tired to eat well, especially during pregnancy and lactation. Female focus group discussants from both the Rendille and bilingual Samburu -speaking categories stated that most children affected by severe malnutrition are below 60 months of age. Rendille female focus group discussants indicated that they had observed that boys of all ages were more vulnerable than girls and became more malnourished, in line with some recent research in Marsabit (Bauer and Mburu, 2017). Contrary 67 to this, women from bilingual Samburu- speaking groups stated that there was no difference in malnutrition between boys and girls. The healthy poor and malnourished poor eat different quantities of similar foods. The comparison revealed that children from rich households had adequate amounts of a wide variety of food types, and the poor had limited quantities of a narrower spectrum of food types than the rich (Figure 2.4.a. and 2.4.b.). A female Rendille focus group discussant in Korr stated, \"The rich have a variety of meals to choose from, unlike the poor person who takes what's available.\" Similarly, a bilingual female Samburu -speaking focus group discussant from Laisamis stated, \"The rich can afford adequate quantities of different food types to feed their children, which the poor cannot.\" The main cause of malnutrition in PLW is poor access to foods of good nutritional value. The poor suffering from malnutrition also lack milk, soup and meat. Other causes of malnutrition are nausea and pickiness (in pregnant women only), inability to afford the food they would like to eat because they are too poor, ignorance (e.g. food taboos), overworking, withdrawal of support from husband as a result of falling out with him, and a large family leading to competition for food. Figure 2.5.2.a. summarizes the causes of malnutrition for PLW. Approximately 20 percent of the children in Marsabit are malnourished (determined by MUAC; Bauer and Mburu, 2017). For children, low milk production by the mother because of lack of food or poor feeding during and immediately after pregnancy is a major cause of malnutrition in children from poor families. Maternal depletion syndrome, defined as a broad p attern of maternal malnutrition resulting from combined effects of dietary inadequacy, heavy workloads, and energy costs of repeated rounds of reproduction - pregnancies and lactations - has been determined to be an important predictor of child malnutritio n (Shell- Duncan and Yung, 2004). Although parity of the women was not investigated in this study, maternal depletion syndrome appears to be a major driver of child malnutrition in the study area. The pastoral women from both communities do not exclusively breastfeed children from birth but supplement with camel milk. The main reason given by FGD participants for complementing breast milk with camel milk from birth was because they believed camel milk cleansed the baby from meconium and made the child strong er. Rendille and Ariaal women believe their milk is not adequate for the child (Beaman, 1981). Pregnant women have been known to consume restricted diets in the belief that they will have an easier delivery, but this results in low birth weight, estimated at 13 percent among some pastoral groups (Wayua, 2017). In the group studied, maternal depletion syndrome might be explained in Figure 4 below. 68 Figure 4. Causal pattern of maternal depletion syndrome in study sample (fora = the dry season grazing livestock camps) Children's diseases Ranking of children's diseases varied by FGD and made it difficult to establish which was the most common children's disease (Table 2.8.1.), but other scholars have identified upper respiratory tract infections as the most c ommon (61 percent), followed by diarrhoea (24.5 percent; Galgallo, 2017). Malaria is also considered to be common (Wayua, 2017). Figure 2.8.e. appears to support this claim, and URT could have exceeded diarrhoea if all the respiratory conditions listed the re were combined. A causal relationship between diseases and malnutrition was hard to specify. For example, malaria seems to peak in the rainy season. Some coughs and diarrhoea occur in the rainy and dry season, and fevers occur whenever there is an illnes s rather than during a specific season. All other diseases - common cold, pneumonia and vomiting in children, and anaemia, pneumonia, and headaches in PLW - occur in the dry, cold season (July, August and September). 69 Objective 3. Community perspectives Traditional practices for minimizing malnutrition given by men and women from the gender and ethnicity disaggregated FGDs drew strictly on the livestock resources, whereas current practices depend mostly on imported modern [foreign] remedies like Plumpy'Nut and nutrient -dense porridge for children and nutrient - dense porridge for women and their families (Table 3.1). These products are not sustainable, and the quantities available reduce acute and severe malnutrition while leaving other household members chronically hungry. From a nutrition study report from Maikona Ward, factors that negatively and significantly affected the nutrition of children included low food diversity scores ( p = 0.046); poor nutrition knowledge ( p = 0.045); lack of continuous breastfeeding ( p = 0.023); and lack or poor consumption of vitamin A -rich fruits and vegetables ( p = 0.001) (Galgallo, 2017). Sociodemographic factors, morbidity status, water and sanitation/hygiene appeared to have no influence on the nutritional status of the children (ibid) . \u00a9Washington State University/Thumbi Mwangi 71 Conclusion The study reported here consists of an analysis of the seasonality of nutrition of children and PLW; of the role livestock plays in supporting this nutrition; and of the political, cultural, ecological and economic development context for children's and PLW's nutrition in Laisamis subcounty of Marsabit County, northeastern Kenya. The study was conducted to inform future nutritional interventions intending to utilize the existing livestock resources to address malnutrition in the subcounty . The study was conducted at a time when the subcounty leadership was preoccupied with redefining the community's ethnocultural identity in order to maintain political relevance. Ecologically, the area is arid, and the main livelihood strategy of both communities studied was transhumant pastoralism. This livelihood is under threat from recurrent droughts, which cause the animals to stay away from human settlements for so long that the use of animals cannot be used as a source of nutritional sustenance as a source of nutritional subsistence. This change has caused the communities to sell livestock and use the money to purchase the less nutrient -dense grain -based diets. Milk is now a scarce commodity, and the little that is obtai ned is often sold at a premium price, especially by pastoralists living in close proximity to urban centers. Money earned from milk sales is almost always used to buy grain -based food, sugar and tea, a now popular beverage among pastoralists. Both communi ties studied were very similar culturally and economically. Wealth is distributed in three main categories, with the rich being the fewest (15-21 percent) and the poor being the majority (51 -54 percent). The middle group constitutes 25 -32 percent of the community. Generally, the rich are nourished year -round, the middle wealth group becomes chronically hungry during the dry season, and the poor are always hungry and become malnourished in the dry seasons. Current interventions to address food security in Laisamis subcounty help to keep communities alive, but with inadequate quantities of quality food. The interventions depend on products such as imported Plumpy'Nut and highly nutritious porridge, which are not locally available and are expensive. These nutrient-dense foods are therefore provided to severely malnourished children and PLW who are still capable of eating. To receive these foods, malnourished members of the community undergo rigorous screening, and those who do not qualify do not receive food. Government and NGOs provide sorghum in general or targeted relief food distributions. All these efforts, and a strong kinship support system, have managed to keep communities alive, but often hungry. The current food intervention situation can be supported with a more sustainable support system that utilizes locally available resources such as livestock. Establishing ways of returning their utility function of providing highly nutritious milk, blood, ghee, meat and animal fat could improve the nutritional status of the chronically hungry communities. To achieve this, the productivity of livestock needs to be extended. However in the current situation livestock intervention are 72 more likely to target the lactating animals that are mainly owned by the rich and middle wealth groups , who thus becom e the main beneficiaries. The rich and middle income experience the seasonal undernutrition during droughts while the poor who have few or no livestock mostly experience persistent chronic malnutrition. Whereas the loca l informants indicate that the rich and middle rich share part of their livestock production (milk and meat) with the poor, it would be of interest to track this inherent culture of sharing food and establish the impact it has on the malnutrition of the poor. In order to address the plight of the poor wealth group experiencing chronic malnutrition, livestock restocking program mes that take into account and preserve the other diverse livelihood means employed by the poor should be considered as long as such programme s do not create unnecessary labour demands or prescribe return to full time pastoralism. From the findings of this study, camels would be ideal for milk, as both these communities have traditionally kept camels for milk. Sheep milk sells at a lowe r price in the market but is more nutrient dense than goat milk and is consumed in homes more frequently. Additional livestock such as chicken, whose nutritional value to the household is unparalleled, could be introduced, but some advocacy work to address the taboo that prohibits women from eating chicken and eggs would have to be part of the package. For the livestock to be productive, interventions in animal health would have to be part of the project, whereby most common diseases such as h emorrhagic septicaemia and foot and mouth disease are vaccinated against regularly, and vectors that transmit trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis are controlled to prevent diseases from taking a toll on the livestock. The livestock disease control program me would be more effective if it was part of a larger program me coordinated on a regional or national scale, because these livestock move across large areas. Traditional remedies to prevent or address malnutrition in children and PLW are still in use today, but they are only applicable in the rainy season or until the vegetation the livestock depend upon is depleted. The applicability of such remedies was demonstrated in the coping strategy of women who plan to have children during the short rains, when there is easy access to milk, blood, meat and fat to sustain them during lactation. Program mes intervening in children's and PLW's nutrition should build upon an d take advantage of such coping strategies. For example, provision of fodder to the family milk camel to extend its lactation period into the long dry season would shorten the food shortage period that makes July and August the most dreadful months of the year. Such interventions need to pay attention to the location of the milk animal, as communities in close proximity to urban centers may sell the milk to the rich. Milk must sell at a premium in the dry season. Proceeds from milk sales, if the milk is sold by women, are used to buy grain to feed the family, and the amount of grain bought is likely to feed more people than if they shared the milk. It might, therefore, be helpful for this milk to be sold. The program me, however, needs to be conscious of the fact that women's commodities can change to men's commodities, and quickly, with commercialization. Once this happens, there is no guarantee that the proceeds of 73 milk sales will be used for family and kin nutrition. One key solution to forestall sales of m ilk is to have such program me incoparate a cash injection component that allows household access cash that can be used to buy other household items. Before the ideal set of interventions is agreed upon, there will be many lessons learned. Lessons from inte rventions by this project need to be documented and used to inform subsequent adjustments until the intervention that enables sustained food security (adequate quantity and quality food) is available for children, PLW, their families and kin. 75 References Abdullahi, A.A. 1993.
