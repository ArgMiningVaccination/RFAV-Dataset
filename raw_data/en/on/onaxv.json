Nature and humans are interconnected with one another and should to be treated in a holistic way. Th e location for this cancer treatment and rehabilitation center is in Knife River, Minnesota, between Duluth and Two Harbors. Th e intent of this center is to help patients connect with nature to help aid in the healing processes. Nature has long been thought of as a source that can impact our wellbeing. Exposure to nature can not only make people feel better emotionally, but physically as well. Any environment a person is exposed to has the ability to either increase or decrease stress which in turn can impact our bodies. Th e things we see, hear, or experience can aff ect our moods and how certain systems in our bodies are working. Nature can also be soothing to people, we tend to fi nd trees, plants, and water captivating which can distract us from physical discomfort. Architecture that incorporates nature can have an impact on its everyday users. Including such spaces, like healing spaces, in our healthcare system can have an infl uence on patient outcomes.

Olson, Listening Point Rachel McGinn - Th esis 2016 \"Natural Healing: Physical and Spiritual He aling (in a Powerful and Nurturing Setting)\" rachel.mcginn@ndsu.edu Page 7NARRATIVE Natural Healing: Physical and Spiritaul Healing (in a Powerful and Nurturing Setting) Every year, approximately fourteen million people are diagnosed with cancer worldwide. Of these fourteen million people, eight million will die of the disease. Th e United States alone will account for about 1,600,000 of the people who will be diagnosed and about 590,000 of the people who will lose their battle with cancer. Cancer patients oft en face diffi cult decisions, undergo intensive treatments, and deal with emotional distress. Th is thesis will examine how healing spaces in a clinical setting can infl uence the healing process of cancer patients undergoing treatment or who have been aff ected by the disease; providing a solution to incorporate both natural healing spaces and the necessary technological medical infrastructure. Long throughout history healing spaces have been used as an aid in the healing process, from the temples of ancient Greece to the Japanese Zen Garden. With modern medical technology, the use of healing spaces as a way to help in the healing process has diminished. Hospitals and clinics today don't really give off positive feelings, but rather have the tendency to feel cold, sterile, and are very institutional, which can create a stressful environment for patients. Rachel McGinn - Th esis 2016 \"Natural Healing: Physical and Spiritual He aling (in a Powerful and Nurturing Setting)\" rachel.mcginn@ndsu.eduPage 8Th e environments people are exposed to can either increase or decrease stress, which can have an impact on our bodies. Th e experience of a patient during a hospital stay can have an eff ect on the person's healing process, physically, emotionally, and psychologically. Th e stress of an unpleasant environment can cause a person to feel uneasy, sad, and helpless. Th ese feelings, in turn can elevate a person's heart rate, blood pressure, tension in the muscles, and can impact the immune system (University of Minnesota, 2014). Research has shown that exposure to nature, by either being outdoors or being able to view nature, can reduce stress, fear, and anger, as it helps increase more pleasant feelings. Research has also proven that patients tend to heal faster if they are provided a view that incorporates some feature of nature. Nature is defi ned as \"the phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations\" (Merriam-Webster). In other words, nature is the physical world and everything in it that is not made by people. People have an innate human desire to connect with nature. Providing more natural settings in a healthcare environment could help eliminate stress and aid in the healing process of cancer patients. So why is there such a disconnection between nature and the built environment, and how can this be changed? Th e healthcare system in Canada is known for being one of the best in the world. Healthcare settings in Canada try to address our innate human desire to connect with the natural environment and the necessity to still provide technologically advanced medical treatment. At the Peel Regional Cancer Centre in Mississauga, Ontario, patients were asked what their priorities would be for a new facility. Th e patients responded with: \"Our spaces should give us hope. \" When they were asked about what would give them hope, they replied: \"Something that is alive. \" (Stanwick, 2015). Rachel McGinn - Th esis 2016 \"Natural Healing: Physical and Spiritual He aling (in a Powerful and Nurturing Setting)\" rachel.mcginn@ndsu.edu Page 9Today, healthcare facilities are usually designed to be effi cient with minimal thought being put into consideration regarding the overall environment and patient experience. Th is is why I am interested in this type of typology. I want to design a space that will focus on the patients' wellbeing by creating atmospheres that can change the mood of patients in hopes of positively infl uencing the healing process. Duluth is the perfect place for designing a cancer treatment and rehabilitation center such as this. Th e shoreline of Lake Superior off ers a great opportunity for incorporating natural healing spaces, both indoor and outdoor, for patients and visitors who have been diagnosed or who have been aff ected by cancer.

It is nestled in the woodlands of the Duke Forest and is surrounded by meditation gardens. Th ey off er soothing spaces designed to relax and focus patients' senses as well as revitalize the spirit. Th e facility aimed for an inviting, nonclinical atmosphere for patients. Th e Mission of Duke IM is to approach healthcare as a holistic endeavor that embraces the mind, body, and spirit. Integrative medicine is about the relationship between the patient and healthcare provider. It uses the least invasive and most natural therapies, focusing on strengthening patients' innate healing response. Duke IM off ers patients natural healing spaces wi th the Sarah P . Duke Gardens and through the structure and materiality of the building, focusing more on the wellbeing of patients. Duda/Paine Architects describe it as a \"human-centered healthcare design. \" Th e design focused on reducing stress through environmental design in order to improve patient care as well as staff performance. Duda/Paine Architects used \"positive distractions\" in spaces that tend to cause anxiety. Th e two main waiting areas at Duke IM try to refocus patients' minds by engaging the senses. In the main waiting area, the hall is lined with a bench that faces towards a water wall and bamboo garden.

Duke IM seems to blend the interior with the exterior creating an integrative approach to healing. Th ere are three primary branches that extrude outward from behind the entry veranda that has a vaulted colonnade. As they reach out toward the Duke Forest, they simultaneously off er nature in with framed views, gardens, and fountains.Figure 11 Duke Integrative Medicine Figure 12 Duke Integrative Medicine Figure 13 Duke Integrative MedicineIntegrating nature in a healthcare facility through the design of the buildings gives the spaces a calming essence. Duba/Paine Architects incorporated nature in their design in a holistic way, creating a warm, relaxing environment for patients. Th e use of wood that is incorporated throughout the building gives the facility a more natural feel, accentuating the site in which it sits.

Th e theme for the building was Noah's Ark, which is echoed throughout the facility. Mott Children's center features refurbished port-holes from a local shipya rd, stained glass, and mosaic tile waves. Th e facility's is meeting therapy needs of infants and children, off ering a variety of facilities such as a therapy pool, computer lab, treatment room, smaller private treatment rooms, an aerobics room, a gross-motor skills room, classrooms, exam rooms, a clinical research area, a specialty skills room, and a sensory skills center. Like the Duke IM, the Mott Children's Center is primarily a wood-frame structure and provides multiple outdoor spaces and gardens. Th e Mott Children's Center is a family-focused, medically based facility located on a three acre site on the hospital campus. Th e mission of the center is to help children with special healthcare needs reach their full potential (Olson, 2002). Th e center was designed to capture the imagination and spirit of both patients and visitors. Th e metaphor of Noah's Ark is shown through the exposed curved timber and ship form of the building. Horizontal cedar siding wraps around the curved wall plays a major role in creating a non-institutional feel to the center. Th e site itself was sculpted to imitate waves forming around the ark.

Th e rehabilitation and therapy spaces features interesting views to the gardens in the front of the building with the slanted glass walls and port-holes. Th e glass wall gives the space plenty of natural daylight, while also providing shading from the sun by the slanted wall. Th is use of materiality in the Mott Children's Center is similar to the Duke IM building in the sense that it gives off a warm, calming essence. Th ey both are very focused on the overall wellbeing of patients. I feel as though that the sculpted landscape designed to imitate waves at the Mott Children's center wasn't really imperative, unlike the Duke IM building that was designed to accentuate the site, this center transformed the landscape to accentuate the building.

Th e use of materials and textures create an atmosphere that is inviting and relaxing. Th e layout of the building guarantees functionality for the medical staff and provides effi cient circulation for employees, leaving more time for patients. All patient rooms provide views to the countryside and are designed with materials that make the spaces feel more homely.

M\u00f8ller's design for the North Zealand Hospital really accentuates the design into the landscape with the organic shape of the building and the outdoor and indoor green spaces, giving the users a natural, stress free environment. Creating such spaces in healthcare facilities like his design could help in a patients healing process where it feels more of a sanctuary than an institution. M\u00f8ller also designed for the citizens of the city as well, giving the community a place to come and relax. I can defi nitely picture people using the outdoor spaces in his project. He also paid close attention to how the users of the building will move through the spaces, creating an easy way for medical staff , patients, and visitors to easily move throughout the facility. Th e glass facades make the interior feel more open and allows natural day lighting throughout the building.

Connecting architecture and nature can help aid in the healing process of patients, emotionally, physically, and psychologically. Th e case studies I looked at for this thesis relate to the ideas I have for my thesis. Each case study had similar ways of integrating nature within healthcare, illustrating common characteristics. Th ere were also some unique features in the three case studies. Duke Integrative Medicine was designed to accentuate the site with the use of a vaulted colonnade with three primary branches that appear to reach out toward the Duke Forest. Not only is the nature integrated within the facility, but the facility has been integrated within the site. Th e North Zealand Hospital also integrated the facility with the site, creating a type of sanctuary not only for patients, but the community as well. I think these two case studies both displayed how materiality of a building can give it a more natural, calming feel. Th e Mott Children's Center was unique from the other two case studies in that the architect used a metaphor to integrate nature within the facility. Noah's Ark was the inspiration behind the design. Th is is shown on the exterior of the building with the curved wood walls that form the \"ship, \" as well as on the port-hole win-dows in the rehabilitation room. Th e one thing I didn't like with this design is that the site was sculpted to form \"waves\" around the building. Th e site was sculpted to accentuate the building. I feel as though it should be the other way around where the building is designed to accentuate the site, as shown in the other two case studies.

With modern medical technology, the use of healing spaces as a way to help in the healing process has diminished. Hospitals and clinics today don't really give off positive feelings, but rather have the tendency to feel cold, sterile, and are very institutional, which can create a stressful environment for patients.Rachel McGinn - Th esis 2016 \"Natural Healing: Physical and Spiritual He aling (in a Powerful and Nurturing Setting)\" rachel.mcginn@ndsu.edu Page 43 Biophilia Biophilia fi rst defi ned in 1984 by biologist Edward Wilson in which he described humans as having an innate connection with Nature. It was later defi ned as \"a complex of weak genetic tendencies to value nature that are instrumental in human physician, material, emotional, intellectual, and moral well-being. Biophilia is rooted in human biology and evolution, it represents an argument for conserving nature based on long-term self-interest\" (Kellert S.R., 2008). Th ere is a wide range of hard and natural sciences that take part in defi ning and understanding the relationship between humans and biophilia. If biophilia is incorporated in the built environment it could cause both physical and economical benefi ts for humans. People would be able to enjoy a more holistic well-being.Rachel McGinn - Th esis 2016 \"Natural Healing: Physical and Spiritual He aling (in a Powerful and Nurturing Setting)\" rachel.mcginn@ndsu.eduPage 44 Healing Environments Th e environments people are exposed to can either increase or decrease stress, which can have an impact on our bodies. Th e experience of a patient during a hospital stay can have an eff ect on the person's healing process, physically, emo- tionally, and psychologically. Th e stress of an unpleasant environment can cause a person to feel uneasy, sad, and helpless. Th ese feelings, in turn can elevate a person's heart rate, blood pressure, tension in the muscles, and can impact the immune system (University of Minnesota, 2014).Rachel McGinn - Th esis 2016 \"Natural Healing: Physical and Spiritual He aling (in a Powerful and Nurturing Setting)\" rachel.mcginn@ndsu.edu Page 45 Designing with Nature Nature has long been thought of as a source that can impact our wellbeing. Exposure to nature can not only make people feel better emotionally, but physically as well. Any environment a person is exposed to has the ability to either increase or decrease stress which in turn can impact our bodies. Th e things we see, hear, or experience can aff ect our moods and how certain systems in our bodies are working. Nature can also be soothing to people, we tend to fi nd trees, plants, and water captivating which can distract us from physical discomfort. Architecture that incorporates nature can have an impact on its everyday users. Including such spaces, like healing spaces, in our healthcare system can have an infl uence on patient outcomes. Research has shown that exposure to nature, by either being outdoors or being able to view nature, can reduce stress, fear, and anger, as it helps increase more pleasant feelings. Research has also proven that patients tend to heal faster if they are provided a view that incorporates some feature of nature. People have an innate human desire to connect with nature. Providing more natural settings in a healthcare environment could help eliminate stress and aid in the healing process of cancer patients. So why is there such a disconnection between nature and the built environment, and how can this be changed?

Th e context of this project relates itself to Minnesota, the city of Duluth, and Lake Superior. Th is site resides in Minne- sota, but faces out towards the Wisconsin countryside, directly across the lake. Th e Minnesota/Wisconsin border is marked by both Lake Superior and the St. Louis River. Minnesota was the 32nd state to enter into the union in May of 1858 and is known for its 10,000 lakes. About 60 percent of Minnesota's population is located in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area which is the state's center for trans-portation, government, business, and education. Th e remainder of Minnesota consists of prairies in the west that have been given over for intensive agriculture research, deciduous forests in the south that have been partially cleared and settled, and the North Woods which is used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Duluth is a seaport city in Minnesota and is located in Saint Louis County. Th e Ojibwa have inhabited the Lake Superior area for well over fi ve hundred years. In the early 17th century, the fur trade came to the Great Lakes area due to the fashion for beaver hats. Later, in the 1850's, a more permanent settlement formed aft er copper mining began in the north which eventually led to iron ore mining. In 1855 the canal at Sault Ste. Marie opened, making Duluth the only port that had access to the Atlantic and Pacifi c Oceans. By the 20th century Duluth became the leading port in the United States. Currently the city has a population of about 86,238 people, making it the second largest city on Lake Superior's shore. Duluth is accessible to vessels from the Atlantic Ocean via the Great Lakes Waterway and the Saint Lawrence Seaway.Rachel McGinn - Th esis 2016 \"Natural Healing: Physical and Spiritual He aling (in a Powerful and Nurturing Setting)\" rachel.mcginn@ndsu.edu Page 47 Lake Superior Lake Superior is the world's largest freshwater lake and is the largest lake of the Great Lakes in North America. It is thought that the fi rst people who came to the Lake Superior region were the Plano, nearly 10,000 years ago. Lake Superior has been a vital link in the Great Lakes waterway, giving route for transpor-tation of iron ore, grain, and other mined and manufactured materials to and from the Atlantic Ocean. Large vessels as well as freighters transport these ma-terials across the lake. Lake Superior, however, is closed from January to March due to ice. Lake Superior has had many shipwrecks spanning over hundreds of years. One of the most famous being the SS Edmund Fitzgerald. Th e SS Edmund Fitzger- ald was also the last major shipwreck on Lake Superior. Th e ship sank about 17 miles from Whitefi sh Point during a storm on November 10th, 1975. All 29 crew members of the ship vanished as no bodies were ever found. Th e SS Edmund Fitzgerald was 729 feet long and was split in half during the wreck. Th ere is a legend of Lake Superior, in that \"she seldom gives up her dead. \" Th is is widely due to the fact that the water of Lake Superior is cold year round and bodies tend to sink and not resurface.Th ere have been over 80 diff erent species of fi sh found in Lake Superior. Many have been intentionally introduced, and many accidentally. Lake Superior has less dissolved nutrients in relation to its water volume compared to the other Great Lakes making fi sh populations signifi cantly less than the other lakes. Th is is due to Lake Superior having underdeveloped soils.
