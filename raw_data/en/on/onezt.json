Currently there are no known drugs to treat, cure or prevent the Coronavirus. Additionally, there is no available vaccine. What we do know is the WHO recognizes that recovery from any virus depends on each individual patient's immune response. Therefore, it would seem safe to presume that the best way to prevent the Coronavirus is having a properly functioning immune system. Because Coronavirus is a virus, we can use our experience with similar viruses for treatment options. Here at Nourish, we encourage our patients to support their immune system by avoiding sugar, reducing stressors, avoid smoking, and getting quality sleep. If you do feel sick, stay home and rest. How is the Coronavirus Transmitted? Coronavirus can be transmitted from respiratory droplets Coronavirus can be transferred through the fecal-oral route The Corona Virus (COVID-19) can shed for up to 14 days AFTER the patient is no longer symptomatic. Reinfection can occur and cases of reinfection have been observed in China From preliminary reports the virus can only last for a few hours (not days) on surface but this information has yet to be officially confirmed by the CDC. What are the symptoms of Coronavirus? The sequence of symptoms have been reported as a cough, followed by shortness of breath that increasingly gets worse over the next 3-7 days. It is also accompanied by fever much higher than you would see with the flu and can range as high 102 to 104. Symptoms can include body aches and pains like influenza, however some who have tested positive for the virus have reported having no symptoms at all. An individuals symptoms and timeline will vary depending on their state of health. The symptoms of Coronavirus are similar to the symptoms of the Flu Virus: Coronavirus: cough, shortness of breath and fever. Influenza (Flu): fatigue, muscle aches and fever What are some nutrients that are proven to strengthen immune function? Vitamin C Vitamin C is one of the most well-known and researched vitamins that exists. Researchers at the University of California had participants of a research study take approximately 500 mg of Vitamin C supplements per day and identified that there was a decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels after two months. CRP is a lab marker used to identify the presence of inflammation in the body. Increasing levels of Vitamin C in your diet may be helpful in reducing inflammation your body. Natural sources of Vitamin C: oranges, lemon, limes, mangos and, papaya, Brussels sprouts, broccoli and strawberries Vitamin D Vitamin D is essential to Researchers from Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, New York found after giving Vitamin D to a group of volunteers that they experienced reduced episodes of infection with colds and flu. It was evident that Vitamin D stimulates the innate immune response, which is how our body is able to fight off viruses and bacteria. Natural sources of Vitamin D: sunlight, fish oils, mackerel, halibut, salmon, sardines, tuna, dairy products, eggs, butter, oatmeal, shitake mushrooms, dandelion greens and sweet potatoes Selenium Selenium is a mineral that has a role in immunity and detoxification processes of the body. According to research reviewed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements, Selenium levels are often low in people living with HIV, possibly because of inadequate intakes or excessive losses due to malabsorption and diarrhea. Clinical trials of selenium supplementation in adults with HIV have found that selenium supplementation can reduce the risk of hospitalization and prevent increases of HIV-1 viral load. When the viral load of any virus halted or decreased, it can lead to an increase number of CD4 white blood cells that help fight off any viral infections. Natural sources of Selenium: brazil nuts, brown rice, eggs, tuna, garlic, asparagus, salmon, buckwheat, crimini and shitake mushrooms Zinc Zinc is used for more than 100 different enzyme reactions in the body. It has been show in studies that Zinc deficiencies play a significant role in decreased immune function especially in the function of macrophages. Macrophages are immune cells that help to engulf and destroy viruses in our body. Making sure you have adequate levels of this vitamin is essential to having an optimal immune response Natural sources of Zinc: soybeans, peas, spinach, avocados, blackberries, beans, mushrooms, cashews, pumpkin seeds, wheat germ cooked oysters and beef 8 Hygiene Tips to Prevent the Spread of Coronavirus It is important to keep in mind that one of the best forms of prevention is avoidance and mindful hygiene! - Wash your hands with soap and water - Clean your phones and credit cards - Avoid close contact with people who are sick. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. - Stay home if you are sick, except to receive medical care. - Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. - If you used a tissue to cover, immediately throw it away and wash your hands. - Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces you touch.
