We will begin our hearings this morning with Dr. Irving Ladimer, director of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Division of the National Better Business Bureau, Inc., and Vice President too, of the organiza- tion. Dr. Ladimer was with us yesterday. We certainly appreciate his staying over to be with us this morning. STATEMENT OF IRVING LADIMER, VICE PRESIDENT AND DIREC- TOR, FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC DIVISION, NATIONAL BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU, INC. Dr. LADDiER. I will get down to business as quickly as possible, because we have a number of very important matters to discuss.I represent the National Better Business Bureau, Inc., and am vice president in charge of the food, drug, and cosmetic division. In addition, I have been a consultant on problems of the aging when I was a Federal employee, as well as for the State and the city of New York and several voluntary and social agencies. This is the second time that the bureau has had the privilege of speaking before your committee. You may recall that our president, Mr. Kenneth B. Willson, testified on January 16, 1963, and reported on a wide field of problems involving the exploitation of our elderly citizens. Since his remarks appear in your records, I shall not repeat the details of the bureau movement. I do wish to point out, however, as he did, that we believe that the great majority of American business is honest and deals in a responsible way with the public generally and with our senior population. Most advertisers go to considerable pain 259260 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY to insure the accuracv and propriety of their claims and seek to correct inaccuracies or misleading statements when called to their attention. A small minority, however, does engage in questionable or underhandpractice and it is this group which tends to defraud the public and to darken the name of American business. Better business bureaus, along with other voluntary protection groups, seek to raise standards and to develop public confidence in American industry, business, and commerce, and to assure that the consumer gets fair value for the trust which he should rightfully repose in our American system of free enterprise. From our records, it appears that the most widespread and flagrant depredations against the elderly occur in the field of health and well- being. To a great extent, however, advertising of medications, food,and health devices, and various programs to improve or maintainstrength and vigor are not outright frauds. The fact is that most products advertised and sold directly to thepublic have some worth or value. These, however, are generally lim- ited either in their effectiveness or for a particular group. Therefore, the failure or the inability of the older consumer to distinguish betweenwhat is good or pertinent, and what is not, often arises because he is not properly informed or educated. It would not be fair to say that this lack constitutes the wholeproblem. Even the highly intelligent and experienced are cheated or shortchanged. But the elderly, in general, seem to be more vul- nerable. It has been asserted that because older people are weaker or sicker and have frequently been disappointed in the health measures which they have used, they are more eager to find a new remedy, perhaps an extravagantly advertised cure or \"new discovery\" which is pre- sented as the real answer. They also, of course, seek to regain a lostyouth and, with increasing longevity, understandably wish to retain fading powers and former beauty. A review of our casework-that is, the daily roster of inquiries and complaints which we receive from consumers, from local bureaus, fromhuisinPq org nrizations, from advertisers and m^diums-indicates that most of our effort is related to nutritional preparations, both medical and dietary. The elderly are a special and large target for promoters of vitamin- mineral food supplements, diet products and programs, appetite con-trols, tonics of various sorts, and a host of so-called special foods in various forms. While it is true that many elderly people do not or cannot eat well, the Federal Food and Drug Administration has con- clusively demonstrated that the normal diet of the average American is generally sufficient. Supplementation and enrichment by vitamins or special diets should be obtained through prescription and under the supervision of a physi-cian who knows the personal condition of his patient. Yesterday I understand Commissioner Larrick spoke to you in greater detail, so I will not go into that again. Nevertheless, many promoters prey on the sense of insecurity and doubt prevalent among older people and try to sell varieties of prod- ucts on the theory of \"insurance.\" The recent court decision, the Vita8afe case, which Commissioner Larrick also mentioned, upholdsHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 261 the Federal Government in its view that the labeling for a common vitamin formulation was not, as claimed, helpful for weakness, de- pression, tension, impotence, and some 30 other conditions, nor will it stave off the natural declines of our later years. The work in bringing this particular advertiser, as we know in our Bureau, to final judgment was costly and time consuming, involving not only investigation and inspection, but the testimony of medical witnesses, psychologists, as wel as technical preparation by lawyers and administrators. We hope that this landmark case sets an example in this field. It is perhaps too early to determine whether other promoters using other names for the same type of vitamin preparations will not continue to bilk the general public and the elderly in particular. I would like to comment at this point to say that our files show that this is a fairly common situation: that old products come up with new names in different parts of the country, and even though FDA or other agencies manage to get one, they always have to be on the alert because, as I think Commissioner Larrick explained, these seizures are for the item, rather than the company or the individual. Next on our list are remedies for chronic disease and disability. Among these are devices and preparations for the relief of arthritis aches and pains, various massagers and exercise devices for the relief of the pains of rheumatism, neuralgia, bursitis, and similar conditions claimed to. help so-called nervous disorders, various baths, electrical or hydrotherapeutic devices; and, of course, clinics for cure of cancer, rheumatism, arthritis, digestive diseases, and other ailments. It is our understanding that many such clinics purporting to pro- vide special treatments for elderly sufferers are local operations adver- tised through the mail and newspapers. A typical illustration is an institute in Florida which advertises nationally as \"Miami's most na- tionally known clinic,\" which claims to cure prostate trouble without surgery, to help arthritis patients, and others. It offers free booklets, sends out a tabloid newspaper and parades a vast number of testimonials of people who presumably found help at such a clinic. Many of these clinics offer free \"services\" for initial treatments without charge. The eventual cost of care and medicine, which usually are not compensated under any reputable insurance plan, often mounts to thousands of dollars. The real crime here is that very few of these clinics, if any, are competently staffed or are supervised by a licensed physician and tend to delay application to a recognized hos- pital or skilled practitioner. Since these tend to operate locally, the powers of the Federal agen- cies, which are limited to interstate operations are greatly curtailed. It would be well to determine to what exent such operations are within the jurisdiction of the Post Office, for example, since they may be deemed to use the mails to defraud, and to what exent they could be effectively closed down through the seizure of so-called diagnostic and treatment devices which are shipped in interstate commerce and are therefore under the control of the Food and Drug Administration. More to the point, however, local authorities should be encouraged to inspect and to act promptly under the various laws available to them,262 2HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Among the more outrageous attempts to bilk the elderly are the na- tionwide mail order promotions pertaining to alleged aphrodisiac preparations, sex aids, and devices. Evidently, many promoters, es-pecially those located in the West, recently found sex was fair game,that is, among the elderly. They appeal to women with skin re- juvenators, wrinkle removers, bust builders, various types of cosmetics and reducing aids, as well as with the vitamin preparations I have mentioned. Men, however, are besieged by potency pills, drugs, various stimu-lators, and devices. One mail order firm advertised a device whichwas described as \"suitable for all sizes * * * no age limit,\" proclaim- ing that it was intended to help \"keep man's sexual ability active, andreactivate that which seems lost.\" Unhappily, we have taken a very dim view of these prospects andthe Post Office has apparently seen it the same way. Last month theDepartment sent us a list of just a few who were corraled in the Los Angeles area. These include an aphrodisiac pill labeled \"Stimurex,\" another pill labeled \"Stimulad,\" still another called Comtab and, for women, a bust developing device entitled \"Voluptuizer.\" There are any number of these devices made of plastic, rubber, andother materials in various shapes and sizes, all of which are said toaid in overcoming impotency and in improving relations. It is highly questionable whether these have significant value, par- ticularly since the consensus of medical authority holds that the causesof sexual difficulty and impotence for the most part are psychogenic ora combination of psychogenic and organic difficulties. It is, therefore, unlikely that many men will be helped by these devices. But the lim-itations are not set forth in the advertising. Among the hardy perennials, are advertisements for baldness rem- edies, even though there is no known cure for this common form of thiscondition among the elderly; hearing devices, often sold through themail or at high cost, or under high pressure by local salesmen; forelectrical and mechanical devices intended to improve circulation or relieve muscle pain; and for various types of dental aids. T1hM Amp-ripnn TDntal A-ooci-tion with which wecooer forexample, has stated that the public pays over $20 million each year tounqualified persons who operate contrary to State dental laws. Arti- ficial dentures purchased by older people from substandard and irre-sponsible practitioners or salespeople, often constitute a severe healthhazard. Many unsuspecting people are trapped by false advertisingin the hope of saving a dollar. As to hearing aids, we recently issued a simple set of instructionsto prospective purchasers, advising them how to select a reputable dealer and what to look for. The New York League for the Hardof Hearing and several local bureaus have reported that this guidancehas proved very helpful and practical. As I pointed out earlier, some of the products and devices may have genuine worth in limiting painor providing temporary relief, but all too many unscrupulous pro-moters claim far more than is scientifically possible or justified. Ourwork and that of other consumers defenders lies in presenting andcorrecting such misrepresentations. In the short time allotted to me, I would like to emphasize pro-posals for remedial action rather than to recite again the catalog ofHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 263 frauds this committee has heard so ofteon. I am attaching a speech which I delivered last month at the Anni\"ual Conference of the National Council on Aging, \"Safeguards To Combat Exploitation of Older Con- sumers\" which includes a number of illustrations indicating how older people may be misled, not only in the health area, but in other respects, which I hope you will include in the record. Senator WILLLMS. All right, we will do that. (The speech referred to is as follows:) SAFEGUARDS To COMBAT EXI'LOITATION OF OLDER CONSUMERS (By Irving Ladimer, S.J.D., vice president, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Division, National Better Business Bureau, Inc.) Recently the National Better Business Bureau received a letter from a retiredlady written in the difficult, angular handwriting which is so characteristic of older persons. In part, that letter said: \"My old home was beyond fixing, so last August a prefab home corporationbuilt me a home; and off and on I have had leaks in the cellar due to poor plumbing because the pipe was not connected right when the house was being built. I called up the foreman and asked them if they would come ove.r on the phone asking 'if they give away rowboats when they build prefab homes like mine, so they asked me if I was kidding them.' You may think it's nothing when you have to bail out water fom the cellar. My son-in-law who lives in New York City came up on his 3-week vacation. He dug a hole outside my kitchendoor and my neighbors then came and helped me fix the pipe. Now I have to have the hole opened to fix it back again. I also have two unfinished porches and the foreman promised to come back to fix them too. I have not seen anyone as yet. The wash basin they put in the bathroom was a second but was cracked when it was put in by the plumber who did the plumbing. It cost me over $800for dirt while they were still working. It seems so unfair I have to pay for the dirt, as I always thought the construction calls for everything when building a home. I hate to be taken over by a bunch of fakers.I am writing this so other people who want to build a prefab home, won't bein the same predicament as I am. I figure you can help me out of this situation as I have heard so much about the Better Business Bureau helping others outin their predicament. Anything you can help would be greatly appreciated.\" Although this is perhaps not a typical letter, it is not unusual. While we. are not always able to help out as we did in this case by getting the local Better Business Bureau to convince the contractor and plumber to make good, I feltit important to start my speech with the theme that she so well expressed: I am writing this, so other people won't be in the same predicament as I am. A NEW MARKET Fundamentally, we are gathered here to understand the plight of older people,most of whom are at a disadvantage socially, economically, and competitively, especially as consumers. With your permission, I will not recite the customary data demonstrating that well over half of the 18 million older Americans in about six and a half millionfamilies today live on subsistence and minimum fixed incomes. Generally, their money level, under $3,000 a year, provides only staples and few luxuries, but their basic needs remain. Nevertheless, it is estimated that just under 2 million families in the older-age group constitutes a $36 billion market of goods and services. An article in the January 1964, Journal of Marketing points out that this segment of the aged constitutes a new, specialized market which the seller is urged to develop and cultivate deliberately and carefully (Reinecke, John A., '\"The Older Market-Fact or Fiction,\" J. Market 28: 60-64 (January 1964)). Numerous statistics are cited, indicating expenditures, likes and dislikes of older people. They need food, clothing, shelter, medicine, among the necessities of life,and they would like to have recreation, education, opportunity for travel andeasier living arrangements, among the so-called luxuries of life. According to one study cited, \"older families are likely to purchase only a relatively small number of individual products outside of the drug category.\" At the same time, the article notes that older people, particularly, have been affected by economic stringency. 31-13\"\"6t. 3---264 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY A recent editorial in Life Magazine (Jan. 10, 1964) on automation underlines graphically what we all too well know: the older person is first and hardest hit and is less able to roll with a punch. As Life says, \"What about the Appalachian miner who is too old, or hopeless, or uneducable to learn to work a filling station in Illinois or sweep out a Florida motel? How even persuade him to leave West Virginia where he owns his home, has run up his debts and where the hay sifts along the scraped green hillsides from the porch as it has been since he was born?\" Human problems, says this editorial, should be handled in variously human terms. Long before the older person became a special target for the salesman, he was a consumer like the rest of us, open to the same opportunities which the greatest market in the world offers. He was also, regrettably, open to the same swindles, hoaxes, and exploitations which a minority of our businessmen perpetrate on an unsuspecting population. NBBB BOLE The National Better Business Bureau, as a nonprofit corporation founded by American business in 1912 to protect both itself and the public from advertising and selling practices which are misleading, deceptive, unfair or fraudulent, has had over 50 years to observe the American scene. The National Bureau, which I represent, is concerned with consumer selling methods which cover the Nation or large regional areas, whereas local bureaus, which are sponsored by local busi- ness, handle affairs in cities and smaller communities. It is our belief that the vast majority of American business is honest, that it deals fairly with the public and that responsible advertisers go to great lengths to assure the accuracy of claims before they are offered to the public. They are prompt to correct inaccu- racies and seek advice in order to avoid repetition. We are pleased that we are recognized throughout the country as an agency which develops fair business practice and which provides guidance free to business and the consumer. At the same time, we are aware that the elderly, like others, may be taken in by sharp practice. They are bilked of millions of dollars annually, not only because they are sold worthless or questionable products but because they are not sufficiently informed to be able to make proper and practical judgments. ADVERTISING IN THE HEALTH AREA AFFECTING THE AGED Kenneth B. Willson, president of the National Better Business Bureau, stated to the Special Commitee on Aging in 1963: \"Appeals to health and well-being directed to older people constitute one of the more widespread and insidious exploitations in our country today. In gen- eral, the problem lies not so much in the advertising and sale of completely worth- less products, because many of them have some limited or conditional value, but in the extravagant and colorful claims which suggest that the offerings can do much more than is seientifienlly jistified. TTnfrtunntely, in many areas, there is no established or single scientific or medical opinion, so that it is possible to trade on the argument that there may be a new discovery or the beneficial effect of a traditional or folk medicine which has been neglected or improperly applied. The problem thus often becomes one of degree, the extension of a logical or apparently reasonable theory to conditions or situations for which rigorous clinical study cannot be absolutely applied in every case.\" Old people are generally sick people. They are especially prone to buy a large variety of questionable remedies, perhaps because they have not been satisfied by recognized or conventional treatment and still look with hope, or perhaps fear, to the future. They may also be more suggestible and, in the twilight period of life, they are struck more forcefully by the all-too-human desire to stay young or to find some fountain of youth. The sophisticated promoter and the quack are still capitalizing on the infirmi- ties of the aged through the flagrant misrepresentation of pain-killing pills, drugs of various sorts, diets, and various sale-by-mail nostrums calculated to cure or alleviate conditions which require competent medical diagnosis and treatment. For example, the Arthritis & Rheumatism Foundation estimates that in excess of $250 million annually is spent on dubious remedies for the relief of arthritis, rheumatism, and other muscular ailments. While many of these are helpful for the temporary relief of pain, there is no known drug or medication which, by itself, constitutes a cure for arthritis or rheumatism. Nevertheless, only recently the Food and Drug Administration seized-a concoction of alfalfa and related herbs, compounded and propounded for years as a cure for arthritis. ThisHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 265 Is sold by mail, and despite adverse scientific testimony available for many years, the promoter has been able to continue his activity and is now delaying the evil day of final condemnation by a series of appeals to the courts. He has also had the effrontery to use as an endorser a former employee of the Federal Trade Commission whose reasons for permitting his name to be employed have not been made clear. I mention this now, although I will advert to this problem later, because all of us tend to respect authority and frequently have no way of recog- nizing the shadow from the substance. Also, as I will point out, the law may be potent but it is not always prompt. It is to be hoped that public advertising for arthritis remedies, which has been so rampant in recent years, will soon be over. Certainly, television which has been so effective a salesman in this field and in others has taken an important step. The National Association of Broadcasters, through its television code authority, has, in company with the Arthritis & Rheumatism Foundation, estab- lished standards for the advertising of such products. They state, among other things, since the exact cause has not yet been discovered and no completely satisfactory treatment has been developed for all cases, that no product may make such claims. Advertising for such products should be limited to temporary relief of minor aches and pains. Whether you, I, or our older sisters and brothers will take note of these limitations remains to be seen. Whatever other limitations may be learned, sex is evidently not one of them. NBBB files abound with promotions promising the abundance of youth. For women, there are skin youthifiers, wrinkle removers and crease covers, bust builders and, of course, cosmetics, and reducing agents as well as vitamin prep- arations. The men, however, are barraged by sex rejuvenators, potency pills and drugs and various stimulators. A mail-order ad for a device, \"suitable for all sizes * * * no age limit\" unabashedly proclaims that it \"is intended to help keep man's sexual ability active or to reactivate that which seems lost.\" Un- happily, we take a dim view of this prospect and so does the Post Office. A typical potency pill-simply a vitamin-enzyme preparation-\"Golden 50 Tabulets\" was seized by FDA last year. It was charged misbranded by bottle label and promotional material \"Facts For Folks Over 50\" for suggesting it was- \"Adequate and effective for the treatment of rundown and weak conditions; lack of energy; inability to withstand the noise of children; tiredness; lack of appetite; loss of enjoyment of life; inability to be the man or woman formerly possible; coated tongue; bleeding gums; tooth decay; sion.\" Where drugs and devices fail, evidently so-called doctors do not. Many are dosing with dubious, often dangerous, drugs, giving injections and performing operations. This biological boom, fortunately, is reserved for the rich, but the mail-order and barbershop magazine promotions are still producing thousands of packages in \"plain wrappers.\" FL ECING IS FAR FLUNG One of the most tragic aspects of this problem is its insidious spread. A recent issue of McLean's Magazine, one of Canada's national publications, carries an article with the appealing title \"The Older You Get the Harder the Crooks Go After Your Money.\" Fleecing men and women over 65 has grown into a $2.2 billion racket in the United States and Canada. The author attributes this to the fact that- \"People, particularly in countries like the United States and Canada, are living longer and retiring earlier. They are not retiring penniless, to be kept by rela- tives, as most of the old did in the past. They are retiring with pensions and- the luckier of them-with savings. They have emerged as a whole new category of consumers.\" While this is welcome news, it has been greeted in Canada, according to the article, by the same schemes devised to rook Americans, frequently by the same individuals. Old women deprive themselves of meals to buy fake beauty preparations and alleged wrinkle removing contraptions, and old men empty their pockets to buy discredited health foods. Suffering from loneliness, like their American coun-266 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY terparts, they fall prey to dancing schools. Old men are clipped by introduction bureaus. There is a light side to this, too, incidentally, since we at the NBBB were told that many well-meaning children who urged their parents to get their money back on worthless dance studio contracts have been stonily ignored by these presumed victims who are apparently happy to be taken, at an excessive cost, simply because it provides some reprieve from rejection. So we must becareful to allow a small morsel of malarkey while fighting off the more venal victimizations. Among other importations from the United States are fake medical devices, many of which were exhibited at the Second National Congress on Medical Quackery. We might think that the discredited gold and silver tractors devised by Elisha Perkins when this country was in its infancy would not reappear. Some of the exhibits I saw in Washington included a colored light projector which presumably showed different rays for different ailments. A plastic dumb- bell device containing two tubes of water, supposed to produce z-rays (obviously an improvement over X-rays) was sold to thousands of people in the Midwest for curing any number of maladies. Probably the most widespread instrument is a type of electronic console, seized by the Food and Drug Administration, mainly in chiropractors' offices, which turned out to be nothing more than a string galvanometer which simply measured the proportion of salt content of sweat. Another presumed to diagnose disease by analyzing blood, but regrettably failed to distinguish between blood from a live patient and from a corpse. The National Better Business Bureau has for many years sought to prevent or limit the advertising of so-called baldness remedies. It is unfortunate that we still cannot find a single preparation which, by itself, can truthfully be said to prevent or cure common baldness, the so-called male-pattern type. But this does not prevent scores of promoters from setting up clinics, sending out mailings, and soliciting through a series of testimonial advertisements. Like the machine that could not tell the quick from the dead, one of these so-called laboratory con- sultants assured a member of our staff that he could cure baldness on the basis of the sample of hair submitted. He was understandably upset when we told himthat it came from a pet collie dog. HOME SWEET HOME Older people are apparently particularly vulnerable to the scare technique. They are sometimes shamefully swindled in the sanctity of their own homes. NBBB President Willson notes that millions of dollars have been extracted from old people in the sale of furnaces. They are falsely told that old furnaces are dangerous and will blow up. So-called furnace salesmen, sometimes posing at the outset as inspectors, frighten old ladies into replacing working equipment with expensive installations which are neither needed nor wanted. He reports that a small band of itinerant confidence men continually prey on the gullibility of our old people. Getting entry into the home by some ruse, they scare them into authorizing repairs to roofs, chimneys, septic tanks, home wiring, and other unnecessary home repairs. Our Canadian correspondent says that the roof and chimney racket is perhaps the most prevalent throughout North America. One of the most pitiful and unscrupulous schemes is based on the urgent needfor medical and hospital protection. Although insurance is generally carefully regulated, local bureaus have reported that racket plans are offered by door- to-door salesmen, by mail, and in advertisements which are skillfully worded, so that quite literally the large print giveth and the small print taketh away. Our Los Angeles bureau states, \"This is a sensitive field, because victims are unaware when plans have been misrepresented until a need arises. Only then do they learn that the doctor and hospital services, savings on X-rays, eye- glasses, hearing aids and dental care are far more limited than expected.\" The bureau reports that the attorney general in that State has started action in several cases to try to dissolve plans to see whether insurance is being sold without a license. FREE LOTS, FUNERALS, FRANCHISES Older people, quite naturally, look for a warm peaceful, retirement haven to make their later years more comfortable. Untold millions have been and are being spent by our aging public to buy faraway lots, sight unseen. British Honduras, Brazil, Costa Rica, Venezuela, the Bahamas, and Hawaii are all represented in the farflung promotions beamed at the aged. In the UnitedHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 267 States the emphasis is on the southwestern area and Florida. It is reportedthat in Mohave County, Ariz., there are more than 300 subdivisions with hun- dreds more in New Mexico, California, Texas, Oregon, Florida, Idaho, and Utah. Some of these retirement paradises and investment opportunities- some are sold not for habitation but for speculation-are later realized only as a stick or a line in a desolate area, miles from any established community. But don't begin to think that all these land promoters are dishonest. One of these companies, selling lots, clinging to the side of a volcano, advertised: \"Buy now, before they skyrocket.\" Now, that's literally true. No one can complain about such promises. A few months ago, a husband and wife team were indicted in Abilene, Tex., on 11 counts of mail fraud. Doing business as Land Management Corp., they induced persons visiting fairs and similar events to register for \"free lots\" situated in Texas which they colorfully titled \"The Last Frontier.\" Practically all of the registrants were winners, the Post Office states, and were required to pay closing costs of $19.80, as a beginner. The land was almost worthless, according to the postal inspectors, who estimated that the victims, many of whom were oldsters, lost about $25,000. So, whether these people bought land or won land, unless they had the foresight and good sense to follow the simple rules of investigating before investing, they just put a dollar down without any reasonable chance of ever being able to build up. The NBBB has embarked on a campaign with the real estate operators to develop and abide by a program of fair-sale standards. Many States require registration similar to that for securities. But, information and good sense are still the first line of protection. The yearbook of the Department of Agriculture for 1963. A Place To Live, points out that well intentioned older people who think that living in a rural area is easy are evidently not given the simple advice to which they are entitled. The yearbook states: \"The older newcomers to farming tend to overestimate their physical ability. General opportunities for farming may seem plentiful, yet the variety of oppor- tunity is actually limited by work capacity. Old pople, for example, cannot bend their backs for long hours needed to produce, pick and pack a commercial strawberry crop. Production of vegetable and flower plants may be practical for young farmers but -transplants that are to be marketed early in the morning have to be gathered and packaged late into the night, a time when old people should be in bed.\" This problem does not present outright deception and certainly does not in- volve fraud. One might say that anyone should know better. But, if we are to exercise special concern and care for those who may not have an opportunity to know or learn, we should reach out, dissuade them from seeking for gold at the end of the rainbow, and seriously discourage them from taking steps which they may not be able to retrace. In addition, thousands of elderly people are swindled out of the few dollars they have put aside for safekeeping or investment. Older people were among the principal victims of a save-by-mail scheme operated by a number of State- chartered and privately insured savings and loan associations in Maryland during 1958-61. These associations solicited savings accounts on which they promised to pay extremely high dividend rates. New savers were also offered expensive gifts, a gimmick which is apparently on the increase with no peak in sight. Advertising also symbolized that the accounts were \"insured\" by the Security Financial Insurance Corp., which some thought to be a Government agency. Although these associations and promoters were finally brought to book, many elderly people and others have found it impossible to get any money back on demand. How much they may eventually receive is a grave question. On that note, I may remind you that, from time immemorial, older people have been the special target of various funeral and cemetery schemes. This subject has been in the public eye within recent months but, as you know, this industry has weathered attacks in the past and doubtless will continue, perhaps with some modification. While the majority of funeral directors deal fairly, even though perhaps somewhat extravagantly, reports have been received that a particular establishment has charged exorbitant fees. Many funeral directors of the renegade type ferret out information about the amount of insurance or other assets and then inflate the funeral bill to get as much as possible. In re- cent years, a number of sales organizations outside the funeral profession have sought to stimulate public interest in so-called prefuneral plans. Old folks, are, of course, prime prospects for such plans.268 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Old people who want to preserve some independence and remain usefulcitizens, often try to convert their savings and energies into profitable employ- ment. Along with the new technology in this country come new businessmethods. Perhaps one of the fastest growing is the franchise, an arrangement whereby a small investment provides the right to use the name and services of companies which are now engaged in literally thousands of different types ofenterprises. When honestly handled, the franchise can provide a businessopportunity not otherwise available. The franchisee generally sets up his own business and operates it in accordance with guidance and service provided by the franchiser. Only too often, this goodwill and help is far less than ex- pected, and the initial investment may be just the beginnnig of a series of pay- ments for a number of unexpected expenses. According to Harry Kursh, author of The Franchise Boom; How You Can Profit From It, a book very favorable to this approach, a franchise has more than its share of risks. He states: \"There is perhaps no business, no industry, no aspect of life that is entirelyfree of phonies, frauds, assorted swindlers, ingenious con men and borderland operators who walk and talk in the shadows of the law. The franchising fieldis no exception. It has its share of fast-buck wheelers and dealers. How many, nobody knows * * * I would say that franchising, perhaps because it has been mushrooming with small business opportunities, attracting the little guy, has more than its fair share of gyps.\" Franchising is attractive to oldsters but, as in the case of presumably light farming, many simply overestimate their prowess. They should be warnedagainst the all-too-probable pitfalls of self-employment, particularly if theyhave had no previous experience. A PROGRAM FOR PROTECTION A problem as vast and complex as that which I have merely illustrated callsfor a series of mutually supporting techniques of intelligence and defense. A comprehensive program for protection should consist, at least, of this fivefold structure, for which I have coined the acronym PEARL, each letter signifying one level or layer of effort. P stands for professional responsibility, E for educa- tion, A for assistance, R for regulation or restraint on a voluntary basis, and L, obviously, for law-both statutory control and the use of law in ordinary, personal actions. In essence, they correspond to series of recommendations offered by the Better Business Bureau, the Government agencies, consumer groups, and others who testified in January 1963 at hearings of the Special Senate Committee on Aging. Doubtless, similar recommendation will be presented by Senator Harrison A.Williams, chairman of one of the new subcommittees of the Committee on Aging. which held its first hearings In California, 1 year after the initial testimony on quackery in Washington. As you know, these 1964 hearings ennepntrntpd on cancer quackery, housing, employment opportunities and medical fruads gen- erally. EDUCATION I should like to start my PEARL with education. Clearly, in a country such as ours, where literacy is high and communication is available and reasonably inexpensive, the most important approach must be the meaningful indoctrina- tion of the consumer in ways which will alert him to the problems of the market- place and teach him how to cope with them. Although I have great respect for public education, I am also aware of its limitations. I am not impressed with what we, as a Nation, have so far done in the field of consumer education, despite the great efforts expended by the Government, the voluntary agencies, by schools, by industry, and by organizations such as our own. Our tendency is to write and distribute pamphlets and booklets and to assume that if these are read and perhaps understood, they will help prevent some of the depredations and ex- ploitations which I have described. No doubt some of these have been highly successful, but I daresay none of them has oriented the consumer the way \"In-fant Care\" and Dr. Spock have converted mommy and daddy.If education is to be effective, I should like to suggest here, as I did to Mr.William E. Oriol, staff director for Senator Williams' Committee on Aging, that Government booklets issued to inform the general public must be not only simple and readable but also directly applicable to market situations. While the infor- mation given is accurate, and the standards sound, the advice does not always prove helpful in the store or the marketplace.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 269 As a general rule, I would first say that all such material should be pre- tested in the field to see whether the average consumer can, in fact, follow the suggestions or recommendations, identify the product or ingredients mentioned. and learn how to ask for such articles or check performance tests cited. It may also be expected that such a continuing campaign will be instrumental in encouraging manufacturers, distributors and others who deal with the public to recognize the needs for such information and teach salespeople about the products they sell. Second, I believe that it is essential always to draw both industry and con- sumers into the preparation of such booklets. The guides, standards, and simi- lar statements issued by the National Better Business Bureau are either initially prepared by industry, or at least with their cooperation. In this way, we know that we are talking about products, models, sizes, and standards which are actually available and used. Third, I believe that education should concentrate not so much on informa- tion but on developing a spirit of questioning. A well-known consumer consult- ant, who now writes a syndicated newspaper column, uses the technique of set- ting up panels of consumers, chiefly women, to teach them not so much what to buy but how to buy. Some skepticism should be built up in our buyers by sug- gesting sensible questions and offering responsible sources of information. For example, she reports that many consumers are impressed with endorsements by professional people and the statement that tests have been made, but that they rarely understand the limitations of these endorsements or the function of the tests. Such education is long and ardous but, in the long run, will develop a background and a basis for sound belief rather than simply a medicine chest of bits of information which, like the prescriptions, become outdated and unusable. Fourth, before attempting to teach, we should understand why people become the victims of medical quackery and other types of fraud. Viola Bernard, a psychiatrist, presented one of the most insightful papers at the recent congress on quackery, pointing out that we must recognize a rather wide spectrum of psychologically different types of people, among those who are especially prone to the illusory appeal of quackery. Intelligent people, she notes, who have not been satisfied with conventional care, may seize upon any promise of hope, no matter how farfetched or discredited. The need to believe in a therapeutic miracle is so strong that it drives one's intelligence to twisting the facts to fit emotional necessity. She describes others with varying kinds of degrees of maladjustment: those who long for something for nothing; the converts to the crusades and to the cults; those who are susceptible to irrational fears; and those who are motivated by so-called \"anti\" feelings who suspect any official body or authority because they wish to perpetuate their own power. Dr. Bernard's analyses are probably familiar to all of us who have thought about the problem, but I think we must act on them by developing a variety of approaches which will appeal to the wide variety of victims and potential victims. I would not want to leave this section on education without commenting on a number of very hopeful and promising developments. First, it is reassuring to know that most of the major Government agencies have assigned some person or group to the problem of aging as a sort of focal point, for gathering and dissemi- nating information in the best interests of older people. I am particularly pleased to report that last May, which was declared Senior Citizens Month by Presidential proclamation, the Consumer Education Branch of the Food and Drug Administration added a specialist in this field. Miss Fanny Davis, who is in this audience today, has as her main responsibility the development of channels of communication and the preparation of material for older populatin groups. We all look forward to a vigorous and stimulating program under her leadership. Many of the voluntary health agencies, as part of their community education functions, are paying special attention to the plight of the older person. Where older people are principal or frequent sufferers, as from arthritis, cancer, heart disease, national agencies develop special programs directed to them. Two weeks ago, for instance, I attended the American Cancer Society's Committee on New or Unproved Methods of Treatment which regularly issues reports on quackery and on State laws. Likewise, the Nutrition Foundation, largely supported by in- dustry, has recently published several pamphlets on diets and nutritional infor- mation. I have mentioned the Arthritis Foundation and would also like to note that the National Health Council is working on means for cooperation among all such agencies.270 HEAITH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Consumers Union, a well-known nonprofit organization which publishes Con-sumer Reports, has recently undertaken a survey of sources of information formeeting the problem of low-income consumers. The aged, for the most part, fitinto this category. Miss Lydia Strong, staff member, who is also with us today,has made a preliminary review and has suggested a number of agencies whichcan reach the low income and, to a large extent, the aged groups, where conven-tional pamphlets and reading matter rarely penetrate. Among them are welfaredepartments, housing authorities, public health agencies, labor unions, Govern-ment agencies, schools, and.churches. From my own experience, I have foundthat where older people are already gathered together, voluntarily or involun-tarily, a pointed approach is far more successful than general information ob-tained from the public press or from Government handouts. REGUIATION -Self-regulation is certainly next in importance. Mr. Willson, in his Senatecommittee speech, recommended that greater and more effective use of self-regulatory codes be encouraged to bring together responsible representatives ofcommerce and the professions interested in preventing abuses. This, he said,would exemplify the moral responsibility of the business community and alsopermit the Government to concentrate on the transgressors. In our country,voluntary regulation in enlightened self-interest affords, perhaps, the greatestcontinuing foundation of consumer protection. Better business bureaus, forexample, annually convince thousands of manufacturers and producers, as well asmedia, to improve and modify advertising so that only truthful representationsand honest information will reach 'the public. Obviously, since we are still inbusiness, our work is not done, but I can assure you that many more phonies andfrauds would cover the land if we were not watchful and persuasive.Although we handle consumer complaints, our major effort is directed towardadvising and helping business. To this end, we develop numerous codes andstandards for the proper presentation of products. For example, within thispast year, the bureau has developed a 10-point code for the advertising of land.It helped develop standards of ethical business practice for the Direct MailAdvertising Association. It has set up a code for the advertising of seat beltsand over the years has worked in similar fashion in the apparel industry, elec-tronics, home furnishings, and others.I should like to cite one other important area, the field of broadcasting. Itis well established that the radio and the picture tube are the most potent in-fluences for bringing the advertising message into the home. The recentlyestablished code authority of the National Association of Broadcasters has beenextremely active in the last few years in the regulation of television advertising.Three major television networks and approximately 405 commercial stations,some 70 percent of the total in the United States, subscribe to the televisioneode- Thp eae aguthority figoronsly beclives that eff-ctive self-regulatioux inltelevision advertising must be based on the principle of protecting the consumerfrom abuse and misleading representation. In the health field, some significantactions in 1963 are worth reporting. All representations of physicians, dentists,nurses, pharmacists, so-called men in white are barred in advertising in orderto protect the consuming public from any excessive encouragement in the direc-tion of self-diagnosis or self-medication. Our staff like that of the code au-thority believes the important personal factors in a physician's diagnosis andtreatment cannot be properly exhibited in mass media advertising. The au-thority took the step of banning any actual or implied physician's endorsementso that there could be no false sense of security on the part of the listener orviewer. Secondly, as I pointed out earlier, television codes for advertising ofproducts used in the treatment of arthritis and rheumatism were adopted toinsure that product usefulness is limited to temporary relief of minor achesand pains. They further advise advertisers to limit claims to those which areconsistent with the labeling which can be supported by scientific substantiation.The television industry still has far to go in the full elaboration of its code.But, I think you will agree that this is a step in the right direction. It is im-portant that consumers know about this development and cooperate by notinguntruths and sending them in as complaints, preferably to the station to whichthey are listening.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 271 ASSISTANCE Third, 1 recommend personal assistance. Importiont as education and self-regulation may be, I believe that unless responsibility is taken by agencies whichcan command authority and respect, the first two elements in this programmay have little or no impact. The numerous and various groupings of agedpeople in this country in senior centers, various housing developments, religiousand fraternal organizations, as members of insurance groups, and even as in-voluntary welfare recipients, or patients in nursing homes, offer a remarkableopportunity for access. At the conference on protective services, held at ArdenHouse last year under the auspices of the National Council on Aging, the speak-ers emphasized again and again the importance of working directly with olderpeople. The legal aid societies, welfare and social agencies, the representativesof Government bureaus, the teachers of adult classes, the leaders of recreationand cultural groups-all of these are in a position to know and understandthe elderly and their problems and to teach them how they can get the mostfor their dollar. It is my personal conviction that it is a basic responsibilityof local and Federal Government, as part of the assistance given to the de-pendent aged, to make certain that recipients utilize properly and effectivelythe funds given to them for sustenance. Otherwise, neither they as consumersnor we as taxpayers get full value. I cannot too much emphasize the importanceof personal, practical assistance, and the need for encouraging all manner ofagencies to adopt programs in this field. RESPONSIBILITY Here I want to talk about the fact that the professionals-the doctors, lawyers,the educators, the social workers-must recognize that they can constitute aforce for good or evil. As director of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Division ofthe National Better Business Bureau, I have had the unhappy task of pointingout to the medical profession, for example, that some members have not alwaysfulfilled their social responsibilities and professional duties. We look to scien-tific medicine for the support or substantiation of scientific claims and quiteproperly expect their help. Regrettably, we have found instances in whichdoctors have lent their names and prestige without performing the research at-tributed to them; they have improperly reported or interpreted statistics; theyhave participated in trumped-up clinical trials; they have endorsed productsdirectly or by implication without personal proof; and medical journals havepublished reports which are either incomplete or biased. I do not say that thisis common or frequent but it should not exist at all in a profession which wehonor and respect and which should live up to its own high code of ethicalpractices. It is also unfortunate that lawyers, who should be really concerned withthe public good, draft some of the credit, installment sales, and land contractswhich vitiate the purpose of fair and square dealing. Their concepts of pro-tection seem to be limited to building legal fences around borderline promotions.Also, their efforts to collect on unwanted and unordered merchandise are notin the common good. They have also not come forward to help the poor andignorant. It is true that a lawyer's chief function is to represent his client but itis not his sole function and, as an adviser and consultant, and frequently legis-lator, he can certainly exercise a vital force in the public interest.We are now developing a program of joint action and cooperation betweenlocal better business bureaus and medical societies. Similar collaboration ispossible with other professional groups. LAW Finally, any last point: the law. It is our belief that existing Federal lawsregulating false and fraudulent representations, if promptly and vigorously en-forced, would do everything that laws can do to protect the elderly from vic-timization. The regulatory agencies are doing a commendable job within thelimits of their resources and in light of the magnitude of the problem. NBBBhas recommended that such agencies as the Department of Health, Education, andWelfare, Federal Trade Commission, Post Office Department, and the Depart-ment of Agriculture be given the funds they need to function effectively in thepublic interest. 31-135-64-pt. 3- a272 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY We also believe that regulation and control be tempered and supported by education and explanation. It is no secret that consumer protection and educa- tion has been less than adequate as a function of Government. The recent report of the Consumer Advisory Council, while a good first step, is hardly a vigorous one. We, therefore, look forward and pledge our support to Dr. Esther Peterson, recently appointed by President Johnson as Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs. Coordination at the White House level has long been needed and we hope that this appointment and its prestige will lend genuine substance to this important responsibility. It is to be hoped that Dr. Peterson, as soon as pos- sible, will acquaint herself with the various resources and facilities available to her, some of which I have mentioned in the previous four points of my pro- gram. Obviously, neither she nor the Government can do everything. Working together, we believe there can be a strong and vigorous foundation of consumer protection for the elderly. In closing I wish to leave on a note for immediate action-improvement of local laws and their enforcement. Most of the evils which I mentioned earlier occur primarily at the local level. We have noted, however, that existing State and local laws, are often inadequate, and sometimes do not exist. State con- sumer fraud bureaus, for the most part, are just beginning. Current prosecution of schemesters and swindlers by city, county, and even State authorities hardly approaches the problem. Unless people are convinced that their own community cares for them and acts promptly, it is hardly reasonable to expect they will have faith in the Government or in the self-interest of industry. It is, therefore, imperative that a review of existing local laws be undertaken to determine where and how they can be strengthened and in what manner they can be best enforced. A study of food and drug laws is now underway, but that is not con- sumer oriented. Rather, such a study should include the best way by which consumers can obtain redress through small claims courts, through the use of legal aid bureaus, through bar associations, and through other advisers. In many instances, fines and jail sentences may hurt more than threatened pub- licity which may never be seen or may soon be forgotten. I would not, however, discount the latter, but suggest all available means. CONCLUSION I believe that I can end appropriately by quoting the bureau's conclusion on 'the subject given by Mr. Willson a year ago: \"Laws and education cannot by themselves protect people in the old age area. If they are to be fully protected, we recommend that responsible members of the community, such as relatives, friends, clergymen, lawyers, doctors, and others, who come in contact with old people, be available for guidance. If we subscribe to the concept that we are our brothers' keepers, should we not assume social responsibility for the aged? The exercise of this responsibility coupled with vigorous governmental action and commmunity endeaver, will give our aged the protectc they deseive.' Dr. LADiiwuR. With your permission, therefore, I should like to discuss ways in which we may be able to improve the education and understanding of our older population. A review of the, professional lite'rature, projects on aging and'the elderly, indicates that little atten- tion is given, to the older person as a consumer. Business studies have attempted to assess and describe this popula- tion in terms of market possibilities, but few, if any, are concerned with the exploitation of this group. 'True, thereare numerous one- shot expose articles about gyps and frauds dramatically highlighting the plight of widows or fads foisted on the elderly seeking to retain virility, or stories about nature foods for the fat and over 50, or about spellbinders and spielers. I have, however, seen no reports on plans for educating or servicing the elderly as purchasers. Programs against poverty, for example, do not yet include instruc- ting this well-recognized low-income group in ways of getting value for the dollar, a dollar that may be one of the last, for retired, unem- ployed persons. What agency, public or private, has surveyed their medical, nutritional, and maintenance needs in terms, of what can and should be bought?HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 273 Who has consistently studied the advertisements, house-to-house selling, mail order, or other appeals, to see whether the elderly are given responsible information so that they can make sensible decisions at the store and supermarket? It is of interest to note that the President's Council on Consumer Interests has assigned first priority to legislation policing the drug and cosmetic industries, as well as to deceptive packages. It may then be hoped that some of the problems I have raised here will receive early study, and perhaps solution. I do not discount the very laudable work of many Government agen- cies, professional societies, voluntary health organizations, consumer and business groups in issuing books and pamphlets, but I wonder how well they reach people for whom they are intended and how effectively they are used. I know this committee is compiling a bibliography of Government publications for the elderly and suspect that the total may well be over a thousand, covering health, clothing, housing, employment, business opportunities, insurance, and many other subjects. But I would urge that the compilation project be extended to cover not only the number of booklets distributed but, at least in a few fields, the impact or change effected. Is a free or inexpensive brochuiereally helpful in improving buying habits, spending patterns, using equip- ment, keeping house, and, most important, avoiding health hazards and raising living standards? If not, perhaps other methods may be preferable. Should we not, for example, teach how to get reliable information from responsible sources? Should we not instruct the various work- ers-doctors, nurses, social service persoimel, guidance specialists, and other caretakers, how to help people help themselves in their com- munities? RecentlyJI spoke to a senior citizens group in the lower East Side of New York and heard complaint after complaint about doctors who did not explain what the medications were, or indicate approximate price. They reported that drugstores were selling various preparations and devices which had limited value or even no value for the problems they presented. They found costs completely out of line. Discount stores, to which they naturally went for bargains, obviously had no time or interest in selling what was needed. Advertising, espe- cially on television, was reported as confusing, if not misleading. -Newspapers, notably the foreign language press, carried many adver- tisements for questionable items with guarantees incapable of ful- fillment. Far too much, in my opinion, is written about fraud and quackery in terms of the spectacular or outrageous chicanery and far too little about simple, commonplace reniedies. These can provide real benefit when properly used and properly priced. Explanations of this type unfortunately are not news. Such stories, therefore, don't get printed and their educational potential is lost. Moreover, if they were 're- ported, only a small minority might be expected to apply the infor- mation. I was, however, more impressed with the fact that these people realized that they were \"being taken\" daily and insidiously, not neces- sarily dramatically. They felt helpless and resentful. As a result,274 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY they expressed criticism of the Government. They look to our Govern- ment for protection, defense, and advice, and claimed they did not get it. Again and again, they implied that big government and big busi- ness does not care about them as people-as dependents, perhaps, but not as responsible members of our community. Although I pointed out to them as consumers they constituted a powerful group, grow- ing in number and with many allies, they replied that they had neither the organization nor the information to act effectively. It is to be hoped that this committee will at least provide encourage- ment and devise ways by which these people can act and express themselves. I do not believe that laws by themselves can make a significant difference in this respect because our laws generally require proof of violation before enforcement. I would not necessarily change this feature, but I would urge that more attention be given to pre- ventive enforcement through cooperation with industry and with ad- vertisers. Again, referring to Commissioner Larrick, I heard him speak on this. He made the point very well, and I trust made it to you as well. Further, even where laws seem adequate as far as written statutes on the books, enforcement is costly, time-consuming and fre- quently technical so that a fraud may continue for some time, and in various places without being checked. I am sure you have many il- lustrations of 5- and 6-year-old cases in your book. I would like to conclude and suggest a five-point program which is detailed in the paper appended to this statement. First, I advo- cate an intensive and extensive program of consumer education, us- ing all media and involving industry and other organizations con- cerned with the elderly. I believe that we should concentrate on developing a spirit of under- standing and questioning, rather than simply supplying information. The information we do supply, however, should be clear, practical and understandable. It should be useable for the ordinary consumer who Second, more attention and more emphasis should be given to self- regulation. President Willson, when he appeared before this com- mittee last year, recommended that greater and more effective use of regulatory codes be encouraged to bring together responsible repre- sentatives of commerce and the professions interested in preventing abuses. It is his feeling that this approach would exemplify the moral responsibility of the business community and permit the Government to concentrate on transgressors. In our experience, the opportunity to develop self-discipline coupled with support from the Government and from the public can be translated into an effective force for con- sumer protection. Third, I strongly recommend personal assistance. While it is im- portant that education and self-regulation be promoted, personal guidance is paramount. Mitany of the aged in this country are reached, serviced, and even controlled by a large army of Government work- ers, professional workers, leaders, and instructors.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 275 These people, especially the welfare department staffs, should un- derstand the consumer problems of the older persons they are privi- leged to help and should assist them in buying what they need and teaching them how to use what they buy. Fourth, we must consider professional responsibility and integrity. As director of the food, drug, and cosmetic division, I have the task of pointing out to the medical profession, for example, that some members do not apparently fulfill their social obligations and profes- sional duties with the care and concern we expect. Likewise, many lawyers who should really be interested in the public good are engaged to draft some of the credit instruments and installment contracts which tend to undermine fair and square dealing. As I pointed out in Chicago last month, their concepts of protection seem to be limited to building fences around borderline promotions rather than coming forward to help the poor, the elderly, and the ignorant. Lawyers are advisers, consultants, legislators, and are in a uniquely strategic position to lend their intelligence and good offices to this significant endeavor. We at the Better Business Bureau are now engaged in a nationwide cooperative enterprise with local medical societies, through the sup- port of the American Medical Association. I believe Mr. Throck- morton may have made some reference to this yesterday. We hope shortly to involve the voluntary health associations, some of the Government agencies, and media groups so that we can combat quackery at the local level as soon as it appears and in ways which are understandable in cities and towns. Such active collaboration at the grassroots, in my opinion, will in the long run be much more effective than occasional national conferences or abstract programs which can- not be comprehended. Fifth, we must consider the possibilities of law and regulation. It is our belief that for the most part, existing Federal laws regulating false and fraudulent representation, if promptly and vigorously en- forced, would protect the elderly from victimization. We, of course, endorse the proposals made yesterday, extending the Food and Drug Act to include devices, and we are also supporting the possibility of changing the postal statutes to simplify the problem of intent. It is our conviction, however, that law enforcement at this level must proceed along with public education and cooperation with in- dustry and business. We, therefore, look forward and pledge our support to Dr. Esther Peterson, recently appointed as special assistant for consumer affairs, and to the other Government units which have been established to help the elderly. It is to be hoped that this dedicated group of workers will inform themselves as soon as possible of the various resources available to them through voluntary agencies and private groups so that a coordi- nated attack on this problem may be undertaken. While this committee cannot recommend local legislation, it is our hope that encouragement will be given to various States, counties, and cities to enforce laws available to them and to consider necessary legislation and regulation at the local level. Many of these we have found are inadequate and sometimes do not exist. Consumer fraud bureaus, for the most part, are just beginning. It is, therefore, imperative that existing local laws for the protection276 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY of consumers be reviewed to determine whether they are. sufficient and effective. It is to be hoped that this five-point program may be favorably considered by your committee and be implemented quickly and as appropriately as possible. We would hope that the Federal agencies already engaged in this work will be given the necessary financial and personnel support to make creative and imaginative use of the statutes under which they operate.It is to be further hoped that they will embrace the public through the various organizations and agencies I have named, so that, as I said to the group of senior citizens in the lower East Side: \"You are the Government; we are the Government; and we must all work together.\" Thank you for giving me this opportunity to present our position. Senator WILLIAMS. Thank you very much for your testimony, Dr. Ladimer, and also for the help you have been to this committee in advising our staff as we have been developing this subject. How long have you been in the position you are now in, Dr. Ladimer? Dr. LADIMER. Since July of 1962. Senator WnLLIAMs. Approaching 2 years? Dr. LADIMER. Yes, senility. Senator WILiAMis. Well, let me tell you, if you read a certain book, you can live to be a hundred. Dr. LADIMER. That is right. Senator WILLIAMS. The New York Times ad on \"How To Live To Be a Hundred.\" Have you seen this? Dr. LADimER. Yes; we have not only seen that, but I brought with me the letter we just received from the publisher in which he informs us that he is going to accept all our recommendations for changing that ad. He has previously been barraged by criticism from the AMA and from its president, and we hope that he will come through. This is dated March 3. He says: Enclosed you will find an extensively revised ad on \"How To Live To Be a Which though it contains the facts presented in the book, presents them in copy of an entirely different tone. I think you will find all of your suggestions, in writing to me, included in this copy. May I hear from you? And so forth. So that in a sense, while I would like to enlarge on that particular advertising, we have a somewhat better statement indicating the kind of cooperation we sometimes get. In this instance I trust that we will be completely successful. The book itself by Dr. Clement Martin, is, as you possibly know, a standard hygiene type of book. It is the advertising that suggests that it is, well, a \" wow,\" and it is not really. Senator WILLIAMS. How broad an area advertising do you monitor, and in this case I gather you communicated directly with Dr. Martin? Dr. LADIniER. We communicated with at least four people or four agencies, but more specifically, with the publisher and with Dr. Mar- tin, and were able to get some concessions, shall I say. We also had the help of the American Medical Association and we were concernedHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 277 about the apparent misuse and misrepresentations indicating the sup-port of the medical profession for thisbook. We have known about this publisher, I mean, this is not his first book, and doubtlessly will not be his last. This is an approach or technique that he uses for other publications. Senator WnmAiAs. We sort of stumbled into this specific extrav- agant claim for a publication. I was going to ask you this question from your approaching 2 yearsof experience, whether the climate in this area over- claims is im- proving or whether it is not improving. Dr. LADImER. Well, this is a difficult question. I would like to answer by saying that we are of the opinion that we are getting a good deal more support and cooperation from media, at the level at which it counts, namely, will they accept advertisements? We are, I think, far more successful now in getting these people to question ad- vertisers, and the ad agencies and to get changes. This may not be apparent if you look at some of the things in the newspapers, television, and radio, but it would be interesting to know how many more horrible things you do not see because we and other people are on the job. I would also hope that the effect of the new drug law, in my field, would make certain changes, but most of the material that I deal with may be so-called technically old stuff, and, therefore, does not neces- sarily come under the new drug regulations. The rewrites and re- hashes of things which have been available for years, consequently, do not necessarily go to the FDA. Also, the FDA, as you know, is not at least legally concerned with advertising of proprietary remedies unless it can be demonstrated thatit is also labeling. We feel that this is basically our job, at least at the level of consumer understanding and industry cooperation. We do negotiate with the FTC, of course, and with other agencies. Senator WILLIAMS. You are familiar with the case of Joseph Wolf-gang Wuenn, charged with defrauding in New Jersey? Dr. LADIMER. This is a so-called psychoquack or mental hygiene expert, or clinic involving guidance and consultation not necessarilyfor older people, but generally to provide a so-called mental health type of assistance. It is our feeling that this is a field that. has never been adequately explored because it is on the borderline. We, as a matter of practice, do not get into professional relationships, but clearly where these men or agencies advertise directly to the public, we are concerned. There has also been an attempt on the part of the AMA to do something more about the so-called psychoquacks. We have called this to the attention of the National Association ofMental Health, the American Psychiatric Association, among others. We hope that we will be able to run some of these people out. We, ourselves, have come across one or two that are, including recognized licensed practitioners who evidently are not aware of the impression they make. We have called this to their attention and I amhappy to report that they have withdrawn. People of this kind, I doubt, however, would generally be interested in that kind of impression, so we will have to get them out in someother way, perhaps through local enforcement or use of the mails or something of that sort.278 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Our basic approach here as in every other instance is to advise the medium, television, radio and newspapers, that we have grave doubts and that we would not recommend acceptance of such advertising. Sometimes we will go very far and say we declare this to be abso- lutely against the public interest, and they usually take our view when we get that strong about it. Senator WILLIAMS. We had discussion yesterday with the Food and Drug Administration folks about the possibility of dealing with the false devices in the healing arts, and it seems that there is a pretty sod way to deal with this, by empowering the FDA to determine effi- zLcy. I hope we are moving in that direction. imagine you would agree with this? 1r. LADMER. I so stated in the initial presentation that we cannot see any distinction between this type of health aid and any other, and we believe that the law should extend to all. As a matter of fact, as I think Dr. Joseph Davis (FDA) who is here with me will agree, there are some instances in which it is difficult to determine whether something is a drug or a device, or something else, and it would be much simpler if it did not make any difference. We would then get them all. Senator WILLIAMS. In this psychoquackery area, perhaps it is a little more difficult to deal with. It probably will ultimately come back to whether a person is practicing in a professional area without a license. Dr. LADIMER. Yes, but that would not be our problem. I thought you were going to refer to the more complex problem, what I call \"selling nothing.\" Now, there are a number of people who admit that they sell nothing and that they are not at all ashamed of this. They say, well, doctors sell nothing also. They (the doctors) call them placebos, call them dummies; and we all know that a substantial number of people will respond to any- thing-maybe 20 percent or 30 percent. The promoters argue if they sell nothing, whether it is dressed up as a bracelet or a stone or a drawing, with nothing in it, or a book, or a record, or other things, it is, nevertheless, useful, because a person who employes it is con- vinced that he benefits florfm it. To iiai the pOilit quite precise, they feel that any type of assistance of this kind, so long as it is properly generated, is not illegal, and should not be removed from the market. This is the most difficult thing to prove and we have had a num- ber of the Federal agencies look into this, and they admit that this is a very tough one. Senator WILLIABIS. I wish we could continue our discussion, but time is a problem around here, these days particularly. What do you have on your recording device there? Dr. LADIMER. Well, Mr. Oriol suggested that since I was doing some work with a group of older people-and you may recall that I men- tioned this-you might be interested in hearing some of the reactions to a few questions in their own words. We edited this yesterday to stay within approximately 5 or 6 minutes, so that we would not go overtime, but I do not think that we in any sense distorted the mean- ingof what this group had to say. So I feel perfectly sure that this is an acctirate representation, a symbolization of Mhatt these people had to say. This coul(1 be done at any time.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 279 Senator WILLIAMS. Let us take time out. *What is the group thatyou are talking about?Dr. LADIMER. It is all explained, so to speak, on here.(Dr. Ladiiner played the tape recorded interview.)(The transcription follows:) TAPE RECORDING OF INTERVIEWS WITH MEMBERS OF EDUCATIONAL ALLIANCE OFNEW YORK CITY, CONDUCTED BY IRVING LADDEB Mr. LADIMER. This is a recording of a group of representatives of the OlderAdult Division of the Educational Alliance. The Educational Alliance is a com-munity center in the lower East Side of New York City, established 75 yearsago to help immigrants from Eastern Europe settle in this country. The allianceis still continuing in this work with new groups of people and has a large pro-gram of social service, health, housing, community work, welfare, and other im-portant functions.This group is going to talk to you about the problems that they have hadin health frauds and quackery. We'll start with you now. Your name? VOICE. Hilda Schier. Mr. LADIMER. Uh-huh What-and the real trouble HILDA ScnIEB. All right. All I could tell you-it's very hard to get alongtoday, especially when you find people cheat you when you get older. Theytake Mr. LADIMEE. What do you mean, people cheat you? HILDA SCHIER. And television cheats you, too.Mr. LADIMEB. HILDA SCaRIER. And too.Mr. LADIMER. In way? Can you-can you give us an example?HILDA SCHIEB. By the way. I'm a person with a lack of sleep; I could neversleep, I could never [inaudible], and I just lay there and fuss around all nightand I sit by television watching. All of a sudden-[inaudible] mention the names.Mr. LADIMEE. We ask you to mention the names. HILDA SCHIER. All of a sudden I see a big advertisement which advertises\"Sleepies,\" and it's still on and I go ahead and buy it and I feel when you take[inaudible] it doesn't help, so I limit myself but it never helps me.Mr. LADIMEB. Well, why do you think you were cheated?HILDA SCHIER. I was cheated because it didn't work the way they promisedit to work; they promised to sleep all night and they show you a picture on tele-vision where the woman is-tosses around and all of a sudden she takes thepills- NEW VOICE. I have my [inaudible] and I have the doctor. Now-and the doc-tor came and he gave me vitamins-he says [inaudible] so he gave me vitaminsand I took the vitamins about 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks, he came again. Hesays to me, \"How do you feel?\" I says, \"Doctor, I'm-there's no change.\" Helooked in toward the bathroom, he sees I took out a half a bottle and he says, andhe looks on the label. He says to me, \"What did he give you?\"Mr. LADIMEB. Who is-who asked you this question? VOICE. The doctor asked me what the drugsman gave me; he gave me me theprescription. He says, \"What did he give you?\" I says you asked me what hegave me? You give me the prescription; I gave him the money and he gave methe pills. Well, the-the-then he gave me another prescription. He says, \"Take thatbottle and bring it back to the drugsman.\"I went in and I tells them, I says, \"The doctor said that this is not the pillsthat you were supposed to give me.\" He says, \"Well, what does he want me togive you, new feet?\" How do you like that? I says, \"I don't want no new feet;give me my $3.\" He says, \"Here.\" He took the pills and threw 'em in a basket, and he gave methe $3. The doctor-he gave me another prescription. He says, \"Don't take itt'that drugstore. Take it someplace else.\" He told me where to go. I wentthere-it cost me for 50 pills $6. This sold for 100 pills $3. I took that pill forabout 10 days and started walking around. I sleep good all night.Mr. LADnIEB. What do you think was the trouble?VOICE. I think it was lack of vitamin B. 81-135-64-pt. 3-4280HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Mr. LADIMER. But I mean-you said that the pharmacist, the drugstore-did he give you the right pills ? Do you think he VOICE. Yeah. Yeah. He hadn't, so the doctor says. Mr. LADIMER. I see. I see. VOICE. The doctor said \"He didn't give you the right pills.\"Mr. LADIMER. How about your experience with the drugstores? Have you had any similar problems, Mrs. Schier?Mrs. SCHIER. Well, there were many times that I-there was a mistake by the druggist. And- Mr. LADIMER. Can you be sure they were real mistakes?Mrs. Sclinni. Well, when the doctor comes and he medicine and he sees whathe wrote and what you got, so they're two different things. I think it-it's notsomething you can just throw away and be nothing. You could get-you coulddie from it or you could get very sick, too. And when-I think when the drug-gist has a diploma to practice pharmacy, he should be more careful and if hecan't be careful by himself, there should be a way to watch him, how we watchour measurements and scales-so we should be watched this way too and every- where.Mr. LADIMER. Well, do you think that there is not enough control now- MAN'S VoICE. Huh? Mr. LADIMER. Do you think there not enough- MAN'S VOICE. No. No, there's not enough [inaudible]. Too much commercial on drugs. Mr. LADIMER. How about you, Mrs. Schier?Mrs. SCHIER. I think this could be controlled, just like anything else. We de-mand from our Government that they should try to help us, especially some ofus that don't understand so much the basic-what we buy and what they sell uson television or radio-that this should be some kind of control, especially ondrug business. It can help. And if you made one little step not good so youyou could get. very sick-you have to struggle till you die or you could die right away, too.-Mr. LADIMER. Have any of you been taking health foods any special health foods for older people? Like vitamins? WOMAN'S VOICE. I take vitamin B.Mr. LADIMER. Well-where do you get these vitamins? VOICE. Well, I get 'm in the drugstore. I used to get them in the clinic once ina while. But most of the time, I have to pay for them and they're very expen- sive; they're $12 a hundred. Mr. LADIMER. How about advertising for vitamins? VOICE. No, I never buy anything advertised. Mr. LADIMER. Why? VOICE. I'm afraid.Mr. LADIMER. Why? Why do-why afraid? -VOICE. I don't believe them. Mr. LADIMER. Oh, do you ever believe 'VOICE. I never believe-I wouldn't even buy a box of powder to wash the dishes,-until I see that it's the right one. Mr. LADIMER. Now, how would you know which is right? VOICE. First, I looked for the kosher. That's the first thing. [Laughter.]When I see that It's kosher, I figure a little bit on the gyp, but a little bit might be all right.Mr. LADIME. All right. That's fine. What about-but aside from kosher,which doesn't cover everything, there must be something else. You said beforethat you don't trust advertising but why is this so. What makes you [inaudible]? VOICE. Why? Mr. LADIMER. Yes.VOICE. Because I know whatever they advertise they advertise for themselves, 'not for me. Mr. LADIMER. Do you feel that way too? OTHrER VOICE. Yeah.Mr. LADIMER. Mrs. Schier, you have told me that you thought there mightbe some things that could be done. What are your suggestions?-Mrs. SoHIER. Well, I feel that since the Government took over a lot of things,like-we. never had meat grading until we just were cheated by the meat. Andtoday-we were fighting and I was in city hall myself there when they had tooka big piece of meat and they started to cut it into parts and they were talkingHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 281 on It. Why pay for good grade meat when you get a cheap grade. And theytook time but we had-we [inaudible] and all of a sudden [inaudible]. Wewent and we were fighting for it and then Congress [inaudible] and they broughtout from there wherever its necessary from the Government and they helped.Now, if you buy meat it's graded. Why not be able to do everything forgrading. Mr. LADIMER. Mrs. [inaudible] Mrs. Schier mentioned some of the work thatyou do as consultant. I wonder whether we could take this occasion now tosummarize your opinion and your views about the group. particularly as yousee it, how they have-handle these problems, what you think should and can bedone here at the alliance and perhaps what kind of educational or instructionalmaterials or services would be helpful.Mrs. .Not so long ago, some of us that are sitting here did not knowthat there were no cures for arthritis. Since we have had talks here on thesubject by outstanding physicians our members are aware of what the advertisedmedications can do and what some of the prescribed prescriptions can do._ Also,I would like to indicate that there are areas of great need that are not beingreflected in this talk today. There is one person sitting in this group that iscarrying his dentures in his pocket and that's because so many of the denturesare made by people who are not very well qualified and this is done primarilyto save a little money. We later find that one of the woman that left earlier here has had to haveher gums incised to take care of exactly such a problem. We have an exampleof one elderly man who for years had been taking drugs for constipation and[inaudible] only to discover after he had been sent for a routine physical checkupwhich is something we hope every one of our older adults will be getting eitherthrough a private doctor or through a clinic-Mr. LADIMER. Was that case-I'm sorry for interrupting. Was that a casein which he bought these through a newspaper ad which gave him some reasonto believe that this would help him? Do you know why he got these?Mrs. .I'm not aware whether he bought them through a newspaperad but I am aware that he got them from the pharmacy without a doctor'sprescription and continued to use these over years, only to discover that [cough-ing] had cancer of the bowels and has since been operated. Fortunately, be'sfunctioning and we hope that this intervention has been in time.There are many instances of need that have been-are worsened because ofa tendency that our own members do not recognize at least in turning to medicalauthorities and for that reason, the educational alliance is cooperating withcommunity health and welfare agencies to obtain a fair share of miracles that[inaudible] on a preventive and curative basis.Mr. LADIMER. What about this Committee on Fraud and Quackery that youwere telling me about? Mrs. .Well, this committee is very much concerned with health fraudand quackery, but their knowledge has to be greatly augmented before theycan really express their pointed resentment. At- the present time, they showgreater resentment about deceptive packaging, and so forth, something whichthey understand better than they do the medications which they take daily andwhich really makes some big dents in these little incomes that so many of themare living on. Many people are hesitant to report because the problems are of-a personalnature and there Is a degree of shame that goes along with being a fool. Tobe taken in Is a painful thing, and it is particularly painful to make admissionsto your own fears about something of that kind. I think one of the real needsthat we feel in community settlement houses is the lack of a mechanism forpassing on some of the things that occur daily but at this very moment I findIt hard to call to attention, perhaps a government consumer program wouldgive status to-first of all, recognition of these problems and a valid place whereto report these, and I think it would give people a feeling of importance anddignity in recording and reporting any example of being cheated.Mr. LADIMEB. OK. (Whereupon, the tape ended abruptly.) Senator WILIAMS. Again, our sincere thanks for all of your helpand congratulations, too, for the very important work you are doingand the contribution you are making to-as you in your words,282 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY stated: \"square dealing in this area.\" It is a very important arca- food and drugs. Senator WILWAMS. Our next witness is Henry B. Montague, U.S. Chief Postal Inspector, and I believe Counsel Wenchel is with Mr. Montague, and in addition, Mr. Callahan, William Callahan. All right, Mr. Montague, we welcome you here and are looking forward to hearing you. STATEMENT OF HENRY B. MONTAGUE, U.S. CHIEF POSTAL INSPEC- TOR; ACCOMPANIED BY ADAM G. WENCHEL, ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL; AND WILLIAM F. CALLAHAN, DIRECTOR, FRAUD AND MAILABILITY INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION, BUREAU OF CHIEF POSTAL INSPECTOR, U.S. POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT Mr. MONTAGUE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am accompanied this morning by Mr. Adam Wenchel, Associate General Counsel for the Post Office Department, and Mr. William F. Callahan, who is Director of the Fraud and Mailability Investigation Division, Bureau of the Chief Postal Inspector. We are pleased to have this further opportunity of presenting to this distinguished committee some of the particulars of the Post Office Department's efforts against mail fraud. The mail fraud statutes 18 U.S.C. 1341, 39 U.S.C. 4005, impose a duty upon the Postmaster General to prevent the postal establishment from being used in the erpetration of schemes to defraud the public. A less well known gut very important weapon in the fight against swindlers who use the mails to defraud consumers, particularly our elderly citizens is 18 U.S.C. 1821, which prohibits the transportation by mail of false teeth or other prosthetic dental appliances unless authorized by a person licensed to practice dentistry. Since this statement relates primarily to medical fraud and quackery rather than to the broad scope of consumer frauds, we feel that a brief summary of the entire program will be of assistance in placing the medical fraud and auackerv aspect in proDer DersDective. In fiscal year 1963, 88,223 complaints of alleged mail fraud were received, 9,190 investigations initiated; 619 arrests were effected and 581 convictions obtained. In addition, 4,775 promotions were sup- pressed through administrative action of various kinds including for- eign and domestic fraud proceedings initiated by the Post Office De- partment's General Counsel, Louis J. Doyle. In cases investigated by the Postal Inspection Service, $57,913,000 was filched from the public. Fines in the amount of $145,200 were imposed and court ordered and voluntary restitutions of $1,995,460 were obtained. These investigations were closely coordinated with other interested agencies to avoid duplication of effort. The criminal statistics are the best evidence of the overall results of this program: Fiscal year 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 Convictions - 309 366 431 524 581HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 283 Investigations of medical fraud cases are conducted for the mostpart by a spCecial group of poStAl inspectors who work directly fromi our heCadquartcrs in W1rashlingtoni, D.C. Theyr are assisted when neces- s.try by inspectors douiciled at strategic pohits throughout the coun-try. Close liaison is maintained with the Food and Drug Adminis-tration, the Departm111enlt of ,Jiistice, and otlier gover nental agencies with whom0 essential information is exchanged. Joint action is taken agatinst offenders where this appears to be in the public interest.Although postal inspectors still occasionally encounter medical quackery items involving electric belts, buzzers, bell-ringing machines, and even black magic potions guaranteed to cure all manner of disease,todaty's frauds are generally more sophisticated. Promoters do not sooften promise outright cures for serious diseases but offer preparationsto \"aid\" in curing various conditions which the American consumer finds undesirable, such as baldness, obesity, and so forth. Treatments are offered by mail for every conceivable condition in-cluding cancer, diabetes, prostate trouble, asthma, arthritis, heart dis-eases, and impotency to name but a few. Such schemes continue to be a source of great concern since the victims are frequently induced toattempt self-diagnosis and treatment meanwhile deferring proper at-tention. A case in point is that of Dr. Roy IV. Delrelles, who on D~ecember 13, 1963, at Shelbyville, Ind., was convicted of mail fraudand was sentenced to serve 5 years on each of two counts, sentences torun consecutively. DeWelles used the mails in advertising traveling medical clinics atwhich the aged and ailing were told they suffered from such diseasesas cancer and were charged as high as $500 for treatments on the DeWells cure-all device called \"The Detoxacolon.\" This device simplyadministered a colonic enema highly dangerous to some victims and therapeutically worthless to others. Through this scheme, DeWelles obtained an estimated $500,000 overthe years in the sale of some 200 machines, and an estimated $1 millionin treatment fees. In our last report we noted that medical quacks were going south ofthe border to broadcast claims over Mexican radio stations which wouldnot be permitted over domestic stations. As a result of concerted ac-tion by the Federal Communications Commission which monitoredthe broadcasts and the Postal Inspection Service, several of these pro-moters were indicted and one conviction has been obtained. Othershave abandoned the practice rather than face prosecution. The sale of dentures and other oral prosthetic devices through themails by unlicensed persons is a menace to health since ill-fitting plateshave in some instances caused oral cancer. While this practice is not as prevalent as it was prior to the passage of 18 U.S.C. 1821 in 1942,the investigation of such cases still requires time and attention by postal inspectors. On December 20, 1963, Belden Clyde, operating as Tru-Grip DentalLaboratory, Chicago, Ill., was convicted of violating this statute which forbids the use of the mails in the taking of impressions for the manu-facture of dentures by other than persons licensed to practice den-tistry. He encouraged owners of old plates to make their own im-pressions with his preparation called \"Tru-Grip Refit\" from whichnew plates were manufactured. Many complaints were received alleg-284 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY ing dissatisfaction on the part of purchasers. Subsequently, on Janu- ary 31, 1964, on recommendation of the General Counsel, the Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department issued a fraud order forbidding the delivery of mail or the cashing of money orders for this concern. Although during fiscal year 1963 emphasis was placed on the de- velopment of cases holding a promise of criminal prosecution as dis- tinguished from those approachable solely by fraud-order action, con- siderable success was also had in the latter category as indicated below: Dom estic fraud orders...------------------------------------------------- 13 Foreign fraud orders...------------------- ---- --... ------------------------ 9 Formal discontinuance stipulations----------------------------------- 28 Inform al discontinuances...----------------------- ------------------------ 27 In addition, criminal action was taken during the period as in- dicated below: Cases formally presented to U.S. attorneys...----------------------------- 10 Indictments obtained--------------------------------------------------- 10 A rrests effected...------------------------------------------------------- 9 Convictions obtained--------------------------------------------------- 8 Our investigations and prosecutions of medical fraud cases be- come more complex every year. However, we are encouraged by the results being obtained. We are pleased to report that local medical societies have been most cooperative in assisting our inspectors by providing us with the names of qualified doctors whose testimony is essential in these cases. With the continued wholehearted cooperation of all concerned, we believe that we can cope with the situation. In closing, I wish to assure you that our program against medical fraud and quackery will be continued. Postmaster General John A. Gronouski has directed us to maintain the strictest possible enforce- ment of the mail-fraud statutes. Thank you. Senator WIMLIAMfs. Thank you very much, Mr. Montague, and I want to thank you, too, for the continuing help you have been to our Com-t ;4- 4 It has been pointed out to me, although I have not been exposed to any of the advertising, that there is a new cure-all approach to life- self-hypnosis. Have you folks been exposed to any of this in your work? Mr. MONTAGUE. I understand that we have some complaints on that, Mr. Chairman and we are conducting investigations at the present time. Senator WuLLIAms. What is this all about, and how does it come into the mail-fraud area? Mr. MONTAGtE. I think perhaps Mr. Callahan may have a closer working knowledge of that. I will ask him to answer that question. Mr. CALLAHAN. Senator, generally the mails are used both in adver- tising these books and preparations, and also in delivering the prod- uct, that is wherein we obtain jurisdiction. We have had several complaints, primarily from professional people, with reference to this relatively recent development of self-hypnosis for the cure of various things, and we are now looking into it.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 285 We have made several test purchases and I understand that thesepurchases have been referred to our medical advisers for officialopinion as to how we can act upon them. Senator WILLIAMS. So, it is still under investigation. There hasnot been any action yet? Mr. CALLAIAN. That is correct, sir. That is a relatively new development. Senator WILLIAMS. Prosecutions are made rather difficult, are theynot, in mail fraud, because of the elements of proof that are necessary? Mr. MONTAGUE. Yes, sir, we have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there has been a scheme devised, that there is an intent to defraud. Senator WILLIAMS. Do you have any suggestions to us how legisla- tion might be changed to make it possible for you to reach more of these practitioners who are grossly misrepresenting and grossly over- claiming benefit from their product? Mr. MONTAGUE. As far as the criminal statute is concerned, Sen- ator, we feel it is fair and equitable that we should have to prove that a scheme was devised, that there is intent. We do obtain voluntary discontinuances of many of these schemes, and the U.S. attorney some- times decides not to prosecute as long as the operator has gone out of business. With regard to our formal administrative action cases, Mr. Wenchel may have some comment on that. Mr. WENCHEL. As you know, there has been in the Department consideration of suggesting amendment to the administrative fraud order statute to eliminate the necessity of finding intent to defraud. However, the Department has not yet worked out all of the problems which are inherent in such an amendment, so we are not ready at this time to recommend to Congress that there be an amendment to thatstatute. Senator WILLIAMs. Senator Fong? Senator FONG. Mr. Montague, what is the difference between anadministrative action as differentiating from a criminal prosecution? Mr. MONTAGUE. In administrative action, Senator, the General Counsel would notify the operator that there is to be a hearing to de- cide whether or not the use of the mails should be barred to the opera- tion, and the operator would have an opportunity to come in and be heard, with counsel. If the final determination is made that a fraudexists, then a fraud order would be issued against the operator; that is, any mail addressed to him under the name by which he is doing busi- ness would be stamped fraudulent and returned to him. Under the criminal action, we present the findings to the U.S. at-torney. If he decides there is evidence of a criminal violation, he pre- sents it to the grand jury. If an indictment is returned then the oper-ator has the opportunity to plead, and if he pleads not guilty, a trial ensues. Then we get either an acquittal or conviction. Senator FONG. Most of the work of the Department is to get thefraudulent person to desist? Mr. MONTAGUE. Yes, sir, we try to accomplish both, if possible. We attempt, if there is evidence, to get a voluntary desist and go aheadwith the criminal action. If the person does not voluntarily desist, then we would recommend to the General Counsel that appropriate action be taken formally.286 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Senator FONG. I notice in your statement you say there were 88,000 comnplaints and 9,000 investigations, just a little over 10 percent? Mr. MONTAGUE. Yes, sir. Senator FONG. Does that mean you do not have the staff to really carry out your investigation? Mr. MONTAGUE. That would indicate that in some cases we may get numerous complaints, hundreds or thousands, in some others, we may get only one complaint. However, we always do have personnel prob- lems. In our total staff we have about a thousand inspectors, and we eke out as much manpower as we can on fraud investigations. Last year we were able to devote the time of about 105 inspectors to this type of investigation. This year we are adding about 25 addi- tional men. We hope that in the years to come, we will be able to add more, because we certainly need them. Senator FONG. Is the fraudulent scheme on the increase or on the decrease? Mr. MONTAGUE. I would say that they are on the increase. Senator FONG. Thank you. Senator WmLLmAius. Wat is your budget for the fraud program, Mr. Montague? Mr. MONTAGUE. We have costed out the program, and in total, that is considering all of our inspector manpower, clerical manpower, auditing manpower, the time that the General Counsel would devote to this, and the judicial officer, the cost comes to about $2,400,000 per year. Last year fines imposed by the court were $125,000, court ordered and voluntary restitutions were $1,995,000, for a total of $2,120,000. So this program comes within about a quarter of a million dollars of paying for itself, and this is without taking into consideration the huge sums saved the public by putting the swindlers out of business. Senator WILLIAMS. Thank you. Thank you very much, gentlemen. STATEMENT OF DR. FREDERICK J. STARE, CHAIRMAN, DEPART- MENT OF NUTRITION, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, HARVARD UNIVERSITY; ACCOMPANIED BY DR. DENA C. CEDERQUIST, SCHOOL OF HOME ECONOMICS, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY Senator WILLIAMS. Dr. Stare, I understand you have with you Dr. Dena Cederquist. School of I-Tome Economics, Michigan State Uni- versity. I understand you have a plane to catch shortly. Dr. STARE. Yes. Senator WILLIAMS. Good. We wanted to make sure that wve ac- commodated you to your schedule and we are very pleased to welcome you here. Dr. STARE. Thank you, Senator Williams. It is nice to have the opportunity to talk to you and your colleagues briefly about food quackery and chlarlataniism, particularly as it affects elderly persons. I did prepare a statement wlhiclh you may have for the record if you wish, but I thllk the remarks [ will make t'oclay w ill be somewhI iatdifferent, as I would rather talk to you extemporaneously. Senator WILLIAMS. Proceed informally and we will accept your statement.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 287 Dr. STARE. I am professor of nutrition at the Harvard School ofPublic Health. I have a Ph. D. degree in biochemistry and nutritionfrom the University of Wisconsin and also an M.D. obtained from theUniversity of Chicago. I did postdoctorate research on a RockefellerFoundation fellowship for about 3 years. I am licensed to practicemedicine in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.For the last 4 years I have had a little syndicated newspaper columncalled \"Food and Your Health,\" which locally appears in the Wash-ington Star and in Senator Fong's area appears in the Honolulu Ad-vertiser. This brings in quite a bit of fan mail, much of it from elderlypeople. The first point that I would like to make is that for me, a naive per-son as far as government and regulations are concerned, I just cannotunderstand why it takes so long for our regulatory agencies to regulate.I would like to give you a few specific examples. Today, in theU.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, which islocated in Scranton, there is an action being continued by the U.S.Government versus York Barbell Co., another organization calledBetter Nutrition Aids; an individual called Bob Hoffman; anotherorganization called Hoffman Laboratories. So far as I could tell, theseare all the same organization. Mr. Hoffman and these other organizations have been marketinga variety of nutritional supplements which they promote by some ofthe advertising methods you have heard about from previous individ-uals, at your hearings. There is much nonsense about their products.This has been going on at least for 10 or 12 years, and yet here is ourGovernment moving 10 or 12 years later against this.The reason I know about this is that on March 6, not too long ago,at the request of the Food and Drug Arministration, I signed an affi-davit regarding this organization which involves fraud, that is, theycommitted the fraud and I signed an affidavit to the effect that it wasfraud. In this connection, in 1945, Doctor George Thorn, who is professorof medicine at Harvard, and I, prepared a paper at the request of theCouncil of Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association,under the title of \"Protein Nutrition in Problems of Medical Inter-est. \"This was published in the Journal of the American Medical As-sociation. A few years after 1945, and I could not tell you exactlyhow many years, this Mr. Hoffman, and these various organizations,lifted this article out of the Journal of the American Medical Associ-ation and put it in a little publication of theirs called \"The ForeignStory.\" They lifted it without my permission, without the permissionof the publisher, the American Medical Association. Not only didthey lift it, but they conveniently left out of their version large por-tions of our articles and they falsified some of our tables by omittingour recommendations and substituting some of their products.You can see these paragraphs marked in red are all part of ouroriginal article which were deleted from their article.Senator FONG. Did they give you credit for it?Dr. STARE. No. They did not give credit and the~y did not ask for it.There are three tables, tables 6, 7, and 8, in their \"Protein Story,\"which are tables 6, 7 and 8 in our article. They omitted in their tablesix, six slices of bread. They left this out and put in their product,which is called in this case, hi-proteen. 31-135--64-pt 3-5288 BEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY In other words, they have taken our article and whatever prestige is associated with being a professor of medicine and a professor of nutri- tion, at Harvard and falsified our table, putting in their product, implying that we are recommending and using their product. When I heard about this, I wrote to the American Medical Associa- tion asking if they had given permission. They replied that they had not, they had never heard of them. So, the AMA lawyers wrote to these various organizations and said, \"Quit doing this. You do not have our permission.\" I do not know whether they have ever stopped, but here it is. Senator WILLIAMS. They, in their piece, were quoting you, then? Dr. STARE. Yes. They were quoting us and quoting us falsely. Senator WILLIAM3S. Then, you got credit really but were abused in the process? Dr. STARE. I mention this only, because, here it is 1964 and the Food and Drug Administration is still getting after these people. In fact, When Doctor Hoffman of the Food and Drug Administration called me a couple of weeks ago about their action, wanting to know if I could come to Scranton to testify, and I could not, and finally settling on this affidavit, I said to him over the phone, \"Why does it take you fellows so long to get going\"? He said, \"I just don't know these people have powerful friends.\" Now, the next example, a somewhat similar one, is correspondence that I have had with our Federal Trade Commission. I think the Federal Trade Commission has done a good job in this area but again it takes so long to move. Here is a sheaf of correspondence dealing with a book written by a person by the name of Gaylord Hauser, the book is called, \"Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall,\" published by Farrar, Straus, and Cudahy. This book is filled with misstatements, with falsehoods, with all kinds of errors and implications. I don't know how long it has been available, my guess would be at least 5 years. Well, the Federal Trade Commission got after the publisher and asked if I would be a witness for them, and I said that l Ivtll e. Thi-s ease, WL astO ULJ~IIC, all'1.- at the last minute it would be postponed. This past fall, I would say sometime in November, just the day before it was to finally come to trial in New York, as usually happens, they throw in the sponge and say, \"The Federal Trade Commission was right,\" and they quit. But in the meantime, they have had a few years to sell this book and get all this nonsense around to the American public. Also during this stalling, they have time to write a similar book, giving the same old nonsense, bringing it up to date, and coming out with it about the time they throw in the sponge on the former book. This has happened-same author, same publisher, only a different title. So here they go again for a few years while the FTC prepares a new case. I could go on like this. Here is a case that involves again the Food and Drug Administration. I think I could say that for the last 10 years I have been involved probably twice a year as a, witness for, or a potential witness for, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Federal Trade Commission. I have had some correspondence with our Post Office as to whether orHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 289 not I would go down to, I think it was Dallas. I am not sure whether it was Dallas or Fort Worth, to appear on their behalf, which I am always willing to do. But it takes time. One thing I think would be helpful is if somebody could figure out a way to speed up some of these things. I don't know whether this is possible or not. My particular interest in this quackery and fraud problem is ob- viously in the area of nutrition, where I have a small amount of competence. The nutritional needs of elderly individuals really do not differ appreciably from those of others. If anything, the nutritional needs of the elderly are less than of a growing organism. By a growing or- ganism I mean an infant or an adolescent. You need less food as you get older. You really need less vitamins. Yet these people who are purveying a lot of these nostrums in the food area do it on the basis that old age has certain unusual nutritional requirements as, for example, increased amounts of vitamins. Actually you do not, you need less vitamins as you get older. Elderly people usually have time to read. I think that is fortunate because reading is one of the pleasures of life, but the food quacks, the charlatans, and the book publishers realize this. They flood the book market with a lot of nonsense about how you can practically live forever if you only have some of their products. In the prepared statement that I gave you I listed 15 books by title, author, and publisher-15 books which I mentioned ought not to be on anybody's bookshelves and really should never have been pub- lished. I would like to call your attention to only one, No. 12, which is entitled, \"Stay Young Longer.\" And I would like to read you just a few of the chapter headings in this book: One chapter is, \"What Makes You Age?\" \"How Long Will it Take to Slow Down Aging?\" \"Are Poisons Making You Old?\" \"Is it \"What Else Ages Us?\" \"Help for rostates.\" These are all problems that concern aging individuals. The author goes on to attack almost all foods because of pesticides and processing, and that is a lot of nonsense. There is not one single case in the medi- cal literature where there is a single individual whose health has ever been impaired by eating any kind of a food product that had pesticides or insecticide residues left on the food product. Now, obviously, pesticides are dangerous. That was why they were made in the first place, to be dangerous to the bugs. True the people who use these pesticides commercially occasionally get into trouble with them, but the point I am trying to make is there is no evidence that anyone who ever walked into a supermarket in Washington, Alabama, Idaho, or Hawaii and bought any kind of food product, became ill because of pesticide or insecticide residue left on that prod- uct, even if they did not use commonsense and wash the product before eating it. So, to scare people saying that you have to buy organically grown food on which no insecticides have been used is only done by those people who have such foods to sell. I think one of our Governmental organizations that has been very lax in permitting a lot of health nonsense to be presented to the Amer- ican public is our Federal Communications Commission.290 0hEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY I do not know whether there are any statutes under which the Fed-eral Communications Commission can do anything about the nonsenseand charlatanism in the nutrition area that comes over our radio andour TV stations. I can mention two specific individuals if you wouldlike to have specific names. I mention them without malice, withouthatred, only as factual information. There is a person who I am sure must be on some Washington tele-vision station each morning doing exercise, a fellow by the name ofJack La Lanne. Well, I think the exercises are fine, but Mr. LaLanne has some nutri-tional supplements, some kind of protein and vitamin preparation.He tries to sell these over his television program to give you muscleslike his. Another individual is a man by the name of Fredericks, who has acanned radio program called, \"Living Can Be Fun.\"I have heard estimates that he is on anywhere from 60 to 120 radiostations. I don't know how many it is. But Mr. Fredericks has noqualifications in the field of nutrition. He is not a physician, not abiochemist, not a nutritionist. He has no qualifications in the field ofhealth. Yet, he talks as though he does have.And he has things that he is trying to sell. I think if one really:wanted to take the time and had money, one could cause a l1t oftrouble for radio stations, prosecuting them on the basis that they arepracticing medicine without a license. But I think our Federal tom-munications Commission has been very lax in permitting health non-sense to go out over our airways. I also have criticism for my own profession, the medical profession,that is. Very frequently you will find that the endorsements on thejackets of books are written by people who put the initials, M.D.,after their names, and worse than that, at least 3 or 4 of the books inthat list of 15 that I included are written by physicians.Actually, in one of these books, one of the biggest quack books, thereis an endorsement written by a former Secretary of Agriculture.I think the American Medical Association has been most lax in nntpublicly disciplining these deceptive disciples of health in their ownprofession. You might wonder why these books are published. This is reallyeconomic. There is an amusing little book you may not have heardof. If you have not, you ought to spend 50 cents and buy it.It is called \"Nuts Among the Berries.\" It is written by a youngman by the name of Ronald Deutsch, published by Ballantine Books;and I have frequently said I think every physician ought to haveseveral copies of this in his office and give them out to many of hispatients. Ronald Deutsch points out in \"Nuts Among the Berries\"that the health fad book with sales of half a million copies will earnover $250,000 in royalties for the author, close to $1 million for thebook sellers, and a half million for the publisher. I think it is a sorrycommentary to report that probably half of the Nation's major bookhouses have succumbed to the lure of health fad book publishing.From the little syndicated column I referred to earlier, I get quite afew letters, many coming from elderly people. I have put down inmy prepared testimony quotations from a typical dozen. I alsobrought along the original letters in case you wish to see them.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 291 Here is a letter that came from Chicago, and it says: DEAR DR. STARE: I am sending a stamped envelope. Please let me know if you can help me. Ihave hardening of the arteries and no circulation. My feet are always numb. I am taking Lufa capsules and heart pills. I would like to know if the Lufa capsules are helping to take the cholesterol out of my blood- stream. I haven't the least idea of what Lufa capsules are. I have never heard of them, but I would bet my last dollar that the claims made for them, and the implications, are all nonsense. Here is another letter, from somebody in Ottawa, Ill.: I have had a thrombosis heart attack 5 years ago. I would like to know if I should take vitamin E capsules. One of the so-called \"health experts\" I referred to, Mr. Fredericks, is frequently trying to sell vitamin E capsules for practically anything under the sun. I am not going to take any more of your time. I did pick a dozen letters out of the hat, you might say. I think they emphasize the fact that there obviously are a lot of elderly people with aches and pains and regardless of how old we are, the older we get, the more aches and pains we are going to have. Also, the older we get, the more interested we are in living to be a little older. So, when you have aches and pains and you go to see your physician, and he tells you, \"I cannot find a thing wrong with you,\" remember that when you get to be 60, 70, 80, that you are going to have a few more aches and pains, and if they bother you too much, why don't you take a couple of aspirin tablets? That does not sound too good to the person who has the aches and pains, even though it is the truth, but if somebody comes along with an advertisement or raps on the door and says, \"I have a preparation called Lufa capsules,\" or Nutribio, or Hi-Protein tablets, or something else, \"and this really will take care of you; look at all these testi- monials. Do you know John Jones who lives down the street not too far, and he says ever since he has been taking this preparation he has been cured.\" This is positive, definite information, and this is what these people seem to like, even though it doesn't do them a bit of good. That is too bad because a lot of money is wasted and sometimes health is impaired. I would say, simply summing up the testimony that I have given, that proper eating to provide more nutrition for elderly individuals or for youngsters, can come from any corner grocery store. In the United States the consumption of health foods, dietary foods, dietary supplements, is a complete waste of money; and many oldsters have no money to waste. Unfortunately, persons of advancing years are good game for the health hucksters with their phoney nutrition advice and books, pamphlets, radio, and television programs. I think our Government must find ways to accelerate the action of the regulatory agencies we have. I think we must also find ways so that the Food and Drug Administration can prosecute these people other than by simply trying to find ways of saying that this product is mislabeled. I believe I am correct in saying that is the only way the Food and Drug Administration can move against these people. Lastly, I do want to state that I think the Food and Drug Adminis- tration and the Federal Trade Commission do a good job but I wish they could do it quicker.292 2HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Thank you. If there are any questions, I will be glad to try to answer them. Senator WILLIAMS. Well, it has been very refreshing and very help- ful. We thank you, Doctor. The Boston Nutrition Society, Inc., does not share our warm feeling of friendship for you. Dr. STARE. I am sure they do not. I am not even sure if that organization exists any more. Senator WILLIAMs. They were the plaintiff in a suit against Fred- rick J. Stare? Dr. STARE. Right. Senator WILLTAMiS. What was that all about? Dr. STARE. It was about an article I had published in McCall's magazine roughly speaking 5 or 6 years ago. It was one of these question-and-answer pieces. McCall's received and selected the questions and sent them to me. One of the questions they selected was something like this: This came from a mother, as I recall, in Barnstable, on Cape Cod, and she said: I have been reading some literature circulated by the Boston Nutrition Society which scares me because it says that the consumption of white bread and white sugar is one of the factors that is largely responsible for the increase in heart diseases and diabetes. Is this true? The reason it scares me is that my children much prefer white bread and they do get plenty of sugar from jelly in jelly-bread sandwiches, and am I going to cause my children to have an early death from heart disease because of feeding them white bread? Well, I answered the questions by saying that those comments are ridiculous. Now, organizations like the Boston Nutrition Society may sound good, but if you were to call them on the telephone as I did when I first heard of them, at the other end of the line it is, \"Copley Square Diet Shop,\" purveyors of health food. I said organizations like the Boston Nutrition Society are, in my opinion, cruel and are defrauding the American people.WA11 sntfl, +1- Z1, -s LC;ht11V;U 11 a suit. Much to my surprise, after two lower courts in Massachusetts had decided that there was no basis for a suit, I was a little bit taken aback when our Supreme Court thought that there were grounds for a suit. And I believe under Massachusetts law that means you have to have a trial before a jury. Eventually, the trial took place. We had decided, the lawyer and myself-the lawyer disturbed me a little bit because he didn't seem to be the least bit interested in this case until shortly before it came to trial, but I must admit I thought he did a very good job. [Laughter.] I say, the opposition, I guess that is the plaintiff, brought a num- ber of professional witnesses; they brought a physician from Texas, by the name of Dr. Joe Nichols. They brought a physician from Chicago whose name I think was Dr. Theron Randolf. They brought a dentist from Altoona. And their testimony was pure nonsense. But my lawyer began to get worried because here were 12 people on the jury and the farther away you get an expert, of course, as you know,HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 293 the more of an expert he is. So, if you bring somebody from Texas he is really an expert. Anyway, my lawyer said that we have to get some witnesses. And I said, \"Why for heavens sake, let's not waste the time of anybody cominM out to testify on this nonsense.\" But about the fifth day he said, 'We have to have some witnesses.\" So I asked my friend, Dr. Paul Dudley White, if he would be good enough to testify on my behalf and he said that he would. He canceled a busy morning's program and came out to appear.After waiting 30 minutes-it was a beautiful golfing day-the judge decided there would not be court that day. Unfortunately, the next day Dr. White could not be there. Dr.Samuel A. Levine came out and appeared on my behalf, and his testi- mony was something to the effect that after practicing cardiology for 50-some years in Boston, to his knowledge, he had never heard of any- one ever being sick from eating any kind of bread, regardless of the color of the bread. Another physician, Dr. George Cahill, testified on diabetes and also that in his opinion it was \"cruel and fraudulent\" to make the claims that had been made by the Boston Nutrition Society. Well, the interesting thing about this trial to me was the charge that Judge Felix Forte made to the jury. He talked to the jury for almost 50 minutes and the essence of his charge was that where else is the public going to get information if they do not get it from people who hold responsible positions in some of our major universities, that these people should speak out and speak frankly and mention names as long as you do not have malice in your heart, so long as you do not have hatred. I had said a dozen times under cross-examination, I couldn't care less about this organization. I had never heard of them before, I couldn't possibly have any malice. I have been quite frank free since then in what I say, and I usually preface my remarks before and after by saying, regardless of what I have said about this or that person I have no malice toward them. I have no hatred toward them. But, I feel that being a person in one of our better health centers I should speak the truth to the best of my ability, and as Judge Forte said, \"Where else is the public going to get the information?\" Senator WILLIAMS. Is that what the judge said? Dr. STARE. I would have to check his exact words but he was quite outspoken. It took the jury 10 minutes, but it took 3 years to exonerate me, and took a fair amount of money. Senator WILLiAMS. The processing of that suit took 3 years? Dr. STARE. Three years. Senator WILLIAMs. Senator Neuberger? Senator NEUBERGER. This brown bread versus white bread reminds me of the old saw about brown eggs are supposed to be more nutritious than white eggs. Dr. STARE. There is nothing to that nor to the other tale that fertile eggs are more nutritious. Senator WnILAM~S. Anything else ? Senator NE'OBiERGER. No, sir. Senator WunIAzr s. Senator Fong? Senator FONG. You must have spent a lot of time thinking about these books you have listed here you say are nonsense. Dr. STARE. They are. And that is by no means an exclusive list.294 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Senator FONG. Now, are there any laws that you know of that will prevent the publication of such a book? Dr. STARE. I do not know of any laws. I have never made any effort to find out and I really do not think, Senator Fong, I would be qualified to interpret any laws if there are any. Senator FoNG. Now, we are entering into a very, very gray section of our study here when you talk about books like these where a fellow says, \"If you take gasoline and you take oil and you rub them on yourjoints, your creaking joints will be all right.\" If he writes a book to that effect, how do you stop a man? Dr. STARE. I think one way you could stop him is if this book iswritten by a physician, and as I said three or four of them that I mentioned are, I think the American Medical Association in great big type in their weekly Journal should come out and castigate this man and throw him out of the organization. But they do not. I might mention I had a little difficulty and it took an exchange of letters to get the American Medical Association to publish an articlethat I wrote about this trial because of the fact that I had mentioned by name two physicians-Nichols and Randolf and the dentist-they wondered whether or not they should mention these people by name. After all, two are members of the club. Senator FoNG. I think you recognize the difficulty in legislating in this field; do you not? Dr. STARE. Yes. But I think that is your job. I don't know how to legislate. Senator FONG. You just present it to us? Dr. STARE. Yes. Senator NEUBERGER. I might say on that line, as you remember yes- terday, the counsel for the AMA said they did go after people who they felt were not professional members. Senator FONG. That is different. This is somebody who writes a book and he says that he believes that white bread is no good for the individual and then how do you bring an action against a man like that? Senator NEUBERGER. That is not verv nrofr.sional. Dr. STARE. I don't know how you bring an action against a person. Senator FoNG. You also stated, Doctor, that it took so long for the Food and Drug Administration to go after some of these charlatans?Dr. STARE. Yes. Senator FONG. The proposal before this committee is that before anything could be marketed, any device could be marketed that these devices be brought before the Federal Food and Drug Administra- tion people. Now, it took so long for them to go after these charlatans. Howlong would it take to pass on whether these devices could be used or not used? Dr. STARE. Let's say a book is going to be published 6 to 12 monthsfrom now and the manuscript is available and it has something to do with the field of health. It should not take an individual who knows anything about this subject more than a few hours to page through the manuscript andknow whether there are many statements in the book that are com- pletely false, wrong, and misleading.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 295 In a way, if some of our publishers had a little higher ethics it would be helpful. But this is a voluntary-I mean, this is a volun- tary compliance. I would think that a publisher like Simon and Schuster which published this crackpot book, \"Calories Don't Count,\" might very well have a medical advisory board and would have sent the manuscript to at least two or three individuals knowledgeable in this field. But, of course, they sold over a million copies and they are in the business of publishing, but what a book to publish. I occasionally get manuscripts from publishers who say, we would appreciate your opinion on this book.\" Sometimes they pay atten- tion to the opinion. But I don't know enough about how you can legislate. We certainly do not want to stifle the freedom of the press, but the press might show more responsibility when dealing with quackery, charlatanism, and fraud in the health area. Senator FoNo. I was referring to some of the devices we saw yester- day. Naturally, those people who manufactured these devices would object very strenuously to the Food and Drug Administration's taking a look at them before they are sold on the market. You say the Food and Drug Administration takes so long in process- ing these things? Dr. STARE. I would assume in testimony you have heard before that somebody has made a point that this is a business with a lot of com- petition. Food faddists are cutting each other's throats to try to get the business. Senator FONG. Would you care to comment on the Seventh Day Adventists, for example, on their food facts? Dr. STARE. I would be glad to. The Seventh Day Adventists that I know, and I know quite a few, are a good group of people. You can be well nourished whether you eat meat or don't, whether you eat white bread, dark bread, or no bread. Most Seventh Day Adventists, as you may or may not know, are what are commonly called lacto-ovovegetarian, which means they drink milk and at eat eggs but they don't eat the flesh of animals; that is, meat. Milk and eggs provide essentially the same nutrients as does meat. Also, Seventh Day Adventists are big consumers of nuts and soybeans, both are good foods and supply many of the same nutrients as meat, so there is nothing wrong with the nutritional principles of the Seventh Day Adventists. Senator FONG. It is medically sound? Dr. STARE. They are medically sound as long as milk and eggs are included in the diet. Senator FONG. I am very glad you made such a statement. I am not a Seventh Day Adventist but a number of my friends are. Dr. STARE. We have had at Harvard a few public Seventh Day Adventist physicians. I know many of them well. They have an excellent medical school in California. I think they have been good leaders in providing good hospital and medical care in other parts of the world. The finest hospital in Bangkok the last time I was there was a Seventh Day Adventist hospital. Senator FONG. Thank you. Senator WILLiAms. You are a dissenter to the theory of the \"Silent Spring,\" I take it?296 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Dr. ST, AR. I rin a dissenter. I think it is lovely rose, beautifdlly written, but it made me wonder whether or not-' The Sea Around Us,\" which was beautifully written, is as accurate as I thought it was at the time I read it. Senator WILLIANES. Thank you very much, Doctor. We are most appreciative. I believe we have been going now for about 2 hours. We better recess briefly for our friend who is taking this record. Senator FoNG. After listening to you, I think I am not going to find enjoyment in reading some of the new books. (Text continued on p. 306.) (Prepared statement of Dr. Stare follows:) PREPARED STATEMENT BY FREDERICK J. STARE, M.D., PROFESSOR OF NuTImTION, CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT OF NUTRITION, HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, BOSTON, MASS. The basic nutritional needs of the elderly are not appreciably different from those of other adults, but the elderly often have nutritional problems. Rarely, these problems are caused by absorptive difficulties. More commonly they are caused by indifference to eating (with resulting poor dietary habits), lack of money to purchase an adequate diet, poor dentures, improper knowledge of what constitutes an adequate diet, and the nutritional misinformation given to them by the hucksters of nutritional quackery. These hucksters include the authors and publishers of food-fad books, and the radio and television programs that permit actors and nutrition commentators to pose as nutrition experts when they are really selling mail-order vitamin and mineral preparations and so-called natural foods. Loneliness, defective hearing, frailty, distance from stores, and lack of de- livery service from most food stores pose real problems in advancing years. In the limited amount of time available, only a few specific problems of nutri- tion in advancing years can be discussed. FLUORIDATION OF WATER SUPPLIES Comment on the fluoridation of public water supplies at first may seem out of place at this meeting, but I assure you it is not. Fluorine is a mineral nutrient we must have to enable us to construct a dental enamel that is maximally resistant to decay. Fluoridation currently offers the only effective means to reduce dental decay by 50 percent or more. Fluori- dated toothpastes are a definite advance in dentifrices. A few neoule will have less decay if they drastically reduce the intake of sugar. Fluorides can be given in pill or drop form, but none of these methods begins to approach fluoridation of water supplies in effectiveness and economy. But why talk about water fluoridation for persons of advancing years? Because the results are permanent. We should not be so shortsighted as to think only of ourselves. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that optimal fluoride ingestion may prove to be helpful in the prevention of osteoporosis, a common disorder of our older citizens. Fewer fractures, and quicker and stronger healing when they do occur, would indeed be a boon to persons of advancing years. Optimal intake of the mineral nutrient, fluoride, throughout life may help to achieve this goal. Thus its pertinence to this discussion. NUTRITION QUACKERY Because Americans are probably the most health-conscious people in the world, nutrition quackery has become one of the smoothest and best organized rackets in the country. Five hundred million dollars is the take from the innocent, according to the American Medical Association. Persons of advancing years are particularly gullible. This springs from the eternal hope of living longer and keeping one's health. Recently, sea water has become popular with the food faddists. This idea originated in Florida and was foisted primarily on old folks. It was based on the ancient but widely held misconception that because sea water contains num- erous mineral and trace elements, and the body needs some of these elements,HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 297 it is healthful to take a little sea water every day. From this premise it is only a step to flagrantly false claims that sea water is a panacea for all the diseases of mankind. Ignored is the fact that the same mineral elements are present in common foods and that, with the possible exception of iodine, they are abund- antly supplied by the ordinary diet. This is just another adaptation of the false premise that modern foods are nutritionally inadequate-a theory that is relied on and prompted by practically all nutrition quacks and food faddists. Much of nutritional quackery is an economic problem, a problem that is par- ticularly acute for many aging persons. According to the 1961 White House Conference on Aging, 75 percent of the people over 65 years of age have a cash income of less than $1,000 a year, and 15 percent have less than $500 a year. It is indeed unfortunate to fritter away any of these meager sums on vitamin and mineral preparations, usually not needed, even if they come from a mail order house at a big discount, and the man on the radio says they may help and he reads many testimonials as to how they helped others. Elderly people usually have time to spare and time to read. This is fortunate because reading is certainly one of the pleasures of life. The health hucksters are aware of this. They realize the hope that exists for a longer, healthier life, and they have gone to town in flooding the book market with nonsense about nutrition. Consider the following quotations from a health food book published recently: \"Replacing heavy starch meals with a low-calorie, high-protein diet lessens the chance of cancer ever attacking you.\" \"Chief among the dietary factors which tend to undermine the health * * * is the use of white sugar and white flour products which * * * place a strain on the heart, the liver, and other vital organs and glands.\" What false and misleading rubbish. One wonders how many innocent and wor- ried persons have followed such advice and hence delayed seeking competent medical advice on personal health problems, perhaps until it is too late. The author of the book from which the foregoing quotations came is a \"health lecturer.\" Here is what he said in a flyer sent through the mails advertising a free lecture entitled, \"Build Health Through Natural Methods\": \"I am going to tell you about the latest scientific and nutritional discoveries that are helping to prevent and overcome colds, catarrh, bronchitis, and hay fever. I have some new and important facts on heart condition, high blood pressure, indigestion, ulcers, gall stones, diabetes, constipation, arthritis, and rheumatism.\" \"Don't miss this free lecturie if you are concerned about your eyes, because I have some new information for you. I am going to show you how to relax and relieve tension * * * how to be free from worry and build up up confidence in yourself. And I have a special message on how to revitalize your glands.

Listen to the chapter headings in book No. 12 entitled, \"Stay Young Longer,\" published in 1961. \"What Makes You Age?\" \"How Long Will It Take To Slow Down Aging ?\" \"Are Poisons Making You Old ?\" \"Is It \"What Else Ages Us?\" \"Help for Prostates.\" The author's attack is that almost all foods are unsafe because of pesticides and processing. She quotes everybody and anybody, including those of \"like kind\" such as Adelle Davis who wrote the foreword and Carlton Fredericks, Ph. D., who is referred to as a \"biochemist and nutritionist.\" Because the Food and Drug Administration and Federal Communications Commission have recently taken action concerning some of the rantings of Carlton Fredericks, he is now boldly proclaiming that he is not a nutritionist-only a nutritional reporter. Sex looms large in this book as in most other books of this type. Here is a quotation from page 277: \"Proteins and organ meats feed the glands. Lecithin (granules) * * * feeds sex glands. Helps liver destroy excess hormones. It is a natural tranquilizer.\" On page 281 we find: \"Vitamin F has been used successfully not only for prostate trouble, but also in cases of high cholesterol and arthritis.\" Who wrote the endorsements of this book on the jacket? Three people who put M.D. after their names, two who have a Ph. D., and a former Secretary of Agriculture. Those of us in the medical profession should be ashamed of some of our fellow physicians who lend the prestige of our great profession to such health nonsense. The American Medical Association has been most lax in not publicly disci- plining these deceptive disciples of health. A couple of years ago one of the bestselling nonfiction books was \"Calories Don't Count.\" It was written by a physician, a gynecologist, and obstetrician. Such training, however, does not necessarily imply any competence in nutrition and biochemistry. A glance at this book reveals how true this is. I would have no complaint were this bestseller on the fiction list. Why do such books continue to appear? Why do respectable publishing houses put out such trash? The answer is to be found in a recently published 50-cent paperback that I recommend. The book is called \"Nuts Among the Berries,\" by Ronald Deutsch, and is published by Ballantine Books, New York. It is an amusing expose of the history of food faddism in this country. Every physician might well keep a supply of this little book on hand and give a copy to each of his elderly patients or anyone who brings up the subject of \"natural foods\" or \"organic gardening.\" This book points out that a health food book with sales of a half million copies will earn over $250,000 in royalties for the author, close to $1 million for book- sellers, and $500,000 for the publisher. It is sad to report that probably half of the Nation's major book houses have succumbed to the lure of health food publishing. For the past 4 years I have had a little syndicated column called \"Food and Your Health.\" This now appears weekly in about 40 newspapers, including the Washington Star. It brings in quite a bit of fan mail, much of it from elderly people. I have brought with me a few sample letters and the requests are typical, Listen to a few: 1. \"Am sending a stamped envelope to please let me know if you can help me. I have hardening of the arteries and no circulation, my feet are numb. I am taking Lufa capsules and heart pills, so I would like to know if the Lufa capsules are helping to take the cholesterol out of my bloodstream. Could you send me to a. doctor to help me with this trouble?\"HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 299 2. \"I had a thrombosis heart attack 5 years ago. My doctor gave me Para- trate to take four times a day. I would like to know if I could also take vitamin E capsules. I have vitamin E capsules; they are 100 Int. units, directions on the bottle say one a day.\" 3. \"Do you have any diet to follow for arthritis that will help it at all, any certain foods to eat?\" 4. \"Within 1 year I had a cataract operation in each eye. I started to get dizzy. I am taking medication but don't seem to get any better. I am in my early sixties, should I go to an ear doctor? How long should this last?\" 5. \"In older folks will you please advise what causes heavy bagginess to form under eyes suddenly? Kidneys check OK.\" 6. \"True that I'm overweight but the doctor will not give me any type of medication to help reduce. Is it true that reducing pills weaken one's blood and blood vessels? Also, what can one eat or do to strengthen these vessels and improve the blood? Like the older folks believed that certain foods were excellent tonics.\" 7. \"Please advise me what I should do about my hair. It seems to be getting much thinner than when I was younger. If I need vitamins, please advise what is best for my problem.\" 8. \"Is it a good thing to take a few tablets of Lecithin tablets daily although I am 25 pounds overweight and 59 years of age (male) ? Would the Lecithin tablets put on more weight since they are a food?\" 9. \"I have hardening of the arteries and am on a low-fat diet and would like a list of foods that don't have cholesterol. How is pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds ?\" 10. \"I am living alone and being old it does not pay preparing the fresh vegetables, like spinach, carrots. I 'ask you whether or not canned vegetables have the same amount of vitamins and minerals as the fresh ones? I was and am taking vitamin tablets for many years, maybe 20 years.\" 11. \"By taking vitamin E capsules every day, is it possible to dissolve cysts or lumps in the breast? If possible, I would appreciate an answer as soon as possible.\" 12. \"I read somewhere that drinking safflower oil or other unsaturated oils will take off pounds when reducing. Is this true? How much oil is used? How often is it taken?\" SUMMARY Proper eating to provide proper nutrition for oldsters, youngsters, or the middle aged, can be achieved from the wise selection of foods available in ordi- nary grocery stores. Consuming health foods or dietary supplements is not necessary. For most people these so-called health foods and dietary supple- ments are a waste of money, and many oldsters have no money to waste. Unfortunately, persons of advancing years are good game for the health huck- sters with their phony nutrition advice in books, pamphlets, radio, and television. Enrichment of certain basic foods-the addition of three key vitamins and one mineral to flour, iodine to salt, vitamin D to milk, vitamin A to margarine, and fluoride to water-has been most important in bringing better health to both young and old. Variety and moderation in food consumption are the keys to proper nutrition. Eat less to live longer, to accomplish more, and to enjoy your children and grandchildren longer. BosTow NuTRaTroN SOCIETY, INC., PLAINTIFF v. FREDRICK J. STARE, DEFENDANT (By Fredrick J. Stare, M.D., Boston) The defendant maliciously, intending to defame the plaintiff and subject it to hatred, ridicule, and contempt, * * * falsely, maliciously, willfully, wrongfully, * * * published * * * a fake, wicked, malicious, defamatory, and scandalous libel * * *. These harsh words, with their interesting adjectives, originated by the Boston Nutrition Society, were delivered to me the first Monday in July 1959. The basis for this libel suit was an answer I had prepared to a question received from the editorial staff of Mcfall's Magazine and which was to appear in the March, 1957, issue as part of a question-and-answer column. 31-135-64--it. 3-6300 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY The complete question and my answer were as follows: \"Q. I am enclosing a clipping from an 'open letter' from the Boston Nutrition Society that is really frightening: 'The enriched white bread fed to the American public is a national scandal. First of all, the wheat grown on poor soil and fertilized with water-soluble commercial fertilizer is of low-protein content. * * * The modern flour mill removes the precious vitamins and minerals. This is then bleached with a powerful oxidizing agent, chlorine dioxide (which is a poison) ; and to this lifeless mess, a few dead synthetic chemicals (improperly called vitamins) and inorganic iron are added. * * * We not only think these foodstuffs are worthless; we believe that many of them are positively harmful. * * * We know that we are a Nation of sick people. Our hospitals are crowded to capacity. All the metabolic diseases are increasing by leaps and bounds. Coronary throm- bosis is attacking young men in their twenties. Cancer is the leading cause of death in children under 14. Diabetes and mental disease are on the increase, even in children. And dental cavities are rampant.' Since two of my boys refuse to eat any but white bread, I am naturally terribly concerned. Is there any connection between white bread and all these diseases? Barnstable, Mass.\" \"A. These scare tactics are typical of the food-faddist organizations. The name 'Boston Nutrition Society' sounds good, but, if you were to telephone them, you would discover, as we did, that the phone number is the same as for the Copley Square Diet Shop, purveyors of so-called health foods. The faddists want you to believe that the food industry is forcing white bread down the throats of the American public. However, for centuries the majority of man- kind has preferred white bread. It is still the overwhelming favorite. Despite the efforts to 'sell' whole wheat flour, the sale of dark flours has remained essentially the same, about 2 or 3 percent of the total output. From a practical viewpoint in most American diets, dark flour and enriched white flour are the same in food value and they both make important contributions to our diet. To imply or suggest that enriched white flour can cause or contribute to the diseases listed in the clipping is a cruel and reckless fraud. The Food and Drug Adminis- tration of the Federal Government is an eternal watchdog safeguarding the food you eat. Moreover, the legitimate food industries contribute millions of dollars to research in their own laboratories, and to lesser extent, grants and aids to universities. Many large food concerns publish some of our best nutrition education.\" PREPARATION FOR TRIAL Originally it seemed strange to me that I, rather than McCall's was being sued. But I soon learned that a plaintiff has the choice of suing either the publisher, or author, or both. In suing me it was quite evident that the Boston Nutrition Society was more interested in quieting me as a critic of food quackery, faddism, and nutrition nonsense than in being awarded a large cash award. .Irl due~V welV any anr, co the eASe, -eb;n6 up Sue ac.Lusc -f fai. CUenU on a matter of public interest and truth, was filed with the court, At the same time, my counsel filed a motion to dismiss. This motion was heard before a Massachusetts superior court judge upon arguments of both counsel only, and the motion allowed. However, the plaintiff society then appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which, as to two of the four specified libels, overruled the superior court, indicating that the, case, as to those two items (\"cruel and reckless fraud\" and the statement concerning the society's connec- tion with the diet shop) should be submitted to a jury for its consideration. The court did not pass on the fair comment defense, since that was a matter for the jury. Finally, on September 5, 1962, the trial commenced before Judge Felix Forte of the superior court and a jury in my home county court of Dedham, Mass. PLAINTIFF'S wITNESSES The Boston Nutrition Society used against me a total of five witnesses; -two lay people and three professional witnesses. The testimony of all three professional witnesses was that \"natural foods\" are far superior for health than ordinary foods. Much of the illness of mankind today, they said, is due to our poor \"devitalized foods\" and the residual poisons contaminating our foods as a result of the use of pesticides, insecticides, and \"additives.\" Present in the courtroom for part of the trial and conferring with the plain- tiff's counsel, but not appearing as a witness, were Dr. W. Coda Martin, a physi- cian from Beverly Hills, Calif., and Andrew G. Rosenberger, of Wellesley Hills,HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 301 Mass., a well-known food faddist whose brother is president of Nature Food Centres, Inc., of Cambridge, Mass. Rosenberger and his brother were recently fined $5,000 each, given a 6-months suspended prison sentence, and placed on probation for 2 years in a case involving alleged misbranding of health foods under the Food and Drug Act, which convictions were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals.Highlights of the plaintiffs case against me were as follows: The first witness was Cyril C. Sullivan, president of the Boston Nutrition Society. He claimed to have only a poor recollection of what went on at meetings of the society. He said that the society sold some books, one being \"Arthritis and Common Sense.\" Sullivan testified that he and counsel for the society had demanded of me a retraction of the statement in the McCall's article but that I had refused. The second lay witness was Mrs. Gladys Pearmain who said she had been president of the Boston Nutrition Society from 1956 to 1958. On direct examina- tion, Mrs. Pearmain said that one of the tenets of the organization was use of naturally grown foods. On cross-examination, Mrs. Pearmain said that It is a premise of the Boston Nutrition Society that enriched white bread and enriched white flour are at least contributing causes of cancer, mental disease, and heart trouble. Cross-examination of Mrs. Pearmain brought out the fact that she believed that I was one of the leading opponents of her colleagues in the nature food business. In educational qualifications, Mrs. Pearmain claimed to hold a \"certificate in vitamins\" but neither attorney was able to find out exactly what she meant by the term. Theron G. Randolph, M.D., of Chicago, was the first professional witness. Counsel for the plaintiff tried to give him an opening to deliver a lecture on organically grown foods, and more particularly on pesticide-free foods. Dr. Randolph claimed to have found patients with allergic reactions to \"treated\" or insecticide-sprayed wheat who did not react allergically to \"organically grown\" wheat products. Dr. Randolph was asked by plaintiff's counsel to talk broadly on the effects of DDT on people; to this my counsel objected and was supported by the judge. Upon thus being limited to discussing the proposition at hand; that is, the relationship of enriched white bread and white flour to the various diseases listed in the complaint that was the subject for libel, Dr. Randolph was unable to contribute materially to the plaintiff's case. The second professional witness was a dentist from Altoona, Pa., Dr. Fred D. Miller, vice president of Natural Foods Associates. Dr. Miller's testimony was rambling. My counsel and Judge Forte attempted with only partial success to limit his testimony to the subject at hand. On cross-examination, Dr. Miller was asked about a book he had written, \"Open Door to Health.\" He was asked if this book had not had several critical passages concerning me, and Miller admitted that it had. In answer to questions, Miller said that he teaches his patients that they should eat only fertile eggs and that they are better off if they will eat only raw meat and natural foods. The last and apparently main witness for the Boston Nutrition Society was Joe D. Nichols, M.D., of Atlanta, Tex., who has practiced medicine there since 1936 and, in partnership with his brother, owns and operates the only hospital in Atlanta, Tex. He testified to being president of the Natural Food Associates for the past 9 years and said that this is essentially a layman's oragnization with professional medical guidance designed to teach conservation of food and soil. He said they try to teach the values of natural foods and secondly to help the believer find such natural foods, which he characterized as creating a \"demand\" and a \"supply.\" Nicholas went on at one point in his testimony to claim that the vitamin D added to enriched white bread is actually poisonous and that there has been considerable evidence of the toxicity of this vitamin. Later, on cross-examination, Nichols was asked if he knew whether or not vitamin D was always or even usually added to enriched white bread. To this question Nichols finally answered that he didn't know actually if it was added. (It is an optional ingredient and usually is not added.) Dr. Nichols expounded on something he called the concept of totality. His diatribe against enriched white flour and degerminated wheat products was part of his whole concept which included the use of natural foods grown on organically fertilized soils. In answer to specific questions by plaintiff's counsel regarding a relationship of enriched white flour and bread to \"metabolic diseases\" and coronary throm- ..~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~302 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY bosis, Nicholas said that these disorders are related to the use of enriched devitalized foods. Nichols claims that one cannot get a well-balanced diet in the normalAmerican food market. He said it is difficult to find the natural foods neces- sary. On cross-examination, Nichols admitted that he was organizer of a corpora- tion set up to sell natural foods. He claimed that it had not to date madeany profit, but that it was organized as a profitmaking corporation to promote sale of products of the type grown on his farm. He admitted that he had made no controlled experiments of any kind and that his opinions are based only on his observations. Nichols did not know what the quantity of protein in flour is; further, he did not know the amounts of calcium, phosphorus, iron, thiamine, riboflavin, orniacin in bread, nor did he know much else about the composition of bread. He also did not know what part in the usual American diet is comprised of bread.. Nichols said that in his treatment of heart disease, thrombosis, cancer, and diabetes, diet would be the main part of his therapy. He was asked what diet he would use and he said that he would simply prescribe natural foods. He claimed that if one lives on natural foods, the quantity consumed is self-limiting and obesity is readily avoided. Dr. Nichols said that his main reasonfor interest in this case came from objections to being called a quack. The judge then asked him if the defendant had called him a quack and to. this he reluctantly said, \"No.\" For 2 days the court and jury heard testimony of the plaintiff's witnesses. It developed that all three professional witnesses were also members of an organization they described as a \"scientific\" society known as the InternationalInstitute of Clinical Physiology. This too was organized by Dr. Nichols who was its president. The society publishes its own journal known as Clinical Physiology. Dr. Jonathan Foreman of Columbus, Ohio, serves as editor-in- chief, and the three witnesses for the Boston Nutrition Society are all listed as associate editors. Then I was called to the stand by the plaintiff's lawyer,and he and my own lawyer examined and reexamined me for a long day. DEFErNDANT'S WITNESS Dr. Paul Dudley White was to be a witness in my behalf and appeared at the courthouse, where, after waiting one-half hour, we were informed that court would not be held that day. As Dr. White could not appear the following day, Dr. Samuel A. Levine and Dr. George Cahill appeared as my witnesses. Dr. Levine testified that in his nearly 50 years of practicing medicine and in his specialty of cardiology, he had never seen a single case of any kind of illnessthat seemed to have been caused by eating bread of any kind or color. Dr.Onhill's testimony was siilar. Further, he testified that he thought it \"Cruel\" for individuals to make statements that common, serious disease might result from eating bread when there is not an iota of scientific evidence to support such statements. It is of interest, land may be helpful to some in the future, to read portions of Judge Felix Forte's charge to the jury. Editing for brevity is indicated byasterisks, and the words in parentheses have been added for clarity. THE JUDGE'S CH1 ARGE \"Whenever there is a controversy between two parties, * e * that * * e cannot be adjusted amicably, then * * * the party who claims to be injured * * * can appeal to that department of government that (has) to do with theadministration of justice * * *. \"You were selected as disinterested, impartial citizens ready to give fullconsideration to all the evidence that has been presented. Now you haveheard all the evidence. You have heard all the witnesses. You have heardarguments of counsel. Of course, what the lawyers say is not evidence. Thelawyer makes a statement that should not be considered by you as proof; forthat he should take the witness stand. But, he's necessary because by his argument, his presentation of the evidence in his argument, he tries to bring out all the strong points of his side and all the weak points of the other side. \"* * * What is meant by libel? It is a defamatory statement affecting thereputation of the plaintiff. It is distinguished from slander. Slander is oral, where libel is in a more permanent form such as writing.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 303 \"Your first question that is going to be submitted to you is whether the defendant did publish defamatory statements about the plaintiff as distin- guished from expression of his own honest opinion different from the viewpoint and the tenets and the way of thinking of the plaintiff. * * * \"On page 3 in this letter (exhibit), there is included a statement attributed to Dr. Joe D. Nichols, who took the stand here. * * * He refers to the fact that he has been called a quack. He hasn't charged the defendant with calling him a quack. (The Nichols' statement) says: 'The modern flour mill removes the precious vitamins and minerals. This is then bleached with a powerful oxidizing agent, chlorine dioxide (which is a poison) ; and to this lifeless mess, a few dead synthetic chemicals (improperly called vitamins) and inorganic iron are added.' \"And the writer of the article (Dr. Stare) insinuates that this kind of flour has as much food value as natural, organically-grown, unbleached, stone- ground flour. * * * \" 'The tragedy of our times is that too many so-called experts are teaching false- hoods. * * * In some instances, commercial interests have penetrated our uni- versities and have driven the truth from our classrooms. * * 5' \"That is the beginning of this controversy because in the (McCall's) article c * * the defendant is asked to comment on the (Nichols') statement. \"* * * here is the question (an individual sent to McCall's for Dr. Stare to answer) : 'I am enclosing a clipping from an open letter from the Boston Nutrition Society that is really frightening. \"The enriched white bread fed to the American public is a national scandal.\" These are not the words of the defendant These are the words of the plaintiff. Ten thousand five hundred copies of them were distributed and a copy addressed to the President of Har- vard University. \"Now, whoever invites public discussion on a public question shouldn't be disappointed if he is answered equally forcibly in the opposite way, so long as there is no malice. This is how this controversy started. \"'First of all, the wheat grown on poor soil and fertilized with water-soluble commercial fertilizer is of low protein content. Then, while in storage, it is sprayed with poison DDT to control the insects. \"'The modern flour mill removes the precious vitamins and minerals. This is then bleached with a powerful oxidizing agent chlorine dioxide (which is a poison) ; and to this lifeless mess, a few dead synthetic chemicals (improperly called vitamins) and inorganic iron are added. * * * We not only think these foodstuffs are worthless; we believe that many of them are positively harm- ful. * * * \"'We know that we are a nation of sick people.

Cancer is the leading cause of death in children under 14. Diabetes and mental diseases are on the increase even in children. And dental cavities are rampant.\"' That is the end of the quotation. \"What did * * * (Dr. Nichols) intend to say by that statement? That I am going to put to you. He intended to convey the idea that bread, modern flour, from which precious vitamins and minerals have been removed; modern flour that has been bleached with a powerful oxidizing agent, chlorine dioxide (which is a poison) : modern flour which he calls a lifeless mess to which a few dabs of synthetic chemicals, improperly called vitamins, and inorganic iron are added- he means that these diseases were causually connected with this type of bread and modern flour. This mother, who believes the statement, worried because her children won't eat anything but white bread. \"Now, there is your first question. What do you understand by that state- ment? * * * Do you understand that he meant to say merely that * * * white bread is only one of the many causes, one of the many reasons why our hospitals are crowded, or did he mean to convey to the reader that white bread is the cause, the cause of the disease? Because, if the doctor who wrote that conveyed the idea that white bread was the cause of these diseases, he was on the witness stand (and said) he didn't intend to say that-he admitted that would be a false statement. He only meant to say it was one of the causes * * * a child gets sick even if he eats too much ice cream. \"In the light of what * * * you understand * * * then judge the defendant's statement. The first statement of * * * (Dr. Stare) : 'These scare tactics are typical of the food-faddist organizations.' That is a general statement. That is304 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY not libelous in any sense. 'The name \"Boston Nutrition Society\" sounds good.' That also is not libelous in any sense. 'But, if you were to telephone them, you would discover, as we did, that the phone number is the same as for the Copley Square Diet Shop, purveyors of so-called health foods.'\" Did * * * (Dr. Stare) mean by that to * * * convey the idea (that) the whole purpose and activity of the Boston Nutrition Society is to help this little business known as the health shop? That the Boston Nutrition Society is used as a tool in order to enhance the business of the foodshop? If that is so, it would be defamatory. * * * It would tend to prejudice (the) Boston Nutrition Society in public estimation and thereby to interfere with the conduct of its activities to promulgate the value (I assume) of natural foods. * * * But, even if that is a libelous statement, Mr. Foreman and members of the jury, you are not going to give to much attention to that feature of this case because it is admitted to be the truth that both concerns had the same number. And so, the statement was not false. With libel, truth is a defense. \"I am leading up to the real issue in this case * * * \"If a person is a highway robber and I write that he is a highway robber, as a citizen, that is libelous. But, if it turns out to be true, that he is a highway robber, then truth is a defense. However, I have a right, the right of truth, to write about another no matter how defamatory it is so long as my motives are proper. If I do it maliciously-not for the common good, not merely to express my honest opinion but in order to injure that particular person for spite, and all the other adjectives that are used here in the plaintiff's declaration, then I for- feit that defense of truth. \"* * * we allow truth to be a defense. But, it is only a defense as long as the defendant did not act maliciously and was not prompted by malice. Not prompted by a sense of revenge, spite, deliberate intent to do damage, to injure, malign- a person for no other reason. * * * \"Now, the other statement (of Dr. Stare) which I have to put to you as to whether it was defamatory (reads as follows). * * * 'To imply or suggest that enriched white flour can cause or contribute to the diseases listed in the clipping is a cruel an reckless fraud.' \"If the defendant stated that in the abstract, if he intended to state that in the abstract * * * he had a right to say it. He had a right to express his opinion and it would not be defamatory because it wasn't directed at the plaintiff cor- poration, Boston Nutrition Society. The plaintiff, however, * * * brought this action because (he maintains) that statement was directed at the plaintiff. \"* * * (Do you believe) that * * * (Dr. Stare) directed such a statement at the Boston Nutrition Society in the matter of public interest? When anyone seeks public approval of his own pet idea, of his own talents, of his own ability * * * whenever he solicits public approval he shouldn't complain if he receives disapproval in return. A correlation to that is that every individual has a privilege to exnress his oninion on matters of -nhlic InMerest. The pub icht as . interest in the matter and the more discussion, the more controversy, the better for the public because ultimately the truth wins out. \"That's the basis of our whole Government. Right from the time almost of the Declaration of Independence and embodied in our Constitution. This is a matter of public interest. \"0 * * (Dr. Stare) had a privilege to say and write everything he did. * * * He had the privilege to do so. In fact, we should encourage all opinions and different views-plaintiff's as well as defendant's here to discuss these matters in public because who is not interested in food from the standpoint of human health? He had the privilege to express himself and he had the privilege to say and write what he did * * * if he entertained no ill will. In other words, had no malice. \"So the whole case boils down to that one issue. First, was the second state- ment defamatory or not, and if it was, did the defendant entertain malice toward the plaintiff. I can't help you on that. You have the last word and the question of belief. The (Boston Nutrition Society) wants you to infer malice here. (Dr. Stare) must have acted maliciously, otherwise he wouldn't have written as he did. And (Dr. Stare) said no, he had no ill will toward them. That is why you are here. You have to decide who to believe and who not to believe. Twelve heads are better -than one. * * * The burden of proof is on the plaintiff. If, in your minds, the scales are evenly balanced, you don't know whether the de- fendant was prompted by malicious thoughts or not or whether he acted honestly in carrying out what be thought was his duty for the * * * common good, andHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 305 the scales are evenly balanced, then you have to find against the plaintiff. If the plaintiff has failed to convince you to that extent, then the plaintiff has failed to sustain its burden of proof and is not entitled to a verdict. * * * \"If the defendant acted maliciously, ibring in a verdict for at least $1. How much more depends on how much proof the plaintiff has produced * * * in the form of evidence as to how much it has suffered as a result of this particular alleged libel. * * * \"Now truth as well as privilege are only conditional defenses. They are good if not contaminated by malice. If a privilege was exercised or prompted by actual malice-I have explained the ordinary meaning of malice, ill feeling, improper motive, intent to injure plaintiff in its activities, and so forth-then the defendant loses that privilege of that defense of truth, loses that defense of privilege.\" The jury deliberated for about 15 minutes and acquitted me, the defendant, of any intent to libel the Boston Nutrition Society. PRIVILEGE AND DUTY OF PHYSICIAN What practical points can we who wish to speak clearly and firmly in the combat of quackery and food faddism learn from Judge Forte's charge? Truth, he says, is a defense of libel as long as it is not said with intent to harm, but rather to inform. A professional person, he says, has a privilege in his field of competence to differ with others supposedly in the same field, to speak out and speak strongly, as long as his comments are not made with malice. Before the annual meeting of the Harvard Medical Alumni, June 1, 1962, I made a sincere statement. Having recently survived a libel suit, I will repeat it. \"I have always felt that professors in our schools of medicine and public health, and other leaders in the health professions, are falling down on the job if they don't speak out clearly and emphatically on health quackery and nonsense, be it food faddism, antifluoridation propaganda, or 'cancer cures.' \" This paper was submitted to Judge Forte for his comments before it was sub- mitted for publication. He wrote as follows: \"I may add that there is a very interesting and edifying opinion on free speech, apart from the decisions I men- tioned in my charge, in the case of Terminnello v. the United States, in volume 337 of the U.S. Reports at page 1. This is a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States explaining what is meant by free speech. There you will find that free speech serves its high purpose when it induces a condition of un- rest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.\" JAMA EDITORIALs QUACKEY QUAKES \"Whoever invites public discussion on a public question shouldn't be dis- appointed if he is answered equally forcibly in the opposite way, so long as there is no malice.\" This comment of Superior Court Judge Felix Forte is extended elsewhere in this issue (p. 635) in a special communication which car- ries an unusual report of what one physician did. No one looks forward to a suit for libel. It takes one's time, costs money, and really is a nuisance. But such suits do happen. What should the physician do when he is asked to comment on a specific problem in the area of health, when there appears to be quackery or faddism involved? Fredrick J. Stare, M.D., professor of nutrition at Harvard and winner of the AMA's Goldberger Award in Clinical Nutrition in 1962, was asked to comment on a statement published by an organization called the Boston Nutrition Society. The statement was actually one by Joe D. Nichols, M.D., of Atlanta, Tex., to the effect that present-day enriched white bread is \"worthless\" and may be \"positively harmful.\" It was implied that coronary artery disease, cancer, diabetes, mental disease, and dental caries were importantly related to the consumption of enriched white bread. Stare answered publicly, in the opposite way, and \"equally forcibly.\" He wrote: \" * * to imply or suggest that enriched white flour can cause or con- tribute to the diseases listed is a cruel and reckless fraud.\" The Boston Nutrition Society sued. Stare fought the suit, and successfully. The testimony of the three professional witnesses for the Boston Nutrition Society was that \"natural foods\" are far superior for health than ordinary foods. Much of the illness of mankind today, they said, is due to our poor306 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY \"devitalized foods\" and the residual poisons contaminating our foods as aresult of the use of pesticides, insecticides, and \"additives.\" As supporting witnesses, Stare had S. A. Levine, M.D., and George Cahill, M.D. Levine testified that in his nearly 50 years of practicing medicine, and in his specialty of cardiology, he had never seen a single patient with any kind of illness that seemed to have been caused by eating bread of any kind or color. Cahill's testimony was similar. Further, he testified that he thought it \"cruel\" for individuals to make statements that common, serious disease mightresult from eating bread, when there is not an iota of scientific evidence to support such statements.In his instructions to the jury, Judge Forte emphasized that truth is a defense for libel, but a defense only as long as the defendant did not act maliciously and was not prompted by malice. The judge stated that we should encourage all opinions and all different views-plaintiff's as well as defendant's-because who is not interested in food from the standpoint of human health? There are practical points that all physicians can gain from this interesting case: Speak clearly and firmly in the combat of quackery and food faddism. Speak without malice to any individual or society but with the physician's responsibility to inform his patient or society of the truth as he sees it in theimportant area of health where the physician has special qualifications. Senator WITm s. I think we can reconvene. Dr. Dena Cederquist, I am happy to say, is with us. Dr. Ceder- quist is chairman of the Food and Nutrition Department of the Col- lege of Home Economics at Michi-an State University. We welcome you, Dr. Cederquist, and very much look forward to your statement. STATEMENT OF DR. DENA C. CEDERQUIST, SCHOOL OF HOME ECONOMICS, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY Dr. CEDERQUIST. Thank you, Senator Williams, Senator Neuberger. You have before you a printed statement and I would just like to refer to a few excerpts from this rather than read the entire statement in the interest of saving time. I might identify myself first of all. I am chairman of the Foods Nutrition Department at Michigan State University. I have a Ph. D. degree, like Dr. Stare, from the same school, in biochemistry andnutrition. T have been A. iniversity researcher and professor fo 20 years, getting close to 25. My interests in nutrition frauds and misrepresentation stems from responses received both verbally and written from talks and television appearances. These indicate a great number of persons are confused and misinformed with respect to the adequacy of the food supply in this country. For the one person who is speaking the truth in this area of nutri- tional adequacy there seem to be several hundred at work raising doubts and fears in the minds of the average citizen. Our senior citizens represent an ever increasing number of indi- viduals who seem to be most vulnerable to the pitch of the food fad- dist. You have before you the estimates of the numbers of these indi- viduals who will be a part of the population up to the year 1970. The Home Economics Research Report No. 20: Family Food Plan and Food Costs, U.S. Department of Agriculture, presents informa- tion on the quantities of foods which should be purchased each week to meet the food needs of persons aged one to 75 or over. This organization has prepared lists of foods, pound averages, and so forth, for persons one through 75 or older, recommending theHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 307 amount of food which should be purchased. Based on the food cost for October 1963, I have presented these estimates at the low cost plan, the moderate plan, and the liberal plan. Thus a man and woman in the age bracket 55 to 74 years would need approximately $11.58 per week, or $598 per year to buy the food nec- essary to meet their recommended nutrient needs-based on the Octo- ber 1963 food costs. I would like to underline what Dr. Stare said, it is fairly well estab- lished that after adolescence there are no specific requirements related to age, and there certainly is no evidence which suggests older people require larger amounts of any specific nutrient than do younger adults. A report on the diets of older persons indicates that most of them selected a nutritionally good diet, and where the diet was not ade- quate the intake of recommended nutrients could readily be corrected by the use of small amounts of milk, cheese, citrus fruits, bread, and cereals. There certainly was no evidence that large increases in food purchases were necessary. What then is the problem? In my opinion we have several million persons who have reached the age of 65 or older without the benefit of a sound education in the facts related to nutrition. Actually nutri- tion is a new science and many persons have reached adulthood with- out the benefit of training in this area of learning- These persons have been led to believe the Moods produced in this country are neither safer nor adequate and that special food supple- ments at exorbitant prices must be purchased if a person is to remain in good health. I have quoted directly from some of the books to which Dr. Stare referred and I believe for time's sake, I will not repeat these, but I would like to point out my concern. Persons with limited incomes are made to feel it is not possible to obtain an adequate diet from simple, inexpensive foods. This leads to the purchase of expensive, unnecessary and in many instances, use- less products. (Except in a small percentage of persons in the lowest income group where funds are insufficient to procure an adequate diet, a mixed vitamin capsule has no utility other than placebo effect, nor can such a capsule substitute effectively for a nutritious diet.) Elderly persons are often led to believe the afflictions of old age are dietary in origin and thus indulge in self-medication with dietary nostrums rather than seek medical diagnosis and care. The delay in seeking medical care may prove costly in terms of time, money, and life. There seems to be no control over the publication and distribution of false claims with respect to nutrition information. I question the use of the word \"information.\" Any person who eats can, without fear of censorship, call himself a nutritionist, a dietician, or even a \"doctor.\" I picked out of Adelle Davis' book, \"Let's Eat Right and Keep Fit,\" a statement where she says outright: Without any specialized training, any organization, or any particular leader- ship, without one cent of tax money or without even any work but just a lot of fun, we can collectively solve this problem of America's malnutrition. It is obvious to me that the \"we\" referred to in the quote have no training but are willing to admit nothing stands in the way of their fraudulent activities.308 1iTALTm FRAUDS AND QUACKERY And finally, I would like to ask, when is some sort of protection going to be afforded the person who is capable, willing, and honestly attempting to both educate and protect the citizens of these United States?I would like to turn to the summary sheet and briefly state the following: I believe it is an established fact there is an adequate sup- ply of food available in this country; that adequate diets can be pur- chased within the fair means of citizens; and that great numbers of citizens have been made to feel insecure. With time on their hands to sit and think, and as Dr. Stare suggests, read, they are misled by misinformation. They have time to think about themselves and how they feel, and they have been led to spending considerable amounts of money for unnecessary food supplements, and I thought you might be interested in three examples of the cost of certain supplements. We obtained the manufacturers analysis of a protein supplement which costs 19 cents per day taken in the prescribed amount. When we compared the nutritive value of these pills with dried skimmed milk, the nutritive value of the pills was about the same as that found in one-half cent's worth of dried skimmed milk, and the similarityof the components of the tablet and the milk made one wonder if they were not the same product. Another supplement costs $5.50 per month or approximately $2.75 per week for two elderly people. If you add this to the $11.50 low- cost food plan I suggested, this would increase the cost of the foodby 24 percent. If this supplement were used, the concentration ofcertain nutrients, particularly vitamins A and D would be available in amounts six times the recommended intake. Evidence is accumu-lating that these two vitamins in large doses are toxic. And finally, the vitamin E to which Dr. Stare referred is widely distributed in ordinary food. We have not been able to find a docu- mented case of E deficiency in man, yet many E supplements are being offered for sale. For example, 100 tablets costing $2.95 would cost an individual about 12 cents a day for something that is unnecessaryanda pareon oir the faod. My suggestion is for action. Is there any means available whereby the U.S. mail service could control or limit the distribution of false and misleading advertising with respect to the food supplements, or sale of food supplements? Jut this week this little catalog came up across my desk. It offers for sale something between 150 and 180 different items, none of which are necessary in the diet. Senator WILT TrIs. Whose work is that, Doctor? Dr. CEDERQUIST. This is put out by the Natural Sales Co. In this issue, skin and body aids are also advertised. Mr. Lawrence Vinton is the director of Nutrition Natural Sales Co. Then I also would suggest that we give greater support to the Food and Drug Administration in its activities. Help them to move faster and make the penalties more severe. Then, could the legal counsel of the Food and Drug Administration be made available on a friend-of-the-court basis to assist individuals who are in no financial position to defend themselves. For example, in my teaching and work with lay groups, I would like to be able toHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 309 identify a product by name and make a critical evaluation of thisproduct. If the manufacturer disagreed with my evaluation, he could take his case to court. If I could appeal to the Food and Drug Administration and they in turn would assume the responsibility for the trial, in my opinion fewer of these cases would ever come to court. I would like to call to your attention a paper that was presented by Dr. Kenneth Milstead whose official title I am sorry I do not have, but I believe he is Director of Enforcement in the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Milstead presented a clear, concise, descriptive paper relative to food faddism at the American Dietetic Association meeting in Miami in October of 1962. He submitted this paper for publication first to the Journal of the American Dietetic Association and secondly to the Journal of the American Medical Association, and both organizations refused to pub- lish it, a aper full of facts. They refused to publish it for fear of bein ha ed into court in one of these long, drawn out lawsuits that Dr. Stare was talking about, and so this very valuable bit of informa- tion which should have gone to all practicing dietitians in the United States, and could well have been read by all physicians, was not made available for publication. Senator WILLIAMS. Are you a member of the American Dietetic Association? Dr. CEDERQUIST. Yes; I am, sir. Senator WILLIAMS. Without objection at the end of your statement, I would like to put a statement in the record from your association. Dr. CEDERQUIST. I think that you would find if you look through the Journal of the American Dietetic Association a rather critical article or statement, that was made by Miss Adelia Beeuwkes from the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, who is a past president of the American Dietetic Association. Miss Beeuwkes made a statement relative to some of the authors that Dr. Stare re-ferred to and it is my understanding after this review was printed in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, they were threat- ened with the kind of lawsuits the association felt it could not afford to take. So Miss Beeuwkes retracted the truth, and this is the position in which I find myself as an employee of the State. My salary is paid by the State of Michigan to teach, and yet on advice of our lawyer at the university, I did not write a criticism of the book, \"Calories Don't Count,\" for he said I would be liable and we simply could not affordthis kind of thing. So we find ourselves talking in generalities while the food faddist comes out and says, if you do t~lis you will be cured, and I, in generali- ties, avoid the issue. Senator WILLIAMS. You had better go back and tell the lawyer to read the testimony of Dr. Stare. Dr. CEDERQUIST. Yes; I am extremely interested in this, because I assure you none of this is done with malice in my heart. The facts are, we do have a good food supply, we do not need to supplement it. Taking more of the vitamins will not cure disease, it often postpones the kind of care individuals need. Senator WILLIAMS. And there is a Supreme Court decision ofyesterday that I have not read, but I think it deals with this point310 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY of the quality of maliciousness and libel slander situation. Maybe you better tell your lawyer to read that, too. Dr. CEDERQUIST. I will be glad to do this, sir. Senator WmLOmWs. I find your statement very helpful, Doctor. Senator Neuberger? Senator NEuBERGER. I am so interested in the comments that both these witnesses in the field of nutrition have made about the American Medical Association. You were not here yesterday, were you, Doctor? Dr. CEDERQUIST. No. Senator NEUBERGER. We had the counsel, Mr. Throckmorton from their association, and maybe I was led down the primrose path. I was completely gullible in his testimony that the association for which he is the counsel definitely seeks out misleading medical state- ments quackery and that sort of thing. In his statement he said, of course, not all physicians belong to AMA, which is true, although I think in my State they can hardly practice medicine if they do not belong. It is made a virtue to belong and practically a recommendation. You will see his testimony yesterday, which will be in the record that they were forthright in going after these people. Of course I wanted to question it then because I had experience with the AMA when I first started my work on the relationship between smoking and disease, and I asked why the counsel of the AMA had not done something. Dr. CEDERQUIST. I was interested in Mr. Ladimer's reference to the book, \"How to Live to be a Hundred,\" and the statement that the book was written by an M.D., member of the Illinois Medical Asso- ciation, formerly medical director for the Continental Casualty Co., author of the revolutionary book \"How to be a Hundred,\" with a foreword by Dr. Edward R. Annis, president of the American Medical Association. I believe Mr. Ladimer testified the foreword has been changed. I sent the advertisement on this book to Dr. Stare asking for an ex- planation, and I got none, frankly. Senator Wm~iAms. This is not, the onlv timp. that Tr Anniq has been wrong. [Laughter.] Dr. CEDERQUIST. Well, it is very discouraging, because as a nutri- tionist, if you stand up against the opinion of a doctor you lose the case in the eyes of the general public, in our hierarchy they stand above us. I would like to refer to one other thing that I think answers in part Senator Neuberger's question and just supports what you have to say. When the first metered diet came out, and I think you know what I mean by a metered diet, these were costing $1.57 a day for 1 day's supply. I went to the drugstore and copied the list of ingredients or the nutrients, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins found in this product. I went back to my office and with a pencil and paper tried to calcu- late how I could come up with something that had the same nutrient value. I came up with a mixture of food costing 23 or 27 cents with exactly the same nutrient values as the metered diet. I included these facts in a speech on \"Food Facts and Fallacies.\" I thought it was a bit of a joke we were paying $1.57 for something you could buy onHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 311 the open market equal in value for 23 or 27 cents. It was not longbefore I was visited by the manufacturers of the metered diet and the reason the representative came, he said, \"I have been in a physician's office in this community today, and his patients are objecting because'that woman' from the college says that you (the M.D.) are prescrib-ing something for me that costs me $1.57 and she says it is worth 23 or 25 cents.\" I thought this was a good question. I said, \"What did the doctoranswer?\" I got no reply. We had a long, heated discussion aboutthis, and finally I said to the man, \"What have I said that is not thetruth?\" He said, \"Absolutely nothing.\" My answer to him was,\"You can be real sure I am going to continue to say it.\" But I couldnever mention, in my position, the name of the product. Not here.Senator NEUBERGER. Could you send me a copy of your speech \"FoodFacts and Fallacies?\" I would love to have it.Another question I would like to ask you is about hormones. Isthere such a thing as a live hormone? Could you call a hormone live?The reason I am asking you is that from mv bills from various de-partment stores I find a little folder urging me to pay $7.50 for abouta quarter of an ounce of some jelly that will rejuvenate and take out the wrinkles and it says it has live hormones in it. Dr. CEDERQUIST. Would you consider insulin a live hormone? Senator NEUBERGER. No. Dr. CEDERQtST. Well, other hormones are in the same category. Senator NEuBERGER. It has never been alive, in other words? Dr. CEDERQuiST. No, it is produced by a living cell. This is thekind of pitch, if it is natural or if it is alive, that is used to sell many products. There is an enzyme being sold from the papaya tree andthe pitch for this is that the enzyme is almost human because it takesthe fruit 9 months to mature just as it takes a baby. [Laughter.] And this makes it extra special. This is the pitch. I have a copyof this advertisement if you would like to read it. Senator WILLIAMS. Could we see that? Are you going to stay, Doctor? Dr. CEDERQUIST. Yes, I will be here for a while. Senator WUIiu4ms. Have you folks estimated how much money iswasted in the country annually on the nutritional fads? Dr. CEDERQUIST. Well, we have no way of doing this. I refer hereto a New York Times publication for January 24, 1964, with respectto the Regimen tablets and it says here, that more than four million boxes of the pills have been sold in the last 6 years for a total of $10million. This is one product and $10 million. This little magazine lists 150 products just from one company. I think it is impossible toestimate the cost of fraud. Senator WILLIAMS. Well, it is high in the millions of dollars then? Dr. CEDERQUIEST. It must be in the millions of dollars. Senator WILLIAMS. You will be happy to have some word on an official Senate document of the 74th Congress, 2d session: \"ModernMiracle Men,\" which has been released by the Senate ever since, I guess,al the way back to the 74th Congress. That is 20 years, is it not? Dr. CEDERQUIST. Yes, sir. Senator WUILIAMs. The supply is running low, and I do not thinkthey are going to republish. This is the article on minerals, and so312 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY forth, and you find that there is a lot of bunkum in there, I believe, is that right? Dr. CEDERQUIST. Yes, sir, I have been working 4 years to get this out of circulation. Senator WILLIAMS. How many copies do they have left? Mr. ORIOL. About three. Senator WILLIAMS. Why don't you put in a request for three copies and it -will be all over. Dr. CEDERQIST. I agree with Dr. Stare. It takes so long to deal effectively with these fraudulent materials, books and so forth, the harm is done, the money is made by the time the case is settled. Senator 'WILLIAMS. Were you here when the Senate document came out? Mr. NYE. I am afraid I was. Senator WILLIAMS. It went through without your objection. The Senator and I will excuse you of that oversight. Senator NEUBERGER. I hope you have a tenure at the university. Dr. CEDERQUIST. I must confess to you I asked Mr. Carr about com- ing. He said you not only have permission. It is your moral re- sponsibility. Senator NEUBERGER. Good. Do you belong to the American Associa- tion of UJniversity Professors? Dr. CEDERQUIST. Not now. There are too many organizations to belong to and I am one of the people who believes that if you belong to something you work for it and if you are not going to work you don't belong. Senator WILLLAIS. You -will be interested to know that Dr. Stare asked me hopefully whether he had an immunity testifying here be- fore us. [Laughter.] Dr. CEDERQUIST. May I ask the same question? Senator WILLIAMS. The same protection that we give ourselves as members goes to the witnesses. Thank you very much, Doctor. (Further statements supplied by Dr. Cederquist follow:) STATEMENT OF DR. DENA C. CEDERQUTIST, CHATIMAN, DEPARTMENT OF FOODS AND NUTRITION, COLT LGE OF HOME ECONOMICS, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, EAST LANSING, MICH. In accepting your invitation to testify before this committee, I am appearing in the dual role of a private citizen and an educator. My interest in nutrition frauds and misrepresentations stems from responses received, both verbal and written, from talks and television appearances which indicate a great number of persons are confused and misinformed with respect to the adequacy of the food supply in this country. For the one person who is speaking the truth in this area of nutritional adequacy there are hundreds who are at work raising doubts and fears in the minds of the average citizen. Our senior citizens represent an ever increasing number of individuals who seem to be most vulnerable to the \"pitch\" of the food faddist. Let's take a lookat this group of individuals. In April 1960 there were 16.6 million people in the United States 65 years or older. This was an Increase of 35 percent over the number in this age group in 1950. According to the projections of the Bureau of Census the population 65 years and over may number around 20 million in 1970.1 This represents a fair number of consumers. 1 \"Recent Changes in the Aged Population in the United States,\" Bowles, G. K.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 313 Many of these elderly persons are or will be on limited incomes derived fromretirement pensions, social security, or old age pensions. The cost of foodand shelter must be met by each of these persons. How much money shouldbe set aside to purchase an adequate diet? The Home Economics ResearchReport No. 20, \"Family Food Plan and Food Costs,\" U.S. Department of Agricul-ture, presents information on the quantities of foods which should be purchasedeach week to meet the food needs of persons ages 1-75 years or over.' Selecteddata from this report are presented at three levels of spending--low-cost, mod-erate-cost, and a liberal plan. The approximate cost of 1 week's food supplyper person for October 1963 was reported as follows: Low-cost Moderate- LiberalSex-age group plan cost plan plan(dollars) (dollars) (dollars) Women 35 to 54 years -S. 40 7.40 & 50Women 55 to 74 years -. 10 7.00 7. 90Women 75 years and over- 4.90 6.50 7.50Men 35 to 54 years -6.70 9.20 o' 30Men 55 to 74 years -6.40 8.70 9.70len 75 years and over- 6. 20 8.30 9.30 Thus, a man and woman in the age bracket 55 to 74 years would needapproximately $11.50 per week or $598 per year to buy the food necessary tomeet their recommended nutrient needs (based on food prices in October 1963,low-cost plan). Less than a thousand dollars per year would purchase foodfor these two individuals at 'a liberal level of spending. A review of the eco-nomic situation of the aged3would lead me to believe that a fair number of per-sons over 65 do have the resources to purchase an adequate diet using the low-cost plan described by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It should bepointed out here that it is fairly well established that after adolescence thereare no specific nutritional requirements related to age, and there is no evidencewhich suggests older people require greater amounts of any specific nutrient thando younger adults.' A report on the diets of older persons6indicates that most of them selecteda nutritionally good diet. Where the diets failed to meet the recommendedintakes of nutrients, the faults readily could be corrected by the greater use ofsuch foods as milk, cheese, citrus fruits, breads, and cereals. Large increases inthe use of any of these foods was not indicated. And, finally, may I refer youto an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association for March18, 1961,6 and I quote: \"Only in the food faddist, the chronic alcoholic addict, and the patient with'illness resulting in hypermetabolism, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, or intestinalmalabsorption are physicians likely to find signs and symptoms of severe nutri-tional deficiency diseases. * * * These are very special circumstances and haveno bearing on the health of the great majority of U.S. citizens.\"What, then, is the problem? In my opinion we have several million personswho have reached the age of 65 or older without the benefit of a sound educa-tion in the facts related to nutrition. These persons (along with many who aremuch younger) have been led to believe the foods produced in this country areneither safe nor adequate and that special food supplements at exorbitant pricesmust be purchased if a person is to remain in good health.Following are a few representative claims made by authors of books andwriters of advertising copy. These are direct quotes-all of which, in my opin-ion, are flagrant lies or gross misrepresentations: (1) The alarming fact is that food-fruits and vegetables and grains-nowbeing raised on millions of acres of land that no longer contains minerals, arestarving us-no matter how much of them we eat. (S. Doc. No. 264, U.S. Gov-ernment Printing Office.) 2Family Economics Review, December 1963. 3 \"The Economic Situation of the Aged,\" Epstein, L. the Vltner, IL W. JAMA 175,1000,1961.314 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY (2) Heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer have increased tremendously since grain was first milled and vitamin E and all of the B vitamins discarded in the milling process. (Look Younger, Live Longer, Gayelord Hauser.) (3) If you fear that your reflexes are slowing down and you are unable to make those split-second decisions behind your steering wheel, now is the best time for you to start taking thiamine tablets. Thiamine is the best builder of mental alertness and is essential in the diet of an alert, careful, automobile driver. (\"Eat Your Troubles Away,\" p. 78. Dr. Lelord Kordel.) (4) The 15 or more B vitamins are so meagerly supplied in our American diet that almost every person lacks them. (\"Let's Eat Right To Keep Fit,\" p. 60. Adelle Davis.) From advertisements of specific products: (5) Even if you eat lots of protein foods, you may be deficient in several amino acids with resulting fatigue and depression, vague aches and pains.

Why take chances with your health? Try vitamins. May I repeat, in my opinion, every one of the above quotes is a flagrant lie or a gross misrepresentation. Yet this is the kind of misinformation with which the vulnerable senior citizen is persistently bombarded. This persistent and ap- parently effective campaign swindles millions of Americans out of millions of dollars per year. Money which could and should be used for medical care, better housing, or just \"for fun\" is spent for unnecessary nutritional supplements. My concern? (1) Persons with limited incomes are made to feel it is not possible to obtain an adequate diet from simple, inexpensive foods. This leads to the purchase of expensive, unnecessary, and in many instances, useless products. (Quote: Ex- cept in a small percentage of persons in the lowest income group where funds are insufficient to procure an adequate diet, a mixed vitamin capsule has no utility. other iha.n placebo effect, nor can such a capsule substitute effectively for a nutritious diet!) (2) Elderly persons are often led to believe the afflictions of old age are dietary in origin and thus indulge in self-medication with dietary nostrums rather than seek early medical diagnosis and care. The delay may prove costly in terms of time, money, and life. (3) There seems to be no control over the publication and distribution of false claims with respect to nutrition information(?). Any person who eats can without fear of censorship call himself a nutritionist, a dietition, or even a \"doc- tor.\" In the words of Adelle Davis, \"Without any specialized training, any organization, or any particular leadership, without 1 cent of tax money or with- out even any work but just a lot of fun, we can collectively solve this problem of America's malnutrition.\" (P. 273, \"Let's Eat Right To Keep Fit.\") It is obvious that the \"we\" referred to in the quote have no training but are willing to admit nothing stands in the way of their fraudulent activities. (4) And, finally, when is some sort of protection going to be afforded the person who Is capable, willing, and honestly attempting to both educate and protect the citizens of these United States. The purveyors of misinformation have accumulated a vast monetary resource from the lucrative businesses in which they are engaged. With this resource they can secure the best legal talent to prosecute anyone who, in their opinion, inter- \"Vitamins, Minerals, and Anemia,\" Viltner, R. W. JAMA 175, 1,000, 1961.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 315 feres with their profitable business. No such resource is available to the college professor or any other teacher. This means these latter individuals must be given some assurance of protection or they will retreat and by default the field will be cleared for the faddist. SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT BY DENA C. CEDEsQUIsT In the statement which you have in your hands, attention was directed to several important facts: (1) There is an adequate supply of food available in this country. (2) Adequate diets can be purchased within the financial means of a fair number of citizens. (3) Many senior citizens have been made to feel insecure and are worried unnecessarily about their diets. With time on their hands to sit and think about themselves and how they feel, they have been led to spending considerable money for unnecessary food supplements. Examples of costs: (1) We obtained the manufacturer's analysis of a protein supplement which cost 19 cents per day if taken in the prescribed dose. The nutritional value of these pills was about the same as that found in \u00bd/2-cent worth of skimmed, dried milk. (2) A certain food supplement costs $5.50 per month per person or approxi- mately $2.75 per week for two elderly persons. This amount of money added to the low-cost diet of $11.50 per week represents an increase of 24 percent in food supplements? For example, require scientific proof that a given product (particularly vitamins A and D) would be available in amounts at least six times the recommended intake. Evidence is accumulating which indicates high intakes of these nutrients is toxic. (3) Vitamin E is widely distributed in ordinary food. We have never been able to find a documented case of E deficiency in man. Yet many vitamin E supplements are offered for sale. For example: One hundred tablets, $2.95. Recommended intake by manufacturer: Four tablets per day or $0.118 per day. Some suggestions for actions: (1) Is there any means available whereby the U.S. mail service could control or limit the distribution of false and misleading advertising with respect to food supplements? For example, require scientific proof that a given product is effective before the product could be advertised via the U.S. mail. (For ex- ample, thiamine and safe driving.) (2) Give greater support to the FDA in its activities. More severe penalties would seem to be in order. (3) Could the legal counsel of the FDA be made available on a friend-of-the- court basis to assist individuals who are in no financial position to defend them- selves? For example, in my teaching and working with lay groups, I would like to be able to identify a product by name and make a critical evaluation of this product. If the manufacturer disagreed with my evaluation, he could take his case to court. If I could appeal to the FDA and they in turn would assume responsibility for the trail, in my opinion, fewer of these cases would ever come into court. STATEMENT FROM THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION The American Dietetic Association is an educational, scientific organization of about 17,000 professionally qualified dietitians and nutritionists. Approximately 65 percent of the members are engaged in the practice of hospital dietetics and 6 percent as nutritionists. In the role of hospital dietitian and as nutritionist, 71 percent of the membership have opportunity to give services to the aged in a professional capacity. The entire membership of the association as mem- bers of a community are in a position to share in individual and group contacts information concerning foods and nutrition. Members of the national association are also members of the 52 affiliated State dietetic associations. Within the States there are approximately 145 district dietetic associations. Well aware of the great hazards which food misinformation may have on the health of all individuals and the increasing activity in advertising directed to the aged and aging, imiembers as individuals and as members of the American Dietetic Association are participating in the following ways to help improve nutrition education of all ages including the aged.316 FEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY (1) Counseling and teaching individual senior citizens, in their homes and Ininstitutions, of the importance and need of eating good food. Interpreting thera- peutic diets as prescribed by the physician. (2) Teaching groups of the aged about nutrition. Senior citizen centers, community centers, Golden Age groups and special meetings afford these oppor- tunities. (3) Evaluating the nutritional adequacy of food served in homes for the aged. (4) Cooperating with the Library of Congress in suggesting books and refer- ences in foods and nutrition which would be valuable to the blind if available in braille or as a talking book. (5) Encouraging preparation of information to combat food misinformationfor distribution through newspapers, television, radio, and other mass media. (6) Cooperating with medical and dental societies and State home economics associations in activities associated with combating food misinformation. (7) Encouraging the use of such visual aids as the television series \"Food for Life\" and the \"Medicine Man.\" (8) Preparing bibliographies for use in public libraries of books which con-tain scientifically correct information concerning foods and nutrition. (9) Development and distribution of a booklet designed to combat food misin- formation titled \"Food Facts Talk Back.\" The American Dietetic Association and its members are extremely interested and concerned with the nutrition problems faced by the aging population. In a small way we may be able to alert the elderly citizen to incorrect beliefs andpractices related to food. We can make a greater impact through our personal as well as group contacts with older persons. Teaching and encouraging im- proved nutrition practices is a positive way to combat food misinformation. The association's role in assisting with the problems of the aged and aging weresummarized for the Subcommittee on Problems of the Aged and Aging. A copy is enclosed. [Reprinted from the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, July 1956]. COMBATING FOOD MIsINFORMATIoN AND QUACKERY 1 (By Ruth L. Huenemann, D. Sc., associate professor of nutrition, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley) At the 38th annual meeting of the American Dietetic Association in St. Louis, the house of delegates adopted, at the request of the California Dietetic Asso- ciation, a resolution concerning the need for combating food and nutrition misin- formation. This resolution reads as follows: \"Whereas members of the California Dietetic Association as individuals and groups have expressed a need for guidance in ways to conduct a constructive program to combat food and nutrition misinformation; and \"Whereas members of the California Dietetic Association feel that the asso- ciation should assume leadership in acquainting the public with sound nutritioninformation and with resources for obtaining it: Therefore, be it \"Resolved, That the American Dietetic Association should establish policies and procedures for guidance of State associations and of individual members so that they may develop similar constructive programs in their own areas; andbe it further \"Resolved, That the American Dietetic Association should conduct a program to acquaint allied organizations and the public with sound food and nutritioninformation.\" Thus, it is apparent that a pressing need is felt for an aggressive program to combat food misinformation and quackery in the field of nutrition. This paper will, therefore, be concerned with possible methods which might be employed tothis end. It will deal primarily with three aspects of the problem as I see it:(a) Principles we may want to keep in mind in dealing with the food misin- formation problem. (b) Action that is being taken by our national and State dietetic associa- tions. (e) Other activities of which I have heard or thought might be feasible or necessary. I Presented before the Sacramento region of the California Home Economics & DieteticAssociations on Mar. 13, 1956.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 317 DEFINITIONS In order that we might understand the problem, perhaps we should define a few terms. \"Food mi8information.\"-That which is not in line with scientific evidence to date. This may take the form of outright fallacies, fancies, or fads, which are often exaggerated half-truths and as such may be more difficult to combat than outright fallacies. Sometimes misinformation appears in the form of folklore; sometimes it is propounded by quacks.\"Quack.\"-A person pretending to a knowledge which he does not possess (in medicine, nutrition, or foods). Motivation of the quack usually is financial gain. He exists because food faddists exist. \"Food faddist.\"-One who follows certain food customs for a time with exag- gerated zeal, such as enthusiasts for yogurt, molasses, and so on. (You will note at once that the faddists are by no means all in one camp. Perhaps we have all, on one occasion or another, been guilty of \"exaggerated zeal\" in regard to a particular nutrient or a particular food. For instance, when I was doing ascorbic acid research, I think it possible that I may have overemphasized its importance in my teaching. I wonder if during the war most of us didn't become rather unduly zealous about enriched bread. I point this out only to remind ourselves that the objective viewpoint to which we are all committed is sometimes extremely difficult to maintain.) \"Food fads.\"-There are many types of fads. Most popular, perhaps, are the following four types: (a) Those involving exaggeration of the virtue of a particular food or diet; e.g., fruits cure cancer. (b) Those advocating omission of certain foods because of harmful properties ascribed to them; e.g., white bread is poisonous. (c) Fads emphasizing \"natural\" foods, such as foods grown on soil treated with organic rather than chemical fertilizer or unprocessed foods. Such fads obviously exclude from the diet a large portion of our food supply and raise doubts in the minds of Americans about the integrity and purity of the Nation's food supplies. Such doubts create a market for the quack's special products that sell for much more. (d) Fads involving special devices; e.g., reducing diets. You will note that all four types emphasize the food concept in contrast to the scientific nutrient concept, whereby nutrients, and not specific foods, performcertain physiologic functions. Science has shown us that individual foods are important primarily for their nutrient content. Since nutrients are widely dis- tributed, it is possible to meet the body's nutrient needs by any of numerous combinations of foods. We even go so far as to say that there is no such thing as an \"essential food\"-there are only essential nutrients. This is obviously a more complex concept than one that permits you to eat celery for your liver, carrots for your eyes, and so on. We must be good teachers, to make this understandable. WHAT IS SCIENTIFIC NUTRITION? The above is one example of a difference between a false and a scientifically sound concept in nutrition. Fundamentally, what distinguishes fact from pos- sible fallacy in nutrition? What is science, in contrast to folklore, fancy, or fad? Science is organized, tested knowledge. How is such knowledge achieved? Through four basic steps, known as the scientific or problem-solving method. They are: (a) Defining or analyzing the problem, e.g., \"What causes scurvy?\" To getat this problem, one would need to define exactly what is meant by scurvy as distinct from other diseases-its onset, symptoms, duration, and so on. The nextstep is: (b) Gathering data and formulating hypotheses. One would gather, if possible, all information already available about the disease: where does it occur, among what people, under what circumstances? What factors appear to be common to all these cases and in all these situations? On the basis of these, one would formulate some hypotheses. Our third step would then be: (C) Testing the hypotheses under controlled conditions, that is, situations so controlled that we are testing only one variable at a time. Usually, in biologic research, this means the use of more than one subject. In fact, it usually means that a large number of subjects are needed to rule out other possible variables318 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY than that which we are testing. We have a right to be extremely suspicious ofevidence based on one or two cases. Finally, the fourth step is: (d) Applying the solution to a large number of cases. If it works, fine; ifnot, we start all over again. By this process, that is, by the experimental method, scientific facts are estab-lished. Note that I did not say that scientific, i.e., organized. tested knowledge,fact is the only truth in the world, or that it is always complete truth. Folklorehas in many instances been shown to be in line with scientific fact, e.g., Egyptians found that liver cured night blindness. In other instances, e.g., eating of heartfor courage, folklore could not be substantiated as scientific fact. Thus our fight is not necessarily always betwen truth and falsehood, but between what has andhas not been established as scientific fact. As scientists, we must often say, \"There is no evidence that such and such is so,\" but not, \"That is not true.\" Toomany times we have had to eat our dogmatic statements; you all know the spinachstory. Our rebuttal to the quack, therefore, is the same question we must continue toask ourselves, \"What is your evidence?\" WHAT HARM DOES FOOD MISINFORMATION DO? Now that we have defined what we mean by scientific truth as compared to folk-lore, fads, fancies, or outright fallacies, we might well ask, \"Does it matter, and if so, how much does it matter whether people listen to food quacks or believefalsehoods ?\" We all know of instances in which people have been deprived of sound medical help by listening to the advice of some quack-cancer victims who thought they were being cured by a fad diet and who finally arrived at a doctor's office when it was too late; persons with diabetes who starved needlessly without the help ofinsulin, to mention but a few. We know also of people who have become badcases of malnutrition by following one-sided, unbalanced diets to cure some realor fancied illness. Then there are those who follow diets that may nutritionally sound but areunnecessarily expensive since they include only water-ground grains, unsulfureddried fruit, fertile eggs, raw milk, and so on. In addition to upsetting the house- hold economy, such diets breed needless and harmful distrust of our foodindustries. Finally, all victims of unsound teaching are not being prepared to accept the newer findings of science as such become available. A scientific teacher ofnutrition would hopefully teach an appreciation of the scientific method and thusprepare her pupils for newer knowledge. WHY DO QUACKS EXIST AND EVEN THRIVE? Quacks would not thrive if they met no need. What needs do they meet? (u) A need or at least a desire for information. The public has been alertedto nutrition, both by quacks and scientists, and they want to hear about it. (b) They may meet a psychologic need for those who need a crutch to lean onfor help with their organic or psychic ailments (sometimes called real versusimaginary ills. I dislike this terminology, however, for nonphysical ailments can be very real). I think we want to be aware of this fact in our dealing with food faddists, lest we go about breaking crutches without offering any alternatesupport. ACTIVITIES TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION Keeping in mind what we have mentioned so far about what we mean by scientific nutrition versus the various kinds of food misinformation and thereasons for their persistence, let us go on to discuss activities to combat mis-information. ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL AND STATE ASSOCIATIONS AND AGENCIES The American Dietetic Association and our State association have, in truescientific fashion, approached the problem by first of all attempting to analyze it. An American Dietetic Association committee has compiled fallacies and writ-ten up the facts opposing these listed fallacies. This committee report will beavailable shortly from the American Dietic Association.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 319 Our State committee on food information, with Dr. Jessie Obert of Los Angeles County Health Department as chairman, is trying to gather informa- tion about the nature and the extent of the problem here in California. She is eager to receive pamphlets or other printed matter with unsound information that is being disseminated and also announcements and accounts of activities of food quacks. All such material was used for an exhibit at our spring State dietic meeting to alert all members to the nature and extent of the problem. In my opinion it would be highly desirable to augment this beginning of an analysis of the problem with further study on who believes the quacks and why. We might learn things, techniquewise, that would be useful to us in trying to meet people's needs. Another step taken by the California Dietetic Association was to pass a resolu- tion that regional associations establish speakers' bureaus. A committee to formulate policies regarding this will be appointed by Maxine Merrick, our State president. Meanwhile, she is asking us to report to her what we have done in our regions about appointing such bureaus, and also what we want to establish by way of policies. Another group that is encouraging action is our State interagency nutrition committee. A subcommittee has been appointed to see what we can do about stimulating formation of local nutrition committees. Such committees might serve as resource and coordinating bodies for action in regard to furthering the dissemination of sound nutrition information. Several such committees have been formed-one in Los Angeles, which has even prepared a little leaflet. They aim toward having an executive secretary, I understand, with an office and telephone listing that would be a help to people who want either nutrition speakers or information. Santa Barbara also has a group, I believe, that is cooperating with the medical society. APPROACHES IN PROGRAM PLANNING Po8itive approach.-You will note that these activities aim to put the emphasis on a positive program toward disseminating sound nutrition information. This, I think, must be our approach. As I have previously implied, part of the reason for quackery and faddism is that we have left room for them to develop by not reaching the public with sound information. Sometimes this has been a matter of omission, and sometimes an error in commission, in that we have not reached the public effectively by the methods used. In regard to omissions, it is true that we are all busy people and can't go about giving lectures continuously as if we were making our living by doing so. How- ever, we might sometimes be more alert to the educational import of the work we are doing. Is every meal we serve in our hospitals a practical lesson in nutrition? Do our employees as well as our patients appreciate this fact? Do they know why the menus are planned as they are? As home economics teachers, do we and our students set a good example for the rest of the school In our eating prac- tices? These are little things that might make a difference. Perhaps sometimes omissions are due to our underestimating the public's interest and ability to understand. We teach the simple facts about nutrient content of foods and the adequate diet (which are important and must be taught), but we say nothing about more involved matters, such as the cholesterol story, and thus leave a fine opening for quackery. Let's be a little more concerned about taking the public with us each step of the way as progress is made in the science of nutri- tion, even though these recent findings cannot be immediately translated into practical dietetics. On the matter of reaching the public effectively, a great deal could and has been said. The field of communications is broad indeed and I think we would all admit that we could use help in this area. May I point out that in most com- munities there are resource people available to us-health educators with health departments, high school and college teachers in this field. You may be interested to know that a group in Los Angeles as part of the dietetic association's self- improvement plan has joined the Toastmistress Club to improve their speaking ability. Another activity suggested is seeing that the library has good nutrition books. In that connection, may I mention one that is unique-Gerard's \"Food for Life.\"'' Preventive approach.-In large part a positive approach to the food misin- formation problem is also preventive in nature. Once fad ideas are firmly en- trenched and people are emotionally involved with their food practices, it is320 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY pretty late to effect a change. The time to reach people. as I have previously im-plied, is before the quack does. Ideally, nutrition education should begin inchildhood. That is the best time to form correct eating practices. It is alsothe best time to begin to teach an appreciation of the scientific method. Thiscan be done early in grade school. Certainly in our high school home economicsclasses we can teach students by the problem-solving method and can teachthem how to evaluate evidence. Unfortunately, many students even finish col-lege without knowJng how to read a scientific article. If we cannot weigh evi-dence, how can we tell scientific fact from falsehood?Dealing directly with quacks and faaddists.-Does our emphasis on the positive,preventive approach preclude all attempts to deal directly with quacks andfaddists? No, not necessarily. I do not believe, however, that our major ener-gies should go into this area. In cases of malpractice the quack can be legallyapprehended. We have also, as I have mentioned, the right to ask him the samequestion we ask of ourselves and of each other, \"What is your evidence?\" Let usremember in dealing with him to do so on an intellectual basis and to beware ofanger. Blind, unreasoning anger can cause one to make extravagant state-ments, and so become guilty of the same fault of which one Is accusing thequack. When it comes to changing the faddist, it would seem to me one would employthe same methods we use in attempting to change anyone's attitudes or practices.Since most of us resist change, this is never easy-and in some cases, virtuallyimpossible. I feel that we should use a sympathetic, rather than a hammer-and-tongs approach, much as we deal with people of a culture different from ourown. This means beginning where people are, trying to understand why theyact as they do, commending what is right about their present practices, and thenhelping them decide to make needed changes. I would commend for all of usa reading of an article by Dr. George Foster in California's Health, \"Working withPeople of Different Cultural Backgrounds.\"2 SUMMARY I have tried to define what we mean by scientific nutrition as compared withquackery and misinformation, point out that to a degree at least, faddism andquackery exist because scientific nutritionists have not always taken the lead inteaching the public, and that a positive, preventive approach is perhaps the mosteffective. I have mentioned activities that are being carried on by our variousassociations and by groups in different communities. I have not said whatshould be done by the specific home economics and dietetic groups, for only youcan decide that. Senator WILLIAMS. Now, Dr. Allen Doner, of Northwestern Uni-versity, comes to us representing the American Dental Association.Wo appreiiat;e your- uuniil in from Iiiinois, Doctor. We, of course,know your representation. It is an honor to have you with us thismorning. Forgive us that we are a little off the schedule that we sug-gested to you. EDITOR'S NOTE5-Presentation of this paper was followed by small-group discussionsof ways in which the desire to combat quackery and food misinformation might be Imple-mented. Dr. Huenemann reports the following as some of the suggestions which evolvedfrom these buzz groups:(a) Contacting PTA groups to learn whether a meeting on nutrition might be includedIn their schedule of programs. Ib) Working with local newspapers on nutrition fillers and articles.c) Working with local radio and television stations on nutrition programs.d) Having a library committee appointed to help the local librarian in the selectionof nutrition materials(e) Organizing a refresher course in nutrition for homemakers with previous nutritiontraing, so that they might be prepared to teach community groups about recent devel-opments In nutrition. (f) Working with TOPS (take off pounds sensibly) and other civic groups on programplanning to Include nutrition content. (D) Including a nutrition booth from the county at the State fair exhibit.(h) Preparing lists of visual aids in nutrition to be used by Interested communitygroups REFERENCES 'Gerard, R.

ALLEN DONER, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, AMERICAN DENTAL SOCIETY; ACCOMPANIED BY HAL M. CHRIS- TENSEN, WASHINGTON COUNSEL, AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCI- ATION Dr. DONER. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I am Dr. Allen Doner, of Chicago, and assistant professor of diagnosis at Northwestern University. I am here as consultant to the American Dental Association. The man on my right is Mr. Hal Christensen, our Washington representative for the ADA. The American Dental Association with its some 100,000 members exists primarily for the professional betterment of the men in the pro- fession and for the benefit of the public, of course. The men in our society are graduate doctors from accredited uni- versities, all of whom have appropriate degrees to practice dentistry. They have all taken the State board examinations, passed them and are licensed to practice in their respective States which, as you re- call, is necessary by law in all of our 50 States in the Union. As a general rule, the ADA has very little problem with the pro- fessional men in the organization. Our problem with respect to quack- ery comes from the outside. It usually comes in the form of quack procedures from dental labora- tories. These are laboratories that strike out on their own, decide to handle dental cases directly with the public and bypass the den- tist. Now, dentistry by its very nature, like orthopedic surgery, does involve many purely mechanical phases. Most of us in practice either employ laboratory technicians, dental technicians, or send work out to ethical dental laboratories for the purely mechanical phases of the work. All of this work, however, is done under professional super- vision. Occasionally, however, we are plagued by quack dental laboratories contacting, as I said before, the public directly and bypassing the doctor. Most of our laboratories, fortunately, in the country are fine, hon- est, ethical laboratories working in cooperation with the doctors and these quack laboratories are certainly in the definite minority but nevertheless a thorn in our sides. These individuals have very little knowledge, practically no knowl- edge, of anatomy. May I explain that Northwestern University, for example, the medical and the dental schools all take their anatomy courses together. They are all in one class. They all. dissect a hu- man cadaver from head to foot, showing the feeling of the dental profession on the need for knowledge of the entire body. These laboratory technicians know nothing about general anatomy or oral anatomy. They know little or nothing about biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, general pathology, oral pathology, general medicine, oral diagnosis. They know nothing whatsoever about. diag- nosing or reading X-rays, and yet* many of them will do not only denture work and partial work and bridge work, but some of them even go so far as to extract teeth.322 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Now, for them to proceed without professional guidance would be very similar lo a steelworker coitstrudting a bridge by bypassing the engineer and the architect. The pharmacist is, in effect, a person who compounds materials ac- cording to a prescription by a physician, and for the dental laboratory man to strike out on his own would be very similar to the pharmacist bypassing the M.D. Now, this field of quack practice by these laboratory technicians is rather broad in scope. It embraces all ages and all brackets. It is not necessarily confined to or aimed at the aged. However, their greatest bulk of work is in the full denture field and it is our senior citizens who wear the greatest number of dental plates. So, although this form of quackery is not aimed exclusively at the elderly citizens, when the ax falls, it automatically affects our senior citizens more than others. The laboratory work that is produced by these quack laboratories is invariably of a definitely inferior nature. It is done primarily for price reasons as an incentive to have people come to them. In bypassing the dentist, they will, frankly, not only extract teeth, construct partial dentures, they will do repairs, and remakes of a patient's present dentures. Senator WILLIAMS. It seems to me this is clearly the practice of dentistry. Dr. DONER. That is right. It is the practice of dentistry without a license. Senator WILLiAMS. In all States dentistry is licensed. Can these people not be prosecuted? Dr. DONER. We have been attempting to and Mr. Montague of the Post Office Department just related to you a few moments ago the case regarding the True-Grip Dental Laboratory in Chicago. I had the good fortune of testifying in that case and, incidentally, your Post Office Department did a splendid job and we are proud of them. Senator NEUBERGER. Could I just ask you a question about this? Maybe this is something you will not want to answer, but is there any sort of a reasonable price one could expect an aged person to pay for a good denture? You know that we know the prices can be astronomical for dentures. Is there any way that the association could set a reason- able price? Dr. DONER. No more than you could for an appendectomy or a legal case. It depends upon the amount of time, the amount of materials, and so forth, that go into an individual case. Senator NEIUBERGER. Now, that can't vary too much, really, honestly, can it? Dr. DoNER. Yes. It can. That can go from one very extreme to another. Let me cite you an example. Some of these quack dental laboratories will make plates as low as $30 or $35. Senator NEUBERGER. I am not talking about quacks. I am talking about reputable dentists. Dr. DoNER. This will bring out that point. Some of them will make them for very low fees. Now, let's take the Northwestern Uni- versity Dental School, for example, where we are not working for profit. In fact, we operate at a deficit. For every bit of dentistry we put out, we go in the hole.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 323 Patients are told the basic casting is, I believe, $120. They are a wee bit aghast, and yet if you were to take that into private practice and add to it a man's time and efforts, you can see that the cost is definitely driven up, this is for good quality of workmanship in con- trast to something that could be purchased at a third of that price from an unethical laboratory, or even from some ethical practitioners, depending upon the quality of the work. Senator NEUBERGER. What were Kerr-Mills or welfare pay for a really good set of dentures for a welfare patient? Dr. DONER. Usually the welfare patients, as I see it, are referred to the universities. Senator NEUBERGER. Now, what if there is not any university, say, in my own area? Dr. DoNER. I don't know. Maybe Mr. Christensen can help us with that. Mr. CHRISTENSEN. Senator, I think the closest you could come to, perhaps, to a standard, would be the fee schedule set by the Veterans' Administration. Senator NEiJUERGER. Yes. Mr. CHRISTENsEN. I cannot tell you what it is, and it varies from one geographical area to another, but as Dr. Doner said, it is a very difficult thing to set a standard. Senator NEUBERGER. The reason I ask is that, and I don't belittle the work at all of a dentist, standing on his feet all day and every bit of income he has comes from his actual work. He cannot assign very much. Do you think there can be any connection between the attraction of the quack, the unskilled denture maker and the cost of legitimate dentures? People are appalled at paying $300 for dentures, and they see an advertisement that says, \"You can get them for $30.\" Dr. DONER. That depends on the quality of work that you are deal- ing with. In my office if I am doing high quality denture work, I can assure you they cost me more than that to produce. Senator NEUBERGER. But is there not maybe psychology of financial reasons why some old people, say, \"I cannot pay-I haven't got $300\"? Or even $150. So they fall prey to this advertisement for the cheaper denture. Dr. DONER. I suppose that is true. I suppose it is the old story that if you look long enough and hard enough you will find somebody to do a cheaper job cheaper. Senator NEUBERGER. So, we have to take this into consideration when we have Government-supported matching grants for welfare, or Kerr- Mills. And we have to realize that we want these people to have well-fitting dentures and good ones, but the cost is quite high. Mr. CHRISTENSEN. I might say this, the association certainly sup- ports the inclusion of dental care in Kerr-Mills and similar programs of that nature. It should be included, particularly for the old people, because so many of them are without natural teeth. Without proper dentures they have trouble with mastication and nutrition. For these reasons, dental care certainly should be included.324 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Senator NEUBERGER. If we are going to continue to take care of thehealth needs of elderly people it ought to be expanded and made worth- while. Mr. CHRISTENSEN. It is included in the Kerr-Mills law, and some States have it. Senator NEUBERGER. As an older person an individual ought to move to a State that gives one the best plan under Kerr-Mills, because I know some States hardly do anything. Mr. CHRISTENSEN. That is right. It should be expanded. Senator WILLiAms. In that connection, is it not true that throughout the country there is almost a complete absence of any prepaid insurance program for dentistry? Mr. CHRISTENSEN. It is beginning to move, Senator, but it has not been a big factor in the past. We are making some great progress in that field, both in commercial insurance and in nonprofit dental insurance, under what we call dental service corporations. There are more than 500,000 people covered under prepayment plans now in California. Senator NEUBERGER. How many? Mr. CHRISTENSEN. 500,000, which is not a great many in comparison to the total population, but this is a recent development that is growing very rapidly. Senator NEUBERGER. How does the dental organization feel aboutthat, do they urge it? Mr. CHRISTENSEN. The one I am referring to, the Dental Service Corp., in California, is sponsored by the Dental Society in California. It is similar to a Blue Cross or Blue Shield program and it was spon- sored and is handled by the Dental Society through a Dental Service Corp. Senator WMLLIAMS. Are you familiar with the developments re- cently in New Jersey? We had a so-called blue teeth bill that was pocket vetoed by the Governor this week. Mr. CHRISTENSEN. They have been trying for a number of years in New Jersey to get enabling legislation so that they can set up aDent al Setrv-ice Corp. Senator WILLIAMS. I think it is a constitutional impediment that the Governor sees. Mr. CHRISTENSEN. We have been disappointed that they haven't been able to go ahead with that. Senator WILLIAMS. I think it is poorly labeled \"Blue Teeth.\" Mr. CHRISTENSEN. I don't know who gave it that name. Senator NEUBERGER. How about pearly teeth? Dr' DONER. Coming back to our quack dental laboratories, whether these laboratories are constructing new dentures, relining old ones. or just repairing them, seems to make little difference, in our opinion. We think that it can all be regarded as a very hazardous procedure and is definitely detrimental to the health of the public. -I believe I can demonstrate more clearly the need for professional supervision for these seemingly purely mechanical processes on the surface, so if we can go into the slide projection I think I can make my point more clearly.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 325 (Dr. Doner showed and explained a series of slides.) The slides demonstrate the dangers involved in seeking dental care from non-professional, unlicensed personnel. The following slides and comments areillustrative of Dr. Doner's presentation. 1. D-8 and D-9. The slide shows a cauliflower-like growth over the ridgewhich is a cancer of considerable size. The patient was scheduled for immediatesurgery but due to his wife's illness he refused to proceed. (Figure 12.) 2. D-5. This picture shows early cancer of the lip. At this stage, a qualifieddoctor (M.D. or D.D.S.) would diagnose the lesion and the patient would beproperly cared for (as this man was) and at this stage success is almost certain. However, if time passes without early recognition, this lesion will grow and spread. (Figure 13.) SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT oN DENTAL QUACKERY BY THE AMERICAN DENTAL AsSOCIATION There exists today a menace to dental public health which, though it effectsthe entire population, has its greatest impact on the aged.Artificial teeth or dentures can never serve a person as well as can his healthy natural teeth. Natural teeth, with proper personal and professional care, shouldlast a lifetime. However, as a result of neglect, disease or injury, many peopleneed partial or full-mouth dentures. The skills and knowledge of a dentist arerequired to provide dentures that will restore and maintain the harmony and appearance of the face as well as assure the proper alinement of the teeth. Aperson lacking natural teeth and not properly fitted with dentures will be forced to restrict his diet in a way not consonant with good, general health.In some communities, there are unqualified persons who operate contrary tolaws designed to protect the health of the public that permit only qualified, dulylicensed dentists to practice dentistry. Many of these illegal operators advertiseto the public, as do most health quacks. Others depend on word-of-mouth ad-vertising to bring customers to their door. They say there is no need to see a\"middle man,\" the dentist. They promise rapid service and a perfect fit. Manyunsuspecting people, hoping to save money, have been trapped by such false advertisements. The tragic fact is that the person is not properly cared for,suffers a needless amount of discomfort and even pain, often suffers injury to hisgums and surrounding tissues and certainly saves no money since, in the end,professional care is necessary to restore his oral health and to then fit himproperly with dentures. Only the licensed dentist is qualified by his professional training to diagnosedental conditions and determine the design of a dental prosthesis. Under thelaws in all States, only a licensed dentist (and, to a limited degree, a licenseddental hygienist) is permitted to work in a patient's mouth. The law-abidingdental laboratory technician fulfills his important role by fabricating the denturein accordance with the instructions he receives from the dentist. The elderly are a prime target of dental \"quacks\" who operate independently of the dentist and in violation of the law. A survey conducted by the AmericanDental Association reported in 1961 that 78.3 percent of our citizens past the age of 60 wear dentures or bridges. Nearly two-thirds of the over 65 age group haveeither a complete upper or lower denture. Of those in the 20 to 29 age group,only 22.4 percent wore either dentures or bridges and only 10.1 had completeupper or lower dentures. The survey reported some significant results with respect to the cost of den-tures and proved how effective the illegal operators have been in fooling thepublic. Those respondents to the survey who had obtained complete upper or complete lower dentures during the preceding 12 months were asked to indicatethe cost of the dentures. The average (mean) cost of complete upper denturesobtained from dentists was $104.21, compared to $82.50 for those obtained fromthe \"quacks.\" The averages for complete lower dentures were $100 from den-tists and $71.88 from \"quacks.\" Thus, for an illusory saving of a very fewdollars, these people were subjecting themselves to nonprofessional care and risking injury to their oral health. Participants in the survey were asked where they intended to go for dentures,if necessary, in the future. Of the persons over age 60 surveyed, 9.4 percentindicated they would go to a dental \"quack\" or that they had no answer to this question. Of the persons over age 65, 6.2 percent indicated that they had hadtheir denture repaired by a \"quack\" within the preceding 12 months. Persons I326 3HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY S _ 7'' I\" FIGURE 12.-Cancer of ridge. FIGURE 13.-Early cancer of the lip.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 327 over age 65 were asked to indicate whether or not they agreed with the statement that a person could get satisfactory \"false teeth\" directly from a dental labora- tory technician or other unlicensed persons. A startling 12.1 percent agreed with that erroneous statement. What is the annual cost of the \"quacks\" to the Nation? Since their activities are contrary both to State and Federal law, it is difficult to get precise statistics. It has been estimated, however, that over $20 million is paid to these dental \"quacks\" annually by the unsuspecting public. Part of the problem, perhaps, is a lack of full understanding of the complexity of designing a denture. Physiological, anatomical, pathological and mechanical considerations enter into the planning and designing of a denture. The first step in planning a denture is correct diagnosis. The dentist must determine, by visual and X-ray examination, the condition of the soft tissue and of the bone which must support the denture. He must examine the jaw joint and determine the various relationships that the denture should maintain. The dentist is aware of the many changes in the mouth that result from wearing dentures and from the aging process itself. Ill-fitting dentures cause severe irritation and can even give rise to oral cancer. Obviously, the dental \"quack\" has neither the educa- tion nor the inclination to understand and act upon such considerations as these. Law enforcement in this area has been difficult because of the usual necessity to supply witnesses willing to testify that their dentures were repaired or con- structed by an unlicensed person. Customers of these \"quacks\" are reluctant to admit that they were duped. There is one Federal statute on the subject. The Federal Denture Act, some- times referred to as the Traynor Act (18 U.S.C. 1821), prohibits the transporta- tion by mail of \"false teeth\" or other prosthetic dental appliances unless the den- tures were made from casts or impressions taken by a licensed dentist. Three persons have been convicted under the Federal Denture Act, two of the convic- tions taking place in 1963. In January 1964 the Post Office Department issued a fraud order forbidding the delivery of mail or the cashing of money orders for a Chicago mail-order dental laboratory which was dealing directly with the pub- lic. This was the first such order in recent times. The problem of dental \"quacks\" has two concurrent solutions: Adequate law en- forcement and public education. To educate the public of the dangers of trust- ing the \"quack\", the American Dental Association has produced a film, \"Report on Bootleg Dentistry,\" which protrays the danger and explains the complexity of designing a denture. This film is available without charge to civic, fraternal, educational, and other such groups. HOME DENTURE RELINER AND REPAIR KITS Many drugstores around the Nation sell home denture reliner and repair kits which present serious danger to the oral health of the user. These kits en- courage the user to repair, reline and adjust his own denture. The denture re- liner kits are sold with the promise that they will give the denture a better \"fit.\" If a person is having difficulty with the \"fit\" of his denture, the only prudent course of action is to consult a dentist for diagnosis of the trouble. The home denture reliner kit usually consists of impregnated paper or some suffi- ciently plastic material that can be adapted to the contour of both the denture and the gums and ridges. These products and procedures are hazardous because the patient continues to wear an ill-fitting denture that endangers his dental and general health. It is axiomatic that these products are sold on the basis of adver- tising and labeling that makes promises the product is unable to keep. The following are typical of the advertisements, appearing nationally, for these do-it-yourself kits:\"False teeth break? Good news! Now you can repair them at home in 10 minutes.\"\"Broken or loose false plates? Fix it yourself easily in a few minutes. Your plates may become broken or loose just when you need them most. With Fix-It- Kit you can repair your own broken plates. Also tightens loose fitting plates, easily. Get permanent comfort with professional material. Complete instruc- tions.

Save $5 to $10 on repairs by doing it yourself easily and inexpensively with this new exciting 'denture repair kit.' Guaranteed to fix breaks, cracks, and loose teeth. Keep 'denture repair kit' on hand for emer- gencies.\"328 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Every dentist knows that it is not uncommon to see patients whose residual ridges have been destroyed by ill-fitting dentures. Extreme resorption is fre- quently seen in the mouths of patients who have relined or otherwise altered the shape of the impression surfaces of their own dentures with the so-calledperfect fit materials described above. When a patient attempts to change the shape of the impression surface of his dentures to improve the fit, the resulting uncontrolled stresses may cause excessive pressures on the underlying tissues.Irreparable damage to the denture foundation and to the mouth may result. The public is not fully aware of the dangers presented by the use of homedenture reliner and repair kits. The American Dental Association is in the process of gathering documented cases of injuries caused by these kits for sub-mission to appropriate governmental agencies with a request for appropriate action. Dr. DONER. I sincerely hope that I have pointed out to you the dire need of these patients undergoing any and all laboratory procedures under the direction of the men in the profession. Thank you. Any questions? Senator WILLIAMS. That was a most dramatic and very informa- tive presentation, excellent. Dr. DoN-ER. I am sorry I did not have a written presentation for you. They did not tell me. I should have one and it was only 2 days ago I learned I was to be here. Senator WILLIAMS. Senator Neuberger? Senator NEUBERGER. No questions. Senator WILLIAMs. Senator Yarborough? Senator YARBOROUGH. I had an urgent call and unavoidably had to leave during. Dr. Cederquist's presentation. I wonder if I could revert to her testimony for a moment? Senator WILLIAMS. Yes. Senator YARBOROUG1. Doctor, I want to congratulate you for this very forceful, rapid, dramatic presentation. I just express the hope that every American that went to a dentist could see a person who is competent to realize, to recognize these different symptoms and diag- nose these ailments in the early stages. I express the hope that all American dentists being trained now are trained to do that. T)V Do-mew.n VPe nre oo tra our studentus to sec that they recognize them, if they don't recognize them as such, they will recog- nize the deviation from the normal. They can always refer the cases if need be. At least, they know that. Senator YARBOROUGH. In the past, has it not been the practice of dentists if they saw something abnormal of the mouth or teeth itself to refer them to a medical doctor? Dr. DONER. Usually it is to an oral surgeon or oral diagnostician and because we specialize in this particular part of the human body. Senator YARBOROUIGH. Thank you, a lot. Dr. Cederquist, just one question before we go onto the next witness. I, read your statement. This is about people buying food to get an adequate diet. I did not see anything here about people trying to buy diets through other ways, in these local foods you find in drugstores and groceries. How about those? Are those as bad as these foods to increase your diet? Dr. CEDERQUIST. Yes, sir; many of them are. We have weighed slices of bread, for example, that are called diet breads, and find they weigh half as much as regular bread slices. The slices are cut half asHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 329 thick and, therefore, they would have half as many calories. Now, we do have many foods on the market today that are sweetened with non- caloric sweeteners and these obviously are lower in calories than foods sweetened with ordinary sugar, but there is a very large area of fraud here, too, and again misleading people into believing that these foods are something special. Senator YARBOROUGH. Is there much danger of eating those foods and ending up with some of its results that are pointed out in your pager here of eating the others? Dr. CEDERQuisT. I think if they are fortified to the degree those foods referred to are fortified-these foods may be dangerous. Senator YARBOROUGH. Doctor, you did not go into the vitamin field, did you, generally ? Dr. CEDERQUIST. I just don't believe in them as a necessary supple- ment to the American diet. We have enough of the vitamins generally in our food supply and most of us do not need extra vitamins, unless there is some disease present and the vitamins are prescribed because there is interference with utilization. Senator YARBoRotuGH. I noticed in some of these foods in your paper you said that taking some were harmless and useless expense, but some are toxic. Dr. CEDERQUIST. These are the fat soluble vitamins for which there is no known route of excretion-we represent the first generation' who has had these vitamins available in highly concentrated forms. There is evidence, fat soluable vitamins A and D are toxic. We are going to have to wait a while for the final answer with respect to these nutrients. My concern is that almost any vitamin product I look at does not have in it the recommended allowance for 1 day, it has three or four times the recommended allowance. Are you going to eat anything or are you going to take a pill every fourth day, I don't'know. Of course, the Food and Drug Administration has put a ceiling on one of the vitamins, folic acid; but this is another story. There is a ceiling on this vitamin and people should not take excessive doses of folic acid. Senator YARBOROuGH. Thank you for your contribution, Doctor. I wish we had time to go into both of those phases, the vitamins, the vitamin market and also the foods for-the reducing foods. Dr. CEDERQJisT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I realize our time is about up. Senator WnhLIA3iS. Dr. R. N. Grant, director of professional edu- cation of the American Cancer Society. Miss Irene Bartlett is ac- companying Dr. Grant. -STATEMENT OF DR. R. N. GRANT) DIRECTOR, PROFESSIONAL EDU- CATION, AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY; ACCOMPANIED BY MISS IRENE BARTLETT Dr. GiRANT. Senator, it is a great privilege for me to be here and speak on the subject of cancer. I have on my left my associate, Miss Bartlett, who is probably a walking encyclopedia on worthless cancer remedies. She knows more330 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY about this subject than perhaps anybody else and is available to your committee for any details. I would say that probably in my statement I will duplicate some of the things you have heard on other diseases and I apologize for it, but there are some unique characteristics of cancer which bear some emphasis. First of all, this is a big disease. It is a disease which affects elderly people primarily. There are 45 million people in this country that will eventually get cancer. If we live long enough, when life expectancy gets beyond 100 years of age, practically everybody will probably die of cancer. It is also unique because it is a disease in which treatment has a life and death influence. Many of the other diseases and their treatments do not bear that relationship. Unfortunately only a third of cancer patients survive their treat- ment. In other words, two-thirds are not cured. Well, this makes it a very, very promising area for quacks and peo- ple who want to take advantage of this from a monetary point of view. As a matter of fact, it is also interesting for people who want to be humanitarian-everybody is interested in cancer and cancer cures. This is one of the interesting aspects of the problem of controlling worthless cancer remedies. Prominent lay people-lawmakers-all of them have a very active interest. There are great pressures on them from their employees and from their constituents. For example, many of the Members of this Congress have laws in the hopper, proposed laws in regard to unproven cancer remedies. This goes way back in our country's history. Benjamin Franklin, one of the most scientifically sophisticated statesmen of all times, said on June 18, 1732, in a letter to his sister: I know cancer of the breast is often thought of to be incurable, yet we have here in town a kind of shell made of some wood cut at a proper time by some men of great skill which has done wonders in this disease among us, being worn for some time on the breast. I am not apt to be superstitiously fond of believing such things, but the instances are so well attested as to convince the most incredulous. Now, such medical naivete still exists on the part of our leading citizens in this country and a large part of it is due to the lack of sci- entific information that is available to them, and also incidentally, to the nature of the problem itself. For example. a cancer remedy is very difficult to prove worthwhile or worthless. It takes 5 years at a minimum, so there is this lag period which has given people time to wonder and be intrigued. We have a constant inflow of letters to our section, the new and unproved section of the national offices of the American Cancer Society in which prominent citizens are actually proposing logical cures; they are purely logical. They are not scientifically or biologically sound. But from a lawyer's or businessman's point of view, they make good sense. Some of these remedies sound reasonable, like Laetrile; the theory behind it is that it releases cyanide gas in the area where the tumor is. Everybody knows cyanide will kill living tissue. Another problem, as I said, is how to prove something worthwhile, or whether it is worthless.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 331 Well, that means that among the drugs and remedies under con- sideration there is a large spectrum of some way over on one side which are obviously worthless, which even a high school science stu- dent could see the fallacy, and there are some far over on the other side which it takes a very sophisticated laboratory of the National Cancer Institute to pin down its worthlessness, as we recently have seen. Because of this, it is very important that the approach to cancer quackery be openminded, it be flexible, adjustable. In monitoring this field you must look at all the evidence, consider all proposed remedies and not condemn any of them from scratch. In fact, the very name of our committee in the American Cancer Society is based on this; it is called the Committee on New or Unproved Methods of Treatment of Cancer. It originally was calledthe quackery committee, but this implied prejudice and prejudgment before the drug had a chance for trial. There is another aspect of cancer remedies which is imique, too, I believe. Even after the proponent is long gone, he is dead and buried, the method lingers on. Now, this is illustrated in several striking instances. One was the Gerson method of treating cancer; it was prominent in the New York area in the 1930's and 1940's. It consisted of a diet treatment for cancer, special vegetable diets, including coffee enemas, and the coffee had to be brewed; it could not be instant coffee. All that sort of nonsense. He died in 1959, yet in 1960 this method was being used in California and in New Jersey in 1962. And there was a paperback book on the newsstands in 1963 entitled \"Has Dr. Max Gerson a True Cancer Cure?\" Similarly Laetrile is currently being promoted in the United States and Canada through the sale of a paperback book entitled \"Laetrile: Control for Cancer,\" and a Sunday newspaper supplement story which appeared in the American Weekly, March 3 and 10, 1963. This drug, originally obtained from apricot kernels, is reported by its proponents to be a compound made up of laevomandelonitrile- bet~a-glucuronoside---Laetrile. The name was coined from the laevo and trile parts of the chemical name. It is said to release cyanide \"in the cancer areas, without injury to other tissue.\" This drug was first used in the 1920's. It was thoroughly investi- gated by the Cancer Commission of the California Medical Associa- tion in 1953 and found to be ineffective in the treatment of cancer. Now, the drug has been \"rediscovered\" and is being promoted by the McNaughton Foundation of Montreal, a so-called nonprofit re- search foundation. It is important to emphasize the method rather than the individual because individuals tend to flourish under the spotlight of attention; also they can take retributive action, and methods cannot. They can delay the action. Also, when you concentrate on the individuals you get into the questions of motivation which are always difficult to evaluate, whereas you can approach a method scientifically. Another thing when you concentrate on an individual you get into creating a medical martyr very often. Dr. Ivy is a current medical martyr in the eyes of many people.332. 3.EALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY The American Cancer Society has a large file system of material on unproven cancer remedies in our national office and we service our 59 divisions throughout the United States with materials to aid them. We provide materials to physicians. This particular type of ex- hibit closest to you is one for physicians. We have been trying to provide information to physicians and to alert them to new problems in unproven cancer remedies. This is important because there is no other source for physicians to get this information. Medical journals will not publish articles on drugs which are obviously no good. A patient comes in and asks him about Laetrile. He cannot read about it in his ordinary sources of medicine and he feels quite frus- trated and feels he is condemning a drug which he knows nothing about when he says it is no good. We publish this information for doctors in our journal, CA a cancer journal for clinicians. This is an extensive area. We are living continually in fear of legal action by people because they may misunderstand what we said about the drug or the implications they draw may be such as to give somebody reason to feel they have cause for action. We feel it is our duty, like the University of Michigan's Dr. Ceder- quist, it is our obligation. And I might say that I have no tenure at the American Cancer Society. But we do have legal advice and support from our volunteers backing us up. All our materials are gone over very carefully for legal opinion before we release them. On the other hand, they are like physicians giving advice on an illness' All they can do is give you a fair estimate of your chances in court. They cannot guarantee you a cure or prevention. We have promoted and encouraged the passage of State legislation in various States trying to encourage them to do something in their own local community upon worthless cancer remedies One of the Cancer Society's strong convictions is that the proper way to ap- proach the cancer quack problem is to approach it in the local com- munity where the patient first comes in contact with the worthless remedy, because a life may be lost or saved at this particular point o1 Imom111eiIt. As you have heard, it takes the Federal Government, as good as it is, I may say they are extremely competent, it takes them years to get action far away in Washington. Senator YARBOROUGH. IS the Hoxsey Clinic still in operation? Dr. GRANT. I was about to say, Senator, it took the FDA-as I say, they have the finest lawyers that exist in this area, Billy Good- rich, there is none better-but he said at the first cancer quackery con- gress, that it took him 10 years of continuing legal maneuvering to get the Hoxsey remedy made illegal, and there are areas where it still pops up. They just eliminated it finally in Pennsylvania. Miss BARTLETT. The latest thing on the Hoxsey method, is that it has just been made illegal to use the Hoxsey method in the State of California. What happened was there were little nests here and there all over the country where people were using the Hoxsey method and they kept right on using it. Then the health magazines published articles in which they gave all of the Hoxsey formulas and told the people where they could get the ingredients and take them to theirHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 333 drugless \"doctors\" and get these \"doctors\" to mix them up for them. It is not dead yet but it has died down. Dr. GRANT. I would like to make a few more points because they back up some of the previous testimony. As I say, we have a very active public and professional educational program on this as well as trying to promote the legislation which has been passed now in California and similar legislation in Nevada, Colorado, Kentucky, Maryland, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. This legislation attempts to create a body having statutory standing with rights to investigate, hold hearings, and make reports of a priv- ileged nature on this type of problem. Now, there is a special problem in cancer also which is the paperback problem, you might say. The publication of this material in the form of paperbacks, has introduced a health threat to the public. Books on medical science, especially if they are on so-called controversial medi- cal problems, are quite appealing to the reading public. Taking advantage of this, a number of writers have written books on unproven cancer remedies which have been a major factor in the pro- motion and increased use of these remedies. We spoke of Laetrile and the Gerson book. These books are often exceedingly well written so that the average reader-and this is very important in cancer-the average reader comes to the conclusion that he himself can make a valid judgment of the merits of a treatment in question, and usally in favor of its use. The reader then becomes, in effect, the promoter of the treatment recommending it to his associates and friends when they have any disease or symptoms which he thinks might be alleviated by the treat- ment he has read about. In my opinion, one of the reasons why krebiozen became such a prob- lem in this country was because of the publication and promotion of three favorable and well-written books on the subject. Needless to say, there are profits from the sale of such books? com- pletely removed from the advantages gained from the promotion of the treatment itself, which can perpetuate and increase the use of an unproven remedy. Another problem in cancer quackery, is that the average citizen in this country erroneously assumes that he has tremendous protection from exploitation by proponents of worthless remedies. He doesn't believe they would let this go on if it were worthless. He has great belief in something that does not exist. On the national level, only the American Cancer Society, the Food and Drug Admin- istration, the American Medical Association, and the National Cancer Institute have any interest in the matter, and all of us are markedly limited in our capacity to be effective. Let me give an example of the type of frustration -there is in this. A newspaper reporter was investigating a story about a physician who was utilizing a lot of worthless cancer remedies. The AMA has no jurisdiction over him because he is not a member of the AMA. An AMA spokesman said, \"This is a case for the State's licensing agency.\" A spokesman for that agency explained: \"Unfortunately, these medical cases are difficult because it is impossible to get one doctor to testify against another. This is a case for the food and drug people.\" The Food and Drug Administration official said \"It is not our policy to police the medical profession. This is a painful problem and you wonder what is the proper solution for it.\"334 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY What can be done, if anything, in this frustrating area? It cer- tainly is painful and it is obvious nothing great has been done and there needs to be something done. What possibly could be done? Well, I would only report that our experience in the society has shown that the Federal Government's increasing interest in protecting its citizens from the effects of improper treatment of illness is showing beneficial results. The impact of the two medical quackery congresses in which the Federal agencies were so strongly represented has resulted in greatly aiding our efforts in controlling unproved cancer remedies. We have seen this in our office. The krebiozen situation has finally approached the end of the line because of the excellent and courageous work of the Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute. It seems to me it would be desirable to establish a special division of the Federal Gov- ernment, possibly in one of its agencies such as the Public Health Service, to deal with the entire problem of worthless remedies for ill- ness and fraudulent activities of charlatans. In the health field, such an agency could concern itself with col- lecting data and coordinating control efforts at the national level and in cooperation with the States and private health agencies. Now, this agency by taking the initiative in efforts to control this problem could make a very strong impact in diminishing the fraud- ulent practices in this country. I might say in conclusion, all of us could ask ourselves, \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" in attempting to protect the individual who submits himself to unproven cancer treatments. If he does so knowingly and willingly, any interference might seem meddlesome but, unfortunately, most cancer victims receive worthless treatments innocently through lack of information. This is the tragedy, as well as perhaps, the key to the problem. A vast educational program such as that of the American Cancer Society, which provides information on proper treatment methods and emphasizes the hopeful aspects of the disease probably will do more to minimize the influence and effect of cancer quacks or erae~tkdons on indi.iuss This is not to minimize the importance of the latter, but we must recognize the limitations of legislation in comparison to the power of education. Thank you very much and I will answer any questions you may have. (Prepared statement by Dr. Grant follows:) STATEMENT OF ROALD N. GRANT, M.D., DIRECTOR OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION, AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY WORTHLESS CANCER REMEDIES-A CHALLENGE TO SOCIETY Mistreatment or delayed proper treatment is a possibility inherent in any new or unproven method of treating cancer. Since proper and early treatment of cancer is a life-and-death matter, any deviation from this desideratum is of con- cern to those with responsibility for control of the disease. Moreover, because of the high prevalence of cancer and the fact that treatment falls short of being curative for at least two-thirds of the victims, it attracts numerous proponents of new and unproved remedies. These proponents present a spectrum of qualifi- cations for treating cancer, ranging from the ignorant, uneducated, home-remedy dispensers to the sophisticated holders of doctor's degrees in biological science or medicine.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 335 One of the special aspects of controlling worthless cancer remedies has alwaysbeen the unusual attention and support that lay persons in all walks of life, par-ticularly elected officials and statesmen, for some inexplicable reason have givento unproven cancer cures. For example, back in colonial days, even the scientifi-cally sophisticated Benjamin Franklin was a proponent of a worthless cancerremedy. On June 18, 1731, he wrote to his sister, \"I know cancer of the breast isoften thought of to be incurable, yet we have here in town a kind of shell madeof some wood, cut at a proper time by some men of great skill, which has donewonders in this disease among us, being worn for some time on the breast. I amnot apt to be superstitiously fond of believing such things, but the instances are so well attested as to convince the most incredulous.\" Such medical naivete onthe part of our leading citizens has persisted up to the present day. Such misguided enthusiasm and resulting harmful action on the part of many of our leading citizens occurs largely because of the paucity of factual information on the various proposed cancer remedies and because sometimes it is a difficultmatter for medical science to prove which method of cancer treatment is worthwhile and which is not. What may be considered not useful or promising todaymay be less obviously so several years from now. Less than a decade ago, thevirus etiology of cancer theory was looked upon with considerable skepticism bythe scientific community. Yet today this is a respected theory openly supported by many prominent physicians and scientists. In view of the foregoing, anyapproach to the control of worthless cancer remedies must be openminded aswell as hardheaded. Such an ambivalent attitude is not easily adopted or main-tained, but when special efforts are made to preserve it, an objective and moreeffective program of control is possible. The very title chosen by the American Cancer Society's Committee on New or Unproved Methods of Treatment of Canceremphasizes this point. When originally formed in 1954, it was called the\"Quackery Committee.\" However, very shortly after its first meeting the com-mittee took action to remove quackery from its title and adopted its present name.The word \"quackery\" implied prejudgment or prejudice. Also, the new titleplaces emphasis on the unproven method rather than the individual. Concen-trating attention on the unproven method rather than the individual is soundfor several reasons. First, proponents of new and unproven methods of cancer therapy eventuallyeither die or turn to other areas of interest, but unfortunately, the method lingers on. The Gerson method of treating cancer is based upon a special vegetable dietand includes coffee enemas (the coffee must be brewed-instant coffee is notacceptable). This treatment was widely used by Dr. Gerson in the 1930's and1940's in the New York area. He died in 1959, nevertheless, his treatment wasbeing used at a health resort in California in 1960 and in New Jersey in 1962,and a new paperback book entitled. \"Has Dr. Max Gerson a True Cancer CureT'was being sold on newsstands in 1963.Laetrile is currently being promoted in the United States and Canada throughthe sale of a paperback book entitled, \"Laetrile: Control for Cancer,\" and aSunday newspaper supplement story which appeared in The American Weekly,March 3 and 10, 1963. This drug, originally obtained from apricot kernels, isreported by its proponents to be a compound made up of laevo-mandelonitrile-beta-glucuronoside-Laetrile. The name was coined from the laevo and trileparts of the chemical name. It is said to release cyanide \"in the cancer areas,without injury to other tissue.\" This drug was first used in the 1920's. It wasthoroughly investigated by the Cancer Commission of the California MedicalAssociation in 1953 and found to be ineffective in the treatment of cancer. Nowthe drug has been \"rediscovered\" and is being promoted by the McNaughtonFoundation of Montreal, a so-called nonprofit research foundation which \"spe-cializes in sponsoring independent research, particularly by scientists who areunable to get backing from orthodox research organizations either because theirideas are too far off the normal thought of the day or because the individual,himself, because of his personality, is unable to get along with organizations.\"These are examples of the difficulty in eliminating worthless cancer remedies,when they are promoted by persons or groups other than the original proponent.Emphasizing the method rather than the individual is also important becauseindividuals tend to flourish under the spotlight of attention, while methods fallinto proper perspective as more becomes known about them. Moreover, individ-uals can take retributive action, thus delaying control, while methods cannot. Finally, concentrating on an individual often leads into questions of motivationwhich cannot be scientifically appraised, while methods and material can be336 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY carefully analyzed and evaluated. It seems that when control efforts on new and unproved therapy concentrates on the individual rather than the method, It frequently turns out that it furthers the individual's cause rather than cur- tails it. Public sympathy is aroused and well-meaning but misguided supporters arise to defend the individual. A medical martyr is born and like other martyrs, is worshiped and his methods supported. The American Cancer Society in its efforts to control worthless remedies has adopted the following objectives: (1) To develop more effective means of dealing with claims for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer that are advanced without acceptable evidence of value; (2) to encourage investigation through scientific or other qualified organizations of unestablished claims for cancer diagnosis and treatment; (3) to encourage the development of legislative programs both State and Federal, which will prevent the exploitation of the public in matters relating to the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, and to obtain the continued support of organized medicine in behalf of these objectives by every possible means; (4) to develop and encourage educational programs which will give to the public both information regarding specific cases and also a better understanding of the criteria for assessing the merits of new claims; (5) to encourage physicians to provide adequate care of patients with far-advanced cancer because it is, in the main, these individuals who unwittingly fall prey to cures which have no proven merit; and to encourage physicians to keep careful records of the life history of the disease in a given patient and to record objective data of extension or im- provement as the disease progresses under treatment. In carrying out these objectives, an information center has been developed for the collection and distribution of materials on new and unproved methods of cancer diagnosis and cure. This unique collection, which is one of the prin- cipal repositories for such information in this country, includes the voluminous file materials on this subject which were turned over to the American Cancer Society by the Committee on Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy of the National Research Council in 1957. There is a steadily increasing flow of information to and from the file. Information culled from it forms the basis for a monthly current events summary issued to the committee members to keep them abreast of new developments in the field. Also, the material has been classified into an \"Index' of American Cancer Society File Material on New or Unproved Methods' bf Treatment of Cancer,\" for use by the 59 divisions of the society and other interested professional groups. One of the fundamental concepts of the American Cancer Society's approach to the overall cancer problem is its emphasis upon action at the local level. In controlling new and unproved methods of cancer therapy, this tactic is es- pecially important because it is in the local community that the cancer victim and his family first come in contact with the cancer nostrums in a manner whch can be devastating, for it is at this time that most lives are either lost or saved from cancer. In working through its 59 divisions representing State- sized communities, and its over 3.000 county units, the society has fostered the formation of State cancer commissions or committees to assume responsi- bility for collecting and evaluating scientific and clinical evidence on various claims on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. State control of unproven cancer therapy has also been fostered -through the formulation of model legisla- tion to assist States' contemplating laws of this type. Such legislation to create a body having statutory standing with rights to investigate, hold hearings, and make reports of a privileged nature was first enacted in this country by the California Legislature in June 1959 and similar legislation has since been 'passed in Neveda, Colorado, Kentucky, Maryland, North Dakota, and Penn- sylvania. However, legislation, either at the local or national level, cannot alone solve the problem. Education of both the public and the medical profession is neces- sary. The American Cancer Society is very active in this area with the pub- lication of pamphlets, brochures, exhibits, etc. A special background report on unproven cancer therapy has been distributed to newspaper and magazine editors alerting them to the problem and stimulating further dissemination of information. In professional education, one of the difficulties has been the tendency of physicians to be disinterested in the subject, hoping that it will somehow go away by itself. Also, physicians have not easily been able to get information on the various unproven methods of cancer therapy because such material is n ot ordinarily published in medical journals. The American Cancer Society isHEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 337 now filling the gap by utilizing the pages of its medical journal-CA-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, distributed to physicians. An important feature of each issue of 150,000 copies, is a special statement on various new and unproved meth- ods of cancer therapy prepared from the files of the national office. Since such materials can be quite sensitive from a legal point of view, the reports are prepared with considerable care by the staff and members of the committee on new or unproved methods of treatment of cancer and after they are reviewed by the society's legal counsel, they are released to the 59 divisions for their in- formation. Those statements which have special or current significance to physi- cians are selected by the editor of CA for publication. Such publication places the material In the public domain and the reprints of the statements are then useful for distribution to the medical profession and lay persons in answering inquiries. The following is a list of reports which have so far been published in CA, the reprints of which are available. (See attached.) Publication of material on unproven cancer remedies can, however, be like a two-edged sword. For example, the current popularity of paperback books has introduced a new health threat to the public. Books on medical science, especially if they are on so-called controversial medical problems, are quite ap- pealing to the reading public. Taking advantage of this, a number of writers have published books on unproven cancer remedies which have been a major factor in the promotion and increased use of these remedies. Previous reference was made to the books entitled \"Laetrile: Control for Cancer,\" and \"Has Dr. Max Gerson a True Cancer Cure?\" This type of book is often exceedingly well written, so that the average reader comes to the conclusion that he himself can make a valid judgment on the merits of the treatment in question, usually in favor of its use. The reader then becomes in effect a promoter of the treatment, recommending it to his associates and friends when they have any disease or symptoms which he thinks might be alleviated by the treatment he has read about. In my opinion, one of the principal reasons why Krebiozen became such a problem in this country was because of the publication and promotion of three favorable and well-written books on the subject. Needless to say, there are profits from the sale of such books, completely removed from the advantages gained from the promotion of the treatment itself, which can perpetuate and increase the use of an unproven remedy. The average citizen in this country erroneously assumes that he has protec- tion from exploitation by proponents of worthless cancer remedies and pre- cisely because he has little or no such protection, the risk is compounded. On a national level, only the American Cancer Society, the Food and Drug Adminis- tration, the American Medical Association, and the National Cancer Institute have any interest in the matter, and they are markedly limited in their capacity to be effective. This is illustrated in the following frustrating experience de- scribing a newspaper reporter investigating a story about a physician who was utilizing a variety of well-known cancer remedies. \"The AMA has no jurisdiction over him because he is not a member of the AMA. An AMA spokesman said: 'this is a case for the State's licensing agency.' \"A spokesman for the agency explained: 'Unfortunately, these medical cases are difficult because it is impossible to get one doctor to testify against another. This is a case for the food and drug people.' \"The Food and Drug Administration official said: 'It is not our policy to police the medical profession. This is a painful problem and you wonder what is the proper solution for it.'\" What can be done if anything in this frustrating area? Certainly our ex- perience has shown that the Federal Government's Increasing interest in pro- tecting its citizens from the effect of improper treatment of illness is showing beneficial results. The impact of the two medical quackery congresses, in which the Federal agencies were so strongly represented, has resulted in greatly aiding our efforts in controlling unproved cancer remedies. The Krebiozen situation has finally approached the end of the line because of the excellent and courageous work of the Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institutes. It seems to me it would be desirable to establish a special division of the Federal Government, possibly in one of its agencies such as the Public Health Service, to deal with the entire problem of worthless remedies for illness and fraudulent activities of charlatans. Such an agency could concern Itself with collectingdata and coordinating control efforts at the national level and in cooperation with the States and private health agencies. By taking the initative in efforts to control this problem, such an agency could be a very strong factor in diminish-ing Its impact on the Nation.338 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY \"Am I ily brother's keeper?\" (Genesis IV: 9) is a question which we might ask ourselves in attempting to protect the individual who submits himself to unproven cancer treatments. If he does so knowingly and willingly, any interference might seem meddlesome but, unfortunately, most cancer victims receive worth- less treatments innocently through lack of information. This is the tragedy, as well as perhaps, the key to controlling the problem. A vast educational program such as that of the American Cancer Society, which provides information on proper treatment methods and emphasizes the hopeful aspects of the disease probably will do more to minimize the influence and effect of cancer quacks than specific laws or crackdowns on individuals. This is not to minimize the inipor- tance of the latter, but we must recognize the limitations of legislation in compari- son to the power of education.

Yours truly, C. HOBART VILLAR. STATE OF FLORIDA, County of Escambia, 88: My name is Mae Jean Gilbert. I am 32 years old, unmarried, am a teacher inthe Brownsville Elementary School and live at 912 East Jordan Street, Pensa-cola, Fla., with my mother, Mrs. Jennie R. Gilbert, who has been chronicallyill for the last 14 years. Her illness has been diagnosed as Parkinson's diseaseand she has been under the care of several medical doctors including Dr. Bark-ley E. Biedleman and Dr. Clyde E. Miller, of this city, and Dr. Coffler, ofMobile, Ala. These are reputable medical doctors.In October 1962 Mr. Henry W. Sanborn, real estate agent, came to my hometo discuss a matter with my maid and observed my mother in her invalid con-dition in the house. Later that same day, after I had returned from my dutiesat school, Mr. Sanborn returned and told me about a machine which he de-scribed as wonderful and related to me in detail how he had been cured froman ailment which he described as Bright's disease; that this machine was de-signed for the treatment and cure of various ailments and that he was sureit would be most beneficial to my mother. At that time, he gave me a mimeo-graph sheet listing many ailments which this machine showed a high percentageof success in treatment and cure. I was impressed, although my mother's ailmentwas not listed on the sheet. I was assured numerous times by Mr. Sanborn thathe was convinced that the machine would be well worth the investment.Also Mr. Sanborn told me that he had taken a man suffering from Parkinson'sdisease to either Salt Lake City, Utah, or Phoenix, Ariz., and that the man hadto be either carried in or assisted for his first treatment on a similar machine,the Cosray. That after several treatments, he showed remarkable improvement.At that time, I contacted Research Institute, Inc., in Salt Lake City, Utah,as to my interest in leasing one of their machines. Either by correspondenceor telephone I had contact with Mr. John E. Moray and Mr. Henry Moray. Iwas furnished with the names of two doctors as references. I called both of themand they recommended the machine. One of them, Dr. A. L. Gagnier, 333 EastMcDowal Road, Phoenix, Ariz., wrote me a letter dated December 6, 1962, a copyof which is attached. As a result of these contacts, I entered into a lease agreement. photostatic copywhich is attached, wherein I agreed to pay the sum of $3,210, $1,210 upon thesigning of the lease agreement and before delivery of the machine and $100per month for 20 months and $10 thereafter.340 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY I sent my personal check for $1,110, photostatic of canceled check attached, and Mr. Sanborn sent his check for $100 as per his agreement for the down- payment. John Moray personally delivered the machine to my house on November 24, 1962, along with instructions booklet, and showed me how to operate it. John Moray cautioned me never to let anyone open the cabinet and let anyone see the inside of it. Thereafter I used the machine, treating my mother, as in- structed, several times. It soon became apparent that my mother's condition was not improved. I discontinued the use of the machine. I later made a $100 payment on the lease agreement. Before making any more payments I consulted C. Hobart Villar, an attorney in Pensacola, Fla., who instructed me to make no more payments. Subsequently, the Florida State Board of Health representative and an investigator for the Food and Drug Ad- ministration made contact with me and in the process took from my possession the machine and all literature pertaining to it. This statement is being made for the purpose of being used by a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on Aging which I understand begins public hearings on Monday, March 9,1964, in Washington, D.C. I was unable to attend the hearing to which I was invited, but would be able to attend a hearing later should it be desired. The above statement consisting of three legal-size pages, double spaced, has been read-by me and is true and correct. MAE JEAN GILBERT. Sworn to and subscribed before me this 6th day of March 1964.

Beeuwkes,l University of Michigan School of Public Health,Ann Arbor) The history of food faddism is fascinating, and it would be entertaining, if itwere not repeating and extending itself today. Throughout the records of man'sefforts to lessen pain, cure disease, and forestall or perhaps prevent death, thecharlatans and quacks have received top billing. Despite our remarkable ad-vance in knowledge, nonsense has never interfered more effectively with theapplication of the science of nutrition in the feeding of Americans, sick andwell. Human beings are obviously incurably credulous. At the present time,the prognosis is not good. The extent of the problem and the cost to the consumer are amply documented in the records of the Food and Drug Administration, the American MedicalAssociation, the Better Business Bureau, the U.S. Post Office, and the FederalTrade Commission. It is a strange paradox that the decades which have seena rapid advancement in the science of nutrition have also seen this fantasticincrease in products, pills, and panaceas offered through misleading adver-tising and expounded by irresponsible nutrition \"lecturers\" and \"writers.\" Factors influencing food faddistm Many factors have influenced and in some way contributed to this unhappysituation, but a few examples may be cited of the details of the environmentalmosaic against which faddism continues to thrive. Our means of communication have become so effective that the limited in-fluence of yesterday's medicine man has expanded into a barrage of misinforma-tion through the channels of radio, television, newspapers, magazines, itineranthealth lecturers, and persistent door-to-door salesmen.Testifying before a congressional committee on false and misleading ad-vertising, Dr. S. William Kalb 2 stressed the significance of modern communica-tion media in the rapid spread of misinformation: \"The. oldtime medicine man, yesterday's nutrition quack, sold his cure-all,youth-restoring patent medicines to the small groups he was able to attractto a show on a street corner, in a vacant lot, or at picnics and fairs. He oper-ated in a very small way under conditions of relatively limited communicationand slow spread of public information. Improvements in communication makepossible the rapid and widespread dissemination of information. An informedpublic became conscious of the lack of effectiveness of cure-alls in the patentmedicines. Exposed, deprived of his protecting cloud of mystery and ignorance,the medicine man disappeared from the scenes some 20 years ago; or did he?\"Too good to be true, this disappearing act was in itself an illusion. Adaptinghimself to a changing time and conditions, to a better informed public, themedicine man became a food expert or a drug expert dealing in so-called healthfoods and drugs and diet supplements instead of patent medicines. Ironically, it is the food faddist who has recognized and made use of the opportunity af-forded by our modern communication methods to reach and, influence greatnumbers of people quickly and effectively.\" l Associate professor of public health nutrition, University of Michigan School of PublicHealth, Ann Arbor, Mich. 2 Kalb, S. W., \"Testimony on False and Misleading Advertising,\" hearings before asubcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations, House of Representatives,85th Cong., 1st sess., 1957, pp. 2-3. 341342 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY In the \"good old days,\" it took months for a manufacturer of patent medicines to inform only a few thousand citizens about his newest remedy. Today, a manufacturer can enlighten millions of potential customers about equally in- effective products in the seconds allotted to a commercial on the airwaves. The mysteries and magic of food make good copy because scientists are the first to acknowledge their limited but rapidly growing understanding of the specific role of certain nutrients in human nutrition. Furthermore, theories and postulates, evolved by investigators and reported for the information of their professional colleagues, are often quoted as proved and accepted facts by promoters who find an isolated statement useful in their misleading but often convincing advertising copy. Because a scientific report may become the faddists' sales instrument, investigators find it necessary to control their en- thusiasm when reporting results with products they use in clinical trials. In each scientific announcement of evidence demonstrating a need for, or the usefulness of, a particular nutrient for the well-being of a mouse or a monkey, the faddists recognize fertile soil for another story, another product, and addi- tional profit. Through ignorance, indifference, or plain dishonesty, faddists fail to realize the hazards of transferring isolated findings from experiments with animals to widespread application in human nutrition. Royal jelly may be beneficial to the queen bee, but it is certainly no panacea in the human race. Surely, scientists will not step from behind the barriers raised by conservatism, honesty, and ethics to make false claims and unrealistic promises. The faddists capitalize on the very characteristics that are the pride of professional persons. Our economy has permitted people to spend money for expensive dietary sup- plements, health foods, health lectures, and \"miracle\" cooking utensils. Perhaps some faddists would spend their last dime for such luxuries, but it is likely that faddism would not be as expensive if the economy could not bear it. Copywriters do an excellent job of aiming much of their \"come-on\" about \"new, unknown to medical science\" hokum toward older citizens whose income may be too limited to permit both supplements and good food. Newspaper advertising for \"Lipitrons,\" for example, opened with the words:\" \"If you are over 35 years old. * * * If you are getting that \"growing old\" feeling. *** Science has now found how to fight that feeling of \"growing old.\" \"Lipitrons- \"For you if you feel tired, and weak, and rundown. \"For you to help you recapture lost vitality and strength. \"For you to combat nervousness, lack of vigor and energy.\" The complete advertising copy created the impression that the drug was effec- tive in the treatment of persons over 35 years old to combat that feeling of grow- ing old; to relieve tiredness, weakness, nervousness, and a rundown condition; to overcome the deficiencies that help drag one down; for premature advancing age; to furnish a whole new world of buoyant energy, vitality, and strength by reliev- ing and overcoming the basic causes of their nutritional deficiencies; to help those who feel years older than their age to enjoy life again; to regain vigor and vibrant energy; to enable thousands of men and women to work harder, etc., ad nauseam. The U.S. District Court of Nebraska found the corporation and the defendant guilty on all counts. The court decision in this case includes a statement of the concern which we have today as advertising copy continues to bombard older people with vague promises and empty guarantees for rejuvenation at a price. \"The present drugs and their supporting publicity would have no appeal and little meaning to young persons, athletes, high school or university students, youthful workers, or business or professional people. But it is quite otherwise with men and women beyond middle age, the so-called older folk of the type pictured in the challenged newspaper advertising. As most members of the Federal judiciary will at once realize, those oldsters need little more than a vagrant suggestion to lead them to hope in the restorative ministry claimed for the defendants' tablets. Their publicity advances a message they are longing to read or hear; and with pathetic eagerness they receive and embrace it. They must especially be regarded in these circumstances, for it is to them and their faltering faculties, physical and mental, that the message of the labeling is orient- ed. Thus understood, the court has no difficulty in concluding that the labels 8 United States of America v. Vitamin Induatries, Inc. et al., 130 F. Supp. 755 at 760. 1955.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 343 and labeling are false and misleading. What, indeed, can be more cruelly falseand misleading than the inspiration of hope in one for whom actually there isno hope?' The book \"Arthritis and Common Sense\" 5has had such wide appeal in its ownmisleading way that the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American MedicalAssociation devoted an editorial to the topic, \"who Treats Arthritis?\"' andurged physicians to peruse this book. The council declared: \"There are thoseindividuals who do not ask their physician's advice. They may very possibly bein the majority, indicating an even more important reason for the physician tobe aware of this type of literature. Is it not one of his responsibilities to hiscommunity and to his profession to exert all of the influence he can in combatingfood and health misinformation whenever and wherever it may occur?\"The fact that \"Folk Medicine-A Vermont Doctor's Guide to Good Health\"'was written by a member of the American Medical Association (licensed to prac-tice medicine in 1904) has provided it with much prestige. The sales figures forthis book give evidence of a desire of thousands of our citizens to consider andperhaps accept the author's new theory (honey and apple cider vinegar) on thetreatment and prevention of diseases ranging from the common cold to arthritisand \"many others which often defy conventional medical diagnosis and treat-ment.\" The aged country doctor has added to the confused state of affairs inthe field of weight reduction by suggesting that \"the apple cider vinegar willhave made it possible to burn the fat in the body instead of storing it * * *\"Some people obviously enjoy being \"on a diet\" and championing a \"cause.\"They are certain to become the center of conversation when they launch out todefend their latest dietary excursion. It is likely that this need will always beapparent in a segment of the population, and it is also likely that faddists mayharm themselves much less if they lose themselves in the wonders of blackstrapmolasses, kelp, volcanic ash, crude salt, alfalfa, watercress, parsley, and garlicthan if they develop an equally fanatic program invoking other kinds of mis-guided health practices. The specific foods are not like to harm the customer,but delay in seeking medical attention for the vague symptoms faddists love todescribe may be costly. Human beings appear to gravitate toward the simplest explanation of a phe-nomenon. It may be a dishonest answer but it is simple. The faddists arealert to the concerns of the nondiscriminating public and capitalize on fears or,if necessary, create fear. The medical profession honestly admits that a simple, direct, and \"guaranteedor your money back\" cure has not yet been recognized for cancer, diabetes,arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and many other diseases. One would hope that whenmedical knowledge has advanced considerably in a special field, the public wouldbe grateful and would be wary of nonmedical treatment. This has not been truein the case of diabetes. Within recent years, the Food and Drug Administration has taken actionagainst two products, because claims that these drugs were effective againstdiabetes could not be substantiated. The Kaadt Diabetic Institute distributed\"a drug or treatment consisting principally of a mixture of vinegar and po-tassium nitrate (saltpeter); Taka-Diastase, a proprietary digestive preparation,was sometimes added, but analysis revealed no Taka-Diastase because it Is in-activated and destroyed in a solution as strongly acid as the vinegar medicine,\"'Diabena also proved useless to diabetics. ' In part, the label on this drug read:\"Kiabena-alcohol 1292 percent. Active ingredients: tephrosiavirginiana, Uthilcitras, cinnamon, Two teaspoonfuls every 4 hours in water.Children in proportion to age.\" At the present writing, it appears that as long as there are diabetic customers,there will be diabetic \"cures.\" Furthermore, as long as there are diseases forwhich no effective cure is known, the faddists will bridge the gap between thepatient's concern and his pocketbook with miracle products and extravagantpromises.

I344 HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY Label information and advertising copy for a single product may be so com- pletely different that it is sometimes difficult to realize that both could possibly relate to one and the same product. While the label declarations are under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration, advertising claims are under regulations of the Federal Trade Commission. People are motivated to buy a product through the advertising they see or hear. Few consumers will carry an ad with them to the store and try to com- pare the promises in print with the facts presented on the label. The Food and Drug Administration's influence has been evidenced in the area of labeling, but the Federal Trade Commission's regulations have not been much of a handicap to those who wish to write advertising copy in misleading ways. Furthermore, the purveyor of misinformation has time in his favor. The question of the length of time involved in the removal of objectionable products from the market and of misleading advertising from the various communication media was one of the problems discussed at the Blatnik committee hearings.\"0 It is not within the purpose of this paper to discuss the development of the laws now operating to protect the public from misinformation and fraudulence in the field of nutrition. It is suggested, however, that members of the medical profession, collectively and individually, attempt to determine ways in which more money, personnel, research facilities, and effective legislation can be ob- tained so that the faddists will find misleading the public less lucrative and, hence, less alluring than it is now. According to Paul L. Day,' Scientific Director of the Food and Drug Admin- istration,. \"The Federal Government spends less than 7 cents per person each year for protection of foods, drugs, and cosmetics against adulteration, mis- branding, filth, and decomposition; protection against dangerous drugs and cosmetics and the hazards of pesticide residues and radioactivity; and all the other enforcement and research activities of the Food and Drug Administra- tion * 5 *. Expressed in another way, Congress appropriates to the Food and Drug Administration each year less than one-sixth of the cost of one military jet bomber.\" -Accomplishments by our Federal agencies with existing shortages of money and personnel have been noteworthy. The job they face is just too big; no matter how dedicated the- inspectors, sincere the scientists, or eager the admin- istrators, dedication and enthusiasm without adequate staff and funds cannot result in the removal of these serious threats to medical care in the United States. Our programs in nutrition education for children and adults have fallen far short of helping them to make decisions based on facts rather than on the emo- tional and irresponsible appeal of the faddists and charlatans. Education should prove the most effective weapon in limiting the faddists' influence. WhV be concerned! Doorstep diagnosis and mail-order treatment are foolish and vicious. When confidence is placed in nonmedical diagnosis and money is invested in products ranging from pumpkin seeds to Pacific Ocean water, the least the customer will lose is his money, the most-his life. In any event, the customer will be assured that the medical profession has nothing quite like it to offer-thank goodness. Many of the dietary supplements are suggested to cure (or the distributor assumes the freedom to so imply) -as many or more diseases as there are in- gredients on the label. \"Shotgun\" therapy is not new. Andromachus, physician to Nero, once provided his royal patient with a remedy containing 78 ingredients, an. affair only a. little more complex and uncertain than many dietary supple- ments being sold today. History reveals that Andromachus did not give large enough quantities of this toxic mess to kill the patient. In Nero's day, when all products listed in the pharmacopeia were compounded into one medication, the term \"theriaca\" was used.'- Today, we call such prep- arations Although Nutrilite, Visan, and Vit-Ra Tox In- clude somewhat fewer than 78 ingredients, in the filed of nutrition they might be considered present-day theriacas. The cost of membership in health organizations; the cost of lecture series, pills, and health foods; and the support of health ranches are great. Many of the products are sold on a \"plan\" basis. Vitasafe and Day, Administration Faces New Responsibilities,\" Nutri- tion Rev. 18: 1 (January),, 1960.12 Harding, T. S., \"Fads, Frauds, and Physicians,\" New York, the Dial Press, 1930, p. 4.HEALTH FRAUDS AND QUACKERY 345 example, are thus assured of regular delivery and the manufacturer is confident of a steady income. Yet, occasionally, one hears the plaintive cry that \"medical care is too costly; I can't afford it.\" Cook ' reported that in 1957 more than $1 billion was spent for patent medicines and that the Nutrilite Co. alone had more than 20,000 \"distributors\" who sold tens of millions of dollars worth of dietary supplements. In an initial decision \" by a Federal Trade Commission examiner, dated Janu- ary 11, 1960, the statement was made that Mytinger & Casselberry, Inc., have con- tracts with more than 80,000 house-to-house distributors of its Nutrilite food supplement. The Fuller Brush Co. has seen fit to add a line of vitamin and mineral supple- ments. Mail-order vitamins have huge sales volumes, to say nothing of such sales by supermarkets and health food stores. \"Lecturers\" draw large crowds, par- ticularly after they have been \"persecuted\" and sent off for jail sentences, and they do not share their \"fabulous\" discoveries without adequate reimbursement. If all the money spent for empty dreams in the name of food faddism could be directed toward research and education, the solution of some of the unanswered questions in nutrition and in medicine might be forthcoming more rapidly. Finally, choice of food is apt to be erratic. It is likely that if more money is spent on health foods and specific nutrients, it will decrease the contribution of a sensibly planned diet of good American foods. Appreciation of the role of adequate food in health and in sickness will be delayed among thousands of our citizens until the faddists' influence is curtailed and our program of positive education is enlarged. What can be done? To recognize the problem of food faddism for what it is and to recall some of the reasons why it exists are of purely academic interest if we make no concerted effort to combat it. \"Organized medicine has led the fight against quackery, unethical practices, and the misleading promotions of nostrum makers ever since the first meeting of the American Medical Association in Philadelphia in 1847. There, a resolution was introduced calling for renewed vigor in the fight against -> quackery and its attendant evils.\" 's For more than 50 years, the Bureau of Investigation of the American of the Medical Association has been a clearinghouse for information regarding quacks and their methods of operation. For more than 40 years, members of the Ameri- can Dietetic Association have attempted to combat fraud with fact. The Food and Drug Administration has worked diligently; the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 was a milestone in the fight against quackery. The Better Business Bureau and the U.S. Post Office have contributed in a forthright manner. It is obvious, however, that a more vigorous program of education is needed, and the American Medical Association, in cooperation with the-Food and Drug Ad- ministration and the Better Business Bureau, has taken bold steps to provide every interested physician with the information and the tools he needs to assume leadership in a nationwide program to combat ignorance with education in nutrition. The following aids are available for your use in planning a program in your community: 1. A materials kit entitled \"Food Faddism and False Claims\" is available from the American Medical Association. This kit includes reprints, a 20-minute speech, a bibliography and descriptions of a film, and an exhibit recently pre- pared by the association. 2. The film entitled \"The Medicine Man\" is cleared for television use and will also prove helpful in your community program. A small flyer entitled \"The mer- chants of menace\" is planned to be distributed to the film audience, and reprints of \"Let 'em eat hay,\" from the September 1958 issue of Today'8 Health, will provide excellent followup reading for those who have been motivated by the film to appreciate the problem of faddism. The film runs 27 minutes and can serve as an excellent introduction to a lively discussion. The use of this film as part of the community service program of a local medical association is highly recommended. 3. The exhibit on \"Nutrition Nonsense and False Claims\" is so attention gettingthat you will find it necessary to plan for a longtime display. This is also avail- able on loan from the American Medical Association. Is Cook, J.. \"Remedies and Rackets,\" New York, W. W.

The January 3, 1959, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Associa- tion carried a statement on \"Vitamin preparations as dietary supplements and as therapeutic 'agents.\" \" This summarized the recommendations of the council on foods and nutrition relative to kinds and amounts of vitamin and mineral supple- ments considered useful under various conditions of stress. 5. The Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association also has published a compilation of statements and decisions.'7This publication describes recommended 'advertising and terminology for labels and also spells out practices not acceptable in the advertising of food and dietary supplements. Unfortunately, you will find it very easy to assemble examples of the kind of advertising copy which the council on foods and nutrition decries. 6. Your encouragement of greater circulation of the publication, Today's Health, is suggested, because the information on nutrition given in it is accurately and attractively presented. In 1958, this publication carried a series of 12 pa- pers on nutrition. Reprints of these papers are available. 7. The American Dietetic Association ' has published a pamphlet entitled \"Food Facts Talk Back,\" a question and answer presentation. This useful pub- lication is available from the American Dietetic Association, 620 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago. 8. The Nutrition Foundation, Inc.\"5has copies of a pamphlet entitled \"'The Role of Nutrition Education in Combating Food Fads\" available for the asking. The role of the Food and Drug Administration and that of the Federal Trade Commission are described and a brief description of some of the faddists and their products is presented by members of the Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health. 9. In October 1959, the New York Post ran a series of six stories on \"Foods, fads, facts, and phonies.\" It is an excellent series and can be purchased in re- print form. 10. In order to appreciate fully that history is repeating itself, read \"The Golden Age of Quackery.\" '2 It describes some of the multitude of cures available under the leaky umbrella of home remedies prior to 1907, when President Theo- dore Roosevelt's Pure Food and Drug Act altered the products and required honest labeling. While reading this fascinating account of the so-called golden age of quackery, you may wonder how the present era of misleading advertising, nonmedical diagnosing, health store treatment, and nutrition lecturers with pots, pans, pamphlets, and pills will be categorized. Will this be described as the diamond jubilee of food faddism? It is true that narcotics, alcohol, herbs, and bark have been for the most part replaced by vitamins, minerals, seaweed, etc. The distributors have had to keep up to date. Ingredients have changed and the advertising copy has been altered with the years; yet, there is a strange likeness between the events described in \"The Golden Age of Quackery\" and those revealed by James Cook in \"Remedies and Rackets.\" 13 The latter book will be most enjoyed after the former has set the stage. These books supplement each other and together they bring into sharp focus the problem with which the medical profes- sion is faced today. Svmmary Nutritionists look to the medical profession for leadership in the renewed effort to lessen the influence of the quacks who are luring people away from sound dietary practices and ethical medical care. We want to support you in these efforts. When professional groups consider food faddism unimportant, they are by their very indifference lending credence to the old adage that silence lends consent. Tools and information are available to us, but the implementation of an influen- tial program will depend to a very great extent on the conviction and willingness of physicians to speak out loudly 'and effectively. Hopefully, a portion of the 10 million people who now live in the shadow of confusion can be motivated to seek ethical roads to good nutrition and medical care. la Council on Foods and Nutrition, American Medical Association, \"Vitamin Preparations as Dietary Supplements and as Therapeutic Agents,\" JAMA 169: 41 (Jan. a). 1959. 17 Statesments and decisions of the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association, Chicago, 1957. is \"Food Facts Talk Back,\" \"Food Information-Fallacies and Facts,\" Chicago, the American Dietetic Association, 1957. 19 \"The Role of Nutrition Education in Combating Food Fads,\" New York, the Nutrition Foundation, Inc., 1959. soHolbrook, S.
