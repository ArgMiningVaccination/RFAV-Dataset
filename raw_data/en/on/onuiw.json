Few infectious diseases cause such a huge annual toll ofmorbidity, mortality, and economic loss as influenza. Each year, influenza affects mil-lions of people (estimates go up to 5-15% of the world population [1]). The symptoms inhumans range from typical influenza-like effects, like fever, cough, sore throat and mus-cle aches, to eye infections, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, viral pneumonia, andother severe and potentially life-threatening complications [2, 3]. For epidemic influ-enza strains this is especially true for the elderly and other high-risk populations where-as pandemic strains may be very dangerous for all age groups. One method of influenzaprevention and/or treatment is the use of antiviral drugs like M2 proton channel inhi-bitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (zanamivirand oseltamivir). Although these antiviral drugs can be used for prophylaxis and therapy of influ- enza virus infections, vaccination is recognized as the most cost-effective method forcontrolling the disease. Vaccination represents the cornerstone for influenza prevention.Many countries recommend influenza vaccination against epidemic influenza strains forpersons who are at increased risk of influenza complications, persons older than 65 years,residents of nursing homes and health-care workers [4]. However, in a pandemic situa-tion influenza vaccines are expected to form the main prophylactic measure to preventall age groups against pandemic influenza [5]. Until today, the induction of an adequatelevel of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the serum is considered the assurance for influ-enza vaccine efficacy. These antibodies are mainly directed against haemagglutinin (HA)and NA. Current influenza vaccines are mostly inactivated formulations composed of whole inactivated virus, split virus or subunit antigen, i.e. purified HA and NA. However,recently also a cold-adapted live influenza vaccine has entered the market. Today's influ-enza vaccines are all formulated as liquids, in the aqueous environment they are subjec-ted to physical and chemical degradation that may lead to inactivation. Examples of phy-sical degradation processes are: - aggregation,- denaturation,- conformation of HA,- hydrolyses, or- oxidation. Elevated temperatures increase the rate of inactivation of the vaccine compounds, whiletemperatures below the freezing point of the suspension cause formation of ice and so-lute concentration, processes that both may damage the antigen. Therefore (inactivated)influenza vaccines have to be stored within the narrow temperature range of 2 to 8 \u00b0C.This relatively narrow temperature range requires a well-controlled cold chain, whichmakes the process of distribution and storage complicated and expensive. An influenzaCHAPTER II 9vaccine that is stable at ambient temperatures and not sensitive to freezing stresses would reduce the dependency on cold-chain facilities and would therefore be attractive for theintegration of the vaccine logistics with general drug distribution, especially in develo-ping countries. Moreover this would reduce the risk of vaccine losses caused by \"of-label\"storage. Overall this would result in enormous annual savings. In addition, a stable vac-cine formulation would facilitate stockpiling of potential vaccines against pandemicviruses, which provides an immediate availability and simple distribution of vaccine in apandemic situation in both Western as well as developing countries. A commonly usedmethod to stabilize biologically active macromolecules, such as proteins, vaccines andgene delivery systems, is to convert them into a dry-powder formulation. Current inactivated influenza vaccines are generally administered via the intramus- cular (i.m.) route using needles and syringes. Despite its common use, needle basedimmunization has several disadvantages. Needle-phobia along with limited ease of usefor vaccination programs are typical shortcomings of injections [6]. In addition, paren-teral immunizations with influenza vaccines have some limitations in inducing immu-nity. Current i.m. influenza vaccines induce the production of virus-neutralizing anti-bodies in the serum but no cellular and mucosal humoral immune responses at relevantmucosal sites, such as the respiratory tract. As a result, they do not prevent against theinitial replication of the virus in the airways. Needle-free delivery may provide several significant potential advantages in vac- cine delivery: eliminated pain at the injection site; mucosal immune responses (e.g. in therespiratory tract); better efficacy (improved immune responses); easier and faster vac-cine distribution and administration; and reduced costs [7-9]. Therefore, alternative vac-cine delivery systems are in development that delivers the vaccine via epidermal, trans-cutaneous or mucosal routes [10]. However, up till now these approaches suffer fromseveral limitations or practical problems that frequently result in inadequate antibodyresponses or even in a state of immunological tolerance [11]. As a result, marketed influ-enza vaccines, being in the liquid state, are still mainly administered through injection. In the development of new needle-free dosage forms, dried influenza vaccine for- mulations are an interesting tool, that offers the opportunity of a (more) stable product,combined with the facilitation of new or improved targeting strategies of the vaccinecompound. This paper intends to provide an up-to-date perspective on the development of solid influenza vaccines (against epidemic as well as pandemic influenza strains), covering itschallenges, possibilities and potential applications, including the recent developmentsand achievements in this field. After a general brief introduction on the influenza virusand its pathogenesis, four interrelated topics are discussed sequentially: (i) types of influ-enza vaccines, (ii) rationales for the development of dry vaccine formulations, (iii) dry-ing methods for different influenza vaccines and (iv) the development of new needle-free influenza vaccines. The advantages of needle-free solid dosage forms will be revie-wed. However, because also many needle-free liquid state dosage forms have been eva-luated, these approaches will also be discussed. 10Influenza virus Structure Influenza is a respiratory pathogen belonging to the family of the Orthomyxoviridae [12]. There are three types of influenza (A, B, C) distinguished by the antigenic differen- ces in two of their internal proteins, i.e. nucleoprotein and matrix protein. These threetypes of viruses differ in their pathogenicity and genome organization. Influenza A andB viruses are the types that most common cause human disease. Influenza A viruses aresubdivided further into subtypes based on the surface antigens, HA and NA. In influ-enza A viruses 16 subtypes of HA (H1-H16) and 9 subtypes of NA (N1-N9) have beenfound. Influenza A (Fig.1) and B contain negative-stranded segmented RNA (8 segments). Each RNA segment is encapsulated by the nucleoprotein to form a ribonucleotide-CHAPTER II 11Fig. 1 A schematic drawing of the influenza virus. nucleoprotein complex. These complexes are surrounded by a shell of matrix protein (M1), which is enveloped by a lipid bilayer. Besides the two surface glycoproteins, HAand NA, the envelope contains a proton channel (M2 in influenza A and NB in influen-za B). = HA = NA =M1 = M2 =Ribonucleotide- nucleoprotein complex = Lipid bilayerFig. 2 The three-dimensional structure of the influenza HA. The HA monomer (A) and trimer (B). Adapted from: (http://fig.cox.miami.edu/~cmallery/255/255prot/mcb3.7.HA.jpg) HA and NA are the major antigenic determinants of influenza A viruses and as such serve as the basis for subtype classification. HA, the major surface glycoprotein of theinfluenza virus, is responsible for both attachment of the virus to sialic acid containingreceptors on the host cell surface and fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane. HAis a trimer (\u00b1225 kD) 1(\u00b150 kD) and These polypeptides by two intra-monomer disulfide bridges. The three monomersare assembled into a central -helical coiled-coil that forms the stem-like domain, and three globular heads containing sialic acid-binding sites. Each globular domain consistsexclusively of HA 1folded in highly variable loops of eight antiparallel -strands. The glo- bular heads contain both the receptor and the antigenic epitopes [13, 14].The NA cleaves sialic acid and plays an important role in transport of the virus particlesthrough the mucin layer lining the respiratory tract (virus entry) and mediates therelease of newly assembled virus particles (virus release). NA is a tetrameric glycoprotein(\u00b1240 kD) consisting of a hydrophobic stalk and a globular head that contains the enzy-matic and antigenic sites. Entry and replication The influenza virus uses the HA-induced membrane fusion strategy to deliver its ge- nome to the cytosol of target cells (Fig.3). In humans, the primary targets for the influ-enza virus are epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. 12A B Fibrous entry and genome release in the cytosol. The virus attaches to host cells through binding of HA to sialic acid residues of gly- coproteins or glycolipids on the cell surface [15]. Human influenza viruses preferential-ly bind to sialic acid linked to galactose by an 2J6 linkage, while avian viruses bind mainly to sialic acid linked to galactose by an 2J3 linkage [16]. After receptor-binding, virus particles are engulfed by the host cell plasma membrane (endocytosis). In the endo-some (after fusion with the lysosome) the acidification of the environment enables thefusion of the viral membrane with the membrane of the endosome, after which thenucleocapsid can be delivered to the cytoplasm. [17-19]. The endosomal content is aci-dified by proton pumps embedded in the endosomal membrane. This acidification is away to disconnect internalized compounds from the endosomal receptors [20]. Theinfluenza virus uses this low pH inside the endosome (pH 5-6) to trigger the fusion reac-tion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane by a conformationalchange of HA [17]. After fusion, the viral ribonucleotide-nucleoprotein complexes arereleased into the cytoplasm from where they can migrate to the nucleus to initiate repli-cation of the virus [21, 22]. Immunity, antigenic drift and shift New (drifted) influenza strains are constantly formed by changes in HA and NA. Influenza viruses lack proof-reading mechanisms and are therefore unable to repair(RNA-) errors that occur during replication. These mutations accumulate within theviral genome, resulting in replacement of the existing strain by a new antigenic variant.This mechanism of acquiring new mutations is known as antigenic drift. These muta-tions are seen in each of the gene products of the virus. However, it is most pronouncedin amino acid changes in the surface proteins HA and NA. In contrast to the antigenic drift, that constantly occurs, the antigenic shift occurs at irregular intervals with more dramatic changes in the viral proteins. Antigenic shiftstarts by either direct introduction of new avian influenza viruses into the human popu-lation or reassortment between human and avian viruses, which is believed to occur viaintermediate hosts such as pigs [23]. Aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of all knownCHAPTER II 13subtypes of the influenza A virus. These birds are highly mobile and are known to carry viruses over great distances. In addition, they transfer viruses to other birds via theexcretion of large quantities of virus in their faeces. While remaining perfectly healthythese birds form a mobile pool from which an influenza pandemic can arise [3, 24]. It ispossible that an avian influenza virus changes, by antigenic shift or drift, so that it is ableto infect humans. Because these viruses do not commonly infect humans, there is littleor no immune protection against them in the human population. Consequently, if anavian virus is able to infect people, it can spread easily from person to person, by whichan influenza pandemic, a global outbreak, could arise [25, 26].Once in several decades an influenza pandemic occurs. An influenza pandemic occurswhen an influenza strain with a novel HA subtype (with or without a novel NA sub-type) appears and spreads in the human population, which has little or no immunity tothe novel HA. There have been three such pandemics in the twentieth century: in 1918,1957, and 1968. At this moment there is for birds a new highly pathogenic influenza sub-type (H5N1), which forms potentially a high risk-factor for a new pandemic [24]. Thesenew viruses may cause pandemics since few or no people have had prior immunologicexposure to their surface proteins [27]. 14Influenza vaccines The currently used vaccines are (mainly inactivated) formulations containing the two surface antigens, HA and NA. There are four different types of inactivated influenza vac-cines; split, subunit, whole inactivated influenza vaccines and virosomal influenza vac-cines. Recently also a live attenuated influenza vaccine reached the market [28]. The vac-cines are trivalent, containing the antigens from two subtypes of influenza A and oneinfluenza B as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for each hemis-phere. To ensure an antigenic match with new circulating influenza viruses, the compo-sition of these trivalent vaccines is updated, on basis of WHO's worldwide surveillanceof new influenza strains twice a year. Following vaccination with influenza A, around90% of normal subjects achieve serum haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers higherthan 40, a level generally associated with protection of about 50% of the population. Asa result, implemented criteria for vaccine immunogenicity are based on the induction ofan adequate level of virus-neutralizing antibodies [29]. Influenza virus for vaccines is generally produced by propagation of virus in embry- onated hen's eggs, although recent developments include vaccine virus production incultured cells, such as MDCK (Madin-Darby-Canine-Kidney), Vero cells (derived an minigene of adenovirus type 5) [30-33]. The virus (inallantoic fluid) is harvested, concentrated and (highly) purified. The virus is subsequent-ly inactivated with formaldehyde or -propiolactone and processed to the vaccine type of choice. Split / subunit vaccine Most inactivated influenza vaccines are supplied as split vaccines, produced from the chemically disrupted influenza virus, or as subunit vaccines containing predominantlypurified HA and NA. Millions of doses of these influenza vaccines are administered byintramuscular or subcutaneous injection throughout the world each year. These vaccinestrigger the humoral immune system to produce serum antibodies directed against HAand NA. These serum antibodies play a role in both resistance to and recovery frominfluenza infection [4]. The resistance to influenza infection, especially protectionagainst severe viral pneumonia, is caused by transudation of haemagglutinin-specificserum antibodies from the blood into the lungs [34, 35]. The overall rate of adverse reac-tions of split and subunit vaccine is very low. As a result of this low incidence of adver-se effects, the use of split or subunit preparations is first choice in children younger than9 years. However, the overall efficacy of current vaccinations is not optimal in the elder-ly [29]. This appears to be primarily related to a diminishing T cell activity with age [36, 37]. Moreover, the presentation form of conventional split and subunit vaccines issuboptimal for stimulation of cell-mediated immunity, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)activity in particular, which is of crucial importance for the destruction of virus-infectedcells and thus the clearance of influenza virus infections [37].CHAPTER II 15Whole inactivated virus vaccine In contrast to split and subunit vaccines who are made from disrupted viruses, whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines contain inactivated influenza virus particles (virions)retaining the receptor binding and membrane fusion activity of the native virus.Although limited evidence is present today about the exact interaction of WIV with cellsof the immune system, some hypothetical principles were described. Fig. 4 shows a sche-matic hypothesis how WIV may interact with cells (like B lymphocytes and dendriticcells (DCs)) of the immune system. The HA and NA spikes protruding from the WIV membrane can be recognized by membrane-associated immunoglobulin receptor molecules on B lymphocytes. The repe-titive arrangement of the antigens on the WIV surface presumably enables cross-linkingof these immunoglobulin receptors on the B cells [29] which is known to be an enormousstrong activation signal [38]. By virtue of their membrane fusion activity, these WIV vaccines activate not only the humoral but also the cellular arm of the immune system [29]. Although cell-media-ted immunity does not seem to contribute significantly in preventing infection, it playsa role in the recovery from influenza infection and may prevent influenza-associatedcomplications [4]. WIV vaccines activate the cellular arm of the immune system by vir-tue of their membrane fusion activity. As for the native influenza virus, binding of WIVto the sialic acid receptors will initiate uptake of WIV by the receptor-mediated endocy-tosis. In the lumen of the WIV membrane fuses with the endosomal mem-brane resulting in release of the nucleocapsid compounds (RNA, nucleoprotein andmatrix protein) into the cytosol of the antigen presenting cell (APC). However, no repli-cation occurs, since replication is blocked due to modified nucleic bases (mainly purines)in the viral genome caused by the virus-inactivation step with formaldehyde or -pro- piolactone [39]. Subsequently, the nucleocapsid compounds may be processed and presented via the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I presentation route resulting in CTL activation[40-42]. A part of the WIV is already degraded within the endosome (or lysosome) resul-ting in generation of peptides derived from the viral (surface as well as encapsulated)proteins. These peptides can be processed and presented via the MHC class II presenta-tion route resulting in strong T helper responses which play an essential role in the sti-mulation of CTLs as well as in the support of antibody-forming B cells. Therefore, vac-cination with WIV activates both the humoral and cellular arm of the adaptive immuneresponse and has been shown to be more immunogenic than split or subunit vaccines [4,42-46]. Moreover, WIV vaccines are expected to induce more subtype cross-reactive cel-lular responses directed against conserved proteins [4, 41,47, 48]. However, WIV vaccines are associated with frequent local and systemic adverseeffects, like pain and redness at the injection site or fever. Therefore they are less suita-ble for the use in young children. The use of WIV vaccines is limited and in many coun-tries they are unlicensed [49]. 16Fig. 4 Hypothetical interaction of WIV with cells of the immune system. Based on: [29]. Virosomal vaccines A relative novel class of inactivated influenza vaccines is the virosomal influenza vac- cine. Virosomes are virus-like particles, consisting of reconstituted influenza virus en-velopes, which do not contain the genetic material of the native virus [29]. Virosomesare produced from influenza virus through a detergent solubilization and removal pro-cedure [50-52]. If produced properly, reconstituted virosomes retain the HA mediatedcell binding and membrane fusion properties of the native virus. As a result virosomes,like WIV, posses the functional characteristics for a potentially enhanced immunogeni-city. First, the repetitive arrangement of the antigens on the virosomal surface may en-able a cooperative interaction of the antigen with immunoglobulin receptors on B lym-phocytes, stimulating strong antibody responses [29]. In addition, virosomes may inter-act efficiently with antigen-presenting cells, resulting in efficient uptake and transportof the virosomes to the endosome (and lysosome), where a part of the virosomes is degra-ded and a part fuses with the endosomal membrane. The peptides derived from thedegraded viral surface proteins (HA and NA) might be processed and presented via theMHC class II presentation route resulting in strong T helper responses which play anessential role in the stimulation of CTLs as well as in the support of antibody-forming Bcells. Parallel to this, due to the fusion of the virosomes with the endosomal membranea part of the virosomal antigen (encapsulated surface antigen) gains access to the MHCclass I presentation route (via the cytosol) resulting in CTL activation. As a result viroso-mes induce both high virus-neutralizing antibody titers and prime the cellular arm of theimmune system. In contrast to WIV, virosomes do not lead to presentation of peptidefragments of the nucleocapsid via the both MHC classes. However, virosomes presentpeptide fragments of (encapsulated) influenza surface antigens (HA and NA) via MHCclass I presentation which is not seen with WIV. Recently commercial virosomal influ-enza vaccines have become available under the trade names Inflexal V \u00ae and Invivac\u00ae.CHAPTER II 17T helper lymphocyteMHC I ?WWIIVV Degradation AntibodiesB cellCompared to conventional inactivated subunit influenza vaccine, local reactions are reported at a lower frequently with virosomal vaccines, whereas the reporting rates ofsystemic side effects are comparable between the two vaccine types [53]. Live (attenuated) influenza vaccines Besides the marketed vaccines, recent developments resulted in the design and authori- zation (in the USA) of a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), Flumist \u00ae. In contrast to the inactivated influenza vaccines which are administered by intramuscular or subcu-taneous injection, this LAIV is administered intranasally (0.25 ml in each nostril). TheLAIV is administered via a spray device that produces aerosols with large droplets whichare deposited in the nasopharynx [28]. LAIV, a 6/2 reassortant, contains the genes enco-ding the 6 internal segments from the attenuated donor strain (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NP andNS) and the 2 surface proteins (HA and NA) of the wild-type virus. The donor strain iscold-adapted (CA) by genetic modification and as such capable to grow in human nasalcavities (\u00b132\u00b0C) but not in internal organs such as the lungs (>37\u00b0C) [28]. The underly-ing idea of vaccination with LAIV via the upper respiratory tract (nose) is to induce asecretory and systemic immune response that more closely resembles the immune res-ponse observed after natural infection. LAIVs induce a broad mucosal and systemicimmune response. This in contrast, to the current inactivated influenza vaccines thatbecause of their systemic administration only stimulate the systemic (higher HI titersthan LAIV) and not the mucosal immune system [4]. However, LAIV nasal vaccines andinactivated i.m. vaccines are found to be similarly efficacious in preventing influenza ill-ness from homologous virus infections [54, 55]. In contrast to injected inactivated influ-enza vaccines, LAIVs are believed to provide broader immunity against circulating hete-rologous virus strains. This broader immunity might be the result of mucosal IgA and thehigh MHC class I presentation induced by high presentation of viral compounds into thecytosol of the APC, especially the nucleoprotein and matrix proteins produced by repli-cation after infection. The feature of CA virus to replicate, the possibility to prime theimmune system of na\u00efve persons, may result in a vaccine that is more immunogenic inyoung children than inactivated vaccines [4]. To date, it is unclear whether CA vaccinesare also safe in immunocompromised patients [4]. Vaccine stability In the liquid state the stability of influenza vaccine is limited. The stability of new vac- cine compositions is tested by the manufacturer in order to support regulatory filing andfor GMP compliance. The stability is determined by investigation of a.o. the content ofHA antigen, presence of NA, pH, content of preservative (if applicable) and appearance.The result of the most sensitive parameter, in general the HA content (HA potency),determines the shelf-life of the product [56]. Stability studies are generally performedaccording to ICH guidelines [57, 58]. Stability depends among others on vaccine strain[59], pH, addition of stabilizers such as gelatin or polysorbate, compatibility of the pro-duct with container and closure and preparative treatments needed to reduce adsorptionor interaction with the container [56]. Most inactivated influenza vaccines are stable for 18Fig. 5 Visual observation of freeze-induced damage caused by accidental storage below 0\u00b0C. The left bott- le contains the original subunit vaccine. The right bottle contains the freeze-damaged subunit vaccine. Thefreeze-thaw cycle resulted in a turbid, less opalescent vaccine solutionRationale for the development of stabilized vaccine formulations Cold chain Inactivated influenza vaccines are temperature sensitive and must be stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C. Elevated temperatures can cause inactivation of the vaccine antigens, while temperatu-res below freezing result in formation of ice and solute concentration that may causedenaturation of the antigen [59-61]. The narrow temperature range makes the process ofdistribution and storage complicated, fragile and costly. Although it was demonstratedthat the influenza subunit vaccine could be stored for a couple of days outside the refri-gerator at room temperature [59], vaccine distribution remains one of the greatest riskfor vaccine quality, especially when the vaccine passes the central storage depots. Duringtransport to and storage at local level (general practitioners) the risk of storage outsidethe temperature range (2-8\u00b0C) increases. Freeze-sensitive vaccines are still carried withfrozen ice packs and/or improperly conditioned ice packs risking that they will be expo-sed to freezing temperatures. Sometimes improper storage can be detected. For example,time-temperature indicators (VVMs=vaccine vial monitors) can prevent usage of vacci-nes that were stored too long at elevated temperatures. In certain cases freezing-induceddamage can be detected visually (Fig. 5), with or without a shake-test. However in manycases no clear visual changes are observed [62].CHAPTER II 19about one year in the refrigerator (2 to 8\u00b0C). In contrast to inactivated influenza vacci- nes, live attenuated influenza vaccines must be stored frozen (-15\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C). To over-come the freezing stresses, the three live attenuated influenza virus reassortants ofFluMist \u00aeare stabilized with phosphate glutamate buffer, containing sucrose. Before use the vaccine must be thawed (for up to 60 hours at 2 to 8\u00b0C) and should not be refrozen.However, a refrigerator stable formulation is in development [56].An influenza vaccine that is stable at room temperature, or even somewhat higher temperatures (up to 35\u00b0C), and is not sensitive to freezing stresses would reduce thedependency on cold-chain facilities. Such a vaccine would considerably simplify vac-cine distribution and enable the integration of vaccine logistics with general drug distri-bution, especially in developing countries. Moreover, this would reduce vaccine losses.Both aspects would result in enormous annual cost savings. Stock piling Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus infections in poultry and humans have raised concerns that a new influenza pandemic might occur in the nearfuture. The key preventive method to protect the population against a pandemic virus isan influenza vaccine [63]. In the most extreme scenario, adequate pandemic prepared-ness would mean the availability of 13 billion doses of vaccine (2 doses for 6.5 billionpeople) to vaccinate the world population. However, today's global production capacityof trivalent influenza vaccine is around 400 million doses per year and the time neededuntil the first vaccine dose can be used is at least 4 months [12, 64]. As a result the WHOhas encouraged every member state to produce a pandemic preparedness plan. Such aplan would guarantee fair distribution of vaccine and pre-organized vaccine supply in aclearly defined manner. A new feature discussed is stockpiling of vaccine from different strains assuring immediate availability [63, 64]. Although such vaccines would not be a perfect match toa newly emerged influenza A H1-H16 virus, some intertypic immunity and immunolo-gical priming would be expected to ameliorate the effects of the initial pandemic wave.Current seasonal (inactivated) influenza vaccines have a shelf-life claim of one year only.In contrast, stable vaccine formulations of the H1-H16 subtypes would not only reducethe dependency on the cold chain, but could also increase the shelf-life of the vaccines.As a result such a stable vaccine formulation would facilitate stockpiling of potential vac-cines against pandemic viruses and provide in immediately available and simple to dis-tribute vaccine in a pandemic situation. In the ideal situation this would imply that forexample from 3 HA types (e.g. H5, H7 and H9) a powder amount equivalent to about 12 billion doses is stockpiled in bottles containing for example 100-200 doses. In case ofemergency such bottles do only have to be distributed and reconstituted before use. 20Stabilization of biopharmaceuticals by incorporation in sugar glasses The most commonly used method to stabilize biologically active macromolecules, such as proteins, vaccines and gene delivery systems, is to convert them to dry powders. Ingeneral biopharmaceuticals are more stable in the solid state than in the liquid state. Thisis believed to be related to mobility of the biopharmaceutical and the absence or reduc-tion of certain degradation pathways such as hydrolysis. However, depending on thedrying method, freezing and/or drying stresses may affect the structural integrity and/oractivity of the biopharmaceutical. Accordingly, appropriate stabilizers are required forpreservation of these properties. It is well known that sugars can stabilize proteins [65-70], liposomes, lipoplexes [71-76] and various viruses [77-80] during drying and subse-quent storage. If dried properly, the active substance, complex or vesicle is incorporatedin a matrix consisting of amorphous sugar in its glass state. The stabilizing effect of thesesugar glasses has been explained by the formation of a sugar matrix which acts as a phy-sical barrier between particles (particle isolation) and strongly reduces diffusion andmolecular mobility (vitrification). Both the physical barrier [81] and the lack of mobili-ty provided by the glass matrix [82], prevent aggregation and degradation of the biophar-maceutical. Moreover, during the drying process, the sugar replaces the water moleculesin the hydrogen-bonding interaction with the active material, such that the structuralintegrity of the drug is preserved [83]. Under dry conditions, the glass matrix is maintai-ned as long as the temperature is kept below the glass transition temperature (T g), which is characteristic for the stabilizing sugar used. In summary carbohydrates are suitable excipients because: - most carbohydrates contain hydroxyl groups that can form hydrogen bonds with the active compound; - some carbohydrates possess a high T g(e.g. trehalose or inulin), and - in general sugars are considered as safe.CHAPTER II 21Strategies for stabilization of influenza vaccines and vaccine integrity Potentially there are a number of different drying methods that can be used to dry the influenza vaccine (with the required excipients) to a stable powder. The major methodswith their advantages and disadvantages are given in table 1. 22Atomiza- Freezing Heating Process Crystalliza- Particle Capacity Costs Industrial tionstress stress stress speed tion risk design experience Already at first glance it is clear that not all drying methods are suitable and the ideal method has certainly not been found yet. Each of the methods has typical advanta-ges as well as drawbacks, of which the relevance and magnitude may furthermore bedetermined by the applied process conditions as well as the formulation (excipientsused). There are a number of relevant aspects that determine the suitability of a specificdrying method. Most important in this respect are process stresses, crystallization risk,process speed, ease to design particles, capacity, recovery, costs and current (industrial)experience (Table 1). In the past decades several papers have been published in which dried influenza vaccines were used/described (Table 2). Most of these dried influenza vaccines were pro-duced in order to facilitate new needle-free dosage forms for nasal, pulmonary or epider-mal delivery. The integrity and stability of the influenza vaccine compound after dryingis examined in only a limited number of the published articles. From these studies it isdifficult to draw definite conclusions with regard to the influences of process and formu-lation parameters on vaccine integrity and stability. However, it is possible to extra-polate general concepts described in literature concerning drying of biopharmaceuticalsas discussed in the proceding paragraphs.Table 1.Drying methods and their advantages/disadvantages for drying of biopharmaceuticals.

Upon cooling of a sugar solution of composition A, water starts to crystallize below 0\u00b0C (point B). During freezing, the crystallization temperature of the remaining waterdecreases due to freeze point depression by the solute. At the eutectic temperature (T e, point C) the sugar should start to crystallize simultaneously with the water molecules ifthe solution would be in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, when the solution israpidly frozen, e.g. in liquid nitrogen or dry ice, the crystallization rate is too slow forthe sugar to form crystals. As a consequence, rapid cooling below the T eresults in fur- ther crystallization of water only and so-called freeze concentration of the sugar (andactive compound) continues. At the glass-(rubber-)transition temperature of the maxi- 24Freeze drying and spray-ffreeze drying The process Generally, freeze-drying (lyophilization) is the preferred drying method for biopharma- ceuticals [95]. Freeze-drying is a process by which the material is frozen and subsequent-ly dried by the removal of (frozen) water by sublimation (directly from the solid phaseto gas) under reduced pressure. The principle of sugar glass production by lyophilization is illustrated by the state- diagram of a binary sugar/water system presented in Fig. 6. The figure is illustrative forthe process by which a biopharmaceutical is incorporated in a glassy matrix of sugarusing lyophilization. However, for the sake of clarity the contributions of the biophar-maceutical and buffer compounds are neglected in the state diagram.mally freeze-concentrated fraction (Tg', point D), the viscosity increases dramatically resulting in immobilization of the sugar and water (and further components), and a glassis formed. In this glass the sugar molecules are randomly orientated (amorphous state)and form a vitrified matrix in which water and biopharmaceutical are captured. Due tothe high viscosity of the amorphous matrix the composition of the glass remains the same(also water molecules do not crystallize) upon further cooling (D JE). To obtain the biopharmaceutical in a dry amorphous glass, the frozen sample is kept under vacuum and water is removed by sublimation. During primary drying, the firststage of the sublimation process, the ice formed during freezing of the sample is remo-ved. The temperature during this primary drying must be held below the T g'. This is essential because above this temperature the sugar glass turns into the rubbery state inwhich the molecular mobility is considerably increased and crystallization of the sugaror phase separation may occur. This is detrimental for the stabilization of the incorpora-ted biopharmaceutical compound since hydrogen bonds or other stabilizing interactionswith the sugar are lost and the translational freedom of the biopharmaceutical increases,which could cause aggregation. In addition, the mechanical forces induced by crystalli-zation of the sugar may damage the structure of the biopharmaceutical compound,which in turn may lose functional activity. The remaining water molecules captured in the glassy matrix upon rapid cooling are removed during the secondary drying when the sugar surface is free of ice. During thissecondary drying the temperature can slowly be increased as long as the temperature isbelow the T gof the water-containing product (E JF). After removal of all water, the bio- pharmaceutical compound is incorporated in a dry sugar glass with a Tgdepending on the composition and on the sugar used. To assure a long shelf-life, the dry formulationshould be stored below its T gto avoid transition into the rubbery state (which could result in crystallization). Moreover, generally a highly porous cake with a high specificsurface area is obtained after lyophilization, which can be easily reconstituted. However,this porous cake also easily absorbs water. As a result the product should be kept at a lowrelative humidity (adequate packaging required), since water decreases the T gof the for- mulation (see glass transition curve as function of water content). Spray-freeze drying (SFD) is a relative new drying process to produce biopharma- ceutical powders that combines atomization, generating a cloud of small droplets (lea-ding to rapid freezing), and lyophilization. The state-diagram of incorporation of a bio-pharmaceutical in a glassy matrix of sugar by SFD is almost the same as that of normallyophilization (Fig. 6). A liquid solution containing a biopharmaceutical compound andstabilizer(s) is atomized into a cryogenic medium, in general liquid nitrogen, to vitrifythe droplets (A JE), followed by removal of ice and water molecules (captured in the glassy matrix) by lyophilization (E JF)]. A main advantage of SFD over normal freeze drying is the extremely rapid vitrification (fast A JE traject) due to the enormous surfa- ce area for heat transfer generated during the atomization (the spraying process) and adirect contact of the liquid droplets with the freezing medium. This is important sincerapid vitrification prevents phase separation. Moreover, the large surface area allows arapid drying. Another advantage of SFD is the capability to produce spherical particles. CHAPTER II 25Freeze drying and spray-freeze drying of influenza vaccines Freeze drying and spray-freeze drying have been used for drying of influenza vaccines. During drying, various factors can affect the integrity of the vaccine compound. Thesefactors are mostly dependent on the drying method used. Lyophilization, for exampleraises concerns related to typical stresses induced during freezing and drying. In respon-se to freezing, multiple ice crystals of various sizes grow and interact with the freeze con-centrated fraction (the highly viscous fluid phase containing non-crystalline componentsand the remaining non-frozen water). During this process, an enormous ice/liquid inter-face is created that presents a surface area for protein adsorption. This may result in con-formational changes and disruption of the vaccine compound. Moreover, the solute con-centration of the non-frozen fraction increases during freezing, resulting in accelerationof reaction kinetics [96] and changed physical properties such as ionic strength and rela-tive composition of the solution, which may further destabilize the vaccine [95, 97]. HA in influenza subunit vaccines is susceptible to freezing stresses, especially at low freezing rates (higher freezing temperatures), as revealed by various spectroscopic tech-niques [60, 61]. However, Amorij et al. showed that sugars (trehalose, inulin and dex-tran) can prevent freeze induced damage as revealed by tryptophan spec-troscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy In the development of lyophilized influenza vaccines (as for several other biophar- maceuticals) the choice of buffer type has been shown to be of major importance [61, 98].Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) is an often used buffer for biopharmaceutical com-pounds. However, the use of PBS during lyophilization of subunit vaccine results in pHchanges leading to conformational changes of HA [61]. This is a typical example of com-position changes during freezing that may destabilize a vaccine compound. Due to thecrystallization of sodium or potassium dibasic phosphate during freezing, the formula-tion pH of the PBS shows a downshift. By nature, HA within the influenza virus posses-ses a spring-loaded conformation that changes upon acidification in the endosome (pH \u00b15) in order to mediate fusion of the virus (see Entry and replication). As a result HAis sensitive to acidification like pH changes caused by freezing of PBS. The conformatio-nal changes of HA during freezing could be prevented by the use of another buffer, hepesbuffered saline (HBS). Hepes does not crystallize and consequently no strong pH changesoccur during freezing [61]. Moreover, a fast freezing rate and the use of sugars, like tre-halose, inulin or dextran, are aspects that may result in a vaccine powder with conserva-tion of the vaccine with full maintenance of structure [61]. Different influenza vaccines have been dried by lyophilization. Subunit and split vaccines have been successfully (spray-) freeze dried with conservation of the antigen'smolecular structure, potency and/or antigenicity in mice [61, 84, 85]. Maa et al. produced a vaccine powder of a trivalent split vaccine by SFD using com- binations of sugars. They found that combinations of trehalose, mannitol and dextran atdifferent solid contents in the feed solution (20-30 %w/v) were capable to preserve theantigen's potency in vivo during 26Whole inactivated virus vaccine has been successfully lyophilized by Huang et al. [91]. They lyophilized a mixture of whole inactivated virus and trehalose in a ratio of1:500 (10 g virus/5 mg trehalose) from sterile saline. After lyophilization, subsequent milling and reconstitution whole capacitywith g/ml) by lyophilized with inulin These viroso-mes retained their fusogenic properties in vitro and antigenicity in mice. In contrast, lyophilization of virosomes without protectant resulted in reduced fusogenic propertiesand disruption of the vesicular structure of the virosomes.CHAPTER II 27Fig. 7 A state-diagram of a binary sugar/water system and the incorporation of a biopharmaceutical in a glassy matrix of sugar by spray drying (A JC, assuming a homogeneous composition within the droplets). A = starting compositionB = point where the sugar solution (in the droplets) passes the crystallization curve of sugarC = spray dried product in the amorphous glassy state Spray drying starts with atomization of a sugar solution of composition A (and tem- perature A) in the hot air of the spray dryer. Through the atomizing of the solution acloud of droplets is created. Just after atomizing, the droplet surface remains moisture-saturated and by the endothermal process of water evaporation the droplet temperatureremains significantly lower than the hot air temperature. During evaporation of thewater the remaining concentration of sugar in the droplet increases (A JB). During dry- ing the droplet temperature begins to rise (A JB) as water diffusion to the surface can- not keep the surface moisture-saturated, while due to evaporation the air temperaturesignificantly decreases. At a certain concentration (point B) the sugar should start tocrystallize simultaneously with the evaporation of the water molecules under conditions 28Spray drying The process Spray drying is the process of drying a liquid feed into dry particles through atomization of the feed (generating a cloud of small droplets) into a hot drying gas. Usually air is used,but sensitive materials and solvents like ethanol may require oxygen-free drying withnitrogen gas instead. Spray drying can be used for biopharmaceuticals. The incorpora-tion of a biopharmaceutical in a glassy matrix of sugar by spray drying is illustrated bythe state-diagram of a binary sugar/water system presented in Fig. 7. The contribution ofthe biopharmaceutical is neglected, since it is usually present in low amounts. While inlyophilization low temperatures are used to rapidly vitrify the biopharmaceutical, spraydrying uses a rapid moisture removal at elevated temperature to vitrify the biopharma-cetical.that the solution is in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, when the evaporation rate of water is fast enough, the glass transition temperature of the dried formulation is abovethe outlet temperature and the crystallization rate too slow for the sugar to form cryst-als. Consequently, the sugar will pass through rubbery state (B JC) and turns into the dry amorphous glassy state. However, spray drying is not a process without concerns. First, the vaccine com- pound may suffer from heat denaturation by hot air. Although the droplet temperatureonly increases marginally as a result of heat absorption by the evaporated water, it is wiseto use process parameters, like a relatively low inlet air temperature, in order to assurethe outlet temperature is not too high and consequently reduce the risk of denaturati-on/degradation of the vaccine compound. Secondly, air-water interfacial stresses andshear stresses induced by the atomization of the feed solution may lead to degradation ofthe biopharmaceutical. Biopharmaceuticals, vaccine compounds such as HA, NA andlipids, being (amphiphilic) membrane components, all posses surface active properties.As a result, the biopharmaceuticals tend to be adsorbed to the air water interface (thefine droplets have a high specific surface area) where the large surface free energy maycause the biopharmaceutical to be disrupted and to expose its hydrophobic regions resul-ting in aggregation. Again the use of sugars may prevent deterioration by increases unfolding tempera- tures of the (proteinous) biopharmaceutical. In general, sugars that easily crystallize andhave a relative low T gare not suitable for spray-drying. However, formulations that crystallize less easily and have a high Tgcan be made [99-102]. Spray drying of influenza vaccines Spray drying has been used to prepare dried influenza subunit and WIV vaccines.Various sugars can be used for the spray drying of proteinous compounds. However,during spray drying mono- and disaccharides with a low Tg have the tendency to crys-tallize resulting in degradation of the biopharmaceutical [103-106]. Crucial in spray dry-ing of proteins is the tendency of proteins, being amphiphilic, to adsorp at the air-liquidinterface of droplets in the aerosol, which may result in unfolding and aggregation [107].Therefore, the addition of surface-acting agents (surfactants) to the mixture before spraydrying has been used to remove proteins from this interface and consequently improvetheir stability [96, 104, 108]. Recently, we developed a strategy to prepare an influenza subunit vaccine powder by spray drying using the oligosaccharide inulin (inulin 4 g/ml) and inulin (55 mg/ml) in PBS was spray dried using a Mini Spray Dryer. The vaccine powder obtained after spray drying consis-ted of spherical and smooth particles with an average particle size of 3 m. Moreover, the process stresses did not have an adverse effect on the antigen's immunogenicity in vivo (Fig. 8). CHAPTER II 29Fig. 8 Vaccine antigenicity of spray dried influenza subunit vaccine. The vaccine was dried with inulin as stabilizer, using a 5.5 % w/v sugar solution at a ratio sugar/HA = 200. IgG serum in BALB/c mice. Animals were immunized i.m (on day 0, 14 and28) with 5 g subunit antigen (A/Panama) from reconstituted spray dried subunit vacci- ne (n=8). On day 52 mice were sacrificed and titers were determined according to [61]. The results are expres-sed as the geometric mean titer \u00b1 standard deviation for each group. Spray-dried lipid-based microparticles (SDLM) have been used to encapsulate subu- nit and WIV vaccine in microparticles in order to target APC in the respiratory tract [11,93]. Besides vaccine these microparticles consisted of lipid-surfactants, DPPC and DSPC(75-85% w/w; both surfactants occur in the lung), and a polysaccharide, hydroxyethyl-starch (HES). The release of antigens (pharmaceutical availability) from these SDLMswas limited, but co-formulation with the biocompatible surfactant tyloxapol improvedthe immune profile of these particles [11]. However, it is unclear whether the structuralintegrity of the vaccine compounds was affected by the drying process, since only a bio-assay based on peptide recognition and SDS-treatment was used to determine the antigen content. 30Fig. 9 State-diagram of a binary sugar/water system and the incorporation of a biopharmaceutical in a glas- sy matrix of sugar by vacuum drying or desiccation at a constant (isothermal) temperature (A JC). A = starting compositionB = point where the sugar solution passes the crystallization curve of sugarC = dried product in the amorphous glassy state.Vacuum drying and desiccation The process Vacuum drying or vacuum evaporation is the process of drying at a pressure where the boiling point of water has been lowered below the temperature of drying. The incorpo-ration of a biopharmaceutical in a glassy matrix of sugar by vacuum drying (and desicca-tion) is illustrated in Fig. 9.CHAPTER II 31A liquid solution of composition A is subjected to vacuum (<3.17 kPa at 25\u00b0C) and starts to boil. Constant addition of heat is necessary to prevent the sample to cool fromheat loss by evaporation. At a certain point the sugar solution is saturated (point B); thesugar should start to crystallize simultaneously with the evaporation of the water mole-cules when the solution is in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, when the evapo-ration rate of water is fast enough and the crystallization rate will be too slow for thesugar to form crystals, the sugar will pass through rubbery state (B JC) and turn into the dry amorphous glassy state. Desiccation is the process of drying using a hygroscopic substance (a desiccant) in a sealed container (desiccator). During desiccation small amounts of material are driedon a shelf above a drying agent or desiccant, such as dry silica gel or anhydrous causticsoda. Just as vacuum drying this drying process is carried out above 0\u00b0C, at room tem-perature or elevated temperatures. In contrast to spray drying that only takes a moment, vacuum drying and desiccati- on can take hours. As a result the risk of crystallization and/or phase separation of thesugar and biopharmaceutical from the rubbery state increases. Despite this increasedrisk, it should be realized that these drying methods offer the opportunity to dry withoutheating or freezing stresses and can be performed at low costs.Vacuum drying/desiccation of influenza vaccines Air drying and desiccation have been used for preparing dry subunit and split influenza vaccines. In different laboratories, subunit vaccine has been air dried after dispersing 0.5ml vaccine on 1 g D-xylose [86, 90]. Chen et al prepared dried split vaccine powder bydesiccation a vaccine in trehalose (100 mg/ml) solution overnight using an N 2purge [88, 89]. Although these researchers performed immunization studies it was not investigatedwhether the integrity of the vaccine compound in their dried product was affected. Theintegrity of the vaccine is a concern with these specific drying techniques. These dryingprocesses need a long drying time during which the sugar vaccine mixture passes relati-ve slowly the intermediate rubbery state [109]. Consequently sugar crystallization andsubsequent diminished stability of the vaccine compound are a risk. Especially for mono-and disaccharides, like D-xylose and trehalose, that may easily crystallize, this riskshould be taken seriously [105, 109-111]. 32 Fig. 10 A pressure-temperature diagram for pure CO2.Supercritical drying A relative new drying method is supercritical fluid (SCF) drying (reviewed in: [112] and [113]). SCF drying makes use of a fluid that is supercritical i.e. when both pressure andtemperature are above the critical pressure (P c) and critical temperature (Tc), respective- ly (Fig. 10). Above the critical temperature, it is not possible to convert a gas in the liquidstate by increasing the pressure. However, the density of the gas increases continuouslywith increasing pressure. The supercritical fluid has gas-like physical properties, such asa high diffusity and low viscosity [114]. The application of SCFs by pharmaceutical com-panies is restricted to supercritical CO 2(SC-CO2), because this SCF is generally regarded as safe by the FDA, available in large quantities at high purity, inexpensive, has a low Tc (31,5\u00b0C) etc.. However, until now no influenza vaccines have been dried by supercriticaldrying. There are two main principles of SCF drying which may be applicable for dryingand formulation of influenza vaccines. The first concept is spray drying in a supercritical fluid. A vaccine sugar solution is sprayed by atomization into a vessel containing SC-CO 2. Although SC-CO2is not com- pletely miscible with water it dissolves in the vaccine sugar solution. However, the vac-cine compound and sugar are poorly soluble in SC-CO 2(antisolvent). As a result the sol- vent in the vaccine sugar droplets loses solvent power and becomes supersaturated. Thisin combination with the water transfer from the supersaturated droplets to the SC-CO 2 (extraction) leads to the incorporation of the vaccine compound in a glassy matrix ofsugar. Critical in this process is the mass transfer of water to ensure a rapid dehydrationin order to prevent crystallization of the stabilizing sugar. The mass transfer can beimproved by decreasing the droplet size, decreasing the relative velocity between thedroplets and SC-CO 2and increasing the SC-CO2/vaccine sugar solution ratio [113]. Another critical issue in the drying process is the pH drop (final pH 2.5-3) due to thedissolution of CO 2in the water phase [113]. Since the structure of HA changes below a pH of approximately 5, it is essential to use a sufficiently buffered vaccine solution. In the second concept, the SC-CO2is dissolved at high pressure in the solution con- taining the vaccine compound and sugar and sprayed to atmospheric conditions. Uponspraying, the CO 2expands and droplets break up in smaller droplets, which are then dried by a flow of nitrogen. This process is a spray-drying process at relative low-tempe-rature (20-50\u00b0C, but usually somewhat above T c(32\u00b0C) [113]), using the SC-CO2as effer- vescent and extraction agent to enhance the atomization process and water transfer the-reby shortening the drying process.CHAPTER II 33Storage stability of dried influenza vaccines Although the drying process may give a stable vaccine, it does not guarantee long-term stability. In the dry state, the long-term stability of the influenza vaccine may still belimited, especially at elevated storage temperatures. The stability of the dried vaccine ismerely dependent on the formulation (composition), the structure in which the vaccineis incorporated in the formulation and, of course, the storage conditions. It should be rea-lized that even a successful drying process does not assure vaccine stability in the solidstate. Amorij et al. showed that the storage stability of lyophilized influenza subunit vac- cine was dependent on the type of carbohydrate, type of buffer and storage conditions[61]. Subunit vaccine lyophilized kD have beenshown to be stable for at least 26 weeks at room temperature. In contrast, vaccine incor-porated in a glassy matrix of dextran 56 kD lost its potency during storage for 26 weeks.When influenza subunit vaccine lyophilized with inulin 0.9 kD or 1.8 kD was stored at45\u00b0C, the potency of the vaccine was almost completely lost within 4 weeks. In contrast,when trehalose was used as stabilizer the subunit vaccine retained its potency at thistemperature for at least 26 weeks. The poor stabilization of HA by dextran might be dueto phase separation (during freezing) and/or the bulkiness of dextran (steric hindrance),preventing efficient hydrogen bonding with the protein [65, 95, 115]. This in contrast tothe small disaccharide trehalose. The less efficient stabilization of HA at elevated tempe-ratures by the oligosaccharide inulin compared to trehalose might be due to a lowerextent and intimacy of hydrogen bond formation [95]. In the study of Amorij it was also found that HBS was superior to PBS to preserve the in vitro immunological properties of HA in the carbohydrate formulation upon freeze-drying and storage. The antigen activity of the powders decreased more readilywhen PBS was used instead of HBS. Reasons for this could be an improper inclusion inthe glassy matrix due to the pH shift during freezing with PBS and the capability of HBSto form an amorphous matrix [75] that acts as a stabilizer during freeze-drying and storage. Maa et al evaluated the stability of trivalent influenza subunit powder (containing A/Panama(H3N2), A/New Caledonia(H1N1) and B/Yamanashi strains) produced byspray-freeze drying using concentrated feed solutions (35.64 mg HA/ml and35%w/v carbohydrate) [85]. Vaccine formulations of different were stability: - A: for 12 weeks at 40\u00b0C in sealed glass vials, formulation A and B possessed unchanged HA potency whereas formulation C suffered continuous potency 34loss. This might be due to decrease of the Tgby poloxamer. Although the HA potency was unaffected, formulation B lost its uniform particle properties (shape/flowability)during storage due to crystallization of arginine glutamate. In an additional study formu-lation A was found to be resistant to humidities of 10 and 40 % relative humidity (RH)for 8 weeks at 40\u00b0C, but gradually lost potency upon storage at 75% RH. The WIV vaccine powder stabilized with trehalose (trehalose/virus, 500:1) as produced by Huang et al. showed improved stability compared to liquid WIV vaccine[91]. While the liquid formulation lost more than 50% of its haemagglutination activityupon storage for 2 weeks at 4\u00b0C/25% RH and 25\u00b0C/25% RH the powder formulationretained full haemagglutination activity up to 12 weeks. However, the powder formu-lation showed an almost instant drop in stability upon storage at 40\u00b0C/75% RH. This wasprobably due to crystallization of trehalose resulting from a decrease in T g by the high humidity (Tg(trehalose+water) < 40\u00b0C) resulting in an increase in molecular mobility [69]. Inulin sugar glasses have been shown to preserve the structural integrity and bio- logical activity of influenza virosomes during storage storage at the inulin lyophilized virosomes gradually decrea-sed in HA potency, but to extent than the virosomes lyophilized without sugar.Moreover, virosome aggregation was observedwhen virosomes were lyophilized without sugar, but did not occur when they werelyophilized with inulin. The preservation of the vesicular structure in the presence ofsugars, in particular inulin is believed to be related to the fact that the oligosaccharideinteracts with membrane lipids and as such may preserve the structural and functionalfeatures of membrane vesicles during dehydration [71, 116, 117]. Although only limited research has been done on the storage stability of different influenza vaccine types an interesting trend can be noticed. The most successful sta-bilization studies have been performed with subunit preparations, which are relativelystable even at elevated temperatures (40\u00b0C). In contrast, WIV and virosomes incorpora-ted in a glassy sugar matrix showed to be less stable at comparable conditions. The maindifference between subunit (and split) vaccine compared to WIV and virosomes is thevesicular structure consisting of lipids, which may explain the less efficient stabilizationof the WIV and virosomes. Lipids have a melting point (T m) above which they are in the liquid crystalline phase; below this Tmthey are in the gel phase. In the hydrated state, for example the Tm for POPC (1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is about -1\u00b0C and rises toabout 70\u00b0C when it is dried without sugars [118]. This is due to increase in Van der Waalforces between lipids upon removal of water molecules from the lipid headgroup region.As a result the bilayer undergoes a phase transition during rehydration, which may leadto disturbance of the vesicle (Fig. 11). However, certain carbohydrates can prevent thisphase transition, according to the water replacement hypothesis formulated by Crow etal. [73]. Carbohydrates containing many hydroxyl-groups can take over hydrogen bon-ding to a certain extent, thereby forcing themselves in between the lipid headgroups.This results in more space between the lipid molecules and reduction in Van der WaalsCHAPTER II 35Fig. 11 Water replacement hypothesis for lipid bilayers. The diagram shows how trehalose is thought to stabilize dry lipid bilayers (adopted from Crowe et al. [73]). 36forces, leading to lower phase transition temperatures. For example, the Tmfor POPC in the dry state in the presence of trehalose is lowered to -20\u00b0C [118]. In addition carbohy-drates that vitrify in between the bilayers (form glasses) tend to keep the membrane inthe phase it was at the moment of vitrification [119-121] and prevent aggregation/fusiondue to particle isolation [82]. oligosaccharides like trehalose and inulin, respectively, are capa- ble of stabilizing lipid bilayers, when present on both sides of the lipid bilayer [73, 116-118, 120]. However, in the studies performed on stabilization of WIV and virosomes nosugar was inside the vaccine particle giving the change of (partial) reorganization of thelipids and subsequent phase transitions. As a result WIV and virosomes incorporated insugar glasses might have a reduced shelf-life compared to sugar glass incorporated forms In this section, various needle-free delivery systems for influenza vaccines will be discus- sed. The development of most needle-free dosage forms are approached with use ofliquid influenza vaccines. In addition to the stability increase of dried vaccine formula-tions, the development of certain needle-free dosage forms requires the use of a dry-powder vaccine formulation. A dry vaccine powder for needle-free delivery can be idealfor several reasons. However, thus far the application of dry-powder vaccine in needle-free delivery technologies is limited. Therefore also needle-free delivery technologiesbased on liquid vaccine forms are discussed in this review. The needle-free delivery of vaccines can be divided by the route of administration: viathe skin (intradermal or transcutaneous) and via mucosal routes (nasal, pulmonary, oralcavity and oral). Each of these routes has their own advantages/disadvantages related tothe ease of vaccination and the type of immune response elicited. Epidermal and transcutaneous immunization Until recently, the skin was considered as a barrier through which vaccines could not be delivered. Currently, however, the skin is seen as a highly immune competent organbeing suitable for vaccine delivery by transcutaneous or epidermal immunization. Theskin is divided into three layers: the stratum corneum consisting of cornified keratinocy-tes, the epidermis consisting of live keratinocytes and an extensive network of immunecells; and the underlying dermis, which supports the epidermis with blood vessels, lym-phatics and other structures. The primary antigen-presenting cell (APC) type found inthe epidermis, the DC. APCs covering about 25% of the dermal [122]. Upon encountering anantigen in the skin, epidermal Langerhans cells take the antigen up, migrate to a draininglymph node and induce a systemic immune response [123]. In addition activatedLangerhans cells produce cytokines that induce strong antigen-specific responses by B-and T-lymphocytes. Epidermal and transcutaneous immunization with influenza vacci-nes has also been shown to elicit mucosal immune responses (both IgG and IgA) at mul-tiple sites including the lungs and nasal cavity [84, 124, 125]. This is of particular impor-tance since antibodies at these sites give rise to protection at the port of entry of theinfluenza virus. Penetration of the stratum corneum Under normal circumstances, the stratum corneum acts as an effective barrier to thepenetration of foreign molecules. From literature it is evident that transdermal deliveryof most drugs and bioactive molecules larger than 500 Da to the blood vessels in the der-mis is not possible by diffusion and that delivery beyond the skin with needles is nee-ded. However, vaccine antigens merely require delivery to the more superficial epider-mis. So with merely penetration of the stratum corneum (recombinant) antigens as largeas 1 mD are capable to reach the epidermis and elicit immune responses [126].CHAPTER II 37Jet injectors One method to deliver vaccine is needle-free injection by delivery to epidermal (but also deeper subcutaneous or intramuscular) tissue using jet injectors. This method is especi-ally suitable for mass vaccination. Although the older multi-use nozzle jet injectors wereassociated with rare inadvertent transmission infections, jet injectors, Systems, Tustin, CA), are approved by the FDA[127]. These devices have the same efficacy as the traditional influenza vaccinationmethod with needle and syringe [128] and make use of liquid vaccine. Recently a pow-der jet injector, PowderJect (PowderJect Pharmaceuticals PLC, Oxford, UK), has beendeveloped to deliver powder particles in the epidermis [129]. When the device is acti-vated one dose vaccine powder is accelerated to such a speed that the particles perforatethe stratum corneum and thus reach the epidermis [88]. Powders for epidermal immu-nization have been made by both desiccation/grinding/sieving and spray-freeze drying.Important factors for the design of these powders were a high particle density and a par-ticle size of 20-70 m for effective penetration to the epidermis [130]. Animal studies in mice have demonstrated that epidermal powder immunization with a PowderJect device induces both antibody responses and protective immunityagainst homologous and heterologous challenge [88, 89]. In addition, upon co-admini-stration of adjuvant (like CTB and LT-mutants with reduced toxicity) a significantlylower dose of influenza vaccine was required to induce the same antibody response inboth mice and monkeys when compared with conventional i.m. injection [84, 89]. In a phase I clinical trial conducted by Dean et al. it was found that a powdered tri- valent influenza vaccine (as designed in: [85]) delivered by epidermal powder immuni-zation using the PowderJect ND5.2 delivery system (Fig. 12) is safe and elicits humoralimmune responses in humans [131]. This phase I clinical trial showed that seroconver-sion (75-100%) and geometric mean titers were equivalent or higher in epidermal pow-der immunized groups than in groups who received the vaccine by normal liquid injec-tion. However, since only studies with limited numbers of subjects have been performedmore data and clinical trials are needed to prove the efficacy and safety of this method. Patches Another method to deliver antigens into the skin is transcutaneous immunization ortopical immunization using patches. In transcutaneous immunization penetration of thestratum corneum is facilitated by means of hydration and/or mechanical disruption.Hydration by occlusion or wetting the skin results in swelling of keratinocytes and poo-ling of fluid in the intracellular spaces, which allows antigens to pass through the stra-tum corneum more easily [123]. Glenn et al. demonstrated the concept of transcutane-ous immunization with a wet patch in humans. In a phase I trial vaccination of volun-teers with wet gauze containing E.Coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) under an adhesive patch resulted in robust LT-antibody responses [132]. Topical delivery has also been facilitated by physical means of skin disruption such as abrasion, tape stripping or electroporation [7].

Powdered vaccine is housed in the cassette between polycarbonate membra-nes. After actuation the release of helium from the ruptures the membranes of the vaccine cas-sette and propels the vaccine particles from the cassette through the nozzle. The particles are acceleratedto high velocity with enough force to penetrate the epidermal layer of the skin.

Ina similar mouse study, transcutaneous immunization with WIV after mechanical skindisruption induced immune responses that protected against challenge [125]. In the samestudy, it was found that the penetration enhancers/immunomodulators, i.e. oleic acidand retinoic acid, enhanced protection and differentially affected the pattern of cyto-kine production upon stimulation with WIV. Recently, a novel patch delivery technology, PassPortTMSystem, showed to be sui- table for transcutaneous immunization [133]. The system consists of an array of metallicfilaments, that creates 80 micropores within 1 cm 2area by thermal energy, which is covered with a vaccine reservoir patch. The patch system loaded with a recombinant H5haemagglutinin vaccine formulation was used for transcutaneous immunization via theabdominal skin of mice. This immunization induced protective immunity against chal-lenge with an H5N1 virus. In a clinical study it was evaluated whether transcutaneous immunization with a non-replicative adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine expressing HA could induce animmune response [134]. The abdominal skin was pretreated by shaving with a razor andsubsequently 30 strokes with a toothbrush. The vaccine applied to the pretreated abdo-minal skin of healthy adults induced serum antibodies, but the responses were lowerthan those induced by intranasal administration. Besides the use for direct vaccination with antigen, patches have also been applied to stimulate or modulate the immune response of subcutaneous or intramuscularly admi-nistered influenza vaccines [123, 135-137]. An immunostimulant LT containing patchimproved the immune response to influenza vaccination in the elderly [137]. Elderlyreceived an i.m. injection with virosomal influenza vaccine proximal to a LT-containingpatch applied at skin which was disrupted by emery paper (after hydration). The reci-CHAPTER II 39pients of the LT-immunostimulating patch (IS patch, IOMAI) showed improved sero- conversion and seroprotection compared to elderly receiving vaccine alone. Microneedles Besides the use for i.m. injection, traditional needles also have been used for penetrationof the skin to allow delivery into the dermis for a variety of vaccines [138]. Recently thisapproach has been shown to improve the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines and toallow reduction to 20% of the administered dose [139-141]. Special designed(micro)needles allow a controlled depth of penetration of the skin (painless), and havebeen found suitable for intradermal vaccination with influenza vaccines in preclinicalstudies [142]. Although this concept of targeting to the Langerhans cells showed attrac-tive results, there are (technical) challenges to ensure successful delivery into the appro-priate intradermal site. In contrast to the use of one single needle, systems composed of arrays of pointed microneedles (as short as 25 m) have been developed that can penetrate the stratum corneum. These arrays are designed to target Langerhans cells in the epidermis, but donot reach the nerves in the underlying tissue [143]. As a result these microneedle arraysinduce minimal sensation and no pain as shown in preliminary clinical studies [144]. Anadditional advantage is the ease of administration, since these patches can be applied bypersons with minimal medical training [7]. Recently, a micro-projection array has beenused for the topical application of a recombinant anthrax antigen in rabbits and providedcomplete protection against inhalation challenge [145]. Recently micro-projection arrays have been developed to deliver solid antigens [147, 148]. A simple controllable method can be used to coat microneedles (Fig. 13) withdrugs, proteins, DNA, viruses and microparticles for delivery into the skin [146]. Tworecent studies have evaluated the ability of microneedles to deliver solid state vaccinesinto the skin of hairless guinea pigs. In the first, microneedles of a micro-projection arraysystem coated with a dry film of ovalbumin antigen penetrated the skin to an averagedepth of 100 m which resulted in antibody responses [147]. In an additional study it was shown that by adjustment of the array architecture and antigen coating procedure, thepenetration and amount of antigen delivered can be controlled [146]. The microneedlearray was coated with ovalbumin 2-20% ovalbumin,30-48% sucrose and 20. An overall delivery efficiency of 48-58% anti-gen could be reached using microneedles of 225-600 m. Moreover, when the immune response elicited by i.m. injection was compared to that of a microneedle array on theskin, the microneedle array technology demonstrated significantly higher antibody titersagainst ovalbumin. This technology might be applicable to deliver an influenza vaccineinto the skin by a dry, sugar-glass-stabilized, microneedle array patch. 40Fig. 13 Out-of-plane microneedle array uniformly coated with model-vaccin (colored yellow).

The surfaces of the body are highly immunologic organs, which perform constant surveillance for foreign antigens. As a result all mucosal surfaces including nasal, pulmo-nary, oral, rectal and vaginal mucosa are considered as potential sites for vaccination.However, most research focus on nasal, pulmonary and oral delivery due to practical rea-sons and/or expected lack of cultural acceptance of rectal and vaginal delivery. The mucosal immune system The mucosal membranes are the port of entry and main site of infection for most patho-gens and several mechanisms protect these surfaces from pathogens. Mucus forms a phy-sical barrier and different enzymes kill or inhibit the growth of pathogens. Moreover,mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) protects the mucosa by discriminatingbetween harmless antigens (e.g. food) and pathogens. MALT is situated along the muco-sa of the nose, lungs and gastrointestinal tracts and includes tissue patches), respectively. After invasion of pathogens via inhalation, ingestion or sexual contact the mucosal immune system is stimulated at the mucosal inductive sites (also known as IgA induc-tive sites) by uptake of antigens through a unique set of antigen-sampling cells. Thesemicrofold cells (M-cells) are located on mucosal surfaces overlying the MALT. After suc-cessful uptake at the inductive site, the antigens are immediately processed and presen-ted by macrophages and DCs resulting in the development of effector and memory B andT cells. These antigen-specific B and T cell populations than migrate from the inductivesite via lymphatic drainage, circulate through the bloodstream and most of them returnto the area from which they originated. However a part of the antigen-specific B and Tcell populations home to distant mucosal effector sites including the lamina propriaregions of the respiratory, intestinal and reproductive tracts [149-151]. At the originaltissues and the more diffuse mucosal tissues, antigen-specific IgA-committed B, Th1 andTh2 cells interact resulting in generation of IgA at the mucosal site. Consequently, secre-CHAPTER II 41ted IgA acts as the first line of protection at mucosal surfaces. It is generally assumed that IgA is the main antibody isotype and effector molecule in host defense at mucosal surfa-ces [152]. In addition to the elicited mucosal responses, parts of the systemic immune respon- se cascade can be stimulated, including the production of serum antibodies, lymphocyteproliferation, cytokine production and CTL activity, thereby providing protectionagainst systemic infection upon the next challenge. Mucosal immunity at the port of entry of influenza In humans, the primary targets for influenza virus are the mucosa in the upper and lowerrespiratory tract. After infection with influenza virus, the immune system reacts to repli-cation of the virus in the respiratory tract by both innate and adaptive immune respon-ses. Antibody and T cell responses are triggered against epitopes located on the virusenvelope such as HA [153]. The antibodies at the mucosal tissues, locally produced IgAand IgG transudated from serum, together with local IgA-committed maygive rise to mucosal immunity [4]. This mucosal immunity in the (upper) respiratorytract is of major importance as it provides the first line of defense against homologousvirus [25] and possibly also drift virus variants [154-158]. Most currently marketed vaccines are administered by i.m. or s.c. injection by which protective immunity in the systemic compartment is induced. In addition, virus-neutralizing antibodies from the circulation can protect against severe pneumonia as aresult of transudation from the blood into the lungs [34, 35]. However, these vaccines failto stimulate the mucosal immune system of the respiratory tract, the main port of entryfor influenza virus, which provides the first line of defense against infection [4, 159-162].Especially secretion of mucosal IgA in the nose (upper respiratory tract) is desired, as itmay prevent infection by incoming viruses. Induction of nasal immunity might improvethe efficacy of current (parenterally delivered) vaccines and protect against infection atthe site of invasion. Mucosal vaccines Induction of mucosal immunity generally requires direct application of vaccine to themucosal surface for stimulation of the specific local immune mechanisms of the MALT.Mucosal influenza vaccines aim at the induction of mucosal, systemic humoral as well ascell-mediated immune responses. A mucosal influenza vaccine could be ideal for sever-al reasons. First mucosal influenza vaccines may provide several potential advantages,such as eliminated pain at the injection site, easier and faster vaccine distribution andadministration, and reduced costs [6, 7, 163]. Moreover, mucosal vaccination can resultin a mucosal immune response in the respiratory tract, which might give protectionagainst influenza infection at the port of entry. Finally, since mucosal IgA responses havebeen shown to exhibit cross-protective immunity against antigenically distinct viruses[154, 157], such a mucosal immune response induced by mucosal vaccination might offerbroader protection against drifted, heterologous strains. 42Nasal delivery Until now vaccination via the intranasal route (i.n.), targeting the NALT, is the only mucosal route that has been successfully applied for influenza vaccines. Today the onlyintranasal vaccine in the market is a live cold-adapted trivalent influenza intranasal vac-cine approved by the FDA in 2003 (Flumist). This vaccine is used in healthy personsfrom 5 to 49 years and administered via a pre-filled single use device that sprays vaccineinto the nostrils. Flumist has shown to induce both mucosal and systemic immunity inhumans. However, this vaccine induces lower serum antibodies than conventionalparenteral inactivated vaccines [28, 54]. A disadvantage of live cold-adapted influenza vaccines is that there are a number of (hypothetical) safety concerns, e.g. their safety is undetermined in immunocompromi-sed patients, the attenuated vaccine strain may reassort with other influenza viruses, pos-sible risk of vaccine-induced central nervous system complication [54]. The use of inac-tivated intranasal vaccines may be an alternative which combines the convenience ofintranasal administration and the safety of inactivated intramuscular vaccine [54]. A disadvantage of intranasally delivered pure influenza antigens (HA + NA) is that they are poorly immunogenic without the use of special delivery systems and/or muco-sal adjuvants [164]. Therefore, in recent preclinical and clinical studies investigators ex-amined the suitability of a number of candidate vaccines which are adjuvanted or spe-cially formulated. The most widely used mucosal adjuvants in animal studies are chole-ra toxin (CT) from Vibrio Cholerae and the closely related E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). These toxins consist of a pentameric B subunit oligomer linked to a single A sub-unit. In particular the A subunit is associated with both toxicity and adjuvant effects. Thetoxins increase permeability of the epithelium, leading to enhanced uptake and presen-tation of co-administered antigen, promotion of isotype differentiation in B cells leadingto an increased IgA formation and complex stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects onT-cell proliferation and cytokine production [10]. The adjuvant effect occurs only whenCT or LT is administered simultaneously with an antigen and by the same route [165].Although LT and CT are closely related molecules, important differences exist in theadjuvant effects that they exhibit. Use of CT as an adjuvant generally results in the induc-tion of antigen-specific Th2 cytokine Enterotoxins have been applied for nasal vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccines. In preclinical and clinical trials LT has been shown to improve the immune res-ponse of subunit vaccines NasalFlu \u00ae(Berna, Switzerland), a nasal virosomal vaccine containing LT was approved in Switzerland [168, 169]. However, soon afterintroduction this vaccine had to be withdrawn due to serious side effects [29]. Duringpost marketing surveillance, an association between the nasal vaccine and Bell's palsy, anadverse neurological event, was found [170]. It has been suggested that LT was redirec-ted into the brain resulting in the involvement of the central nervous system in Bell'spalsy [171, 172]. Since CT and LT are considered to be toxic for humans, non-toxic variants of CT andCHAPTER II 43LT are currently in development [10]. Isolated B subunits of CT and LT (CTB and LTB) have been explored for their ability to augment immune responses against co-administe-red antigens [173-176]. Although, their capacity as mucosal adjuvants was much lessthan that of holotoxins [10], some studies showed that addition of detoxified forms of LTcould improve the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine upon nasal vaccination withvaccine alone [155, 177] or in combination with a novel biovector (a nanoparticulate bio-adhesive delivery system with a positively charged polysaccharide core enclosed by aphospholipid-cholesterol double layer) [178]. In addition to the use of toxins, other approaches for nasal vaccination involve the that a single intranasal immunization of mice withinactivated influenza virus and -galactosylceramide induces long-term immunity that gives protection against challenge with live influenza virus. In addition, -galactosyl- ceramide did not redirect antigens (both WIV and ovalbumin) into the brain as revealedby tracking studies using antigens labeled with the chemoluminescent-tag Acridium[180]. Intranasal administration of proteasomes containing HA and purified outer mem-brane proteins extracted from N. Meningitidis have been shown to be well tolerated in adults and capable to induce both nasal IgA as well as serum antibodies [181]. Coulter etal. showed that it may be possible to induce effective immunity to influenza usingISCOMs intranasally [182]. ISCOM complexes are 40 nm cage-like upfrom subunits formed by the interaction of Quil-A with cholesterol. By addition of phos-pholipids, hydrophobic and amphiphilic antigens can be incorporated into ISCOMs byhydrophobic interactions during the assembly of the subunits [183]. In mice and sheepintranasal delivery of inactivated influenza vaccine mixed with ISCOMATRIX \u00ae(empty ISCOM) adjuvant, was able to induce serum HI titers higher than those obtained withnon-adjuvanted vaccine delivered subcutaneously. Furthermore, the ISCOMATRIX \u00ae adjuvanted vaccine delivered intranasally induced mucosal IgA responses in the lung andnasal passages. Various studies have been performed using chitosan or chitosan deriva-tives, a vaccine[184-187]. Chitosan is supposed to have mucoadhesive properties enhancing the resi-dence time in the nose and enhance the penetration capacity across mucosal barriers[188]. The use of such mucoadhesive polymers in nasal dosage forms that increase theresidence time within the nasal cavity provides the opportunity for sustained nasal drugdelivery [188]. In addition, nanoparticulate dispersions based on believed totarget the lymphoid tissue by the M-cells, resulting in an appropriate immune response[186, 189]. In clinical trials it was shown that sufficient seroprotection and serocon-version rates are possible by nasally vaccination with a combination of chitosan and tri-valent inactivated influenza [184, 187]. Although many adjuvants showed in some casespromising results there is still a search for new, improved and safe adjuvants. Besides liquid formulations, also powders have been developed for nasal delivery of vaccines [92, 190-192]. In addition to the fact that powders offer the advantage of impro-ved vaccine stability [7, 193], certain powder formulations also have demonstrated in-creased residence time in the nasal cavity compared with liquid [194, 195], which may 44translate into higher bioavailability and immune responses. Scintigraphic evaluation in rabbits of nasal drug delivery systems based on carbopol 971p and carboxymethylcellu-lose showed increased residence times upon addition of these mucoadhesive polymers[196]. A range of devices have been developed for intranasal delivery of powders [190]. A prototype system for delivery of a lyophilized powder has been described that offers theadvantage that a powder can be metered as a liquid and lyophilized directly in the de-vice [197]. When particles larger than 50 m are used, intranasally delivery is highly reproducible and independent of the vaccinee's control of breathing, because depositionis governed by inertial impaction [198]. However, due to nasal anatomy and physiology,with a non-ciliated area in the anterior part of the nasal cavity and a ciliated region inthe more posterior part of the nose, the site of deposition is of importance in view ofmucociliary clearance of a formulation from the nose. In a study of Tafaghodi et al. it wasshown that the limiting step for nasal clearance of particulate systems is their disloca-tion from the initial site of deposition [199]. The site of deposition depends on severalparameters which are related to the delivery device and formulation, such as velocity ofthe delivered particles and particle size of the formulation [197]. Therefore, the rightcombination of formulation (particle characteristics) and delivery device is important todeposit the particles at the desired location. A few studies report the development of dry-powder vaccine formulations for intra- nasal delivery. However, dry-powder formulations for intranasal delivery conductedthus far could only elicit a sufficient immune response when they were co-formulatedwith a mucoadhesive polymer or mucosal adjuvant [91]. Huang et al. described an intra-nasal powder formulation of WIV and a novel intranasal delivery device. A dry-powderof WIV and trehalose was prepared by lyophilization and the lyophilized cake was re-duced to sizes suitable for nasal delivery. The final dry-powder formulation consisted ofvaccine powder and a mucoadhesive compound in the size range of 45 to 125 m [92]. The powder-formulated vaccine, elicited a significant serum antibody response in ratsthat was at least as strong as that provided by the liquid vaccine administered intranasal-ly or via i.m. injection. Moreover, significant nasal IgA responses were observed afterintranasal delivery [91]. Pulmonary delivery Pulmonary delivery of influenza vaccine is a potential alternative for today's influenzavaccination. The lungs are highly vascularized, have a large absorptive surface area [101,107, 190, 200] and contain BALT [9]. Furthermore, local APCs like different types ofmacrophages and DCs are ideally located for antigen sampling and subsequent presenta-tion to T cells [201-203]. As a result, the combination of the unique anatomical/physio-logical features of the lungs and the possibility to expose a relative large mucosal surfaceto vaccine facilitates an effective uptake of antigen by many different types of APCs.Therefore, pulmonary delivery of an influenza vaccine is an interesting strategy. In addi-tion, pulmonary immunization by targeting the BALT can offer the advantage of indu-cing both systemic immunity as well as local immunity in the respiratory tract [151].CHAPTER II 45Pulmonary delivery of vaccines against measles has been extensively investigated. The effectiveness of measles vaccination by inhalation has been shown in a number ofclinical studies, with pioneering studies performed already in the 1960s [204]. Severalclinical studies have shown that attenuated measles vaccines administered by inhalationwere at least as effective as vaccine given via the conventional parenteral route [205]. Pulmonary delivery of vaccines against influenza has already been investigated in a number of older clinical studies. Although most of the studies lack efficient targeting ofsolely the lungs, some general trends can be seen. The research group of Waldman eva-luated aerosol immunization with a classical inactivated influenza vaccine [206-208].The vaccine was sprayed into the posterior oropharynx during rapid, deep inspirationfollowed by spraying 0.125 ml liquid vaccine into each nostril, with the use of an atomi-zer which emits droplets ranging in size from 1 to 100 m. In one of their studies, these influenza vaccine aerosols gave a lower over-all protection rate compared to injectionadministration [206]. A booster dose, however, seemed to have a marked effect. In follow-up studies it was shown that respiratory immunization prevented illness in humans [209]. In addition, aerosol immunization in humans with inactivated influ-enza vaccine induced higher levels of respiratory secretion antibody than subcutaneousimmunization [207, 210]. Interestingly, these respiratory antibodies were also morecross-reactive with heterologous viruses [211]. The efficacy of influenza immunization by inhalation is further supported by stu- dies of Haigh et al. [212, 213]. A group of volunteers who WIV by inhalationusing a pressurized metered dose inhaler (361 subjects) had the same incidence of influ-enza illness compared to the group receiving WIV by hypojet gun (706 subjects), whichwas significantly lower than the incidence in the control group (361 subjects) [213]. Thisresult was confirmed in another study performed by Waldman et al. [214]. A further cli-nical study showed that inhaled inactivated vaccine can provide protection against aheterologous variant [212]. The incidence of influenza-related sickness was assessed in1007 male subjects immunized by inhaled inactivated vaccine and 1007 unimmunizedsubjects. The vaccine contained A2/Aichi/68 whereas the circulating virus was exclu-sively A/England/42/72. The protection rate of the trial was 47% as opposed to approxi-mately 60% in previous trials using the same vaccine but in which no variant was knownto have been encountered. These results confirm that cross-reactivity of the respiratoryantibodies elicited by inhaled influenza can be achieved. Recently, the pulmonary route has been re-explored for vaccination against influ- enza in various pre-clinical studies. A comparison between pulmonary immunization(intratracheal) with nasal immunization using WIV and influenza subunit vaccine show-ed that pulmonary immunization was more effective in inducing local and systemicimmune responses [11]. A more recent study by Minne et al. assessed the impact of anti-gen distribution within the respiratory tract on the immune response to a monovalentinfluenza split virus vaccine administered to mice that were previously intranasally pri-med with WIV [215]. By variation of the administration technique the liquid vaccinewas targeted to different sites of the mouse respiratory tract, i.e. the nasal cavity, theupper or central airways, or the deep lungs. Delivery of the vaccine to the different res- 46piratory regions generated systemic, mucosal (local) humoral and cellular virus-specific immune responses which increased upon increasing the depth of vaccine deposition.Deep-lung vaccination resulted in systemic neutralizing antibodies similar to intra-muscular vaccination. In addition, immunization via the deep-lung in stead of i.m. resul-ted in Th1 skewing of the cellular immune response. Minne et al. explained the higherefficacy of deep-lung vaccination by the prolonged residence time of the vaccine in thelungs. A few studies report the development of dry-powder vaccine formulations for pul- monary delivery of influenza vaccine. A spray-dried lipid formulation containing WIVor split influenza vaccine has been evaluated for mucosal vaccination via the pulmonarytract. The inhalation powder contained the APCs andenhancing antigen release, respectively [11]. Pulmonary delivery of the powders contai-ning WIV in naive rats induced substantial systemic immune responses, but no mucosalIgA in the respiratory tract. In contrast to microparticles containing WIV, microparticlescontaining the subunit vaccine powder showed enhanced serum antibody levels uponpulmonary delivery that were even higher than those induced by i.m. vaccination. Recently, pulmonary vaccination with a new influenza subunit vaccine powder was evaluated in mice [216]. Vaccine powder was produced by spray-freeze drying (SFD)using inulin as stabilizer. The powder possessed a large particle size distribution in orderto target both central and deeper lungs. Pulmonary vaccination of mice with the vac-cine powder induced mucosal, systemic humoral as well as cell-mediated immune res-ponses. These responses were superior to those elicited by conventional i.m. vaccinationor pulmonary vaccination with a liquid aerosolized subunit vaccine. The superiority ofthe SFD vaccine powder compared to the aerosolized liquid subunit vaccine can beexplained by: - the lower respiratory tract deposition of the powder and resulting increased residence time in the lungs, - the inulin may increase viscosity at the site of deposition which increases the residence time, and - the solid inulin may have an adjuvant effect. The adjuvant activity of inulin was mentioned in several papers [217-219]. In these publications it was explicitly the inulin gamma-crystal that was assigned to have adju-vant activity. However, in the system used by Amorij et al. [216] amorphous inulin par-ticles were used. In addition alveolar deposition, lacks mucociliair clearance, which mayhave resulted in an increased residence time of the vaccine [215]. From the studies described above it can be concluded that pulmonary immuniza- tion is a highly promising route for vaccination. Vaccination via the pulmonary route hasbeen shown to induce broad immune responses in preclinical studies. However, clinicaltrials are needed to prove the efficacy and safety of pulmonary vaccination in humans. These clinical trials should be performed using recently designed inhalers which guaran-tee high and reproducible lung deposition of the vaccine. There are three types of inha-CHAPTER II 47The use of dry-powder inhalers seems to be the most suitable option. First, dry- powder inhalation would overcome instability problems when a suitable stable dry-pow-der formulation is used [221, 222]. In addition, dry-powder inhalation would be prefer-red over of liquid aerosols, since dry-powder inhalation has been shownto be more reproducible and efficient. Furthermore, a dry-powder would provide theopportunity to design aerosols, particles, with the desired properties for inhalation toensure efficient targeting of the lung areas of interest. Some recently developed inhalersmight be suitable for vaccination purposes. For example De Boer et al. recently develo-ped a single-use disposable inhaler, the Twincer TM(Fig. 14), that combines low costs, good dispersion of high powder doses and good moisture protection of the powder for-mulation [223]. Oral delivery Oral delivery of influenza vaccines is an attractive mode of immunization because oraldosage forms are easy to administer and well accepted by the population. Orally delive-red vaccines aim at targeting the mucosal inductive site of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,the Payer's patches, appendix, solitary lymphoid nodules and 48Fig. 14 An of disposable TwincerTM. (DPIs). However, not all systems seem suitable for vaccination purposes. Nebulizersare associated with a time consuming administration, high drug losses and a very poordrug delivery to the respiratory tract and they use high shear stresses which can lead toprotein denaturation. MDIs utilize propellants (chlorofluorocarbons and increasinglyhydrofluoroalkane) and atomization of the vaccine solution. Vaccine compounds mightbecome susceptible to denaturation or degradation when they come into contact withthese propellants or with the large air-liquid interfaces during aerosolization. The use ofso-called \"soft mist inhalers\" might be an interesting strategy since they apply the con-cept of low-velocity aerosol in combination with the generation of aero-sols 220]. Moreover, in contrast to soft mist inha-lers can directly aerosolize the aqueous vaccine formulation without the use of propel-lants that may affect the integrity of the influenza vaccine [75]. However, next to the cli-nical trials in humans that are needed to prove efficacy, it will first have to be investi-gated whether the vaccine is resistant against the aerosolization.isolated lymphoid follicles. The surface of Payer's patches is covered follicle-associted epithelium (FAE) enriched with specialized antigen-sampling cells, microfold or mem-branous cells (M cells). These M cells are supposed to deliver intact antigen to the under-lying APC. After presentation of processed antigen by DCs, Th cells become Th1 and/orTh2 cells. These matured Th cells are subsequently responsible for the induction andregulation of antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity and IgA responses. Today, only a few vaccines are administered orally and most of them are based on live attenuated pathogens [6]. The most prominent oral vaccine is the Sabin oral poliovaccine, that was brought on the market in the early 1960s, and had an important rolein the program for global eradication of polio [6]. However, live vaccines have a theo-retical risk of virulence, and occasionally they have other undesired vaccine-related sideeffects. For example, the use of live attenuated polio vaccine was discontinued in theUnited States because of rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio and was replacedby inactivated poliovirus vaccine [6]. Until now no effective vaccine for oral influenza vaccination has been licensed. However, over the past decades, a number of clinical studies with oral influenza vac-cines have been performed. Moldoveanu et al. immunized healthy adults with 10 doses (total 150 g HA/strain) of trivalent split inactivated influenza vaccine on five consecutive mornings [90]. Toensure that the vaccine was delivered to the small intestine, the vaccine was air-driedwith D-xylose and packed into enteric-coated gelatin capsules. Following oral immuni-zation, serum antibodies of all isotypes were only slightly increased 21 days after in-gestion of the vaccine. However, in external secretions (saliva and nasal lavage), antigen-specific IgA and IgG responses were detected. In another study it was shown that oral immunization of 5 volunteers with enteric- coated alum-absorbed WIV vaccine on day 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 (6x4 g HA) resulted in a significant rise of IgA-specific antibodies in tears, saliva and nasal secretion [224]. Thesecretory antibody response was slow and reached a maximum 5-7 weeks after com-pletion of immunization. However, serum antibody titers were not increased. Oral immunization with split inactivated influenza vaccine formulated as an emul- sion was investigated in humans by Avtushenko et al. [225]. Volunteers were immuni-zed once or twice (at an interval of 14 days) with 140 g HA. Only after one oral admi- nistration the vaccine induced reliable increases in the level of secretory IgA in nasalsecretions and saliva of volunteers. After 2 immunizations however, this response wasnot found. The authors explained this remarkable effect with oral tolerance caused byrepeated ingestion of significant doses of antigen. It was concluded that the dose of anti-gen needs to be optimized to ensure a maximal and safe immune response. Although in most of the clinical studies relatively high doses of antigen were orally applied [86, 90, 225] in order to overcome limited absorption by M cells. These immuni-zations all resulted in IgG responses below detection level. In contrast, most studiesdemonstrate a significant increase in IgA antibodies in both saliva and nasal lavage fluids.It is unknown whether these IgA antibodies alone could provide adequate protectionagainst influenza infection in humans. Renegar et al. demonstrated in a preclinical studyCHAPTER II 49in pre-challenged mice that intranasal instillation of anti-influenza IgA but not anti-IgG or anti-IgM antiserum (for neutralization of the specific antibodies in the nasal secre-tions) could abrogate the immunity against re-challenge with influenza virus [226]. IgAwas the major (if not the sole) mediator that provided protection against nasal challengewith influenza virus. Moreover, influenza resistance of an organism has been shown todepend on the titer of secretory antibodies rather than on the titer of serum antibodies[154, 156, 157]. Therefore, sufficient protection might be achieved by mucosal IgA indu-ced by oral immunization. However, to our knowledge, no clinical study has beendesigned so far to reveal the level of protection provided by orally-induced local IgAimmune responses in humans. Regardless of the possibility to induce effective mucosal immune responses, influen- za vaccines have to evoke an adequate level of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the serumto fulfill current regulatory requirements for vaccine immunogenicity [29, 227]. In orderto achieve satisfying serum antibody levels current preclinical research on oral immuni-zation with influenza vaccines mainly focus on the use of adjuvants and complex vac-cine formulations. Studies in mice have demonstrated that live recombinant vaccines andWIV vaccines represent potentially promising oral vaccines [228, 229]. These oral vac-cines were co-formulated with adjuvants, and LT [175, 176, 230]. Besides theaddition of adjuvants, also more complex vaccine formulations have been developed[231, 232]. been demonstrated to improve an orally induced immune response directed againstinfluenza. However, as discussed before, there is still a need for new improved adjuvantsthat can safely be used in humans. A few studies on oral influenza vaccine development paid attention to the delivery site of the vaccine. Meitin et al. reported that intrajejunal administration of a live recom-binant vaccine virus consistently induced immunity in mice, while intragastric admini-stration was much less reliable in inducing this immune response [228]. Also for a sub-unit vaccine it was found that the delivery site within the gastro-intestinal tract had dif-ferent impacts on the immune response [238]. Moreover, co-administrating LT enhan-ced the immune responses in different ways. Intracolonic administration of vaccine withLT resulted in enhanced cellular immune responses and the desired Th1-skewing ofthese responses. Although intragastric administration of the adjuvanted vaccine also in-creased T-helper responses, no Th1-skewing was present. It was concluded that the rightcombination of a strong mucosal adjuvant and proper antigen delivery site within thegastro-intestinal tract might result in effective vaccination via the oral route. Until nowno clinical trials have been assessed to reveal the most optimal delivery site for vaccinein the gastro-intestinal tract. For these assessments tablets or capsules containing driedvaccine and supplied with special coatings that enable targeting to different GI-sites[239-242] should be developed. For example, Schellekens et al. developed a pH-control-led pulsatile delivery system in order to target specific sites in the gastro-intestinal tract[241, 242]. The pH-controlled pulsatile coatingmaterial wherein a swellable agent is embedded. This method may improve vaccines that 50are degraded and/or poorly immunogenic in the upper part of the GI-tract by specific pulsatile delivery to the colon, partly because of the lower levels of digestive enzymes ascompared with the small intestine. Oral-cavity delivery Delivery via the sublingual, buccal or gingival route, all aim at targeting the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the oral cavity. In comparison to the gastrointestinal tract,the oral cavity provides an environment that is almost free from acidity and proteaseactivity which reduces risks for degradation of the vaccine compound [243]. The oralcavity has a full complement of immune cells, both intra-epithelially and submucosally[244]. The lymphoid tissues in the oral cavity are like the nasopharyngeal tonsils part ofthe Waldeyer's ring (palatine, lingual tonsils and adenoids). Despite decades of worktowards understanding immune mechanisms in the blood and secondary lymphoid tis-sues, only limited information is available about the immunological processes within theoral cavity [245, 246]. In particular of the palatine and lingual tonsils inthe induction and contribution of specific antibody responses in humans is not clear[247]. In spite of this, the sublingual administration for allergen-specific immunotherapy has raised attention. This route was investigated in a number of clinical trials [248].These studies indicated that the oral cavity might be a suitable target site for vaccines totrigger the immune system. In addition tonsillar immunization of rabbits with killedCandida albicans has been shown to induce salivary antibodies [249]. Recently, oralspray immunization was evaluated in a phase I/II trial [250]. Healthy adult volunteerswere immunized four times at 1-week intervals with WIV, i.e. 4 x 90 g HA. The vac- cine was administered by a spray (100 l) into a wide open mouth using a conventional spray bottle. Although no significant increase in salivary IgA antibodies was found, theoral spray immunization induced serum HI antibodies in 75% of the volunteers alreadyafter 2 doses. A critical note with respect to this study is that the authors did not ensurethat no aerosol particles were inhaled. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that a part of thefound immune response is caused by pulmonary deposited WIV. However, delivery ofan influenza vaccine in the oral cavity, e.g. by sublingual or buccal tablets or patches,might be an interesting alternative route for vaccine delivery. In addition delivery in theoral cavity offers the opportunity to use mucosal adjuvants that are not yet suitable fornasal and/or pulmonary use.CHAPTER II 51Summary This paper reviews the perspectives of current influenza vaccines and its administration. Attention is given to the different influenza vaccine types used today, the rational andneed for stabilized influenza vaccines and strategies by which influenza vaccines can bestabilized. Furthermore the status of stabilized/solid influenza vaccines and the currentstatus of various needle-free dosage forms for influenza vaccination are reviewed. From the limited investigations performed so far it was concluded, that the integri- ty and stability of the dried vaccine depends on the type of vaccine, the used excipientsand the production (drying) process. However, more research is needed to get a com-plete understanding of the formulation and process design that provides successful vac-cine stabilization. Currently a variety of strategies that potentially may lead to needle-free dosage forms are under investigation. However, for most of these strategies a lot ofadditional (clinical) research is required before any definite statements on their useful-ness in man can be made. 52CHAPTER II of channel POPC 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine RH temperature of the maximal freeze- concentrated fraction Tmmelting temperature, melting point Teeutectic temperature vial monitorWHO World Health OrganizationWIV WHO. 2003.
