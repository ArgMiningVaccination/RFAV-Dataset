Tell tale signs are that in a world that is complicated and sometimes glum, you are always on the hunt for a glimpse of positivity. When it's raining, you're talking about tomorrow's weather report. When the news is too much to bear, you know to turn it off and take a walk in nature, and you surround yourself with like-minded people, creating a circle of optimists. If this is you, there is another tool for drawing positivity near and if this doesn't describe you, definitely read further because you might need this information more than you realize! Crystals each carry their own energy that is derived from the earth. Their vibrations can be harnessed even by beginners, drawing light and positivity to the steward of the stones. The good news is that there is no possibility of making mistakes and encouraging the opposite result of bringing negative energy out of the crystals as it does not exist. There is no negatively oriented stone as this is not part of the earth's natural phenomena. We are happy to share this primer on preparing stones, incorporating crystals into daily life and which we love specifically for bringing positive energy into your orbit. Crystals will come to you with their past energy from the time they were acquired and all of the hands that they have passed through to come to you. They will require a proper cleaning before you work with them (and it's a good idea to repeat the cleaning every so often to reattune them to your vibration). Cleansing can be done in several ways: Put the crystals in a salt water bath and allow them to be detoxified. You can also run the crystals under running water or clean them in the ocean or any moving body of water. Water in motion is an excellent way to cleanse crystals. You can leave the crystals outside under the light of a full moon for cleansing or bury them in the ground to reabsorb the earth's energy. Crystals can also be smudged. Lighting sage, Palo Santo or sandalwood and using the smoke to clean your stones is also an effective way to restore their charge. Once you have sufficiently cleansed your crystals, they are prepared for everyday use. There are many ways to include crystals in your day. Here are some of our favorite ways to integrate them: Use them as a part of your meditation and breathing practice. They can be placed on or around you, and the energy of your exercise will allure the energy of the stones to you. Light a candle as part of this sacred time you are taking for yourself. Create an altar with meaningful items and crystals and set your intentions in front of it during your day. It is an excellent way to begin or end a day. As you work or rest, place your crystals next to your drinking glass or glass water bottle. The stones will charge the water with their energy, and as you consume the water, so too will you imbibe the energy of the rocks. Place the crystals in your bed or under your pillow to absorb their vibrancy. And perhaps the way we like to use them best...with [luxury chocolates](https://www.vosgeschocolate.com/)!

So imagine pairing those benefits with crystals. Some of the crystals we love most for daily exercises to encourage positivity are listed here for you: Rose Quartz Ever since 7,000 B.C., people have turned to the rose quartz for its healing property. Some crystal healers would consider it a powerful healing crystal. However, it is the quartz crystal that is mostly associated with love; and there's no energy more positive than love. Lapis Lazuli It may not have healing properties, but the kind of positive energy one can derive from the lapis lazuli is mental clarity and enlightenment. It is also known for inducing a good mood, potentially leading to good vibes and happiness. Citrine This crystal radiates joy and positivity. It is a light maker that imparts wonder, delight and enthusiasm in the holder. It is also a brain stimulator that will raise self-esteem and self-confidence. Carnelian Of its many uses, perhaps the most important is Carnelian's ability to create a barrier against harmful emotions. It will ward off anger, sadness and resentment, while reigniting vitality and creativity. This vibrant and energetic stone stimulates oxygen flow and balance in its user. Amazonite This is a stone of regeneration, bringing calm and communication to those who keep it close. It can be used to treat fatigue and soothe and reduce stress. Crystals also help when you do energy healing exercises. Whether you are curious about the power of crystals or a practitioner of their energetic benefits, we invite you to explore them further, bringing your light and positivity into the world and adding to a collective of hope and good.
