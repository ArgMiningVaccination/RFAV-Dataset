Addressing co-occurring factors concurrently ensures the best opportunity for a satisfactory outcome. Treatment begins with patient and family education on the natural history of enuresis and practical behavioural guidance. Evidence to support particular interventions is limited, and children and families should be involved when choosing appropriate therapy. Enuresis alarms and desmopressin are treatment options when more active intervention is desired. Clinical refinements and combined treatment defined as discrete episodes of urinary incontinence during sleep in children aged 5 and older, and is commonly encountered in paediatric practice. For related definitions, see [Table 1](#Table 1). Enuresis represents delayed maturation in a normal developmental process that is typically achieved by age 5[ [1](#ref1)]-[ [4](#ref4)]). Specific contributing mechanisms include sleep arousal difficulties, with associated nocturnal polyuria, and relatively small bladder capacity[ [5](#ref5)]-[ [9](#ref9)]. The prevalence is 15% at age 5 years, 10% by age 7, and 5% by age 10[ [4](#ref4)]. Untreated enuresis has an estimated prevalence into adulthood of up to 2%. Family studies support strong genetic links[ [7](#ref7)][ [8](#ref8)][ [10](#ref10)][ [11](#ref11)]. Enuresis can have significant on child health and family life[ [12](#ref12)]-[ [15](#ref15)]. This revised position statement is based on a literature review of PubMed, the Cochrane database, Ovid, and Google Scholar, with focus on articles published since 2010. Leading clinical practice guidelines were identified from the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS)[ and the American Academy of Pediatrics guideline[ [8](#ref8)]. Meta-analyses and recent clinical trials were also integrated. [TABLE 1]. Enuresis-related definitions Incontinence Involuntary wetting at an inappropriate time and place in a child 5 years old. Incontinence includes both enuresis and daytime incontinence. In this statement, the term 'incontinence' applies to intermittent (not continuous) incontinence. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) A heterogeneous group indicator of LUTS Primary enuresis |Indicates a child who has never attained night-time bladder control| Secondary enuresis Indicates a child who has experienced a dry period of >6 months before enuresis. Often associated with a psychological or physical comorbidity Expected bladder capacity (EBC) (mL) Volume formula: 30 + (age (years) \u00d7 30) up to age 12. Adult EBC is approximately 400 mL <65% of EBC is consistent with small bladder capacity >130% of EBC overnight is consistent with nocturnal polyuria Based on references 1,3 1. enuresis requires active screening. Mild daytime lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common, affecting up to two-thirds of enuretic children. When present (i.e., in non-monosymptomatic enuresis), LUTS should be addressed first. Improvement in LUTS can improve enuresis secondarily. Conversely, enuresis treatment is less likely to succeed in the presence of unrecognized and untreated LUTS. Using a validated Canadian questionnaire can make screening more efficient[ [16](#ref16)]. Some LUTS, including urgency, frequency (8 times/day) and incontinence, suggest an overactive bladder, typically a functional condition[ [1](#ref1)]. Other LUTS, including dysuria (without urinary micturition, hesitation, holding manoeuvres, urinary infrequency (3 times/day), and the sensation of incomplete emptying, suggest dysfunctional voiding (the inability to relax pelvic floor muscles during micturition) or a lower urinary tract obstruction. When LUTS are severe, numerous, or atypical, urology consultation is appropriate[ [1](#ref1)][ [3](#ref3)][ [17](#ref17)]. To distinguish primary from secondary enuresis, inquire whether bedwetting has followed a 'dry' period of at least 6 months. Children with secondary enuresis should be screened for common organic comorbidities, less common medical conditions, and psychosocial stressors. When no clear precipitant is found, treatment recommendations for primary enuresis can be followed[ [1](#ref1)][ [10](#ref10)]. 2. Identify common Unrecognized constipation can cause both LUTS and enuresis and, if untreated, is associated with enuresis treatment failure. Constipation is often missed in school-aged children because parents are less aware of abnormal or infrequent bowel movements than in younger children. One recent study found that 82% of primary, simple enuretic children had constipation[ [18](#ref18)]. Treating constipation alone resolved enuresis in more than half the children affected[ [19](#ref19)], confirming the interplay between bladder and bowel function. Constipation management can be framed as \"bladder-friendly bowel health\"[ [20](#ref20)][ [21](#ref21)]. Family-friendly information on [healthy bowel habits](https://caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/healthy-living/healthy_bowel_habits) can found at the CPS Caring for Kids website. Developmental and psychiatric conditions: Children with delayed development may not have the maturation to remain dry at night. If enuresis symptoms are distressing for the child experiencing them and the family desires active therapy, treatment can be offered and tailored for the child's developmental age and stage. If a child has unrecognized and untreated attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), enuresis treatment is less likely to be successful[ [6](#ref6)]. Upper airway obstruction: Numerous studies have underlined the connections between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and enuresis, possibly related to sleep arousal. Treatment for OSA can help resolve enuresis[ [18](#ref18)]. 3. Consider less common medical conditions and psychosocial stressors Serious medical conditions do not usually present as primary or secondary enuresis. Rarely, however, incontinence during sleep can be a sign of diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus, renal disease, hyperthyroidism, spinal dysraphism, infections, seizure disorders, and cardiac arrhythmias[ [22](#ref22)]. Child maltreatment, trauma, and psychosocial stressors, including bullying, may also precipitate enuresis and should be considered. 4. Confirm enuresis details Frequency, severity, and impact of enuresis are key elements of the history. Children with monosymptomatic enuresis often have one large void early in the night. Children with subtle LUTS from overactive bladder may have a pattern of smaller, frequent voids through the night. Large quantities voided through the night suggest nocturnal polyuria, which has treatment implications. Enuresis that occurs every night is less likely to resolve spontaneously or respond to treatment than intermittent enuresis[ [6](#ref6)]. 5. Ask about fluid intake Inquire about the quantity and timing of fluid intake. Some children drink little during the day and have most of their liquids after school, which may contribute to nocturnal polyuria[ [23](#ref23)]. 6. Perform a complete physical examination Include growth parameters and examine for enlarged tonsils and signs of motor or sensory abnormality by inspecting the child's lumbosacral spine, lower limbs, and gait. Abdominal examination may suggest constipation. Genital examination and rectal palpation are optional and should be guided by patient comfort and history. Inspecting underwear may reveal urine or fecal incontinence. In most cases, the physical exam is normal. 7. Consider lab investigations, a voiding diary, and urine measurement Investigations are seldom necessary and should be limited to a urinalysis. Urinalysis is not needed when the clinician is confident diagnosing monosymptomatic primary enuresis[ [6](#ref6)]. Other studies (e.g., ultrasound) are rarely indicated[ [1](#ref1)][ [5](#ref5)][ [10](#ref10)]. A daily written voiding diary (see reference 10) or voiding diary app can be a useful tool for eliciting or clarifying symptoms (e.g., daytime LUTS) and monitoring response to treatment. Urine volume measurements can help inform treatment choices when assessing for: In primary monosymptomatic enuresis, the mainstay of management is education and reassurance that no treatment is necessary. Explain the natural history of enuresis, including the fact that virtually all children and adolescents will outgrow their bedwetting with time. Try to mitigate feelings of stigma or guilt. Emphasize that monosymptomatic enuresis is common, unintentional, and cannot be controlled either by positive incentives to 'stay dry' or negative consequences for bedwetting. Children who are not bothered by enuresis and whose self-esteem is intact, and families who are comfortable waiting for bedwetting to stop naturally, should be reassured that waiting is the recommended course of action. For children who are bothered by enuresis, and whose self-esteem is affected, and for families who are distressed by their child's bedwetting, education and reassurance is still the appropriate initial management. Many children and families, with appropriate counselling, can be reassured. For children and families experiencing ongoing distress after education and reassurance, behavioural and motivational counselling may help children and adolescents resolution[ [5](#ref5)][ [6](#ref6)][ [23](#ref23)][ [24](#ref24)]. Behavioural strategies include: Clinicians should help parents understand that when behavioural strategies do not work, it is neither their nor the child's fault[ [24](#ref24)], and that punishment is counterproductive. For children and families with persistent distress despite education and reassurance, shared decision-making with patients and families should inform the use of active therapies[ [5](#ref5)][ [6](#ref6)][ [8](#ref8)][ [10](#ref10)]. A transparent discussion of the risks, benefits, and likelihood of success associated with each active therapy is necessary, and spontaneous resolution should continue to be emphasized. Many children who find enuresis stressful, unpleasant, and a source of unhappiness respond positively to treatment[ [13](#ref13)], so long as treatment is implemented without blame or judgement. As with all conditions, active treatment for enuresis should be addressed with seriousness, compassion and flexibility[ [12](#ref12)]-[ [14](#ref14)][ [18](#ref18)]. Recognizing that older adolescents often experience more psychological distress associated with their enuresis as compared to younger children and youth, health care providers should approach these patients and families with seriousness and sensitivity. In addition to education and reassurance for these older adolescents, an earlier discussion of active therapies may be helpful. Importantly, for all children and youth, LUTS and identifiable comorbidities such as constipation need to be addressed before active intervention[ [5](#ref5)]. Used since the 1930s, the enuresis alarm wakes a sleeping child with a moisture sensor at the initial stage of voiding. Nightly use trains a child to associate the alarm with a full bladder and, eventually, the child may wake before voiding. Along with improved arousal, the alarm may also inhibit the micturition reflex, improve reservoir function, and even improve nocturnal polyuria in some children[ [20](#ref20)]. Alarm studies have demonstrated varying success rates (success being defined as 14 consecutive dry nights), typically with an initial response of 60% to 80%, although up to one-half of children may relapse when alarm use is discontinued[ [27](#ref27)]-[ [30](#ref30)]. Both international guidelines and clinical studies support re-treatment using alarm therapy following relapse[ [5](#ref5)], and evidence indicates that alarm therapy can work as a permanent cure in up to 50% of cases[ [18](#ref18)][ [27](#ref27)][ [31](#ref31)]-[ [35](#ref35)], compared per year[ [36](#ref36)][ [37](#ref37)]. Nightly enuresis is more resistant to alarm therapy, while infrequent enuresis (less than once per week) does not allow sufficient opportunity for appropriate training. At least two episodes per week should be baseline for alarm use to be effective[ [5](#ref5)][ [24](#ref24)]. Alarm therapy may be more effective in children with a normal or small bladder capacity than in those with nocturnal polyuria[ [38](#ref38)]. Newer alarms are available in both wearable and wireless options, and may offer additional features and enhanced comfort compared with older models. Treatment response can take time. Early signs of success include waking to the alarm without parental assistance, smaller volume enuretic voids, being able to urinate in the toilet after waking instead of emptying the bladder during sleep, and fewer enuresis episodes per night[ [23](#ref23)]. At the end of treatment, after consecutive dry nights and when the alarm is discontinued, higher evening fluid intake might help improve bladder conditioning[ [29](#ref29)][ [39](#ref39)][ [40](#ref40)]. However, caution is needed before considering such 'overlearning' as a therapeutic approach. In the presence of underlying overactive bladder or nocturnal polyuria, high fluid intake may cause increased urinary frequency and worsen bedwetting. The most common cause of failure is the child's inability to wake up to the alarm. Set expectations accordingly. Initially, parents will need to supervise alarm use: first to ensure it is attached correctly, then to wake the child when the alarm sounds (if the child does not wake themselves), and help them to the toilet and back to bed. Involvement can disrupt family sleep patterns and should be discussed with parents before initiating therapy. Even children younger than 8 years can share responsibility by placing the alarm on themselves, getting out of bed to void what is left in the bladder after waking to an alarm, changing from wet sleepwear into dry, and resetting the alarm when returning to bed. Some experts suggest that children quietly 'rehearse' the sequence of steps they will go through if the alarm sounds in the night[ [55](#ref55)] before getting into bed. Other causes of alarm failure include non-compliance, technical difficulties (incorrect use or continuous use of diapers while using the alarm), or not giving alarm therapy sufficient time to work. Alarm therapy is not appropriate for all patients and families, and dropout rates in clinical trials are approximately 30%[ [18](#ref18)][ [27](#ref27)]. Many families find alarm use too demanding of time and energy, and too disruptive to sleep routines. Physician encouragement can strengthen commitment to a full trial, especially when early improvement has not occurred. However, if a family decides to forgo a full trial of alarm therapy, their decision should be supported. Clinical follow-up should occur after the first 2 weeks of alarm therapy to provide support and identify early signs of success. Additional follow-up should depend on child and family needs. The usual treatment course is 12 to 16 weeks, though some children require longer[ [23](#ref23)]. Treatment should continue until the child has at least 14 consecutive days of dryness, and should be discontinued if there is no noticeable improvement after 6 weeks. Recent evidence suggests that relapse rates may be improved if the standard of 14 consecutive dry nights is extended[ [30](#ref30)]. Desmopressin is a synthetic vasopressin analog that has been used for enuresis since the 1970s. Intermittent use of desmopressin is recommended when families do not wish to use an alarm but do wish to help children control enuresis periodically or for special occasions (i.e., sleepovers, summer camp). Daily desmopressin use, with the aim of completely controlling enuresis, may be considered for select cases, but only after discussing potential benefits and limitations with the child and family. Desmopressin works by decreasing both urine volume and intravesical pressure at night. Desmopressin is effective for treating enuresis with a range of underlying mechanisms and may be especially useful for nocturnal polyuria with normal (rather than low) daytime bladder capacity (based on history, voiding diary use, and urine measurement)[ [42](#ref42)]. Daily use results in a full response in 30% of children, with another 40% experiencing a partial response[ [5](#ref5)][ [18](#ref18)][ [42](#ref42)]-[ [44](#ref44)]. The relapse rate is up to 70%[ [18](#ref18)][ [42](#ref42)]. Desmopressin is available in Canada in dissolvable (melt) and tablet forms. An intranasal form (upon which most Cochrane studies are based) has been discontinued in Canada due to unpredictable absorption and reports of rare but serious side effects. The melt has superior bioavailability and efficacy over the tablet, with an additional advantage of not requiring water to administer[ [45](#ref45)], but cost can be prohibitive. The tablet is available in generic form. When desmopressin is used intermittently, the lowest effective dose should be used. The usual melt dose is 120 mcg administered 30 to 60 minutes before sleep. The anti-enuretic effect has been observed soon after medication initiation[ [7](#ref7)] but, if dryness is not achieved, the dose can be doubled to 240 mcg. The maximum dose for desmopressin is 360 mcg. A 60 mcg dose is available and may suffice for some children. Caution is advised when prescribing because the melt is dispensed on an mcg basis, whereas the tablet is dispensed on an mg basis. Equivalent dosing is as follows: Melt 60 mcg = tablet 0.1 mg; Melt 120 mcg = tablet 0.2 mg. Side effects from desmopressin are uncommon[ [27](#ref27)]. However, the risks associated with water intoxication should be disclosed to all families contemplating this therapy. Water intoxication can be prevented by strictly restricting liquid intake to one sip with teeth-brushing, then limiting fluids to no more than 200 mL for at least 8 h (i.e., from 1 h before receiving medication until the next morning). No medication should be used on nights when a child's evening sports activities necessitate rehydration after dinner, or when the child has an illness affecting fluid balance[ [23](#ref23)]. Guidelines for continuous use of desmopressin suggest treatment for 3 months at a time, then reassessment with a medication break to determine resolution of enuresis symptoms[ [5](#ref5)]-[ [7](#ref7)]. Recent strategies involving a structured withdrawal show promise in improving permanent cure rates[ [46](#ref46)][ [47](#ref47)], with a recommended half-dose given for 2 weeks before discontinuation. If enuresis returns, the effective dose can be used again for 3 months, when reducing titration can be repeated. It is important to monitor serum electrolytes in a child taking continuous desmopressin (especially serum osmolality and sodium) approximately every 3 months. Evidence is emerging for the benefits of combining treatments for enuresis. Trials that have combined alarm use and desmopressin have reported some favourable results, especially for children with nocturnal polyuria who do not respond [45](#ref45)][ [47](#ref47)]. Anticholinergic (antispasmodic) medications target bladder overactivity but have been shown to be ineffective when used as monotherapy for enuresis and have more side effects than desmopressin[ [48](#ref48)][ [49](#ref49)]. These medications should only be used in rare cases and require the supervision of an expert (a paediatric urologist and/or nephrologist) familiar with the risks and adverse events associated with anticholinergics. There may be a role for combination treatment in children with LUTS or an enuresis pattern characteristic of small bladder capacity or overactive bladder (small, frequent night-time voids), who have not responded to other therapies. Before starting an anticholinergic, use ultrasound or uroflowmetry to ensure that the child is emptying the bladder with zero or insignificant post-void residual volumes. Oxybutynin is the most common anticholinergic prescribed in Canada, although tolterodine or solifenacin may be associated with fewer side effects[ [49](#ref49)]-[ [51](#ref51)]. Historically, tricyclic antidepressants were used to treat children with enuresis, but due to demonstrated serious cardiovascular and neurological adverse effects, they should only be used in exceptional cases and under the close supervision of a clinician expert in the use of these drugs[ [52](#ref52)][ [53](#ref53)]. Children who do not respond to education and reassurance, behavioural modifications, the bedwetting alarm, and/or desmopressin, and who are experiencing significant psychological distress should be referred to an expert in enuresis for consideration of further investigations and treatments. Families should be advised that the evidence base supporting these therapeutic options is limited, and research to determine their effectiveness is ongoing. Mirabegron is a selective agonist of the beta-3 adrenergic receptor present in the bladder wall. Mirabegron is used to treat overactive bladder (OAB) and acts by relaxing the detrusor muscle, similar to anticholinergic medications. Mirabegron does not cause constipation or other common anticholinergic-associated side effects and may be useful for children with NMSE and OAB who also have constipation or who experience negative side effects from anticholinergic medications[ [9](#ref9)][ [54](#ref54)]-[ [56](#ref56)]. Rare cases of reported[ [55](#ref55)][ [56](#ref56)]. If treatment with Mirabegron is considered, a referral to a paediatric urologist is recommended. Monitoring of blood pressure and post-void residual volumes is recommended before starting therapy and during follow-up. In very rare circumstances, and only in cases of extreme psychological distress, neuromodulation can be considered for older children and adolescents with refractory primary MSE. Transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation (TENS) provides electrical stimulation to the sacral nerves responsible for bladder control. Early evidence suggests that this therapy can be safe and efficacious for treating refractory enuresis in children[ [57](#ref57)]-[ [59](#ref59)]. TENS is a non-invasive procedure that provides electrical stimulation to the lower back through leads connected to adhesive pads attached to the skin at the level of S2 to S4. Families can buy or rent the TENS machine from a physiotherapy clinic, and treatment is typically recommended for 8 to 12 weeks. Other neurostimulation modalities are under study, and may be considered by specialists in refractory NMSE cases. 1. Education and reassurance are the mainstays of management for monosymptomatic or 'simple' enuresis (MSE). Talking with families about enuresis can help demystify the problem and alleviate guilt or stigma for children and parents. Emphasize that: 2. Conduct a history and physical exam to determine that enuresis is the correct diagnosis, to distinguish monosymptomatic from non-monosymptomatic enuresis, and to rule out common comorbidities, especially constipation, developmental and psychiatric conditions, and upper airway obstruction. 3. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may not be evident unless clinicians specifically ask about them. When LUTS are present, they should be addressed first or concurrently with treatment for enuresis. Referral to urology is appropriate when symptoms are severe, numerous, or atypical. 4. Work with patients and families to determine whether treatment is necessary or desired. Consider the impact of enuresis on the child's self-esteem, and family factors such as motivation, support, and available resources. Children who are not bothered by enuresis and whose self-esteem is intact, and families who are comfortable waiting for bedwetting to stop naturally, should be reassured that waiting is the recommended course of action. 5. Patients experiencing distress related to their enuresis may respond well to active treatment, such as an enuresis alarm and/or the intermittent use of desmopressin. If these two active therapies fail, and when further treatment is desired, refer to an expert in enuresis to consider further investigations and other active treatment options.
