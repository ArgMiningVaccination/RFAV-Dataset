Whether it's work issues, family problems, money worries, or a global pandemic - the world has a way of throwing us unexpected curveballs that can lead us to feel stressed.

Spend quality time A Zoom call with your friends, a cuddle on the sofa with your dog, or a walk in the park with your mum - sometimes spending quality time with our loved ones can be all we need to help us feel less stressed. Laughing and chatting help to release endorphins - the body's natural feel-good chemicals - which make us feel better. Being part of a close network of friends and family can also give you a sense of belonging and self-worth, which can really help on those tougher days. So, grab a cup of tea with your best mate and enjoy a good dose of serotonin. Move your body One of the most effective natural remedies for dealing with stress is exercise. Whether you escape the house for a 10km run, find a quiet room for half an hour of yoga, or join an online HIIT class, getting your body moving and your heart pumping is a great way to burn off anxious energy.
