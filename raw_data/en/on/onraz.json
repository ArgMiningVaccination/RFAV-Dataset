[Perri O. Blumberg](/author/4538/perri-o-blumberg/)and [Tehrene Firman](/author/10223/tehrene-firman/) Some days, we can go from healthy to hello, double cheeseburger with the bait of a well-timed Instagram. Some days, our brain says salmon but our stomach says ice cream sundae. Every damn day, we're looking for something to eat that will wipe out our afternoon slump and make us feel like we can finally catch up on our afternoon To Do list. Stock up on the ingredients ahead, and you'll ride that energy wave all through the evening. Walnuts While almonds are a great source of protein, walnuts are best at keeping your heart healthy. \"The bottom line is, the average American woman doesn't get enough omega-3 fatty acids, and you can find those in walnuts,\" says Evelyn Tribole, R.D., author of [The Ultimate Omega-3 Diet](http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Omega-3-Diet-Supercharge-Inflammation/dp/0071469869?ascsubtag=redbook.article.15281).

The leafy green veggie is [full of fiber and antioxidants](https://www.redbookmag.com/body/healthy-eating/tips/g2661/20-foods-you-should-eat-when-youre-stressed/?slide=10), which results in a nice energy boost.

Hard-Boiled Eggs Since eggs are rich in the amino acid tyrosine, eating them can [improve alertness](https://www.redbookmag.com/body/healthy-eating/tips/g2661/20-foods-you-should-eat-when-youre-stressed/?slide=17) and help you perk up a bit. But, why hard-boiled? All styles of eggs are full of nutrients, but since this kind isn't cooked with butter and oil, it's typically a healthier choice overall \u2014 all the saturated fat won't weigh you down. Sunflower Seeds This seed should definitely be part of your diet \u2014 especially if you want to up your energy levels. \"High in protein and omega-3s, these superfood seeds will give you real, protein-packed energy and help you focus,\" Lee says. They add a nice crunch to salad, or even guacamole. Mint Get a natural energy lift with this assertive herb. \"In your [salads](/food-recipes/a37779/best-salad-bar-choices/), on your berries, in your water \u2014 anywhere you add it, mint will give you a boost,\" say Lyssie Lakatos and Tammy Powder Spinach Frozen Grapes Avocado Toast With Eggs Sweet Potatoes Beans Tart Cherries Brown Rice Steel Cut Oats Chia Seeds Lemon Water Almonds Dried Fruit Grocery Shopping Hacks to Lose Weight 10 Vegan Options You Can Order At Burger King 16 Secrets To Make Vegetables Taste Even Better The 30 Healthiest Drinks You Can "}
