All your questions have been answered here. Dr Pankaj Aggarwal, senior homeopathy physician, says, \"Homeopathy is way considered best when it comes to safe and sound treatment as it is devoid of any kind side effects or after as in allopath and indulges in to the recovery of the disease or ailment as in Ayurveda where you need many sessions to cure the disease. Though they all do the same job to eliminating the root cause of the disease but Homeopathy heals with ease and eliminates other root causes to make to fit and healthy.\" The duration course is more than the allopath treatment, but less than the Ayurveda as there are certain exercising and healing sessions, meditation and dosage of natural herbs to cure the diseases, which might take time as every natural remedy is not available at one place. Every individual respond in a different manner to different medicines and treatments. This uniqueness of the symptoms and reactions brings in the difference in the remedy prescribed to each one of them. Whereas, in allopath the concept to treat the disease with the help of drugs, in Ayurveda healing is facilitated with the amalgamation of five elements of nature and in homeopathy the objective is to bring about a change in human body to make it responds in a better way to get the system right in place. Homeopathy Vs. Allopathy & Ayurveda Ayurveda is very much into healing that particular body part for say and allopath also do the same but comes with various side effects and risk of reactions to other parts of the body. But homeopathy is considered completely safe as it does not react in a other way to the body, instead helps to examine the past ailments and new developments in the body with proper and regular dosage of the drug prescribed. \"Homeopathy is medium through which one definitely gets rid of all their disease with a promise to not occur again in life as its main objective to eliminate the root cause and help a person cure in much better way with no painful injections and running to the doctor at every now and then,\" Dr Aggarwal added.
