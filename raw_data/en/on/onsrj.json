Spiritual healing is a general term for therapeutic modalities that heal on the physical, mental and emotional levels without requiring the client to take any medicines or remedies. The healing is purely effected through the use of Energy, Chi, Prana, or Light. Spiritual healing involves invocation to an intangible power. This universal energy is both powerful and subtle, which is the essence of all living things and is often described as Light, Vital Force or Life Force. [Spiritual healers](https://www.naturaltherapypages.com.au/spiritual/spiritual_healing/all) act as channels or conduits for this healing energy. Once they have tuned in to their client's energy and understood what needs to be healed, the practitioner can now direct it in such a way that it brings about relief and benefits the client. How Does Spiritual Healing Work? During the treatment session, the client should always be made to feel safe and comfortable. Some spiritual healers prefer to have their clients lie on a massage table, while others may ask if they'd rather remain seated on a chair. There are no strict protocols a healer must adhere to. Some healers may use touch as part of the healing process, while others will hold their hands a few inches away from the client's body or simply sit opposite them. Spiritual healing does require the client to disrobe. If they do not wish to be touched, they should not hesitate to let the healer know. Chakra balancing is a common example of spiritual healing. The chakra is the spiritual energy center within the human body. When the chakra becomes blocked or stressed, it can have a negative impact on the organs in the body that correspond to it, leading to negative emotional states like anxiety or depression. Different forms of spiritual healing can specifically address chakra health, namely [Reiki](https://www.naturaltherapypages.com.au/energetic_medicine/reiki), [Pranic Healing](https://www.naturaltherapypages.com.au/energetic_medicine/pranic_healing) and [Polarity Therapy](https://www.naturaltherapypages.com.au/energetic_medicine/polarity_therapy). The healers will use their sensitivity to view the clients' chakras, and if they are blocked, they can channel Light and Energy through them until they are released. Energy blockages anywhere in the body can be treated in similar ways, and the results are usually immediate and uplifting. Several healers also give their clients some useful advice and information in the form of channeling, through the use of angels or spirit guides. They may also include past life readings in the range of modalities. What are the Benefits of Spiritual Healing? The benefits of spiritual healing are far-reaching. It is most useful when medicine, surgery, physical therapy or supplements lose their effectiveness, or they are unable to bring about the complete recovery of the client. Spiritual healing usually picks up where other various treatments left off. Various chronic, recurring or nagging conditions can be healed or greatly relieved by more subtle healing processes. Spiritual healing is very empowering for the client, as it's the healer's ultimate desire to show each person how to heal themselves. People who refuse to take medications, or have long given up on standard treatments that have not given them a sliver of hope despite prolonged use of these, will benefit from a consultation with a spiritual healer. Spiritual healing can help treat a wide range of physical, mental and emotional ailments, including: - Anxiety - Depression - Cold and flu - Headache - Stress - Trauma - Fears and phobias - Lack of mental clarity - Insomnia - Heart disease - Chronic pain - Fatigue - Digestive issues - Infertility - Alzhemer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases - Infertility - Cancer What Can You Expect From Spiritual Healing? A spiritual healing session can last from an hour to an hour and a half and take place in the practitioner's office or online. [Distance spiritual healing](https://www.naturaltherapypages.com.au/spiritual/spiritual-healing-online), which is carried out through visualisation or by using a proxy, offers the same benefits as a face-to-face session. Before the channeling of healing energy begins, the healer will ask the client what their issues or concerns are and then explain the process to them. The client is then asked to sit comfortably on a chair or lie down on the treatment table fully clothed and relaxed. As the practitioner starts channeling energy into the client's body, the latter may experience a rush of physical sensations, ranging from warmth and comfort to cool and tingling. Other people reported even falling into a deep sleep and waking up with a great sense of mental clarity. Some people may not immediately feel the effects of the healing, but as the days go by, these will gradually set in. It's important that they follow the practitioner's self-care recommendations following treatment to unfold its profound and lasting effects. Most people will need between three to four sessions a month, but those with long-standing conditions will need at least eight. Is Spiritual Healing Safe? Spiritual healing is a natural, noninvasive approach to releasing stress and pain that affect the mind, body, emotions and spirit. Anyone, regardless of age, can benefit loads from it and restore their state of balance and wellbeing. "}
