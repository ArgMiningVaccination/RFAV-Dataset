Even a small amount of time spent outdoors can physically, mentally, and spiritually impact health positively. Especially during difficult times, stepping away from the computer, phone, or TV, and taking advantage of outside activities can benefit your health. Physical Benefits Research has shown that immersing oneself in nature influences the body. Spending time outdoors is typically connected to walking, running, biking, and hiking. Any exercise can reduce stress, improve pain, and brain function, and slow aging and heart disease. However, whether going outside to exercise or just spending a few minutes sitting outside to take in the fresh air has additional advantages. For example, it can do the following: - Lower cortisol - Reduce heart rate if aiming to enjoy nature casually - Stimulate the immune system through being around trees which emit chemicals called phytocides - Improves mood - Boost natural killer cells in the body that are important for fighting infection and cancer Some individuals aren't fans of the quiet that can come from just listening to outdoor surroundings. If you fall under this category, consider listening to music, podcasts, or audiobooks outside. This also might be a good time to call friends and family to catch up while you look at nature. Mental and Healing Advantages Frequently we reference healing spaces as a way to improve lifestyle, mental health, and healing. The outdoors is a powerful healing space. When the sun is out, it provides vitamin D, which is associated with improving mood disorders and the prevention of various illnesses. Walking meetings can also boost creativity, reduce mental fatigue, and increase attention and focus. If cold weather is delaying your interest in spending time outside, stepping outside for fresh air, or just sitting by a window and looking out at the sky, grass or trees can make an impact. One study showed that patients who had a room looking out on nature got out of the hospital after surgery a full day earlier than those that looked at a brick wall. It can be tough to enjoy the outdoors when it is rainy or snowy. Grab an umbrella or snow gear and try to see the beauty in the raindrops or snowflakes as you spend time outdoors. If you're not a fan of messy weather, sit by a window and try to appreciate how special nature is throughout the various seasons. Spiritual Connection There is substantial evidence that people who engage in spiritual and religious practices stay healthy longer and recover faster. Various religions have incorporated nature into their belief systems for centuries. Greek temples surrounded patients with nature, music, and art to restore harmony and promote healing. Chinese and Indian systems of care use space and geography to promote healing. Japanese medicine uses \"forest bathing\" - going into the woods - as a healing method. Nature also frequently provides positive images for meditation. Just as winter turns to spring, one's self-healing capacity can move from sickness into health. The restorative quality of nature and your own body is an important image to hold onto throughout your health and wellness journey. Social Connections Take advantage of the warmer weather to get outside and catch up with friends and family over a walk in nature. Sharing a walk outdoors may also help you connect with your coworkers.
