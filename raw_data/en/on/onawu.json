We receive updates to VigiBase twice a week Run clustering algorithm weekly Pfizer Moderna by platform (mRNA, vector, inactivated) Team members with clinical expertise review the clusters Disproportionality Reported medication errors 1(2) 1697 cases (MedDRA -SMQ Narrow) distribution 1021 cases (60.2%), Male: 663 cases (39.1%) United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and PolandReported medication errors 2(2) Vaccines terms 1697 reports Vaccines Pfizer -BioNTech Moderna Astra -Zeneca What have been seen so far? Incorrect schedule of product administration -received second dose within a short period of time Under/overdose -dilution, syringe problem Incorrect route of product administration -given subcutaneous Product label confusionConclusion VigiBase reflects what have been seen so far Spontaneous reports contains limited information of why the error happened Challenging opportunities to apply risk minimization actions to prevent unnecessary patient harmUppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) Box "}
