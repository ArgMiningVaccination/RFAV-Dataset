Sentencing circles \u2014 sometimes called peacemaking circles \u2014 use traditional circle ritual and structure to in volve the victim, victim supporters, the offender, offender supporters, judge and court personnel, prosecutor, defense counsel, police, and all interested community members. Within the circle , people can speak from the heart in a shared search for understanding of the event, and togethe r identify the steps necessary to assist in healing all affected parties and prevent future crimes. Sentencing circles typically involve a multi-step pr ocedure that includes: (1) application by the offender to participate in the circle process; (2) a healing circle for the victim; (3) a healing circle for the offender; (4) a sentencing circle to develop consensus on the elements of a sentencing plan; and (5) follow-up circles to monitor the prog ress of the offender. The sentencing plan may incorporate commitments by the system, community, and family members, as well as by the offender. Sentencing circles are used for adult and ju venile offenders with a variety of offenses and have been used in both rural and urban settings. Specifics of the circle process vary from community to community and are designed locally to fit community needs and culture . Sentencing circles have been developed most ex tensively in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Yukon and have been used occasionally in several other communities. Their use spread to the United States in 1996 when a pilot project was initiated in Minnesota. Goals The goals of sentencing circles include: Promote healing for all affected parties. Provide an opportunity for the offender to make amends. Empower victims, community members, fa milies, and offenders by giving them a voice and a shared responsibility in finding constructive resolutions. Address the underlying causes of criminal behavior. Build a sense of community and its capacity for resolving conflict. Promote and share community values. Implementation A successful sentencing circle process depends upon a healthy partnership between the formal justice system and the community . Participants from both need training and skill building in the circle process, peacemaking, and consensus building. The community can subsequently customize the circle process to fit local resources and culture. It is critic ally important that the community's planning process allows sufficient time for strong relationships among justice professionals and community members to develop. Implementation procedures must be highly flexible, because the circle process will evolve over time based on the community's knowledge and experience. In many communities, direction and leadership are provided by a community justice committee that decides which cases to accept, develops support groups for the victim and offender, and helps to conduct circles. In most communities , circles are facilitated by a trained community member, who is often called a \"keeper.\" Sentencing circles are not appropriate for all o ffenders. The connection of the offender to the community, the sincerity and nature of the offender's efforts to be healed, the input of victims, and the dedication of the offender's support group are key factors in determining whether a case is appropriate for the circle process. Because communi ties vary in health and in their capacity to deal constructively with conflict, representatives of the formal justice system must participate in circles to ensure fair treatment of both victims and offenders. The capacity of the circle to advance solutions capable of improving the lives of participants and the overall well-being of the community depend s upon the effectiveness of the participating volunteers. To ensure a cadre of capable volunteers, the program should support a paid community-based volunteer coordinator to supply logistical support, establish linkages with other agencies and community repres entatives, and provide appropriate training for all staff. Lessons Learned Very little research has been conducted to date on the effectiveness of s entencing circles. One study conducted by Judge Barry Stuart (1996) in Canada indicated that fewer offenders who had gone through the circle recidivated than offender s who were processed by standard criminal justice practices. Those who have been involv ed with circles report that circles empower participants to resolve conflict in a manner that shares responsibility for outcomes; generate constructive relationships; enhance respect and understanding among all involved; and foster enduring, innovative solutions.
