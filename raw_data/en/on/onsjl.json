T. Still Tenets of Osteopathic Medicine 5 Models of Osteopathic Medicine Opioids Pain and the Military Pain Pathway Osteopathy and Pain Settings: Battlefield, clinic, anywhere Osteopathy and Alternative Medicine Military and Osteopathic Medicine19thcentury medicine American medical training lagged far behind it 's European counterpart Disorganized at best; highly variable healing traditions \"Regular\"(Allopathic medicine) \"Heroic Therapies \" Bleeding, purging, blistering Arsenic, mercury, belladonna Homeopathy, Botanical Medicine, Phrenology, Mysticism, Spiritual Medicine, Indigenous healers, etc. Birth of 19thCentury Intellectualism Movement toward holism Phrenology was a seminal science Science of the mind Body and mind are part of the universe and thus subject to universal laws Following these laws through knowledge and management can optimize mental and physical health Evolution, Physiology, Anatomy, Neurology Literature, philosophy, economicsOsteopathic History Andrew Taylor Still, MD Born August 6, 1828 in Jonesboro, Virginia Apprenticed father, a physician and Methodist minister MD, Kansas City School of Physicians and Surgeons Surgeon and Major, Union Army during Civil War 1864 -AT. Still Whole family sick with meningitis Physicians unable to help with heroic medicine Three children died Faith in regular medicine shaken forever Why Osteopathy? Environment Dissatisfaction with \"regular\" medicine Intellectual shift toward holism Scientific milieu fostered reformDr. Still \"Cure\" often worse than \"illness\" Medicine is \"disease based\" not \"health based\"The object of the physician is to find health, any fool can find disease.Early Osteopathy Anatomy, anatomy, anatomy \"To know a bone in its entirety would close both ends of eternity\" \"You must begin with anatomy, and end with anatomy, a knowledge of anatomy is all you want or need\"Early Osteopathy Anatomy, anatomy, anatomy \"The artery is a river of life, health, and ease, and if muddy or impure disease follows.\" \"The rule of the artery must be absolute, universal and unobstructed, or disease will result.\"Osteopathic Tenets The Tenets of Osteopathic Medicine express the underlying philosophy of Osteopathic Principles and Practice (OPP) and were approved by the AOA House of Delegates as policy. The body is a unit of mind, body and spirit. The body is capable of self -regulation, self -healing and health maintenance. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated. Rational treatment is based upon an understanding of the basic principles of body unity, self -regulation and the interrelationhsip of structure and function.1892: American School of Osteopathy Started in a small house with his own savings 18 students, 5 women Johns Hopkins started the next year with a $7 million grant Women made up 20% of the first DO class vs. 5% in MD schoolsOsteopathic Medicine 38 accredited COMs, in 59 locations 25% of medical students are future DOs >145,00 osteopathic physicians and students (2018) 5 Osteopathic Pathophysiological Models Academy of Osteopathy Assessing patient functioning, assessment and care central to OPP Biomechanical -Structural Respiratory -Circulatory Osteopathic Diagnosis and Treatment: An FAAO Thesis, 1 Jan T. Hendryx , DO, FAAO Biomechanical -Structural Primarily from a structural perspective. Emphasize anatomy: muscles, spine and extremities; posture and motion. OMT directed to normalizing biomechanical somatic dysfunctions (joints, myofascia ), thus restoring normal structural integrity, physiological functioning, adaptive potential and homeostasis. OMT to normalize biomechanics include high energy, counterstrain , ligamentous articular strain, myofascial release, facilitated positional release and Still technique. Respiratory -Circulatory Emphasizes normalization of pulmonary, cardiovascular, and circulation of fluids (blood, lymph, cerebrospinal fluid). Horizontal diaphragms (tentorium cerebelli, respiratory, cage, extracellular matrix, lymphatics and viscera (heart, lungs, kidneys) are important anatomical structures addressed. Osteopathy in the cranial field, cervical, thoracic and rib mobilization, lymphatic drainage, respiratory diaphragm myofascial release, and visceral osteopathic manipulative techniques are helpful in restoring health The Bioenergetic Model in Osteopathic Diagnosis and Treatment in combination with medications, surgery, intravenous fluids and even ventilation as appropriate.5 Osteopathic Pathophysiological Models The Bioenergetic Model in Osteopathic Diagnosis and Treatment: An FAAO Thesis, Part 1 Jan T. Hendryx , DO, FAAO Neurological Peripheral, autonomic and central nervous system Control, coordinate and integrate body functions. Proprioceptive reflex and muscle strength imbalances, spinal segmental faci litation, nerve compression and entrapment disorders, visceral dysfunctions, nociceptive influences and brain dysfunctions are common problems. Manipulative treatment may include osteopathy in the cranial field, Chapman reflexes, rib raising, counterstrain , muscle energy, neural release and inhibition. Exercise therapy, including proprioceptive balance training, stretching and strengthening. Appropriate neurological evaluation, referral, surgery and medications may be appropriate in patient management. Metabolic -Nutritional Maximizing the efficiency of the patient's natural self -regulatory and self -healing mechanisms. Homeostatic adaptive responses are orchestrated through positive and negative feedback systems to regulate various forms of e nergy exchange and conservation that occur through metabolic processes and organ functioning. The neuroendocrine -immune system and all internal organs are the focus. Lifestyle changes such as appropriate exercise, nutritional counseling and stress reduction are primary therapeutic modalitie s, as are appropriate use of medications. Osteopathic manipulative treatment includes lymphatic pump and visceral techniques.5 Osteopathic Models in Osteopathic Diagnosis and Treatment: An FAAO Thesis, Part 1 Jan T. Hendryx , DO, FAAO Behavioral -Biopsychosocial Addresses a patient's mental, emotional, social and spiritual dimensions in relationship to health and disease. Mind -body interactions can have a huge influence on a patient's wellbeing and functioning in society. Depression, anxiety, stress, habits, addictions and numerous other conditions must be addressed appropriately, often in conjunction with medications, psychiatry or psychotherapies, stress reduction, meditation, and support groups. Military and Osteopathic Medicine AT Still MD, Kansas City School of Physicians and Surgeons Surgeon and Major, Union Army during Civil War Found that being an MD lacked resource and applicability on the battle field. His resourcefulness of utilizing principles of OPP and OMM were very helpful in any setting.

Alternate Routes in treatment of pain...? Doctor of Osteopathy Doctor Deploy anywhere Use their skill to diagnose and treat, anywhereOsteopathy and Pain Apply not only traditional approaches to pain management, but also incorporate osteopathic principles and treatment methods, including manipulative approaches and behavioral approaches. Understand the presence of somatic dysfunction as a key contributor to pain generation and modulator of the sensation of pain. Apply medical management with behavioral and neuromusculoskeletal interventions to pain patients. Osteopathic physicians have a unique role as providers of comprehensive pain care.Osteopathy and Alternative Medicine OMM is a treatment option from a physician. OMM has no cost for resources, as it is the physician. OMM compliments other forms of treatment as the goal is to optimize the pts health via decreasing restrictions in pts tissue. Contraindications for OMM are specific to technique. Direct techniques Pt is interactive, tissue brought to restrictive barrier Therefore, moving a region with a fractured bone does not work well Indirect techniques Pt in not interactive, tissue brought to area of ease Therefore, be considerate about the current condition of the pt, ie. Region with surgical incision, fracture, etc. Military and Osteopathy: Conclusions Tenets The body is a unit of mind, body and spirit. The body is capable of self -regulation, self -healing and health maintenance. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated. Rational treatment is based upon an understanding of the basic principles of body unity, self -regulation and the interrelationhsip of structure and function. Models Utilization of OPP/OMT for care of defense and veteran pts in any setting. Benefits Osteopathic manipulation is based in using organic resources of our hands and thought process. OPP/OMT is a skill that is in the provider, not outsourced or adding additional costs ie.
