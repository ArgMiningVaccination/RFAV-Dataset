It increases the disease burden and hampers quality of life. This study was aimed at exploring the effects of individualized home opathic medicines (IHMs) against placebo in the treatment of HU.Methods This double-blind, randomized, place bo-controlled trial was conducted on 60 patients suffering from HU in the outpatient department of D. N. De HomoeopathicMedical College and Hospital, Kolkata. Each patient received either IHMs or identical-looking placebos, along with advice on dietary modi cations irrespective of codes. Serum uric acid (SUA) level was the primary outcome measure; the HU quality of life questionnaire (HUQLQ) and the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Pro le version 2 (MYMOP-2) were the secondary outcomes; all measured at baseline, and every month,up to 3 months. Group differences were examined by two-way (split-half) repeated-measures analysis of variance after adjusting for baseline differences. Signi cance level was set at p/C200.05, two-tailed. Results The sample ( n\u00bc58) was 56\u00bc13.833, scores ( F1, 56\u00bc32.982, received November 25, 2021accepted after revision March 22, 2022 article published online September 19, 2022\u00a9 2022.

Article published online: 2022-09-19Introduction Hyperuricemia (HU) is a disorder in purine metabolism, either excess in production and/or failure in excretion, resulting in anincrease in serum uric acid -6 mg/dL). 1This excess SUA may form sharp crystals in blood and produce the manifestations ofgout. 2HU also shows a close association with cardiovascular and kidney diseases,diabetesmellitusandobesity.3In a review on population-based prevalence, HU was placed at 13thposi- tion among 21 disorders contributing to the Global Burden of Disease.4About 21% of the general population and 25% of hospitalized patients had asymptomatic HU worldwide.5As per the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, approximately 20.2% men and 20.0% women weresuffering from HU in 2015 to 2016 in the U.S. population.6 Overall prevalence of HU in India was 25.8% and disease burden was higher when both type 2 diabetes and hyperten- sionwere present together. In West Bengal, the prevalence was3.2%. 7,8HU prevalence was also higher in different Asian countries such as Taiwan, Japan and China in comparison to the UnitedStates, Brazil and Italy.9Urate-lowering therapy, like allopurinol, probenecid and febuxostat, is the mainstay treat- ment despite having certain unavoidable toxicities and limitations.10,11 HU falls under Bouchard 's old classi cation of arthritic diathesis (uric acid diathesis).12Musculoskeletal and rheu- matic disorders are amongst the most frequently treated complaints treated by homeopathic medicines13,14and com- prise a signi cant section of the published literature of clinical trials in homeopathy.15Until 2011, 43 relevant trials of homeopathy had been identi ed\u201426 peer-reviewed, the remainder not peer-reviewed. Among the peer-reviewedpublications, seven were trials of individualized homeopath- ic medicines (IHMs) against placebo, 14 were of non-IHMs against placebo, two were IHMs against other than placebo(OTP) and three were non-IHMs against OTP. 15 Although the homeopathy literature contains ample num- bers of successfully treated cases of HU and gout, high qualityresearch evidence \u2014especially randomized controlled trials \u2014 remains scarce. A clinical case series of 10 patients suffering from acute gout showed improvement of all acute symptomsand reduction of SUA levels after homeopathic treatment. 16 In one non-randomized, open-label, single-arm study on 32adults suffering from gout, a promising treatment effect ofIHMs was observed in SUA levels, Gout Assessment Ques- tionnaire (GAQ-2) scores and Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Pro le-2 (MYMOP-2) scores. 17Another open butrandomized trial on 90 patients suffering from HU with three parallel arms (i.e., IHMs, Urtica urens mother tincture [UUMT] and IHMs plus UUMT), revealed that IHMs \u00feUUMT worked slightly better than the others in improving SUA levels, GAQ-2 scores and MYMOP-2 scores.18One case report of HU with nephrolithiasis revealed reduction SUA aftertreatment with IHMs. 19However, no published ef cacy trial of IHMs in HU could be identi ed, leading the authors to plan and conduct the trial reported here. Methods Study Design This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two par-allel arms trial was conducted at the outpatient departmentof D. N. De Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital, Govt. of West Bengal, India. Based on the research, a full dissertation was submitted as the postgraduate thesis of thecorresponding author to the West Bengal University of Health Sciences (WBUHS). The total study duration was 18 months: from mid-October 2019 to mid-April 2021. Participants The inclusion criteria were patients aged between 18 and 65 years, of either sex, suffering from HU (ICD-10-CM code E79.0; SUA level above 7 mg/dL in men and above 6 mg/dLfor women, for at least the past 3 months), literate (able to read Bengali and/or English), and willing to provide their written informed consent. Patients already receiving treat-ment for HU were enrolled into the study after a washout period of 1 month, subject to ful lment of the eligibility criteria. Exclusion criteria were cases of overt HU (SUA morethan 10 mg/dL), secondary gout, severe or advanced gout requiring surgical procedures or orthopaedic corrections, unstable mental or psychiatric illness or other systemicdisease affecting quality of life, currently receiving homeo- pathic treatment for any chronic condition(s), self-reported immune-compromised state, pregnant, puerperal andlactating women, and cases of substance abuse and/or dependence. Research Ethics The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC) (Ref. No. DHC/Eth-45/2018/643/19, datedSeptember 17, 2019) and was registered prospectively in the Clinical Trials Registry \u2014India (CTRI) (Trial registration no. CTRI/2019/10/021503; secondary identi were statistically signi cant, favoring IHMs against placebos, with medium to large effect sizes. Calcarea carbonica and Pulsatilla nigricans were the most frequently prescribed medicines. No serious adverse events were reported from either of the groups.Conclusion IHMs showed signi cantly better results than placebos in reducing SUA levels and improving quality of life in patients suffering from HU.

The protocol was in accordance with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki on human experimen-tation. 20Each participant expressed his or her informed consent to take part in the trial. Intervention \u0081Verum \u2014In the experimental arm, IHMs were adminis- tered in centesimal potencies. Each dose consisted of six to eight globules (no. 20) of cane sugar, medicated with the indicated medicine (preserved in 90% v/v ethanol),taken orally on a clean tongue and with empty stomach; dosage and repetition depending upon the individual requirement of the case. Patients were advised to refrainfrom handling the globules or from eating, drinking, smoking or from brushing teeth within 30 minutes of taking the globules, and were asked to suck the globulesrather than simply swallowing them. The homeopathic medicines and sundry goods were purchased in bulk from Hahnemann Publishing Company (HAPCO), Kolkata. Bothmedicines and placebos were re-packed in identical glass bottles and labeled with code, name of medicine and its potency, and were dispensed according to a randomnumber list. A single medicine was prescribed on each occasion, considering the presenting symptom totality, clinical history, constitutional features, and repertoriza-tion by appropriate repertories, using HOMPATH ZOMEO 3.0 software when required. Materia medica was con- sulted and consensus was arrived at among three homeo-paths for the nal selection of the medicine and dosage. Provision was made to change the medicines or potencies and adjust the dosage in subsequent visits, in compliancewith homeopathic principles. Each of two of the homeo- paths possessed a Master 's degree in homeopathy, with more than 20 years of teaching experience and practicing classical homeopathy. The other prescriber was either one of two postgraduate trainees or a house staff member ofthe institution. All the homeopaths involved were af li- ated with their respective state council. \u0081Comparator \u2014This group received identical looking plac- ebos for a period of 3 months. Each dose of placebos consisted of six to eight globules (no. 20), moistened with non-medicinal recti ed spirit, and taken orally on a clean tongue and with empty stomach; dosage and repetition depended upon the requirement of individual cases. Dosage regimen was similar to that of verum. \u0081Concomitant care \u2014Irrespective of the allocated codes, all the patients received dietary instructions, which included lacto-vegetarian and low-fructose diet, restriction ormoderation of high purine content food (e.g., meat, poul- try, sea food, yeast and yeast extracts, cauli flower, mush- rooms, lentils, spinach, beans, peas), moderation ofalcohol consumption, and plenty of fluids (2 L/d). 21Com- pliance to the advice was assured by reminders to the participants in weekly phone calls and at every follow-upvisit by the research assistants. Returned globules were counted to check consumed dosage and were recorded in the drug accountability log.Outcomes Primary: \u0081SUA levels were measured at baseline and every month up to 3 months. Secondary: \u0081Hyperuricemia quality of life (HUQLQ) is a validated patients 'self-administered questionnaire in the Bengali language, consisting of 19 items and framed within ve components: concern; inconvenience in daily activities; professional restriction; mood and ment hazards.22Items are derived from the GAQ-2 ques- tionnaire. Each item is measured on a 5-point (0 -4) Likert scale: the higher the score, the greater is the problem. \u0081MYMOP-2 is a patient-administered questionnaire.23,24It requires the patient to specify one or two symptoms which are concerning them the most and for which they are seeking treatment. It is problem-speci ca n dr e flects daily activity (physical, mental, social) as well as general wellbeing. Each of the four items is rated on a 7-point scale, where \"0\"means \"as good as it could be \"and 6means \"as bad as it could be \". Hence a decrease in the MYMOP-2 score represents an improve- ment in health outcome. A mean of the four item scores is calculated and is referred to as the \"MYMOP-2 pro le score \". Sample Size No formal sample size calculation was possible owing to the absence of relevant published data from any clinical trial ofsimilar design. Also, the minimal clinically important difference of SUA levels was not pre-established. In an earlier study, mean SUA level was reduced from 7.4 ( /C61.2) to 5.9 ( /C61.2) after 3 months of intervention using IHMs. 18We assumed 7 to 8% mean reduction in the mean SUA level in the placebo group after 3 months of intervention. Effect size (Cohen 'sd) was estimated as 0.792. With this assumed effect size and 1:1 allocation, to detect a statistically signi cant difference between two independent means of SUA levels using unpaired t-test, a study with 54 (27/C22) patients would provide 80% power based on a two- sided signi cance level of 5%. Allowance for a 10% attrition rate inflated the target sample size further to 60 (30 /C22). Randomization A random number chart was generated using the StatTrek random number generator, by an independent third party, using the permuted block randomization method (sixvariable blocks of xed size 10; 6 /C210\u00bc60) and maintaining a 1:1 ratio. Thus, an equal number of participants was randomized to the verum and the control groups. Blinding The double-blinding method was adopted by masking thepatients and the treating physicians. The pharmacist, outcome assessors and data entry operators were also kept blinded throughout the trial. Identical looking vials were coded aseither \"1\"or\"2\"and contained either medicines or alike placebos. Codes were assigned randomly and con dentially by an independent third party. Both medicines and placebos Homeopathy Vol. 112 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2022. The Faculty of Homeopathy.

The vials were destined for each patient by the random number chart. Codes werebroken at the end of the trial after the dataset was frozen. Allocation Concealment Blinded postgraduate trainees were involved in screening,enrollment and assigning serial numbers to the participants. Subsequently, the blinded participants were interviewed by the blinded homeopaths for prescription. Thus, allocationconcealment was achieved by having both the recruiters and the treating physicians unaware of the randomization sequence. The blinded pharmacist was provided in strictcondentiality with the coded random number chart for dispensing of either medicines or alike placebos to the participants sequentially. Statistical Methods The intention-to-treat (ITT) approach was followed25: i.e., every included patient who had baseline measurements and at least 1 month follow-up was entered into the nal analy- sis. Missing values were replaced by predicted values from alinear regression model. Data distribution was examined by histograms, Q plots, signi cant departure from Normality was identi ed. For examining baseline comparability of the confounders, unpaired t-tests, the Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square tests were applied. The baseline differences inSUA levels, MYMOP-2 activity and pro le scores were adjusted using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models. Group differences were examined by two-way repeatedmeasures analysis of variance (ANOVA) models overall and by unpaired t-tests at different time points. Effect size was presented in terms of Cohen 'sd(small effect, 0.2; medium effect, 0.5; large effect, 0.8). Intra-group changes with time were measured using one-way repeated measures ANOVA.Ap-value /C200.05 (two-tailed) was considered as statistically signicant. SPSS-IBM version 20 was used for data analysis. Reporting of Adverse Events Patients were instructed to report any harm, serious adverse event, unintended effect or undue aggravations. Trial Reporting The trial report has been compiled in compliance with theConsolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 26and Reporting Data on Homeopathic Treatment (RedHot)27guide- lines ( Supplementary les 1 and2, available online only). Results Participant Flow A total of 94 patients were screened as per the pre-speci ed inclusion and exclusion criteria; 34 were excluded onaccount of various reasons and 60 eligible patients were enrolled. Baseline socio-demographic and outcome data were obtained, and the patients were randomized to receiveeither IHMs or identical-looking placebos. The outcome data were recorded every month up to 3 months. Attrition rate of the study was 10% (two from verum and four from placebo); 58 patients (verum, 28; placebos, 30) were subjected to ITTanalysis ( Fig. 1 ). Recruitment From October 2019 until January 2021, a total of 60 partic- ipants were enrolled into the trial. Follow-up of the last enrolled patient was completed by mid-April 2021. Baseline Data No signi cant group differences were found in the distribution of socio-demographic variables between groups (all p>0.05) (Table 1 ). Signi cantly different distribution at baseline was observed in levels ( p\u00bc0.051), MYMOP-2 activity pro score ( p\u00bc0.025), which were adjusted subsequently using ANCOVA models (Tables 2 ,4). Numbers Analyzed Outcomes were complete from 28/30 and from 26/30 patients in the IHMs and placebo groups respectively; the remainder dropped out of the trial. The data from 58 patients (IHMs, 28; placebos, 30) entered into the nal analyses. Fig. 1 CONSORT flow diagram.

Outcomes and Estimation \u0081SUA levels: Intra-group changes after 3 months showed statistically signi cant improvement in both the groups: p<0.001 and p\u00bc0.003 in the IHMs and placebo groups respectively. Overall, inter-group difference was signi Inter-group differences were allstatistically signi cant, with medium to large effect sizes favoring IHMs compared with placebos at all different time points (month 1, p\u00bc0.035, d\u00bc0.542; month 2, p\u00bc0.012, Statistically signi cant intra-group changes were obtained after 3 months in total score andall sub-scale scores in both the verum and placebo groups (allp<0.05, except mood and temperament sub-scale score and HUQLQ total score in the placebo group). Inter-group differences were statistically signi cant, with medium to large effect sizes in total score and all sub- scale scores (all p<0.05) favoring IHMs against placebos after 3 months of intervention ( Table 3 ). \u0081MYMOP-2 scores: Intra-group changes after 3 months of treatment revealed statistically signi cant changes (all p<0.05) in all the sub-scales scores of both the verum and the placebo groups. Inter-group differences were statisti- cally signi cant (all p<0.05), with small to large effect sizes in MYMOP-2 pro le score and most of the sub-scale scores, favoring IHMs over placebos ( Table 4 ).Table 1 Comparison of the socio-demographic characteristics between two groups at baseline ( N\u00bc58) Feature group (n\u00bc28)Placebo group /C610.2 0.095 Duration of (months)b12 (7, 14.2) 12 (6, 12) 0.245 Anthropometric measuresa Body mass index 25.4 /C61.7 25.7 /C61.6 0.458 W a i s th e i g h tr a t i o 0 . 5 0.086 Female 21 (75) 16 (53.3) Residencec Rural 1 (3.6) 2 (6.7) 0.853 Semi-urban 9 (32.1) 10 (33.3)U r b a n 1 8( 6 4 . 3 ) 1 8( 6 0 ) Family history of hyperuricemia c13 (46.4) 9 (30) 0.197 Food habitc V e g e t a r i a n 2( 7 . 1 ) 3( 1 0 ) 0 . 6 9 8 Non-vegetarian 26 (92.9) 27 (90) Risk factorsc Tobacco 4 (14.3) 7 (23.3) 0.959Alcohol 7 (25) 10 (33.3)R e dm e a t 2 6( 9 2 . 9 ) 2 6( 8 6 . 7 ) S e af o o d 2 1( 7 5 ) 2 2( 7 3 . 3 ) S o f td r i n k 1 9( 6 7 . 9 ) 2 1( 7 0 )No exercise 24 (85.7) 29 (96.7) Treatment taken c Allopathy 5 (17.9) 7 (23.3) 0.607 Co-morbiditiesc D i a b e t e sm e l l i t u s 2( 7 . 1 ) 5( 1 6 . 7 ) 0 . 2 7 9Dyspepsia 5 (17.9) 6 (20)Headache 4 (14.3) 1 (3.3)Hypertension 8 (28.6) 5 (16.7) Hypothyroidism 5 (17.9) 2 (6.7) I n s o m n i a 1( 3 . 6 ) 3( 1 0 )Miscellaneous 3 (10.7) 8 (26.7) Marital status c Married 27 (96.4) 25 (83.3) 0.102 Single and others 1 (3.6) 5 (16.7) (Continued )Table 1 (Continued ) Feature IHMs group (n\u00bc28)Placebo group (n\u00bc30)p Educational less 11 (39.3) 12 (40) 0.813 9th-12thstd. 13 (46.4) 12 (40) Higher than 12thstd.4 (14.3) 6 (20) Employment statusc Service 6 (21.4) 4 (13.3) 0.683 Business 10 (35.7) 13 (43.3)Dependent and others12 (42.9) 13 (43.3) Income status c Poor 5 (17.9) 6 (20) 0.975 M i d d l e 1 7( 6 0 . 7 ) 1 8( 6 0 ) Affluent 6 (21.4) 6 (20) Abbreviation: IHMs, individualized homeopathic medicines. aContinuous data presented as mean /C6standard deviation and unpaired t-tests applied. bContinuous data presented as median (interquartile range) and Mann- Whitney Utests applied. cCategorical data presented as absolute values (percentages) and Chi- square test (Yates corrected) applied; p/C200.05 two-tailed was consid- ered as Vol. 112 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2022.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Medicines Used A total of 26 different IHMs were prescribed in both the verum and placebo groups. Among those, Calcarea most frequently prescribed medicines ( Table 5 ). Adverse Events No serious adverse events were reported throughout the study. Five and nine minor adverse events respectivelyoccurred in the verum and placebo groups; however, all those seemed to be independent events rather than attrib- utable to the interventions. In the verum group, adverseevents such as headache, vomiting, coryza, fever and upper respiratory tract infection occurred. All were treated suc- cessfully by homeopathic medicines, except a case of feverwhere the patient took over-the-counter paracetamol 650 mg, two tablets, 6 hourly. In the placebo group, adverse events such as fever, diarrhea, headache, vomiting, neck pain,gastritis and vertigo were recorded. Two individuals with fever took over-the-counter paracetamol 650 mg. One case of neck pain and another case of gastritis took non-steroidalanti-in flammatory drugs. Other adverse events were suc- cessfully treated with short-acting homeopathic medicines as per indications (e.g., diarrhea with Aloe socotrina 30cH, headache with Belladonna 30cH, Spongia tosta 30cH), and once recovered they were returned to the previously allocated groups.Discussion This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on58 patients suffering from HU showed statistically signi - cant improvement in both the primary and secondary out-comes, with medium to large effect sizes after 3 months of intervention, favoring IHMs against placebos. Being a randomized controlled trial, the methodological strengths of the study were in-built in its design: minimized selection bias, balancing of the two groups with respect toconfounders, and establishing the basis for inferential statis- tical tests by ensuring comparability between groups at baseline. The advantages conferred by blinding were mini-mized performance bias, ascertainment bias and detection bias. Further strengths included the choice of an objective measure (i.e., SUA) as the primary outcome and selection of astandardized and pre-validated disease-speci c quality of life questionnaire (i.e., HUQLQ) and a generic patient- reported outcome measure (i.e., MYMOP-2) as the secondaryoutcomes. Adjustment of baseline differences in the outcome measures was accomplished prior to running inferential statistics. The sample size may seem inadequate to draw any conclusive recommendations. However, with an effect size of 1.352 as detected after 3 months of intervention in the SUAlevels, to detect a statistically signi cant difference between two independent means of SUA levels using unpaired t-test, a replication trial with 20 (10 /C22) patients would provide 80% power based on a two-sided signi cance level of 5%. Thus, our achieved sample size of 58, though it was based onTable 2 Comparison of the serum uric acid level at different time points ( N\u00bc58; baseline differences adjusted by ANCOVA) aUnpaired t-tests; t56:tscore at 56 degrees of freedom. paInter-group differences detected by unpaired t-tests. pbInter-group differences detected by two-way repeated measures ANOVA detected by one-way repeated measures Homeopathy Vol. 112 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2022.

An intervention period of 3 months only may be considered as an important limitation of the study. However, furtherlengthening of the period would have attracted ethical con- cerns in a placebo-controlled trial. Dif culties were faced in achieving compliance with follow-up due to the COVID-19pandemic situation and imposed lockdown: six patients dropped out. Some IHMs were used as \"rescue remedies \"to treat acute ailments that were probably unrelated to the trial.This additional homeopathic treatment might have acted as confounder to the trial-speci c medicines; nevertheless, these were \"short acting \"remedies selected on the \"acute totality \"ofthe cases and were unlikely to affect theactions of trial-speci c medicines. 28,29After the acute phases were over, the patients were re-evaluated by the treating physicians. Either the same trial medicine of the same code was repeated, or new medi-cines were prescribed according to the symptomatology of the patient and as decided appropriate to the case or condition by the physicians. There are ample references in the literature to the homeo- pathic treatment of HU and gout. Burnett advocated two distinct treatment approaches for pre-deposit and post-depos-it symptoms. 30Farrington suggested dividing the treatment of gout into management of the acute paroxysm and of the general symptoms.31Grauvogl advocated that direction F 1, 56 26.387 pb<0.001/C3/C3/C3 Partial eta squared 0.320 Treatment hazards score aUnpaired t-tests; t56:tscore at 56 degrees of freedom. paInter-group differences detected by unpaired t-tests. pbInter-group differences detected by two-way repeated measures ANOVA detected by one-way repeated measures Homeopathy Vol. 112 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2022.

Timely treatment with proper IHMs, considering the predominating miasmaticstate, can successfully prevent the propagation of miasm to a parent 's offspring. 37 A clinical case series of 10 patients suffering from acute gout revealed that all acute symptoms resolved, along with reductions in SUA levels, after homeopathic treatment, which is a similar nding to ours.16In a non-randomized,open-label, single-arm trial conducted on 32 adults suffer- ing from gout, a positive treatment effect of IHMs wasnoted in alleviating the symptoms of gout and improving the quality of life. 17Outcome measures used were SUA and MYMOP-2, the same as in our trial. In an open, randomized, three parallel arms pragmatic trial on 90 patients suffering from HU, IHMs plus UUMT worked better than IHMs orUUMT alone. 18Again, the outcome measures used were SUA and MYMOP-2. An animal model study and 1000cH revealed hypouricemic effects;40Ledum palustre was prescribed for two patients in our trial. Conclusion In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 58 patients suffering from HU, IHMs produced a signi cantly greater effect than placebo in reducing SUA levels and improving patients 'quality of life.
