In the United States, medical organizations \u2014 from the [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-cdc-ad-council-urge-flu-vaccination-amid-covid-19-pandemic) to the [American Academy of Family Physicians](https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/prevention-wellness/immunizations-vaccines/disease-pop-immunization/influenza.html) to the [American Hospital Association](https://www.aha.org/ahia/promoting-healthy-communities/united-against-flu) \u2014 almost universally recommend the flu vaccine to everyone over the age of 6 months. Yet only about half of American adults typically get an annual flu vaccine, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm). Even during the 2022-2023 flu season, when health officials and doctors sounded the alarm about a potential \"tripledemic\" of [influenza](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/), [COVID-19](https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/covid-19/), and [RSV](https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/what-is-rsv-respiratory-syncytial-virus/), only 55 percent of adults got a [flu shot](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/shot/), according to the [CDC's preliminary estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html#:~:text=Coverage%20as%20of%20April%2015,%25%3B%20national%20coverage%20is%2055.1%25.). Among the reasons that people don't get vaccinated for the flu is an unfounded fear that the shot might actually give them the flu, says [Jennifer Horney, PhD](https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/experts/jennifer-horney/), director of the epidemiology program at the University of Delaware in Newark. \"This is a [widespread myth](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/myths-you-should-stop-believing/),\" she says. \"While some vaccines \u2014 for example, the chicken pox vaccine \u2014 contain a weakened live virus to stimulate an immune response, the [influenza](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/) vaccine [with the exception of the nasal spray form] is an inactivated vaccine made with viruses that have been killed and are therefore not infectious.\" Though the nasal mist version of the flu vaccine does contain live viruses, they are so weakened (attenuated) that the spray form will not cause illness, states the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm). Will the Flu Shot Make You Sick? Side Effects of the Flu Shot Are Nothing Compared With Flu Sickness Many people are also concerned that the possible side effects of the [flu shot](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/shot/) could be worse than [getting the flu itself](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/how-long-does-the-flu-last/), notes Horney. \"The potential risks of a severe case of [influenza](/flu/guide/) far outweigh any very limited risk of side effects [from the vaccine], which are typically mild,\" she says. Some people equate the flu with having a bad cold. While [the flu and the common cold](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/) have some symptoms in common, the flu can knock people flat for a few days to as long as two weeks, and it can also have far more dire consequences. Some people who get the flu will develop complications such as [pneumonia](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pneumonia/guide/), inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), or respiratory failure, which can lead to hospitalization and death, notes the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/symptoms.htm). \"Even if you've been vaccinated and still get the flu, you are less likely to die, be hospitalized, or be admitted to the ICU,\" Horney says. While incidence of the flu was unusually low during the early part of the [COVID-19 pandemic](/infectious-diseases/covid-19/), thanks to precautions like mandatory masking and stay-at-home orders, the [CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm) that the 2022-2023 flu season led to anywhere from 290,000 to 640,000 flu hospitalizations and from 19,000 to 57,000 flu deaths. What Are the Main Side Effects of the Flu Shot? [The CDC lists](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/flushot.htm) the following common side effects that people may experience from getting a [flu shot](/flu/guide/shot/): - Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given - Headache - Fever - Nausea - Muscle aches If these reactions occur, they usually begin soon after vaccination and last one to two days. \"You can have a sore arm, feel a little achy for a day or two, and maybe have a low-grade fever as your immune system gets turned on,\" says [James Conway, MD,](https://ghi.wisc.edu/staff/james-conway/) a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. \"If so, take some [Tylenol](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/tylenol) or some [ibuprofen](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/ibuprofen) and ride it out \u2014 it's a small inconvenience and certainly well worth the protection from what could be a potentially devastating disease,\" he adds. Another occasional reaction to be aware of is fainting; a handful of people may temporarily lose consciousness after getting any type of vaccination. 7 Flu Shot Myths You Should Stop Believing Can People Have an Allergic Reaction to the Flu Shot? A flu immunization may produce an [allergic reaction](https://www.everydayhealth.com/allergies/), but instances of this are very rare, and effective treatments can quickly resolve any trouble. Most vaccines are developed from chicken eggs. The [CDC cautions](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/quadrivalent.htm) that people who have a history of a severe egg allergy (usually meaning symptoms other than [hives](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hives/) after exposure to an egg) should be vaccinated in a medical setting, supervised by a healthcare provider who is able to recognize and manage severe [allergic reactions](/allergies/). Two completely egg-free flu [vaccine options](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/understanding-flu-vaccines-and-picking-the-right-type-for-you/) were widely available during the 2022-2023 flu season \u2014 the quadrivalent recombinant vaccine and the quadrivalent cell-based vaccine. Should People Who Are Immunocompromised Get a Flu Shot? Another misconception is that individuals with chronic conditions who may be immunocompromised may have a worse reaction to the vaccine because they are more vulnerable. Health officials say this is not so. \"When we say that the vaccine is universally recommended for ages 6 months and above, we mean it,\" says Dr. Conway. \"The only group that should absolutely not get it again would be somebody with a genuine [allergic reaction](https://www.everydayhealth.com/allergies/) to the vaccine \u2014 obviously, they should avoid it.\" \"Older people and people with underlying conditions should really even be higher priority than others to get the flu vaccine,\" says [Dean Winslow, MD](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/w/dean-winslow.html), an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in California. The fact is, the flu can be much more disastrous for these high-risk populations. People with asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and a number of other chronic health conditions are at a higher risk of developing [serious flu complications](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/complications/) that can result in hospitalization or even death, per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/chronic-conditions/index.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu%2Fhighrisk%2Fchronic-conditions.htm). Indeed, during recent flu seasons, 9 out of 10 people hospitalized with the flu had at least one underlying health condition, the agency notes. Being pregnant also puts you at an increased risk of more severe illness from the flu. This is due to changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs that occur during pregnancy (and last up to two weeks postpartum). \"We definitely recommend as a general rule that all pregnant women should be vaccinated,\" says Dr. Winslow. \"There's no risk to the mother or the fetus.\" He adds, \"Some pregnant women who have contracted the flu have been severely affected and died.\" The flu vaccine offers protection against the flu to both the mother and the baby. Can the Flu Shot Trigger a Harmful Immune Reaction? Although it's an extremely uncommon reaction to the flu vaccine, a very small number of individuals may develop [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/guillain-barre-syndrome/guide/), a rare disorder in which the body's immune system attacks nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. [The CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/general.htm#side-effects) estimates that the risk of [GBS](https://www.everydayhealth.com/guillain-barre-syndrome/guide/) after vaccination is fewer than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. \"It's incredibly rare, so it's not something that I worry about,\" says [Ann Philbrick, PharmD](https://www.pharmacy.umn.edu/our-faculty-staff/our-faculty/ann-philbrick), an associate professor at the University of Minnesota's College of Pharmacy in Minneapolis. \"But it can be a paralyzing disease, so it is certainly something severe enough to mention.\" [The Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793) notes that most people recover from [GBS](/guillain-barre-syndrome/guide/), and several treatments can ease symptoms and reduce the duration of the illness. The mortality rate is between 4 and 7 percent. GBS can also occur after illness from the flu itself, the CDC notes. And, although it is also very rare, GBS is more common following flu illness than flu vaccination. Ultimately, the potential side effects of a flu shot are nothing compared with the damage the virus itself can inflict. \"Respiratory viruses like flu and COVID can really do a number on society,\" says Conway. \"Anything we can do to maintain community immunity and prevent any unnecessary death and destruction is really important.\" Additional "}
