There are so many detoxification methods, and we're sharing our favorites here. While many detox regimes focus only on the body, the mind and spirit are just as important. In this article, we're going to share our best tips for how to detox your body, mind, and spirit. How to Detox Your Body, Mind & Spirit From crystal healing to toxic relationships, these tips will help you begin the new year on a healthy note, prioritizing your well-being and outlook for the year ahead. Let's dig right in... Smudging [Smudging](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/how-to-smudge-with-sage-palo-santo) is one of the oldest and most effective ways to detox a living space. Burning [sage](https://cosmiccuts.com/products/sage-energy-cleansing-set-smudging-abalone-shell-holy-wood) is not only healing, but research shows it also benefits physical, mental and emotional well-being. It cleanses the area of negative energy and improves sleep quality by combatting insomnia. Burning this herb will help positivity to enter any office or living space.

Drink Lots of Water Water is essential to detoxification, working to flush toxins and waste out of the body. It assists our bodies in transporting nutrients, helping the colon and [kidneys](https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-cleanse#:~:text=It's%20crucial%20to%20drink%20enough,to%20the%20Institute%20of%20Medicine.) eliminate waste and toxins. When experts share their tips on how to detox your body, they typically recommend drinking 8-10 glasses of water daily. Water will help with constipation and eliminating water-soluble toxins. Switch Off Devices & Read Something Inspirational Phones, computers and even e-readers affect our health, according to [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1232.short). \"Blue light\" screens interfere with our brains' production of melatonin, delaying our natural cycle. Even e-readers can affect our quality of sleep. Checking our phones and computers distracts us from getting quality sleep or relaxation. Additionally, binge-watching TV has been shown to cause cognitive decline. [Researchers](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/binge-watching-tv-can-dull-your-brain#How-can-watching-TV-cause-cognitive-decline?-) found that \"watching television for more than 3.5 hours per day may also take up time that could be spent on other cognitively beneficial activities, such as playing board games and reading.\" On the other hand, the [benefits](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books#takeaway) of reading books include improved brain connectivity, greater empathy, increased vocabulary and comprehension. Reading books also helps reduce stress, and lowers blood pressure and heart rate, contributing to a longer life. Exercise Exercise aids detoxification because it helps our lungs to function optimally. Drinking plenty of water and exercising keeps our bodies healthy, supporting us in [eliminating toxins naturally](https://www.today.com/health/can-exercise-detox-your-body-its-not-about-sweat-1C7634616). We also release toxins through our sweat, so a good workout that makes you sweat is an effective detoxification method. Additionally, exercise improves memory and brain function for all age groups. Regular exercise protects us against disease, lowers blood pressure and increases our life span. It can also reduce joint pain and stiffness, maintaining muscle strength and balance. Eat More Whole Foods Overloading our bodies with junk food, alcohol, sugar, and dairy puts stress on our bodies. Holiday eating can put a lot of pressure on our bodies, contributing to overall body toxicity. Eating more whole foods will not only help [reduce inflammation](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/ways-to-reduce-inflammation) and sluggishness, it will also increase our energy levels. As a rule, most detoxes last 7-14 days. Learn how to detox your body and make [whole foods](https://www.thespruceeats.com/gentle-body-cleansing-primer-2254421) an ongoing lifestyle change. Reduce Chemicals Used Harmful chemicals like parabens are in beauty products, skincare, and shampoo. [Research](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/hair-products-harmful-ingredients-explained-parabens-sulfates-chemicals-a8395561.html) has uncovered links between beauty products and breast cancer, due to xenoestrogens. Look for \"paraben-free\" and labels to reduce the amount of chemicals used. Additionally, many of the fragranced products we use contain unlisted chemicals in their ingredients. Detergents, cleaners and air fresheners emit harmful VOCs or Volatile Organic Compounds. Look for \"phthalate-free\" products to avoid toxins from fragrances. Learn how to detox your body with [homemade cleaners](https://thegreenparent.co.uk/articles/read/make-your-own-cleaning-products) to improve asthma, allergies and eczema. Reduce EMF Radiation Microwaves and electronics emit radiation in the form of electromagnetic frequecnies (EMFs). It is vital we power down at night and charge our cellular devices on airplane mode. Keep all wireless devices out of the [bedroom](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/feng-shui-for-the-bedroom) and avoid carrying these devices near the body. If possible, use the speakerphone setting to reduce the amount of time holding a device. Carry [EMF protection crystals](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/emf-protection-crystals?_pos=3&_sid=22794e448&_ss=r) with you and place them around your home and office to reduce [EMF symptoms](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/emf-symptoms) as you go about your day. Declutter Office & Living Spaces Whether we are decluttering our home, [office](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/feng-shui-for-the-office) or car, clearing out our space improves our energy and boosts our confidence as we utilize our decision-making and problem-solving skills. With [evolution](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/in-practice/201802/6-benefits-uncluttered-space), human beings developed a preference for order and symmetry. When things feel out of place, we may feel scattered or anxious. Tidying our space relieves anxiety and stress, but it also frees up the energy in our environment. That frees up our own personal energy, making us feel lighter and more free. That's why it is the ultimate detox. End Toxic Relationships [Dysfunctional relationships](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/5-ways-to-detoxify-from-a_b_7008100?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHyHTv_qys2oNNN6ZA1Xlk-1qiho7YWbEvOsfbnH6je2VXM0t-iePWwghWuwGO0jjEvKLeZdwVPmKcdB1Iv0N2s35-avCXdf4hKiDdbpcE-S76LF0Toik2u_7Z0CV1r7TPaX7Q6UkdDMU2Pk8UPeQI1U1EDSEPIC4jg-i_scqcxM) adversely affect our body, mind and spirit. Toxic relationships greatly damage our wellbeing. This is why it is important to learn to detach from unhealthy relationships, people, and situations. Ending a toxic relationship cleanses the toxicity of a dysfunctional dynamic, restoring our inner peace and emotional balance. While ending a toxic [friendship](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/crystals-for-friendship), partnership, or love connection may be difficult at first, there are steps we can take to make it easier, like repeating [daily reaffirmations](https://psychcentral.com/blog/you-deplete-me-10-steps-to-end-a-toxic-relationship/). Spend Time in Nature Spending time in nature is excellent for detoxification. Walking in the park or camping is beneficial for our health, helping us recover from addiction or burnout. Science shows nature is good for our physical and mental health. One [Japanese study](https://www.detoxcentercolorado.com/4-ways-spending-time-in-nature-strengthens-your-recovery/) found that walking in nature lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol, pulse rates, and blood pressure. It also revealed \"greater parasympathetic nerve activity, and lower sympathetic nerve activity.\" Take a Break From Social Media Social media has come to be an important aspect of our lives. While apps like Facebook and Instagram help us stay in touch with loved ones and inspire us, taking a break from social media will benefit our health. It is one of the best ways to detox. Scrolling though different feeds leaves many of us feeling anxious, drained and unhappy. Whether we take a temporary holiday from social media or a permanent break, these [social media detox tips](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/g30681374/social-media-detox-tips/) can help. Meditate Mediation eases depression, boosts cognitive function, and reduces stress and anxious feelings. It also helps us address negative thought patterns and attachments, which improves our physical chemistry and body.
