Urban, immunomodulatory, pegaga Introduction Recently, infectious diseases have highest concern for healthcare providing organizations, mainly in developing countries. 'Emerging infectious diseases' (EIDs) is defined as a cluster of diseases which have occurred previously orfirst time introduced in a population that is rapidly increasing in prevalence or geographic range. 1 The study by Church (2004) had been shown that the causes of EIDswere highly associated with changes in human behavior, global population and environmental. There are majorly managed by preventive measures including vaccinationprograms and using suitable antibiotics to treat existence diseases. 2 However, antibiotic has many serious adverse effects like bone marrow suppressing effects, drugresistances, tolerance, allergic reactions and removing normal flora bacteria in body. In addition, it causes tissue damage due to extended consumption which producestoxic reactive oxygen species and also interfered with the normal body's immune system and reduced immuneresponse towards specific antigen. 3 Thus, it is better to provide other alternative from natural products that acts as anti-microbial or strengthen the normal body's immunedefense system for managing microbial infection instead of using modern synthetic agents. The immune system is important to human health as it functions to protect body from invading pathogens and treat the existence of diseases. 4 Even a minor infection will produce seriously bad effects when the host immunesystem is defected. Instead of that, the progression of abnormal condition such a cancer is believed to initiate by alteration of host's immune system. One of the ways inreducing this problem is to modify the host's immune responses by increasing the capability of this system in preventing or eliminating the etiologic agents that causeddiseases. 5 The use of a variety of agents is aimed to modulate immunological parameters which includes non- specific host defenses, humoral antibody or cell-mediatedimmune responses that required to control numerous of diseases. 6 The modification of immune responses that function to up and down the immune alertness to treatdiseases is known as immunomodulation. 7 The use of immunomodulators for either as a prevention or treatment of various diseases that related with defective immune*Author for correspondence Nurul Hikmah Harun, School of No. 2, 2019 93 responses became the focus of major attention since a long times ago.8 The main objectives of immunomodulators are either to enhance immune responses that applied ininfectious and immunodeficiency diseases or to suppress them as a treatment for inflammation and autoimmune diseases. 9 Besides, the use of immunostimulant also im- portant as an adjuvant to chemotherapy for various diseases.10 Natural products which originated from plants, fungal, bacterial and marine animal sources offer a large clusterof various chemical entities with a numerous of phar- macological activities and lesser number of side effects against synthetic medicinal agents. In 2013, US Food andDrug Administration approved approximately 1453 new chemical entities that have been isolated from natural products. 11 One of the well-known natural products belongs to the group of medicinal plants and herbs which are rich in bioactive compounds and beneficial for human health. There're a great interest of scientists into these groups ofnatural products, because of the modern therapeutic medi- cines that are associated with adverse side effects and are costly to purchase in comparison with herbal products.They also have been widely used as medications, nutritive products, and health supplements since prehistoric times. 12 Many such preparations from medicinal plants have been reported as a medicines to improve body immune content in flavonoids, triterpene glycosides, vitamin C or carotenoids immune functions. 13,14 Centella asiatica (Linn.) Urban is derived from family Umbelliferae. The taxonomy of C. asiatica is listed in Table 1. Their derivatives have been used as a traditional herbal medicine in Malaysia and other parts of Asia for hundreds of years. This plant is traditionally used for anti-microbial, immune booster, wound healing and treatment of skin-related inflammatory conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. 15,16 Nowadays, C. asiatica has attracted significant research and commercial interests due to its health-promoting bioactive compounds.17 Based on the previous studies, the biological activities of C. asiatica have been accounted due to the presence of pentacyclic triterpene acids in the leaves (asiatic acid and madecassic acid) and their respective glycosides (asiaticoside andmadecassoside). Almost of the phytochemical studies were concentrated on leaves and the components are differ depending upon the geographical distribution. 18 Under this background the present work was carried out to review the anti-microbial and immunomodulatory activities of extract and bioactive compounds derived from C. asiatica .Plant properties C. asiatica is a creeping, perennial and slender trailing herb. It has reddish prostrate stolons and long rooting at the nodes. Its' glabrous leaves with scalloped edges have reniform, entire, crenate which about 1.3 cm to 7 cm indiameter. 19 Flowers are white or light purple-to-pink in color which are covered by bracts. These flowers in quantity of 3 to 4 are clustered in an umbel.18 The small and compressed fruits contained 7 to 9 ridged and have sized of 8 mm long. The mericarps are rounded at the top and curved meanwhile the lateral seeds are compressed.20 Botanical synonyms and vernacular names Centella asiatica (Linn.) cochinchinensis Lour.21 Among communities, this plant is \"Bua-bok\" in Thailand.25 Some vernacular names of this plant are summarized in Table 2. Distribution C. asiatica is found almost all over the world. It is a native plant to warmer region countries of both North andSourth hemispheres including Africa, Asia, India, southern United States of America, Central America and South America, Australia, Venezuela and Madagascar. 26 The plant grows most abundant during rainy season mainly in marshy and dampy areas.23 Traditional uses Dried whole plant, leaves and stems are the most used part of C. asiatica for remedial purposes.18 In Malaysia and Indonesia, it is highly consumed and eaten raw as a salad or in different formulas including capsule, pill, teaand juice. Sometimes, the Malaysian peoples prepared and served it with sweet potato and coconut milk to reduce its' bitterness and the fresh leaf also is eaten toincrease lactation after birth. 27,28 In numerous region of the world, C. asiatica is used to increase health. Chinese and Thai people always used this plant as a drinking water for thirst reducing purpose and as a cooling agent.15 In Southeast countries in Asia, it is traditionally used for the treatment of variety of illnesses such as rheumatism, epilepsy, hysteria, dehydration, inflammation, syphilis,mental illness, skin diseases and diarrhoea. 16 Centella asiatica : Anti-microbial activities Antibiotic resistant has been a great concern of health problem throughout the world. During the last decades,development of drug resistance has significantly increased due to the widespread usage of antibiotics. On the other hand, the resistant may be also due to the ability ofbacteria to quickly adapt to their environmental changes. As a result, this incidence has led to emergence of various illnesses and it is important to find a new anti-bacterialagent from other alternative sources. Recently, natural products have been important source of medicinal properties in the scope of anti-microbial. Currently, medicinal plantsare still used by up to 80% of population worldwide particularly in developing countries for the treatment and prevention of diseases. C. asiatica is one of the essential medicinal plants which commonly used in traditionally forthe treatment of several ailments including infectious diseases. Therefore, to support the statement, the anti- microbial activities of C. asiatica against various human pathogens are emphasized in Table 3. Preliminary study using disc diffusion method presented that the ethanol extracts of C. asiatica had anti-bacterial activities against human pathogenic bacteria such as Proteus vulgaris , Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli . In this research, ethanol extract of C. asiatica exhibited anti-bacterial activities with average of inhibition zone were 16 to 19 mm. 29 Moreover, the similar extract of C. asiatica has been reported to possess broad inhibition of spectrum activities against Shigella species, Vibrio cholera, and S. aureus . Punch well and agar dilution methods were used to determine this anti-bacterial activities and the result showed that the ethanol extract at a concentration of 400 mg/mL inhibited most significant inhibitory properties against those bacteria. 30 The ethanol extract of C. asiatica was also effective against the Gram-negative bacteria. On the basis of disc diffusion method , four different concentrations (100, 200, 300 and 400 \u00b5g/disc) were used to observe anti-bacterial activity of C. asiatica . According to this study, mild anti- bacterial activity was also noted against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with average inhibition zone was 6 mm, compared to the standard drug.31 Susceptibility test of anti-bacterial agent is performed by determining its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using brothmicro-dilution and followed by quantifying a minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Using a modified resazurin microtiter plate to determine MIC value andcontinued by quantifying MBC by mannitol salt agar, the other research reported that the ethanol extract of C. asiatica had strong anti-bacterial activity against isolated S. aureus from milk samples of dairy cows with MIC and MBC values of 8 and 16 mg/mL respectively. 32 It has been known, under certain environment, bacteria havetheir defensive mechanism which allows them to survive. Based on the previous study which using two types of bacteria that able to survive in high osmotic stress such asBacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes , the ethanol extract of C. asiatica showed strong anti-bacterial activities with MIC values of 16 and 8 \u00b5g/mL, and MBCvalues of 16 and more than 32 \u00b5g/mL independently. 33 Furthermore, C. asiatica also demonstrated its activity against resistant bacteria. Zaidan and team reported thatC. asiatica showed anti-bacterial activity against Gram- positive and Gram-negative bacteria by standard disc diffusion method. Furthermore, using MIC to verify itssusceptibility, 1 000 g/disc of methanol extract of C.Vol. 25, No. 2, 2019 95Table 3.

QS is a phenomenon in which bacteria able to converse via secreted signaling molecules called auto-inducers, which regulate the expression of particular genes. This process is involved in controlling gene expression responsible for bacterial physiological functionincluding biofilm formation as well as virulence factor production. Thus, disruption of QS has been proposed as a new anti-infective strategy. It has been reported that richflavonoid extract of C. asiatica showed its ability in disruption of QS in P . aeruginosa . The extract was able to inhibit violacein production without affecting bacterialgrowth. The ethanol extract of C. asiatica exhibited anti- QS in Chromobacterium violaceum \u00b5g/disc demonstrated violacein inhibitionwith the 22 mm pigmentless zone. C. asiatica was also able to inhibit QS-regulated production of violacein production in C. violaceum CV026. The extract at con- centration of 300 \u00b5g/disc inhibited violacein production completely. Further experiment was performed to determine the effect of C. asiatica on N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) in C. violaceum . The outcome revealed that the ethanol extract of C. asiatica (100 - 400 \u00b5g/mL) enabled to inhibit AHL-mediated violacein production in a con- centration-dependent manner. This extract also demonstratedinhibition of QS phenotypes including pyocyanin pro- duction as well as biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a similar pattern. The extract at 400 \u00b5g/mL completely inhibited pyocyanin production, biofilm pro- duction as well as elastolytic and proteolytic activity in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Moreover, the ethanol extract of C. asiatica (50 \u00b5g/mL) also inhibited swarming motility of P. aeruginosa PAO1. These findings indicated that C. asiatica is not only directly active towards suspected bacteria, butalso effective in disrupting mechanism involved in bacteria defensive system, including QS. 35 Superficial fungal infection has also contributed in increasing public health problem. The commensal microbes, including Candida albicans able to cause systemic infection in human. The incidence of candida infectionhas significantly increased mainly in immunocompromised patients. According to a previous work, anti-fungal activity of C. asiatica has also been reported. Study by Singh and team using spore germination assay, six different concentrations (1000 - 10000 \u00b5g/mL) were used to determine the anti-fungal activity of the methanol extract of C. asiatica . The findings showed that the extract at 5000 \u00b5g/mL completely inhibited the spore germination of Fusarium udum , Dreschslera monoceras. Besides, this extract significantly enabled to inhibit the growth of testedfungi such as F . udum . Additionally, the synergistic effect also detected when the extract combined with Andrographis paniculata . 36 Dash and team who used disc diffusion method, presented strong anti-fungal activity against Aspergillus niger with the inhibition zone were 16 and 14 mm respectively aftertreated with ethanol and petroleum ether extract. In case of C. albicans , the ethanol and chloroform extracts demonstrated strong activity with inhibition zone of 15mm. All these results assumed that the ethanol extract had strong anti-fungal activity against A. niger and C. albicans which are comparable to ketocanozole as a positivecontrol. 29 Separately, screening of anti-fungal activity against some important seed borne fungi including Aspergillus aqueous extract of C. asiatica had satisfied activity in inhibiting those fungi with MICs in the range of 80 to 90%.37 C. asiatica herb is one of recommended plant that useful for the treatment of dermatological disease. This plant also has important activity in facilitating wound healingprocess in vitro and in vivo . 38,39 Recently, nanoparticle has attracted interest of many researcher due to its promising area for development of pharmaceutical product. Various techniques such as physical and chemical have beenproposed to synthesize silver nanoparticle. However, the use of chemical as a reducing and stabilizing agents may lead to increase of toxic and hazard in environment.Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using natural products has provided outstanding prospect to reduce the use of chemical agents. In addition, green synthesis usingplant as reducing agents also provides increasing its pharmacological activities due to the synergistic interaction between natural product and silver itself. According to theprevious work, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) had been successfully synthesized using callus of C. asiatica . Further study found that synthesized AgNPs had a stronganti-bacterial activity which was comparable to the positive control. After 24 hours incubation period, the inhibition zone was appeared on a sterile disc paperimpregnated with silver nanoparticle. The results showed that AgNPs had strong anti-bacterial activity against S. aureus , B. subtilis , E. coli and P. aeruginosa with inhibition zone of 21.3, 19.4, 16.2 and 18.8 mm, respectively. 40 Another study also recorded that synthesized AgNPstrough green synthesis using C. asiatica extract performed an anti-bacterial activity against S. aureus . AgNPs exhibitedVol. 25, No. 2, 2019 97 anti-bacterial activity against tested bacteria with MIC value of 7.4 lg/mL.41 These results indicated that C. asiatica along with other substance as well as the plants itself havea potent anti-bacterial activity against various human pathogens. Moreover, C. asiatica contained numerous of secondary metabolic compounds which have various pharmacological properties including anti-microbial. Asiatic acid is one of a major phytochemical compound contained in the plants.Study by Liu and team illustrated that asiatic acid had satisfactory broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It was acid anti-bacterial activity against Enterococcus a Gram-positive bacteria and E. coli , Gram-negative bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 20 and 32 \u00b5g/mL and 24 and 36 \u00b5g/mL, re- spectively. Further investigation was performed to confirm the anti-bacterial action of this compound and theresults showed that treated bacteria with asiatic acid at concentration of two-fold higher than its MIC value lead to alter membrane integrity. In addition, this similardosage increased the release of potassium ions as well as protein in treated bacteria. 42 Besides, asiatic acid and ursolic acid from C asiatica had a potent anti-bacterial activity against clinical uropathogenic E. coli . These compounds showed the anti-bacterial activity with MIC values in the range of 512 to 1024 \u00b5g/mL. Moreover, both of these compounds were able to reduce productionof virulence factor. Asiatic acid and ursolic acid at 50 \u00b5g/ mL inhibited virulence factors of E. coli , including P- fimbriae, curli fibres and alpha-hemolysin. From thisstudy, reduction of bacterial motility was also recorded. 43 Furthermore, C. asiatica are also important source of essential oil. Oyedeji and Afolayan have isolated volatileoil from this plant and further conducted the anti-bacterial properties testing using microplate dilution method. The findings showed that essential oil from C. asiatica exhibited strong anti-bacterial activity against wide range of bacterial, including B. subtilis , S. aureus , E. coli , P. aeruginosa and S. sonnei with MIC values in the range of 0.039 to 1.25 \u00b5g/mL. These results illustrated the broad spectrum anti-bacterial effects of essential oil from C. asiatica . 44 Centella asiatica : Immunomodulatory activities Immunomodulator is a constituent which able to enhance or regulates the immune system comprising both innate and adaptive immune responses. Recently, variousmedicinal plant products have become a subject forscientific investigation to modulate immune system. The immune system is a basic defense system of the body against foreign substances and pathogens. Its purpose is toeliminate foreign substances from attacking the body and initiating numerous diseases. 45 The immunomodulatory activites of C. asiatica extract were being studied by various researchers in-vitro and in- vivo assays. The immunomodulatory activities of crude extracts and isolated fractions and bioactive compoundsderived from C. asiatica have been depicted in Table 4. The preliminary study by Mali and Hatapakki identified that various concentrations of ethanolic leaves extract ofC. asiatica 25, 50 and 100 mg/mL significantly increased migration activities of neutrophil cells from the upper compartment to lower surface of filter in a dosedependent manner. The similar effect of extracts on phagocytosis activities of neutrophils which was evaluated by slide method showed that the extracts also enhancedthe phagocytic index of neutrophil cells when compared to the untreated group. Next, the intracellular killing properties of neutrophils that treated with these variousextract concentrations indicated more higher than negative control samples containing phosphate buffer saline solution when measured using qualitative nitroblue tetra-zolium test. 46 The other study by Pandiyan and team which used rabbit erythrocytes as an in vitro model presented that whole plants aqueous extract of C. asiatica at concentration of 15.63 to 1000 g/mL significantly increased alternative pathway (AP) activity in a dose response relationship when compared to levamisole as a positive control. TheAP 50 of this extract presented the value of 617.02 \u00b1 16.40 g/mL. In theory, alternative pathway of complement system that consists of soluble plasma proteins hasdistinct benefits of innate immunity against invading microbes. The immune response that involved in this pathway is rapid but does not contained immunologicalmemory. Therefore, agent capable of stimulating alternative pathway selectively could be a better choice to apply as an adjuvant in the antibiotic therapy to treat infectiousdiseases. 3 Futhermore, there were also numerous in-vivo studies determined the immunomodulatory effects of this medicinalplant. The study by Jayathirtha and Mishra seeks to discover immunized Swiss albino mice with sheep red blood cell suspension as a model showed that themethanolic extract of whole part of C. asiatica at high dose (500 mg/kg body weight (BW)) presented the significant increasing number in the total white bloodcount in treated-mice when compared to negative controlVol. 25, No. 2, 2019 98Table 4.

Meanwhile, the effects of extracts on a phagocytic activity of treated mice had been measured by carbonclearance test. The findings exhibited that all the various concentrations of extract significantly elicited the phagocytic index of treated mice in a dose-dependent manner.However, there was no significant increase in the level of antibody production in any group of mice treated with C. asiatica extract. 47 In addition, research done by Punturee and groups mentioned that aqueous extract of C. asiatica increased the production of primary immunoglobulin M (IgM) andsecondary immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses of immunized mice. Meanwhile, for in-vitro study involved water extract of C. asiatica extract significantly increased lymphocyte proliferation induced by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) in a dose-response manner and only slightly increased lymphocyte proliferation induced byphytohemagglutinin (PHA) after 72 hours incubation period. Besides, water extract of C. asiatica at high con- centration (500 \u00b5g/mL) increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha well (PHA)-stimulated inter- leukin-2 (IL-2) when measured using enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. 48 The in-vivo investigation by Trapika and colleagues revealed that ethanol extract of C. asiatica leaves at dose of 50 and 150 mg/kg BW having immunostimulant potency by increasing interferon gamma (IFN-) secretions in the spleen of Balb/C mice infected by Listeria monocytogenes when compared to the untreated group that only receiveddistill water. The measurement of IFN- level was using ELISA sandwich method. The action of this extracts might be due to the ability of the bioactive compounds inthis plant extract able to modulate other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) that influenced the secretion ofIFN- from natural killer cells when infection occurred. 49 Moreover, in-vivo exploration by Besung and team who were using mice infected by Salmonella typhi as a model discovered that leaves methanolic extract of C. asiatica leaves (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg BW) enhanced phagocytic capacity of macrophages at dose responserelationship. The highest phagocytic value of macrophages was observed after treatment with concentration of 500 mg/kg BW which presented 209.12 \u00b1 26.17 cells per 50macrophage compared with untreated mice (103.12 \u00b1 5.11). The morphological observations using Giemsa stained cells were done through 1000x total magnificationof light microscope to compare between macrophage oftreated and untreated groups. The outcomes showed that the macrophage treated with C. asiatica extract having irregular shapes, eccentric location of horseshoe-shapednucleus and a lot of vesicle and vacuole of lysosomes. Meanwhile, the morphology of untreated macrophage cells appear small and having regular shapes. 50 Application of pulverized C. asiatica combination (0.5%, 1% or 2%) with conventional diet in crossbred pigs exhibited comparable levels of serum interleukin-10(IL-10) to control. In addition, 1% and 2% C. asiatica revealed significantly reduced serum IFN- levels when compared with untreated group after one monthtreatment. However, pigs fed with 1% and 2% C. asiatica showed significantly decreased serum IL-10 but not significantly in serum IFN- levels at three months priortreatment. The results indicate that C. asiatica has the potential to inhibit both pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory activities in crossbred pigs. 51 Siddiqui and his group were using immunized Swiss albino mice (20 - 25 g) with sheep red blood cells as a research model to evaluate the immunomodulatory activities of ethanolextract of aerial part C. asiatica at concentration of 100 mg/kg BW. Blood samples were collected from the retro- orbital plexus of each animal on day 10 and 14 aftersensitization with sheep red blood cell (SRBC) on day 7.The findings showed that haemagglutination titre value in treatment group was significantly induced after 14 days treatment when compared to control group. The findingssuggested that the extract able to enhance humoral antibody responses in immunized mice. 52 C. asiatica contained abundant of bioactive fractions and compounds which have various pharmacological properties including immunomodulatory activities. The activity of madecassic acid on CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes subpopulations in tumor-bearing mice was studied by Zhang and friends using flow cytometry analysis. The findings revealed that medacassic acidexhibited significantly increased of CD4+ and CD8+ T- of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN- and IL-4when compared to the untreated group. Thus, they suggested that the madecassic acid administration boosted the rat's immune defenses system against tumorigenesisvia both T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) mediated immune response. 53 Mahmood and team reported that the nitrite oxide (NO) production of LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells had shown an decreasing level after treatment with 40 and 80 \u00b5M asiatic acid. In contrast, at higher dose (160 \u00b5M), this compound exhibited thereverse phenomenon. NO released by macrophages was100 Natural Product Sciences detected using Griess assay.54 Inflammation is a normal physiology of our body's immune responses against infections. It includes thebody's defend itself against foreign intruders such as viruses and bacteria, effort to heal itself after an injury and repair damaged tissue. 55 However, excessive inflam- mation gives augmentation to tissue damage, functional impairment, discomfort and pain.56 C. asiatica also have an effect to modulate immune responses in variousinflammatory model studies. Yun and colleagues revealed the effect of asiaticoside and asiatic acid (30, 60 and 120 \u00b5M) isolated from the leaves of C. asiatica on LPS- stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The outcomes presented that asiatic acid dose-dependently reduced nitrite oxide and prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2) more potently when compared to asiaticoside. Next, the asiatic acid produced inhibitory activities in the production of pro- inflammatory cytokines of TNF-, IL-6 and IL-1 inLPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells in a dose dependent manner. Later, the molecular studies reported that this compound inhibited protein and mRNAexpression of inducible nitrite of inhibitor factor of kappa lightpolypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells subunit alpha (IB-) and inhibitor nuclear kappa-B kinase subunit beta and alpha (IKK-/). Th ey suggested that the anti- inflammatory properties of asiatic acid might be theresults inhibition of down-regulation activation due to inhibition of IKK and MAPkinase phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 cells. 57 The activities of the titrated extract of C. asiatica (TECA) in a phthalic anhydride l and LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were studied by Park and friends. This in-vivo studies exhibited a reduction in infiltration of inflammatory cells, mast cells and hyperkeratosis through histological analysis of ear and back skin of both groups of animal treated with 0.2% and 0.4% combination of PAand TECA. The of TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and IgE in animal samples also significantly declined after treatmentwith 0.4% combination of PA and TECA. Meanwhile, in- vitro study showed that TECA at concentration of 1, 2, 5 \u00b5g/mL potently inhibited nitrite oxide released level andexpression of iNOS, NF-B DNA binding activities in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. 58 According to another research on the effects of triterpenoid saponins fraction (TSF) of this herb whichapplied on the wound area of Wistar female rat for 7 consecutive days demonstrated that TSF treatment decreased the expression of IL-1 and NF-B butincreased the level of TNF- when compared with the level of these similar parameter in the wound tissue. 54 There was a research conducted includes both in-vitro and in-vivo investigations using LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 isolated of human normal gingival tissueand Male Sprague-Dawley rats (7 weeks old) induced periodontitis respectively. The methodology approaches by using ELISA and western blot to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines and protein expression levels respectively. The in-vitro findings validated that LPS- induced PGE 2, NO, IL-6, and IL-8 productions were significantly diminished by asiatic acid in a dose response manner after treating with compound at concentration of 25, 50 and 100 \u00b5M. Asiatic acid also reduced p65 NF-Bphosphorylation in the in-vivo study showed that LPS-induced NF-B activation was inhibited by asiatic acid treatment. 59 Based on the previous report, 20 mol/L asiatic acid significantly inhibited the mRNA expression levels of IL- 8, IL-6, IL-1, and TNF- in LPS-induced inflammatoryresponses in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) in- vitro. 60 In addition, another exploration on ethanolic, methanolic and aqueous extract of whole plant of C. asiatica at a concentration of 30 g/mL and both its' bioactive compounds (madecassoside and asiaticoside at \u00b5g/mL) suppressed the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-induced production of PGE 2 inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 in TPA-stimulated fibroblast cells.61 Despite of all the reports, there is still lack of data to offer verifications on immunomodulatory activity of this plant. Actually, adequate studies have not been performed on normal state model in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies regarding all parameters comprising pro-inflammatory cytokines, pro-inflammatory enzymes, proteins and genes expression. The assessment of the effects of pure com-pounds and fractions on the activity and gene expression of enzymes and cytokines involved in a normal model might be benecial to investigate the ability of this herbas a potential to boost body's immune system as an initial prevention against invading pathogens that cause various ailments. Conclusion The consequences of the outcomes from all theseVol. 25, No. 2, 2019 101 investigations suggest that Centella asiatica has a potential to be applied as a future anti-microbial and immunomodulator agent for developing new naturalbased pharmaceuticals to treat or prevent human pathogenic microorganisms that responsible to initiate diseases.
