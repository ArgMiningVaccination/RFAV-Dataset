Marketplace reported that Wolfe: - was exposed nearly 30 years ago for selling fake HIV cures in Toronto - is not a licensed practitioner - claims to have a \"doctorate of natural medicine\" - now peddles unproven and harmful treatments for everything from chronic pain to cancer - advertises in Canada and the United States - has built a burgeoning alternative health operation at a resort in Ixtapa, Mexico, offering questionable, costly procedures and devices that often cause egregious physical suffering - claims, without evidence, on his Facebook page, the CellSonic pulse machine he uses can \"shut cancer down with one treatment\" - promotes an aggressive massage technique he claims can heal a recently broken wrist - offers a \"Whole Life Coach Certification\" course, a nine-day event to teach people to \"deprogram\" themselves because, according to Wolfe, the root of all disease is negative emotion - espoused. in the course. conspiracies about COVID-19 and \"Big Pharma\" - promoted unfounded ways to fight tumors, such as using devices called a \"belly button massager\" and a \"clapper\" The provincial Ministry of Health in British Columbia, where Wolfe's address and business are registered, is quoted: - \"We encourage the public to contact the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons to [file a complaint](https://www.cpsbc.ca/)if they believe they have fallen victim to a fraudulent medical professional.\" - \"If any individuals believe Mr. Wolfe violated the Criminal Code of Canada during their interactions, the appropriate authority to submit a complaint to would be the police.\" [Szeto E and others.

CBC News, Jan 20, 2023] Fraudulent nursing diploma sellers indicted. Twenty-five people have been accused of participating in a wire-fraud scheme that created an illegal licensing and employment shortcut for aspiring nurses and poses serious danger to patients who are exposed to care from untrained nurses. Three recently unsealed indictments returned by a South Florida federal grand jury and two informations filed by federal prosecutors charge that the defendants engaged in a scheme to sell fraudulent nursing degree diplomas and transcripts obtained from accredited Florida-based nursing schools to individuals seeking licenses and jobs as registered nurses (RNs) and practical/vocational nurses (LPN/VNs). The bogus documents enabled purchasers to sit for the national nursing board exam and, after passing it, to obtain licenses and jobs as RNs and LPN/VNs. The overall scheme involved the distribution of more than 7,600 fake nursing diplomas issued by three South Florida-based nursing schools: Siena College in Broward County, Palm Beach School of Nursing in Palm Beach County, and Sacred Heart International Institute in Broward County. These schools are now closed. If convicted, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison.

Delaware Nurses Association press release, Jan 26, 2023] Consumers charged for unwanted supplements, beauty products to receive refunds. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced it is sending check payments totaling more than $973,000 to 17,064 people who lost money to NutraClick LLC. The company had automatically enrolled customers in unwanted membership programs for supplements and beauty products and misled them about when they had to cancel trial memberships to avoid monthly charges. In 2016, NutraClick agreed to settle [the FTC's complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/09/ftc-action-nutraclick-must-change-billing-practices) alleging it lured consumers with \"free\" samples of supplements and beauty products and then violated the law by charging them a recurring monthly fee without their consent. The settlement required NutraClick to disclose the terms of its recurring membership programs clearly and conspicuously going forward. In September 2020, [the FTC filed another complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2020/09/nutraclick-llc-pay-104-million-agree-negative-option-marketing-ban-settle-ftc-allegations-it) against the company, alleging it violated federal law and the 2016 settlement order by misleading consumers about when they had to cancel their free trial memberships to avoid monthly charges. The defendants agreed to pay $1.04 million for consumer refunds and are banned from such \"negative option marketing.\" In 2021, FTC actions led to more than $472 million in refunds to consumers across the country, but these refunds were the result of cases resolved before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the FTC lacks authority to seek monetary relief in federal court. The FTC no longer has its strongest tool to provide refunds to consumers harmed by deceptive and unfair conduct.

Twenty-five people have been accused of participating in a wire-fraud scheme that created an illegal licensing and employment shortcut for aspiring nurses.

The bogus documents enabled purchasers to sit for the national nursing board exam and, after passing it, to obtain licenses and jobs as RNs and LPN/VNs. The overall scheme involved the distribution of more than 7,600 fake nursing diplomas issued by three South Florida-based nursing schools: Siena College in Broward County, Palm Beach School of Nursing in Palm Beach County, and Sacred Heart International Institute in Broward County. These schools are now closed [1]. The scheme was investigated by FBI Miami and HHS-OIG Miami with help from Homeland Security Investigations, Miami Field Office; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs-Office of Inspector General; United States Postal Inspection Service, Miami; and Florida Attorney General-Florida Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, Mid-Atlantic Field Office. Charges Related to Siena College The charging documents describe Siena College as a school licensed by the Florida Commission for Independent Education and the Florida Board of Nursing that offers a Practical Nursing Program and an RN to Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program. Eugene Sanon managed Siena College. The indictment charges defendants Stanton Witherspoon of Burlington County N.J.; Alfred Sellu of Burlington County N.J.; and Rene Bernadel of Westchester County, N.Y. with conspiring to commit and committing wire fraud [2]. The indictment alleges that the trio solicited and recruited individuals who sought nursing credentials to gain employment as an RN or LPN/VN. It is alleged that these defendants arranged with Sanon, who managed Siena College and is charged by information with wire fraud conspiracy, to create and distribute false and fraudulent diplomas and transcripts. These fake documents represented that the aspiring RN and LPN/VN candidates had attended Siena's nursing program and completed the necessary courses and clinicals to obtain RN or LPN/VN diplomas. In fact, the aspiring nurses never completed the necessary courses and clinicals. The information against Sanon alleges that he and others sold thousands of fake Siena College nursing diplomas and educational transcripts to people who used them to obtain RN or LPN/VN licenses in various states and nursing jobs with unwitting health care providers throughout the country [3]. Charges Related to Palm Beach School of Nursing According to the charging documents, Palm Beach School of Nursing's objective was to prepare students to meet Florida's licensing and nursing board requirements and become eligible to take the national licensing exam in order to work as registered nurses. The indictment charges Gail Russ of Broward County; Cheryl Stanley of Collier County, Fla.; Krystal Lopez of Palm Beach County; Ricky Riley of Broward County; Norberto Lopez of Palm Beach County; Damian Lopez of Palm Beach County; Francois Legagneur of County, N.Y.; Reynoso Seide of County, Cassandre Jean of Yelva Saint Preux County, N.Y.; Evangeline Naissant Rony Michel \"Yvrose Thompson,\" of Union County, N.J., with conspiring to commit, and committing, wire fraud. The indictment alleges that these defendants solicited and recruited individuals who sought nursing credentials to gain employment as an RN or LPN/VN. It is alleged that these recruiter defendants then arranged with Palm Beach School of Nursing's owner Johanah Napoleon and school employees Gail Russ, Cheryl Stanley, Krystal Lopez, and Ricky Riley to create and distribute false and fraudulent diplomas and transcripts representing that the aspiring RN and LPN/VN candidates had attended Palm Beach School of Nursing and completed the necessary courses and clinicals to obtain RN or LPN/VN diplomas. In fact, the aspiring nurses never completed the necessary courses and clinicals. The nursing applicants used the fake diplomas and transcripts they purchased from the owner and employees of Palm Beach School of Nursing to obtain RN or LPN/VN licenses in various states and nursing jobs with unwitting health care providers throughout the country [4]. In a related case, Napoleon was previously charged and has pled guilty to conspiring to commit health care fraud and wire fraud [5]. Charges Related to Sacred Heart International Institute The charging documents describe Sacred Heart International Institute as a Broward County School licensed by the Florida Board of Nursing that offered program designed to prepare students for employment as practical nurses. The indictment charges Ludnie Jean of Harris County, Texas; Serge Jean of Harris County, Texas; Simon Itaman of Harris County, Texas; Anna Itaman of Harris County, Texas; Rhomy Louis of Suffolk County, N.Y.; and Nadege Auguste of Broward County with conspiring to and committing wire fraud. It is alleged that these defendants solicited and recruited individuals who sought nursing credentials to gain employment as an LPN/VN. These recruiters then arranged with Charles Etienne, Sacred Heart's owner, to create and distribute false and fraudulent transcripts and diplomas representing that the aspiring candidates had attended Sacred Heart and completed the necessary courses and clinicals to obtain LPN/VN diplomas. The aspiring nurses never completed the necessary courses and clinicals. Etienne is charged by information with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The nursing candidates used the fake diplomas and transcripts they purchased from Sacred Heart to obtain LPN/VN licenses in various states and nursing jobs with unwitting health care providers throughout the country [7,8]. Danger Noted Government officials have pointed out that the scheme posed serious danger to patients who are exposed to care from untrained nurses: - Acting Special Agent in Charge Chad Yarbrough, FBI Miami, said: \"There are over 7,600 people around the country with fraudulent nursing credentials who are potentially in critical health care roles treating patients.\" [1] - Special Agent in Charge Omar P\u00e9rez Aybar of Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), said: \"The alleged selling and purchasing of nursing diplomas and transcripts to willing but unqualified individuals is a crime that potentially endangers the health and safety of patients and insults the honorable profession of nursing.\" [1] In November 2022, the Delaware Board of Nursing sent annulment letters to 26 people who had used one of the fake credentials to obtain a license [9]. The defendants face up to 20 years in prison if convicted [1].

In 1987, the American Chiropractic Association noted that advertising claims had been \"getting worse and worse\" and urged chiropractors to \"stop the garbage yellow page ads\" that contained coupons, offered free spinal x-rays, promised that there would no out-of pocket expense, or made exaggerated and unprofessional claims.

Eric Gandon, 58, who described himself as a naturopath, has been formally charged in a Tours, France, court with manslaughter, abuse of power, endangering the lives of others and falsely practicing as a doctor and pharmacist from July 2020 until January 2023. Gandon allegedly offered training courses for \"several hundred or even thousands of euros\" that consisted of \"not eating solid food for one to several weeks, without any medical follow-up being provided or planned.\" Gandon's victims included: - a 44-year-old woman who died during a course in 2021 that had been organized in a chateau in Noyant-de-Touraine (Indre-et-Loire) - a man in his sixties who was suffering from terminal cancer who died in 2020, one month after participating in a course organized in the Vend\u00e9e region in Western France. - a young woman who died in 2022 and had attended training courses the previous year while she was suffering from liver cancer and was in the process of discontinuing treatment Gandon claims on his website: - to have treated 4,000 people during the past 10 years - people are amazed by the body's ability to heal itself thanks to fasting and a healthy lifestyle including food hygiene and emotional hygiene - \"We want more and more people to discover the happiness and joy of living with a healthy mind in a healthy body. You too can change, slim down, prevent or regain good health, gain vitality, improve your relationships through fasting.\" Gandon's 25-year-old son, who participated in the training courses and the promotion of his father's methods via a YouTube channel, has also been charged with illegally practicing as a doctor and pharmacist. He was placed under judicial supervision with a ban on any activity related to fasting and naturopathy. He claims on a YouTube channel that patients who stop eating are able to \"feed on light.\" [Porter M.

In memoriam: Harriet Hall (1945-2023). Beginning with her first published article in 2003, Harriet \"SkepDoc\" Hall, M.D., gained a devoted following of scientists, health professionals, and consumers around the world who treasured her clarity, wisdom, wit, intellectual humility, and humanity. Her many writings, lectures, and other media appearances addressed a wide range of topics including pseudoscience, questionable health claims, quackery, \"alternative\" medicine, science-based medicine, controversial medical practices, and critical thinking. She was a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, an editorial board member and contributing editor of Skeptical Inquirer, a contributing editor of Skeptic, an advisor to the Quackwatch network, an overseas friend of Australia-based Friends of Science in Medicine, and an editorial review board member for the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database. On January 12, her husband Kirk Hall [announced](https://www.facebook.com/harriet.hall.52) on her Facebook page: I know Harriet's work was followed and admired by many of you. It is with great sadness that I must tell you my beloved wife passed away quietly and unexpectedly in her sleep last night. At this moment, she would probably simply ask you to have a kind thought for her, be kind to each other and continue to support her belief in the truth. Please take care. Many of Dr. Hall's activities are cataloged on her website, [skepdoc.info](https://www.skepdoc.info/), where her final articles will be posted over the next few days. The site's editorial team announced efforts will be made to make sure her work remains available. Most of her columns, articles, and book reviews, were published: - Weekly since January 2008 in the [Science-Based Medicine blog](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/author/harriet-hall/), where she was one of five founding editors - in [Skeptical Inquirer](https://skepticalinquirer.org/s/?post_types=post&_sft_authors=harriet-hall)magazine, including her \"Reality Is the Best Medicine\" columns published since the September/October 2018 issue [skepticalinquirer.org](http://skepticalinquirer.org/), where her monthly [SkepDoc's Corner](https://skepticalinquirer.org/category/skepdocs-corner/)columns have been published since September 2016, including some that were translated into Spanish by Alejandro Borgo of the Center for Inquiry, Argentina - in [Skeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/)magazine, including her column \"The SkepDoc,\" published in each issue since 2006 - in [eSkeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/), where she was a frequent contributor - at [Quackwatch](https://quackwatch.org/?s&_sft_authors=harriet-hall-md), where she served as a medical advisor From January through June of 2010, she wrote a brief column called \"The Health Inspector\" in O, The Oprah Magazine. In her [September 7, 2010 post at Science-Based Medicine](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/write-for-oprah-wrong-for-me/), she described how the magazine's editors made it a \"bizarre, frustrating experience\" for her, thwarting her efforts to \"make sure that at least my one little corner of the magazine was scientifically rigorous.\" In 2015, the [James Randi Educational Foundation](https://web.randi.org/educational-modules.html) released a free, 10-part video series of lectures by Dr. Hall on [\"Science-Based Medicine\"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8MfjLNsf_miVcNu6eJMNigAMNwQkk_B9) along with a [26-page downloadable course guide](https://web.randi.org/uploads/3/7/3/7/37377621/course_guide.pdf). Her 2008 book, [Women Aren't Supposed to Fly: The Memoirs of a Female Flight Surgeon](https://smile.amazon.com/Women-Arent-Supposed-Fly-Memoirs/dp/0595499589/ref=monarch_sidesheet) describes how she became a pilot and helped bring about equality for women in the U.S. Air Force. She retired in 1989 as a full colonel after serving for 20 years in the Air Force. In addition to practicing family medicine and flight medicine, she held administrative positions including Chief of Aerospace Medicine and Director of Base Medical Services. Additional details about her Air Force career are provided at [Science-Based Medicine](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/in-memoriam-dr-harriet-hall/). She co-authored the ninth edition of the college textbook Consumer Health: A Guide to Intelligent Decisions (2013). She was disappointed by its exorbitant price, typical of textbooks, and its unavailability in libraries put it out of reach of many of her readers. An affordable [Kindle version](https://smile.amazon.com/Consumer-Health-Guide-Intelligent-Decisions-ebook/dp/B07P7D6SQ5/ref=monarch_sidesheet) of the book was made available in 2019. Last year, the children's book, [There's No Such Thing as the Tooth Fairy!](https://smile.amazon.com/Theres-Such-Thing-Tooth-Fairy/dp/1667852442/ref=monarch_sidesheet) by Dr. Hall and Kevin Howell, was published. It was [based on a fable](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/announcing-a-new-childrens-book-that-promotes-critical-thinking/) about the Tooth Fairy at the end of one of Dr. Hall's most popular articles, [Teaching pigs to sing: An experiment in bringing critical thinking to the masses](https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2006/05/22164608/p36.pdf?_ga=2.164812223.1895642999.1659048583-1858339745.1649877068), published in the May/June 2006 issue of Skeptical Inquirer. Howell adapted the fable for the book and provided illustrations. Dr. Hall was much admired by participants in Quackwatch's [Health Fraud Discussion List](https://lists.quackwatch.org/mailman/listinfo/healthfraud_lists.quackwatch.org) where she contributed to more than 2,000 discussion threads. In 2005, a thread was started \"In Praise of Dr. Hall.\" Appreciation of her writings was a recurring theme on the list. Dr. Hall was a popular speaker at [The Amazing Meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Meeting) (James Randi Educational Foundation), the [Trottier Public Science Symposium at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/events-0/trottier-symposium), [Skeptic's Toolbox workshops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptic%27s_Toolbox), the World Skeptic Congress, [CSICON](https://web.archive.org/web/20171018012635/https://csiconference.org/) (Committee for Skeptical Inquiry), the [Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism](https://necss.org/about/), the [Australian Skeptics National Convention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajNqpUhauyk&ab_channel=VictorianSkeptics), LogiCal, and other conferences. The January 15 [Skeptic Zone (Australia) podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCfNUhfX-_c) paid tribute to Dr. Hall. The podcast includes an interview with her by host Richard Saunders from 2007. Dr. Hall provided [this rationale](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/for-discussion-should-i-only-write-about-fake-stuff-if-it-is-well-known/) for sometimes writing about pseudoscientific nonsense even when it isn't well-known: \"My SkepDoc's Rule is 'before you believe a claim, find out who disagrees with it and why.' And you can't do that if no one has bothered to disagree with it yet.\" Lies of the \"Liver King\" exposed. Leaked emails have revealed that self-proclaimed \"Liver King\" Brian Johnson's astoundingly muscular physique was due to anabolic steroids rather than eating raw animal organs as he had claimed on social media. According to an article written by exercise physiologist Nick Tiller, MRes, PhD., Johnson [confessed this to his followers, apologized, and attempted to justify his lies in a YouTube video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-08/tiktok-fitness-influencer-liver-king-exposed-using-steroids/101742792). [Tiller N. [The Liver King, lies, and logical fallacies](https://skepticalinquirer.org/exclusive/the-liver-king-lies-and-logical-fallacies/).
