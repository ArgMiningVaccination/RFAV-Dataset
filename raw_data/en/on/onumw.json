Request a Workshop R2 Performance Centers (see the Site Map on page 2) consist of a team of Performance Experts (PE) who can execute virtual training for individual mastery sessions or group workshops. The intended audience is Soldiers, Family Members, and DA Civilians. See below for a sampling of training and workshops offer ed: Healthy Habits During the ongoing COVID -19 epidemic, members of the Army Family are seeing changes in their day -to-day working and living situations. Social distancing, working from home, quarantine measures, and stay home orders are all prevalent acr oss the force. Many people are seeing their routines and habits interrupted; counselors recommend that people stick to a routine as Army Resilience Directorate ARD Ready and Resilient Resource and Activity Guide 10 30 April 2020 much as possible during the upheaval, so that people retain a sense of normalcy in their days. This workshop is intended to help individuals learn research -based strategies for implementing new habits. This training helps attendees adapt to their new working and living environments. This information will also be useful when people start to transition back to \"normal\" life and n eed to resume old routines and habits they perhaps have not been using for several weeks. Motivation and Goal Attainment People may be struggling to set realistic goals and find motivation to move forward in a time where we have had a complete disruption in our routines and a lot of potential stress and anxiety. Using simple techniques to help you follow through with small actions steps can contribute toward goal attainment, increased productivity, or increased feelings of control and satisfacti on. We can teach research -based strategies to increase focus, motivation, and goal attainment. For example, we can organize a training or series of trainings that help increase follow -through with at -home workout plans or increase movement toward goal atta inment. The content is framed in the context of fitness, nutrition, wellness, psychological well -being, and lifestyle modification & goals, and includes a personalized goal -setting practical exercise. Sleep and Well -Being Fort Rucker developed this workshop 4 years ago. It has been taught to Soldiers, DA Civilians, spouses and high school age kids. It's most effectively taught as a mix of education and discussion. Sleep is one of the least understood and least valued tools for our psychological and physical health. In a study conducted by WRAIR of 2,600 Soldiers at Fort Campbell, they showed that 61% slept less than 5 hours nightly. Even when WRAIR only looked at Soldiers who have never deployed, the proportion of Soldiers r eporting adequate sleep only rose from 14% to 16%. The short and long -term impact of this inadequate amount of sleep on the minds and bodies of our Soldiers is concerning. During this pandemic, it's an ideal time for people to work on developing better sle ep habits that hopefully carry over to when their lives return to a normal daily schedule. The tools provided in this PD can help mitigate the impact that the stress of COVID -19 is having by helping them to get high -quality sleep each night. The intent of this PD is to provide Soldiers, DA Civilians and family members with a better understanding of what sleep is and what the short and long -term outcomes on our brains and bodies are when we don't get adequate, quality sleep every night. This PD also educates people on some of the various factors that might be getting in the way of either falling asleep or getting good quality sleep. It also provides tips for how to get a good, quality night of sleep. Mindset Excellent performers tend to have a growth mindse t, a mindset that allows them to continually grow and develop skill over times. A fixed mindset reflects the belief that our ability on a specific task is set and stone and will likely not improve, regardless of the amount of effort you put into it. The be liefs you have about your ability on a variety of tasks can have a huge impact on your ability to perform at a high level. For example, if you believe you're not good at running - it will inevitably impact the way you approach training and improving your r un time. In the same vein, if you believe if school \"isn't your thing,\" it will impact the academic goals you pursue and your performance in classes. R2 Performance Centers can run virtual workshops that teach individuals the difference between the two min dsets and help us reflect on what mindset we hold on a variety of tasks. This workshop can be particularly helpful for those training for the ACFT that have concerns about their ability to perform or individuals struggling to adapt to new family or work en vironments.

Request a Workshop R2 Performance Centers (see the Site Map on page 2) consist of a team of Performance Experts (PE) who can execute vir tual training for individual mastery sessions or group workshops. The intended audience is Soldiers, Family Members, and DA Civilians. See below for a sampling of training and workshops offered: Managing Thoughts & Emotions In a stressful time period, it' s common for individuals to struggle to cope with counter -productive thoughts and uncomfortable emotions like fear or helplessness. R2 Performance Centers can run customized, virtual workshops that help individuals learn how their thoughts impact their actions and emotions. Further, we can focus on facilitating discussion around research -based patterns of thinking, and help individuals increase their awareness of their own patterns in thinking. Helping to identify patterns of thinking that undermine our res ilience is particularly Army Resilience Directorate ARD Ready and Resilient Resource and Activity Guide 19 30 April 2020 important. From there, we can teach strategies to help individuals learn to gain greater control over their emotions and reactions by shifting to more productive patterns in thinking. Values and Beliefs PEs can facilitate a workshop that helps individuals identify what expectations or values that they are placing on themselves or other people. For example, do you think you should be exercising more now that you're stuck at home? Or do you believe your spouse shou ld be taking on more responsibility around the house? Any time we use the word 'should,' it indicates an expectation we have or a value we hold on what our ideal world would look like. Becoming more aware of our 'shoulds' can help us have more control over our thoughts and emotions when someone (ourselves or others) doesn't live up to expectations. This workshop can help you have more control over your emotions and communicate more effectively with those you work with or have close relationships with. Stress Management Many of us experience stress on a daily basis. The stress responses (fight -or-flight) may be even more chronically activated during COVID -19 when our brains are constantly in a state of unknown and scanning for threats. There are several stra tegies that individuals can use to better cope with stress and regulate the way our bodies are spending precious energy. PEs can teach strategies that include deliberate breathing, re -interpreting the stress response, and leveraging our thoughts to help us regulate our energy levels more effectively.

See below for a sampling of training and workshops offered: Building Connection through Emotional Intelligence, Empathy and Vulnerability This workshop, focused on increasing our emotional intelligence and empathy, coul d be delivered virtually as a mastery session for a Family or a few families that are friends. Especially at a time when many of us are feeling all sorts of different emotions on a daily basis, this workshop can help children and adults process what they a re feeling and why.

Rapport Building Developed by the R2 Performance Center at Joint Base Lewis -McChord (JBLM), this h our-long training focus es on how to build rapport with others and both fellow Soldiers and Foreign Nationals. The training was originally designed as an in -person training but, due to COVID -19, it was adapted for online viewing to ensure all participants could observe social distancing orders. The training incorporated research on rapport building and two activities to give Soldier practice with the skills involved in building rapport - the skill of asking open -ended questions and the skill of vulnerability. Specifically, with regard to vulnerability, we discussed the sk ill of identifying the appropriate level of vulnerability and with whom to share this information. Both skills allow Soldiers to get to know each other on a deeper level, thereby establishing rapport and trust that is necessary to work together most effect ively. In addition, both skills were intentionally chosen given these Soldiers' need to eventually build rapport with Soldiers from other countries and cultures. Thus, both skills were directly applicable to the role of an advisor while deployed. Army Resilience Directorate ARD Ready and Resilient Resource and Activity Guide 24 30 April 2020 4. Spiritu al Spirituality is often defined as a sense of connection that gives meaning and purpose to a person's life. The spiritual dimension is specifically defined in the Army as the development of personal qualities needed to sustain a person in times of stress , hardship, and tragedy. These qualities come from religious, philosophical, or human values and form the basis for character, disposition, decision making , and integrity .\" Spirituality is unique to each individual and refers to the deepest part of you. Your spirit provides you with the revealing sense of who you are, why you are here and what your purpose for living is. The spiritual dimension is concept supported by medical evidence -based studies that applies to both religious and non -religious personnel. There are a multitude of spiritual resources available to help Army community personnel strengthen the spiritual dimension from diverse perspectives. Many of these spiritual resources include diverse pluralistic spiri tual disciplines, religious practices and programs, and moral - ethical decision -making resources that are discussed in this section below. The most important organization charged with supporting the spiritual dimension is the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps. US Army Chaplain Corps Services Chaplain Corps personnel have continued to serve diverse spiritual needs of religious and non - religious Army personnel since the Army's founding in 1775. The Corps is led by Chief of Chaplains' guidance prioritizing People and Community in supporting Army missions throughout the world. Chaplains, religious affairs specialists, and Chaplain Corps Civilians provide services to Army personnel and family members in every Army organization, delivering spiritual fitness and well -being supporting readiness and resilience. The Chaplain Corps has for decades enhanced global spiritual and religious support through virtual capacities such as video and social media platforms. The COVID -19 crisis has accelerated these virtual capabilities to help protect Soldiers and their families against the harmful potential effects of social isolation that may include suicide, substance abuse, sexual harassment/assault, and domestic violence. Services the Chaplain Corps continue s to perform or provide in clude, but are not limited to: Confidential Counseling - A capability chaplains offer that no other helping professional can similarly provide is no -exceptions confidentiality in one -on-one counseling on spiritual and religious issues. Any Soldier or Fami ly member wanting to speak to a chaplain confidentially as a spiritual advisor capacity about religious, spiritual, or even mere moral -ethical matters of \"conscience\", can talk freely to a chaplain without risk of disclosure. The privilege belongs to the i ndividual counselee, whether the person is religious or not. There are no exceptions to chaplain confidentiality when the privilege applies unless a counselee provides explicit consent. When a counselee needs counsel from a different spiritual background t han what a chaplain is able to personally perform, chaplains are trained to provide other counselors to provide the needed confidential counsel meeting the individual's unique spiritual needs. Crisis intervention (Suicide Prevention/Postvention and Critic al Incidents) - Many people who either a) are personally at risk to harm themselves or others, or b) know of someone at risk, are hesitant to initially come forward to seek professional help. Knowledge of the confidentiality and anonymity Chaplain Corps pe rsonnel offer is therefore highly useful to encourage people to seek chaplaincy help without risk of disclosure. Chaplains are trained to counsel, intervene, and refer at risk personnel to other helping professionals while always fully respecting and maint aining confidentiality requirements. Army Resilience Directorate ARD Ready and Resilient Resource and Activity Guide 25 30 April 2020 US Army Chaplain Corps Services Chaplains, Religious Affairs Specialists, and Chaplain Corps Civilians are conducting religious support capabilities in a virtual capacity to help protect Soldiers and their families aga inst the harmful effects of social isolation.

It is critical that we do not forget about the nation's addiction crisis, in our response to COVID -19, and instead build a comprehensive multi -agency approach that will prevent the spread of addiction and ensure access to treatment for all those in need. Signs and symptoms that indicate Alcohol Use Disorder may include: Unable to control the amount of alcohol you consume Wishing to cut down on alcohol but unable to do so Spending a significant amount of time in drinking, accessing alcohol or recovering from its use Feeling a strong urge to drink alcohol Failing in fulfilling obligations at your work, home or sc hool due to alcohol use Continuing to consume alcohol even when you know it is leading to social, physical or interpersonal problems Neglecting or reducing other activities and hobbies for drinking alcohol Developing alcohol tolerance such that you need to consume more alcohol in order to feel the desired effects Experiencing classic withdrawal symptoms such as sweating, nausea, alcohol cravings and shaking when you are not drinking or have quit drinking it There are numerous resources available for Soldi ers and their Family members who are ready to seek help for problematic alcohol use, these include: Behavioral Health Resources Available for Soldiers: Behavioral Health Officer Embedded Behavioral Health Team Primary Care Provider Unit Physician's Ass istant or Medics Military OneSource Family Members can also seek assistance through the Child and Family Behavioral Health Services within their assigned MTF. For Soldiers it is important to know that the Army has expanded treatment options to allow Soldiers meeting prescribed criteria to volunteer for and receive treatment for alcohol -related substance use disorders, aftercare, and proactively re -enter treatment without being mandated to participate in a treatment program. Implementation of this volunta ry care process has often allowed for early intervention prior to an alcohol related incident and has increased readiness to the Force. If you are not ready to seek medical help, try to cut down on the amount of alcohol you consume. Introduce other activities into your life that have a positive result such as yoga, meditation, or exercising.

Request a Workshop R2 Performance Centers (see the Site Map on page 2) consist of a team of Performance Experts (PE) who can execute virtual training for individual mastery sessions or group workshops. The intended audience is Soldiers, Family Members, and DA Civilians. See below for a sampling of training and workshops offered: Learning Each Other's Strengths and Building Cohesion Spouses and/or Parents and Children could benefit from this workshop geared at bring the Family closer together through Character Strengths. Because the intent is conversation and learning about each other, smaller groups or mastery sessions are recommended. Parents/Spouses take the full 240 question Values in Action (VIA) Character Strengths survey; Kids take they VIA Youth survey, which is a 24-question assessment. The worksho p would focus on facilitation conversation around what individuals learned about themselves, where they see strengths show up in the daily actions of themselves and their loved ones, and how to build winning streaks off an understanding of our strengths. T his would give the parents an opportunity to identify what traits their kids value, and what shows up most often in their behaviors, while also allowing spouses to identify what strengths show up most often between one another. Assertive Communication Families and close working relationships could benefit from workshops that discuss effective communication strategies. First, there are many difficult topics that may warrant discussion during an environment of constant change. For example, families may need to discuss financial challenges and subsequent budget changes, or close working relationships may need to re - examine priorities and the way we tend to communicate throughout the workday. As a result, PEs can facilitate a workshop that targets effective as sertive communication strategies that will increase effective problem solving while maintaining or building the quality of the relationship. Will you be there for me when things go right? Research shows that for the relationships that are most important to us (spouse, kids, Family , close friends) the way we respond to someone's good news is just as important as how we respond to someone's bad news. For the relationships that are most import ant to us, it is critical that we learn how we tend to respond when those we care about share a positive experience Army Resilience Directorate ARD Ready and Resilient Resource and Activity Guide 38 30 April 2020 with us. For example, do you just smile and nod because you're busy answering e -mails? Do you tend to poke holes in the good news because yo u have concerns about it? The way we respond in these moments can either build or break our closest relationships. Research shows that if we can get it right, we will experience increases in trust, intimacy, and fun while experiencing decreases in conflict and daily hassles. PEs can facilitate a workshop around what the four different styles of responding look like, what your own personal style of responding is, and how to shift to the one style that actually builds our relationships.

Do you have trouble staying asleep, falling asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like? Do you rely on coffee and energy drinks to get you through the day? This may mean that you're not building effective sleep habits and/or could benefit from tracking issues with sleep to talk to a doctor. If you want to get ahead of the curve, start keeping a sleep diary to help you track your sleep behaviors and habits. A sleep diary is a record of your sleep patterns and habits that include things such as: What time you went to bed How long it took to fall asleep The time you get up in the morning How many times you woke up during the night How refreshing the sleep was What may have been interfering with your sleep (e.g. temperature, breathing issues) Number of caffeinated beverages throughout the day Number of alcoholic beverages throughout the day Medications taken throughout the day Time spent exercising Activities leading up to sleep (e.g. 1 hour before bedtime) You can use a diary to give you a better idea of your sleep patterns and habits, be more proactive about sleep solutions, give a doctor critical information about your sleep patterns, and possible monitor if changes you are making are effective in improving your sleep habits. SLEEP DIARY 42When I notice that my thoughts are taking me away from the present moment, then I can use this journal page to capture my thoughts on paper .

( specific, measurable, action -focused, realistic, and time -bound) plan to bring more of them to your daily leadership: 47The Communication Spectrum: \u00dfPassive ----------------------- Assertive ----------------------------- Aggressive \u00e0 Communication is a skill, not a personality trait. We all can communicate with others anywhere along this spectrum, although we may already have a style that we're most comfortable with. Aggressive communication can be helpful when there is an urgency and importance to the message that is being sent. Passive communication cab be helpful when you are receiving information, or trying to avoid rocking the boat. Assertive communication can be helpful when (1) you're trying to address a problem or concern, and (2) you want to maintain or build the relationship with the individual you're speaking to Tips for Assertive Communication: \u00a7Do your homework \u00a7Take responsibility - spend time thinking about how you may have contributed to the problem or issue, and be able to own up to it during the conversation. \u00a7Understand any core values that may be driving your anger, frustration, disappointment, etc \u00a7Be specific when describing the problem and minimize exaggeration \u00a7Be a good listener, try and repeat back what you're hearing (listen, don't just wait for your opportunity to speak) \u00a7Use \"I statements\" - frame things from your perspective \u00a7\"you\" statements that can lead to defensiveness from the other person. \u00a7Ask questions - try and pre-plan questions to ask that allow you to get the other person's perspective, have a better understanding of the situation, and work towards a win-winAssertive Communication 48Describe the scenario: I Identify and understand the problem: (What values and/or beliefs are in play? Think about the scenario from multiple perspectives to make sure you're being accurate and thorough with your thinking) D Describe the problem objectively and accurately: (The who, what , when, and where; just the facts of the situation to orient the other person to the conversation and help them jog their memory of the issue in question) E Express your concerns and how you feel (when appropriate): (Try to use accurate language to describe the specific concerns you have and the specific emotions you're experiencing if it is appropriate in the workplace environment) A Ask the other person for his/her perspective: (You may learn some new information & it shows that you value the relationship) Ask for a reasonable change: (There may be some compromise here, but the change you settle on should be realistic) L List the positive outcomes that will occur if the person makes the agreed upon change: ASSERTIVE COMMUNICATION THE IDEAL MODEL 49What are the characteristics of INEFFECTIVE communication? What are the characteristics of EFFECTIVE communication? What are some of the obstacles that prevent you from communicating effectively all of the time? COMMUNICATION 50What strategies can you use to overcome these obstacles ? How are you going to hold yourself accountable to use these strategies? How are you going to hold others accountable to use thse strategies? COMMUNICATION 51LIMIT YOUR LONELINESS GAMES AND ACTIVITIES TO HELP YOU CONNECT WITH OTHERS 52 LIMIT YOUR LONELINESS: IMPROV GAMES Find a buddy and play. 1.Questions: Speak only in the form of a question. Try to have a conversation using only questions. Whoever messes up first loses. 2.Random Phrase: During a meal while sitting with others, have everyone write down a random phrase (ex: \"I wish pencils came in other colors ...yellow makes me nervous\") and put it in their pocket. The goal is to try to embed the phrase into normal conversation. If no one calls you on using \"your phrase\" you win. Everyone else at the table should also be trying to embed their phrase and not getting caught. At the end of the meal everyone should show their pieces of paper with the phrase to prove they said it. 3.Tell a Story: You need at least 3 people to play. Together you all are going to tell a cohesive story. Sitting in a circle or taking turns on a video call each person adds to the story ONE word at a time. By listening carefully and being playful you start to build sentences and eventually a story. The game ends when your story comes to a conclusion. (For your later enjoyment have someone write the story down as it builds.) 4.Snapshots: This game can be done over video calls or in person. Have one person be the designated moderator. Before starting everyone should compile a list of movies and/or tv shows that most of the group has seen. If you are co-located with multiple people, split into teams of 3-4. If you are doing this via video chat , each \"household\" can participate as a team. Once the list is compiled the moderator will pick a movie/show at random. Using only your bodies each team has 1 min to create a \"snapshot\" of a scene from the movie/show. The moderator gets to decide who created the best scene. That team gets a point. Feel free to rotate the moderator. 5.Dub a foreign film: (Ideal for 4 people, can be done via video chat if there are at least 2 people at one location) Two participants will play the role of foreigners in a film. In a scene where they pretend to have a conversation with one another, these players will speak gibberish and act with exaggerated expressions and hand movements. The other 2 players will dub the scene with lines that they feel would most appropriately fit the first two player's acting. You could also just do this with real foreign films. Turn off the captions and have a blast! Assign each specific character to a family member and have them provide all official dialogue for that character. 53LIMIT YOUR LONELINESS: TEAM BUILDING GAMES These games can be played with minimal equipment. (refer to Connect with Kids section for additional games to play with kids) 1.Two degrees of separation: The goal of this conversation is to find out what you have in common with someone 2 layers deep. For example- \"we both live in Florida andturns out our cousins go to the same HS.\" If you are playing with family try not to use anything obvious like \"we both have the last name____ and we live at Fort Bragg.\" The goal is to really talk with people and discover more about them beyond theobvious. 2.The floor is lava! (just like when you were a kid): Pick out two locations in your home/living quarters; one place is the start, one is the finish. Collect random itemsand objects from around your home/living quarters (these should be durable thingsthat can be stepped on, dropped, used to hold on to, etc.). You need 1 less object than number of players (i.e., if 4 people are playing you need 3 objects). Objects may be placed in the LAVA as \"safe zones\" but can be used in any way to help you move. The goal of the game is to make it from the start point to the finish without any part of any player's body coming into contact with the floor/ground aka LAVA (parents: feelfree to decide how furniture is used in the game). 3.Gratitude Jar: Start a gratitude jar! Cut up small pieces of colorful paper and keep them nearby your jar with pens or markers. Throughout the day take a moment to stop and jot down something you're thankful for. At the end of the day or week read them out loud with your family/friends. You could also post a whiteboard or keep ajournal full of the things you're grateful for, small and large. Or try scheduling a certain time each day where everyone shares something good. Get the family, kids, or roommates involved. Challenge everyone to write at least one thing per day that involves another person. Make sure you ask some reflection questions about each other's good news. For example: 1.What does this Good Stuff mean to you? 2.How can you get more of this Good Stuff? 3.Why is this Good Stuff for you? (not in a judgmental tone!) 541.Pictionary/Charades Tournament: Divide into two teams. Each team writes down as many words or phrases (list of examples below) as they can think of for the other team to draw (Pictionary) or act out (Charades). Each word or phrase should be put on an individual piece of paper and then put into a hat, bowl, or pile. Pick a team to go first. One person on the team will draw a word from the pile made by the opposing team. They will then have 2 minutes (or any agreed upon time limit) to draw or act out the word or phrase until their team guesses correctly. If the team guesses correctlywithin the time limit, that team may keep going. If they are unable to correctly guess, their turn is over, and it is the other team's turn. A different player must draw each round. Go back and forth until there are no more words/phrases. Each word or phrase is worth one point; teams only get a point by correctly guessing the word/phrase; the team with the most points win. 2.Pictionary with a twist: As a group DRAW a bunch of items, simple actions, places and put them into a hat (similar to above). One person will be thecommunicator everyone else will attempt to draw what you are describing. The communicator will pick a picture out of a hat and then start describing HOW (\"make a line here\") to draw it to everyone. DO NOT tell them what the picture is (it's a Bunny). Once the communicator is done everyone will show and compare their drawings and try to guess the name of the object/place/action. Whomever originally drew the picture can finally tell everyone what they were drawing. LIMIT YOUR LONELINESS: TEAM BUILDING GAMES ( CONT.)

Then, have them eliminate 6, so they're left with 6. Discuss. Have them eliminate 2 more values (left with 4). Discuss. Eliminate 1 (left with 3) and discuss. Eliminate 1 (left with 2) then discuss. Then eliminate one more so they are left with only one value. Discuss. Debrief: Mini debriefs will occur after each round of elimination. Ask participants examples of values they chose to eliminate and why they chose those. The difficulty comes when the number of values gets smaller (like the last 2 -3 rounds). Ask participants why it became more difficult. How did they chose which values to eliminate, because at that point the values are probably more of those core values and beliefs. This activity gives participants an opportunity to learn more about the people that they work with and are around on a daily basis, maybe on more of a personal level than they are used to. It can give them an idea of what really drives those they work with. It can also give each individual an opportunity to evaluate his or her own core values, and provides a time for self -reflection and prioritizing.Value Subtraction 58Personal Philosophy Philosophy: A theory or attitude held by a person or organization that acts as a guiding principle for behavior A philosophy is: Personal: There's no right or wrong Your choice: If you are intentional and use reflection, you can deliberately choose your philosophy Meant to be a foundation: Using your core values and beliefs in your philosophy means you will have motivation and clarity to guide your decisions Steps to creating a philosophy: 1. List your core values (what or who you aspire to be). Below are some common values, select approximately five that have the greatest impact on how you live your life and the choices you make on a daily basis : __ Accountability __ Achievement __ Ambition __ __ beliefs Other: 2. Decide what area of your life you want to create a philosophy for (leadership, excellence, parenting, etc.) 3. State your beli efs (what you believe to be true/perceived reality) about the selected area of your life Example : I believe excellence is something that doesn't come easy; it requires hard work and perseverance. 4. Write what you expect from yourself in this selected area of life - incorporate your values 5. Write what others can expect from you in your selected area of life - incorporate your values 59C-1. The following ethical reasoning framework (Figure C-1) is designed to help leaders reason through complex ethical problems or decisions consistent with Army design methodology. Design methodology entails understanding operational environments, framing problems, and developing approaches to solving problems (ADP 5-0 ). For ongoing unit morale or ethical-moral problems, command climate and unit culture and subcultures are the \"operational environment\" in which problems and approaches are framed. Internal advisement issues may also arise from conflicts between a unit's own perspectives and those cultural or moral perspectives existing outside the unit in the larger operational environment. This framework incorporates five major philosophical approaches, or lenses, through which to consider ethical thought. Figure C-1. A n ethical reasoning framework within Army design methodology C-2. This framework is adapted from Ethical Reasoning at the Strategic Level: An Applied Ethical Framework for the Profession of Arms , School of Strategic Landpower Faculty Paper (Jonathan Shaw, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania: U.S. Army War College, September 11, 2014). Extracted from Appendix C, ATP 1-05.04, Religious Support and Internal Advisement, MARCH 2017 Ethical Reasoning within Army Design Methodology 60The Joint Ethics Regulation Ethical Decision Making Framework The Joint Ethics Regulation , DoD 5500.07-R, Section 65 recommends Department of Defense employees consider incorporating the following plan to ensure careful review of ethical consequences when alternative solutions seem proper under existing laws and regulations. D-1. Define the Problem. Proceed from a general statement of the problem to specific statements of the decisions to be made. As you take the following steps, such as identifying goals and naming stakeholders, new problems or needed decisions may become apparent. Be willing to add these to your problem list as you go. D-2. Identify the Goal(s). Proceed from a general statement of an end result both long term and short term. Be prepared to add to this list as you take the following steps. Goals are something to strive toward. They are statements of the best possible results. The very best is not always achieved for everyone. Many problems do not allow f or \"win/win\" outcomes. Be prepared to fall somewhat short of some goals for the sake of ethics and other considerations. D-3. List Applicable Laws or Regulations. Laws and regulations are basic constraints within which official decisions are made. Until all relevant laws and regulations are considered, ethical decision-making is impossible. Although it is conceivable that an ethical decision could violate a law or regulation, such circumstance s are rare. D-4. List the Ethical Values at Stake. Listing the ethical values at stake can awaken you to problems and goals that you may not have o therwise considered. It may alert you to stakeholders you may not ha ve recognized. Listing the values reminds yo u of your commitment to them at a time when the stress of the problem may cause you to forget. D-5. Name All the Stakeholders. A stakeh older is anyone who is likely to be affected by a decision. Many stakeholder s will be apparent because of the previous steps you already followed. More will occur to you as you give the matter a few m inutes of thought. Do no t forget to include you rself and the people w ho may depend on you for support, both at work and at home. As you list the stakeholders, try to note the way your decision could affect them. In other words, name what is at stake for the stakeholder. D-6. Gather Additional Information. This step is frequently overlooked. The stress from the problem urges speedy solutions. However, hasty decisions usually create problems of their own. Take the time to gather all nec essary information. Ask questions, demand proof when appropriate, check your assumptions. D-7. State All Feasible Solutions. By this time, some feasible solutions will h ave presented themselves. Others may be found by sharing the lists and information you have pulled together and \"brain storming.\" As you state the feasible solutions, note which stakeholders could be affected and what might be gained or lost. D-8. Eliminate Unethical Options. There ma y be solutions that seem to resolve the problem and reach the goal but which are clearly unethical. Rem ember that short ter m solu tions are not worth s acrificing our commi tme nt to ethics. The lon g term pr oblems of unethical solutions will not be worth the short term advantages. E liminate the unethical solutions. D-9. Rank Remaining Solutions. Other solutions may not be clearly unethical but may be questionable. You may have to rely on intuition or \"gut feelings\" to weed out these solutions. Put these possible solutions at the bottom of your list. Rank the remaining solutions, which are all ethical ones, in order of how close they bring you to your goal and solve the problem. D-10. Commit To and Implement the Best Ethical Solution. Commitment and implementation are vital to the ethical decision-making process. Determining which solution is the best ethical one is a meaningless exercise unless implementation of the ethical solution follows. If the right decision is not implemented, the door is left wide open for others to implement unethical solutions.Extracted from Appendix D, ATP 1-05.04, Religious Support and Internal Advisement, MARCH 2017 61Confident Clear Controlled Elements to agree upon when writing your Conflict Contract: Decide how to initiate conversation: (topic to be discussed, problem you'd like to resolve ) Choose the best time and place: (remove distractions, allow enough time for both parties to discuss ) Determine the indicators that tell us we need to take a break from the discussion and come back at a later time: (emotion, mood, rabbit holes) Share with each other do's and don'ts: (tone, language, behaviors, bringing up old/unrelated issues ) Sign & Date ______________________________________________________________ Tips for an effective conversation: Avoid exaggeration Use \"I\" language vs. blaming language Take deep breaths Listen to understand your partner Don't interrupt Work toward a win -win Label your emotions Ask for do-overConflict Contract 62Family Readiness Plan R2 Dimension: Family Preparedness Text: For individuals at home on lock down, it's important to create a routine and daily schedule that is realistic, not idealistic. Routines help create structure and expectation which can reduce stress and increase productivity, but in order for a routine to have these impacts, it has to be something the entir e family can agree to and follow . Be sure to incorporate the 5 dimensions of personal readiness into your routine. The 5 dimensions of personal readiness are Physical, Psychological, Social, Family Preparedness and Spiritual. R2 Dimension: Ph ysical Text: Avoiding the gym is ideal for reducing the spread of COVID -19, but avoiding physical activity is not ideal for readiness. Tips for staying active at home: 1.Set workout goals - Having personally meaningful goals helps to increase internal motiv ation, which can give you that extra push to stick to your workout plan. 2. Preplan your workout before beginning -Many YouTube channels that offer workouts of varying difficulty levels. Better yet, Ready First Soldiers can contact their Battalion H2F team to receive tailored at home workouts. 3.Find someone who will keep you accountable -Having another person to check -in with about your workouts can help increase the likelihood of following through with your fitness plan. R2 Dimension: Psychological Text: The uncertainty of local and world impacts of COVID- 19 can cause some people to have elevated anxiety. Reduce uncertainty by identifying what you can control, and what is outside your control. 63Family Readiness Plan R2 Dimension: Spiritual Text: In a time of uncertainty, it can be challenging to maintain a sense of meaning, fulfillment, hope and purpose. Here are some ways to practice spirituality during your day. R2 Dimension: Family Pr eparedness Text: With so much extra family time, planning ways to incorporate each member o f the family into the routine can mean the difference between connection and disconnection. 1.Set house rules and boundaries that respect each family members needs, while family time is important, it's imp ortant to also take a break and have some time to you rself. 2.Set realistic limit s on screen time, kids are more likely to act out and get irritable as screen time increases. Look for a balance of electronic programs that involve interaction and education. 3. Pre -plan specific times and activities that the entire family can be involved in such as a card game, baking cookies, scavenger hunts, or a walk around the neighborhood. R2 Dimension: Psychological Text: Grateful people are happier and more fulfilled. Gratitude leads you to be nicer to other people: more cooperative , patient and trusting. Cultivating an attitude of gratitude is easy t o do with a simple activity that only takes about 10 minutes a day. How do you d o it? Each day record three good things that happened in the last 24 hours , and why you are grateful. How does it work? This b rief activity helps you to reflect on the many things that happen each day that you can be grateful for. Over time, you begin to look for good things during the day to add to your list. You can complete this a ctivity on your own, or get the whole family inv olved. #HTGS 1.Self-R eflection- Set aside some time each day to reflect on yourself, those you love and the things you a re grateful for. 2.Try Yoga or Meditation- The re are many mental and physical benefits t o practici ng yoga and meditation. Online resources to get you started include YouTube pages, mindfulness apps, and \"How to\" Pinterest pages. 3.Attend online spiritual/religious services 64Family Readiness Plan 65Naturally, with your child's performances, there are opportunities for criticism and praise. Thinking more about the activities your child participates in, have you ever considered that your language around praise and criticism may have an influence on their performance? Even if you perceive you are providing criticism and praise in a productive way, if critical information is left out of the conversation, it's possible your child may not be receiving the feedback the way you intended it. CRITICISM Have you ever given the criticism, \"that was not your best\" or \"better luck next time\" or \"you'll never be good enough\" or \"your classmates are working harder than you\"? What makes these examples of criticism NOT effective? 1.What exactly is the criticism referring to? 2.Is the criticism about their attitude or effort? 3.What part of the performance? A failed attempt? A mistake? If your child is receiving ineffective criticism, they might not be able to distinguish what exactly was wrong about the performance and are unable to make the necessary corrections, making it difficult to learn from their mistakes. How exactly can you make criticism effective ? There are two parts to effective criticism. The important thing to remember is PBS: P rocess , behavior , and strategy . When giving effective criticism to someone, name the process, the behavior, or the strategy so they know specifically what the criticism is about. Next, offer the person information on HOW to improve. This part of effective criticism helps your child learn from their actions or behaviors! By being specific about what exactly you are criticizing (PBS, NOT the person) and providing ideas for how to correct it, your child is more likely to understand what exactly the criticism is about and learn how to implement corrections for future performances. This makes it easier for your child to learn from their mistakes and not give up in the face of setbacks.Can Your Language Influence Your Child's Performances? Ineffective Criticism Process, Behavior, Strategy HOW to improve \"What are you even doing?\"\"I noticed you're dribbling the basketball with your eyes down......try looking ahead and focusing on a target for 3 seconds before you look down again.\" \"You always forget things. \" \"I see you left your homework on the table again......how about after every time you finish your homework, put your folder in your backpack?\" 66PRAISE Have you ever given the praise, \"good job\" or \"you did so well\" or \"you're a rockstar\" or \"you're so good at math\"? What makes these examples of praise NOT effective? These phrases of praise are missing critical information: 1.What exactly is the praise referring to? 2.Is the praise for their attitude or effort? 3.What part of the performance? A successful execution of a skill? Generic praise can be nice to hear, but it doesn't help your child understand what exactly they did well nor provide them the information they need to make sure they do it again. It is only the first step in effective praise, but all you need to add is one more sentence. Effective praise offers your child information regarding the specific strategy , effort , or skill that led to the successful outcome you are praising. This process is similar to PBS, which you are utilizing for effective criticism. Think about it like this: If you just ate the best chocolate cake you've ever had in your whole life, you would probably want to know what ingredients were used to make this chocolate cake so delicious. The same idea applies to providing your child effective praise for their performance. You can help your child identify the ingredients to their own success. Therefore, your child is able to create winning streaks , meaning that effective praise lets the person knows EXACTLY what they did well so they are able to replicate the strategy , effort , or skill in the future. Utilizing effective praise not only benefits your child by creating future winning streaks , but also builds connection. By providing your child information regarding the specific strategy , effort , or skill , you are demonstrating that you were paying attention to their performance. This also demonstrates authenticity because the effective praise was created by YOU specifically for THEM. DISCLAIMER Only praise when praiseworthy! Meaning, if parts of your child's performance do not require praise, it is not necessary to praise. When you do decide to praise, it's important to make sure effective praise is about the PROCESS (strategy, effort, skills) and NOT the PERSON (talent/ability). Your child will be able to focus on putting effort into mastery, instead of relying on their talent for success.Can Your Language Influence Your Child's Performances? Initial Praise Strategy, Effort, or Skill \"You did awesome today.\" \"When they player on the opposing team tripped over first base, you were a good sport and helped them up.\" \"Good job during your debate.\"\"You looked extremely confident today because your tone was strong and clear, and you made eye contact with the audience and the opposing team.\" 67PRACTICE The examples below simulate experiences a parent might face with their child that encompass praise and criticism. After reading each example, 1. Write a response of what you might say to your child in reaction to this situation, 2. Identify which type of feedback you used (praise or criticism), then 3. Decide whether your or not your response is effective. If yes, identify how it is effective in the space below. If no , re-write the response to meet the effective criteria and underline what makes it effective. Your child hands you their exam from math. The score is a 97%. Response:What type of feedback was this? _________________ Effective: _____ Yes _____ No You are in the car on the ride home with your child from their sporting event. They made several mistakes during the event and lost. Response:What type of feedback was this? _________________ Effective: _____ Yes _____ No Your child is in the school play and forgets most of their lines when they are on stage. Response:What type of feedback was this? _________________ Effective: _____ Yes _____ No You notice your child finished doing the chores, and they are below standard. Response:What type of feedback was this? _________________ Effective: _____ Yes _____ No Your child brings home a paper they wrote and the grade is an F. Response:What type of feedback was this? _________________ Effective: _____ Yes _____ No Can Your Language Influence Your Child's Performances? 68 Overview The purpose of this activity is to teach kids that while we can't always control what happens to us, we can control how we think about it. Kids will learn about optimism, and how they have power over their thinking. What is Optimism?/ Benefits of Optimism Optimism is seeing the good while being realistic. Thinking optimistically helps us be healthier, happier, and even do better in school. Controlling our thoughts/ Rainy and Sunny Thoughts One way to build optimism is to notice when something happens and we have a \"rainy\" thought (that makes us feel sad, mad, frustrated, lonely) and try to change it to a \"sunny\" thought (that makes us feel strong, happy, confident) ASK: How do rainy thoughts make us feel? How do sunny thoughts make us feel? Do you have an example of what a rainy thought or a sunny thought looks like? Rainy thoughts don't always make us feel good or help us do the best we can. It is OK to have rainy thoughts and to feel sad or mad, we just need to learn when they get in our way and how to deal with them. We have power over our thoughts and we can change them so that we can feel better, stronger, and be the best we can be. Sunny Thought/Rainy Thought Game I'll give you an event and two thoughts that you could have. Help me identify the rainy thought and the sunny thought that we could change it to. (Feel free to adjust these to events your family is actually going through). I have to go to school online: Rainy : \"Online school is hard, I'd rather do regular school.\" Sunny: \"I'm trying a new way to learn, and I get to sit on my comfy couch!\" I am unable to see my friends: Rainy : \"It's boring not being able to play with my friends.\" Sunny: \"I am going to find something fun to do today, and make a list of things I want to do with my friends when I can see them again.\" My sibling and I have been around each other a lot and got into a fight: Rainy : \"They're the worst!\" Sunny: \"Maybe they're just having a bad day.\" I have to stay home: Rainy : \"I'm bored at home and this is never going to get better!\" Sunny: \"Having to stay home is only going to last for a little while. I'm happy that I get to be with my family all day.\" Teaching Kids about their Thoughts 69Practice with your own thoughts: Try giving kids an event and have them create their own sunny and rainy thoughts. How did you feel after using the sunny thought instead of the rainy thought? Choosing a sunny thought usually makes us feels better and helps us do better. PRO-TIP: Print out a copy of the sunny and rainy thought cards attached, cut them out, and glue them back-to-back so one side has the rain cloud and the other has the sunshine. They can use these to remind themselves that they have a choice in how they think and feel, and that makes them more resilient.
