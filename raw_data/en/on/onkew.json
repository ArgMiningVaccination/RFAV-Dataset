Flu season is rapidly approaching and, with it, constant reminders to get vaccinated. This despite the fact that mounting research suggests this approach to flu prevention may be incorrect for long-term health, and doesn't actually work in the first place. In January 2015, U.S. government officials admitted that, in most years, flu shots are, at best, 50 to 60 percent effective at preventing lab confirmed influenza requiring medical care. Then, in December 2015, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis of flu vaccine effectiveness revealed that, between 2005 and 2015, the influenza vaccine was less than 50 percent effective more than half of the time. This is not including the risks associated with all the chemical adjuvants in the vaccine. Some components of the vaccine such as Thimerosal [Mercury based] and Aluminium are known neurotoxins and can adversely effect our brain , immune functions and can cause Gillian-Barre Syndrome- a real and dangerous disease! Here are some easy and healthier choices to optimize our immune functions! Power up with Probiotics. We have more bacteria in our bodies than cells. We have around 70 trillion cells in the human body. Stress, alcohol,antibiotics and poor health habits can reduce the number go good bacteria that make up our microbiome. The brain-gut connection is real and powerfully effects our innate immune system. We are supposed to get these good bacteria from local fruits and vegetables. Because of our northern climate,we need to either make fermented vegetables or take a good non-dairy supplement [sorry yogurt is ineffective] to replenish all the good bacteria and build up our immune defences.Vit D Levels are Critical This is one of the single best strategies for avoiding infections of all kinds, and research suggests vitamin D deficiency may actually be the true culprit behind the seasonality of the flu \u2014 not the flu virus itself. Raising your vitamin D to a therapeutic level of 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) is probably the single most important and least expensive action you can take to avoid the flu. I recommend taking 1000 I.U/40Ibs of weight. |Avoid sugar and processed foods. Sugars feed bad bacteria and impairs the function of your immune system almost immediately. A healthy immune system is one of the most important keys to fighting off viruses ,cancer and other pathogenic invaders. Remember grains like wheat,spelt,rice,oats break down into sugar and have the same ill-effect.| |Rest up. Just like it becomes harder for you to get your daily tasks done if you're tired, if your body is overly fatigued, it will be harder for it to fight the flu. Get to bed before 10pm so you can get into deep REM and avoid technology 2hrs before bed.| |Adapt to your stress. When stress becomes overwhelming, your body goes into flight or fight mode and will be less able to fight off the flu and other illness. If you feel stress is taking a toll on your health, take action to help yourself like walking in nature,deep abdominal breathing,learn meditation, spend time with people who care and have common values,read a book, and only focus on things that YOU CAN CONTROL!| |Movement. When you exercise, you increase your circulation and your blood flow throughout your body. The components of your immune system are also better circulated, which means your immune system has a better chance of finding an illness before it spreads. Exercise is also a great stress buster.| |Animal-based omega-3. Increase your intake of healthy and essential fats like the Bonfire fish oils. This is crucial for maintaining health. Also avoid damaged omega-6 oils and trans fats found in processed foods as they will damage your immune response.A | |Wash your hands. Washing your hands will decrease your likelihood of spreading a virus to your nose, mouth or other people. Antibacterial soaps are completely unnecessary, however, and cause far more harm than good. Instead, just use a mild, toxin-free soap and warm water.| |Use natural immune boosters. Examples include oil of oregano and garlic,ginger . These have potent antibiotic activity, boosting your body's ability to fend off harmful bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Unlike pharmaceutical antibiotics, they do not appear to lead to resistance.| | Wellness Chiropractic care.
