Homeopathic remedies can be taken over long periods of time and also to alleviate acute symptoms either one at a time or in combination. The system is based on the idea that substances that produce symptoms of sickness in healthy people will have a curative effect when given in very dilute quantities to sick people who exhibit those same symptoms. The remedies stimulate the body to heal itself. Homeopathy is a safe treatment, as it uses medicines from plant, animal or mineral sources in extremely diluted quantities, and there are usually minimal side effects. Its non-toxicity makes it a good choice for the treatment of children. "}
