Humans had to struggle for continuity and progress. Due to the physical and emotional imbalance caused during this process, the efficiency of vital bodily functions including immunity were disturbed. This made humans prone to frequent infections and illnesses. Unhealthy food, less physical activity, inadequate sleep, emotional imbalance and disturbed toxin elimination functions in the body can be considered the key contributors to a weak immune system. After a proper cleansing process and appropriate lifestyle change, the immune system does not have to fight against accumulated toxins or support the recovery process from unhealthy habits. This rests the immune system and gives it time to rejuvenate and get to optimum condition and fight against external threats.
