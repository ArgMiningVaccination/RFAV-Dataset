That experience motivated me to want to care for people, and lead me to the field of neuroimmunology. I have since discovered a drug for multiple sclerosis, which is FDA approved. I would like to solve other diseases and make them past history, like polio, something we no longer fear. We have three other new drugs in clinical trials for diseases ranging from type 1 diabetes to progressive multiple sclerosis.

Microglia directly interact with motor neurons and participate in the progression of ALS. Single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis revealed prominent expression of 5 in microglia and macrophages in a superoxide dismutase-1 G93A mouse model of ALS (SOD1G93A). In postmortem tissues from ALS patients with various clinical ALS phenotypes and disease duration, 5 integrin is prominent in motor pathways of the central and peripheral nervous system and in perivascular zones associated with the blood-brain barrier. In SOD1G93A mice, administration of a monoclonal antibody against 5 integrin increased survival compared to an isotype control and improved motor function on behavioral testing. Together, these findings in mice and in humans suggest that 5 integrin is a potential therapeutic target in ALS.

When modeling NMO, only but caused CNS autoimmunity in recipient WT mice, indicating that a tightly regulated mechanism normally ensures tolerance to AQP4. Here, we found that pathogenic AQP4 T cell epitopes bind MHC II with exceptionally high affinity. Examination of T cell receptor (TCR) / usage revealed that AQP4-specific T cells from AQP4-/- mice employed a distinct TCR repertoire and exhibited clonal expansion. Selective thymic AQP4 deficiency did not fully restore AQP4-reactive T cells, demonstrating that thymic negative selection alone did not account for AQP4-specific tolerance in WT mice. Indeed, AQP4-specific Th17 cells caused paralysis in recipient WT or B cell-deficient mice, which was followed by complete recovery that was associated with apoptosis of donor T cells. However, donor AQP4-reactive T cells survived and caused persistent paralysis in recipient mice deficient in both T and B cells or mice lacking T cells only. Thus, AQP4 CNS autoimmunity was limited by T cell-dependent deletion T cells. In contrast, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific T cells survived and caused sustained disease in WT mice. These findings underscore the importance of peripheral T cell deletional tolerance to AQP4, which may be relevant to understanding the balance of AQP4-reactive T cells in health and in NMO. T cell tolerance to AQP4, expressed in multiple tissues, is distinct from tolerance to MOG, an autoantigen restricted in its expression.

Rivers and colleagues were trying to understand what caused neurological reactions to viral infections like smallpox, vaccinia, and measles, and what triggered rare instances of encephalomyelitis to smallpox vaccines. The animal model known as EAE continues to display its remarkable utility. Recent research, since the 70th-anniversary tribute, helps explain how Epstein-Barr virus triggers multiple sclerosis via molecular mimicry to a protein known as GlialCAM. Proteins with multiple domains similar to GlialCAM, tenascin, neuregulin, contactin, and protease kinase C inhibitors are present in the poxvirus family. These observations take us a full circle back to Rivers' first paper on EAE, 90 yr ago.

We focus on two areas: The first area concerns the molecular mechanisms underlying how clonal antibody in the CSF emanates in widespread molecular mimicry to key antigens in the nervous system including GlialCAM, a protein associated with chloride channels. A second and equally high priority in the roadmap concerns various therapeutic approaches that are related to blocking the mechanisms whereby EBV triggers MS. Therapies deserving of attention include clinical trials with antivirals and the development of 'inverse' vaccines based on nucleic acid technologies to control or to eradicate the consequences of EBV infection. High enthusiasm is given to continuation of ongoing clinical trials of cellular adoptive therapy to attack EBV-infected cells. Clinical trials of vaccines to EBV are another area deserving attention. These suggested topics involving research on mechanism, and the design, implementation and performance of well-designed trials are not intended to be an exhaustive list. We have splendid tools available to our community of medical scientists to tackle how EBV triggers MS and then to perhaps change the world with new therapies to potentially eradicate MS, as we have done with nearly complete success for poliomyelitis.

Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the CNS, and their dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Recent advances highlight the pivotal role of cellular metabolism in programming immune responses. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanisms that drive astrocyte pathogenicity remain elusive. Nicotinamide adenine (NAD+) is a vital coenzyme involved in cellular redox reactions and a substrate for NAD+-dependent enzymes. Cellular NAD+ levels are dynamically controlled by synthesis and degradation, and dysregulation of this balance has been associated with inflammation and disease. Here, we demonstrate that cell-autonomous generation of NAD+ via the salvage pathway regulates astrocyte immune function. Inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a key enzyme in the salvage pathway, results in depletion of NAD+, inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, and limits astrocyte inflammatory potential. We identified CD38 as the main NADase up-regulated in reactive mouse and human astrocytes in models of neuroinflammation and MS. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of astrocyte CD38 augmented NAD+ levels, chemotactic potential to inflammatory monocytes, and ameliorated EAE. We found that CD38 activity is mediated via calcineurin/NFAT signaling in mouse and human reactive astrocytes. Thus, NAMPT-NAD+-CD38 circuitry in astrocytes controls their ability to meet their energy demands and drives the expression of proinflammatory transcriptional modules, contributing to CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, MS. Our results identify candidate therapeutic targets in MS.

Ublituximab is being evaluated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis.In two identical, phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy trials (ULTIMATE I and II), participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous ublituximab (150 mg on day 1, followed by 450 mg on day 15 and at weeks 24, 48, and 72) and oral placebo or oral teriflunomide (14 mg once daily) and intravenous placebo. The primary end point was the annualized relapse rate. Secondary end points included the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by 96 weeks and worsening of disability.A total of 549 participants were enrolled in the ULTIMATE I trial, and 545 were enrolled in the ULTIMATE II trial; the median follow-up was 95 weeks. In the ULTIMATE I trial, the annualized relapse rate was 0.08 with ublituximab and 0.19 with teriflunomide confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.62; P<0.001); in the ULTIMATE II trial, the annualized relapse rate was 0.09 and 0.18, respectively (rate ratio, 0.78; P=0.002). The mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions was 0.02 in the ublituximab group and 0.49 in the teriflunomide group (rate ratio, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06; P<0.001) in the ULTIMATE I trial and 0.01 and 0.25, respectively (rate ratio, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06; P<0.001), in the ULTIMATE II trial. In the pooled analysis of the two trials, 5.2% of the participants in the ublituximab group and 5.9% in the teriflunomide group had worsening of disability at 12 weeks (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.41; P=0.51). Infusion-related reactions occurred in 47.7% of the participants in the ublituximab group. Serious infections occurred in 5.0% in the ublituximab group and in 2.9% in the teriflunomide group.Among participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ublituximab resulted in lower annualized relapse rates and fewer brain lesions on MRI than teriflunomide over a period of 96 weeks but did not result in a significantly lower risk of worsening of disability. Ublituximab was associated with infusion-related reactions. (Funded by TG Therapeutics; ULTIMATE I and II ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT03277261 and NCT03277248.).

Prior exposure to endemic coronaviruses, common in young children, may protect against SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated risk of severe COVID-19 among adults with and without exposure to young children in a large, integrated healthcare system. Adults with children 0-5 years were matched 1:1 to adults with children 6-11 years, 12-18 years, and those without children based upon a COVID-19 propensity score and risk factors for severe COVID-19. COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and need for intensive care unit (ICU) were assessed in 3,126,427 adults, of whom 24% (N = 743,814) had children 18 years or younger, and 8.8% (N = 274,316) had a youngest child 0-5 years. After 1:1 matching, propensity for COVID-19 infection and risk factors for severe COVID-19 were well balanced between groups. Rates of COVID-19 infection were slightly higher for adults with exposure to older children (incident risk ratio, 1.09, 95% confidence interval, [1.05-1.12] and IRR 1.09 [1.05-1.13] for adults with children 6-11 and 12-18, respectively), compared to those with children 0-5 years, although no difference in rates of COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization or ICU admission was observed. However, adults without exposure to children had lower rates of COVID-19 infection (IRR 0.85, [0.83-0.87]) but significantly higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization (IRR 1.49, [1.29-1.73]) and hospitalization requiring ICU admission (IRR 1.76, [1.19-2.58]) compared to those with children aged 0-5. In a large, real-world population, exposure to young children was associated with less severe COVID-19 illness. Endemic coronavirus cross-immunity may play a role in protection against severe COVID-19.

ATRC-101 is an antibody that targets an extracellular, tumor-specific ribonucleoprotein complex. Here, we describe the extracellular binding of this complex and antitumor activity of ATRC-101 in murine models. Preclinical data suggest a mechanism of action in which ATRC-101 activates myeloid cells of the innate immune system, leading to an adaptive immune response that yields its antitumor activity. These data have led to an ongoing phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors.

B lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients contribute to inflammation and secrete oligoclonal immunoglobulins1,2. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been linked to MS epidemiologically, but its pathological role remains unclear3. Here we demonstrate high-affinity molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBNA1 and the CNS protein GlialCAM, and provide structural and in-vivo functional evidence for its relevance. A cross-reactive CSF-derived antibody was initially identified by single-cell sequencing of the paired-chain B cell repertoire of MS blood and CSF, followed by protein microarray-based testing of recombinantly expressed CSF-derived antibodies against MS-associated viruses. Sequence analysis, affinity measurements, and the crystal structure of the EBNA1-peptide epitope in complex with the autoreactive Fab fragment allowed for tracking the development of the nave EBNA1-restricted antibody to a mature EBNA1/GlialCAM cross-reactive antibody. Molecular mimicry is facilitated by a post-translational modification of GlialCAM. EBNA1 immunization exacerbates the mouse model of MS and anti-EBNA1/GlialCAM antibodies are prevalent in MS patients. Our results provide a mechanistic link for the association between MS and EBV, and could guide the development of novel MS therapies.

We developed novel, conditionally active biologic (CAB) anti-CTLA4 antibodies that are active only in the acidic tumor microenvironment. In healthy tissue, this binding is reversibly inhibited by a novel mechanism using physiological chemicals as protein-associated chemical switches (PaCS). No enzymes or potentially immunogenic covalent modifications to the antibody are required for activation in the tumor. The novel anti-CTLA4 antibodies show similar efficacy in animal models compared to an analog of a marketed anti-CTLA4 biologic, but have markedly reduced toxicity in nonhuman primates (in combination with an anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor), indicating a widened therapeutic index (TI). The PaCS encompass mechanisms that are applicable to a wide array of antibody formats (e.g., ADC, bispecifics) and antigens. Examples shown here include antibodies to EpCAM, Her2, Nectin4, CD73, and CD3. Existing antibodies can be engineered readily to be made sensitive to PaCS, and the inhibitory activity can be optimized for each antigen's varying expression level and tissue distribution. PaCS can modulate diverse physiological molecular interactions and are applicable to various pathologic conditions, enabling differential CAB antibody activities in normal versus disease microenvironments.

RESULTS: There is at least 1 precedent for an antibody response against a viral pathogen that fails to provide host protection in the absence of immune-competent CD4+ T cells. PML is an infection of the CNS caused by JC virus (JCV), which commonly occurs during treatment with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody natalizumab. In this context, the humoral immune response fails to prevent JCV reactivation, and elevated anti-JCV serum indices are associated with a higher PML incidence. The more relevant immune-competent cells in host defense against JCV appear to be T cells. T cell-mediated responses are also detectable in convalescing patients with SARS-COV-2 irrespective of the humoral immune response.CONCLUSION: Based on pathogenic lessons learned from PML under natalizumab therapy, we suggest the incorporation of functional assays that determine neutralizing properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In addition, we outline the potential role of T-cell detection assays in determining herd immunity in a given population or in studying therapeutic responses to vaccines.

Patient histories were gathered and included date of diagnosis of MS and psoriasis, MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), reason for DMT switch, and effects on MS and psoriasis status.RESULTS: On initiation of natalizumab, all 18 patients had a complete cessation of MS disease activity (within 2-8 months) with significant patient-reported improvement of psoriasis (within 1-5 months). This improvement was independent of previous MS therapy and led to 15 of 18 patients needing no additional treatment for MS and psoriasis (remaining 3 patients continued to use topical treatments for psoriasis).CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of 18 patients with comorbid MS and psoriasis, beneficial results on both diseases were observed after initiation of therapy with natalizumab.

This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone copies of autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic.

First, ACE2, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor, is reduced in the respiratory tract in children. Second, coronavirus associated with common colds in children may offer some protection, due to cross-reactive humoral immunity and T cell immunity between common coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Third, T helper 2 immune responses are protective in children. Fourth, surprisingly, eosinophilia, associated with T helper 2, may be protective. Fifth, children generally produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, the influence of the downturn in the global economy, the impact of living in quarters among families who are the most at risk, and factors including the openings of some schools, are considered. Those most disadvantaged socioeconomically may suffer disproportionately with COVID-19.

The clinical benefit of cell-depleting therapies targeting CD20 has emphasized the role of B cells and autoantibodies in MS pathogenesis. We previously introduced an enzyme-linked immunospot spot (ELISpot)-based assay to measure CNS antigen-specific B cells in the blood of MS patients and demonstrated its usefulness as a predictive biomarker for disease activity in measuring the successful outcome of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Here we used a planar protein array to investigate CNS-reactive antibodies in the serum of MS patients as well as in B cell culture supernatants after polyclonal stimulation. Anti-CNS antibody reactivity was evident in the sera of the MS cohort, and the antibodies bound a heterogeneous set of molecules, including myelin, axonal cytoskeleton, and ion channel antigens, in individual patients. Immunoglobulin reactivity in supernatants of stimulated B cells was directed against a broad range of CNS antigens. A group of MS patients with a highly active B cell component was identified by the ELISpot assay. Those antibody reactivities remained stable over time. These assays with protein arrays identify MS patients with a highly active B cell population with antibodies directed against a swathe of CNS proteins.

B cells are now known to play a major role in disease, demonstrated by the highly impactful effect of a B cell-depleting antibody on controlling MS. The idea that a virus may play a role in the development of MS has a long history and is supported mostly by studies demonstrating a link between B cell-tropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and disease onset. Efforts to develop antiviral strategies for treating MS are underway. Although gaps remain in our understanding of the etiology of MS, the role, if any, of viruses in propagating pathogenic immune responses deserves attention.

Antigen-specific tolerization of the immune system in protein replacement therapy for hemophilia A is an accepted treatment. Clinical trials are ongoing for autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and rheumatoid arthritis with various antigen-specific strategies. Trials for tolerization in celiac disease aim for antigen specific tolerance to gluten, an environmental trigger, which may then halt the progression to autoimmunity targeting a self-antigen, tissue transglutaminase. Although many promising approaches have been demonstrated in pre-clinical models, this review will focus primarily on clinical trials of antigen-specific tolerance that have been taken to the clinic and with initial results reported in the peer reviewed literature.

Strategies aimed at antigen-specific tolerance to these autoantigens are thus indicated for these diseases. One approach involves induction of tolerance with engineered dendritic cells (tolDCs) loaded with specific antigens. We conducted an in-human phase 1b clinical trial testing increasing concentrations of autologous tolDCs loaded with peptides from various myelin proteins and from AQP4. We tested this approach in 12 patients, 8 with MS and 4 with NMOSD. The primary end point was the safety and tolerability, while secondary end points were clinical outcomes (relapses and disability), imaging (MRI and optical coherence tomography), and immunological responses. Therapy with tolDCs was well tolerated, without serious adverse events and with no therapy-related reactions. Patients remained stable clinically in terms of relapse, disability, and in various measurements using imaging. We observed a significant increase in the production of IL-10 levels in PBMCs stimulated with the peptides as well as an increase in the frequency of a regulatory T cell, known as Tr1, by week 12 of follow-up. In this phase 1b trial, we concluded that the i.v. administration of peptide-loaded dendritic cells is safe and feasible. Elicitation of specific IL-10 production by peptide-specific T cells in MS and NMOSD patients indicates that a key element in antigen specific tolerance is activated with this approach. The results warrant further clinical testing in larger trials.

Studies on the inflammatory reflex have been instrumental for the current development of the field of bioelectronic medicine. An independent investigation of the biological role of alphaB-crystallin (HspB5), the most abundant gene transcript present in active multiple sclerosis lesions in human brains, also led to alpha7nAChR. Induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in HspB5-/- mice results in greater paralytic signs, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and T-lymphocyte activation relative to wild-type animals. Administration of HspB5 was therapeutic in animal models of multiple sclerosis, retinal and cardiac ischemia, and stroke. Structure-activity studies established that residues 73-92 were as potent as the parent protein, but only when it formed amyloid fibrils. Amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) selectively bound alpha7nAChR on peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) and B lymphocytes, converting the MPhis to an immune suppressive phenotype and mobilizing the migration of both cell types from the peritoneum to secondary lymph organs. Here, we review multiple aspects of this work, which may be of interest for developing future therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis and other disorders.

An individual with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has a genetic mutation in dystrophin, and therefore the wild-type protein is \"foreign,\" and thus potentially immunogenic. The adeno-associated virus serotype-6 (AAV6) vector for delivery of dystrophin is a viral-derived vector with its own inherent immunogenicity. We have developed a technology where an engineered plasmid DNA is delivered to reduce autoimmunity. We have taken this approach into humans, tolerizing to myelin proteins in multiple sclerosis and to proinsulin in type 1 diabetes. Here, we extend this technology to a model of gene therapy to reduce the immunogenicity of the AAV vector and of the wild-type protein product that is missing in the genetic disease. Following gene therapy with systemic administration of recombinant AAV6-microdystrophin to mdx/mTRG2 mice, we demonstrated the development of antibodies targeting dystrophin and AAV6 capsid in control mice. Treatment with the engineered DNA construct encoding microdystrophin markedly reduced antibody responses to dystrophin and to AAV6. Muscle force in the treated mice was also improved compared with control mice. These data highlight the potential benefits of administration of an engineered DNA plasmid encoding the delivered protein to overcome critical barriers in gene therapy to achieve optimal functional gene expression.

Whether these molecules modulate systemic inflammatory conditions remains unknown. We hypothesized that an amylin hexapeptide that forms fibrils can attenuate the systemic inflammatory response in a murine model of sepsis. To test this hypothesis, mice were pre-treated with either vehicle or amylin hexapeptide (20 g) at 12 hours and 6 hours prior to intraperitoneal (i.p.) lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 mg/kg) administration. Illness severity and survival were monitored every 6 hours for 3 days. Levels of pro- (IL-6, TNF-, IFN-) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines were measured via ELISA at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after LPS (i.p.). As a metric of lung injury, pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) barrier function was tested 24 hours after LPS administration by comparing lung wet-to-dry ratios, Evan's blue dye (EBD) extravasation, lung histology activity. Compared to controls, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide significantly reduced mortality (p<0.05 at 72 h), illness severity (p<0.05), and pro-inflammatory cytokine Amylin pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, as demonstrated by decreased lung water and caspase-3 activity (p<0.05, versus PBS). Hence, in a murine model of systemic inflammation, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide reduced mortality, disease severity, and preserved lung barrier function. Amylin hexapeptide may represent a novel therapeutic tool to mitigate sepsis severity and lung injury.

The presence of EBV-infected cells was further confirmed by in situ hybridization to detect the EBV RNA transcript, EBV-encoded RNA-1 (EBER-1).Results: We report the presence of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) in 93% of MS and 78% of control brains, with a greater percentage of MS brains containing CD138+ plasma cells and LMP-1-rich populations. Notably, 78% of chronic MS lesions and 33.3% of non-MS brains contained parenchymal gene (BZLF1), was also observed in 46% of MS, primarily in association with chronic lesions and 44% of non-MS brain tissue. Furthermore, 85% of MS brains revealed frequent EBER-positive cells, whereas non-MS brains seldom contained EBER-positive cells. EBV infection was detectable, by immunohistochemistry and by in situ hybridization, in both MS and non-MS brains, although latent virus was more prevalent in MS brains, while lytic virus was restricted to chronic MS lesions.Conclusions: Together, our observations suggest an uncharacterized link between the EBV virus life cycle and MS pathogenesis.

They reduce clinical paralysis and induce immunosuppressive pathways, diminishing inflammation. A key question was the identification of the target for these molecules. When sHsps and amyloid fibrils were chemically cross-linked to immune cells, a limited number of proteins were precipitated, including the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 NAChR). The alpha7 NAChR is noteworthy among the over 20 known receptors for amyloid fibrils, because it plays a central role in a well-defined immune-suppressive pathway. Competitive binding between amyloid fibrils and alpha-bungarotoxin to peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) confirmed the involvement of alpha7 NAChR. The mechanism of immune suppression was explored, and, similar to nicotine, amyloid fibrils inhibited LPS induction of a common set of inflammatory cytokines while inducing Stat3 signaling and autophagy. Consistent with this, previous studies have established that nicotine, sHsps, and amyloid fibrils all were effective therapeutics in EAE. Interestingly, B lymphocytes were needed for the therapeutic effect. These results suggest that agonists of alpha7 NAChR might have therapeutic benefit for a variety of inflammatory diseases.

Sixty years after the disease was first described, the preferred and best treatment option for RE is grotesque and involves removing a hemisphere of the brain (hemispherectomy); therefore, a better understanding of this seizure disorder may provide additional, less invasive therapeutic options. In this issue of the JCI, Carmant and colleagues have developed an animal model of this focal seizure disorder. The model provides experimental insights into the pathogenesis of RE and potential new treatments for this disease.

Brain myeloid cells, particularly microglia, play key roles in these conditions. We employed single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to compare myeloid cell populations in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, the R6/2 model of Huntington's disease (HD) and the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We identified three myeloid cell populations exclusive to the CNS and present in each disease model. Blood-derived monocytes comprised five populations and migrated to the brain in EAE, but not in HD and ALS models. Single-cell analysis resolved differences in signaling and cytokine production within similar myeloid populations in EAE compared to HD and ALS models. Moreover, these analyses highlighted alpha5 integrin on myeloid cells as a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation. Together, these findings illustrate how neuropathology may differ between inflammatory and degenerative brain disease.

The monographs recount the seminal events as told in the voice of the original investigators who provided the crucial early insight. These essays capture the essence of discovery, chronicling the birth of ideas that created new fields of research; and launched trajectories that persisted and ultimately influenced how disease is prevented, diagnosed, and treated.

The bile acid-FXR interaction regulates bile acid synthesis, transport, and cholesterol metabolism. Recently, bile acid-FXR regulation has been reported to play an integral role in both hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and in atherosclerosis. In this study, we found that FXR knockout mice had more disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Obeticholic acid (6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, 6-ECDCA), a synthetic FXR agonist, is an orally available drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. When we treated mice exhibiting established EAE with 6-ECDCA, or the natural FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), clinical disease was lymphocyte activation and proinflammatory cytokine production; (ii) reducing CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cell populations and their expression of negative checkpoint regulators programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and B and T lymphocyte (BTLA); T cells and BTLA expression; and (iv) reducing VLA-4 expression in both the T- and B-cell populations. Moreover, adoptive transfer of 6-ECDCA- or CDCA-treated donor cells failed to transfer disease in naive recipients. Thus, we show that FXR functions as a negative regulator in neuroinflammation and we highlight that FXR agonists represent a potential previously unidentified therapy for MS.

Intraperitoneal injection of fibrils selectively activates B-1a lymphocytes and two populations of resident macrophages (Ms), increasing IL-10 production, and triggering their exodus from the peritoneum. The importance of IL-10-producing B-1a cells in this effective therapy was established in loss-of-function experiments where neither B-cell-deficient (MT) nor IL10(-/-) mice with EAE responded to the fibrils. In gain-of-function experiments, B-1a cells, adoptively transferred to MT mice with EAE, restored their therapeutic efficacy when Amylin 28-33 was administered. Stimulation of adoptively transferred bioluminescent Ms and B-1a cells by amyloid fibrils resulted in rapid (within 60 min of injection) trafficking of both cell types to draining lymph nodes. Analysis of gene expression indicated that the fibrils activated the CD40/B-cell receptor pathway in B-1a cells and induced a set of immune-suppressive cell-surface proteins, including BTLA, IRF4, and Siglec G. Collectively, these data indicate that the fibrils activate B-1a cells and F4/80(+) Ms, resulting in their migration to the lymph nodes, where IL-10 and cell-surface receptors associated with immune-suppression limit antigen presentation and T-cell activation. These mechanisms culminate in reduction of paralytic signs of EAE.

Narcolepsy was associated with Pandemrix vaccination (an adjuvanted, influenza pandemic vaccine) and also with infection by influenza virus during the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic. In contrast, very few cases were reported after Focetria vaccination (a differently manufactured adjuvanted influenza pandemic vaccine). We hypothesized that differences between these vaccines (which are derived from inactivated influenza viral proteins) explain the association of narcolepsy with Pandemrix-vaccinated subjects. A mimic peptide was identified from a surface-exposed region of influenza nucleoprotein A that shared protein residues in common with a fragment of the first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2. A significant proportion of sera from HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype-positive narcoleptic Finnish patients with a history of Pandemrix vaccination (vaccine-associated narcolepsy) contained antibodies to hypocretin receptor 2 compared to sera from nonnarcoleptic individuals with either 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza infection or history of Focetria vaccination. Antibodies from vaccine-associated narcolepsy sera cross-reacted with both influenza nucleoprotein and hypocretin receptor 2, which was demonstrated by competitive binding using 21-mer peptide (containing the identified nucleoprotein mimic) and 55-mer recombinant peptide (first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2) on cell lines expressing human hypocretin receptor 2. Mass spectrometry indicated that relative to Pandemrix, Focetria contained 72.7% less influenza nucleoprotein. In accord, no durable antibody responses to nucleoprotein were detected in sera from Focetria-vaccinated nonnarcoleptic subjects. Thus, differences in vaccine nucleoprotein content and respective immune response may explain the narcolepsy association with Pandemrix.

Investigation of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) reveals a coordinated molecular response involving various proteins and small molecules ranging from heat shock proteins to small lipids, neurotransmitters, and even gases, which provide protection and foster repair. Reduction of inflammation serves as a necessary prerequisite for effective recovery and regeneration. Remarkably, many lesion-resident molecules activate pathways leading to both suppression of inflammation and promotion of repair mechanisms. These guardian molecules and their corresponding physiologic pathways could potentially be exploited to silence inflammation and repair the injured and degenerating brain and spinal cord in both relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MS and may be beneficial in other neurologic and psychiatric conditions.

Immunosuppression arises from at least two pathways: (1) expression of type 1 IFN by pDCs, which were induced by neutrophil extracellular traps arising from the endocytosis of the fibrils; and (2) the reduced expression of IFN-, TNF, and IL-6. The two independent pathways stimulated by the fibrils can act in concert to be immunosuppressive in Th1 indications, or in opposition, resulting in inflammation when Th17 T lymphocytes are predominant. The generation of type 1 IFN can be minimized by using polar, nonionizable, amyloidogenic peptides, which are effective in both Th1 and Th17 polarized EAE.

This period of fluctuating disease may last for a decade or more. Clinical relapses reflect acute inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and spinal cord. Often, different anatomic areas in the CNS are involved each time a relapse occurs, resulting in varied clinical manifestations in each instance. Relapses are nearly always followed by some degree of remission, though recovery to baseline status before the flare is often incomplete. There are nine approved drugs for treatment of RRMS. The most potent drug for inhibiting relapses, the humanized anti-4 integrin antibody known as Natalizumab, blocks homing of mononuclear cells to the CNS. The mechanisms of action of the approved drugs for RRMS provide a strong foundation for understanding the pathobiology of the relapse. Despite substantial progress in controlling relapses with the current armamentarium of medications, there is much to learn and ever more effective and safe therapies to develop.

The sphingosine phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist FTY-720 (Gilenya) arrests immune trafficking and prevents multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. However, alternative mechanisms of S1P-S1P1 signaling have been reported. Phosphoproteomic analysis of MS brain lesions revealed S1P1 phosphorylation on S351, a residue crucial for receptor internalization. Mutant mice harboring an S1pr1 gene encoding phosphorylation-deficient receptors (S1P1(S5A)) developed severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) due to autoimmunity mediated by interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells (TH17 cells) in the peripheral immune and nervous system. S1P1 directly activated the Jak-STAT3 signal-transduction pathway via IL-6. Impaired S1P1 phosphorylation enhances TH17 polarization and exacerbates autoimmune neuroinflammation.

A therapy for T1D that targets the specific autoimmune response in this disease while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact, has long been sought. Proinsulin is a major target of the adaptive immune response in T1D. We hypothesized that an engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin (BHT-3021) would preserve cell function in T1D patients through reduction of insulin-specific CD8(+) T cells. We studied 80 subjects over 18 years of age who were diagnosed with T1D within the past 5 years. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive intramuscular injections of BHT-3021 or BHT-placebo, weekly for 12 weeks, and then monitored for safety and immune responses in a blinded fashion. Four dose levels of BHT-3021 were evaluated: 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg. C-peptide was used both as an exploratory efficacy measure and as a safety measure. Islet-specific CD8(+) T cell frequencies were assessed with multimers of monomeric human leukocyte antigen class I molecules loaded with peptides from pancreatic and unrelated antigens. No serious adverse events related to BHT-3021 were observed. C-peptide levels improved relative to placebo at all doses, at 1 mg at the 15-week time point (+19.5% BHT-3021 versus -8.8% BHT-placebo, P < 0.026). Proinsulin-reactive CD8(+) T cells, but not T cells against unrelated islet or foreign molecules, declined in the BHT-3021 arm (P < 0.006). No significant changes were noted in interferon-, interleukin-4 (IL-4), or IL-10 production in CD4 T cells. Thus, we demonstrate that a plasmid encoding proinsulin reduces the frequency of CD8(+) T cells reactive to proinsulin while preserving C-peptide over the course of dosing.

In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.

Our previous work established that amyloidogenic peptides from the small heat shock protein B crystallin (HspB5) and from amyloid fibrils, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, were therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reflecting aspects of the pathology of MS. To understand the molecular basis for the therapeutic effect, we showed a set of amyloidogenic peptides composed of six amino acids, including those from tau, amyloid A4, major prion protein (PrP), HspB5, amylin, serum amyloid P, and insulin B chain, to be anti-inflammatory and capable of reducing serological levels of interleukin-6 and attenuating paralysis in EAE. The chaperone function of the fibrils correlates with the therapeutic outcome. Fibrils composed of tau 623-628 precipitated 49 plasma proteins, including apolipoprotein B-100, clusterin, transthyretin, and complement C3, supporting the hypothesis that the fibrils are active biological agents. Amyloid fibrils thus may provide benefit in MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders.

We designed an undergraduate neuroimmunology course that uses a writing-intensive format. Using a mixture of primary literature, writing assignments directed toward a layperson and scientist audience, and in-class discussions, we aimed to improve the ability of students to 1) comprehend primary scientific papers, 2) communicate science to a scientific audience, and 3) communicate science to a layperson audience. We offered the course for three consecutive years and evaluated its impact on student perception and confidence using a combination of pre- and postcourse survey questions and coded open-ended responses. Students showed gains in both the perception of their understanding of primary scientific papers and of their abilities to communicate science to scientific and layperson audiences. These results indicate that this unique format can teach both communication skills and basic science to undergraduate biology students. We urge others to adopt a similar format for undergraduate biology courses to teach process skills in addition to content, thus broadening and strengthening the impact of undergraduate courses.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor are critical for the pathogenesis of inflammation in specific brain disorders. Targeting these cytokines or their receptors can alter the course of several neurological diseases, but the effects may be beneficial or harmful.

The Male/Female Disparity: Why are women developing MS so much more frequently than men? 2. Neuronal and Glial Protection: Are there guardian molecules that protect the nervous system in MS? 3. Predictive Medicine: With all the approved drugs, how can we rationally decide which one to use? 4. The Precise Scalpel vs. the Big Hammer for Therapy: Is antigen-specific therapy for demyelinating disease possible? To emphasize how our views on the pathogenesis and treatment of MS are evolving, and given the location of the talk in Amsterdam, Piet Mondrian's progressive interpretations of trees serve as a heuristic.

There is strong evidence that an immune response in the brain is a critical component of the disease. In 1992, in a collaboration between academia and biotechnology, my colleagues and I showed that 4 integrin was the critical molecule involved in the homing of immune cells into the inflamed brain. Was it sheer luck that these results led to the development of a drug for MS?

Each of the recombinant proteins was shown to be a functional chaperone, capable of inhibiting aggregation of denatured insulin with varying efficiency. When injected into mice at the peak of disease, they were all effective in reducing the paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Additional structure activity correlations between chaperone activity and therapeutic function were established when linear regions within HspB5 were examined. A single region, corresponding to residues 73-92 of HspB5, forms amyloid fibrils, exhibited chaperone activity, and was an effective therapeutic for encephalomyelitis. The linkage of the three activities was further established by demonstrating individual substitutions of critical hydrophobic amino acids in the peptide resulted in the loss of all of the functions.

In multiple sclerosis, A42 is up-regulated in brain lesions and damaged axons. We found, unexpectedly, that treatment with either A42 or A40 peptides reduced motor paralysis and brain inflammation in four different models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with attenuation of motor paralysis, reduction of inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), and suppression of lymphocyte activation. A42 and A40 treatments were effective in reducing ongoing paralysis induced with adoptive transfer of either autoreactive T helper 1 (T(H)1) or T(H)17 cells. High-dimensional 14-parameter flow cytometry of peripheral immune cell populations after in vivo A42 and A40 treatment revealed substantial modulations in the percentage of lymphoid and myeloid subsets during EAE. Major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were reduced in the blood after A peptide treatment. Protection conferred by A treatment did not require its delivery to the brain: Adoptive transfer with lymphocytes from donors treated with A42 attenuated EAE in wild-type recipient mice, and A deposition in the brain was not detected in treated EAE mice by immunohistochemical analysis. In contrast to the improvement in EAE with A treatment, EAE was worse in mice with genetic deletion of the amyloid precursor protein. Therefore, in the absence of A, there is exacerbated clinical EAE disease progression. Because A42 and A40 ameliorate experimental autoimmune inflammation targeting the CNS, we might now consider its potential anti-inflammatory role in other neuropathological conditions.

Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that CD47 is expressed in normal myelin and in foamy macrophages and reactive astrocytes within active MS lesions. We demonstrate that CD47(-/-) mice are refractory to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), primarily as the result of failure of immune cell activation after immunization with myelin antigen. In contrast, blocking with a monoclonal antibody against CD47 in mice at the peak of paralysis worsens EAE severity and enhances immune activation in the peripheral immune system. In vitro assays demonstrate that blocking CD47 also promotes phagocytosis of myelin and that this effect is dependent on signal regulatory protein (SIRP-). Immune regulation and phagocytosis are mechanisms for CD47 signaling in autoimmune neuroinflammation. Depending on the cell type, location, and disease stage, CD47 has Janus-like roles, with opposing effects on EAE pathogenesis.

We used lipid antigen microarrays and lipid mass spectrometry to identify bona fide lipid targets of the autoimmune response in MS brain, and an animal model of MS to explore the role of the identified lipids in autoimmune demyelination. We found that autoantibodies in MS target a phosphate group in phosphatidylserine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine derivatives. Administration of these lipids ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing activation and inducing apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, effects mediated by the lipids' saturated fatty acid side chains. Thus, phospholipids represent a natural anti-inflammatory class of compounds that have potential as therapeutics for MS.

Furthermore, IFN- treatment worsens NMO. We recently found that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced with Th17 cells is exacerbated by IFN-, in contrast to disease induced with Th1 where treatment attenuated symptoms.This study demonstrates the similarities between NMO and Th17 EAE and how neutrophils mediate pathology in Th17 disease.Levels of blood biomarkers in NMO were assessed by Luminex and ELISA. Effects of IFN- on neutrophils were assessed by culture assays and immunofluorescence. EAE was induced by transfer of myelin-specific Th1 or Th17 cells and treated and neutrophil elastase are elevated in patients with definitive NMO. In culture, we find that IFN- stimulates neutrophils to release neutrophil elastase. In Th17 EAE, we demonstrate neutrophilic infiltration in the optic nerve and spinal cord which was not present in Th1 EAE. Blockade of neutrophil elastase with Sivelestat had efficacy in Th17 EAE but not Th1 EAE.The similarities between Th17 EAE and NMO indicate that this model represents several aspects of NMO. Neutrophils are critical in the pathologies of both Th17-EAE and NMO, and therefore blockade of neutrophil elastase is a promising target in treating NMO.

By mass spectral analysis, a common set of 70 ligands was precipitated by HspB5 from plasma from patients with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis and mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These proteins were distinguished from other precipitated molecules because they were enriched in the precipitate as compared with their plasma concentrations, and they exhibited temperature-dependent binding. More than half of these ligands were acute phase proteins or members of the complement or coagulation cascades. Consistent with this proposal, plasma levels of HspB5 were increased in patients with multiple sclerosis as compared with normal individuals. The combination of the thermal sensitivity of the HspB5 combined with the high local concentration of these ligands at the site of inflammation is proposed to explain the paradox of how a protein believed to exhibit nonspecific binding can bind with some relative apparent selectivity to proinflammatory proteins and thereby modulate inflammation.

This report describes a unique target for effective treatment of stroke, even 12 h after onset, by the administration of B-crystallin (Cryab), an endogenous immunomodulatory neuroprotectant. In Cryab(-/-) mice, there was increased lesion size and diminished neurologic function after stroke compared with wild-type mice. Increased plasma Cryab was detected after experimental stroke in mice and after stroke in human patients. Administration of Cryab even 12 h after experimental stroke reduced both stroke volume and inflammatory cytokines associated with stroke pathology. Cryab is an endogenous anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectant molecule produced after stroke, whose beneficial properties can be augmented when administered therapeutically after stroke.

We studied early changes following experimental AION and tested the benefit of a potential treatment.Materials andWe induced experimental AION in adult mice and tested the effects of short-term (daily for 3 days) and long-term (every other day for 3 weeks) B-crystallin (BC) treatment using histological and serial intracranial flash visual evoked potential recordings.One day after experimental AION, there was swelling at the optic nerve (ON) head and increased expression of BC, a small heat shock protein important in ischemia and inflammation. This upregulation coincided with microglial and astrocytic activation. Our hypothesis was that BC may be part of the endogenous protective mechanism against injury, thus we tested the effects of BC on experimental AION. Daily intraveneous or intravitreal BC injections did not improve visual evoked potential amplitude or latency at days 1-2. However, BC treatment decreased swelling and dampened the microglial and astrocytic activation on day 3. Longer treatment with intravenous BC led to acceleration of visual evoked potential latency over 3 weeks, without improving amplitude. This latency acceleration did not correlate with increased retinal ganglion cell survival but did correlate with complete rescue of the ON oligodendrocytes, which are important for myelination.We identified BC as an early marker following experimental AION. Treatment with BC enhanced this endogenous, post-ischemic response by decreasing microglial activation and promoting ON oligodendrocyte survival.

In some cases, IFN- exacerbates MS, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO). To eliminate unnecessary treatment for patients who are non-responsive to IFN-, and to avoid possible harm, researchers are identifying biomarkers that predict treatment outcome before treatment is initiated. These biomarkers reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease.

However, there have been several scientific inconsistencies with this assignment, ranging from studies demonstrating small differences in anticrystallin responses between patients and healthy individuals to the inability of crystallin-specific T cells to induce symptoms of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in animal models. Experiments in this article demonstrate that the putative anti-HspB5 Abs from 23 MS patients cross-react with 7 other members of the human small Hsp family and were equally present in normal plasma. Biolayer interferometry demonstrates that the binding was temperature dependent, and that the calculated K(a) increased as the concentration of the sHsp decreased. These two patterns are characteristic of multiple binding sites with varying affinities, the composition of which changes with temperature, supporting the hypothesis that HspB5 bound the Ab and not the reverse. HspB5 also precipitated Ig heavy and L chains from sera from patients with MS. These results establish that small Hsps bind Igs with high affinity and refute much of the serological data used to assign B-crystallin as an autoantigen.

Previously, it was reported that treatment of mice with a synthetic ligand activator of PPAR-delta, GW0742, ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating a possible role for this nuclear receptor in the control of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune inflammation. We show that mice deficient in PPAR-delta (PPAR-delta(-/-)) develop a severe inflammatory response during EAE characterized by a striking accumulation of IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(-) and IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(+) CD4(+) cells in the spinal cord. The preferential expansion of these T helper subsets in the CNS of PPAR-delta(-/-) mice occurred as a result of a constellation of immune system aberrations that included higher CD4(+) cell proliferation, cytokine production, and T-bet expression and enhanced expression of IL-12 family cytokines by myeloid cells. We also show that the effect of PPAR-delta in inhibiting the production of IFN-gamma and IL-12 family cytokines is ligand dependent and is observed in both mouse and human immune cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that PPAR-delta serves as an important molecular brake for the control of autoimmune inflammation.

However, this treatment is not always effective. Here we have found congruence in outcome between responses to IFN-beta in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). IFN-beta was effective in reducing EAE symptoms induced by T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells but exacerbated disease induced by T(H)17 cells. Effective treatment in T(H)1-induced EAE correlated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by splenocytes. In T(H)17-induced disease, the amount of IL-10 was unaltered by treatment, although, unexpectedly, IFN-beta treatment still reduced IL-17 production without benefit. Both inhibition of IL-17 and induction of IL-10 depended on IFN-gamma. In the absence of IFN-gamma signaling, IFN-beta therapy was ineffective in EAE. In RRMS patients, IFN-beta nonresponders had higher IL-17F concentrations in serum compared to responders. Nonresponders had worse disease with more steroid usage and more relapses than did responders. Hence, IFN-beta is proinflammatory in T(H)17-induced EAE. Moreover, a high IL-17F concentration in the serum of people with RRMS is associated with nonresponsiveness to therapy with IFN-beta.

We demonstrate that immune cells synthesize GABA and have the machinery for GABA catabolism. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) express functional GABA receptors and respond electrophysiologically to GABA. Thus, the immune system harbors all of the necessary constituents for GABA signaling, and GABA itself may function as a paracrine or autocrine factor. These observations led us to ask further whether manipulation of the GABA pathway influences an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Increasing GABAergic activity ameliorates ongoing paralysis in EAE via inhibition of inflammation. GABAergic agents act directly on APCs, decreasing MAPK signals and diminishing subsequent adaptive inflammatory responses to myelin proteins.

Studies of autoimmune brain disorders have aided in the elucidation of distinct neuronal roles played by key molecules already well known to immunologists (e.g., complement and components of the major histocompatibility complex). In parallel, molecules known to neurobiology and sensory physiology, including toll-like receptors, gamma amino butyric acid and the lens protein alpha B crystallin, have intriguing and distinct functions in the immune system, where they modulate autoimmunity directed to the brain.

The octapeptide angiotensin II (AII) is proteolytically processed from the decapeptide AI by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and then acts via angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R). Inhibitors of ACE and antagonists of the AT1R are used in the treatment of hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We now show that the RAAS also plays a major role in autoimmunity, exemplified by multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using proteomics, we observed that RAAS is up-regulated in brain lesions of MS. AT1R was induced in myelin-specific CD4+ T cells and monocytes during autoimmune neuroinflammation. Blocking AII production with ACE inhibitors or inhibiting AII signaling with AT1R blockers suppressed autoreactive TH1 and TH17 cells and CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory cells (Treg cells) with inhibition of the canonical NF-kappaB1 transcription factor complex and activation of the alternative NF-kappaB2 pathway. Treatment with ACE inhibitors induces abundant CD4+FoxP3+ T cells with sufficient potency to reverse paralytic EAE. Modulation of the RAAS with inexpensive, safe pharmaceuticals used by millions worldwide is an attractive therapeutic strategy for application to human autoimmune diseases.

Striking clinical recovery, termed remission, often follows these periodic neurological defects, termed relapses. Recent work has revealed the role of three key molecules in relapse and remission: alpha4beta1 integrin (also known as VLA4) is an adhesion molecule that mediates T cell migration from the blood into the brain; osteopontin binds to alpha4beta1 integrin, stimulating the cytokines and inhibiting apoptosis; and alphaB crystallin inhibits inflammation in the brain. This Review discusses how this molecular trio interacts to initiate relapses (in the case of osteopontin and alpha4beta1 integrin) and then to terminate them as remissions in multiple sclerosis (in the case of alphaB crystallin).

A plasmid DNA vaccine encoding mouse proinsulin II reduced the incidence of diabetes in a mouse model of type I diabetes when administered to hyperglycemic (therapeutic mode) or normoglycemic (prophylactic mode) NOD mice. Therapeutic administration of proinsulin DNA was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the number of insulin-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells, whereas prophylactic treatment was accompanied by enhanced IFN-gamma-secreting cells and a decrease in insulin autoantibodies. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that the protection was not mediated by induction of CD25(+)/CD4(+) T regulatory cells. The efficacy of the DNA vaccine was enhanced by increasing the level of expression of the encoded Ag, more frequent dosing, increasing dose level, and localization of the protein product to the intracellular compartment. The efficacy data presented in this study demonstrate that Ag-specific plasmid DNA therapy is a viable strategy for preventing progression of type I diabetes and defines critical parameters of the dosing regime that influences tolerance induction.

As reviewed here, cytokines are critical in the induction of fever, the pathogenesis of MS, and the pathobiology of AD. Indeed, antibodies targeting cytokines have been used as a therapy for individuals with unusual and persistent febrile reactions not responsive to common antipyretics, while a recombinant cytokine is the most popular treatment for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. Although cytokine-modulating therapies are not currently in clinical use for the treatment of AD, cytokines can ameliorate disease pathology in certain experimental models of AD, suggesting a potential for future therapeutic opportunities.

Relapsing-remitting MS patients were randomized 1:1:1 into three groups: placebo, 0.5 mg BHT-3009, or 1.5 mg BHT-3009, given intramuscularly at weeks 0, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter until week 44. The primary end point was the 4-week rate of occurrence of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance images from weeks 28 to 48. Protein microarrays were used to measure levels of anti-myelin autoantibodies.Compared with placebo, in the 267 patient analysis population the median 4-week rate of new enhancing lesions during weeks 28 to 48 was 50% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.07) and during weeks 8 to 48 was 61% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.05). The mean volume of enhancing lesions at week 48 was 51% lower on 0.5 mg BHT-3009 compared with placebo (p = 0.02). No significant improvement in magnetic resonance imaging lesion parameters was observed with 1.5 mg BHT-3009. Dramatic reductions in 23 myelin-specific autoantibodies in the 0.5 mg BHT-3009 arm were observed, but not with placebo or 1.5 mg BHT-3009.In relapsing-remitting MS patients, treatment with the lower dose (0.5 mg) of BHT-3009 for 44 weeks nearly attained the primary end point for reduction of the rate of new enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions (p = 0.07) and achieved several secondary end points including a reduction of the rate of enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions from weeks 8 to 48 (p = 0.05). Immunological data in a preselected subgroup of patients also indicated that treatment with 0.5 mg induced antigen-specific immune tolerance. The greater dose was ineffective.

Therefore, identification of targets specific to pathological types of MS may have therapeutic benefits. Here we identify, by laser-capture microdissection and proteomics, proteins unique to three major types of MS lesions: acute plaque, chronic active plaque and chronic plaque. Comparative proteomic profiles identified tissue factor and protein C inhibitor within chronic active plaque samples, suggesting dysregulation of molecules associated with coagulation. In vivo administration of hirudin or recombinant activated protein C reduced disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and suppressed Th1 and Th17 cytokines in astrocytes and immune cells. Administration of mutant forms of recombinant activated protein C showed that both its anticoagulant and its signalling functions were essential for optimal amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. A proteomic approach illuminated potential therapeutic targets selective for specific pathological stages of MS and implicated participation of the coagulation cascade.

Subjects receiving placebo were crossed over into an active arm after treatment unblinding.The trial was conducted at 4 academic institutions within North America. Patients Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS who were not taking any other disease-modifying drugs were enrolled in the trial. Further, the patients were required to have either 1 to 5 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on screening brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a relapse in the previous 2 years, or disease worsening in the previous 2 years.BHT-3009 was administered as intramuscular injections at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9 after randomization into the trial, with or without 80 mg of daily oral atorvastatin calcium in combination. Three dose levels of BHT-3009 were tested (0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, and 3 mg).The primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability of BHT-3009. Secondary outcome measures included the number and volume of gadolinium-enhanced lesions on MRI, relapses, and analysis of antigen-specific immune responses.BHT-3009 was safe and well tolerated, provided favorable trends on brain MRI, and produced beneficial antigen-specific immune changes. These immune changes consisted of a marked decrease in proliferation of interferon-gamma-producing, myelin-reactive CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and a reduction in titers of myelin-specific autoantibodies from cerebral spinal fluid as assessed by protein microarrays. We did not observe a substantial benefit of the atorvastatin combination compared with BHT-3009 alone.In patients with MS, BHT-3009 is safe and induces antigen-specific immune tolerance with concordant reduction of inflammatory lesions on brain MRI.

This crystallin has anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective functions. CRYAB is the major target of CD4+ T-cell immunity to the myelin sheath from multiple sclerosis brain. The pathophysiological implications of this immune response were investigated here. We demonstrate that CRYAB is a potent negative regulator acting as a brake on several inflammatory pathways in both the immune system and central nervous system (CNS). Cryab-/- mice showed worse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at the acute and progressive phases, with higher Th1 and Th17 cytokine secretion from T cells and macrophages, and more intense CNS inflammation, compared with their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, Cryab-/- astrocytes showed more cleaved caspase-3 TUNEL an anti-apoptotic function of Cryab. Antibody to CRYAB was detected in cerebrospinal fluid from multiple sclerosis patients and in sera from mice with EAE. Administration of recombinant CRYAB ameliorated EAE. Thus, the immune response against a negative regulator of inflammation, CRYAB, in multiple sclerosis, would exacerbate inflammation and demyelination. This can be countered by giving CRYAB itself for therapy of ongoing disease.

PPARalpha also functions to control inflammatory responses by repressing the activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-jun in immune cells. Because PPARalpha is situated at the crossroads of gender and immune regulation, we hypothesized that this gene may mediate sex differences in the development of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We show that PPARalpha is more abundant in male as compared with female CD4(+) cells and that its expression is sensitive to androgen levels. Genetic ablation of this gene selectively removed the brake on NF-kappaB and c-jun activity in male T lymphocytes, resulting in higher production of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor (but not interleukin 17), and lower production of T helper (Th)2 cytokines. Upon induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, male but not female PPARalpha(-/-) mice developed more severe clinical signs that were restricted to the acute phase of disease. These results suggest that males are less prone to develop Th1-mediated autoimmunity because they have higher T cell expression of PPARalpha.

T-helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells-long thought to mediate tissue damage-might be involved in the initiation of damage, but they do not sustain or play a decisive role in many commonly studied models of autoimmunity, allergy and microbial immunity. A major role for the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) has now been described in various models of immune-mediated tissue injury, including organ-specific autoimmunity in the brain, heart, synovium and intestines, allergic disorders of the lung and skin, and microbial infections of the intestines and the nervous system. A pathway named T(H)17 is now credited for causing and sustaining tissue damage in these diverse situations. The T(H)1 pathway antagonizes the T(H)17 pathway in an intricate fashion. The evolution of our understanding of the T(H)17 pathway illuminates a shift in immunologists' perspectives regarding the basis of tissue damage, where for over 20 years the role of T(H)1 cells was considered paramount.

Osteopontin (Opn), which is expressed in multiple sclerosis lesions, is increased in patients' plasma during relapses. Here, in models of multiple sclerosis including relapsing, progressive and multifocal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Opn triggered recurrent relapses, promoted worsening paralysis and induced neurological deficits, including optic neuritis. Increased inflammation followed Opn administration, whereas its absence resulted in more cell death of brain-infiltrating lymphocytes. Opn promoted the survival of activated T cells by inhibiting the transcription factor Foxo3a, by activating the transcription factor NF-kappaB through induction of phosphorylation of the kinase IKKbeta and by altering expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bak and Bax. Those mechanisms collectively suppressed the death of myelin-reactive T cells, linking Opn to the relapses and insidious progression characterizing multiple sclerosis.

Blockade of this enzyme by atorvastatin (AT) inhibits the destructive proinflammatory T helper cell (Th)1 response during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here we present evidence linking specific isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway to signaling pathways that regulate T cell autoimmunity. We demonstrate that the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) mediates proliferation, whereas both GGPP and its precursor, farnesyl-PP, regulate the Th1 differentiation of myelin-reactive T cells. Depletion of these isoprenoid intermediates in vivo via oral AT administration hindered these T cell responses by decreasing geranylgeranylated RhoA and farnesylated Ras at the plasma membrane. This was associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 phosphorylation and DNA binding of their cotarget c-fos in response to T cell receptor activation. Inhibition of ERK and p38 mimicked the effects of AT and induced a Th2 cytokine shift. Thus, by connecting isoprenoid availability to regulation of Th1/Th2 fate, we have elucidated a mechanism by which AT may suppress Th1-mediated central nervous system autoimmune disease.

To perform large-scale multiplex analysis of antibody responses to lipids in multiple sclerosis, we developed microarrays composed of lipids present in the myelin sheath, including ganglioside, sulfatide, cerebroside, sphingomyelin and total brain fractions. Lipid-array showed lipid-specific antibodies against sulfatide, sphingomyelin and oxidized lipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from individuals with multiple sclerosis. Sulfatide-specific antibodies were also detected in SJL/J mice with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of mice with sulfatide plus myelin peptide resulted in a more severe disease course of EAE, and administration of sulfatide-specific antibody exacerbated EAE. Thus, autoimmune responses to sulfatide and other lipids are present in individuals with multiple sclerosis and in EAE, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune demyelination.

These studies were conducted with SJL mice, an inbred strain that is highly susceptible to the induction of these diseases. Here we show that injection of monoclonal anti-I-A antibody in the amounts used for the above studies rapidly depletes B cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) multiparameter analysis of the B-cell subpopulations in treated animals shows that maximum depletion occurs around 5 days after treatment and that recovery of some subpopulations i still incomplete 1 month later. SJL mice are more sensitive to this B-cell depletion and recover more slowly than putatively normal C3H.Ighb (CKB) mice. Some components of the primary, secondary and tertiary IgG antibody responses are reduced in anti-I-A-treated SJL animals immunized after the first and second anti-I-A injections.

Higher plasma vitamin D levels have been linked to lower risk of inflammatory brain lesions. We assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral vitamin D dosing regimens in boys and young men with ALD.In this open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study, we recruited boys and young men with ALD without brain lesions to a 12-month study of daily oral vitamin D3 supplementation. Our primary outcome was attainment of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in target range (40-80 ng/mL) at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included safety and glutathione levels in the brain, measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and blood, measured via mass spectrometry. Participants were initially assigned to a fixed dosing regimen starting at 2,000 IU daily, regardless of weight. After a midstudy safety assessment, we modified the dosing regimen, so all subsequent participants were assigned to a weight-stratified dosing regimen starting as low as 1,000 IU daily.Between October 2016 and June 2019, we enrolled 21 participants (n = 12, fixed-dose regimen; n = 9, weight-stratified regimen) with a median age of 6.7 years (range: 1.9-22 years) and median weight of 20 kg (range: 11.7-85.5 kg). The number of participants achieving target vitamin D levels was similar in both groups at 6 months (fixed dose: 92%; weight stratified: 78%) and 12 months (fixed dose: 67%; weight stratified: 67%). Among the 12 participants in the fixed-dose regimen, half had asymptomatic elevations in either urine calcium:creatinine or plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D; no laboratory deviations occurred with the weight-stratified regimen. Glutathione levels in the brain, but not the blood, increased significantly between baseline and 12 months.Our vitamin D dosing regimens were well tolerated and achieved target 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in most participants. Brain glutathione levels warrant further study as a biomarker for vitamin D and ALD.This study provides Class IV evidence that fixed or weight-stratified vitamin D supplementation achieved target levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in boys and young men with X-ALD without brain lesions.

Her MRI demonstrated T2 abnormalities characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS) (white matter ovoid lesions and Dawson fingers), and CSF demonstrated an elevated IgG index and oligoclonal bands restricted to the CSF. Diagnosed with clinically definite relapsing-remitting MS, she was treated with various MS disease-modifying therapies and eventually began experiencing secondary progression. At age 57 years, she developed an acute longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and was found to have AQP4 antibodies by cell-based assay. Our analysis of the clinical course, radiographic findings, molecular diagnostic methods, and treatment response characteristics support the hypothesis that our patient most likely had 2 CNS inflammatory disorders: MS, which manifested as a teenager, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, which evolved in her sixth decade of life. This case emphasizes a key principle in neurology practice, which is to reconsider whether the original working diagnosis remains tenable, especially when confronted with evidence (clinical and/or paraclinical) that raises the possibility of a distinctively different disorder.

Pre-clinical studies have implicated vitamin D in the transcription of thousands of genes, but its influence may vary by cell type. A handful of clinical studies have failed to identify an in vivo gene expression signature when using bulk analysis of all peripheral immune cells. We hypothesized that vitamin D's gene signature would vary by immune cell type, requiring the analysis of distinct cell types. Multiple sclerosis patients (n = 18) were given high-dose vitamin D (10,400 IU/day) for six months as part of a prospective clinical trial (NCT01024777). We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from participants at baseline and again after six months of treatment. We used flow cytometry to isolate three immune cell types (CD4+ T-cells, CD19+ B-cells, CD14+ monocytes) for RNA microarray analysis and compared the expression profiles between baseline and six months. We identified distinct sets of differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways between baseline and six months for each cell type. Vitamin D's in vivo gene expression profile in the immune system likely differs by cell type. Future clinical studies should consider techniques that allow for a similar cell-type resolution.

The deoxyribonucleoside salvage deoxyribonucleotide metabolism. Previous studies have shown that deoxyribonucleoside salvage activity is enriched in lymphocytes and required for early lymphocyte development. However, specific roles for the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway and dCK in autoimmune diseases such as MS are unknown. Here we demonstrate that dCK activity is necessary for the development of clinical symptoms in the MOG35-55 and MOG1-125 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse models of MS. During EAE disease, deoxyribonucleoside salvage activity is elevated in the spleen and lymph nodes. Targeting dCK with the small molecule dCK inhibitor TRE-515 limits disease severity when treatments are started at disease induction or when symptoms first appear. EAE mice treated with TRE-515 have significantly fewer infiltrating leukocytes in the spinal cord, and TRE-515 blocks activation-induced B and T cell proliferation and MOG35-55 -specific T cell expansion without affecting innate immune cells or naive T and B cell populations. Our results demonstrate that targeting dCK limits symptoms in EAE mice and suggest that dCK activity is required for MOG35-55 -specific lymphocyte activation-induced proliferation. details for [DOI details for [PubMedID 35986643](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35986643) View details for [Web of Science ID 000815254003088](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000815254003088) View details for [Web of Science ID 000815254003081](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000815254003081) View details for [Web of Science ID 000815254003084](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000815254003084) Ozanimod, an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 and 5 modulator, is approved in multiple countries for treatment of relapsing forms of MS.To characterize long-term safety and efficacy of ozanimod.Patients with relapsing MS who completed a phase 13 ozanimod trial were eligible for an open-label extension study (DAYBREAK) of ozanimod 0.92mg/d. DAYBREAK began 16 October 2015; cutoff for this interim analysis was 2 February 2021.This analysis included 2494 participants with mean 46.8 (SD 11.9; range 0.03362.7) months of ozanimod exposure in DAYBREAK. During DAYBREAK, 2143 patients (85.9%) had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; similar in nature to those in the parent trials), 298 (11.9%) had a serious TEAE, and 75 (3.0%) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. infrequent. annualized relapse was 0.103 (95% confidence interval, 0.0860.123). Over 48months, 71% of patients relapse free. Adjusted mean numbers of new/enlarging T2 lesions/scan and gadolinium-enhancing lesions were low and similar across parent trial treatment subgroups.This long-term extension of ozanimod trials confirmed a favorable safety/tolerability profile and sustained benefit on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging measures of disease activity.

COVID-19 has highlighted health disparities both within and between countries and will leave a lasting impact on global society. Nonetheless, substantial investment in life sciences over recent decades has facilitated a rapid scientific response with innovations in viral characterization, testing, and sequencing. Perhaps most remarkably, this permitted the development of highly effective vaccines, which are being distributed globally at unprecedented speed. In contrast, drug treatments for the established disease have delivered limited benefits so far. Innovative and rapid approaches in the design and execution of large-scale clinical trials and repurposing of existing drugs have saved many lives; however, many more remain at risk. In this review we describe challenges and unmet needs, discuss existing therapeutics, and address future opportunities. Consideration is given to factors that have hindered drug development in order to support planning for the next pandemic challenge and to allow rapid and cost-effective development of new therapeutics with equitable delivery.

In these post hoc analyses, we investigated relationships between pNfL (at baseline and median percentage change from baseline to month 12 [SUNBEAM] or 24 [RADIANCE]) and clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes.RESULTS: Median (Q1, Q3) baseline pNfL, available in 1244/1346 was 14.70 (10.16, 23.26) pg/mL and in 1109/1313 RADIANCE participants was pg/mL. Baseline gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) and T2 lesion counts increased and brain volume decreased with increasing baseline pNfL. Baseline pNfL were higher in those with versus without on-treatment relapse. Median percentage reduction in pNfL at 12 months in SUNBEAM (n=1238) and 24 months in RADIANCE (n=1088) was greater ozanimod (20%-27%) than interferon beta-1a (13%-16%; P<0.01). Greater pNfL associated with fewer GdE lesions, fewer new/enlarging T2 lesions per scan, less loss of brain volume, lower annualized relapse rate (ARR), and no evidence of disease activity. The following models predicted ARR: 0.5111 + 0.0116 x DeltaNfL at 12 months (SUNBEAM) + 0.0088 x DeltaNfL at 24 months (RADIANCE).CONCLUSIONS: pNfL was associated with clinical and radiologic measures of disease and treatment effects in RMS, supporting its use as a biomarker.

In phase 3 trials, ozanimod was well tolerated and superior to interferon beta-1a 30 g once-weekly in reducing clinical and radiologic disease activity. The objective of this integrated safety analysis was to evaluate the safety of extended ozanimod exposure in participants with RMS from all clinical trials and compare it with phase 3 trial data.METHODS: We report pooled incidence and study durationadjusted incidence rates (IR) of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from an interim data cut (January 31, 2019) of RMS participants treated with ozanimod. Data were pooled from a phase 1 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trial, a placebo-controlled phase 2 trial with dose-blinded extension, 2 large active-controlled phase 3 trials, and an open-label extension (OLE). Results were compared with pooled phase 3 trial data.RESULTS: At the data cutoff, 2631 RMS participants had exposure to ozanimod 0.92 mg (mean 32.0 months) and 2787 had exposure to either ozanimod 0.46 or 0.92 mg (mean 37.1 months). The IRs per 1000 person-years (PY) for any TEAE (772.2) and serious TEAEs (33.2) in the overall population were similar to those in the phase 3 population (896.1 and 31.2, respectively). There were no serious opportunistic infections. There were no second-degree or higher atrioventricular blocks on electrocardiogram. Hepatic enzyme elevations declined over time. Malignancy rates remained low with longer exposure. Pulmonary function tests showed minimal reductions in lung function. Seven ozanimod-treated participants with comorbid risk factors had confirmed macular edema, including 3 in the ongoing OLE.CONCLUSIONS: Safety results in this larger RMS population with greater ozanimod exposure demonstrated no new safety concerns and were consistent with phase 3 trial results.

Immune cells naturally differ in their sensitivity to IL-2 due to cell type and activation state-dependent expression of receptors and signaling pathway components. To probe differences in IL-2 signaling across cell types, we used structure-based design to create and profile a series of IL-2 variants with the capacity to titrate maximum signal strength in fine increments. One of these partial agonists, IL-2-REH, specifically expanded Foxp3+ regulatory T cells with reduced activity on CD8+ T cells due to cell type-intrinsic differences in IL-2 signaling. IL-2-REH elicited cell type-dependent differences in gene expression and provided mixed therapeutic results: showing benefit in the in vivo mouse dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of colitis, but no therapeutic efficacy in a transfer colitis model. Our findings show that cytokine partial agonists can be used to calibrate intrinsic differences in response thresholds across responding cell types to narrow pleiotropic actions, which may be generalizable to other cytokine and growth factor systems.

These patients were then routinely assessed for the development of autoimmune disorders and safety signals related to the use of dual monoclonal antibody therapy.RESULTS: Five patients received at least 1 IV infusion of low-dose rituximab, following alemtuzumab therapy, with a mean follow-up of 41 months. None of the 5 patients developed secondary autoimmune disorders. An additional 5 patients with follow-up over less than 24 months received at least 1 infusion of low-dose rituximab treatment following alemtuzumab treatment. No secondary autoimmune diseases were observed.CONCLUSIONS: An anti-CD20 \"whack-a-mole\" B-cell depletion strategy may serve to mitigate alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmunity in MS by reducing the imbalance in B- and T-cell regulatory networks during immune reconstitution. We believe that these observations warrant further investigation.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for people with MS, low-dose rituximab following alemtuzumab treatment decreases the risk of alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmune diseases.

This respiratory tract infection is nefarious in how it targets the most distal and highly vulnerable aspect of the human bronchopulmonary tree, specifically, the delicate yet irreplaceable alveoli that are responsible for the loading of oxygen upon red cell hemoglobin for use by all of the body's tissues. In most symptomatic individuals, the disease is a mild immune-mediated syndrome, with limited damage to the lung tissues. About 20% of those affected experience a disease course characterized by a cataclysmic set of immune activation responses that can culminate in the diffuse and irreversible obliteration of the distal alveoli, leading to a virtual collapse of the gas-exchange apparatus. Here, in Part I of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we define severe COVID-19 as a consequence of the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to trigger what we now designate for the first time as a 'Prolific Activation of a Network-Immune-Inflammatory Crisis', or 'PANIC' Attack, in the alveolar tree. In Part II we describe an immunotherapeutic hypothesis worthy of the organization of a randomized clinical trial in order to ascertain whether a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent is capable of abolishing 'PANIC'; thereby preventing or mitigating severe COVID-19, with monumental ramifications for world health, and the global pandemic that continues to threaten it.

However, the chronic compartmentalized inflammation and neurodegeneration that define progressive MS are not prevented by these therapies and so significant damage to the brain and spinal cord and resulting disability ensues. Hence, the possibility of combining current immunotherapies with neuroprotective, remyelinating or regenerative therapies should be pursued.Areas This article sheds light on neuroprotective, remyelination and neurorepair strategies for MS, the numerous mechanisms for therapeutic targeting and the new candidates for combination therapies. We searched PubMed for articles with the terms, 'neuroprotection', remyelination' or 'regeneration' and 'therapies' or 'drugs' Opinion: An enriched understanding of the neurobiology and molecular changes that are activated by inflammatory CNS damage will provide new opportunities for the identification of neuroprotective, remyelinating and regenerative therapies. Success will depend on the improvement of CNS drug delivery, the identification of new predictive biomarkers, the optimization of clinical trials by assessment of the damage to the visual pathway and the testing of novel therapies in acute optic neuritis.

We propose as a putative randomized controlled trial that high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin (HDMTX-LR) rescue can abolish 'PANIC', thereby 'left-shifting' severe COVID-19 patients to the group majority of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are designated as having mild, even asymptomatic, disease. HDMTX-LR is endowed with broadly pleiotropic properties and is a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent which can be administered early in the course of severe COVID-19 thus rescuing the critical and irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli. Further, we describe a preventative treatment intervention regimen for those designated as having mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, but who exhibit features which herald the transition to the severe variant of this disease. Both of our proposed hypothesis-driven questions should be urgently subjected to rigorous assessment in the context of randomized controlled trials, in order to confirm or refute the contention that the approaches characterized herein, are in fact capable of exerting mitigating, if not abolishing, effects upon SARS-CoV-2 triggered 'PANIC Attack'. Confirmation of our immunotherapy hypothesis would have far-reaching ramifications for the current pandemic, along with yielding invaluable lessons which could be leveraged to more effectively prepare for the next challenge to global health.

Here we provide evidence that CD4+ T cells, a critical regulator of adaptive immunity, release extracellular threads of DNA on activation. These DNA extrusions convey autocrine costimulatory signals to T lymphocytes and can be detected in lymph nodes isolated during the priming phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4+ T cell-driven mouse model of multiple Pharmacologic mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) abolishes of DNA by CD4+ T cells, reducing cytokine production in vitro and T cell priming against myelin in vivo. Moreover, mtROS blockade during established EAE markedly ameliorates disease severity, dampening autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system. Taken together, these experimental results elucidate a mechanism of intrinsic immune costimulation mediated by DNA threads released by activated T helper cells, and identify a potential therapeutic target for such disorders as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and CD4+ T cell-mediated disorders.

By screening combinatorial chemical libraries using in vitro assays, we identified the small molecule BN201 that promotes the survival of cultured neural cells when subjected to oxidative stress or when deprived of trophic factors. Moreover, BN201 promotes neuronal differentiation, the differentiation of precursor cells to mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, and the myelination of new axons. BN201 modulates several kinases participating in the insulin growth factor 1 pathway including serum-glucocorticoid kinase and midkine, inducing the phosphorylation of NDRG1 and the translocation of the transcription factor Foxo3 to the cytoplasm. In vivo, BN201 prevents axonal and neuronal loss, and it promotes remyelination in models of multiple sclerosis, chemically induced demyelination, and glaucoma. In summary, we provide a new promising strategy to promote neuroaxonal survival and remyelination, potentially preventing disability in brain diseases.

In the RADIANCE phase 2 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was associated with better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures and was well tolerated. The RADIANCE phase 3 study aimed to confirm the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus interferon beta-1a in individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.We did a 24-month, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy phase 3 trial in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis at 147 medical centres and clinical practices in 21 countries. Participants were aged 18-55 years, had multiple sclerosis according to 2010 McDonald criteria, a relapsing clinical course, brain MRI lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis, an expanded disability status scale score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months before screening plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within the 12 months before randomisation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via an interactive voice response system to daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) over 24 months. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population of all participants who received study drug and safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received study drug, grouped by highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02047734, and EudraCT, 2012-002714-40.Between Dec 27, 2013, and March 31, 2015, we screened 1695 participants, of which 375 did not meet inclusion criteria. 1320 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to a group, of whom 1313 received study drug (433 assigned to ozanimod 10 mg, 439 assigned to ozanimod 05 mg, and 441 assigned to interferon beta-1a) and 1138 (867%) completed 24 months of treatment. Adjusted ARRs were (95% CI 05 mg, and 028 (023-032) with interferon beta-1a, with rate ratios versus interferon beta-1a of 062 (95% CI 051-077; p<00001) for ozanimod to p=00167) for ozanimod 05 mg. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was higher in the interferon beta-1a group (365 [830%] of 440 participants) than in the ozanimod 10 mg group (324 [747%] of 434) or the ozanimod 05 mg group (326 [743%] of 439). More participants in the interferon beta-1a group had treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation than in the ozanimod groups. Incidences of infections and serious treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across treatment groups. No cases of ozanimod-related symptomatic reduction in heart rate and no second-degree or third-degree cases of atrioventricular block were reported.In this 24-month phase 3 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was well tolerated and associated with a significantly lower rate of clinical relapses than intramuscular interferon beta-1a. These findings show the potential of ozanimod as an effective oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

The RADIANCE phase 2 study showed that ozanimod had better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures, with a favourable safety profile, in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The SUNBEAM study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus intramuscular interferon beta-1a in participants was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled phase 3 trial done at 152 academic medical centres and clinical practices in 20 countries. We enrolled participants aged 18-55 years with relapsing multiple sclerosis, baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within the 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within 12 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 by a blocked algorithm stratified by country and baseline EDSS score to at least 12 months treatment of either once-daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) during the treatment period and was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants according to the highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02294058 and EudraCT, number 2014-002320-27.Between Dec 18, 2014, and Nov 12, 2015, 1346 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to ozanimod 10 mg (n=447), ozanimod 05 mg (n=451), or interferon beta-1a (n=448). 91 (68%) participants discontinued the study drug (29 in the ozanimod 10 mg group; 26 in the ozanimod 05 mg group; and 36 in the interferon beta-1a group). Adjusted ARRs were 035 (028-044) for interferon beta-1a, 018 (95% CI 014-024) for ozanimod 10 mg [RR] 052 beta-1a; p<00001), [055-086] vs interferon beta-1a; p=00013). Few ozanimod-treated participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events (13 [29%] who received ozanimod 10 mg; seven [15%] who received 05 16 who interferon clinically significant bradycardia or second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block was reported. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar across treatment groups (13 [29%] participants who received ozanimod 10 mg; 16 [35%] who received ozanimod 05 mg; and 11 [25%] who received interferon beta-1a). No serious opportunistic infections occurred in ozanimod-treated participants.In participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis treated for at least 12 months, ozanimod was well tolerated and demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate than interferon beta-1a. These findings provide support for ozanimod as an oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

The data were directly compared with those in aquaporin-4 antibody-positive (AQP4-IgG+) neuromyelitis optica and non-inflammatory controls (n=14).In MOG-IgG+ disease, there was no female preponderance and the ages were younger (mean 18 years, range 3-68; 15 were below 18 years) relative to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD (41, 15-77) and MS (34, 17-48). CSF cell counts were higher and oligoclonal IgG bands were mostly negative in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD compared with MS. MOG-IgG+ disease had significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor protein-1 and macrophage protein-1 as compared with MS. No cytokine in MOG-IgG+ disease was significantly different from AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD. Moreover many elevated cytokines were correlated with each other in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut not in MS. No difference in the data was seen between adult and paediatric MOG-IgG+ cases.The CSF cytokine profile in the acute phase of MOG-IgG+ disease is characterised by coordinated upregulation of T helper 17 (Th17) and other cytokines including some Th1-related and regulatory T cells-related ones in adults and children, which is similar to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut clearly different from MS. The results suggest that as with AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD, some disease-modifying drugs for MS may be ineffective in MOG-IgG+ disease while they may provide potential therapeutic targets.

Here we show that patients with metastatic but non-progressing melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma exhibited increased levels of blood plasmablasts. We used a cell-barcoding technology to sequence their plasmablast antibody repertoires, revealing clonal families of affinity matured B cells that exhibit progressive class switching and persistence over time. Anti-CTLA4 and other treatments were associated with further increases in somatic hypermutation and clonal family size. Recombinant antibodies from clonal families bound non-autologous tumor tissue and cell lines, and families possessing immunoglobulin paratope sequence motifs shared across patients exhibited increased rates of binding. We identified antibodies that caused regression of, and durable immunity toward, heterologous syngeneic tumors in mice. Our findings demonstrate convergent functional anti-tumor antibody responses targeting public tumor antigens, and provide an approach to identify antibodies with diagnostic or therapeutic utility.

After 24weeks, participants could enter a 2-year, dose-blinded extension. Ozanimod-treated participants continued their assigned dose; placebo participants were re-randomized (1:1) to ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5 or 1mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.46 and 0.92mg).A total of 223 (89.6%) of the 249 participants completed the blinded extension. At 2years of the extension, the percentage of participants who were gadolinium-enhancing lesion-free ranged from 86.5% to 94.6%. Unadjusted annualized relapse rate during the blinded extension (week 24-end of treatment) was 0.32 for ozanimod hydrochloride ozanimod 0.5 and 0.18 for placebo ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg. No second-degree or higher atrioventricular block or serious opportunistic infection was reported.Ozanimod demonstrated sustained efficacy in participants continuing treatment up to 2years and reached similar efficacy in participants who switched from placebo; no unexpected safety signals emerged.

We tested the immune modulating effects of fluoxetine in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that fluoxetine delayed the onset of disease and reduced clinical paralysis in mice with established disease. Fluoxetine had abrogating effects on proliferation of immune cells and inflammatory cytokine production by both antigen-presenting cells and T cells. Specifically, in CD4 T cells, fluoxetine increased Fas-induced apoptosis. We conclude that fluoxetine possesses immune-modulating effects resulting in the amelioration of symptoms in EAE.

Normally, demyelination is followed by remyelination, which requires repopulation of a demyelinated area by oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Although large numbers of precursor cells are present in MS lesions, remyelination often fails, in part by the inability of precursor cells to differentiate into mature myelin-forming cells. In mouse and rat, miR-219 is required for this differentiation. Previously, we identified decreased miR-219 expression in tissue of MS patients compared to controls. Cell-free miRNAs have been detected in many different body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may reflect disease processes going on in the central nervous system. This prompted us to investigate the biomarker performance of CSF miR-219 for MS diagnosis.Quantitative PCR was performed measuring miR-219 levels in CSF of MS patients and controls in three independent cohorts.All three cohorts of MS patients and controls revealed that absence of miR-219 detection in CSF is consistently associated with MS.We have been able to identify and validate absence of miR-219 detection in CSF of MS patients compared to controls, suggesting that it may emerge as a candidate biomarker for MS diagnosis.

Activated microglia are considered a major source of nitric oxide and subsequent peroxynitrite-mediated damage of myelin. Here, we provide biochemical and biophysical evidence that the oxidoreductase glutaredoxin 2 inhibits peroxynitrite formation by transforming nitric oxide into dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron-complexes. Glutaredoxin 2 levels influence both survival rates of primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and preservation of myelin structure in cerebellar organotypic slice cultures challenged with activated microglia or nitric oxide donors. Of note, glutaredoxin 2-mediated protection is not linked to its enzymatic activity as oxidoreductase, but to the disassembly of its uniquely coordinated iron-sulfur cluster using glutathione as non-protein ligand. The protective effect of glutaredoxin 2 is connected to decreased protein carbonylation and nitration. In line, brain lesions of mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, show decreased glutaredoxin 2 expression and increased nitrotyrosine formation indicating that this type of protection is missing in the inflamed central nervous system. Our findings link inorganic biochemistry to neuroinflammation and identify glutaredoxin 2 as a protective factor against neuroinflammation-mediated myelin damage. Thus, improved availability of glutathione-coordinated iron-sulfur clusters emerges as a potential therapeutic approach in inflammatory demyelination.

Immunization of wild-type (WT) mice with AQP4 peptides elicited T cell proliferation, although those T cells could not transfer disease to nave recipient mice. Recently, two novel AQP4 T cell epitopes, peptide (p) 135-153 and p201-220, were identified when studying immune responses to AQP4 in AQP4-deficient (AQP4-/-) mice, suggesting T cell reactivity to these epitopes is normally controlled by thymic negative selection. AQP4-/- Th17 polarized T cells primed to either p135-153 or p201-220 induced paralysis in recipient WT mice, that was associated with predominantly leptomeningeal inflammation of the spinal cord and optic nerves. Inflammation surrounding optic nerves and involvement of the inner retinal layers (IRL) were manifested by changes in serial optical coherence tomography (OCT). Here, we illustrate the approaches used to create this new in vivo model of AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA), which can now be employed to study mechanisms that permit development of pathogenic AQP4-specific T cells and how they may cooperate with B cells in NMO pathogenesis.

In BALB/c mice, EAE was induced by immunization with myelin proteolipid protein 185-206.RESULTS: Treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody resulted in exacerbation of EAE and increased CNS inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. Treated mice displayed long-lasting complete depletion of basophils in the blood stream and peripheral lymphoid organs and increased antigen-induced immune cell proliferation and production of interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In BALB/c mice, which are T-helper (Th) 2 prone and resistant to EAE, treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody restored susceptibility to EAE.CONCLUSION: Our observations that anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody increases Th1 and Th17 responses against myelin antigen and exacerbates EAE suggest that FcepsilonRI, basophils, and possibly other FcepsilonRI-bearing cells that might be affected by this antibody play important roles in influencing the severity of CNS autoimmunity.

We reexamined this using highly purified PH20.Steady-state expression of mRNA in OPCs was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction; the role of PH20 in bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH) inhibition of OPC differentiation was explored by comparing BTH to a purified recombinant human PH20 (rHuPH20). Contaminants in commercial BTH were identified and their impact on OPC differentiation characterized. Spam1/PH20 expression in normal and demyelinated mouse CNS tissue was investigated using deep RNA sequencing and immunohistological methods with two antibodies directed against recombinant murine PH20.BTH, but not rHuPH20, inhibited OPC differentiation in vitro. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was identified as a significant contaminant in BTH, and bFGF immunodepletion reversed OPC differentiation. Spam1 mRNA was in OPCs in vitro and in vivo; PH20 immunolabeling was undetected in normal and demyelinated CNS.We were unable to detect Spam1/PH20 expression in OPCs or in normal or demyelinated CNS using the most sensitive methods currently available. Further, \"BTH\" effects on OPC differentiation are not due to PH20, but may be attributable to contaminating bFGF. Our data suggest that caution be exercised when using some commercially available hyaluronidases, and reports of Spam1/PH20 morphogenic activity in the CNS may be due to contaminants in reagents.

When bifurcated by sex or EBNA1 blood titer levels, males and high-titer subpopulations show even stronger positive time correlation, while females and low-titer populations show negative time correlation in early childhood (long IM/MS delay). The correlation becomes positive in females beyond puberty.IM/MS time correlation implies causality if IM is time random. Alternative confounding models seem implausible, in light of constraints imposed by time-invariant delay observed here. Childhood infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in females and/or those genetically prone to low EBNA1 blood titers will develop MS slowly. Males and/or high EBNA1-prone develop MS more rapidly following IM infection at all ages. For all, postpubescent EBV infection is critical for the initiation and rapid development of MS.

Earlier studies have indicated that CRYAB inhibits inflammation and attenuates clinical disease when administered in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. In this study, we evaluated the role of CRYAB in primary demyelinating events. Using the cuprizone model of demyelination, a noninflammatory model that allows the analysis of glial responses in MS, we show that endogenous CRYAB expression is associated with increased severity of demyelination. Moreover, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the expression of CRYAB and the extent of reactive astrogliosis in demyelinating areas and in in vitro assays. In addition, we reveal that CRYAB is differentially phosphorylated in astrocytes in active demyelinating MS lesions, as well as in cuprizone-induced lesions, and that this phosphorylation is required for the reactive astrocyte response associated with demyelination. Furthermore, taking a proteomics approach to identify proteins that are bound by the phosphorylated forms of CRYAB in primary cultured astrocytes, we show that there is clear differential binding of protein targets due to the specific phosphorylation of CRYAB. Subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of these targets reveals implications for intracellular pathways and biological processes that could be affected by these modifications. Together, these findings demonstrate that astrocytes play a pivotal role in demyelination, making them a potential target for therapeutic intervention, and that phosphorylation of CRYAB is a key factor supporting the pathogenic response of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte injury.

Twenty-three patients were randomized to ACTH (n = 12) or IVMP (n = 11) and completed the study. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative number of relapses. Secondary outcomes included EDSS, Mental Health Inventory (MHI), plasma cytokines, MS Functional Composite (MSFC), Quality-of-Life (MS-QOL) score, bone mineral density (BMD), and new or worsened psychiatric symptoms per month. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed post hoc. This was a preliminary and small-scale study.Relapse rates differed significantly [ACTH 0.03) MHI (slope 0.95 0.38 points/month; p = 0.02 versus slope -0.38 0.43 points/month; p = 0.39). On-study decreases (all p < 0.05) in eight cytokine levels occurred only in the ACTH group. However, on-study EDSS, MSFC, MS-QOL, BMD, and MRI lesion changes were not significant between groups. Psychiatric symptoms per patient were greater with IVMP than ACTH (0.55, 95% CI 0.12-2.6 versus 0; p < 0.0001). Other common adverse events were insomnia and urinary tract infections (IVMP, seven events each) and fatigue or flu symptoms (ACTH, five events each).This study provided class II evidence that ACTH produced better examiner-assessed cumulative rates of relapses per patient than IVMP in the adjunctive treatment of breakthrough disease in multiple sclerosis.

However, their pathogenic role in CNS autoimmune inflammatory disease is unclear. Although multiple AQP4 T-cell epitopes have been identified in WT C57BL/6 mice, we observed that neither immunization with those determinants nor transfer of donor T cells targeting them caused CNS autoimmune disease in recipient mice. In contrast, robust proliferation was observed following immunization of AQP4-deficient (AQP4(-/-)) mice with AQP4 peptide (p) predicted to contain I-A(b)-restricted T-cell epitopes but not identified in WT mice. In comparison with WT mice, AQP4(-/-) mice used unique T-cell receptor repertoires for recognition of these two AQP4 epitopes. Donor T cells specific for either determinant from AQP4(-/-), but not WT, mice induced paralysis in recipient WT and B-cell-deficient mice. AQP4-specific Th17-polarized cells induced more severe disease than Th1-polarized cells. Clinical signs were associated with opticospinal infiltrates of T cells and monocytes. Fluorescent-labeled donor T cells were detected in CNS lesions. Visual system involvement was evident by changes in optical coherence tomography. Fine mapping of AQP4 p201-220 and p135-153 epitopes identified peptides within p201-220 but not p135-153, which induced clinical disease in 40% of WT mice by direct immunization. Our results provide a foundation to evaluate how AQP4-specific T cells contribute to AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA) and suggest that pathogenic AQP4-specific T-cell responses are normally restrained by central tolerance, which may be relevant to understanding development of AQP4-reactive T cells in NMO.

We found that strong activation of innate immunity induced Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-independent and interferon- (IFN)-resistant EAE (termed type B EAE), whereas EAE induced by weak activation of innate immunity requires the NLRP3 inflammasome and is sensitive to IFN treatment. Instead, an alternative inflammatory mechanism, including membrane-bound lymphotoxin- receptor (LTR) and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), is involved in type B EAE development, and type B EAE is ameliorated by antagonizing these receptors. Relative expression of Ltbr and Cxcr2 genes was indeed enhanced in patients with IFN-resistant multiple sclerosis. Remission was minimal in type B EAE due to neuronal damages induced by semaphorin 6B upregulation on CD4(+) T cells.

The characteristic phenotype is disruption of astrocyte function and demyelination of spinal cord, optic nerves, and particular brain regions. In this second of a 2-part article, we present further perspectives regarding the pathogenesis of NMO/SD and how this disease might be amenable to emerging technologies aimed at restoring immune tolerance to disease-implicated self-antigens. NMO/SD appears to be particularly well-suited for these strategies since aquaporin-4 has already been identified as the dominant autoantigen. The recent technical advances in reintroducing immune tolerance in experimental models of disease as well as in humans should encourage quantum leaps in this area that may prove productive for novel therapy. In this part of the article series, the potential for regulatory T and B cells is brought into focus, as are new approaches to oral tolerization. Finally, a roadmap is provided to help identify potential issues in clinical development and guide applications in tolerization therapy to solving NMO/SD through the use of emerging technologies. Each of these perspectives is intended to shine new light on potential cures for NMO/SD and other autoimmune diseases, while sparing normal host defense mechanisms.

This process results in a characteristic pattern of astrocyte dysfunction, loss, and demyelination that predominantly affects the spinal cord and optic nerves. Although several empirical therapies are currently used in the treatment of NMO/SD, none has been proven effective in prospective, adequately powered, randomized trials. Furthermore, most of the current therapies subject patients to long-term immunologic suppression that can cause serious infections and development of cancers. The following is the first of a 2-part description of several key immune mechanisms in NMO/SD that might be amenable to therapeutic restoration of immune tolerance. It is intended to provide a roadmap for how potential immune tolerance restorative techniques might be applied to patients with NMO/SD. This initial installment provides a background rationale underlying attempts at immune tolerization. It provides specific examples of innovative approaches that have emerged recently as a consequence of technical advances. In several autoimmune diseases, these strategies have been reduced to practice. Therefore, in theory, the identification of aquaporin-4 as the dominant autoantigen makes NMO/SD an ideal candidate for the development of tolerizing therapies or cures for this increasingly recognized disease.

Efficacy however differs between two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and C57BL/10SnJ (B10). Amyloid hexapeptide treatments improved the clinical outcomes of B6, but not B10 mice, indicating that genetic background influences therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, although previous studies indicated that prion protein deficiency results in more severe EAE in B6 mice, we observed no such effect in B10 mice. In addition, we found that amyloid hexapeptide treatments of B10 and B6 mice elicited differential IL4 responses. Thus, the modulatory potential of prion protein and related treatments with other amyloid hexapeptides in EAE depends on mouse strain.

In order to facilitate future studies in this area, we have examined the dosing, treatment route, treatment duration, and metabolism of 4-MU in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Mice fed chow containing 5% 4-MU, a dose calculated to deliver 250 mg/mouse/day, initially lose substantial weight but typically resume normal weight gain after one week. It also takes up to a week to see a reduction in serum HA in these animals, indicating that at least a one-week loading period on the drug is required for most protocols. At steady state, over 90% of the drug is present in plasma as the metabolite comprising most of the remainder. Chow containing 5% but not 0.65% 4-MU was effective at preventing disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis as well as in the DORmO mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. While oral 4-MU was effective at preventing EAE, daily intraperitoneal injections of 4-MU were not. Factors potentially affecting 4-MU uptake and plasma concentrations in mice include its taste, short half-life and low bioavailability. These studies provide a practical resource for implementing oral 4-MU treatment protocols in mice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Here we demonstrate a key role of carcinoembryogenic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule1 (CEACAM1) in B cell aggregate formation in MS patients and a B cell-dependent mouse model of MS. CEACAM1 expression was increased on peripheral blood B cells and CEACAM1(+) B cells were present in brain infiltrates of MS patients. Administration of the anti-CEACAM1 antibody T84.1 was efficient in blocking aggregation of B cells derived from MS patients. Along these lines, application of the monoclonal anti-CEACAM1 antibody mCC1 was able to inhibit CNS B cell aggregate formation and significantly attenuated established MS-like disease in mice in the absence of any adverse effects. CEACAM1 was co-expressed with the regulator molecule T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain -3 (TIM-3) on B cells, a novel molecule that has recently been described to induce anergy in T cells. Interestingly, elevated coexpression on B cells coincided with an autoreactive T helper cell phenotype in MS patients. Overall, these data identify CEACAM1 as a clinically highly interesting target in MS pathogenesis and open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the disease.

Multiple proteins with overlapping functions play a role in IFN signaling, but the signaling events downstream of receptor engagement are unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the roles of the type I and type II IFN signaling components IFN-// receptor 2 (IFNAR-2), IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9), and STAT-1 in a mouse model of SLE.We used immunohistochemical staining and highly multiplexed histology, autoantibody production, cytokine/chemokine profiles, and STAT phosphorylation in order to investigate the individual roles of IFNAR-2, IRF-9, and STAT-1 in MRL/lpr mice.We found that not IRF-9(-/-) or IFNAR-2(-/-) mice, developed interstitial nephritis characterized by infiltration retinoic receptor-related orphan receptor t-positive lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils.

Number of relapses and changes in disability were assessed 2 years prior to and 2 years after initiation of treatment. Sera were collected at baseline and after 3 months on therapy. Cytokine levels in sera were assessed by Luminex multiplex assays. Baseline cytokine profiles were grouped by hierarchical clustering analysis. Demographic features, changes in cytokines, and clinical outcome were then assessed in the clustered patient groups.A total of 157 patients were included in the study and clustered into 6 distinct subsets by baseline cytokine profiles. These subsets differed significantly in their clinical and biological response to IFN- therapy. Two subsets were associated with patients who responded poorly to therapy. Two other subsets, associated with a good response to therapy, showed a significant reduction in relapse rates and no worsening of disability. Each subset also had differential changes in cytokine levels after 3 months of IFN- treatment.There is heterogeneity in the immunologic pathways of the RRMS population, which correlates with IFN- response.

Although canine diabetes shares many features with human type-1 diabetes, there are differences that have cast doubt on the immunologic origin of the canine disease. In this study, we examined whether peripheral immune responses directed against islet antigens were present in dogs with diabetes. Routine diagnostics were used to confirm diabetic status, and serum samples from dogs with (N = 15) and without (N = 15) diabetes were analyzed for the presence of antibodies against islet antigens (insulin, using standard radioassays. Interferon- production from peripheral blood T cells stimulated by porcine insulin and by human insulin was tested using Elispot assays. Anti-insulin antibodies were detectable in a subset of diabetic dogs receiving insulin therapy. Pre-activated T cells and incipient insulin-reactive T cells in response to porcine or human insulin were identified in non-diabetic dogs and in dogs with diabetes. The data show that humoral and cellular anti-insulin immune responses are detectable in dogs with diabetes.

This fear has been amplified more recently by multiple epidemiologic studies that confirmed the link of an AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine (Pandemrix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Germany) used in Europe during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [A(H1N1) pdm09] with the development of narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder, in children and adolescents. However, public misperceptions of what adjuvants are and why they are used in vaccines has created in some individuals a closed \"black box\" attitude towards all vaccines. The focus of this review article is to revisit this \"black box\" using the example of narcolepsy associated with the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine.

Conventionally, only antibodies targeting these molecules have been thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. This notion has been challenged by a growing pool of evidence that suggests that antibodies toward additional targets may play a role in disease. The aims of this study were to (i) establish high-throughput protein microarray technology as a method to investigate traditional and putative autoantibodies (autoAbs) in PV and (ii) use multiplexed protein array technology to define the scope and specificity of the autoAb response in PV. Our analysis demonstrated significant IgG reactivity in patients with PV toward the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes 3, 4, and 5 as well as thyroid peroxidase. Furthermore, we found that healthy first- and second-degree relatives of patients with PV express autoAbs toward desmoglein and non-Dsg targets. Our analysis also identified genetic elements, particularly HLA, as key drivers of autoAb expression. Finally, we show that patients with PV exhibit significantly reduced IgM reactivity toward disease-associated antigens relative to controls. The use of protein microarrays to profile the autoAb response in PV advanced the current understanding of disease and provided insight into the complex relationship between genetics and disease development.

We have evaluated the impact of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an oral inhibitor of HA synthesis, on disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Treatment with 4-MU decreases the incidence of EAE, delays its onset, and reduces the severity of established disease. 4-MU inhibits the activation of autoreactive T cells and prevents their polarization toward a Th1 phenotype. Instead, 4-MU promotes polarization toward a Th2 phenotpye and induction of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Further, 4-MU hastens trafficking of T cells through secondary lymphoid organs, impairs the infiltration of T cells into the CNS parenchyma, and limits astrogliosis. Together, these data suggest that HA synthesis is necessary for disease progression in EAE and that treatment with 4-MU may be a potential therapeutic strategy in CNS autoimmunity. Considering that 4-MU is already a therapeutic, called hymecromone, that is approved to treat biliary spasm in humans, we propose that it could be repurposed to treat MS.

Assessments were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months.Mean increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from baseline to final visit was larger in the high-dose group (34.9 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval (6.9 ng/mL; 95% CI 1.0-13.7 ng/mL). Adverse events were minor and did not differ between the 2 groups. Two relapses occurred, one in each treatment arm. In the high-dose group, we found a reduction in the proportion of interleukin-17(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.016), CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.03), and effector memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.021) with a concomitant increase in the proportion of central memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.018) and naive CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.04). These effects were not observed in the low-dose group.Cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and tolerable in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS, which include reduction of interleukin-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and decreased proportion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells with concomitant increase in central memory CD4(+) T cells and naive CD4(+) T cells.This study provides Class I evidence that cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and well-tolerated in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects.

T cells reactive with epitopes derived from insulin and/or IGRP are critical for the initiation and maintenance of disease, but T cells reactive with other islet antigens likely have an essential role in disease progression. We sought to identify candidate CD8(+) T cell epitopes that are pathogenic in type 1 diabetes. Proteins that elicit autoantibodies in human type 1 diabetes were analyzed by predictive algorithms for candidate epitopes. Using several different tolerizing regimes using synthetic peptides, two new predicted tolerogenic CD8(+) T cell epitopes were identified in the murine homolog of the major human islet autoantigen zinc transporter ZnT8 (aa 158-166 and 282-290) and one in a non- cell protein, dopamine -hydroxylase (aa 233-241). Tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with a cDNA plasmid expressing full-length proinsulin prevented diabetes, whereas plasmids encoding ZnT8 and DH did not. However, tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with the proinsulin plasmid in combination with plasmids expressing ZnT8 and DH decreased insulitis and enhanced prevention of disease compared to vaccination with the plasmid encoding proinsulin alone.

These antibodies cross-reacted with a particular fragment of influenza nucleoprotein (NP) - one of the proteins naturally contained in the virus used to make seasonal influenza vaccine and pandemic influenza vaccines. The purpose of this commentary is to provide additional insights and interpretations of the findings and share additional data not presented in the original paper to help the reader appreciate the key messages of that publication. First, a brief background to narcolepsy and vaccine-induced narcolepsy will be provided. Then, additional insights and clarification will be provided on the following topics: 1) the critical difference identified in the adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines, 2) the contributing factor likely for the discordant association of narcolepsy between the AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccines Pandemrix and Arepanrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, s.a.), 3) the significance of detecting HCRT receptor 2 (HCRTr2) antibodies in some Finnish control subjects, 4) the approach used for the detection of HCRTr2 antibodies in vaccine-associated narcolepsy, and 5) the plausibility of the proposed mechanism involving HCRTr2 modulation in vaccine-associated narcolepsy.

A critical pathological aspect of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the influx of immunomodulatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS). Identification of key players that regulate cellular trafficking into the CNS may lead to the development of more selective treatment to halt this process. The multifunctional enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) can participate in various inflammation-related processes, and is known to be expressed in the CNS. In the present study, we question whether TG2 activity contributes to the pathogenesis of experimental MS, and could be a novel therapeutic target. In human post-mortem material, we showed the appearance of TG2 immunoreactivity in leukocytes in MS lesions, and particular in macrophages in rat chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (cr-EAE), an experimental MS model. Clinical deficits as observed in mouse EAE were reduced in TG2 knock-out mice compared to littermate wild-type mice, supporting a role of TG2 in EAE pathogenesis. To establish if the enzyme TG2 represents an attractive therapeutic target, cr-EAE rats were treated with TG2 activity inhibitors during ongoing disease. Reduction of TG2 activity in cr-EAE animals dramatically attenuated clinical deficits and demyelination. The mechanism underlying these beneficial effects pointed toward a reduction in macrophage migration into the CNS due to attenuated cytoskeletal flexibility and RhoA GTPase activity. Moreover, iNOS and TNF levels were selectively reduced in the CNS of cr-EAE rats treated with a TG2 activity inhibitor, whereas other relevant inflammatory mediators were not affected in CNS or spleen by reducing TG2 activity. We conclude that modulating TG2 activity opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in MS which does not affect peripheral levels of inflammatory mediators.

In principle, antigen-specific therapy would eradicate unwanted adaptive immune responses-antibody and T-cell mediated--while preserving the integrity of other adaptive responses to infectious agents and retaining the ability to fight malignancy. However, at this time, for multiple sclerosis (MS) we do not have compelling evidence that would support any particular dominant immune response to any specific antigen or even a limited group of antigens. In fact, there are adaptive immune responses to a wide swathe of proteins and lipids found on neurons and myelin in MS. Unless controlling a few of the known immune responses is sufficient, antigen-specific therapy in MS may not have enough of an impact to modulate clinical outcome.

In this study, we show that genetic ablation of a natural tuner of TCR signaling, mir-181a-1/b-1, in double-positive thymocytes dampened TCR and Erk signaling and increased the threshold of positive selection. Whereas mir-181a-1/b-1 deletion in mice resulted in an increase in the intrinsic reactivity of naive T cells to self-antigens, it did not cause spontaneous autoimmunity. Loss of mir-181a-1/b-1 dampened the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and reduced basal TCR signaling in peripheral T cells and their migration from lymph nodes to pathogenic sites. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tolerance can be modulated by microRNA gene products through the control of opposing activities in T cell selection and peripheral T cell function.

For example, circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a key regulator of lymphocyte egress. Although the majority of plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle, the immunological functions of the ApoM-S1P complex are unknown. Here we show that ApoM-S1P is dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking yet restrains lymphopoiesis by activating the S1P1 receptor on bone marrow lymphocyte progenitors. Mice that lacked ApoM (Apom(-/-)) had bone marrow. Pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression of S1P1 suppressed LSK and CLP cell proliferation in vivo. ApoM was stably associated with bone marrow CLPs, which showed active S1P1 signalling in vivo. Moreover, ApoM-bound S1P, but not albumin-bound S1P, inhibited lymphopoiesis in vitro. Upon immune stimulation, Apom(-/-) mice developed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, characterized by increased lymphocytes in the central nervous system and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the ApoM-S1P-S1P1 signalling axis restrains the lymphocyte compartment and, subsequently, adaptive immune responses. Unique biological functions imparted by specific S1P chaperones could be exploited for novel therapeutic opportunities.

We evaluated the biological effects of PK2 on expression of EAE and on development of T-cell response against myelin by blocking PK2 in vivo with PK2 receptor antagonists. We treated with PK2 immune cells activated against myelin antigen to explore the immune-modulating effects of this peptide in vitro.Pk2 messenger RNA was upregulated in spinal cord and lymph node cells (LNCs) of mice with EAE. PK2 protein was expressed in EAE inflammatory infiltrates and was increased in sera during EAE. In patients with relapsing-remitting MS, transcripts for PK2 were significantly increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with healthy controls, and PK2 serum concentrations were significantly higher. A PK2 receptor antagonist prevented or attenuated established EAE in chronic and relapsing-remitting models, reduced CNS inflammation and demyelination, and decreased the production of interferon (IFN)- and interleukin (IL)-17A cytokines in LNCs while increasing IL-10. in IFN- and and reduced IL-10 in splenocytes activated against myelin antigen.These data suggest that PK2 is a critical immune regulator in CNS autoimmune demyelination and may represent a new target for therapy.

The study was undertaken to assess whether CD4 cell counts correlate with different phases of natalizumab treatment of relapsing MS patients, including during a 12-week planned treatment interruption, and whether that might provide insights on lymphocyte trafficking. Clinical outcomes, MRI data, and CD4 cell counts were assessed at baseline prior to initiating natalizumab, while on regular dosing, at the end of the 12-week extended dosing interval, and at the time of reinitiation of natalizumab. The 12-week interruption was well tolerated and not associated with return of MS activity, disability progression, or new or worsened MRI data. Observed significant shifts in CD4 counts - dramatically increasing from the baseline while on treatment and decreasing back to the baseline level off treatment, then rising in a similar manner on natalizumab reinitiation, suggest that these measurements may aid in monitoring modulation of lymphocyte trafficking and cell redistribution.

Despite widespread use of IFN-, the therapeutic mechanism is still partially understood. Particularly, the clinical relevance of increased B cell activity during IFN- treatment is unclear. In this article, we show that IFN- pushes some B cells into a transitional, regulatory population that is a critical mechanism for therapy. IFN- treatment increases the absolute number of regulatory CD19(+)CD24(++)CD38(++) transitional B cells in peripheral blood relative to treatment-naive and Copaxone-treated patients. In addition, we found that transitional B cells from both healthy controls and IFN--treated MS patients are potent producers of IL-10, and that the capability of IFN- to induce IL-10 is amplified when B cells are stimulated. Similar changes are seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IFN- treatment increases transitional and regulatory B cell populations, as well as IL-10 secretion in the spleen. Furthermore, we found that IFN- increases autoantibody production, implicating humoral immune activation in B cell regulatory responses. Finally, we demonstrate that IFN- therapy requires immune-regulatory B cells by showing that B cell-deficient mice do not benefit clinically or histopathologically from IFN- treatment. These results have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.

However, recent findings have challenged this common view, showing that PRL does not play a crucial role in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS), and even protects against adjuvant-induced model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this review we provide a critical overview of data supporting a role for PRL in the regulation of immune responses. In addition, we focus on studies exploring the involvement of PRL in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, MS and RA, in light of the recently-outlined regenerative properties of this hormone.

Importantly, stroke survivors have more than twice the risk of subsequently developing dementia compared with people who have never had a stroke. The link between stroke and the later development of dementia is not understood. There are reports of oligoclonal bands in the CSF of stroke patients, suggesting that in some people a B-lymphocyte response to stroke may occur in the CNS. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke could contribute to the onset of dementia. We discovered that, in mouse models, activated B-lymphocytes infiltrate infarcted tissue in the weeks after stroke. B-lymphocytes undergo isotype switching, and IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies are found in the neuropil adjacent to the lesion. Concurrently, mice develop delayed deficits in LTP and cognition. Genetic deficiency, and the pharmacologic ablation of B-lymphocytes using an anti-CD20 antibody, prevents the appearance of delayed cognitive deficits. Furthermore, immunostaining of human postmortem tissue revealed that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke also occurs in the brain of some people with stroke and dementia. These data suggest that some stroke patients may develop a B-lymphocyte response to stroke that contributes to dementia, and is potentially treatable with FDA-approved drugs that target B cells.

While the ebb and flow of inflammation can be followed in many tissues, there is not a great deal of information on how inflammation regresses in the brain. In this issue of the JCI, Walsh, Hendrix, and colleagues illuminate a cellular mechanism whereby T cells that infiltrate the brain after nerve crush or contusion actually protect neurons from injury. These infiltrating T cells produce IL-4 and do so independently of a classic adaptive T cell immune response. The T cells respond to mediators produced by damaged neurons, without the classic three-way interaction among antigen, the major histocompatibility complex, and the T cell receptor. After brain injury, these protective T cells produce IL-4, which attenuates damage via IL-4 receptors on neurons.

However, amyloid fibrils composed of six amino acids are protective in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decrease in the number of inflammatory foci in the parenchyma and meninges of the brain and spinal cord, and amelioration of the neurological signs of EAE when amyloid fibril-forming hexapeptides are administered reveal that some fibrils provide benefit. The therapeutic activity of the amyloid fibrils arise from diverse pathways that include binding of pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma, reduction of IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- levels, and induction of type 1 interferon (IFN). Type 1 IFN has been used widely as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of MS and has been shown to be therapeutic in EAE with adoptive transfer of Th1 lymphocytes. However, type 1 IFN is known to exacerbate EAE with adoptive transfer of Th17 lymphocytes. Indeed, the amyloid fibril-forming peptide Tau 623-628 was therapeutic in Th1 adoptively transferred EAE, but ineffective in Th17 adoptively transferred EAE. However, the therapeutic effect of Tau 623-628 was restored in IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) knockout mice, indicating that other immune pathways independent of type 1 IFN induction play a role in the amelioration of EAE. Moreover, Amylin 28-33, a polar, non-ionizable peptide that does not form fibrils as rapidly as Tau 623-628, induces a small fraction of type 1 IFN compared to Tau 623-628 and is therapeutic in Th17 EAE. The diverse immunological pathways modulated by the self-assembling hexapeptides are under investigation with a goal to develop novel, safe, and potent therapeutics for neuroinflammation.

In this study we analyzed the gene expression of histamine receptor 1 (HRH1), HRH2 and HRH4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, secondary-progressive (SP) MS, primary-progressive (PP) MS, and healthy controls (HC). We found that HRH1 transcript was significantly down-modulated in SP-MS compared with HC, and HRH4 was increased in this group compared to HC, CIS and RR-MS. No other differences in the expression of histamine receptors were observed between HC, CIS and other clinical forms of definite MS.

Their application of the animal model, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), for the discovery of Copaxone, opened a new path for testing of drug candidates in MS. By measuring clinical, pathologic, and immunologic outcomes, the biological implications of new drugs could be elucidated. Using EAE they established the efficacy of Copaxone as a therapy for preventing and reducing paralysis and inflammation in the central nervous system without massive immune suppression. This had a huge impact on the field of drug discovery for MS. Much like the use of parabiosis to discover soluble factors associated with obesity, or the replica plating system to probe antibiotic resistance in bacteria, the pioneering research on Copaxone using the EAE model, paved the way for the discovery of other therapeutics in MS, including Natalizumab and Fingolimod. Future applications of this approach may well elucidate novel therapies for the neurodegenerative phase of multiple sclerosis associated with disease progression.

For over 30 years, a small group of investigators have shown that the rare paraneoplastic syndromes are caused by immunity to shared antigens found on both tumors and on components of the nervous system. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Blachre et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2014. 44: 3240-3251] elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tolerance to neuronal antigens which share epitopes with oncologic antigens, observed in the context of paraneoplastic syndromes in mice. The presence of the shared tumor antigen on a nonhematopoietic cell underlies the basis for a certain level of tolerance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, preventing these cells from attacking the brain, but allowing them to lyse the tumor upon transfer into tumor-bearing recipient mice. Comparisons between the paraneoplastic syndromes and the new autoimmune conditions seen with antibodies to immune checkpoints at CD152 or at CD279 are likely to illuminate shared mechanisms and solutions to these vexing diseases.

The most significant developments in neuroimmunology will involve explorations of the roles for the immune system in neurodegenerative conditions often associated with the presence of amyloid deposits. Here I present my personal perspectives on four of the most intriguing challenges that we face in the future of neuroimmunology: (1) Why are the traditional hallmarks of innate and adaptive inflammation conspicuously absent from brains of individuals with prion disease and amyloid pathology? (2) What is the role of adaptive and innate immunity in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis? (3) Is molecular mimicry an adequate explanation for the initiation of neuroinflammatory disease and for exacerbations in conditions like multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, and neuromyelitis optica? (4) Do neural pathways regulate inflammatory diseases outside the nervous system?

A deficiency in costimulatory molecules, such as B7-2, on the NOD genetic background prevents diabetes but instead triggers an inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. This constitutes a shift in the target of autoimmunity, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that NOD mice deficient for isoforms of ICAM-1, which comediate costimulatory functions, spontaneously develop a chronic autoimmune peripheral neuritis instead of diabetes. The disease is transferred by CD4(+) T cells, which infiltrate peripheral nerves together with macrophages and B cells and are autoreactive against peripheral myelin protein zero. These Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit unaltered numbers of regulatory T cells, but increased IL-17-producing T cells, which determine the severity, but not the target specificity, of autoimmunity. Ab-mediated ICAM-1 blockade triggers neuritis only in young NOD mice. Thymic epithelium from Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice features an altered expression of costimulatory molecules and induces neuritis and myelin autoreactivity after transplantation into nude mice in vivo. Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit a specifically altered TCR repertoire. Our findings introduce a novel animal model of chronic inflammatory neuropathies and indicate that altered expression of ICAM-1 on thymic epithelium shifts autoimmunity specifically toward peripheral nerves. This improves our understanding of autoimmunity in the peripheral nervous system with potential relevance for human diseases.

The CSF aquaporin-4 antibody levels during attacks (but not in sera) closely correlated with pleocytosis, inflammatory cytokines plasmablasts, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in the CSF. The amount of aquaporin-4 antibodies present in the central nervous system may have therapeutic implications, as it is associated with astrocyte injury and inflammatory responses during NMOSD attacks.

In 2001 we noted that aB crystallin (cryab) was the most abundant transcript found in MS lesions, but not in healthy brains. Cryab can reverse paralysis and attenuate inflammation in several models of inflammation including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and various models of ischemia. Cryab is an amyloid forming molecule. We have identified a core structure common to many amyloids including amyloid protein A A4, tau, amylin, prion protein, serum amyloid protein P, and cryab. The core hexapeptide structure is highly immune suppressive and can reverse paralysis in EAE when administered systemically.

These included previously described protein- and lipid-based antigenic targets and newly discovered autoimmunogenic sugar moieties, notably, autoantibodies specific for the oligomannoses in both MS patient CSF and the sera of mice with EAE. These glycans are often masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of cryptic autoantigens. We further determined that these targets are highly expressed on multiple cell types in MS and EAE lesions. Co-immunization of SJL/J mice with a Man9-KLH conjugate at the time of EAE induction elicited highly significant levels of anti-Man9-cluster autoantibodies. Nevertheless, this anti-glycan autoantibody response was associated with a significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE. The potential of these cryptic glycan markers and targeting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions of neurological disorders has yet to be explored.

One goal is the development of safe and effective therapy for autoimmune diseases. Another definition of goal is to score, and this would ultimately mean the development of an approved drug. Indeed, the efforts in my four decades at Stanford, have included the discovery and subsequent development of a monoclonal antibody to block homing to the inflamed brain, leading to natalizumab, an approved therapeutic for two autoimmune diseases: relapsing-remitting MS and for inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple attempts to develop new therapies for autoimmune disease are described here: The trimolecular complex and the immune synapse serve as one major set of targets, with attempts to inhibit particular major histocompatibility molecules, the variable regions of the T cell receptor, and CD4. Other approaches focusing on antigen-specific tolerance include ongoing attempts with tolerizing DNA vaccines in type 1 diabetes. Finally, the repurposing of popular drugs approved for other indications, including statins and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme is under development and showing promise in the clinic, particularly for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The milieu within Stanford Immunology has helped to nurture these efforts to translate discoveries in immunology and to take them from bench to bedside.

The reports of increased cases of narcolepsy in non-vaccinated subjects infected with wild A(H1N1) pandemic influenza virus suggest a role for the viral antigen(s) in disease development. However, additional investigations are needed to better understand what factor(s) in wild influenza infection trigger(s) narcolepsy in susceptible hosts. An estimated 31 million doses of European AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine were used in more than 47 countries. The Canadian AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine was used with high coverage in Canada where an estimated 12 million doses were administered. As no similar narcolepsy association has been reported to date with the AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine made using the Canadian inactivation/purification protocol, this suggests that the AS03 adjuvant alone may not be responsible for the narcolepsy association. To date, no narcolepsy association has been reported with the MF59-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine. This review article provides a brief background on narcolepsy, outlines the different types of vaccine preparations including the ones for influenza, reviews the accumulated evidence for the safety of adjuvants, and explores the association between autoimmune diseases and natural infections. It concludes by assimilating the historical observations and recent clinical studies to formulate a feasible hypothesis on why vaccine-associated narcolepsy may not be solely linked to the AS03 adjuvant but more likely be linked to how the specific influenza antigen component of the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine was prepared. Careful and long-term epidemiological studies of subjects who developed narcolepsy in association with AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine prepared with the European inactivation/purification protocol are needed.

We discovered unexpectedly that the antiviral drug ganciclovir (GCV) inhibits the proliferation of microglia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as in kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity. In EAE, GCV largely prevented infiltration of T lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) and drastically reduced disease incidence and severity when delivered before the onset of disease. In contrast, GCV treatment had minimal effects on peripheral leukocyte distribution in EAE and did not inhibit generation of antibodies after immunization with ovalbumin. Additionally, a radiolabeled analogue of penciclovir, [(18)F]FHBG, which is similar in structure to GCV, was retained in areas of CNS inflammation in EAE, but not in naive control mice, consistent with the observed therapeutic effects. Our experiments suggest GCV may have beneficial effects in the CNS beyond its antiviral properties.

Besides inhibiting development of encephalitogenic T cells, atorvastatin treatment of EAE has been associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory myelin-reactive T-helper type (Th)-2 cells. To investigate the clinical significance of atorvastatin-mediated Th2 differentiation, we first evaluated atorvastatin treatment in interleukin (IL)-4 green fluorescent protein-enhanced transcript (4-GET) reporter mice. Atorvastatin treatment failed to induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo; however, when T cells from atorvastatin-treated 4-GET mice were reactivated in vitro, T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 cells, while antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor and IL-12) were reduced. Oral atorvastatin also prevented or reversed EAE in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-deficient (STAT6-/-) mice, which cannot generate IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Further, atorvastatin treatment did not induce or expand Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in either wild-type or STAT6-/- mice. In vivo proliferation of T cells, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, was inhibited in atorvastatin-treated wild-type and STAT6-/- mice. These data imply that atorvastatin ameliorates central nervous system autoimmune disease primarily by inhibiting proliferation of proinflammatory encephalitogenic T cells, and not simply through induction of anti-inflammatory Th2 cells. This cytostatic effect may be a relevant mechanism of action when considering use of statins in MS and other inflammatory conditions.

Glutaric aciduria type I (GA1) is an inherited disorder of lysine and tryptophan metabolism presenting with metabolic stroke in infancy. The clinical presentation includes bilateral striatal necrosis and spontaneous subdural and retinal hemorrhages, which has been frequently misdiagnosed as non-accidental head trauma. The mechanisms underlying metabolic stroke and spontaneous hemorrhage are poorly understood.Using a mouse model of GA1, we show that metabolic stroke progresses in the opposite sequence of ischemic stroke, with initial neuronal swelling and vacuole formation leading to cerebral capillary occlusion. Focal regions of cortical followed by striatal capillaries are occluded with shunting to larger non-exchange vessels leading to early filling and dilation of deep cerebral veins. Blood-brain barrier breakdown was associated with displacement of tight-junction protein Occludin.Together the current findings illuminate the pathophysiology of metabolic stroke and vascular compromise in GA1, which may translate to other neurometabolic disorders presenting with stroke.

We previously showed that a small heat shock protein, CRYAB, reduced T cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and clinical signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a model of MS. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether the ability of CRYAB to reduce the activation of T cells translated to the human disease. METHODS: CD4(+) T cells from healthy controls and volunteers with MS were activated in vitro in the presence or absence of a CRYAB peptide (residues 73-92). Parameters of activation (proliferation rate, cytokine secretion) and tolerance (anergy, activation-induced cell The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CD4(+) T cells was decreased in the presence of CRYAB in a subset of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) participants with mild disease severity while no changes were observed in healthy controls. Further, there was a correlation for higher levels of miR181a microRNA, a marker upregulated in tolerant CD8(+) T cells, in CD4(+) T cells of MS patients that displayed suppressed cytokine production (responders). CONCLUSION: CRYAB may be capable of suppressing the activation of CD4(+) T cells from a subset of RRMS patients who appear to have less disability but similar age and disease duration.

The focus here is on development of a specially engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin to treat T1D. The plasmid is engineered to turn off adaptive immunity to proinsulin. This approach yielded exciting results in a randomized placebo controlled trial in 80 adult patients with T1D. The implications of this trial are explored in regards to the potential for sparing inflammation in islets and thus allowing the functioning beta cells to recover and produce more insulin. Strategies to further strengthen the effects seen thus far with the tolerizing DNA plasmid to proinsulin will be elucidated. The DNA platform affords an opportunity for easy modifications. In addition standard exploration of dose levels, route of administration and frequency of dose are practical. Optimization of the effects seen to date on C-peptide and on depletion of proinsulin specific CD8 T cells are feasible, with expected concomitant improvement in other parameters like hemoglobin A1c and reduction in insulin usage. T1D is one of the few autoimmune conditions where antigen specific therapy can be achieved, provided the approach is tested intelligently. Tolerizing DNA vaccines to proinsulin and other islet cell autoantigens is a worthy pursuit to potentially treat, prevent and to perhaps even 'cure' or 'prevent' type 1 diabetes.

Because autoantibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, we sought to identify autoantibody biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing them. METHODS: We used custom antigen arrays to profile anti-myelin-peptide autoantibodies in sera derived from individuals with pediatric ADEM (n = 15), pediatric multiple sclerosis (Ped MS; n = 11) and adult MS (n = 15). Using isotype-specific secondary antibodies, we profiled both IgG and IgM reactivities. We used Statistical Analysis of Microarrays software to confirm the differences in autoantibody reactivity profiles between ADEM and MS samples. We used Prediction Analysis of Microarrays software to generate and validate prediction algorithms, based on the autoantibody reactivity profiles. RESULTS: ADEM was characterized by myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein, and alpha-B-crystallin. In contrast, MS was characterized by IgM autoantibodies targeting myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte-specific protein. We generated and validated prediction algorithms that distinguish ADEM serum (sensitivity 62-86%; specificity 56-79%) from MS serum (sensitivity 40-87%; specificity 62-86%) on the basis of combined IgG and IgM anti-myelin autoantibody reactivity to a small myelin of serum IgG and IgM autoantibodies identified myelin antigens that may be useful for distinguishing MS from ADEM. Further studies are required to establish clinical utility. Further biological assays are required to delineate the pathogenic potential of these antibodies.

However, the underlying mechanism for these Janus-like activities of type I and II IFNs in neuroinflammation remains unclear. Although endogenous type I IFN signaling provides a protective response in neuroinflammation, we find that when IFN- signaling is ablated, type I IFNs drive inflammation, resulting in exacerbated EAE. IFN- has a disease stage-specific opposing function in EAE. Treatment of mice with IFN- during the initiation phase of EAE leads to enhanced severity of disease. In contrast, IFN- treatment during the effector phase attenuated disease. This immunosuppressive activity of IFN- required functional type I IFN signaling. In IFN-/ receptor-deficient mice, IFN- treatment during effector phase of EAE exacerbated disease. Using an adoptive transfer EAE model, we found that T cell-intrinsic type I and II IFN signals are simultaneously required to establish chronic EAE by encephalitogenic Th1 cells. However, in Th17 cells loss of either IFN signals leads to the development of a severe chronic disease. The data imply that type I and II IFN signals have independent but nonredundant roles in restraining encephalitogenic Th17 cells in vivo. Collectively, our data show that type I and II IFNs function in an integrated manner to regulate pathogenesis in EAE.

OBJECTIVE To further investigate the role of IL-17F in predicting treatment response to interferon beta-1b in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis using the Singulex Erenna IL-17F immunoassay. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Serum samples were analyzed from 239 randomly selected patients treated with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years in the Betaferon Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose Study. EXPOSURE Treatment with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Levels of IL-17F at baseline and month 6 as well as the difference between the IL-17F levels at month 6 and baseline were compared between the following: (1) patients with less disease activity vs more disease activity; (2) patients with no disease activity vs some disease activity; and (3) responders vs nonresponders. RESULTS Levels of IL-17F measured at baseline and month 6 did not correlate with lack of response to treatment after 2 years using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Relapses and new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were not associated with pretreatment serum IL-17F levels. When patients with neutralizing antibodies were excluded, the results did not change. All patients with levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL were associated with poor response with some clinical or radiological activity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An increase of IL-17F before and early after treatment with interferon beta-1b was not associated with poor response. These data do not support the value of IL-17F as a treatment response indicator for therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis with interferon beta, although high levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL may predict nonresponsiveness.

We investigate in this study how murine Th cells influence the phenotype and function of monocytes. The data demonstrate that Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets II(+), CD11b(+), CD11c(+) DC that we call DCTh. Although all Th subsets induce the formation of DCTh, activated Th17 cells uniquely promote the formation of IL-12/IL-23-producing DCTh (DCTh17) that can polarize both naive and to a Th1 phenotype. In the inflamed CNS of mice with Th17-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Th cells colocalize with DC, as well as monocytes, and the Th cells obtained from these lesions drive the formation of DCTh that are phenotypically indistinguishable from DCTh17 and polarize naive T cells toward a Th1 phenotype. These results suggest that DCTh17 are critical in the interplay of Th17- and Th1-mediated responses and may explain the previous finding that IL-17-secreting Th cells become IFN--secreting Th1 cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and other autoimmune disorders.

In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.

However, within the RRMS population, 30-50% of MS patients are nonresponsive to this treatment, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a disease once considered to be a form of RRMS. In contrast to RRMS, type I IFNs have been shown to have properties that drive the inflammatory pathologies in many other autoimmune diseases. These diseases include Sjgren's syndrome, system lupus erythematosus (SLE), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Historically, autoimmune diseases were thought to be driven by a TH1 response to auto-antigens. However, since the discovery of the TH17 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is now generally thought that TH17 plays an important role in MS and all other autoimmune diseases. In this article, we will discuss recent clinical and basic research advances in the field of autoimmunity and argue that IFN- and other type I IFNs are immuno-modulatory in diseases driven predominantly by TH1 but in contrast are inflammatory in diseases that have a predominant Th17 response.

Our previous data in the NOD mouse demonstrated that co-administration of antigen (insulin) with anti-CD3 antibody (a T cell-directed immunomodulator) offers better protection than either entity alone, indicating that novel combination therapies that include a T1D-related autoantigen are possible. To accelerate the identification and development of novel combination therapies that can be advanced into the clinic, we have evaluated the combination of a mouse anti-CD20 antibody with either oral insulin or a proinsulin-expressing DNA vaccine. Anti-CD20 alone, given once or on 4 consecutive days, produced transient B cell depletion but did not prevent or reverse T1D in the NOD mouse. Oral insulin alone (twice weekly for 6 weeks) was also ineffective, while proinsulin DNA (weekly for up to 12 weeks) showed a trend toward modest efficacy. Combination of anti-CD20 with oral insulin was ineffective in reversing diabetes in NOD mice whose glycemia was controlled with SC insulin pellets; these experiments were performed in three independent labs. Combination of anti-CD20 with proinsulin DNA was also ineffective in diabetes reversal, but did show modest efficacy in diabetes prevention (p = 0.04). In the prevention studies, anti-CD20 plus proinsulin resulted in modest increases in Tregs in pancreatic lymph nodes and elevated levels of proinsulin-specific CD4+ T-cells that produced IL-4. Thus, combination therapy with anti-CD20 and either oral insulin or proinsulin does not protect hyperglycemic NOD mice, but the combination with proinsulin offers limited efficacy in T1D prevention, potentially by augmentation of proinsulin-specific IL-4 production.

Natalizumab was granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004, only 12 years after its molecular target was cloned. Shortly after initial approval, natalizumab use was suspended pending a safety review when several natalizumab recipients were diagnosed as having progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. After the safety review, natalizumab was reintroduced to the market in 2006. Since then, more than 92,000 patients have been treated with the drug. Risk stratification algorithms and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy management strategies have been developed, which facilitate more personalized decision making and safer natalizumab use. This review article summarizes the evolution of natalizumab from target molecule discovery through regulatory approval, voluntary suspension, reapproval, and clinical use. The natalizumab story highlights both the opportunities and risks inherent in a novel biological therapy for a progressive neurologic disease.

Following a recent Stanford study which reported that pretreatment levels of serum interleukin (IL)-17F could predict poor response to interferon- (IFN) therapy, we sought to validate the finding using samples from a large clinical trial.The validation cohort included 54 good responders (GR) and 64 poor responders (PR) selected from 762 subjects with RRMS from the IM IFN-1a dose comparison study (Avonex study C94-805). Subjects were classified as GR and PR based on the number of relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and new and enlarging T2 lesions on MRI. Serum samples were assayed using a multiplexed Luminex assay and for IL-17F/F using an ELISA. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study were also assayed to assure reproducibility of methods.Median pretreatment and post-treatment serum IL-17F levels were not statistically significantly different between GR and PR, and serum IL-7/IL-17F ratios were also not predictive of response status. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study showed good correlation to their original cohort (r = 0.77).We were unable to validate the finding that serum IL-17F is a predictor of PR in a large independent cohort of subjects with RRMS. Differences in patient populations and methodology might explain the failure to validate the results from the Stanford study.

Scientists in both fields study a structure known as the synapse, and each group analyzes a subject called memory. Is this a quirk of human language, or are there real similarities between these two physiological systems? Not only are the linguistic concepts expressed in the words \"synapse\" and \"memory\" shared between the fields, but the actual molecules of physiologic importance in one system play parallel roles in the other: complement, the major histocompatibility molecules, and even \"neuro\"-transmitters all have major impacts on health and on disease in both the brain and the immune system. Not only are the same molecules found in diverse roles in each system, but we have learned that there is real \"hard-wired\" crosstalk between nerves and lymphoid organs. This issue of the JCI highlights some of the lessons learned from experts who are working at this scintillating intersection between immunology and neuroscience.

However, recent studies looking at the role of sHSPs in neurological diseases have demonstrated a near universal upregulation of certain sHSPs in damaged and diseased brains. Initially, it was thought that sHSPs are pathological in these disease states because they are found in the areas of damage.

Although considered a T cell-mediated disease, multiple sclerosis involves the activation of both adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as resident cells of the central nervous system, which synergize in inducing inflammation and thereby demyelination. Differentiation, survival, and inflammatory functions of innate immune cells and of astrocytes of the central nervous system are regulated by tyrosine kinases. Here, we show that imatinib, sorafenib, and GW2580-small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors-can each prevent the development of disease and treat established disease in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In vitro, imatinib and sorafenib inhibited astrocyte proliferation mediated by the tyrosine platelet-derived factor receptor (PDGFR), whereas GW2580 and sorafenib inhibited macrophage tumor necrosis factor production mediated by tyrosine kinases c-Fms and PDGFR, respectively. In vivo, amelioration of disease by GW2580 was associated with a reduction in the proportion of macrophages and T cells in the CNS infiltrate, as well as a reduction in the levels of circulating TNF. Our findings suggest that GW2580 and the FDA-approved drugs imatinib and sorafenib have potential as novel therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune demyelinating disease.

However, the precise role in allograft rejection remains uncertain. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17 in acute allograft rejection using IL-17-deficient mice.Donor hearts from FVB mice were transplanted into either C57BL/6J-IL-17-deficient (IL-17(-/-)) or -wild-type mice. Allograft survival was significantly prolonged in IL-17(-/-) recipient mice due to reduced local inflammation accompanied by decreased inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine expression. IL-17(-/-) recipient mice exhibited decreased IL-6 production and reciprocally enhanced regulatory T cell expansion, suggesting a contribution of regulatory T cells to prolonged allograft survival. Indeed, allografts transplanted into anti-CD25 mAb-treated IL-17(-/-) recipient mice (regulatory T cell-depleted) developed acute rejection similar to wild-type recipient mice. Surprisingly, we found that gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were key IL-17 producers in the allografts. In support, equivalent allograft rejection was observed in Rag-2(-/-) recipient mice engrafted with either wild-type or IL-17(-/-) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Finally, hearts transplanted into gamma delta T cell-deficient mice resulted in decreased allograft rejection compared with wild-type controls.During heart transplantation, (1) IL-17 is crucial for acceleration of acute rejection; (2) IL-17-deficiency enhances regulatory T cell expansion; and (3) gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are a potential source of IL-17. IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3. Our results describe novel mechanisms and new concepts with regard to vitamin D and the immune system and suggest therapeutic targets for the control of autoimmune diseases.

Recently, we showed that a T helper 1 (T(H)1)-driven, but not a T(H)17-driven, form of MS exhibited a good clinical response to interferon- (IFN-) therapy. We now demonstrate that high serum levels of IL-7, particularly when paired with low levels of IL-17F, predict responsiveness to IFN- and hence a T(H)1-driven subtype of MS. We also show that although IL-7 signaling is neither necessary nor sufficient for the induction or expansion of T(H)17 cells, IL-7 can greatly enhance both human and mouse T(H)1 cell differentiation. IL-7 alone is sufficient to induce human T(H)1 differentiation in the absence of IL-12 or other cytokines. Furthermore, targeting IL-7/IL-7R is beneficial in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Mice treated with IL-7R-blocking antibodies before or after onset of paralysis exhibited reduced clinical signs of EAE, with reduction in peripheral nave and activated T cells, whereas central memory T, regulatory T, B, and natural killer cell populations were largely spared. IL-7R antibody treatment markedly reduced lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system in mice with EAE. Thus, a serum profile of high IL-7 may signify a T(H)1-driven form of MS and may predict outcome in MS patients undergoing IFN- therapy. Blockade of IL-7 and the IL-7R pathway may have therapeutic potential in MS and other autoimmune diseases.

Apoptosis was then assessed by western blot (Bcl-2, day 40, CryAB-treated mice had a 1.8-fold increase in left ventricular ejection fraction versus control mice (27%6% versus 15%4% SD, p<0.005). In vitro, (1) the HL-1 cells showed no significant difference in apoptotic protein expression, cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, or caspase-3 activity; (2) the HMEC-1 cells had increased but not significant apoptotic protein expression with, however, a significant decrease in cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (1.5-fold, p<0.01) and caspase-3 activity CryAB administration significantly improves cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion injury, in vivo. The protective anti-apoptotic affects of CryAB may target the endothelial cell.

Total serum 25(OH)D levels were measured using the DiaSorin Liaison Assay during the third trimester and 2, 4, and 6 months after giving birth. The data were analyzed using longitudinal multivariable methods.Levels of 25(OH)D and relapse rate.Fourteen (50%) women breastfed exclusively, and 12 women (43%) relapsed within 6 months after giving birth. During pregnancy, the average 25(OH)D levels were 25.4 ng/mL (range, 13.7-42.6) and were affected only by season (P=.009). In contrast, in the postpartum period, 25(OH)D levels were significantly affected by breastfeeding and relapse status. Levels of 25(OH)D remained low in the exclusive breastfeeding group, yet rose significantly in the nonexclusive breastfeeding group regardless of season (P=.007, unadjusted; P=.02, adjusted for season). By 4 and 6 months after childbirth, 25(OH)D levels were, on average, 5 ng/mL lower in the women who breastfed exclusively compared with the nonbreastfeeding group (P=.001).Pregnancy and exclusive breastfeeding are strongly associated with low 25(OH)D levels in women with MS. However, these lower vitamin D levels were not associated with an increased risk of postpartum MS relapses. These data suggest that low vitamin D in isolation is not an important risk factor for postpartum MS relapses.

We here report genome-wide association analyses for narcolepsy with replication and fine mapping across three ethnic groups (3,406 individuals of European ancestry, 2,414 Asians and 302 African Americans). We identify a SNP in the 3' untranslated region of P2RY11, the purinergic subtype P2Y gene, which is associated with narcolepsy (rs2305795, combined P = 6.1 10, odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.39, n = 5689). The disease-associated expression of in CD8(+) T lymphocytes (339% reduced, P = 0.003) and natural killer (NK) cells (P = 0.031), but not in other peripheral blood mononuclear cell types. The low expression variant is also associated with reduced P2RY11-mediated resistance to ATP-induced cell death in T lymphocytes (P = 0.0007) and natural killer cells (P = 0.001). These results identify P2RY11 as an important regulator of immune-cell survival, with possible implications in narcolepsy and other autoimmune diseases.

We have devised large scale arrays to measure the antibody response to myelin proteins and lipids. Despite the widespread immune responses to myelin, we have devised an inverse vaccine aimed at turning off key drivers of this diverse response.

However, expression of RAAS components has recently been detected in immune cells, and the RAAS has been implicated in several mouse models of autoimmune disease. Here, we have identified Ang II as a paracrine mediator, sustaining inflammation in the CNS in the EAE mouse model of MS via TGF-beta. Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) were found to be primarily expressed in CNS-resident cells during EAE. In vitro, astrocytes and microglia responded to Ang II treatment by inducing TGF-beta expression via a pathway involving the TGF-beta upregulation blocked with candesartan (CA), an inhibitor of AT1R. Treatment of EAE with CA ameliorated paralysis and blunted lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS, outcomes that were also seen with genetic ablation of AT1Ra and treatment with an inhibitor of TSP-1. These data suggest that AT1R antagonists, frequently prescribed as antihypertensives, may be useful to interrupt this proinflammatory, CNS-specific pathway in individuals with MS.

In both groups, serum antibodies display a consistent and prominent reaction to alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) versus other myelin proteins. As an apparently major target for the adaptive immune system in humans, CRYAB selectively accumulates in oligodendrocytes, but not in astrocytes, or axons in so-called preactive multiple sclerosis lesions. These are clusters of activated HLA-DR-expressing microglia in myelinated normal-appearing white matter with no obvious leukocyte infiltration. They are found in most multiple sclerosis patients at all stages of disease. In these lesion areas, CRYAB in oligodendrocytes may come directly in contact with activated HLA-DR+ microglia. We demonstrate that CRYAB activates innate responses by microglia by stimulating the secretion of leukocyte-recruiting factors, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 17, CCL5, and CCL1, and immune-regulatory cytokines such as interleukin 10, transforming growth factor-beta, and interleukin 13. Together, these data suggest that CRYAB accumulation in preactive lesions may be part of a reversible reparative local response that involves both oligodendrocytes and microglia. At the same time, however, accumulated CRYAB may represent a major target for adaptive immune responses that could contribute to progression of preactive lesions to a stage of demyelination.

Here, we examined the consequences of immunostimulatory CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and inhibitory NZW F1 (NZB/W) murine model of SLE. Beginning at 5 months of age, we administered CpG-ODN or GpG-ODN at regular intervals to female NZB/W animals. We also determined the effects of ODN administration on NZB/W mouse lymphocyte function, and the specificity of ODN binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) other than TLR-9. While CpG-ODN treatment did not appear to have a major impact on disease severity, GpG-ODN treatment significantly delayed the onset of proteinuria in NZB/W mice. Interestingly, short-term GpG-ODN treatment promoted Th2-type T and B cell responses, and inhibited B lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. On the other hand, extended GpG-ODN treatment did not result in sustained Th2 responses or significantly reduced renal disease. Moreover, the binding of CpG-ODN and GpG-ODN was not restricted to TLR-9 as both ODNs also interacted with TLR-3, TLR-7, and TLR-8. Taken together, the data indicate that the protective mechanism of GpG-ODN treatment in the NZB/W model of lupus nephritis involves modulating T cell cytokine profiles and B lymphocyte activation through the inhibition of several TLRs, including TLR-7 and TLR-9.

This study illustrates that IL-17 contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic allograft rejection.Utilizing a murine heterotopic heart transplant model system, IL-17-deficient recipient mice had decreased allograft inflammatory cell recruitment, decreased IL-6, MCP-1, and KC production, and reduced graft coronary artery disease (GCAD). Intragraft gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells appear to be the predominant source of IL-17 production.Therefore, IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

Fibrinogen, which can be citrullinated, has recently emerged as a candidate autoantigen. To determine whether autoimmunity against fibrinogen can mediate inflammatory arthritis, we immunized a variety of common mouse strains with fibrinogen and found that DBA/1 and SJL mice developed an inflammatory and erosive arthritis. Mice with fibrinogen-induced arthritis (FIA) possess fibrinogen-reactive T cells that produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. FIA can be adoptively transferred with either plasma or fibrinogen-specific T cells from diseased mice. Mice with FIA possess rheumatoid factor, circulating immune complexes, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide Abs, all of which are characteristic of human RA. These observations demonstrate that fibrinogen is arthritogenic in mice and that the pathogenesis of FIA is mediated by both autoantibodies and fibrinogen-reactive T cells.

Little is known about the acute hospitalization costs and characteristics. We examined the trends in MS hospitalizations from 1993 to 2006.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was searched using the ICD-9 code 340 (MS). Diagnostic, treatment and administrative data were analyzed using basic statistical software.A total of 288,454 hospital admissions with the primary diagnosis of MS occurred between 1993 and 2006, an average of 20,604 admissions annually. The percentage admitted from the emergency department (ED) increased from 19.4 to 60.0% during 1993-2006. The mean cost for each inpatient increased from USD 7,965 to 20,076. The percentage of discharges to home health care increased from 8.6 to 14.9%, and the percentage of discharges to nursing homes and rehabilitation services increased from 8.3 to 22.6%. In 2006, Medicaid patients were significantly more likely to be admitted from the ED (p < 0.001). Medicare payers were significantly more likely to be discharged to a nursing home/rehabilitation (p < 0.0001).National health insurance policies have made measurable effects on MS disease management. MS is becoming more expensive to treat acutely, and improved treatment modalities geared toward decreasing acute flare-ups may provide substantial cost savings by reducing ED visits, inpatient hospitalizations and the need for rehabilitation.

Intervention We prospectively followed up the pregnant women with MS and the age-matched, pregnant controls; conducted structured interviews; and collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells during each trimester and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post partum.Sixteen functional cell types, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)- and tumor necrosis factor-producing T-cell subsets, were measured using multicolor flow cytometry. Since these cell types may also fluctuate with pregnancy, lactational amenorrhea, or MS treatment, the data were analyzed taking into account these factors.Fifteen women with MS (58%) had relapses during the postpartum year. CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells fluctuated with MS relapses, declining during pregnancy in women with MS (P < .001) and continuing to decline after parturition in women with relapses (P = .001), yet rising or remaining stable in women with nonrelapsing MS or healthy pregnant women. Lactational amenorrhea was associated with a rise in CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells in women with MS (P = .009). In contrast, CD4(+) tumor necrosis factor-producing cells decreased during lactational amenorrhea in all groups of women and, once this was taken into account, obscured any relationship to MS relapses. CD8(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells were elevated in women with MS throughout the study (P < .001) but did not fluctuate with relapses.Our findings suggest that a decline in circulating CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells leads to postpartum MS relapses. Our findings also suggest that the decline in these cells may begin during late pregnancy and that lactational amenorrhea induced by exclusive breastfeeding may be able to interrupt this process.

In this perspective I discuss results of clinical trials assessing the effect of blocking the differentiation and/or function of interleukin-17-producing CD4(+) T cells on human autoimmune disease, and devote more limited attention to corroborating preclinical studies from animal models. Thus far, these outcomes in human trials have been mixed, with notable success in psoriasis and Crohn's disease but a negative result in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

GL-26 cells were implanted into the striatum of C5LKa mice treated with either control, low- or high-dose simvastatin. Brains were analyzed for necrotic volume, pericytic cells within the vascular tree.Low-dose simvastatin increased necrosis and apoptosis compared to both control and high-dose simvastatin groups. High-dose simvastatin increased vessel caliber by reducing pericytic cells along the tumor vessel wall compared to both control and low-dose simvastatin groups.Simvastatin has a dual effect on tumorigenesis. At high doses, it may worsen instead of 'normalizing' tumor angio-architecture, albeit low doses affect tumor cell survival by promoting necrosis and apoptosis.

Although factors participating in recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells have been identified, the transcriptional basis for the sensing and the silent disposal of apoptotic cells is unknown. Here we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) is induced when macrophages engulf apoptotic cells and functions as a transcriptional sensor of dying cells. Genetic deletion of PPAR-delta decreases expression of opsonins such as complement component-1qb (C1qb), resulting in impairment of apoptotic cell clearance and reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This increases autoantibody production and predisposes global and macrophage-specific Ppard(-/-) mice to autoimmune kidney disease, a phenotype resembling the human disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, PPAR-delta has a pivotal role in orchestrating the timely disposal of apoptotic cells by macrophages, ensuring that tolerance to self is maintained.

We must integrate the following four facts: first, MS lesions have a signature of IL-6-, IL-17-, osteopontin- and IFN-driven transcriptional activity. Second, MS is worsened with administration of IFN-gamma, the quintessential type 2 IFN and Th1 cytokine. Third, blockade of TNF-alpha worsened MS in clinical trials. Fourth, inhibiting the main driver of Th17, IL-23, failed to modulate relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Against this backdrop, standing outside the framework of the Th1 and Th17 pathways are the type 1 IFN, notably IFN-beta, the most widely used approved therapy for RRMS. A paper in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology demonstrates that IFN-beta suppresses production in CD4(+) T cells of both osteopontin and IL-17. In this commentary, the roles of these two molecules, i.e. osteopontin and IL-17, are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of MS. Osteopontin may be more important than Th1 or Th17 in the pathogenesis of RRMS. Trials targeting this small integrin-binding protein ought to be pursued in RRMS.

However, administration of self-peptides in models of autoimmunity can result in anaphylactic reactions. Although both IgE and IgG1 antibodies might be involved in the development of anaphylaxis to myelin peptides in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, the effector cells and molecules involved are not fully understood. Here we show that systemic anaphylaxis to the self-antigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 can occur in mast cells (Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice) or histamine (histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice), but is prevented in mice lacking IL-4. Treatment of mice with CV6209, a platelet-activating factor antagonist, slightly reduced the incidence of anaphylaxis to self-MOG35-55 in this model, but more effectively protected mice against anaphylaxis to this peptide when self-MOG35-55 was administered in a different immunization protocol that omitted the use of Bordetella pertussis toxin as an adjuvant at the time of immunization. Thus, anaphylactic reactions to self-MOG can occur in the absence of mast cells or histamine, key elements of the classical IgE-, mast cell-, and histamine-dependent pathway of anaphylaxis.

The development of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) vaccines has been problematic due to poor immunogenicity. However, when appropriate targets can be identified, passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against TACAs has been shown to have antitumor activity. Fas ligand (FasL) is a transmembrane protein that induces apoptosis in cells expressing its receptor, Fas. When grafted into mice, FasL-expressing tumor cells break immunologic tolerance to self-antigens and induce antibody-mediated tumor immunity. Here, five IgM mAbs were produced from mice vaccinated with FasL-expressing B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. They recognize various syngeneic and allogeneic murine tumor cell lines. One mAb, TM10, recognizes a range of human tumor cell lines, including melanoma, prostate, and ovarian cancer. It does not bind to untransformed cells. The epitopes recognized by all the mAbs were carbohydrates expressed on proteins. Using carbohydrate microarrays, the antigenic targets of TM10 were found to be high-mannose core structures of N-linked glycans. In normal cells, high-mannose clusters are hidden by extensive saccharide branching but they become exposed in cancer cells as a result of abnormal glycosylation pathways. Vaccination with FasL-expressing tumors therefore enables the immune system to break tolerance to self-antigens, allowing identification of novel TACAs that can form the basis of future humoral anticancer therapy.

In inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal epithelial cells are an important source of chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells. We examined the effect of IL-17 on chemokine expression of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells. For CXCL10, IL-17 strongly inhibited promoter activity but had no effect on mRNA stability. In contrast, for CXCL8, IL-17 slightly decreased promoter activity but stabilized its normally unstable mRNA, leading to a net increase in steady-state mRNA abundance. IL-17 synergized with TNF-alpha in transactivating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and in activating ERK and p38 MAPK. The p38 and ERK pathway inhibitors SB203580 and U0126 reversed the repressive effect of IL-17 on CXCL10 mRNA abundance and promoter activity and also reversed the inductive effect of IL-17 on CXCL8 mRNA, indicating that MAPK signaling mediates both the transcriptional repression of CXCL10 and IL-17. The kinase IL-17 CXCL8 and CXCL10 mRNA, demonstrating a role for EGFR in downstream IL-17 signaling. The overall results indicate a positive effect of IL-17 on chemokines that recruit neutrophils (CXCL8 and CCR5, three chemokines that selectively recruit Th1 but not other effector T cells.

Here, we analyzed the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I T10 and T22-specific gammadelta T cells in mice and found that encountering antigen in the thymus was neither required nor inhibitory for their development. But when triggered through the T cell receptor, ligand-naive lymphoid-gammadelta T cells produced IL-17, whereas ligand-experienced cells made IFN-gamma. Immediately after immunization, a large fraction of IL-17(+) gammadelta T cells were found in the draining lymph nodes days before the appearance of antigen-specific IL-17(+) *beta T cells. Thus, thymic selection determines the effector fate of gammadelta T cells rather than constrains their antigen specificities. The swift IL-17 response mounted by antigen-naive gammadelta T cells suggests a critical role for these cells at the onset of an acute inflammatory response to novel antigens.

The results of initial clinical trials with statins in multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis have also been encouraging. In this study, we attempted to treat a widely studied murine model of spontaneous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with atorvastatin.(NZB x NZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mice received daily oral doses of atorvastatin for 20 weeks. The mice were monitored weekly for survival and proteinuria. Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels in sera enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). T lymphocyte cytokine production in vitro, as well as cytokine levels in vivo, were measured by ELISA. T cell proliferation was assessed by thymidine incorporation assay. Serum cholesterol levels were determined using a standard fluorometric assay. Kidney tissue was harvested and evaluated for pathologic changes.In NZB/NZW mice, oral atorvastatin had significant effects on T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. Atorvastatin also induced significant increases in serum levels of interleukin-4. However, atorvastatin treatment in NZB/NZW mice had no significant impact on proteinuria, survival, serum anti-dsDNA antibody and cholesterol levels, or extent of renal disease.Monotherapy with oral atorvastatin has no protective effects in a murine model of spontaneous SLE. The efficacy of atorvastatin in human SLE remains to be determined.

Nonetheless, in mice with a lethal recessive liver disease (tyrosinaemia), transplantation of wild-type BMDCs restored liver function by cell fusion and prevented death, indicating that cell fusion can have beneficial effects. Here we report that chronic inflammation resulting from severe dermatitis or autoimmune encephalitis leads to robust fusion of BMDCs with Purkinje neurons and formation of hundreds of binucleate heterokaryons per cerebellum, a 10-100-fold higher frequency than previously reported. Single haematopoietic stem-cell transplants showed that the fusogenic cell is from the haematopoietic lineage and parabiosis experiments revealed that fusion can occur without irradiation. Transplantation of rat bone marrow into mice led to activation of dormant rat Purkinje neuron-specific genes in BMDC nuclei after fusion with mouse Purkinje neurons, consistent with nuclear reprogramming. The precise neurological role of these heterokaryons awaits elucidation, but their frequency in brain after inflammation is clearly much higher than previously appreciated.

We developed a mouse model in which anaphylaxis is induced in SJL mice by immunization and challenge with the fragment of self myelin proteolipid protein (PLP)(139-151), that is not expressed in the thymus, but not with fragment 178-191 of the same protein, that is expressed in the thymus. In this study, we show that resistance to anaphylaxis is associated with naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for the self peptide expressed in the thymus. These cells increase Foxp3 expression upon Ag stimulation and suppress peptide-induced proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells. Depletion of Tregs with anti-CD25 in vivo significantly diminished resistance to anaphylaxis to PLP(178-191), suggesting an important role for CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs in preventing the development of allergic responses to this thymus-expressed peptide. These data indicate that naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for a peptide expressed under physiological conditions in the thymus are able to suppress the development of a systemic allergic reaction to self.

Bioluminescence in the brain and spinal cord was measured non-invasively in living mice. Mice were sacrificed at different time points to evaluate clinical and pathological changes. The correlation between bioluminescence and clinical and pathological EAE was statistically analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis.Bioluminescence from the brain and spinal cord correlates strongly with severity of clinical disease and a number of pathological changes in the brain in EAE. Bioluminescence at early time points also predicts severity of disease.These results highlight the potential use of bioluminescence imaging to monitor neuroinflammation for rapid drug screening and immunological studies in EAE and suggest that similar approaches could be applied to other animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.

Citrullination is the post-translational conversion of peptidyl arginine deiminase, and increased citrullination of proteins is observed in the joint tissue in RA and in brain tissue in multiple sclerosis (MS).We applied synovial and myelin protein arrays to examine epitope spreading of B cell responses to citrullinated epitopes in both the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model for RA and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model for MS. Synovial and myelin protein arrays contain a spectrum of proteins and peptides, including native and citrullinated forms, representing candidate autoantigens in RA and MS, respectively. We applied these arrays to characterise the specificity of autoantibodies in serial serum samples derived from mice with acute and chronic stages of CIA and EAE.In samples from pre-disease CIA and acute-disease EAE, we observed autoantibody targeting of the immunising antigen and responses to a limited set of citrullinated epitopes. Over the course of diseases, the autoantibody responses expanded to target multiple citrullinated epitopes in both CIA and EAE. Using immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified citrullination of multiple polypeptides in CIA joint and EAE brain tissue that have not previously been described as citrullinated.Our results suggest that anti-citrulline antibody responses develop in the early stages of CIA and EAE, and that autoimmune inflammation results in citrullination of joint proteins in CIA and brain proteins in EAE, thereby creating neoantigens that become additional targets in epitope spreading of autoimmune responses.

AT treatment of the donor induced a Th-2 cytokine profile in the adoptively transferred T cells and reduced their in vivo expansion, which translated into significantly reduced aGVHD lethality. Host treatment down-regulated costimulatory molecules and MHC class II expression on recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and enhanced the protective statin effect, without impacting graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. The AT effect was partially reversed in STAT6(-/-) donors and abrogated by L-mevalonate, indicating the relevance of STAT6 signaling and the L-mevalonate pathway for AT-mediated aGVHD protection. AT reduced prenylation levels of GTPases, abolished T-bet expression, and increased c-MAF and GATA-3 protein in vivo. Thus, AT has significant protective impact on aGVHD lethality by Th-2 polarization and inhibition of an uncontrolled Th-1 response while maintaining GVL activity, which is of great clinical relevance given the modest toxicity profile of AT.

We found that TGF-beta1 synthesis in glial cells and TGF-beta-induced signaling in the CNS were activated several days before the onset of paralysis in mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis. While early production of TGF-beta1 was observed in glial cells TGF-beta signaling was activated in neurons and later in infiltrating T cells in inflammatory lesions. Systemic treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling ameliorated the paralytic disease and reduced the accumulation of pathogenic T cells and expression of IL-6 in the CNS. Priming of peripheral T cells was not altered, nor was the generation of TH17 cells, indicating that this effect was directed within the brain, yet affected the immune system. These results suggest that early production of TGF-beta1 in the CNS creates a permissive and dangerous environment for the initiation of autoimmune inflammation, providing a rare example of the brain modulating the immune system. Importantly, inhibition of TGF-beta signaling may have benefits in the treatment of the acute phase of autoimmune CNS inflammation.

Tryptophan sequestration by up-regulation of the key enzyme for tryptophan degradation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), e.g., in cancer and inflammation, is thought to suppress the immune response via T cell starvation. Additionally, the excreted tryptophan catabolites (kynurenines) induce apoptosis of lymphocytes. Whereas tryptophan transport systems have been identified, the molecular nature of kynurenine export remains unknown. To measure cytosolic tryptophan steady-state levels and flux in real time, we developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer nanosensors (FLIPW). The transport properties detected by FLIPW in KB cells, a human oral cancer cell line, and COS-7 cells implicate LAT1, a transporter that is present in proliferative tissues like cancer, in tryptophan uptake. Importantly, we found that this transport system mediates tryptophan/kynurenine exchange. The tryptophan influx/kynurenine efflux cycle couples tryptophan elevation serum levels, providing a two-pronged induction of apoptosis in neighboring cells. The strict coupling protects cells that overproduce IDO from kynurenine accumulation. Consequently, this mechanism may contribute to immunosuppression involved in autoimmunity and tumor immune escape.

Several reports document that statins may prevent different human cancers. However, whether or not statins can prevent cancer is controversial due to discordant results. One possible explanation for these conflicting conclusions is that only some tumors or specific statins may be effective. Here, we demonstrate in an in vivo transgenic model in which atorvastatin reverses and prevents the onset of MYC-induced lymphomagenesis, but fails to reverse or prevent tumorigenesis in the presence of constitutively activated fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, atorvastatin treatment was found to result in the inactivation of the Ras and ERK1/2 signaling pathways associated with the dephosphorylation and inactivation of MYC. Correspondingly, tumors with a constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D) did not exhibit dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MYC. Atorvastatin's effects on MYC were specific to the inhibition of HMGcoA reductase, as treatment with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, abrogated these effects and inhibited the ability of atorvastatin to reverse or suppress tumorigenesis. Also, RNAi directed at HMGcoA reductase was sufficient to abrogate the neoplastic properties of MYC-induced tumors. Thus, atorvastatin, by inhibiting HMGcoA reductase, induces changes in phosphoprotein signaling that in turn prevent MYC-induced lymphomagenesis.

This anti-inflammatory cytokine shift was associated with reduced STAT-1 signaling. Type II monocytes directed differentiation of T(H)2 cells and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (T(reg)) independent of antigen specificity. Type II monocyte-induced regulatory T cells specific for a foreign antigen ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating that neither GA specificity nor recognition of self-antigen was required for their therapeutic effect. Adoptive transfer of type II monocytes reversed EAE, suppressed T(H)17 cell development and promoted both T(H)2 differentiation and expansion of T(reg) cells in recipient mice. This demonstration of adoptive immunotherapy by type II monocytes identifies a central role for these cells in T cell immune modulation of autoimmunity.

We developed a sensitive assay based on self-assembling radiolabeled tetramers that allows discrimination of antibodies against folded or denatured myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) by selective unfolding of the antigen domain. The tetramer radioimmunoassay (RIA) was more sensitive for MOG autoantibody detection than other methodologies, including monomer-based RIA, ELISA or fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). Autoantibodies from individuals with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) selectively bound the folded MOG tetramer, whereas sera from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced with MOG peptide immunoprecipitated only the unfolded tetramer. MOG-specific autoantibodies were identified in a subset of ADEM but only rarely in adult-onset MS cases, indicating that MOG is a more prominent target antigen in ADEM than MS.

We report that expression of HO-1 dictates the pathologic outcome of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Induction of EAE in Hmox1(-/- )C57BL/6 mice led to enhanced CNS demyelination, paralysis, and mortality, as compared with Hmox1(+/+) mice. Induction of HO-1 by cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) administration after EAE onset reversed paralysis in C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice and disease relapse in SJL/J mice. These effects were not observed using zinc protoporphyrin IX, which does not induce HO-1. CoPPIX protection was abrogated in Hmox1(-/-) C57BL/6 mice, indicating that CoPPIX acts via HO-1 to suppress EAE progression. The protective effect of HO-1 was associated with inhibition of MHC class II expression by APCs and inhibition of Th and CD8 T cell accumulation, proliferation, and effector function within the CNS. Exogenous CO mimicked these effects, suggesting that CO contributes to the protective action of HO-1. In conclusion, HO-1 or exposure to its end product CO counters autoimmune neuroinflammation and thus might be used therapeutically to treat MS.

In this paper we describe development of antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines to treat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, and use of protein microarrays to monitor response to therapy and to identify potential additional autoimmune targets for next generation vaccines. We demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding type II collagen (CII) reduced the incidence and severity of CIA. Atorvastatin, a statin drug found to reduce the severity of autoimmunity, potentiated the effect of DNA vaccines encoding CII. Analysis of cytokines produced by collagen-reactive T cells derived from mice receiving tolerizing DNA encoding CII, as compared to control vaccines, revealed reduced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Arthritis microarray analysis demonstrated reduced spreading of autoantibody responses in mice treated with DNA encoding CII. The development of tolerizing DNA vaccines, and the use of antibody profiling to guide design of and to monitor therapeutic responses to such vaccines, represents a promising approach for the treatment of RA and other autoimmune diseases.

Over recent years, statins have also been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects that might be of therapeutic benefit in autoimmune disorders. The primary mechanism by which statins alter immune function appears to be mediated through the inhibition of post-translational protein prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins and is largely independent of lipid-lowering. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), statins prevent or reverse paralysis and were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit when combined with agents approved for MS therapy. Based primarily upon the beneficial effects in EAE, statins are now being tested in patients in MS clinical trials.

(2) Can genetic mutations of key structures produce tissue pathology and thus provoke autoimmunity? (3) Can acute immune damage produce tissue degeneration without further hallmarks of an immune response? (4) Can intermediary metabolism modulate immune damage to tissues? Four answers are given: (1) Tissue injury itself may lead to autoimmunity. Both innate and adaptive immunity may arise as a response to tissue injury, and the immune attack can further damage tissue. (2) Genetic mutations can lead to an immune response indistinguishable from autoimmunity, exemplified from Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. (3) Chronic immune damage may lead to tissue degeneration, with or without further hallmarks of an immune response. Variations on this theme, including inverse scenarios, are also possible: Inborn errors of metabolism may lead to tissue damage that may provoke an adaptive and or innate immune response. The immune response might further damage tissue. (4) Finally, perturbations of intermediary metabolism may modulate the immune response, controlling the extent of immune-mediated damage. Examples are taken from perturbations in the cholesterol pathway that influence the characteristics of the immune response, and with tryptophan metabolites that modulate autoimmunity and graft rejection. Inflammatory, degenerative, and autoimmune neurological disease will be discussed in terms of their implications for pathogenic mechanisms underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Several new approaches to MS are in clinical trials based on positive indications in preclinical work relying on EAE. New clues to the pathogenesis of MS and new potential surrogate markers for MS are shown from research involving EAE when it is critically coupled with actual findings in MS. There are pitfalls in overreliance on the EAE model, or on any animal model for any human disease. Nevertheless, over the past 73 years, the EAE model has proved itself remarkably useful for aiding research on MS.

Therapeutically, targeting the Nogo-A protein by means of the immune response has been tried in an attempt to block neurite growth inhibition and promote regeneration in spinal cord injury models; the immune response to Nogo-A, however, has not been extensively studied. We propose to review recent evidence that Nogo-A may also play an important role in autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, including that Nogo-66 derived epitopes are encephalitogenic antigens in susceptible mouse strains, and that the immune response to Nogo-66 antigens includes both strong T cell and B cell activation, with epitope spreading of the antibody response to other myelin molecules. In CNS immunotherapy, careful targeting of neural self-antigens is a prerequisite in order to avoid unexpected deleterious effects, and increasing knowledge about the immune response to Nogo-A may provide a safe basis for the development of relevant therapeutic alternatives for several neurological conditions.

Unveiling the complex interplay of the molecules involved in the immunological cascade of the disease supplies new targets for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies. Similarly, clinical studies and identification of distinct subgroups of patients based on their responsiveness to immunotherapies provides support for the existence of immunopathological disease subtypes that seem to require different therapeutic approaches. These studies extend the theoretical basis that facilitates development of neuroprotective and repair-promoting therapeutic strategies.The application of novel and cutting-edge technologies in the fields of genomics and proteomics is providing a better understanding of the genetic and environmental factors involved in multiple sclerosis susceptibility and progression, as well as the detection of biomarkers for disease activity and response to therapy. Implementation of these facilitates identification of new targets for therapy towards tailoring treatment to the individual patient with multiple sclerosis.

The patient with RRMS now has severe, permanent neurologic damage and the other two patients died. In this article, we recommend revised entry and diagnostic criteria to prevent enrollment of RRMS patients with a favorable prognosis or questionable diagnosis into trials of drugs with unknown safety profiles. In light of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, we strongly recommend that RRMS patients who are at low risk of disability not be treated with natalizumab.

However, compelling evidence now exists that statins also have extensive immunomodulatory properties that operate independently of lipid lowering. Consequently, much attention has been directed towards their potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Modulation of post-translational protein prenylation seems to be a key mechanism by which statins alter immune function.

Orally administered cholesterol-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (known as statins), which exhibit immunomodulatory properties and are effective in treatment of the MS model EAE, are being tested in MS. As atorvastatin can enhance protective Th2 responses and has a different mechanism of action than glatiramer acetate (GA), a parenterally administered immunomodulatory agent approved for MS treatment, we tested whether the combination of these agents could be beneficial in EAE. Combination therapy using suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA prevented or reversed clinical and histologic EAE. was increased--in these mice, but not in mice treated with each drug alone at the same doses. Monocytes treated with the combination of suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA secreted an antiinflammatory type II cytokine pattern and, when used as APCs, promoted Th2 differentiation of naive myelin-specific T cells. Our results demonstrate that agents with different mechanisms of immune modulation can combine in a synergistic manner for the treatment of CNS autoimmunity and provide rationale for testing the combination of atorvastatin and GA in MS.

Thus, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of specific histamine receptors has been shown to reduce the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a prototypic Th1-mediated disease with similarities to human multiple sclerosis. To study the comprehensive contribution of endogenous histamine to the expression of EAE, we attempted to induce EAE in histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice, which are genetically unable to make histamine. In this study, we show that EAE is significantly more severe in HDC-/-, histamine-deficient mice, with diffuse inflammatory infiltrates, including a prevalent granulocytic component, in the brain and cerebellum. Unlike splenocytes from wild-type mice, splenocytes from HDC-/- mice do not produce histamine in response to the myelin Ag, whereas production of IFN-gamma, TNF, and leptin are increased in HDC-/- splenocytes in comparison to those from wild-type mice. Endogenous histamine thus appears to regulate importantly the autoimmune response against myelin and the expression of EAE, in this model, and to limit immune damage to the CNS. Understanding which receptor(s) for histamine is/are involved in regulating autoimmunity against the CNS might help in the development of new strategies of treatment for EAE and multiple sclerosis.

We describe here a novel approach to counteract this undesired side effect of plasmid DNA used for vaccination in Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. In chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), combining a myelin cocktail plus IL-4-tolerizing DNA vaccine with a suppressive GpG oligodeoxynucleotide (GpG-ODN) induced a shift of the autoreactive T cell response toward a protective Th2 cytokine pattern. Myelin microarrays demonstrate that GpG-ODN further decreased anti-myelin autoantibody epitope spreading and shifted the autoreactive B cell response to a protective IgG1 isotype. Moreover, the addition of GpG-ODN to tolerizing DNA vaccination therapy effectively reduced overall mean disease severity in both the chronic relapsing EAE and chronic progressive EAE mouse models. In conclusion, suppressive GpG-ODN effectively counteracted the undesired CpG-induced inflammatory effect of a tolerizing DNA vaccine in a Th1-mediated autoimmune disease by skewing both the autoaggressive T cell and B cell responses toward a protective Th2 phenotype. These results demonstrate that suppressive GpG-ODN is a simple and highly effective novel therapeutic adjuvant that will boost the efficacy of Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines used for treating Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases.

While much has been learned in randomized, controlled clinical trials, we cannot simply extrapolate the outcomes of these initiatives and apply them to the care of a single patient. In the future, the application of pharmacogenetic techniques, proteomics, and microarray analysis will yield novel profiling information on individual patients that will substantially refine the specific therapeutic questions of relevance: (1) What is the best treatment for an individual patient? (2) Which patients require intensive therapeutic combination regimens to optimize control of the disease process? (3) What are the appropriate drug dosing targets for an individual patient? and (4) Which patients will be predisposed to the development of drug-related adverse events? Such data may provide a novel variable of drug responsiveness that will mandate its inclusion into the process of covariate analyses for clinical trials.

Although MS exacerbations and the emergence of disability constitute the more conspicuous aspects of the disease process, evidence has confirmed that most of the disease occurs on a constitutive and occult basis. Disease-modifying therapies appear to be modest in the magnitude of their treatment effects, particularly in the progressive stage of the disease. Therapeutic strategies currently used for MS primarily target the inflammatory cascade. Several potential mechanisms appear to be involved in the progression of MS. Characterizing these mechanisms will result in a better understanding of the various forms of the disorder and how to effectively treat its clinical manifestations. It is our objective within this 2-part series on progression in MS to offer both evidence-based observations and hypothesis-driven expert perspectives on what constitutes the cause of progression in MS. We have chosen areas of inquiry that appear to have been most productive in helping us to better conceptualize the landscape of what MS looks like pathologically, immunologically, neuroscientifically, radiographically, and genetically. We have attempted to advance hypotheses focused on a deeper understanding of what contributes to the progression of this illness and to illustrate new technical capabilities that are catalyzing novel research initiatives targeted at achieving a more complete understanding of progression in MS.

Knowledge about the details of this anomalous immune response has come mostly from studies in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this model, it has been possible to prevent and effectively treat established disease through several antigen-specific therapeutic strategies, which have included administration of whole myelin or myelin proteins by various routes, random copolymers consisting of the main major histocompatability complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) contact amino acid residues, altered peptide ligands of dominant myelin epitopes in which one or more residues are selectively substituted, and lately DNA vaccination encoding self-myelin antigens. However, there have been difficulties in making successful transitions from animal models to human clinical trials, due either to lack of efficacy or unforeseen complications. Despite these problems, antigen-specific therapies have retained their attraction for clinicians and scientists alike, and hopefully the upcoming generation of agents--including altered peptide ligands and DNA vaccines--will benefit from the increasing knowledge about this disease and surmount existing difficulties to make an impact in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

It has been shown that immunization with Nogo-A promotes recovery in animal models of spinal cord injury through induction of Ab production. In this report, studies were performed to characterize the immune response to Nogo-66 and to determine the role of Nogo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of EAE-susceptible mouse strains with peptides derived from Nogo-66 induced a CNS immune response with clinical and pathological similarities to EAE. The Nogo-66 peptides elicited strong T cell responses that were not cross-reactive to other encephalitogenic myelin Ags. Using a large scale spotted microarray containing proteins and peptides derived from a wide spectrum of myelin components, we demonstrated that Nogo-66 peptides also generated a specific Ab response that spreads to several other encephalitogenic myelin Ags following immunization. Nogo-66-specific T cell lines ameliorated established EAE, via Nogo-66-specific Th2 cells that entered the CNS. These results indicate that some T cell and B cell immune responses to Nogo-66 are associated with suppression of ongoing EAE, whereas other Nogo-66 epitopes can be encephalitogenic.

In the last few years the involvement of TGase in neurodegenerative diseases [NDS], including its role in aggregate formation, has been broadened to include Alzheimer's [AD] and Parkinson's Disease [PD]. It is clear that reduction of TGase activity is beneficial for prolonged survival in mouse models of NDS. The pathological progression of these diseases might reflect in part increases of TGase induced aggregates, or changes in other pathways influenced by increases in TGase activity. Neurodegeneration may be influenced by increased TGase activity affecting apoptosis, modulation of GTPase activity and signal transduction. This review will focus on the leading hypotheses in relation to both old and new experimental results.

It is now recognised that other T lymphocyte subclasses can initiate CNS demyelination. In addition, other cell types and molecules may play an important role in MS pathogenesis. There is overwhelming evidence that MS is a dynamic process, in which recurrent episodes of blood-brain barrier disruption and CNS inflammation play a crucial role in early disease stages, leading eventually to the largely irreversible changes of demyelination, gliosis and axonal degeneration. These observations may have important therapeutic implications. Within the last ten years, several medications have been approved for MS treatment. These agents, all of which are given parenterally, are only partially effective and are often associated with adverse effects and potential toxicities. The number and different types of medications used for MS are likely to increase in the near future, as several novel therapies are currently tested in clinical trials. 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, 'statins', are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are given orally, are safe and have biological effects independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties.

Increased diversity of autoantibody responses in acute EAE predicted a more severe clinical course. Chronic EAE was associated with previously undescribed extensive intra- and intermolecular epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Array analysis of autoantigens targeted in acute EAE was used to guide the choice of autoantigen cDNAs to be incorporated into expression plasmids so as to generate tolerizing vaccines. Tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding a greater number of array-determined myelin targets proved superior in treating established EAE and reduced epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses.

Several immunomodulatory properties of statins may account for their beneficial clinical effect: Statins decreased the migration of leukocytes into the central nervous system, inhibited MHC class II and costimulatory signals required for activation of proinflammatory T cells, induced a T(H)2 phenotype in T cells, and decreased the expression of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system, including nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor alpha. It was also demonstrated that statin use significantly reduced beta-amyloid secretion in the cerebrospinal fluid of experimental animals.

Despite an appreciation of the large number of pathways and pathological processes that are involved in these diseases, a few practical targets and several new strategies have emerged from these studies. This review focuses on multiple sclerosis and on the approaches that are being used to identify new targets that might be manipulated to control this disease.

It has been shown that shifting the immune response to this antigen from TH1 towards TH2, via the administration of GAD65 peptides to young NOD mice, can suppress the progression to overt T1DM. Accordingly, various protocols of \"peptide immunotherapy\" of T1DM are under investigation. However, in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), another autoimmune TH1 mediated disease that mimics human multiple sclerosis, anaphylactic shock can occur when the mice are challenged with certain myelin self peptides that initially were administered with adjuvant to induce the disease.Here we show that NOD mice, that spontaneously develop T1DM, can develop fatal anaphylactic reactions upon challenge with preparations of immunodominant GAD65 self peptides after immunization with these peptides to modify the development of T1DM.These findings document severe anaphylaxis to self peptide preparations used in an attempt to devise immunotherapy for a spontaneous autoimmune disease. Taken together with the findings in EAE, these results suggest that peptide therapies designed to induce a TH1 to TH2 shift carry a risk for the development of anaphylactic reactivity to the therapeutic peptides.

We now demonstrate that, in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), mediated by T helper 1 (Th1) T cells, histamine receptor 1 and 2 (H1R and H2R) are present on inflammatory cells in brain lesions. Th1 cells reactive to myelin proteolipid protein expressed more than Th2 cells. Pyrilamine, an H1R antagonist, blocked EAE, and the platelet activating factor receptor antagonist CV6209 reduced the severity of EAE. EAE severity was also decreased in mice with disruption of the genes encoding Ig Fc gamma RIII or both Fc gamma RI. Prostaglandin D synthase and tryptase transcripts were elevated in EAE brain. Taken together, these data reveal extensive involvement of elements of the immune response associated with allergy in autoimmune demyelination. The pathogenesis of demyelination must now be viewed as encompassing elements of both Th1 responses and \"allergic\" responses.

Nevertheless, to date, such advances have failed to reveal the etiology of or yield curative therapies for autoimmune disease. New approaches are needed. Proteomics, the large-scale study of expression and function of proteins that compose our tissues and mediate disease, represents a powerful and promising strategy. We developed protein and peptide arrays to profile autoantibody responses in autoimmune disease. Protein and peptide array analysis of autoimmune samples is revealing human and pathogen proteins involved in initiation and perpetuation of autoimmunity. Proteomic determination of autoantibody profiles can be utilized for diagnosis, prognostication, and guiding tolerizing therapy for autoimmune disease.

Atorvastatin (Lipitor) was tested in chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a CD4(+) Th1-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease model of multiple sclerosis. Here we show that oral atorvastatin prevented or reversed chronic and relapsing paralysis. Atorvastatin suppressed. Atorvastatin promoted differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells. In adoptive transfer, these Th2 cells protected recipient mice from EAE induction. Atorvastatin reduced CNS infiltration and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression. Treatment of microglia inhibited IFN-gamma-inducible transcription at multiple MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) promoters and suppressed class II of CD40, reversed effects on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and T cells. Atorvastatin treatment of either APC or T cells suppressed antigen-specific T-cell activation. Thus, atorvastatin has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects involving both APC and T-cell compartments. Statins may be beneficial for multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases.

Mitoxantrone is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of secondary progressive MS. Despite this progress, the agents presently available are only partially effective, are difficult to administer, and may have significant side effects. Several orally administered immunomodulatory agents are presently being evaluated for treatment of MS. One class of drugs, HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), is safe and well-tolerated and could become another mainstay of MS therapy.This article reviews the clinical evidence for approved MS therapies and discusses their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the clinical and laboratory data suggesting a potential role for statins in MS therapy are discussed.Although treatment with interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and mitoxantrone, the approved therapies, provide important treatment options for patients with relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS, the potential benefits of other medications, including statins, should be explored in controlled clinical trials.

The purpose of our study was to identify the underlying mechanism for the diminished disease activity. We found that during the period of late pregnancy there is protection against paralysis, during both the induction and effector phases of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We did not find any changes in the cytokine secretion profiles or the proliferative activity of autoreactive T cells from mice induced during late pregnancy compared with virgin controls. In mice mated after disease onset, the inflammatory histologic lesions did not clear, despite marked clinical improvement during pregnancy. We found evidence for a serum factor present in late pregnancy that suppresses T cell activation. In the presence of sera taken from mice late in pregnancy, the proliferative response and IL-2 production of proteolipid protein p139-151-specific T cells were significantly diminished as compared with stimulation in the presence of normal mouse sera. In conclusion, serum from late pregnancy has the capacity to down-regulate T cell responses and might be associated with the amelioration of disease activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

The practice of innoculation with the fluid from a sore to protect from a disease actually dates back to ancient China; however, with the introduction of Jenner's smallpox vaccine, and greater understanding of the immune system, vaccines have become specific and systematic. Traditional vaccines have used killed pathogens (hepatitis A and the Salk polio vaccines), immunogenic subunits of a given pathogen (hepatitis attenuated pathogens (measles, mumps, rubella, Sabin polio vaccines) to generate protective immunity. Currently, a new generation of vaccines that use the genetic material of a pathogen to elicit protective immunity are being developed.

Comparison of two poles of MS pathology--acute lesions with inflammation versus 'silent' lesions without inflammation--revealed differentially transcribed genes. Some products of these genes were chosen as targets for therapy of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is upregulated in acute, but not in chronic, MS lesions, and the effect on ameliorating EAE is more pronounced in the acute phase, in contrast to knocking out the immunoglobulin Fc receptor common gamma chain where the effect is greatest on chronic disease. These results in EAE corroborate the microarray studies on MS lesions. Large-scale analysis of transcripts in MS lesions elucidates new aspects of pathology and opens possibilities for therapy.

Transglutaminase (TGase) may be critical in the pathogenesis, via cross-linking huntingtin. Administration of the TGase competitive inhibitor, cystamine, to transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of huntingtin containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat, altered the course of their HD-like disease. Cystamine given intraperitoneally entered brain where it inhibited TGase activity. When treatment began after the appearance of abnormal movements, cystamine extended survival, reduced associated tremor and abnormal movements and ameliorated weight loss. Treatment did not influence the appearance or frequency of neuronal nuclear inclusions. Unexpectedly, cystamine treatment increased transcription of one of the two genes shown to be neuroprotective for polyglutamine toxicity in Drosophila, dnaj (also known as HDJ1 and Hsp40 in humans and mice, respectively).

Microarray analysis of spinal cords from rats paralyzed by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, also revealed increased OPN transcripts. Osteopontin-deficient mice were resistant to progressive EAE and had frequent remissions, and myelin-reactive T cells in OPN-/- mice produced more interleukin 10 and less interferon-gamma than in OPN+/+ mice. Osteopontin thus appears to regulate T helper cell-1 (TH1)-mediated demyelinating disease, and it may offer a potential target in blocking development of progressive MS.

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas. The NOD mouse is an animal model of IDDM in which several autoantigens, including insulin, have been identified. In this study we demonstrate that vaccination of NOD mice with DNA encoding an immunodominant peptide of insulin (residues 9-23 of the B chain) protects the animals from developing diabetes. Animals injected intramuscularly with a bacterial plasmid encoding the insulin B chain peptide show significantly lower disease incidence and delayed onset of disease when compared to controls. Protection appears to be mediated by insulin B (9-23)-specific down-regulation of IFN-gamma. Our results confirm that DNA vaccination has a protective effect on autoimmunity, the understanding of which will reveal new insights into the immune system and open doors for novel therapies.

We recently reported that passive transfer of autoimmune T cells directed against myelin-associated antigens provides acutely damaged spinal cords with effective neuroprotection. The therapeutic time window for the passive transfer of T cells was found to be at least 1 week. Here we show that posttraumatic T cell-based active vaccination is also neuroprotective. Immunization with myelin-associated antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) significantly promoted recovery after spinal cord contusion injury in the rat model. To reduce the risk of autoimmune disease while retaining the benefit of the immunization, we vaccinated the rats immediately after severe incomplete spinal cord injury with MBP-derived altered peptide ligands. Immunization with these peptides resulted in significant protection from neuronal loss and thus in a reduced extent of paralysis, assessed by an open-field behavioral test. Retrograde labeling of the rubrospinal tracts and magnetic resonance imaging supported the behavioral results. Further optimization of nonpathogenic myelin-derived peptides can be expected to lead the way to the development of an effective therapeutic vaccination protocol as a strategy for the prevention of total paralysis after incomplete spinal cord injury.

We provide evidence for a mechanism whereby IL-4 expressed from the naked DNA is secreted and acts locally on autoreactive T cells via activation of STAT6 to shift their cytokine profile to T helper 2. We also show that DNA vaccines can be used to reverse established EAE by covaccination with the genes for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and IL-4. This treatment strategy combines the antigen-specific effects of DNA vaccination and the beneficial effects of local gene delivery.

Although EAE is classically a prototypic T helper 1 (TH1) cell-mediated autoimmune disease, it can also be induced by TH2 cells. Characteristically, the most severe manifestation of allergy, anaphylaxis, is associated with exposure to a foreign antigen that is often derived from medication, insect venom or food. We report here that, after self-tolerance to myelin is destroyed, anaphylaxis may be triggered by a self-antigen, in this case a myelin peptide. \"Horror autotoxicus\", which was initially described by Ehrlich, may not only include autoimmunity to self, it may also encompass immediate hypersensitivity to self, which leads to shock and rapid death.

We have recently reported some success with altered peptide ligands for a major target of the autoimmune response in MS. Antigen specific therapy has the potential to suppress undesirable autoimmunity, while leaving the rest of the immune system intact. Induction of an antigen specific Th1-to-Th2 shift could achieve this aim, once side effects, such as allergic responses, are minimized with optimal dosing.

In the specific case of HIV-1, this subunit is the basic domain Tat(49-57) (RKKRRQRRR). To establish the optimal structural requirements for this translocation process, and thereby to develop improved molecular transporters that could deliver agents into cells, a series of analogues of Tat(49-57) were prepared and their cellular uptake into Jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. All truncated and alanine-substituted analogues exhibited diminished cellular uptake, suggesting that the cationic residues of Tat(49-57) play a principal role in its uptake. Charge alone, however, is insufficient for transport as oligomers of several cationic amino acids (histidine, lysine, and ornithine) are less effective than Tat(49-57) in cellular uptake. In contrast, a 9-mer of l-arginine (R9) was 20-fold more efficient than Tat(49-57) at cellular uptake as determined by Michaelis-Menton kinetic analysis. The d-arginine oligomer (r9) exhibited an even greater uptake rate enhancement (>100-fold). Collectively, these studies suggest that the guanidinium groups of Tat(49-57) play a greater role in facilitating cellular uptake than either charge or backbone structure. Based on this analysis, we designed and synthesized a class of polyguanidine peptoid derivatives. Remarkably, the subset of peptoid analogues containing a six-methylene spacer between the guanidine head group and backbone (N-hxg), exhibited significantly enhanced cellular uptake compared to Tat(49-57) and even to r9. Overall, a transporter has been developed that is superior to Tat(49-57), protease resistant, and more readily and economically prepared.

To investigate whether the polycationic character of these molecules, or some other structural feature, was the molecular basis for the effect, the ability of a variety of homopolymers to enter cells was assayed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Polymers of L- or D-arginine containing six or more amino acids entered cells far more effectively than polymers of equal length composed of lysine, ornithine and histidine. Peptides of fewer than six amino acids were ineffective. The length of the arginine side-chain could be varied without significant loss of activity. These data combined with the inability of polymers of citrulline to enter cells demonstrated that the guanidine headgroup of arginine was the critical structural component responsible for the biological activity. Cellular uptake could be inhibited by preincubation of the cells with sodium azide, but not by low temperature (3 degrees C), indicating that the process was energy dependent, but did not involve endocytosis.

There were no increases in either clinical relapses or in new enhancing lesions in any patient, even those with hypersensitivity reactions. Secondary analysis of those patients completing the study showed that the volume and number of enhancing lesions were reduced at a dose of 5 mg.

Antibody-conjugated paramagnetic liposomes (ACPLs) were designed to achieve in vivo targeting of molecules expressed on vascular endothelium, while providing sufficient signal enhancement at these sites for detection by MRI. ACPLs targeted to intercellular adhesion upregulated on during EAE, were administered to diseased mice. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that fluorescently-tagged ACPLs were localized to central nervous system (CNS) microvasculature in a pattern consistent with ICAM-1 upregulation described immunohistochemically. High resolution MRI of mouse brains ex vivo demonstrated that ACPL binding conferred significant enhancement of signal intensity (SI) as compared to control images. These results suggest that ACPLs can be used as MRI contrast agents to visualize specific molecules expressed on vascular endothelium during disease.

Here, using DNA microarrays, we show gene expression patterns in an apoptosis-sensitive and apoptosis-resistant murine B cell lymphoma model system both before and after irradiation. From the 11,000 genes interrogated by the arrays, two major patterns emerged. First, before radiation exposure the radioresistant LYar cells expressed significantly greater levels of message for several genes involved in regulating intracellular redox potential. Compared with LYas cells, LYar cells to 50-fold more mRNA for the tetraspanin CD53 and for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Expression of both of these genes can lead to the increase of total cellular glutathione, which is the principle intracellular antioxidant and has been shown to inhibit many forms of apoptosis. A second pattern emerged after radiation, when the apoptosis-sensitive LYas cells induced rapid expression of a unique cluster of genes characterized by their involvement in mitochondrial electron transport. Some of these genes have been previously recognized as proapoptotic; however others, such as uncoupling protein 2, were not previously known to be apoptotic regulatory proteins. From these observations we propose that a multigenic program for sensitivity to apoptosis involves induction of transcripts for genes participating in mitochondrial uncoupling and loss of membrane potential. This program triggers mitochondrial release of apoptogenic factors and induces the \"caspase cascade.\" Conversely, cells resistant to apoptosis down-regulate these biochemical pathways, while activating pathways for establishment and maintenance of high intracellular redox potential by means of elevated glutathione.

Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the presence of inflammatory infiltrates within ALS spinal cord and suggested the possibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron degeneration. We have analyzed the diversity of T-cells in the spinal cord in ALS. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with variable (V) region sequence specific oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify T-cell receptor (TCR)BV transcripts from spinal cords obtained at autopsy from patients with ALS, patients who died without inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, brains from patients with ALS, and brains from patients who died with inflammatory CNS disease. Sequencing was then performed on the amplified transcripts. An overall increase in the level of TCRBV 2 transcripts was detected in ALS specimens when compared to controls. This result was independent of the HLA genotype of the individual. Furthermore, enrichment of TCRBV2-positive T cells could be demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid derived from patients with ALS, using PCR analysis and a T cell stimulation assay with toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), a Vbeta2-specific superantigen. Our results suggest that an immunological process involving the specific expansion of Vbeta2 TCR-positive T-cells may be important in the pathogenesis of ALS.

Transglutaminase (TGase) crosslinked these proteins, and the aggregations did not have the staining properties of amyloid. More TGase-catalyzed aggregates formed when the polyglutamine domain of htt exceeded the pathologic threshold of polyQ36. Furthermore, shorter htt constructs, containing 135 aa or fewer, formed more aggregates than did larger htt constructs. TGase activity in the HD brain was increased compared with the control, with notable increases in cell nuclei. The increased TGase activity was brain specific. In lymphoblastoid cells from HD patients, TGase activity was decreased.

Activated T cell lines and clones expressed CD44 and integrin alpha4, but not L-selectin, and entered the CNS independent of their antigen specificity. mAbs directed against CD44 and integrin alpha4 prevented the transfer of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by myelin basic protein-specific T cells. T cells preincubated with anti-CD44 or antiintegrin alpha4 were blocked only partially from entering the brain parenchyma. However, both antibodies efficiently prevented CNS inflammation and clinical expression of EAE when injected in vivo. This effect lasted as long as antibodies were administered. Antibodies specific for L-selectin had no effect on homing of encephalitogenic T cells to the brain or development of EAE. Antiintegrin alpha4 and anti-CD44 did not impair the activation and function of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro and did not deplete integrin alpha4- or CD44-positive cells in vivo. These data suggest that, in the absence of leukocyte recruitment, the entry of a reduced number of activated myelin basic protein-reactive T cells in the CNS is not sufficient for the development and expression of EAE. We propose that antibodies to integrin alpha4 and CD44 prevent clinical disease by partially targeting the primary influx of encephalitogenic T cells and by preventing the secondary influx of leukocytes to lesions initiated by the transferred T cells.

VHFFK contains the major residues for binding of this self-molecule to T cell receptor (TCR) and to the major histocompatibility complex. Peptides from papilloma virus strains containing the motif VHFFK induce EAE.

This vaccination attenuates a prototypic autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which presents clinically with paralysis.

In the brains of mice that were successfully vaccinated, mRNA for IL-2, IL-15, and IFN-gamma were reduced. A mechanism underlying the reduction in severity and incidence of paralytic autoimmune disease and the reduction in Th1 cytokines involves altered costimulation of T cells; loading of APCs with DNA encoding PLP139-151 reduced the capacity of a T cell line reactive to PLP139-151 to proliferate even in the presence of exogenous CD28 costimulation.

The immunized mice produced IgG antibodies to p53 and mounted a cytotoxic reaction to a tumor line bearing mutated p53. The idiotypically immunized mice were resistant to challenge with the tumor cells. Thus antibodies to p53 might serve as immunogens for activating resistance to some tumors. At the basic level, these findings indicate that a network of p53 immunity may be organized naturally within the immune system.

We designed truncated peptides based on this pathogenic 13-mer that are not antigenic. These short peptides reduced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in vivo. Moreover, paraplegic rats given the 7-mer FKNIVTP in soluble form showed total reversal of paralysis in 24 h. Truncated peptides that are too small to stimulate antigenic responses to pathogenic regions of myelin basic protein are nevertheless effective tolerogens and are able to anergize autoreactive T cells. Short peptide-based tolerogens, devoid of immunogenic and pathogenic potential, may be attractive for therapy of autoimmune diseases.

A model will be proposed that includes the initial activation of naive T lymphocytes through T cell receptor-mediated recognition of microbial antigens presented by MHC class II molecules. This event might be followed by re-activation of autoreactive T cells by bacterial and viral superantigens. Both mechanisms could lead to acute and relapsing autoimmune disease.

We have found that the beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion of resting human T cells to fibronectin, a major glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix, is induced by physiologic concentrations of three neuropeptides: calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP), neuropeptide Y, and somatostatin; each acts via its own specific receptor on the T cell membrane. In contrast, substance P (SP), which coexists with CGRP in the majority of peripheral endings of sensory nerves, including those innervating the lymphoid organs, blocks T cell adhesion to fibronectin when induced by CGRP, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, inflammatory protein-1beta, and PMA. Inhibition of T cell adhesion was obtained both by the intact SP peptide and by its 1-4 N-terminal and its 4-11, 5-11, and 6-11 C-terminal fragments, used at similar nanomolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the parent SP peptide and its fragments were abrogated by an SP NK-1 receptor antagonist, suggesting they all act through the same SP NK-1 receptor. These findings suggest that neuropeptides, by activating their specific T cell-expressed receptors, can provide the T cells with both positive (proadhesive) and negative (antiadhesive) signals and thereby regulate their function. Thus, neuropeptides may influence diverse physiologic processes involving integrins, including leukocyte-mediated migration and inflammation.

The structural requirements for autoantibody recognition were compared to those previously defined for MBP-specific T cell clones. MBP autoantibodies were affinity-purified from central nervous system lesions of 11/12 postmortem cases studied. The MBP(83-97) peptide was immunodominant in all 11 cases since it inhibited autoantibody binding to MBP > 95%. Residues contributing to autoantibody binding were located in a 10-amino acid segment (V86-T95) that also contained the MHC/T cell receptor contact residues of the T cell epitope. In the epitope center, the same residues were important for antibody binding and T cell recognition. Based on the antibody-binding motif, microbial peptides were identified that were bound by purified autoantibodies. Autoantibody binding of microbial peptides required sequence identity at four or five contiguous residues in the epitope center. Microbial peptides previously found to activate T cell clones did not have such obvious homology to MBP since sequence identity was not required at MHC contacts. The similar fine specificity of B cells and T cells may be useful for tolerance induction to MBP in MS.

The pathogenesis of MS is complex and probably involves soluble immune mediators, particularly cytokines, and activated memory T cells, that are thought to migrate into the CNS. During lesion formation in MS, cytokines regulate cell functions, such as cell recruitment and migration. Because the chemokine RANTES play a role in both activating and recruiting leucocytes, particularly memory T cells into inflammatory sites, the authors have assessed RANTES mRNA levels at the site of lesions. Expression levels were analysed in brain samples and compared with neurological, infectious and other controls. RANTES was expressed by activated perivascular memory T cells, predominantly located at the edge of active plaques. While RANTES mRNA was detected in all 17 MS brains analysed, it was only found in six of the 14 control patients and generally at a lower expression level. In view of the regulatory and chemotactic properties of RANTES, these results imply that RANTES in MS lesions may play an important role in the activation and/or selective accumulation of memory T cells and, thereby, in the pathogenic events associated with MS.

Suppression of paralysis with CRF involved stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and inhibitory effects on an encephalitogenic T cell line. While CRF increased glucocorticoid production, which is known to block EAE, it also suppressed EAE in adrenalectomized rats, where glucocorticoid stimulation via CRF plays no role. Moreover, the encephalitogenicity of a T cell line exposed to CRF in vitro was reduced.

The clinical course of actively induced EAE was compared in IL-4+/+, IL-4+ /- and IL-4-/- mice on the PL/J genetic background. No significant differences were noted between groups for the frequency, severity and duration of EAE, and the frequency of relapses. Our results indicate that IL-4, despite its well-documented regulatory role in EAE, is not necessary for the spontaneous remission of disease or for the prevention of relapses. Therefore, in the absence of IL-4, overlapping or compensatory immunoregulatory mechanisms can restrict an inflammatory response within the central nervous system.

The targets of recognition in T-T cell interactions are not clear. Most recent experimental work has focused on the idiotypic regulatory interactions mediated by TCR peptides. There is experimental evidence that regulatory cells exist that do not recognize the TCR. This type of regulation is selectively induced by activated T cells. Therefore, we designed this study to examine the possible role of cytokine receptors as targets of immune regulation. We tested two peptides of IL-2R alpha-chain, 2 of IL-2R beta-chain, and one of TNFR (p60). All peptides were found to be immunogenic at inducing T cell proliferation and four induced Abs in Lewis rats. We generated T cell lines to these five peptides, and tested them both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the T cells exhibited a proliferative response when cultured with activated, irradiated stimulator cells that were augmented upon addition of the cytokine receptor peptide. The cytokine profile of the lines was characterized as well as the Vbeta gene composition. One of the lines significantly protected against active encephalomyelitis.

Once triggered, the immune system attacks and destroys myelin and the myelin forming cell. Evidence is presented that the oligodendrocyte responds to the attack by immune cells and their secreted products through modulation of its metabolism and gene expression. Cytokines, immunoglobulins, and complement complexes may elicit a survival response in the oligodendrocytes, involving the induction of heat shock proteins and other protective molecules.

We examined a group of patients with multiple sclerosis, a disease caused by excess production of Th1 cytokines in myelin-reactive T cells, and control patients with noninflammatory neuroconvulsive disorders, for the presence of allergic disease, which is caused by excess production of Th2 cytokines in allergen-specific T cells. The patients with multiple sclerosis had significantly fewer allergic symptoms, a lower number of positive allergen-specific IgE test results, and lower composite allergy indexes than control subjects. These results demonstrate that the prevalence of IgE-mediated allergic disease is decreased in a group of patients with multiple sclerosis and support the hypothesis that genetic factors that promote susceptibility to Th1-mediated inflammatory disease in human beings protect against the development of Th2-mediated disease.

We show here that when clone L10C1 is tolerized in vivo with an analogue of p87-99, established paralysis is reversed, inflammatory infiltrates regress, and the heterogeneous T-cell infiltrate disappears from the brain, with only the T-cell clones that incited disease remaining in the original lesions. We found that antibody raised against interleukin-4 reversed the tolerance induced by the altered peptide ligand. Treatment with this altered peptide ligand selectively silences pathogenic T cells and actively signals for the efflux of other T cells recruited to the site of disease as a result of the production of interleukin-4 and the reduction of tumour-necrosis factor-alpha in the lesion.

IFN-gamma, a cytokine produced by a variety of cells, is involved in many inflammatory and immune regulatory events. Contradictory results concerning exacerbations and the disease course were seen comparing injections of IFN-gamma in humans suffering from multiple sclerosis to studies using anti-IFN-gamma Abs in mice with EAE. To study the role of IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-producing cells in EAE, we crossed IFN-gamma knockout mice (H-2b) (unable to produce IFN-gamma due to the disruption of the IFN-gamma gene) with an EAE-susceptible mouse strain, B10.PL (H-2u). EAE was seen in IFN-gamma knockout mice, heterozygotic (IFN-gamma +/-) mice, as well as wild-type littermates following immunization with MBP. Histologic analyses of the central nervous system of IFN-gamma knockout mice with EAE revealed massive infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. We conclude that the presence of IFN-gamma is not crucial to the induction or the clinical course of EAE.

Phenotypic analysis was performed using flow cytometry, assignment of donor/host lineage by cytogenetics or HLA-specific flow cytometry, and analysis of the T cell receptor (TCR) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We have previously reported the initial appearance in the blood of AR patients of host CD8+brightCD3low T cells that progressively express increasing amounts of CD3+ cells. We now report that this cell population can differentiate into either a cytotoxic T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+CD57-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched unrelated donors or a suppressor T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+CD57+HLA-DR-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched sibling donors. Analysis of the TCR V beta subsets from two patients revealed sorted host CD3+CD8+ cells (purity 90-95%) from the first patient to express V beta 18 almost exclusively. In a second patient with late rejection (55 days post-BMT), the CD3+CD8+ cells were predominantly restricted to V beta 1, 5.1, 7, 9, and 18. Although CD3+CD8+ T cells are known to be associated with AR, cytotoxic and suppressor lineages in AR from the same type of BMT and clonal distribution of T cells in AR have not been reported. Preliminary results suggest that V beta expression in AR of PMRD grafts is restricted and host T cell phenotype may vary. Further studies will investigate whether specific mismatches correlate with specific V beta usage and/or host T cell phenotype.

This study demonstrates that the proteins secreted by Y. enterocolitica, including a protein with tyrosine phosphatase activity (YopH), are potent immunogens stimulating CD4+ cells within the inflamed joint. The pathogen-reactive T cell clones preferentially utilized a limited set of T cell receptor variable region gene segments. A purified Yersinia superantigen triggered a proliferative response in most of the antigen-reactive T cell clones tested.

Their effect was examined at the clinical and histopathological level. Levels of administered antibody and IL-6 bioactivity were followed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Systemically administered antibodies penetrated into the fluid CSF in animals in which EAE was induced. Administration of anti-IL-6 reduced the development of actively induced as well as adoptively transferred EAE and was associated with increased levels of IL-6 activity in the CSF and to a lesser extent in the serum. Anti-IL-6 was still effective when given 1 day before the onset of disease signs in adoptively transferred EAE. The disease-reducing effect of anti-IL-6 was also reflected at the pathological level by the absence of inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS.Our study indicates that IL-6 plays an important role in autoimmune CNS inflammation. However, due to the complex nature of the in vivo interactions of administered antibodies, the disease-reducing effect of the anti-IL-6 antibodies could be caused by neutralization of IL-6 activity or by enhancement of IL-6 activity via induction of higher IL-6 levels in the CNS.

In rodent models of MS, immunization to this component of MBP evokes experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). T cells found in EAE lesions show similarities in the VJ and VDJ regions of their alpha and beta chains with T cells in MS lesions, and with T cells that are specific for MBPp84-103 isolated from patients with MS.

We demonstrate that SJL mice remain susceptible to disease after recovery, and suffer a second episode of disease when reinjected with spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant. Reinduced disease occurs earlier after injection than the initial disease (mean onset 7.3 days compared with 14.5 days), and has comparable severity and incidence. The susceptibility to reinduced disease is present for at least 20 weeks after the initial injection. If the initial episode of EAE is elicited using a synthetic peptide of proteolipid protein, then reinjection of the same peptide causes reinduced disease. PL/J mice and PL/J x SJL F1 mice are also susceptible to reinduced disease which occurs with an accelerated onset and higher incidence than the initial disease. We conclude that SJL and PL/J mice have a defect in immunoregulation which causes them to be susceptible to recurrent episodes of autoimmune disease.

Antigen-specific responses by CSF lymphocytes were seen early in the course of this disease as well as several years after patients had entered remission. When compared to CSF cells, the response of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells was similar but of a much smaller magnitude and at times undetectable. Fluorescence activated cell sorting revealed an increased percentage of CD3+ (T-cells), CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD3+/HLA-DR+ (activated T-cell) cells in the CSF of C. immitis meningitis patients compared to their blood. Most of the antigen-specific proliferative response resided in the CD4+ lymphocyte subset. CSF T-cell proliferation assays may have a role in the diagnosis of C. immitis meningitis.

Treatment of neonatal mice with either anti-L-selectin or anti-integrin alpha 4 monoclonal antibodies for the first 4 weeks of life led to a significant and long-term protection against spontaneous occurrence of insulitis and diabetes. The same treatment failed to inhibit lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands (sialadenitis). This tissue-specific inhibition of inflammation may be attributed to differences between the pancreas and salivary gland in their expression of endothelial ligands for cell 1 cell adhesion molecule 1). Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 is highly expressed by vessels within the inflamed islets but was not detected in the salivary glands. In contrast, peripheral vascular addressin- and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1-expressing vessels can be found in almost every area of inflammation within the salivary glands but are seen in only 40-50% of inflamed islets. Anti-L-selectin and anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment had no demonstrable effect on anti-beta-cell autoimmunity or on the immune responses to foreign antigens. Therapeutic treatment with anti-L-selectin after the onset of insulitis from 10 to 14 weeks of age delayed the onset but failed to prevent spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, whereas anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment resulted in a significant and long-lasting suppression of the disease.

We analyzed the trimolecular interactions between MBP p87-99, class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and TCR, and designed soluble inhibitors for therapy. F, N, I, and V at positions 90, 92, 93, and 94 interact with MHC, whereas K, T, and P at positions 91, 95, and 96 interact with TCR. The peptides, p87-99[95T > A] and p87-99[96P > A] could compete more effectively with p87-99 for binding to MHC and could antagonize the in vitro response to T cells to p87-99 more effectively than p87-99[91K > A]. However, only p87-99[91K > A] prevented and reversed EAE, indicating that the extent of MHC or TCR competition does not predict success in treating EAE. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of EAE, draining lymph node cells from rats immunized with the native peptide alone or together with each of the three TCR antagonists were challenged in vitro with p87-99. Administration of p87-99[91K > A], but not p87-99 [95T > A] or p87-99[96P > A], reduced the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha and interferon (IFN) gamma.

We used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model to evaluate the effect of a hydroxamate matrix metalloprotease inhibitor (GM 6001) on inflammatory demyelination. A single dose of the inhibitor, given intraperitoneally, provided sufficient levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of animals with EAE to induce at least a partial inhibition of the gelatinase activity in the cerebrospinal fluid. When administered daily either from the time of disease induction or from the onset of clinical signs, GM 6001 suppressed the development or reversed clinical EAE in a dose-dependent way, respectively. Animals returned to the same clinical course as the nontreated group after cessation of treatment. Animals treated from the onset of clinical signs had normal permeability of the blood-brain barrier, compared with the enhanced permeability in nontreated animals. These results indicate that matrix metalloprotease inhibition can reverse ongoing EAE. This effect appears to be mediated mainly through restoration of the damaged blood-brain barrier in the inflammatory phase of the disease, since, the degree of demyelination and inflammation did not differ between the treatment groups.

Five HPRT mutant clones that recognized myelin basic protein and myelin basic protein peptides along with three clones that responded to myelin basic protein peptide alone were isolated.

This antibody caused a prompt and long-lasting depletion of circulating CD4 (helper/inducer) lymphocytes. The mean (+/- SE) CD4 count for the group decreased from 870 (+/- 66) cells/mm3 at baseline to 76 (+/- 11) 3 hours after treatment, and then increased to 425 (+/- 38) at 1 month after treatment and 475 (+/- 39) at 6 months after treatment. Numbers of CD8 (cytotoxic/suppressor) lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes changed transiently but showed no significant long-term effects. The most common side effects were headache, nausea, myalgia, fever, and tachycardia occurring in the first few hours after treatment. No serious or unexpected infections or other significant adverse effects occurred. Kurtzke EDSS scores remained stable, and MRI scans showed less contrast enhancement 1 week after treatment. We conclude that treatment of MS patients with cM-T412 chimeric anti-CD4 antibody is well tolerated at the doses tested and produces a long-lasting, selective depletion of CD4 lymphocytes.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) susceptibility alleles, the target peptides, and T cells with anti-self reactivity must be present to cause autoimmune diseases. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a murine model of a human autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. In EAE, residues 1-11 of myelin basic protein (MBP) are the dominant disease-inducing determinants in PL/J and (PL/J x SJL/J)F1 mice. Here we report that a six-residue peptide (five of them native) of MBP can induce EAE. Using peptide analogues of the MBP-(1-11) peptide, we demonstrate that only four native MBP residues are required to stimulate MBP-specific T cells. Therefore, this study demonstrates lower minimum structural requirements for effective antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules. Many viral and bacterial proteins share short runs of amino acid similarity with host self proteins, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry. Since a six-residue peptide can sensitize MBP-specific T cells to cause EAE, these results define a minimum sequence identity for molecular mimicry in autoimmunity.

It has been suggested that leukocyte adhesion to endothelium is a sequential multistep process involving various different homing receptors. We report here that blocking different homing receptors--namely, L-selectin and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4)--which function during different stages of the adhesion process, by specific monoclonal antibodies inhibits insulitis and prevents diabetes in mice. Moreover, leukocyte attachment to the inflamed vessels within pancreatic sections could be inhibited by anti-L-selectin and anti-VLA-4 antibodies. Interestingly, anti-L-selectin or anti-VLA-4 antibody did not appear to influence the autoimmune response to a panel of pancreatic beta-cell autoantigens. These data suggest that L-selectin and VLA-4 are involved in mediating leukocyte homing to the islets and that intervention of these two adhesion pathways may provide a novel approach for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

CD4 and CD8 were not quantifiable at baseline, became detectable at 5 days after immunization, and increased steadily to a peak during clinical disease. I-A increased after CD4 and CD8, but before onset of disease. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 did not increase until after onset of clinical disease. CD4, CD8, and I-A remained elevated long after recovery from disease. These results suggest that infiltration of CD4 and CD8 cells into the spinal cord and subsequent upregulation of I-A mRNA play an important role in the development of EAE, but reversal of these processes is not necessary for recovery. Upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA does not appear to be important for development of disease.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) serves as a model for multiple sclerosis, with episodes of relapsing paralysis. In certain strains of mice, T-lymphocytes expressing the V beta 8 T-cell receptor (TCR) engage the amino-terminal epitope Ac1-11 of myelin basic protein, leading superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activates V beta 8-expressing T cells. Here we show that after immunization with Ac1-11, or after transfer of encephalitogenic T-cell lines or clones to Ac1-11, SEB induces exacerbation or relapses of paralytic disease in mice that are in clinical remission following an initial episode of paralysis, and triggers paralysis in mice with subclinical disease. Tumour necrosis factor has a critical role in the mechanism underlying SEB-induced exacerbation of disease, because anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody given in vivo delays the onset of paralysis triggered by SEB. On reactivation of autoaggressive cells through their T-cell receptor, superantigens may induce clinical relapses of autoimmune disease.

The results of this study, obtained from semiquantitative PCR analyses, showed that in all patients most of the TCR V alpha- and V beta-gene segments could be detected both in fresh PBMCs and in fresh SFMCs. The relative frequencies of use of these V-region genes were variable between the different patients. Although there was some skewing of increased usage frequencies of particular TCR V alpha and V beta genes among SFMC-derived TCRs when compared with PBMCs, we could not correlate such increased TCR V-gene usage with the inflammation in the joints as a disease-specific marker.

Recently we have used the PCR method to analyse rearrangements of V alpha and V beta genes of the T cell receptor (TCR) in samples of MS and control brains. The results of these studies showed that TCR V gene usage in MS brains may be restricted and in particular that V beta genes may be preferentially rearranged in certain HLA haplotypes associated with susceptibility to MS. In view of the recent evidence that T lymphocytes bearing the gamma delta chains may have autoreactive potential, we have assessed whether or not such TCR-bearing lymphocytes were also present in chronic MS lesions. TCR V gamma and V delta were analysed by the PCR method using a panel of V gamma and V delta primers paired with C gamma or C delta primers in 12 MS brains, as well as in brain samples of ten normal post-mortem cases and three neurological controls. TCR V gamma-C gamma and V delta-C delta rearrangements were confirmed using Southern blotting and hybridisation of the PCR products with specific C gamma and C delta probes. Only one to four rearranged TCR V gamma and V delta transcripts were detected in each of the 23 brain samples obtained from 12 MS patients, with the majority of gamma delta T cells expressing the V gamma 2 and V delta 2 chains. In marked contrast, V gamma and V delta transcripts could only be found in one of the ten non-neurological control brains analysed. To assess the clonality of V gamma 2 and V delta 2 T cell receptor chains in the brain samples of MS patients, we have sequenced the junctional regions of the TCR V gamma-N-J gamma-C gamma and V delta-N-D delta-N-J delta-C delta segments amplified from brain tissues, CSF and spleens of two MS patients and from the spleen of two control subjects. The sequence analysis obtained so far shows no compelling evidence of an MS specific expansion of one or more clones expressing particular types of gamma delta T cell receptors. In contrast, a clonal expansion of a different population of TCR gamma delta-bearing T cells was found in the spleen of both an MS patient and one of the control individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for [Web of Science ID A1993LZ48700028](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/A1993LZ48700028) View details for [PubMedID 8395544](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8395544) To study in vivo activated cytolytic T cells, CD8+ T cells clones were isolated from a melanoma patient (HLA A2, A11) treated with active specific immunotherapy for 5 years. CD8+ T lymphocytes, purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, were cloned directly from the peripheral blood without antigen-presenting cells in the presence of irradiated autologous melanoma cells and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4. These conditions were inhibitory to de novo in vitro immunization. Of the 28 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones, 21 lysed the autologous melanoma cell line (M7) but not the autologous lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL-7) nor the two melanoma cell line, M1 (HLA A28) and M2 (HLA A28, A31), used to immunize the patient. The remaining 7 clones were also melanoma-specific, although their reactivities were broader, lysing several melanoma cell lines but not HLA-matched lymphoblastoid cells. Eight clones from the first group, ostensibly self-MHC-restricted, were expanded for further analysis. All expressed cluster determinants characteristic of mature, activated T cells, but not those of thymocytes, naive T cells, B cells or natural killer (NK) cells. They also expressed CD13, a myeloid marker. Of the 8 clones, 3 expressed both CD4 and CD8, but dual expression was not correlated with specificity of lysis. Two CD8+ and 2 CD4+ CD8+ clones were specific for the autologous melanoma cells, the other 4 were also reactive against other HLA-A2-positive melanomas. Cytotoxicity for both singly and doubly positive clones was restricted by HLA class I but not class II antigens. Analysis of the RNA expression of the T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta gene segments revealed heterogeneous usage by the A2-restricted clones and, perhaps, also by the broadly melanoma-specific clones. Apparent TCR-restricted usage was noted for the self-MHC-restricted clones; 2 of the 4 expressed the V alpha 17/V beta 7 dimer. Since the T cell clones were derived from separate precursors of circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), the V alpha 17/V beta 7 TCR was well represented in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of this patient. In summary, we show that melanoma cells presented their own antigens to stimulate the proliferation of melanoma-reactive CD8+ CTL. CTL with a range of melanoma specificities and different TCR alpha beta dimers were encountered in this patient, perhaps as a result of hyperimmunization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for [Web of Science ID A1993LD75300003](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/A1993LD75300003) View details for [PubMedID 8513449](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8513449) View details for [PubMedID 8363260](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8363260) View details for [Web of Science ID A1993LM12300043](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/A1993LM12300043) View details for [PubMedID 8357179](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8357179) Improved molecular methods allow identification of the specific autoaggressive T cells involved in autoimmune inflammations. In this study of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein-induced uveitis, TCR V beta usage was studied using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of transcripts derived directly from ocular tissues and from T cell lines obtained from the spleen. Specific V beta 5' primers from the major murine TCR V beta families were coupled with a common 3' primer from the V beta C region. Amplification of rearranged TCR V beta-D beta-J beta-C beta sequences was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. In ocular tissue from sensitized mice, TCR V beta expression was limited mainly to one to three V beta families, with predominant expression of V beta 2, V beta 12, and V beta 15. In most animals there was similar, albeit limited, TCR gene usage in both the recognition of autoantigen in uveitogenic T cell lines and at the site of inflammation in the eye. Identification of a limited TCR V beta repertoire in Ag-reactive T cell lines correlated with TCR usage at the target site of autoimmune expression. The gene products of the restricted TCR V beta rearrangements found in lesions and in the cell lines may serve as the target for selective immunotherapy.

The spirochetal Ag recognized by 16 of these T cell clones was determined by reactivity with a panel of recombinant spirochetal Ag, which included the OspA, OspB, flagellin, Hsp60 and Hsp70 proteins. All three T cell clones reactive with heat shock proteins recognized a non-cross-reactive epitope unique to the spirochetal Ag. Analysis of the TCR V regions revealed preferential usage of V beta 5.1; 5 of 15 T cell clones that recognized an unidentified spirochetal Ag utilized this V beta gene segment. Most of the T cell clones recognized a given spirochetal Ag exclusively within the context of one HLA class II allele. However, two T cell clones, which recognized an unidentified Ag in the spirochetal lysate within the context of different HLA class II alleles, were both TCR V beta 5.1+, although each displayed a distinct alpha-chain. Moreover, in vitro incubation of this patient's PBMC with B. burgdorferi Ag resulted in a specific increase in the percentage of T cells expressing TCR V beta 5.1.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, was induced in Lewis rats with a CD4+, CD8- T cell line specific for peptide 68-86 of myelin basic protein. Within the line a wide array of TCR V beta genes was transcribed including the V beta 8, V beta 10, V beta 15, V beta 16, and V beta 19 families. Accumulation of T cells at the site of inflammation was determined by using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of rearranged TCR V beta transcripts derived from brain. By 8 to 10 h after i.p. infusion of the pathogenic T cell line, TCR V beta transcripts, including mainly V beta families that were predominantly rearranged by the line, could be identified in brains. Restricted TCR V gene transcripts with predominance of the V beta 8 family were identified in brain 48 h after injection, before onset of disease. Paralysis was apparent by 4 to 5 days after injection. At this time diverse V beta gene transcripts were detected in brain, reaching a maximum by day 9, when paralyzed rats have recovered. By day 14 a second stage of limited heterogeneity in the T cell infiltrate could be identified with predominant expression of V beta 8, V beta 9, V beta 10, and V beta 19. Interestingly, three out of these four V beta families were predominantly expressed within the encephalitogenic line. Thus, T cell migration to brain in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is characterized by a rapid penetration of T cells followed by a selective trapping of T cells before the clinical manifestations of disease. When clinical disease was present the T cell infiltrate was diverse, whereas in the post-acute phase of disease the T cells in the central nervous system had limited heterogeneity with selective accumulation of T cells transcribing the same V regions that were detected in the line that incited disease.

In order to establish whether such T cell responses are likely to be antigen-specific particularly with regard to myelin basic protein (MBP), we analysed T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements directly from MS brain plaques, using the polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed messenger RNA, and compared these with TCR of previously described MBP-specific T cell clones from MS and the rat model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Rearranged V beta 5.2 genes were detected in the brains of all patients who were HLA DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401. The V beta 5.2-D beta-J beta sequences in these MS brain plaques revealed five motifs. One of the common motifs was identical to that described for the VDJ region of a V beta 5.2 T-cell clone. This clone was from an MS patient who was HLA DRB1*1501, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401, and it was cytotoxic towards targets MBP peptide 89-106 (ref. 1). The deduced amino-acid sequence of this VDJ rearrangement, Leu-Arg-Gly, has also been described in rat T cells cloned from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis lesions, which are specific for MBP peptide 87-99 (ref. 2). VDJ sequences with specificity for this MBP epitope constitute a large fraction (40%) of the TCR V beta 5.2 N(D)N rearrangements in MS lesions. The capacity of rat T cells with these VDJ sequences to cause experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and the prevalence of such sequences in demyelinated human lesions indicate that T cells with this rearranged TCR may be critical in MS.

Most other amino acid side chains in the Ac1-11 peptide are essentially irrelevant for T cell stimulation and for disease induction. Further analysis revealed that binding to A alpha uA beta u occurred with a peptide that consists mainly of alanines and only three of the original residues of Ac1-11. Moreover, when used as a coimmunogen with MBP Ac1-11, this peptide inhibited EAE. The finding that a specific in vivo response can be generated by a peptide containing only five native residues provides evidence that disease-inducing TCRs recognize only a very short sequence of the MHC-bound peptide.

Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma, one neuroblastoma cell line and 4 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). mRNA transcripts of neither IL-1 nor IL-3, the biological activities of which were observed in rat primary cultured astrocytes, could be detected within these cell lines. Two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U138 and U373, expressed U251, glioma cells. After stimulation with IL-1 all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell line expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma specimens. The result shows that three out of four glioma specimens expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-6 or IL-8 may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the central nervous system.

In response to Ag-specific or -nonspecific stimulation, all of the Yersinia-reactive T cell clones and lines had a pattern of lymphokine secretion resembling that of murine (Th1) cells. A total of 50% of T cell lines and clones randomly isolated from a reactive arthritis patient, without prior in vitro stimulation with Yersinia Ag, also exhibited a Th1-like profile of cytokine secretion upon nonspecific activation. This indicates that the selective expansion of this subset of T cells had already occurred in vivo. The possibility that the predominance of Th1-like T cells was an artefact generated by the T cell cloning procedure was excluded; 50% of the randomly isolated T cell clones and lines produced IL-4, IL-5, or both cytokines upon nonspecific activation. These results indicate that Yersinia Ag selectively activate a Th1-like subset of T cells in patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis. Accumulation of such cells in the synovial tissue of patients with reactive arthritis may play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Recent studies have utilized inhibitor peptides that bind to restricting MHC class II molecules in order to inhibit EAE, presumably by means of competing with encephalitogenic epitopes. However, these studies leave open the possibility of alternative explanations, such as Ag-specific nonresponsiveness and immunodominance. In order to demonstrate that competition for MHC binding alone can inhibit EAE, the inhibitor peptide should ideally be structurally unrelated and nonimmunogenic yet physically associate with the MHC class II molecule. In this study, we show that the OVA-323-339 peptide, which is unrelated to the disease-inducing peptide, binds to A alpha uA beta u. However, although OVA-323-339 is extremely immunogenic in A alpha dA beta d-expressing BALB/c mice, it is nonimmunogenic in (PL/J x SJL)F1 and PL/J mice expressing A alpha uA beta u. When administered as a coimmunogen with Ac1-11, OVA-323-339 inhibited induction of EAE in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice. Myelin basic protein-89-101, which does not bind A alpha uA beta u, had no effect on the disease process. This study provides evidence that MHC class II binding alone can modulate the induction of EAE. The use of a nonimmunogenic non-self peptide to modulate an autoimmune disease minimizes the potential complications of immunodominance or alternative regulatory mechanisms associated with immunogenic peptide therapies and further confirms the MHC-blocking model of immunosuppression.

Primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families were used to analyze TCRV-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements in TILs in 8 human malignant glioma specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we detected limited TCR variable region, V alpha gene expression in malignant glial tumors and also V alpha 7 and V alpha 12 TCR genes were preferentially expressed. Usage of TCR V beta gene was not as restricted as in TCR V alpha. These TILs expressing a limited repertoire of TCRs might be isolated, expanded, and used therapeutically for treatment of malignant brain tumors.

The diversity of the variable region of the T cell receptor, however, has made it difficult to amplify the complete repertoire of T cell receptor transcripts. We have chosen to address this problem through the design of oligonucleotide primers specific for each of the known V alpha- and V beta-region T cell receptor families in order to characterize the T cell receptor repertoire. Using nonradioactive probes labeled with horse radish peroxidase, the system presented here allows for the rapid elucidation of the T cell receptor repertoire expressed in cells or tissue samples, such as those derived from autoimmune lesions. The identification of the T cell receptor repertoire involved in a pathogenic process can have therapeutic implications given the success of reversing experimental autoimmune disorders by directing specific forms of immunotherapy against V region gene products.

To test this possibility, we transplanted normal myoblasts from a father or an unaffected sibling into the muscle of eight boys with DMD, and assessed their production of dystrophin. Three patients with deletions in the dystrophin gene expressed normal dystrophin transcripts in muscle biopsy specimens taken from the transplant site one month after myoblast injection. Using the polymerase chain reaction we established that the dystrophin in these biopsies derived from donor myoblast DNA. These results show that transplanted myoblasts persist and produce dystrophin in muscle fibres of DMD patients.

However, the enormous diversity and variability of the T-cell receptor complex have made the amplification of the complete repertoire difficult. Several methods have been devised to address this problem. Each system is described with recent examples of its use and an assessment of its advantages and disadvantages. The use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction in T-cell receptor analysis is also discussed.

Peptide analogues of p30-42 containing single alanine substitutions were used in DR1-binding and T-cell proliferation assays to identify the major histocompatibility complex and TCR contact residues. Each T-cell clone was found to recognize p30-42 with a different fine specificity. However, a common core comprising amino acids 33-39 was found to be important for stimulation of all T-cell clones. Within this core two residues, Leu33 and Leu36, interact with the DR1 molecule, whereas Asp34, His35, Thr37, and Arg39 are important for TCR recognition in most of the clones. Computer modeling of the structure of p30-42 showed that an alpha-helical conformation is compatible with the experimental data. The analysis of TCR rearrangement revealed that the peptide was recognized by T-cell clones expressing different variable region alpha (V alpha) and variable region beta (V beta) chains, although a preferential use of V alpha 8-V beta 13 and V alpha 11-V beta 18 combinations was found in clones from the same donor. Understanding the details of the interaction of antigenic peptides with the major histocompatibility complex and TCR molecules should provide the theoretical basis to design T-cell epitopes and obtain more immunogenic vaccines.

In both diseases, circulating leukocytes penetrate the blood-brain barrier and damage myelin, resulting in impaired nerve conduction and paralysis. We sought to identify the adhesion receptors that mediate the attachment of circulating leukocytes to inflamed brain endothelium in EAE, because this interaction is the first step in leukocyte entry into the central nervous system. Using an in vitro adhesion assay on tissue sections, we found that lymphocytes and monocytes bound selectively to inflamed EAE brain vessels. Binding was inhibited by antibodies against the integrin molecule alpha 4 beta 1, but not by antibodies against numerous other adhesion receptors. When tested in vivo, anti-alpha 4 integrin effectively prevented the accumulation of leukocytes in the central nervous system and the development of EAE. Thus, therapies designed to interfere with alpha 4 beta 1 integrin may be useful in treating inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis.

While the effects of anti-I-A are profound, the exact mechanism for this suppression is unknown. We attempted adoptive transfer of this form of suppression by injecting lymphocytes from anti-I-A-treated animals into syngeneic recipients which were later injected with S-antigen. Histologically, globes of 75% of the anti-I-A-treated animals showed no inflammation while 25% of these animals developed mild uveitis. In the group of animals which were injected with S-antigen and also received spleen cells from anti-I-A-treated rats, only 1 showed mild uveitis while the remaining 7 had no inflammation. The animals undergoing adoptive transfer of spleen cells and which were primed with an irrelevant antigen, readily developed uveitis. Suppression of S-antigen-induced EAU was abrogated by pretreatment of donor animals with cyclophosphamide. In vitro studies revealed that spleen cells of S-antigen-primed, anti-I-A-treated donors specifically suppressed lymphocyte responses to S-antigen. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that generation of antigen-specific suppressor cells play a role in the anti-I-A immunotherapy of EAU.

From each of nine patients a single biopsy was taken. Southern hybridization analysis of amplified products revealed extensive heterogeneity of TCR V beta in most patients. On the other hand, restriction in V alpha gene expression was seen in several patients. A highly restricted V alpha repertoire was observed in all cases with arthritis of short duration. In addition, two of three samples of short duration yielded a more limited number of V beta transcripts than the others. No conformity was, however, seen in usage of individual V alpha and V beta transcripts among the investigated patients. The present data thus demonstrate variability in synovial TCR expression between rheumatoid arthritis patients, but they also indicate a development towards greater diversity with increasing disease duration, implicating the necessity for careful choice of cases, preferentially selecting for early stages of disease, when further analysing rheumatoid synovial T cells for TCR usage as well as for antigen specificity.

Primers for CSFs were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and 8 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM-CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell lines, and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138 MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1 beta + tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The results show that some of the tumor and its surrounding reactive lesions express G- and GM-CSF genes but normal brains do not. The concentration of G- and GM-CSF in supernatants of cultured cells was assessed at the protein level by ELISA. A low level of GM-CSF activity was constitutively present in all astrocytomas. G-CSF was detected in unstimulated U87MG and U138MG and other cell lines could synthesize G-CSF after the stimulation of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha at the level of mRNA. Furthermore, the concentration of CSFs increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta and/or TNF-alpha in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived CSFs may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the brain.

This study has led to novel immunotherapeutic approaches, many of which are based on the administration of synthetic peptides. Since short peptides are understood to be the minimal antigenic units bound by MHC molecules for recognition by T cells, they are attractive experimental tools for finely modulating specific immune responses. It is clear that a large number of defined peptides can dramatically influence the course of EAE. Table IV lists a number of potential mechanisms which may mediate disease prevention. Increasing evidence supports the idea that prevention of autoimmune disease can result from MHC-blockade by peptides which competitively bind to class II molecules. However, for some peptides such as the perplexing partial agonist Ac1-11[4A], the mechanism by which these precisely defined units act is not yet fully understood. Numerous hurdles hinder immediate clinical application of peptide-based immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the knowledge gained by probing experimental autoimmunity with defined peptides promises to inspire original and practical approaches to treating human autoimmune disease.

Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and fresh brain specimens by PCR. mRNA transcripts for IL-8 were detected in all neuroglial cells. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The result shows that tumor and cells of the surrounding reactive lesion express IL-8 genes, but it is not expressed in normal brains. Next, the concentration of IL-8 in supernatants of cultured cells was measured quantitatively by a solid phase ELISA assay. IL-8 activity was produced constitutively in all astrocytomas and increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF alpha, in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-8 may take part in neutrophil-mediated inflammation which accompanies infection, degeneration and malignancy in the brain.

Three out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, and genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta (1000 U/ml) all these cell lines expressed TNF-alpha genes. TNF-beta genes could not be detected in these cell lines even in the presence of any cytokine stimuli. We were able to detect expression of IFN-gamma genes within 2 astrocytoma cell lines (U87MG and A172), which interestingly did not show TNF-alpha activity. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM -CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition, we also examined gene expression of these cytokines within 4 human malignant astrocytoma specimens, 2 peritumoral brain and 2 autopsied normal brains. The results show that tumor and surrounding lesions express TNF-alpha (4 of 6), TNF-beta (1/6), IFN-gamma (4/6), G-CSF (3/6) and GM-CSF (5/6) but not normal brains. One tumor specimen also expresses TNF-beta as well as TNF-alpha genes (case 2).

In (PL/J x SJL) F1 mice, it is induced by immunization with the myelin basic protein peptide Ac1-11. Ac1-11 [4A], a myelin basic protein peptide analog with a single amino acid substitution, (i) binds to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and stimulates encephalitogenic T cells in vitro better than Ac1-11, (ii) is nonimmunogenic and nonencephalitogenic in vivo in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice, (iii) prevents EAE when administered before or at the time of immunization with Ac1-11, and (iv) prevents EAE when administered later, near the time of disease onset. Initial studies suggest that Ac1-11 [4A] does not prevent EAE by competitive inhibition or by activation of regulatory cells. Thus, substitution of a single amino acid in a myelin basic protein peptide confers the capacity to prevent rather than induce EAE, even after peptide-specific encephalitogenic T cells have been activated.

The identification and propagation of T cells with anti-tumor reactivity is crucial to the understanding of the human immune response to tumors, which may possibly be useful in the successful implementation of adoptive immunotherapy against cancer. Despite clinical evidence that a more favorable prognosis is associated with the degree of lymphocyte infiltration within a tumor, the actual role of TIL remains uncertain. In order to address this question, we examined the diversity of the RNA transcripts of TCR genes in TILs within 29 specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) method and primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families to analyze TCR V-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements, we detected a limited expression of TCR variable-region V alpha genes of TILs. TCR V beta gene rearrangements were more diverse than those for V alpha. In addition to restricted usage of TCR V alpha genes, preferential expression of V alpha 7 genes was found in 20 out of 29 cases (69%). Predominant usage of V alpha 7 genes was more remarkable in melanoma TILs (14/15) than in glial tumor TILs (6/14). These findings were also confirmed by Southern blot analysis with oligonucleotide probes for the constant (C) region of TCR alpha and beta chains. We suspect that some specific T-cell populations may be directed to antigenic determinants in melanoma cells.

In order to analyze TCR gene transcription in TILs within these tissues, we analyzed reverse transcribed complementary DNA from mRNA directly from tissues using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified products were confirmed by dot or Southern blot hybridization with C alpha or C beta oligoprobes. First, we investigated the diversity of TCR V alpha and V beta gene usage in human malignant melanoma patients with multiple metastasis. We found in one patient, bearing multiple skin lesions, that the patterns of TCR V alpha and V beta repertoires in different sites of the skin (leg and chest wall) were almost the same. However, in another patient with skin and brain melanomas, different TCR repertoires were presented. Next, we examined the usage of murine TCR V beta genes in TILs within the primary and metastatic sites (liver, lung, and brain) of C57BL/6 mice bearing B16-F10 murine melanoma. The population of TILs in each primary and metastatic site expressed from one to four TCR V beta genes. In each metastatic site, the profile of TCR V beta gene expression was different. A different TCR V beta usage in TILs distributed within metastases of various organs may reflect differences in tumor antigenicity at these sites or may be due to differential homing patterns to these tumors.

Lymphocyte cultures from 27 patients were characterized by cell-surface phenotypes, patterns of reactivity towards cells of the melanocytic origin and T-cell-receptor gene usage. Antimelanoma reactivity was found in cell-sorter-purified CD4+ To analyze sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ cells from a MLTC were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of exogenous interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 as well as irradiated OCM-1. Under these conditions, CD4+ T cells did not proliferate, perhaps because of the absence of antigen-presenting cells. However, CD8+ grew vigorously and 29 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones were isolated. On the basis of their pattern of lysis of OCM-1, a skin melanoma cell line M-7 and its autologous lymphoblastoid cell line LCL-7, the clones were categorized into three groups. Group 1, representing 52% of the clones, lysed all three target cells, and are alloreactive. However, since OCM-1 and M-7 did not share class I antigens, these clones recognized cross-reactive epitope(s) of the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) molecule. Group 2, constituting 28% of the clones, lysed both the ocular and skin melanoma cell lines but not LCL-7, and were apparently melanoma-specific. Unlike classical HLA-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes, these T cells might mediate the lysis of melanoma cells via other ligands or a more degenerate type of HLA restriction. For the latter, the HLA-A2 and -A28 alleles would have to act interchangeably as the restriction element for shared melanoma-associated antigen(s). Group 3, representing only 10% of the T cell clones, was cytotoxic only to OCM-1, but not to M-7 or LCL-7. These clones may recognize antigens unique to ocular melanoma cells. Our data suggest that choroidal melanoma patients can recognize melanoma-associated antigens common to and cutaneous presumbly their autologous tumor. Thus, choroidal melanoma, like its skin counterpart, may be responsive to immunotherapeutic regimens such as active specific or adoptive cellular immunotherapy.

Little is known about the immunobiology of myoblast transplantation. Transplantation rejection is mediated to a large extent by CD8+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class I HLA genes, and by CD4+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class II HLA genes. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is a potent inducer of HLA class II molecules as well as beta 2-microglobulin, which is co-expressed with HLA class I. IFN-gamma may be a critical cytokine involved in graft rejection. We purified human myoblasts by flow cytometry and incubated them in vitro for varying time periods with recombinant human IFN-gamma. The inducibility of HLA-DR and -DP molecules raises a note of caution concerning possible rejection phenomenon which might occur following myoblast transplantation.

Successive patients received doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg of antibody twice a week for 3 consecutive weeks. All patients had some clinical improvement, but responses were of relatively short duration. Serum levels of chimeric antibody varied as a function of dose. At the 80-mg dose level, antibody was readily observed in biopsied skin lesions. Although there was coating by antibody of most CD4 positive cells in the blood, there was no significant depletion of CD4 positive cells. Low-level antibody responses against the mouse Ig variable region and human Ig allotypic constant region determinants were observed in several patients, but none were of clinical significance. All but two patients made primary antibody and T-cell proliferative responses to a simultaneously administered foreign protein test antigen. However, there was marked suppression of the mixed lymphocyte reaction. We conclude that at the dose levels studied, a chimeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (1) had some clinical efficacy against mycosis fungoides; (2) was well tolerated; (3) had a low level of immunogenicity; (4) had immediate immunosuppressive effects; and (5) did not induce tolerance to a co-injected antigen.

We have used antibodies to the class II gene products of the major histocompatibility complex, the CD4 molecule on helper T cells, and the T-cell receptor. Monoclonal anti-class II antibodies have been administered to treat paralytic disease in the animal model of multiple sclerosis--experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These antibodies not only reverse acute paralytic disease but also decrease the number of relapses in a model of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis when given after the first attack. The advantage of this form of therapy is that it is haplotype specific. In other words, in a heterozygous individual it is possible to block the major histocompatibility gene associated with disease susceptibility while leaving other major histocompatibility gene products free for antigen presentation. Thus, animals given this form of immunotherapy are not significantly immunosuppressed. Antibodies to the CD4 molecule have been equally effective in treating animal models of autoimmunity. We and others have reversed ongoing paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Relapses have been diminished after the administration of anti-CD4. Antibodies to CD4 have been used successfully to treat animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis. Recent trials with anti-CD4 have been successful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The latter trial employed a chimeric human/mouse antibody. Antibodies to the variable region of the T-cell receptor have been employed to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) View details for [PubMedID 2081787](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2081787) We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody.

Comparison of DNA amplification patterns between patients with MS, and with control subjects who have other autoimmune conditions, with those in healthy control subjects and with an HTLV-I-infected cell line indicates that HTLV-I pol sequence is not present in the peripheral blood of patients with MS, and that the virus is not active in MS brain plaques.

A limited number of TCR V alpha genes were expressed and rearranged in these tumors, and TILs expressing V alpha 7 were found in seven of eight of these uveal melanomas. TCR gene usage is also restricted in experimental autoimmune disease, in T cells within organs like skin and other epithelial tissues, and in the brain of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

The 6.3 kb and 2.0 kb polymorphic markers, revealed by the PssI enzyme and the alpha chain probe, were shown to be significantly associated with MG. Italian MG patients were HLA typed, and allele frequencies showed a significant association of DR3 and DQw2 with MG. The relative risk calculated for DR3 was 7.4.

The chimeric antibodies retain identical affinity and specificity as the therapeutically effective prototype antibody, rat GK1.5, but are of different mouse isotypes. GK1.5 gamma 1, GK1.5 gamma 2a, and GK1.5 gamma 2b are significantly more effective at CD4+ cell depletion than rat GK1.5 when low doses of antibody are administered. In contrast, no depletion is seen with GK1.5 gamma 3 at any dose. Depletion of CD4+ cells in vivo is not correlated with either the ability of the antibody to mediate C-dependent cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro, implying antibody-mediated cytotoxic mechanisms occur in vivo. The chimeric antibodies were used to investigate the mechanism of GK1.5-mediated immunotherapy in a prototypic model of T cell-mediated autoimmunity, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Mice treated with a single dose of 100 micrograms of either GK1.5, GK1.5 gamma 1, or GK1.5 gamma 2a showed significant recovery within 72 h. In contrast, mice treated with 100 micrograms of GK1.5 gamma 3 showed only marginal improvement within the first 72 h and regressed within 5 days of treatment initiation.

In BALB/c mice, peptides corresponding to sequences 1-17, 70-82 and 189-199 generate T cell proliferative responses, induce the production of antibodies capable of neutralization of the toxin in the Chinese hamster ovary-cell assay, and protect mice from a shock-like syndrome caused by alternate injections of BSA and PT. Protection and neutralization correlated with the ability of these peptides to elicit high anti-PT titers. Different B cell epitopes were detected in other inbred mouse strains.

The peptide-Ia specificities of these clones were determined by testing the response to 1) a panel of peptide analogs of R1-11, 2) splenic APC from mice expressing MHC molecules from serologically distinct haplotypes, and 3) L cell transfectants expressing mutant/recombinant A beta cDNA containing combinations of polymorphic nucleotide sequences from the k and u alleles. Comparisons were made between the Ak-restricted clones and a previously characterized panel of Au-restricted clones. Certain Ak-restricted clones were able to recognize MBP peptide analogs that were not recognized by any of the Au-restricted clones. The Au-restricted T cell clones did not cross-react with R1-9 presented in the context of Ak, whereas the majority of the Ak-restricted clones responded to R1-9 presented in the context of Au. This nonreciprocal cross-reactivity was also reflected in the relative responses of the two sets of T cell clones to the interchange of u- and k-derived residues in the A beta chain. Residues in regions corresponding both the alpha-helical or beta-sheet portions of the hypothetical Ia three-dimensional structure were involved. The results suggest that overall specificity of the T cell clones is the summation of numerous distinct subspecificities for different regions of the peptide-Ia ligand.

Incubation of 4b.14a cells with previously with the 89-101 synthetic with 80 U/ml of IL-2, or allogeneic H-2Ik cells, resulted in a significant increase in the accumulation of intracellular cAMP. This increase was preceded by a peak in membranal adenylate cyclase (AC) activity. Parallel time kinetics but significantly higher cAMP production and AC activity were observed when the cells were treated with pertussis toxin. At the same concentrations the toxin inhibits cellular proliferative responses, assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation.

The chimeric GK1.5 gamma 2a, GK1.5 gamma 2b, and GK1.5 gamma 3 antibodies are more efficient than rat GK1.5 at C-mediated cytotoxicity.

The limited heterogeneity of these elements allowed prevention and treatment of clinical autoimmune disease with anti-T cell receptor monoclonal antibodies. These results and their potential value for other autoimmune diseases are discussed.

The critical residues associated with the immunomodulatory effects of PT were located around Glu140 in the S1 subunit. In man, T cell responses to PT are directed at S1 peptides distinct from Glu140. Two such epitopes, p64-75 and p151-161, are immunogenic in a panel of individuals covering a wide range of HLA genotypes. The response to PT peptides is HLA class II restricted. The response to p64-75 is blocked by an anti-HLA-DQ mAb, while that to p151-161 is blocked by an anti-HLA-DR mAb. These findings may allow for the development of a B. pertussis vaccine free from reactogenicity.

Six of 13 encephalitogen-specific T-cell clones were shown to express the variable beta-chain (V beta) 17a gene product (KJ23a+), whereas seven clones were KJ23a-. Both KJ23a+ and KJ23a- subpopulations were encephalitogenic in SJL/J when adoptively transferred. Depletion of KJ23a+ cells in vivo with the administration of the antibody KJ23a suppresses experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced with KJ23a+ T-cell lines. However, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced with either (i) encephalitogenic peptide p89-101, (ii) intact myelin basic protein, or (iii) KJ23a- T cells reactive to p89-101 cannot be prevented with monoclonal antibody KJ23a. These data indicate that in spite of the V beta 17a gene expression in a relatively large proportion of p89-101-specific T cells, such V beta gene use is not essential for the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in SJL/J mice. These results contrast with the predominance of V beta gene use (V beta 8.2) in T cells reactive to the encephalitogenic fragment (pR1-11) in PL/J mice. One reason for this lack of dominant use of a particular T-cell receptor V beta gene family in the autoimmune response to myelin basic protein in SJL/J mice stems from the observation that two encephalitogenic epitopes exist in p89-101. KJ23a- T cells are stimulated by the deleted peptide p89-100, whereas KJ23a+ T cells are not. Thus, in the response to an encephalitogenic fragment of myelin basic protein containing two nested epitopes, at least two distinct T-cell receptor V beta genes are expressed. These distinct T-cell subpopulations can each trigger experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These findings have implications for therapy of autoimmune disease with antibodies to the T-cell receptor gene products.

Initial investigations indicated that encephalitogenic murine determinants of MBP 89-169. Encephalitogenic T cell epitopes within these fragments have been identified. Each epitope is recognized by T cells in association with separate allelic I-A molecules. A hybrid I-E-restricted T cell clone that recognizes intact mouse (self) MBP has been examined. The epitope recognized by this clone includes MBP residues 35-47. When tested in vivo, p35-47 causes EAE. T cell recognition of p35-47 occurs only in association with I-E molecules. These results provide the first clear example that antigen-specific T cells restricted by I-E class II molecules participate in murine autoimmune disease. Furthermore, it is clear that there are multiple (at least three) discrete encephalitogenic T cell epitopes of this autoantigen, each recognized in association with separate allelic class II molecules. These results may be relevant to human autoimmune diseases whose susceptibility is associated with more than one HLA-D molecule.

In order to identify the encephalitogenic T cell epitope, we have examined the fine specificity of encephalitogenic SJL/J T cell clones with synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal 89-169 amino acids of MBP. These peptides were examined for their immunogenic and encephalitogenic activity in the SJL/J mouse. The SJL/J-derived, encephalitogenic T cell clone, 4b.14a, was shown to be responsive to rat myelin basic protein synthetic peptides pR89-101 (VHFFKNIVTPRTP) as well as to intact MBP. Its response was effectively blocked by mAb 10-2.16 (anti-I-As) as was the response to intact MBP. Furthermore, pR89-101 was revealed to be highly immunogenic for the (PLSJ)F1 mouse in terms of lymphocyte proliferation, but not for the PL/J mouse, in spite of the fact that there exists a strong bias to H-2u restricted responses in the (PLSJ)F1 mouse at the T cell level. By using pR89-101, T cells of (PLSJ)F1 origin were revealed to recognize the peptide in association with the I-As molecule on (PLSJ)F1 antigen presenting cells (APC). When examined for encephalitogenicity for the SJL/J mouse, pR89-101 was found to be as encephalitogenic as intact rat MBP. These results demonstrated that MBP peptide pR89-101 is a major encephalitogenic determinant for the SJL/J mouse.

Analysis of T cell receptors of myelin basic protein-specific encephalitogenic T cell clones derived from six different PL/J (H-2u) or (PL/J x SJL) F1 (H-2uxs) mice revealed a limited heterogeneity in primary structure. In vivo, the majority of T lymphocytes recognize the N-terminal MBP-nonapeptide in association with I-Au and utilize the V beta 8 gene element. cDNA-sequencing showed that all T cell receptors from a panel of such T cell clones, grown in vitro, share the same V alpha gene segment. Despite heterogeneity in the D-J regions, the clones unexpectedly display a striking similarity in fine specificity. Based on these results, prevention and reversal of autoimmune disease with V beta 8-specific monoclonal antibodies was achieved.

Polymorphism in alpha chain genes was observed in TaqI-digested DNA samples with bands at 10.2 and 6.2-2.1 kb. Mendelian codominant inheritance for all three polymorphisms was confirmed in family studies. The gene frequencies for these alleles were determined in a sample of 70 normal unrelated Caucasian individuals, and were shown to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There were no significant differences in the frequency of these polymorphic alpha and beta alleles between patients with multiple sclerosis and patients with myasthenia gravis as compared to a panel of control healthy individuals.

Nucleotide sequence polymorphism in the genes that encode the class II MHC products determines the specificity of the immune response and is correlated with the development of autoimmune diseases. This study identifies certain class II polymorphic amino acid residues that are strongly associated with susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and pemphigus vulgaris.

TCR V beta expression was examined by FACS analysis with mAbs specific for the V beta 8 subfamily of TCR beta chain genes. 14 of 18 (78%) NH2-terminal MBP-specific clones examined express a member of the TCR V beta 8 subfamily. Southern analysis was used to identify which member(s) of the TCR V beta 8 subfamily is expressed by these clones. Each of four clones examined uses V beta 8.2, though two different V beta 8.2-J beta 2 combinations were identified. Our findings indicate that there is restricted TCR V beta usage in the autoimmune T cell response to the dominant encephalitogenic NH2-terminal epitope of the MBP. The use of an mAb to the antigen-specific TCR in the prevention of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease has been investigated. Our results demonstrate that in vivo administration of a TCR V beta 8-specific mAb prevents induction of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

Susceptibility to PV could be conferred either by sequences shared between the DR4 and DRw6 haplotypes or by different sequences in these haplotypes. We have examined the distribution of DR and DQ beta-chain and DQ alpha-chain alleles in PV patients and in control subjects by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and sequence analysis of in vitro amplified DNA. Ninety percent (34/38) of the DR4 haplotypes in patients contain a specific DR beta I sequence present in 36% (16 of 44) of DR4 controls (P = 0.001). This sequence is also found in DRw6 haplotypes. However, it is present in only 25% (6 of 24) of DRw6 patients. The results of our analysis indicate that predisposition to PV is conferred by different sequences in DR4 and DRw6 haplotypes. The DR4 susceptibility is highly associated with the Dw10 DR beta I allele, implicating the polymorphic residues in the third hypervariable region. The DRw6 susceptibility is strongly associated with a rare DQ beta allele (DQB1.3). This allele differs from a common DQ beta allele (DQB1.1) only by a valine----aspartic acid substitution at position 57.

The toxin is a principal determinant of virulence in whooping cough and is a primary candidate for an acellular pertussis vaccine, yet it is unclear whether the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is required for both pathogenic and immunoprotective activities. A B. pertussis strain that produced an assembled pertussis holotoxin with only 1 percent of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the native toxin was constructed and was found to be deficient in pathogenic activities associated with B. pertussis including induction of leukocytosis, potentiation of anaphylaxis, and stimulation of histamine sensitivity. Moreover, this mutant strain failed to function as an adjuvant and was less effective in protecting mice from intracerebral challenge infection. These data suggest that the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is necessary for both pathogenicity and optimum immunoprotection.

Prior studies have established that monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies can reverse EAE. To determine whether immunoglobulin isotype plays a role in the therapy of EAE with anti-CD4 antibody, an isotype switch variant family of the mouse IgG1 anti-rat CD4 antibody W3/25 was isolated and IgG2a W3/25 all had identical binding capacities for rat CD4+ T cells. Although all three W3/25 isotypes showed some beneficial effects in the amelioration of EAE, the IgG1 and IgG2a W3/25 antibodies were superior to the IgG2b W3/25 in the treatment of EAE. Multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of T cell subpopulations from treated rats showed that none of the antibodies of the W3/25 isotype switch variant family substantially depleted CD4+ target cells in vivo. These experiments demonstrate that immunoglobulin isotype is important in the monoclonal antibody therapy of autoimmune disease. They indicate that therapy of EAE may be successful without a major depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes. Immunotherapy may be optimized by selecting an appropriate isotype of a monoclonal antibody.

This phenomenon, which has been termed 'allele-specific immunosuppression', is antigen-specific, long-lasting and transferrable with Thy-1-positive spleen cells. This type of immunosuppression has been applied to animal models of autoimmune disease, in both homozygous and heterozygous animal models. Anti-I-A monoclonal antibodies are capable of preventing, suppressing and treating experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), of partially suppressing experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, and of preventing the onset of type I insulin-dependent diabetes in the BB/W diabetic rat. In addition, this type of immunotherapy has succeeded in almost completely suppressing nephritis in NZB X NZW F1 mice, which normally develop severe lupus-like nephritis. Significant toxicity, which may be due to anti-allotype antibodies, anti-idiotype antibodies, or to impurities in the monoclonal antibody preparations, has been encountered in the BB/W diabetic rat. In addition, attempts to extend these observations to EAE in the cynomolgus monkey have encountered significant mortality which appears to be attributable to the monoclonal antibody injections (anti-HLA-DR). The mechanism of this toxicity and means of circumventing it are currently under investigation. These results demonstrate the critical role of I-A molecules in the induction and continuance of the autoimmune process in these experimental animal models.

Both the N-terminal acetyl moiety and the first residue (Ala) are necessary for recognition. Only N-terminal MBP peptides recognized by these clones were found to cause encephalomyelitis (EAE) in vivo.
