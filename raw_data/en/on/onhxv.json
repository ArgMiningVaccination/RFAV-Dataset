They may be of physical, emotional or spiritual nature, or even caused by events in other lifetimes. You will experience different methods such as energy scanning, as well as the readings of candle flames, eggs, palms or guinea pigs. These powerful and insightful readings allow the clients to acquire insights and clarity of their life's problems and issues, and to live more consciously. NOTE: Each shaman will most likely prescribe you different herbal teas, special baths, and dietary changes for your optimal health. La Limpia LA LIMPIA, the High Andes' foremost traditional healing ceremony, is a multi-component physical and spiritual energy purification system. It is used frequently whenever people get sick, are emotionally distressed, depressed, have bad luck in relationships, business or work, or for any other misfortunes that arise in their lives. Each of the elements (fire, air, water) and tools (rum, eggs, candles, smoke, flowers, herbs, plants, perfume and stones) used carries a spiritual symbolism and a scientific reasoning. La Limpia transforms the egg-shaped electromagnetic field (the illuminating body) surrounding our physical body, which gets contaminated by our life's traumas, memories, attachments, connection to ancestors, and negative energies. It removes anger, curses, envy, bad air, energy attachments, and spirit possession. Hence, it creates a new surge of upbeat positive energy, which allows for new clarity, and for a true healing to take place. What to wear: The transformative and powerful cleansing ceremony is performed using the blowing of Trago-sugar cane rum alcohol, fire, smoke, oils, rubbing of eggs, tapping of flowers, herbal plants and other sacred natural elements. Hence, traditionally no clothing or very minimal dressing is highly recommended (underwear/shorts, bathing suit). It allows the skin to better absorb the healing essences and to discharge negative energies. However, you can decide to dress according to your level of comfort. Either way, please wear comfortable and loose clothing. Taki Sami TAKI SAMI (In Kichwa - Pulsing Sound) Taki Sami is a sound vibrational healing method using traditional musical instruments, such as condor feather flutes, panpipes (made of jade, ceramic, bamboo, wood or bones), conch shells, rattles, drums, bells, stringed instruments, as well as chants and voice expression. Each instrument's frequencies reverberate and penetrate deep into a specific part of our physical, emotional and spiritual bodies and activate it. It also vibrates our bones and each of our body's organs, releasing and removing bad energies (blocked energies, pain, fears, and traumas), and letting the natural energy flow again in harmony. Shamanic Bodywork SHAMANIC BODYWORK- The Andes shamans offer a multiplicity of body manipulations, sacred movements, and powerful massages. They aim to bring a person into a flow of life through connection with Pachamama- Mother Earth- and the cosmos by releasing old energy, and emotional blockages and pains. This can heal the digestive system, recover fertility problems, and resolve deep feminine issues and womb conditions. These indigenous traditional techniques can help in promoting better body posture and deeper sleep, releasing headaches, helping structural body problems and creating an all-around improved life. Purification ceremony A TEMAZCAL \"house of heat\" is a type of sweat lodge in a permanent circular structure, which originated with pre-Hispanic Indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica. It was used as part of a curative ceremony to purify the body, mind, and spirit. It was also used for healing the sick, improving health, and for women to give birth. It continues to be used today in Indigenous cultures of Mexico and Central and South America for spiritual and health reasons. To produce the heat, volcanic stones are heated and placed in a pit located in the center of the Temazcal. The enchanting prayer ceremony has four-parts correlating to the four directions or medicine wheel. The profound sweating release toxins held in the tissues and muscles, while participants experience a deep connection to the spirit world through visions, transformation, and rejuvenation. Plant Medicine ceremonies Participation in these ceremonies are optional and solely the participant's responsibility. Please educate yourself in these plants by reading more or clicking the links below. HUACHUMA or San Pedro (in Spanish), a tall green cactus, has a long history of being used in traditional Andean culture and is considered as a plant teacher medicine for healing and spiritual divination. The effect of the cactus brew allows users to reach heaven while still on earth. The nighttime ceremony, accompanied by traditional music and sounds, is truly magical and transformative. It is a very strong masculine medicine that opens one's heart to love and peace within the self and the cosmos. It will show you how other dimensions merge with the physical reality, our multidimensional l perception of nature, and give you the power to make the changes necessary in your life.

Called the \"vine of the soul,\" or \"vine of the dead,\" it is a brew prepared from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and Psychotria viridis leaves. The result is a powerful feminine energy hallucinogenic brew that contains DMT. The psychedelic effects of ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation, the mixing of sensory modalities, and psychological introspection that may lead to great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties (known as \"the purge\") are vital to discharge traumas, parasites, bacteria, and viruses from the digestive system. The all-night potent ceremony is lead by \"icaros\" - the sacred chants and music.

THE ANDES SACRED HEALING MOVEMENTS The sunrise movement exercises taught by Taita Don Jacho Castelo are an ancient healing practice that is performed by the indigenous people of the High Andes of Ecuador. These sacred movements help invigorate and cleanse our bodies from toxins, remove blocked energies, improve digestion, stimulate breathing after our night's sleep, and bring us back into balance. Spiritually, these sacred movements help us reconnect to the four elements, universal spirits, and most importantly, to Taita Inti (Kichwa) - Father Sun, whose loving light energy and warmth gives life and power equally to everything on this Earth, and to Mother Earth (Pachamama) - the earth/time mother who sustains life on this earth. This series of movements is simple and easy to perform. You will feel centered, balanced, recharged and ready to start a new day. "}
