During the clerkship, you will learn clinical medicine while working side-by-side with teams of residents and/or faculty providing care to a cohort of inpatients. As your knowledge and skills grow, you will earn increasing patient care responsibility. This direct patient care experience is complemented by a unique enrichmen t in which you also work in small groups with a clerkship director and hone essential clinical skills (including intermediate -level communications skills, physical diagnosis, and clinical reasoning). Your education is supplemented with conferences that fo cus on core topics. The clerkship is divided into two mini -blocks of 4 weeks each, and most students spend time at 1 or 2 of our clinical sites. The goal of the clerkship is to develop someone who we would want to care for our family members; a professi onal, highly caring clinician who is increasingly independent and knowledgeable, and who is a strong team member. The Medicine Clerkship aims to: Introduce you to the world of internal medicine Develop your skills as a clinician Enable you to become a co ntributing, collaborating team member Support your skills as a self -directed learner The Self -Directed Learner We welcome you to the world of medicine, where growth in the body of knowledge is accelerating and evolving at an unprecedented pace. You must be engaged and take ownership of your learning to maximize your learning experience on this clerkship. The Medic ine Clerkship builds upon the learner -centered approach and challenges you to be a self -directed, lifelong learner. The dynamic nature of learning while caring for patients requires that you become adept at identifying your learning needs and acting upon t hem. You will need to continually ask relevant questions, find credible, evidence -based responses, and integrate this information into patient care. As a student, you will learn to be a flexible learner who employs a variety of appropriate resources ranging from textbooks and the medical literature to consultants, and one who solicits and responds effectively to feedback. The clerkship provides you wit h many opportunities to read in -depth, to become the \"local expert\" on your patients, to share your learning with your team, and to improve continuously. Contributing, Collaborating Team Member Medicine is team -based, requiring you to work effectively with multiple health care providers from different disciplines and within a complex system . The Clerkship challenges you to \"identify your niche\" from which to consistently contribute to both patient care and team learning, and to develop the habits and sk ill sets that will enable you to function effectively within and improve the systems in which our patients receive their care. 12 Becoming a Clinician The primary focus of the clerkship is to increase your ability to function as a caring, increasingly inde pendent clinician while supervised on a multidisciplinary team. A clinician in this setting is someone who addresses all dimensions of patient care: communication, diagnosis, treatment, and healing. You will do so by growing into taking a central role in t he care of assigned patients while also learning from other patients who are on your team. Pre-requisite knowledge and skills Students must have completed their second -year curriculum and the Transitional Clerkship and have taken the Step -I exam prior to taking this clerkship.

Observed Clinical Reasoning Assessment (OCRA) 12% Directly observed FOCUSED H and P 3% Professionalism See below Other components that need to be completed in order to pass the clerkship Patient log Medicine Structured Observations of Clinical Skills Cards (SOCS) Standard Clerkship Clinical Grade Procedures/Policies Preceptors will provide clinical evaluations that contain the \"raw data\" on the student's clinical performance. Preceptors DO NOT determine the final \"word\" grade. You are encouraged to regularly ask for specific behaviorally -based feedback on your clinical skills from your preceptors. However, do not ask them what \"word grade\" you will get, as that is a multifactorial process of which the clinical evaluation is one component. The CSEF form will be used to numerically calculate your clinical grade: 1 to 5 points (depending on which box is checked) for each domain which will be averaged to give you a final score out of 5. Categories: Needs intensive remediation (1); Needs direc ted coaching (2); Approaching competency (3); Competent (4) or Achieving behaviors beyond the 3rd year competency criteria (5) to get a final number in each domain. This can be rounded to the nearest number using standard rounding for the CSEF domain and this is the box that should be checked (e.g. if an 19 average of 2.4 then the student should have needs directed coaching (2) checked off). Each CSEF will be weighted based on how long the student worked with each evaluator (Interns weighted at 30%). CSEF Cl inical Grade Calculations should be made using the 0. 01 decimal point in each domain (though the rounded number will be checked off on the final CSEF) to give a final number. Any average of <1.5 in any domain = an automatic fail for the clerkship Any average of < 2.5 in any domain = an automatic pass for the clerkship and a meeting with the MEO for clinical coaching >2.5 in all domains, standard rounding will be used <2.00 = Clinical fail which will = a fail for the clerkship 2.00-3.44 = Clinical p ass 3.45 -4.44= Clinical high pass >4.45 =Clinical h onors The clinical grade will be reported in the CSEF final narrative Primary preceptors at sites with multiple preceptors will collect evaluation data from the other clinicians with whom the student works. The primary preceptor will collate this data and submit the final clinical evaluation. Clerkship Specific Clinical Grade Procedures/Policies Guiding Principles - We strive to provide a grading system that is: Fairly applied - a system that we follow for all students. Transparent - students can clearly see the process by which the grade is derived. Discriminating - the HONORS grade represents a performance of true distinction. Based on your absolute performance. There is no 'curve' or fixed percentage about who can/cannot get HONORS. Performance -based - what the student does and is reported - not based on potential The final CSEF score will be converted to a score out of 100 to generate the clinical grade (which would count towards 60% of the overall final grade). Clinical performance grade will be represented on the final grade form, regardless of final grade. Clinical performance grade may also be represented in the final narrative, formative or profess ionalism grade comments. The CSEF grade is complemented by a narrative description on the MedHub form and by other observations conveyed by instructors (e.g., verbal or email comments). These may be used by the Clerkship Faculty to help determine the student's final CSEF score, if and when appropriate. The Observed Clinical Reasoning Assessment (OCRA), including oral and written components, is graded by 1 core clerkship faculty (12% of final grade). The Directly Observed Focused History and Physical E xam Assessment is graded by 1 core clerkship faculty (3% of final grade). If the student scores > 5th percentile nationally on the initial attempt at the NBME Shelf Exam , they are assigned points for the NBME Shelf Exam component of the final grade in pro portion to the 2 -digit score. The higher the 2 -digit score, the more points the student receives. The shelf points are used in the final grade calculation. Integrating the Clinical Performance Score into the Final Grade To achieve an overall final grade of HONORS, the student must achieve >90 Total Points. To achieve an overall final grade of HIGH PASS, the student must achieve 80 to < 90 Total Points. To achieve an overall final grade of PASS, the student must achieve 75 to < 80 Total Points. 20 The clinical numeric grade will be worth 60% of the final grade of the clerkship and will be calculated out of a 5 - point scale from the CSEF The shelf is worth 25% of the final grade of the clerkship. The 2 -digit score will be used to calculate the nume ric score out of 100 Deriving the Final Composite Grade from the input. An example: A. 60% ---Clinical evaluation ---CSEF score converted to score of 80 out of 100 points. x 0.6 B. 25 % ---NBME shelf exam --- 84 points x .25 C. 15 % --- Other including averaged sco re of the Observed Clinical Reasoning Assessments (OCRA) and Directly Observed Focused H and P Assessment=87 x .15 (80) x 0.60 + (84) x 0.25 + (87) x .15= 48 + 21 + 13.1 = 82.1 This student's final (composite) grade for the clerkship is final grade HIGH P ASS with a clinical grade HIGH PASS. Professional Conduct and Expectations Evaluation of a medical student's performance while on a clinical clerkship includes all expectations outlined in the syllabus and clerkship orientation as well as the student's professional conduct, ethical behavior, academic integrity, and interpersonal relationships with medical colleagues, department administrators, patients, and patients' families. Student expectations include those listed below in professional comportment sections . If there are multiple professionalism concerns through a clerkship the student will not be eligible to receive honors on the clerkship. A student will be given feedback prior to receiving t heir final grade for the clerkship if their professional conduct is of concern. Prior to receiving a final grade, if a clerkship director determines that a student does not meet the professional conduct and expectations of the clerkship , a student will fail the clerkship. Any professionalism lapses resulting in either a clerkship fail or ineligibility to receive honors will require narrative comments by the clerkship director in the summative comment s section of the final evaluation and the student will be given feedback in advance of the final grade form submission. Shelf Exam Failure & Remediation If a student fails their shelf exam, they will receive an Incomplete for the clerkship and retake the exam at the end of the year. Students: will not recei ve a Fail on their transcript if they pass the reexamination. will not be eligible for a final grade of honors - if the final grade calculation would earn the student honors, they will receive high pass as a final grade. Students would still be eligible to receive a clinical honors. If a student fails the reexamination, they will have Fail on their transcript, and have to remediate the clerkship. Clerkship Failure & Remediation Fail Clinical - If the student fails the clinical portion of the clerkship ( Numeric Score or <1.5 on any domain on the final CSEF or < 2 averaged on the final CSEF =Clinical Fail) , or does not meet the standards for professionalism either clinically or within the core clerkship curriculum, the student will receive a fai l overall and must retake the clerkship in its entirety. Fail Observed Clinical Reasoning Assessment - If the student fails only the OCRA component, the student must repeat the OCRA. If the student fails a 2nd time, the student may fail the clerkship and have to retake the clerkship in its entirety. If a student fails a third - or fourth -year clerkship (Numeric Score or <1.5 on any domain on the final CSEF or < 2 averaged on the final CSEF =Clinical Fail ), the student will receive a Fail grade and will be required to repeat the 21 clerkship. The grade for the repeated clerkship will be calculated based on the grading criteria outlined in the syllabus for Pass, High Pass, or Honors independent of the prior Fai l. The original Fail grade will remain on the transcript. The original summative evaluation narrative will be included in the MSPE, in addition to the summative evaluation from the repeated clerkship. If a student fails the remediated clerkship again and the SEPC allows for another remediation, the grade for the repeat clerkship will still be calculated based on the grading criteria outlined in the course syllabus for (Pass, High Pass, or Honors). The original two failures will remain on the transcript. Th e repeated course will be listed again, and the word (Repeat) will appear next to both course names. Grade Review Policy The School's Grade Reconsideration Policy is located in the Policies and Procedures for Evaluation, Grading and Promotion of Chobania n & Avedisian School of Medicine MD Students: http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/faculty/evaluation -grading -and-promotion -of-students/ AME/Kaiser Core Faculty Direct Observation During the third year, students will be directly observed by their core AME (or Kaiser) faculty three times throughout the year. They will also submit one write up in their core AME/Kaiser faculty's discipline, and one video of a session with an SP for rev iew and feedback. At the end of the year, the core AME/Kaiser faculty will write a narrative summary describing the student's growth trajectory and competency development in the observed domains . This narrative will be included as part of the End of Third Year Assessment (in addition to the EOTYA 6 station OSCE) . Formative Assessments The purpose of formative assessment is to improve student learning by providing feedback on how well they are learning skills and content during the clerkship. Formative asse ssment s are not included in the calculations of students' final grades . Each clerkship has required FOCuS (Feedback based on Observation of Clinical UME Student) forms which must be completed by the mid/end of the clerkship. These forms will provide formative assessment through direct observation of CSEF behaviors . Each student is required to complete one interviewing technique and one physical exam FOCuS form on each clerkship. On the Medicine clerkship, the Directly Observed Focused H and P counts towards this requirement. In addition, the Medicine clerkship has specific direct observation cards (SOCS) to be filed for review at mid/end of clerkship. Aga in, these forms are more opportunity for the student to obtain feedback from direct observation of skills that are specific to Internal Medicine. FOCUS Cards and Internal Medicine Structured Observations of Clinical Skills (SOCS): These exercises are desig ned to assist the student in obtaining ongoing, real -time feedback after being directly observed performing a variety of skills (interviewing a patient, performing physical exam skills including 1) JVP assessment, 3) Cardiac exam, 4) Pulmonary exam). Thes e exercises will be student -initiated and completed on the wards by residents and attendings. Two of these cards (SOCS) should be completed by the time of the mid -clerkship feedback sessions. The Internal Medicine SOCS cards will be turned in at the en d of the rotation as part of the passport. 22 Neither the formative assessment exercises of FOCUS cards nor Medicine SOCS cards are not included in the numeric calculations of students' final grades. Narrative comments or other observations from these direct observations may be included in the final grade. Process for FOCUS and SOCS Forms (Typically a 5 -10 minute exercise) 1. Student initiates by speaking with observer (Resident, Attending or Fellow) 2. MD or student can identify patient 3. Hand observer the passport PRIOR to the patient encounter 4. Observation of encounter 5. Feedback on encounter 6. Observer and student sign card 7. Turn in FOCUS card and SOCS forms as part of the passport at the end of the clerkship Clinical Problem Solving Cases (see individual case learning objectives) Student Report These group discussions about real patients provide exposure to clinical problems commonly encountered in medicine. These will provide a good opportunity to practice clinical reasoning and the OCRA style of thinking for commonly encountered medical problems seen on the inpatient wards. A mini -course on interpreting the ECG -Apply a systematic approach to interpret the EKG. See passport for a sample tool/guide of how to systematically approach interpreting ECGs. Small group sessions with your Clerkship Director. These sessions focus on refining core skills and building advanced skills in: Write -up and oral presentations ~2 writeups turned in/4 week block Bedside rounds Practice interview, exam skills with a parti cular focus on the CV exam, Chest/Pulmonary Exam, and Volume Assessment Clinical reasoning practice in case -based discussions Integrating the medical literature into patient care Skills: ECG, Simulation Mid-clerkship feedback Formative Assessment and Feed back Policy Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine ensures that each medical student is provided with formative assessment early enough during each required course or clerkship to allow sufficient time for remediation. Formative assessm ent occurs at least at the midpoint of each required course or clerkship four or more weeks in length. Full Policy: http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/education/medical -education/policies/formative -assessment - and-feedback/ 23 Mid-Clerkship Review You and you r clerksh ip director, site director or primary faculty/preceptor will complete the Mid-clerkship Evaluation form at the mid clerkship point. The purpose of this evaluation is to give the student a chance to understand both their strengths as well as opportunit ies to improve . The feedback received at the mid -clerkship review is intended to allow the student to improve their clinical skills in real time. Best practices regarding feedback include: Start with getting the student's perspective on how they performed or a re performing. ( Students - please anticipate being asked \"How do you think you performed the skill, i.e., how did it go?\") Feedback should be specific and actionable. ( Students : Ask \" What could I do differently next time?\") Feedback should be based on direc t observation (i.e. What has been seen). Feedback should be timely (in close proximity to when behavior was observed). Feedback should be respectful and encourage future growth. Final Summative Assessments The final summative assessment will be based on the clerkship grading policy and include a final narrative describing your overall grade, clinical grade, based on the CSEF (Clinical Student Evaluation Form) , and other assessments , depending on the clerkship. The sum mative narrative must include a final summative statement regarding your professionalism on the clerkship (meet expectations or did not meet expectations) per the AAMC MSPE requirements. The final grade form summative narrative appears in your MSPE and is based on aggregate comments from your individual CSEFs and is written by a site director/clerkship director and is reviewed by the clerkship director before submission. NBME Subject Examination Students will take the Medicine NBME Subject Examination on th e last Friday of the clerkship (unless otherwise communicated by the Medical Education Office ). Students are given a reading day the day before the exam. Students do not report to their clerkship site on the reading day or the day of the exam. Students will be given 2 hours and 45 minutes to complete this exam. Shelf exam dates can be found in the 3rd year google calendar . 24 Remotely administered assessments Students are responsible for ensuring that they meet any technical needs required for remotely administered assessments (e.g., NBME Shelf Exams, OCRAs). This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring: computer specifications meet requirements outlined on t he Alumni Medical Library website: https://www.bumc.bu.edu/medlib/computing/busmrequirements/ for NBME shelf exams, the student runs the laptop certification process noted below a consistent and stable internet connection a quiet testing space where the student will not be disturbed during assessment administration Clerkships will reserve BUMC space as an onsite testing space for any remotely administered assessments. Students who do not have an appropriate testing space or prefer to test on campus should reach out to their clerkship coordinator at least two weeks prior to the assessment to make arrangement s to test on campus. Students with technical difficulties duri ng a remotely administered assessment who do not take their assessment at a designated campus location will not be able to submit a grade reconsideration request solely for this reason. Shelf Exam Laptop Certification Process Students must certify their la ptops one week before the NBME Subject Exam and again on the day before the exam. Instructions are provided on the Alumni Medical Library website at: http://www.bumc.bu.edu/medlib/servi ces/computing/nbme/ If a student has technical difficulties during a shelf exam, they must report this to the clerkship coordinator. The clerkship coordinator must inform the Medical Education Office, and the student is required to have their laptop eval uated by BUMC IT before their next shelf Exam -center/ Make -Up Exams Students needing to make up the exam or remediate only the exam port ion of the clerkship must contact the Clerkship Coordinator to arrange for a make -up/remediation date. Students may not take a make -up or remediation exam during any block they currently have a scheduled rotation. Make -up and remediation exams will typical ly be scheduled at the end of the third -year blocks between mid-May and early June. Observed Clinical Reasoning Assessments Key domains of clinical reasoning include information gathering, hypotheses generating, problem representation, differential diagno sis, identifying a leading diagnosis, providing justification, and developing a management plan. This specific assessment of clinical reasoning highlights the domains of information gathering, identifying a leading diagnosis, providing justification and developing a basic management plan. 25 Objectives: For the clinical problem(s) addressed, generate a patient -specific differential diagnosis, obtain a focused history and physical that is relevant to the differential and develop initial steps to evaluate your differential Explain your reasoning and describe the most important and relevant pathophysiology for the condition(s) Identify the most useful diagnostic tests, and interpret their results Recommend initial treatment These link to the followi ng clerkship learning objectives: IV. Communicate clinical information accurately and demonstrate your understanding of the patient's problems, through concise, convincing, well -organized patient presentations, admission write -ups, progress notes, and handoffs that are appropriately focused for the audience, purpose and time available for the communication. V. Identify and prioritize your patients' problems, formulate an appropriate differential diagnosis and outline an approach to diagnosis and managemen t that is supported by clinical data and sound reasoning. VI. Demonstrate a core foundation of knowledge (scientific, ethical, socio -cultural) guided by the course objectives that is necessary both to provide high quality patient care and to understand advan ces in medicine. Process for the Observed Clinical Reasoning Assessment (OCRA) There is one oral OCRA (oral exam with 1 clerkship faculty, date and time TBA and will occur weeks 4 - 8) and 2 written OCRAs ( 30 minutes each, administered via Blackboard on t he final Wednesday of the Medicine rotation. A list of students and their assigned date of the oral OCRA will be disseminated in advance. Assigned dates will be in weeks 4 -8 of the clerkship. This formal evaluation will be done by core clerkship faculty. This evaluation will take place during the 4 -8th week of the clerkship, unless extenuating circumstances do not allow. The student will complete the observed oral assessment (1) and written assessments (2) on the dates and times provided by the clerkship. The oral and written OCRAs will each be scored from 0 -100 (based on a grading rubric). Each OCRA component (1 oral and 2 written exams) is weighted at 4% of the final grade. Thus the OCRA's 3 components (1 oral and 2 written) will in total be 12% of the f inal grade. Students will be asked to sign an honor code confirming that they will not share any information about the oral and written assessments with any fellow students. This includes the problems, diagnoses, details of the cases, or the questions they are asked. 26 Failure to meet the expectations outlined above will result in a reduction in the student's score, and possible failure of the OCRA component. Fail Observed Clinical Reasoning Assessment - If the student fails only the OCRA, the student must repeat the OCRA. If the student fails a 2nd time, the student may fail the clerkship and have to retake the clerkship in its entirety. To best prepare for the OCRA: The OCRAs are based on the Medicine BIG 10. For each of the BIG 10 diagnoses in the Medicine clerkship (see Required Patient Encounters), the student should be able to define/describe: Illness scripts (IS) of the Medicine Big 10 problems/diagnoses - one way that experts store information (as chunks) about medical conditions in long term me mory that enables them to store and readily retrieve that information An Illness Script includes: Who gets the condition? What are predisposing factors How does it present? Clinical manifestations - defining features With regard to symptoms, signs, study re sults Temporal aspects of the presentation - onset, course of the condition Core pathophysiology Differential diagnosis of Medicine Big 10 Evaluation/Diagnosis - which tests to order, when to order, how to interpret for disease related to the Medicine Big 10 Initial management of Big 10 and related diagnoses Prognosis Prevention 27 Script to be provided to the student at the start of the Observed Clinical Reasoning Assessment: You will be presented with a case vignette over the next 30 minutes. We will give you a brief history to read. This is just to get you started. Feel free to take notes as you learn more about your patient. We will ask you for an initial differential, and then ask you to refine the differential as you gather more history about the patient. TAKE NOTES ON YOUR PATIENT. WRITE OUT YOUR DIFFERENTIAL - YOU WILL BE ASKED TO COME BACK TO IT REPEATEDLY. After discussing your initial differential, you will then ask questions to gather more information about the HPI, PMH, Meds, S H, FH, PE, etc. Ask all the questions, then we will give you some available answers. We will give you any information you ask for but will not give you information that you do not ask for. Ask specific questions (this applies for both the oral and wri tten OCRAs): For example: Ask specifically rather \"any urinary symptoms\". Do not ask \"Any associated symptoms?\". This is not specific - patients would not understand what you mean, and in the OCRAs, you will mi ss out on points. Ask specifically about \"Any history of heart disease?\" rather than \"any PMH?\" Some of the history and physical you ask for may not be available. It should be factored into your clinical reasoning as \"unavailable data\", not as \"noncontri butory\". After you have given a differential diagnosis, and gathered a history and Pex, we will discuss your initial evaluation of the patient. We will end with you telling us your leading diagnosis, what data you have that supports your leading diagnosi s and discuss any initial management steps you want to take with your patients. Throughout this assessment, be sure to tell us WHY you suggest whatever you suggest. ORAL ONLY: At any time, you can always go back and ask for more information (history/PE) about the patient. ORAL ONLY: Please go ahead and read the first page of the exam. We will start asking questions in 3 minutes. 28 Directly Observed FOCUSED H and P Assessment Objectives linked to this assessment: Demonstrate use of patient -centered interviewing and communication techniques Take a clinical history that demonstrates both organization and clinical reasoning Perform accurate and relevant physical exam techniques Demonstrate a compassionate and patient -sensitive approach to history -taking and physical examinations Demonstrate a fund of knowledge in the clinical discipline and apply this to patient care These link to the following clerkship learning objectives: I. Use proper technique to perform an accurate, appropriately detailed and organized history and physical examination in an efficient and sensitive manner Process for the Directly Observed Focused H and P Assessment Each student will be assigned a clerkship faculty who will contact them to set up a time to observe them take a brief, FOCUSED History and Physical Exam from a patient on the wards. This formal evaluation will be done by core clerkship faculty. This evaluation will take place during the 4 -8th week of the clerkship, unless extenuating circumstances do not allow. The Focused H and P will be scored from 0 -100 (based on a grading rubric) and will in total be 3% of the final grade. Failure to meet the expe ctations of this assessment will result in a reduction in the student's score, and possible failure of the Focused H and P component. Fail Directly Observed Focused H and P Assessment - If the student fails only this component of the clerkship, the stude nt must repeat the assessment. If the student fails a 2nd time, the student may fail the clerkship and have to retake the clerkship in its entirety. To best prepare for the Directly Observed Focused H and P Assessment: Observe residents and faculty and ge t observed by residents and faculty interviewing and examining patients (use the FOCUS forms) during your Medicine Clerkship. Roles and Responsibilities Each clerkship is directed by the School's Clerkship Director who oversees all clerkship sites. Each cl inical site is directed by a clerkship site director who ensures that students are appropriately supervised and faculty and residents are prepared to teach at their site. Clerkships also have multiple clinical faculty that have varying degrees of exposure to students. The responsibilities of the directors and coordinators are described below more specific ally. Clerkship directors are assisted by assistant clerkship directors, clerkship site directors , and clerkship coordinators. 29 School's Clerkship & Assistant Clerkship Director Oversee s the clerkship

director Create and maintain an appropriate learning environment, modeling respectful and professional behaviors for and toward students Assess students objectively using the CSEF form Supplementary Teaching/Supervision Expectations for Residents - Department of Medicine The Resident ensures that 3rd year students have meaningful involvement in patient care and learning by: Setting expectations and supervising the student Leading effective Work Rounds and overseeing clinical care during the day that integrates the student into the team and provides multiple opportunities for meaningful involvement in patient care and learning by delegating incr easing levels of responsibility Helps in coordinating the conduct of daily 'CHECK -INS' in which the student should come with: An organized update on pertinent patient information Interpretation of the information Management recommendations (hopefully) Ques tions Check -ins provide opportunities to provide instruction (specifically to ask questions, observe) and feedback. Delivering excellent teaching by providing clinical supervision during the day and during dedicated student teaching time (e.g., 20 + minut es >2 x /week with students to discuss a 'case', critique a presentation, go to bedside...), that emphasizes: Setting expectations Integrating the clerkship expectations and your own style and preferences - teams are encouraged to use Team Based Orientation tool in passport Providing multiple brief observations of the student doing elements of the history/exam, Pex, etc. and able to assist student in completing passport exercises Providing frequent, timely positive and constructive Feedback (and more feedback) and evaluation (on MedHub ) using \"Ask -Tell-Ask\" and the MedHub CSEF frameworks Identifying learning or professional difficulties and questions, and communicate them early to the student education leadership Supervision Initially, the primary clinical faculty members should designate time to observe you performing: history taking, focused physical exam, clinical problem -solving and interaction with patients and patient educati on. 33 Once the supervisor establishes the student's level of confidence and competency, the student should be delegated increasing levels of responsibility in patient care, as appropriate. Although students may initiate a particular patient encounter on thei r own and without direct supervision, the faculty must at some point review the encounter with the student and inform the patient in -person that the student's assessment and management plan has been reviewed and approved by the faculty. The faculty is ulti mately responsible for the evaluation, treatment, management, and documentation of patient care. If students have concerns regarding their clinical supervision, the site director and clerkship director should be immediately notified. Any supervision concer ns should also be immediately submitted through the ATM link or directly to the Associate Dean of Medical Education. Supervision and Delegating Increasing Levels of Responsibility It is expected that the level of student responsibility and supervision will be commensurate with student's competency and level of confidence. When the student arrives to a new setting, a faculty may wish to observe you for the first session. Thereafter, you should begin to see patients on your own. In the outpatient setting, the student should initially perform 4 -5 focused visits per day in the first week, increasing to 6 -12 thereafter. In the inpatient setting, the student should initially follow 1 -2 pa tients and increased to 3 -4 thereafter. When a student feels that they are being asked to perform beyond their level of confidence or competency, it is the responsibility of the student to promptly inform the preceptor. It is then the preceptor's respons ibility to constructively address the student's concerns and appropriately restructure the teaching encounter to address the student's learning needs. Under no circumstances should the following occur : Patient leaves the office/hospital with out having had a direct face -to-face encounter with clinical faculty/ supervising resident. Primary faculty gives \"prior approval\" for student to perform intervention (order labs, prescribe meds) without satisfactory review. Patient leaves office/hospital without being informed that assessment/ management plan has been directly reviewed and approved by the faculty. Learning in which a student is expected to perform an intervention or encounter without the prerequisite training and/or adequate supervision. Student note provides the only record of the visit. Although all faculty see all patients, faculty must document that they were actually the person responsible for seeing and examining the patient. Intimate Exam Policy Students participating in an intim ate exam with a patient (which includes, pelvic, genitourinary and rectal exam) must have a chaperone with them, irrespective of the gender of the patient or the student. Permission to participate in an intimate exam must be obtained by the supervisor in a dvance of the examination itself. The patient has the right to decline student attendance at any examination. If a student is unable to perform any intimate exam due to patient preference, the student's evaluation will not be impacted and if necessary , the clerkship director will provide an alternative experience. Physical Exam Demonstrations The demonstration of the physical examination on students should not be done by any supervisor of students including residents and attending faculty. Practicing the physical examination on students places them in a position where they may feel pressure to consent to something they may not feel comfortable with. 34 Third Year Student The 3rd year student: Learns through meaningful involvement in patient car e and learning with graduated decision -making responsibility Is available to help the team, but \"Learning comes first\" Is a proactive, self -directed learner Learns through meaningful involvement in patient care and learning/teaching with graduated decision - making responsibility . Sees patients independently Pre-rounds and initiates discussion with assigned patients on work rounds Formally presents assigned patients each day on work rounds Enters patient orders under the supervision of physi cians Follows -up on labs, imaging, consults Updates intern, team and patient (CHECK -IN with team members, see above) as new information emerges Speaks with consultants Provides initial write -up & daily progress notes Admits ~1 -3 new patients per week (ideally new admissions and not transfers from ICU), of which at least 1 patient/week is \"truly new \" (i.e., admitted from the ED or office/clinic; transfer patients and patients initially admitted by night float do not count as \"truly new\") Provides brief, ta rgeted topic presentations to the team on a regular (at least weekly) basis Learns from own patients first but also from all patients on the team Participates in discharge planning on patients you directly follow but do not do discharge summaries! The 3rd year student is available to help the team, but learning comes first. Learning from direct patient care is complemented by: Attending conferences and small group learning sessions Observing procedures Reading (at night and during slow periods on some days). The 3rd year student is a proactive, self -directed learner who: Elicits and clarifies expectations from your interns, resident, and attendings Addresses questions, concerns, confusion with the team or with your CD or site directors ASAP Identifies your learning needs and acts upon them Solicits feedback from your teachers Contacts your Clerkship Director with questions, comments or concerns early Adapts to team transitions and realities See Requirements in the Assignment section of this Syllabus for a listing of responsibilities. 35 Professional Comportment Students are expected to adhere to the AAMC -developed guidelines regarding Teacher -Learner Expectations, located on the Policies page, under \"Academic Policies and Information\" (http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/files/2015/05/AAMC -Teacher -Learner -Expectations.pdf ) Students are expected to be aware of and follow the site expectations on professional c omportment, including, but not limited to, dress code and the use of phones, pagers, and laptops. Students must arrive on time at their site and for any scheduled sessions. Any missed sessions and absences must adhere to the Attendance & Time Off Policy. Further, below are expectations for student professional conduct and behavior in the core clerkship curriculum . These include, but are not limited to: Treat ing and communicating with the clerkship team in a respectful manner . Engag ing in the core curricu lum and participating respectfully with peers and colleagues at all times . Arriving at clerkship didactic sessions on time and being present throughout sessions. Requesting faculty and resident evaluation s in a timely manner . Review ing and respond ing to e-mail requests in a timely manner . Return ing borrowed clerkship materials on time . Hand ing in all assignments on time . Complet ing all logs and FOCuS forms by the clerkship specific deadline . Inform ing clerkship leadership and supervising faculty/residents of absences in advance of the absence. Professional conduct will be reviewed at the mid -clerkship feedback session . Additionally, students will be given feedback prior to receiving their final grade when professionalism concerns are identified on the clerkship . If students are not meeting expectations for professional conduct and behavior in the clerkship or there are concerns , students will be made aware of the concerns noted by the clerkship directors, clerkship coordinator, faculty or residents. Ethical Behavior for Examinations and Mandatory Sessions Refrain from any conversation with your peers during exams and as you leave the L -11 testing space (when applic able) , including within the vending room and elevator waiting area , until you are on the elevator. Refrain from leaving your computer camera view at any point during the examination. Any time where a student cannot be viewed may result in failure of the examination. Don't seek or receive copies of the examinations Signing in classmates , or signing in yourself and not staying for mandatory sessions is considered cheating and violations will be referred to Medical Student Disciplinary Committee If you a re aware of any violations of the ethical standards listed above, within the Student Disciplinary Code of Academic and Professional Conduct, or otherwise, report it to the Clerkship Director Student Evaluation of the Clerkship Student feedback is a highly valued, critical resource for helping us contin ually improve our curriculum. Evaluation of learning experiences is a requirement of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. To ensure 36 that we have a representative amount of data on our courses and clerks hips, all students are expected to complete an evaluation via the School of Medicine's evaluation system, MedHub ( https://bu.medhub.com/ ), for each of the courses/ modules and their instructors. All evaluations are ano nymous and aggregate data is only released to clerkship directors after grades have been submitted for the blocks. Please comment freely and honestly about your experience. Blackboard Students will have access to a Blackboard site for the clerkship. The si te is listed under \"My Courses\" as MS310 A1: Medicine 1 Clerkship on your Blackboard landing page.

To log the patient encounter, stude nts must have participated in the history, physical exam, assessment and plan development of the patient. Required Patient Encounters (The Core) http://www.bumc.bu. edu/busm/education/medical -education/faculty -resources/ 37 Students should log every time they see any patient with the required patient encounter and continue to log throughout all clerkships . Clerkship/Clinical discipline Patient type/ Clinical condition Clinical setting Level of student responsibility* Internal Medicine Fever I All Internal Medicine Low blood pressure I All Internal Medicine The hospitalized patient with chest pain I All Internal Medicine Shortness of breath I All Internal Medicine Lab abnormalities (glucose, acid -base, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, hemoglobin) I All Internal Medicine Palpitations I All Internal Medicine Extremity pain/swelling I All Internal Medicine The hospitalized patient with chronic kidney disease I All Internal Medicine The hospitalized patient with congestive heart failure I All Internal Medicine The hospitalized patient with COPD/emphysema I All Each student is expected to \"see\" > 15 patients where you serve as the primary student actively caring for the patient, writing notes... (under the guidance of faculty and house staff). Included among the patients you must see are patients with each of the f ollowing \"Big 10\" active problems: Fever Low Blood Pressure The hospitalized patient with best pain Shortness of breath Lab abnormalities (glucose, acid -base, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, hemoglobin) Palpitations Extremity Pain/Swelling The hospitalized patient with chronic kidney disease The hospitalized patient with congestive heart failure The hospitalized patient with COPD/emphysema See \"Patient Encounters Log\" section for details on documenting required patient encounters. Strongly Rec ommended Experiences In addition to the requirements described above, it is strongly recommended that you care for patients with the attributes or conditions described below, and address the recommendations regarding patient education/counseling, prevention, systems and patient safety and procedures. Socio -demographics Elderly patient - > 75 years of age A patient who does not speak English 38 A patient with limited access to care A patient from a culture not your own Patient Education/Counseling - Perform the following patient education/counseling interactions as clinically indicated on patients you follow. Provide discharge instructions Promote behavioral change (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, other substance use, diet, weight loss, exercise) Facilitate medication adherence End of Life and Advance Directives Discussions. Join your attending, resident or t he Palliative Care Service to observe and participate in these crucial and powerful discussions with the patient and family in which, through partnership, decisions are made that integrate patient prognosis with patient values, priorities and wishes, to guide care in very ill patients who are near the end of their lives. Prevention (primary, secondary or tertiary) /health promotion as a major focus of the interaction. Address an issue of prevention with the patients you follow. Prevention interventions may overlap with the patient education/counseling described above. Systems and Patient Safety Identify instances where systems problems or strengths may have impacted on the quality of care your patients received Propose ways to improve the microsystems of ca re with which you interact Educate your patient on their major condition and the key medications you are asking them to take Procedures you may observe: Observe the following procedures listed below, describe the experience from the patient's perspective, and interpret and apply the results to the patient. **Of note, during the COVID -19 pandemic, you may have to wear an N95 for select procedures. Please consult your supervisors to clarify. Thoracentes is Paracentesis Lumbar puncture Cardiac stress test Echocardiogram Cardiac catheterization GI endoscopy Bronchoscopy Wound care In addition, for each of the procedures listed above you should aim to describe : The information it can provide Benefits and ri sks 39 Indications/Contraindications Potential complications and how to reduce the risk of the complications Alternative Patient Encounters If you do not see a patient with one of the required characteristics noted above, you are expected to speak with your Clerkship Director to identify a \"real\" or \"virtual\" patient learning opportunity to meet this Clerkship expectation. If a student has not been able to experience all patient encounters required for the clerkship, students must address any gaps in their patient encounters through an alternative experience. In this clerkship, the alternative experiences are virtual patients, which may come from the Clinical Program Solving cases or other paper or electronic sources approved by the Clerkship Director. Patient Encounter Log Students are expected to log their patient encounters in MedHub (https://bu.medhub.com/ ). Patient logs help the clerkship ensure that each student is seeing a diagnostically diverse patient population, an adequate number of patients, and performing a sufficient number of required procedures and diagnoses. Students must bring a printed copy of their patient encounter and procedure log to their mid rotation feedback meeting. Policies and Procedures for Evaluation, Grading and Promotion of Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine MD Students http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/faculty/evaluation -grading -assessment - system/ Student Disciplinary Academic Professional Conduct http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/faculty/medical -student -disciplinary -code/ Attendance Policies On-site hours must be limited to 80 hours per week, ave raged over a two -week period. Violations should be reported directly to the clerkship director or to an Associate Dean ( Medical Education or Student Affairs). As part of becoming a professional, medical student s should have the flexibility to address perso nal and professional needs at their discretion. In the clerkship year, as students transition to more of a professional work environment, they gain the responsibility of a working professional, yet do not have the agency to attend to their personal needs. As such, the Student Affairs Office and Medical Education Office have developed this personal day policy in conjunction with the clerkship directors for the core clerkship year. In addition to addressing issues of wellness and professional development, thi s policy will teach students the importance of time management and managing days off. Time off requests must comply with the Attendance & Time Off Policy. Attendance & Time Off Policy: http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/education/medical - education/policies/attendance -time -off-policy/ 40 o 3rd Blackout Dates Students cannot take personal days under the following circumstances: The first day on a new team or at a new site (this includes 1st and 2nd day of rotation due to clerkship and site orientation and the 1st day of Week 5) Any day of the 8th week. This is a really limited timeframe when students will be 1) Completing final assessments including OCRAs and Directly Observed H and P assessments, and 2) Reading days and final assessments including the Written OCRA and the Medicine shelf exam are assigned during these times. Due to these and other obligations, the students will already have limited face -time with their teams. Additional scheduled absences, such as personal days, will significantly limit preceptors' abilities to complete student CSEF assessments . Scrubs Policy http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/education/medical -education/policies/scrubs -policy/ School of Medicine Policies In addition to the expectations listed above, all students are expected to adhere to Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and Boston University policies. http://www.bumc. bu.edu/busm/education/medical -education/policies/ BU Policies and Student Support Services Appropriate Treatment in Medicine Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine is committed to providing a work and educational environment that is con ducive to teaching and learning, research, the practice of medicine and patient care.
