They published their findings online July 20, 2015, in JAMA Pediatrics , after studying census tract data and hospitalization records. Researchers believe that identifying hotspot geographic areas can help doctors predict which children are at greater risk of hospitalization and intervene, at a reduced cost, through patient- and population-level manage - ment of acute conditions.The study, led by pediatrician Andrew Beck, MD, looked at children hospitalized for bron - chiolitis or pneumonia at Cincinnati Children's between 2010 and 2013. Those hospitalized with bronchiolitis were younger than 2, those with pneumonia younger than 18. Patients were identified using discharge diagnosis codes, then geocoded to their home census tract. The findings showed great disparities based largely on where children lived. \"The most-hospitalized group with bron - chiolitis had a hospitalization rate six times that of the least hospitalized,\" says Beck. \"Those most hospitalized with pneumonia had a hospitalization rate 11 times that of the least hospitalized.\" Todd Florin, MD, who co-authored the study with Beck, adds, \"The inequalities were associated with underlying differences in socioeconomic measures and were clustered geographically, with hospitalization hot spots in the inner city and cold spots in outlying suburbs.\" Findings were similar to a 2013 Cincinnati Children's study of asthma hospitalization dem - onstrating that rates varied 18-fold across local neighborhoods. The neighborhoods in the new JAMA Pediatrics study often overlapped those in the asthma study. \"This has substantial clinical and public health implications, suggesting small areas that could be targets for prevention and cost containment,\" says Florin. Andrew Beck, MD. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 7NEW & NOTEWORTHY Researchers at Cincinnati Children's have found that using general anesthesia during surgery in children younger than age 4 could have damaging effects on language compre - hension and IQ. Their findings, published July 8, 2015, in Pediatrics , are spurring work to lessen an - esthesia's effects and to understand how the drugs affect brain function and composition. \"We have to better understand to what extent anesthetics and other factors contribute to learning abnormalities in children before making drastic changes to our current prac - tice, which by all measures has become very safe,\" says Andreas Loepke, MD, PhD, FAAP , anesthesiologist at Cincinnati Children's and the study's lead author. Loepke and his colleagues pursued the study after finding evidence of neurocognitive impairment in mice exposed to general anes - thesia. Those previously published studies raised the researchers' concerns about similar effects in young children. The Pediatrics study compared language study scores of 106 children, ages 5 to 18. Half had not had surgery, and half had surgery before age 4. Children exposed to anesthesia scored significantly lower in listening comprehension and performance IQ. Age, gender, socioeco - nomic status, and the types of surgeries and length of anesthetic exposure were factored into the calculations. Although Loepke and his team are conducting laboratory studies into alterna - tive anesthetic methods, they emphasize that current practices are quite safe \u2014 particu - larly when viewed in the context of life-saving procedures. \"The ultimate goal of our research is to improve safety and outcomes in young children who have no choice but to undergo surgery with anesthesia,\" he says. Anesthesia Can Damage IQ Andreas Loepke, MD, PhD. Arthritis Drug Shows Promise for Rare Immune DisorderAbatacept, a drug already approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has shown promise in treating children with LRBA deficiency, a debili - tating genetic immune disorder. Michael Jordan, MD, Division of Immunobi - ology at Cincinnati Children's, was senior author of the study, which involved researchers from around the country. The findings were reported in the July 2015 issue of Science . Lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige- like anchor (LRBA), is a gene essential for the normal function of the immune system. Muta - tions in the gene cause immunodeficiencies and autoimmune disorders, including one known as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). For the study, six patients with CVID took abatacept for periods up to eight years. The study found, \"... patients with LRBA deficiency manifested a dramatic and sustained improve - ment in response to abatacept.\" Abatacept appeared to regulate the inhibi - tory immune receptor CTLA4. Normally, CTLA4 is expressed on the cell surface, where it prevents autoimmune activation. Patients with CVID cannot replace CTLA4 on the cell surface. Because CTLA4 dysfunction is also present in RA, researchers suspected that abata - cept might also work to treat LRBA deficiency. Besides improving patients' lung disease, the drug also appeared to decrease infection risk. Researchers plan to continue exploring the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Michael Jordan, MD . 8 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015NEW & NOTEWORTHY Pesticide Linked to ADHD A commonly used household pesticide could initiate or aggravate attention deficit hyperactiv - ity disorder (ADHD) in some children. The finding, reported by Cincinnati Chil - dren's researchers and published online in En- vironmental Health in May, 2015, found that pyrethroid pesticide exposure increased hyper - activity and impulsivity, particularly in boys with ADHD. Pyrethroids have been used increasingly since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agen - cy banned organophosphate pesticides from residential use in 2000. Pyrethroids are now the most commonly used for residential and public health pest control. \"Given the growing use of pyrethroid pes - ticides and the perception that they may rep - resent a safe alternative, our findings may be of considerable public health importance,\" says Tanya Froehlich, MD, a developmental pedia - trician at Cincinnati Children's and the study's corresponding author. Although considered safer than the banned organophosphates, pyrethroid exposure in ani - mal studies has shown increased hyperactivity, impulsivity and abnormalities in the dopamine system of male mice. Dopamine is a brain neu - rochemical involved in many activities, including ADHD. The researchers studied data on 687 chil - dren ages 8 to 15, taken from a 2000-2001 national health survey. The survey included in - formation on children's ADHD symptoms and urine samples testing for the pesticide exposure biomarker 3-PBA. Boys with detectable 3-PBA were three times as likely to have ADHD than those without the biomarker. Hyperactivity and impulsivity increased by 50 percent for every tenfold increase in 3-PBA levels in boys. Bio - markers in girls did not correlate with increased ADHD. Although the findings are significant, Froehlich cautions that further study is needed to determine their implications for public health. \"Given that pyrethroids are non-persistent and rapidly metabolized, measurements over time would provide a more accurate assess - ment of typical exposure,\" she says. Tanya Froehlich, MD . CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 9NEW & NOTEWORTHY High density lipoproteins (HDL) have long been recognized as the \"good\" cholesterol that helps protect against cardiovascular disease. But genomic studies have revealed that HDL has a much more complex composition and function than previously understood. Researchers from Cincinnati Children's and the University of Cincinnati report discovering 38 new HDL subparticles in an effort they hope will allow more precisely targeted treatments for cardiovascular disease. Led by Long (Jason) Lu, PhD, Division of Bioinformatics at Cincinnati Children's, the scientists published their find - ings in the August 2015 Journal of Proteome Research . In what they termed the \"first report that employs a network-based approach to systematically infer HDL subspecies,\" the scientists used genomic and computational analyses to identify the subparticles, backed by human plasma studies and gene knockout experiments in mice. The study contributes significantly to a growing understanding that HDL serves as much more than a mechanism for whisking lipids from the body. Their findings, the authors state, \"leave little doubt that HDL is not only involved in lipid transport, but also proteinase inhibition, anti-inflammation, complement regulation, and innate immunity.\" Future work will aim to further isolate and characterize the subparticles biochemically as a step toward developing targeted tests and treatments that combat cardiovascular disease.HDL Subparticles Offer New Targets for Drug Development Long (Jason) Lu, PhD. Researchers who want to better understand lung development have a new, free resource at their fingertips: LungGENS (Lung Gene Expres - sion iN Single-cell). LungGENS is a web-based tool that maps single-cell gene expression. Yan Xu, PhD, Di- vision of Biomedical Informatics at Cincinnati Children's, and her team developed the tool to help researchers access and visualize complex single-cell transcriptomic data. A report of their achievement was recently published in the jour - nal Thorax . Scientists can search the tool by gene or cell type. If a researcher enters a gene symbol or a list of genes, the tool provides quantitative RNA expression of the gene of interest in each lung cell type. A cell type query returns associ - ated gene signatures and genes encoding cell surface markers as well as transcription factors in interactive heatmap and tables. Xu and her colleagues hope that greater understanding of individual lung cell types and the ways they interact to form the lung may lead to better treatments in such areas as respi - ratory distress syndrome in premature infants.New, Free Tool Maps Genetic Landscape of the Lung Yan Xu, PhD . LungGENS is freely available for non- commercial use at https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/ lunggens/default.html. 10 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015Maxing out the inherently stressed nature of treatment-resistant breast cancer cells may thwart their ability to find genetic workarounds to treatment, a new study shows. \"We present an alternative strategy for cancer treatment, which is removing cancer cells' defenses against their own intrinsic stress,\" says Kakajan Komurov, PhD, lead author and researcher in the Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute. \"Our findings highlight the feasibility of maximizing cell stress by inhibiting adaptive pathways to cause cell death.\" Findings were published May 26, 2015, in Science Signaling . The team focused on an especially hard-to-treat form of breast cancer driven by the HER2-mTOR molecular pathway. Standard treatment for the cancer is combina - tion chemotherapy, including an agent that spe - cifically targets the HER2 gene. But more than half the cases resist the treatment, and the dis - ease progresses. For this study, researchers used in vitro experimentation with human breast cancer cell lines and extensive computer analysis of genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium. They searched for non-oncogenic vulner - abilities in breast cancers that overexpress the ERBB2 gene. The authors found that cancers overexpressing ERBB2 have an important survival mechanism for HER2 cancer cells \u2014 the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway, or ERAD. Researchers then tested a combination treatment that genetically deletes or pharmaco - logically inhibits ERAD. The treatment killed the HER2-positive breast cancer cells. They are now testing the experimental regimen in mouse models and plan to begin testing an experimental cancer drug that blocks a component of the ERAD pathway.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Stressing Out Breast Cancer Kakajan Komurov, PhD. IL-9-producing mucosal mast cells (MMC9 cells) play a key role in amplifying allergic response to ingested food, according to new research. The study, led by Yui-Hsi Wang, PhD , a researcher in the Division of Allergy and Immunology, was published Sept. 22, 2015 in the journal Immunity . The findings, based on data from mouse models, eventually could lead to a blood test to identify children at highest risk of severe food allergies. The authors say MMC9 cells produce large amounts of interlukin 9 (IL-9), which amplifies anaphylactic shock response. Prior to this study, the key cellular source of IL-9 was unknown. \"Our study suggests that although you need to have some level of IgE to trigger a food allergy response, you also have to produce MMC9 cells to get a severe response and anaphylaxis,\" Wang says. \"Without these cells you will not get severe food allergies.\"Muscosal Mast Cells Play Role in Severe Allergic Reactions Yui-Hsi Wang, PhD. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 11Beginning the End of Cystic Fibrosis Just a few decades ago, adult cystic fibrosis (CF) was a mostly abstract concept. After all, most children born with one of the 1,900 known mutations of the CFTR gene were fortunate to reach their teen years. Now, thanks to dramatic and continuing improvements in treatment, living deeply into adulthood with CF is a reality. Reaching retirement age appears achievable. Experts at Cincinnati Children's are playing many leading roles in this emerging revolution. Scientists here contributed significantly to two important, recently approved CF drugs. They are making breakthroughs in imaging technology, developing new approaches to wellness education, and creating powerful learning networks that bring highly motivated parents together with far-flung researchers and physicians to accelerate discovery. 12 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 13As recently as 1980, most chil - dren born with cystic fibrosis (CF) could not expect to live long enough to legally buy a glass of wine. Now, growing numbers of CF sur - vivors can look forward to toasting their own retirements thanks to a wave of sci - entific breakthroughs that has begun to conquer a feared childhood killer. \"We are rapidly moving toward the day when people will live long, full lives and ultimately die with cystic fibrosis instead of dying prematurely of cystic fi - brosis,\" says John Clancy, MD, research director for the Division of Pulmonary Medicine at Cincinnati Children's. The advanced research and state- of-the-art treatment provided through the Cystic Fibrosis Center at Cincin - nati Children's are two of several reasons why U.S. News & World Report recently ranked the medical center as the nation's best for pediatric pulmonology. Cincin - nati Children's is one of only 10 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Research Centers in the United States and one of the first cen - ters to join the foundation's Therapeutics Development Network. Researchers here have supported CF drug discovery and development from the early days. Clancy has served in various research leadership roles with the CF Foundation and currently serves as chair of the NIH Rare Disease Research Network. He was a co-author of the seminal paper, published in 2010 in the New England Journal of Medicine , which unveiled the world's first medication proven to act upon the root causes of cystic fibrosis. Clancy's role in - cluded reviewing the blinded data for one of the key biomarkers in the study. That once experimental drug, VX- 770, became ivacaftor (now marketed as Kalydeco), which won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2012. This drug has a powerful effect on cystic fibrosis patients with a mutated version of the gene G551D-CFTR, and similar mutations. For these 5 percent to 7 per - cent of patients, the drug can restore lung function from near zero capacity to better than 50 percent of normal, Clancy says. Clancy also was lead author of the first published study of lumacaftor in CF patients, which became part of the new - est CF drug, which won FDA approval in July 2015. Dubbed Orkambi, this com - bination treatment (lumacaftor 200 mg/ ivacaftor 125 mg) is not quite as dramatic as Kalydeco as it increases lung function to about 15 percent of normal. However, the treatment works against the most common genetic cause of CF , those who have two copies of the F508del mutation. About 45 percent of the 30,000 people with CF in the United States have two copies of this gene mutation. \"Fifteen percent lung function is still a long way from normal, but that level of function can make it possible for many more people to survive much longer,\" Clancy says. \"More importantly for survival, the clinical trial showed a 40 percent decrease in pulmonary exacerba - tions. For many CF patients, these epi - sodes of inflammation and infection have become leading predictors of lung func - tion decline and death.\" As important as the two new drugs may be, even more treatments are coming. ANOTHER 1900 MUTATIONS TO GO Now the race is on to develop more med - ications to address all of the emerging classes of CF patients. Some of those ad - vances will likely be based upon the work of a research team led by Anjaparavanda Naren, PhD, co-director of the Cystic Fi - brosis Research Center.The Revolution is Here for Cystic Fibrosis With two FDA-approved drugs on the market and several more in the pipeline, expectations of long-term survival run high as an era of personalized medicine begins by Tim Bonfield 14 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015John Clancy, MD, Research Director for the Division of Pulmonary Medicine at Cincinnati Children's . CF has become a prime example of the potential power of personalized medi - cine, Naren says. Since the discovery of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane con - duct regulator gene (CFTR) in 1989, re - searchers have gone on to find more than 1,900 mutations of the gene. The sheer variety of mutations means that no single drug is likely to have a cure-all effect. In - stead, clinicians will need to build genetic profiles of each patient, and then tailor treatments accordingly. Clancy and Raouf Amin, MD, Di - rector of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine, recruited Naren to Cincinnati Children's in 2013. Now Naren works to expand the connections between CF- related mutations and drugs known to act upon them. Earlier this year, Naren and his re - search team, including Chang Suk Moon, PhD, and Kavisha Arora, PhD, reported finding an interplay between CFTR and multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4). In cystic fibrosis, chloride chan - nels on epithelial cells underperform, keeping fluids in the lungs. In diarrhea, the channel over-performs, releasing flu - ids into the intestines and bowel. The study was featured on the May 1, 2015, cover of The Journal of Biological Chemistry for two reasons. The chloride channel findings have potentially broad implications for controlling medication- induced diarrhea, an all-too-common therapy side effect for diseases far beyond cystic fibrosis. In addition, the model the scientists developed to conduct the study has its own implications. ENTER THE 'ENTEROID' Naren's team, in collaboration with Mi - chael Helmrath, MD, successfully devel - oped intestinal organoids he calls \"en - teroids,\" which were grown from stem cells obtained from tiny amounts of bi - opsy material. The enteroids functioned as living test platforms that allowed the team to evaluate the effects of drug expo - sures in real time. \"Until now, we did not have a good model system to study intestinal biop - sies, because the tissue samples that could be safely collected have been so small,\" Naren says. \"Now we have multiple ap - proaches.\" Enteroids like these will help acceler - ate cystic fibrosis drug development and the larger concept of genome-based per - sonal treatment. \"Enteroids allow us to use stem-cell techniques to develop a bet - ter index of chloride channel function, which gives us the kinds of tools we need to move into personalized medicine,\" Na - ren says. Cincinnati Children's has played a leading role in organoid research. James Wells, PhD, was among the first to suc - ceed at developing functional intestine and stomach tissues from induced plu - ripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Wells and Helmrath have collaborated to demon - strate a method to grow human organ - oids to much larger sizes in mice, which suggests that organoids created from a patient's own cells may be able to grow on their own once implanted. Naren has been working with both of these scientists to advance treatment for cystic fibrosis. \"One of the reasons I came to Cin - cinnati was the unique opportunity for collaboration here,\" Naren says. At Cincinnati Children's, Naren has gained greatly expanded access to human tissue samples and new opportunities to connect his once-isolated animal-based research directly to the human clinical trial pipeline. He has collaborated with experts in fields ranging from endocri - nology to bioinformatics. He also found the funding to build the customized CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 15equipment needed to obtain confocal microscope imagery of living enteroids in action. MEDICINE GETS PERSONAL Here, personalized medicine is no lon - ger an abstract goal; it is an expanding reality, Naren says. For example, he re - cently worked with Clancy and Gary Lewis McPhail, MD, the director of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine's Cys - tic Fibrosis Center, to successfully treat three CF children from the United Arab Emirates. The team determined through DNA sequence information that the children shared a specific S549N mutation of the CFTR gene. Naren was familiar with this mutation through previous research he published in 2012. The team agreed that this unusual CFTR mutation was similar enough to the G551D mutation affected by Kalydeco to believe the drug would help. Prescribed off-label, the daily drug regimen has worked. Within a month, sweat chloride levels for the children had dropped to near normal, FEV1 tests of lung capacity had improved, and their CF-driven insulin resistance had re - solved, Naren says. This is the personalized medicine revolution coming for children with cys - tic fibrosis, and eventually for children with all sorts of rare diseases, Naren says. T reatment flow will move from the pa - tient to the research lab then back to the patient. To carry out this kind of work, many medical centers will need to orga - nize new types of care teams. \"We can do the exome sequencing for an individual patient. We can devel - op an organoid based upon that patient's genomic profile. We can determine how that organoid responds to intervention and then choose the best treatment for that patient,\" Naren says. \"It is not com - mon to see all the specialized expertise needed to achieve this all in one place. It takes a whole series of researchers, specialist physicians, nurses, network analysts and other support personnel all working together to help an individual get better.\" <Two teens with cystic fibrosis (CF) blow into spirometers. Both tests come back with 100 per - cent scores on a key measure of lung capacity, the FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second). Both patients ap - pear to be doing well. Not necessarily. A closer look at the patients' lungs, using a new approach called ultrashort echo-time magnetic resonance imag - ing (UTE MRI), reveals striking structural differences in the lungs. Meanwhile, an MRI scan using hyperpolarized gas as a contrast agent reveals clear differences in lung function. Despite having similar FEV1 results, these MRI tests reveal that one patient is doing much worse than the oth - er, and likely needs prompt intervention. As recently as a few years ago, de - tecting such differences in lung function for children and young adults with cystic fibrosis had minimal practical value be - cause the menu of treatment interven - tions was so limited. Now, however, two new cystic fibrosis drugs have reached the market and several more are in devel - opment. Now, clinicians need to decide exactly when these exciting-but-expen - sive new treatments should be employed. \"We are right on the cusp of individu - alized medicine for cystic fibrosis. As new pharmaceutical agents continue to be developed, it becomes critical to obtain detailed data to assess which therapies are working best for particular patients,\" says Jason Woods, PhD, Director of the Center for Pulmonary Imaging Research at Cincinnati Children's. \"The FEV1 is a standard clinical test, but results can be widely variable.\"Twin Breakthroughs in CF Imaging Ultrashort echo-time, hyperpolarized gas MRI methods make it safer to assess new treatments by Tim Bonfield Anjaparavanda Naren, PhD, Co-Director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center and his research team, Chang Suk Moon, PhD, and Kavisha Arora, PhD. 16 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015Another well-established imaging method \u2014 CT scanning \u2014 also can pro - vide useful, detailed data on lung func - tion. However, a single CT scan delivers as much as 200 times more radiation than a standard chest X-ray. While the risks of triggering cancer later in life are small, those risks are real enough to make clini - cians reluctant to use CT scanning as a frequent surveillance tool, especially for the youngest CF patients. Enter the MRI. With improved tech - niques, MRI scanning can produce lung imagery that rivals the quality of a CT scan. In fact, UTE MRI in particular can be a safe and effective tool for evaluat - ing lung health in patients as young as six months. David Roach, PhD, (a fellow in Woods' lab) recently presented pilot study data about UTE MRI in Denver at the an - nual meeting of the American Thoracic Society. The findings also were published May 1, 2015, in the abstract issue of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine . Woods reports that UTE MRI can as - sess bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thick - ening, parenchymal opacity and air trap - ping. \"We show that MRI can detect the same abnormalities that can be detected with CT,\" he says. The next steps for wider adoption of UTE MRI include larger, multicenter clinical trials to confirm the pilot study findings. Meanwhile, Woods continues his work as a leading expert in the use of hyperpolarized-gas MRI. Cincinnati Children's is participating in stage II clini - cal trials to evaluate the use of Xenon-129 MRI scanning for cystic fibrosis patients. The noble gas can be tracked during breathing, which provides much more in - formation about lung function than can be obtained from the FEV1 test. Initial results from a study of hyper - polarized-gas MRI in CF patients will be presented by his group at the International Workshop on Pulmonary Functional Imaging in Edinburgh, Scotland, and at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in Phoenix. Woods sees the UTE and hyperpo - larized-gas methods as complementary tools that do not pose the radiation risk of CT scanning. Within the next several years, he predicts that new MRI tech - niques will be used well beyond the cystic fibrosis population to evaluate lung func - tion and development in premature infants and other children with rare lung diseases. Also, hospitals will not need to make major investments to adopt these tech - nologies, Woods says. Many clinical MRI scanners already have the software needed to support UTE MRI. The hyperpolarized- gas method does require equipment up - grades, but not entirely new scanners. < Jason Woods, PhD , is a leader in developing safer lung imaging methods for children. These images demonstrate the results of UTE MRI (top), hyperpolarized gas MRI (middle), and a colorized image that combines both results (bottom). CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 17Few people personify the power and potential of health care learning networks more than Erin Moore. Five years ago, Moore and her hus - band Martin were the proud, excited par - ents of a growing family. They were rais - ing a healthy 2-year-old girl named Ella, and the family had just expanded with the birth of their twins, Drew and Lily. Shortly after the twins were born came the sobering news: testing con - firmed that Drew had cystic fibrosis. From that moment, the course of Moore's life began to transform from business -woman and mother into full-time patient advocate. Now she is part of an effort at Cincinnati Children's to build a collabor - ative chronic care network (C3N) to ac - celerate research and share best practices in cystic fibrosis treatment. Moore's influence upon cystic fibro - sis care reaches to the national level. She chronicles her son's CF journey in a blog called 66 Roses. She has been interviewed by U.S. News & World Report and was recently invited to the White House to attend a \"Champions of Change\" event. She has served as an advisor to Genentech and the Robert Wood Johnson Founda -tion. She currently serves on a patient engagement committee of the Cystic Fi - brosis Foundation and as a patient repre - sentative with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Since 2013, Moore has been employed by Cincinnati Children's as a family partner, where she works with the pulmonary care team to design social media engagement strategies for patients and caregivers. \"Right after Drew was diagnosed with CF , I immediately felt 100,000 dif - ferent feelings,\" Moore wrote in a 2010 blog post. \"You're scared because you don't know what it is. You're sad because your baby is sick. You're guilty, know - ing that this genetic disease was passed onto your baby through you, and you wish more than anything that you could take that away. But then you look at your beautiful little being and can't help but be overwhelmed by love.\" Moore is a voracious learner and a dynamic builder; highly motivated, high - ly organized and ready to act. And like all strong mothers, she is utterly committed to the well-being of her son. Moore is ex - actly the type of parent who breathes life into the esoteric-sounding C3N concept.Empowering Networks One of the most powerful weapons against cystic fibrosis may be the s martphone by Tim Bonfield 18 RESEARCH HORIZONS / WINTER 2015\"The model is connecting a vast network of microexperts who are coming together to create something bigger than any one of us can create alone.\" 18 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015Cincinnati Children's has been a pioneer in developing learning networks that use so - cial networking technology to bring scientists, physicians, parents and patients together in new ways. Members of these networks pool ex - perimental data and real-world experiences to accelerate research, improve communication and spread best practices faster and farther than ever before. Peter Margolis, MD, PhD, Director of research at the James M. Anderson Center for Health Systems Excellence at Cincinnati Chil - dren's, was an instrumental force in launching the first major C3N \u2014 the ImproveCareNow network that focuses on Crohn's disease and ul - cerative colitis. Now Margolis is working with Moore, Michael Seid, PhD, Director of Health Outcomes and Quality of Care Research in the Division of Pulmonary Medicine, and several other colleagues at Cincinnati Children's to apply the C3N concept to transforming cystic fibrosis care. A NETWORK IS BORN Moore was among the early advocates who pushed to begin a C3N-style network for CF , while she was serving as the state advocacy chair of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Ohio. Her awareness of the approach began in 2012 after attending the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in Orlando. \"One of the key things I understood through that conference was that what's miss - ing in CF is a better understanding of what happens to patients between visits,\" Moore says. \"Well, I have that knowledge and so do the other 30,000 families who have kids with CF . So I started searching online for more in - formation. That's where I read about Dr. Seid and learned more about this chronic care mod - el, and I thought, 'This is what we need. This Erin Moore (below) has served as an advisor to Genentech and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. She currently serves on a patient engagement committee of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and as a patient representative with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 19is what they were talking about at that conference. Why don't we have this?'\" Moore convinced CF Foundation leaders to visit Cincinnati to learn first- hand about work led by Margolis and Seid. They were impressed. Now, Cincin - nati Children's, the CF Foundation and the Dartmouth Institute (a long-time adviser to the foundation) are collaborat - ing to build the \"CF Care Model of the Future.\" Initial design meetings were held in January and May. \"Through this process we're build - ing a new system. We're building a new way to work together,\" Moore says. \"The model is connecting a vast network of microexperts who are coming together to create something bigger than any one of us can create alone.\" Ideas for the care model include new emphasis on self-tracking metrics, home health care and telemedicine, shared de - cision making, even creating a centralized IRB for multicenter CF research. As the work progresses, Cincinnati Children's and other accredited CF care centers plan to launch pilot projects to evaluate new approaches. \"A lot of this is coming from families pushing ideas,\" Moore says. \"Families are saying, 'We demand better. We need this. We need you to work with us.'\" CONDUCTING CARE WITH A SMARTPHONE One part of the new care model could in - clude a new mobile application (app) un - der development by a team of researchers at Cincinnati Children's and the Califor - nia-based Vital Labs Inc. They are design - ing and testing a symptom tracking and communication tool called Orchestra to improve interactions between families and clinicians. Moore is one of the early adopters. The tool can be used on tablets, desk - tops and smartphones. It allows Moore to constantly feed data about Drew's health status to his care team. Every day, the app automatically sends out questions seek - ing information about symptoms, medi - cation usage, nutrition and other topics. Families respond with just a few key - strokes. \"It takes about 40 seconds a day to respond to the prompts,\" Moore says. New data points get plotted instant - ly into tracking charts, and if desired, the app can alert clinicians to abnormal trends. The app's design team \u2014 Lisa Opipari-Arrigan, PhD, and Heather Ka - plan, MD, at Cincinnati Children's and Ian Eslick, PhD, at Vital Labs \u2014 ex - plained the app during a webinar record - ed in April 2015. In a typical chronic care scenario, families meet with clinicians for about 20 minutes per visit, three or four times a year. Everything else about the patient's health experience occurs in the weeks and months between. However, information about what happened during those time Caring for their son Drew (left) is a non-stop duty for the Moore family, but improving treatments and staying in constant contact with their care team has allowed Drew to enjoy a normal, active life with his siblings (center). 20 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015spans usually gets relayed to clinicians in unobjective, incomplete fashion, all col - ored by the limitations of memory. Orchestra can help fill in the gaps, the designers say. When families use the tracking app, patients and parents come to the clinic visit armed with much more comprehensive data, which makes the limited time they share with doctors more meaningful and effective. \"The platform enables patients and providers to be equal partners, co-pro - ducing health and health care together,\" Opipari-Arrigan says. Moore says the system empowers families. She recalls a situation when Drew was 4 and he started coughing more frequently during a family vacation. Doctors in the local hospital's emergency room wanted to admit Drew for a 10-day course of antibiotics. However, Moore could see from the data she had been gathering that Drew was not acting like he had during previous infection-related exacerbations. She doubted that antibiot - ics would help. Her information was sol - id enough that she convinced the doctors to administer a steroid instead, and Drew was back to normal within a day. \"Doctors are coming to realize that I have more knowledge about Drew than anybody else. I'm with him every day,\" Moore says. \"Now our clinicians engage with me where I'm at, not where they're at.\" A BRIGHTER FUTURE These days, Drew is doing well. He started kindergarten this year and loves to romp around with his older sister Ella, twin sis - ter Lily, and younger brother, Jake. Drew is the only one of the children with CF; the others are carriers. Three times a day, 30 minutes per session, Drew wears a vibrating vest to help clear mucus from his lungs while breathing medicated mist through a nebulizer. The rest of his medications fill a kitchen cabinet. \"I credit a lot of Drew's health to the pulmonary team at Cincinnati Chil - dren's. They have been terrific,\" Moore says. \"But I also credit a lot of it to the advocacy, engagement and empowerment that I have. It really has been a partner - ship.\" Moore plans to continue putting the Orchestra app through its paces and to continue advocating for family empow - erment and engagement. She sees a huge role for social networking as the CF Care Model of the Future embraces personal - ized medicine. Moore points to her smartphone and says, \"This will transform health care.\" < Erin Moore uses an app called Orchestra, under development at Cincinnati Children's, to submit and track data about Drew's condition. Daily data entry requires just seconds to complete and unusual blips can be automatically flagged. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 21Better sleep. Reduced stress. Improved fitness. Support for school performance. These prescriptions for improving day-to-day life may have as deep an im - pact upon health outcomes for children and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) as the introduction of new medications. So says the leader of the new Cystic Fibrosis Learning and Education Center at Cincinnati Children's. Thomas Boat, MD, recently re - turned to the medical center after serving as Dean of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Boat's long career includes extensive experience in CF care and in supporting CF research. Now he is coordinating an effort involving fac - ulty and staff from Cincinnati Children's and UC Health's CF Center to create and adopt innovative concepts in cystic fi - brosis care. \"This is a frontal assault on the so - cial, behavioral and economic dimen - sions of cystic fibrosis,\" Boat says. \"It is certainly very exciting to see new medica - tions and new technologies coming along for individuals with CF . But if families struggle to manage the basic aspects of their lives, these new developments won't make as much difference as they could. The ability of parents and patients to manage their own care is 95 percent of the game, and we don't know how best to meet this challenge.\" One of the new learning center's missions is to prepare health profession - als for a new era in CF care, an era in which many more children with CF will survive long into adulthood. Initial funding comes from the Boomer Esiason Foundation, the charity launched by the former NFL quarterback whose 24-year- old son Gunnar has cystic fibrosis. Since 1993, the foundation has raised more than $100 million for CF research, schol - arships and other support. Through the new learning center, Boat says the CF program at Cincinnati Children's will serve as an incubator for launching and evaluating more compre - hensive promotion of health and well - ness. The most successful ideas will be shared across a national network of CF care centers accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. CF Learning and Education Center to Emphasize Novel Approaches to Health and Wellness by Tim Bonfield \"The ability of parents and patients to manage their own care is 95 percent of the game, and we don't know how best to meet this challenge.\" 22 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015\"One of our first focus areas will be sleep,\" Boat says. \"It is well known that kids with CF , much like others with com - plex chronic disease, do not sleep as well or as much as healthier kids. Interestingly, their parents don't either.\" Studies conducted at Cincinnati Children's and other research centers have confirmed that lack of sleep is linked to faster disease progression and declining pulmonary function for children with CF . The harder step is finding effective ways to help children get the sleep they need, Boat says. \"A lot of the adherence issues in CF have to do with the fact that routine care takes two or more hours every day,\" Boat says. \"That's in addition to the frequent medical visits, plus taking care of the sib - lings, getting them to school, getting to work, and doing all the other things fam - ilies have to do. It is no surprise that so many parents and patients think or even say, 'I'm whipped. I'm burned out.'\" Unrelenting stress takes a big toll. Another major effort of the center will study the ability of stress reduction techniques to improve the quality of life for CF families. CF health professionals will likely also benefit. The first sleep and stress manage - ment initiatives will roll out this fall, Boat says. Longer term, the center also is studying how it can be more effective at supporting the educational needs of chil - dren with CF . \"We know that school success is a huge resilience factor,\" Boat says. \"The kids who do better in school also tend to do better emotionally, and they are like - ly to do better managing their therapy. School success also promotes economic and social stability in adulthood, an im - portant outcome for CF patients, many of whom we predict will become older adults.\" Unlike 30 years ago, many more children with CF are growing up healthy enough to lead productive adult lives. Many will want to go to college. Many will need to work. All this makes it in - creasingly important that small children with CF are prepared for success when they reach school age, Boat says.The new CF learning center plans to tap into wide-ranging expertise at Cincinnati Children's in complex chronic care, adherence research, sleep disorders, behavioral health and more. The project includes specialists from the UC College of Medicine in sleep medicine, integra - tive medicine and other fields. Boat also envisions involving a variety of commu - nity organizations along the way. A platform for planning and program development within the CF Learning and Education Center will use information technology to create communication \"ex - changes\" that connect and encourage the contribution of ideas from CF families, health professionals, and others, both here in Cincinnati and ultimately from a national or even global network of the CF Center. \"Our first steps, however, need to raise awareness among CF health profes - sionals,\" Boat says. \"Because if they don't buy in, they won't be as effective at help - ing families.\" < Thomas Boat, MD, (left) leads development of the new Cystic Fibrosis Learning and Education Center at Cincinnati Children's.

CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 23The Division of Pulmonary Medicine at Cincinnati Children's collaborates on a wide range of research projects, including computer-generated \"virtual surgery\" techniques that could one day transform surgical treatment of sleep apnea. Their unusual secret weapon: The principles of aerospace engineering. Scientists here also are exploring the mechanisms \u2014 and possible cause \u2014 of the sleep disorder narcolepsy; and analyzing a diabetes drug that has shown promise in alleviating sleep apnea. Meanwhile, the Sleep Center continues to grow its overnight-study program, with the recent expansion at the Liberty Campus in suburban Cincinnati. Tireless collaboration works. They are, in a sense, the researchers who will not rest until every child can. Putting Sleep Disorders to Bed Once and for All 24 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 25Pediatric surgery and aerospace engineering might seem to occupy parallel universes \u2014 but not anymore for children with sleep apnea. Researchers at Cincinnati Children's and the University of Cincinnati's Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics are using the mechanical concepts of computational 3D modeling, air flow, turbulence, resistance and fluid dynamics to bring a new level of precision to a decid - edly non-mechanical task: the surgical correction of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Fueled by more than $3.8 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health, a research team with a wide va - riety of talents has designed and begun testing a 3D computer software modeling system that can replicate the unique geom - etry of an individual child's upper-airway. Within three to five years, these rotating, interactive, full-color models may become available to help surgeons test surgical scenarios, select ideal ap - proaches, and practice procedures long before patients reach the operating room. Ten years ago, the idea of applying aerospace principles to surgical planning would have sounded unlikely at best, says Raouf Amin, MD, Director of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine. \"To think that bioengineers would be instrumental to ad - vancing this research in sleep apnea, or to say we were going to import the science of aerospace and apply it to the airway, no, most probably, that would have been considered science- fiction,\" Amin says. MEDICINE MEETS ROCKET SCIENCE In Cincinnati, bridging the worlds of surgery and aerospace en - gineering has been as simple \u2014 and remarkable \u2014 as crossing a street called Albert Sabin Way that passes between the research towers of Cincinnati Children's and the medical campus of the University of Cincinnati. When he joined the project in 2010, engineering expert Goutham Mylavarapu, PhD, had no biomedical experience. Yet by 2014, he had co-authored a paper in the Journal of Biomechanics that used computational fluid dynamics to char - acterize how air ebbs and flows as it moves through the human airway. \"It took me a year just to understand the medical prin - ciples,\" he says with a slight laugh. \"Now, I tell my wife, perhaps I should go back to school and become an MD.\" Indeed, learning each other's terminology and scientific procedures required plenty of communication. But team mem - bers were motivated by the stakes involved. In the past three years, Cincinnati Children's has experi - enced a 20 percent spike in children visiting its sleep study lab to be assessed for sleep disorders. The assessments have grown from 2,184 in fiscal year 2013 to 2,626 in fiscal year 2015. The prevalence of sleep apnea, the most common form of sleep disorder, is rising for a number of reasons. Childhood obesity plays a role, as do improved diagnostic systems and in - creased public awareness of the health risks of sleep apnea. Any child can be affected by a sleep disorder; children with Down syndrome or craniofacial abnormalities are particularly susceptible. Untreated, sleep disorders can lead to compromised cognitive function, excessive daytime sleepiness, academic struggles, behavioral challenges and weight fluctuation. Some studies suggest that sleep apnea symptoms can mimic ADHD, bringing the risk of misdiagnosis. Many children with sleep apnea can be treated with non- surgical options like weight-loss programs or CPAP breath - ing devices. But some children, particularly those with Down syndrome, find the CPAP mask and its head straps intolerable. These and other children with significant structural issues af - fecting their airways require a more invasive, surgical approach.Virtual Surgery Could Help Children With Sleep Apnea Breathe Easier by Tom O'Neill 26 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015CREATING AN AIRWAY SURGERY RESEARCH AGENDA Aerospace science has the potential to transform surgical tech - niques, says Stacey Ishman, MD, MPH, Surgical Director of the Upper Airway Center and Director of Otolaryngology Outcomes Research. \"This could fundamentally change our approach in two ways,\" she says. \"Some patients should never undergo surgery, so by seeing the outcome beforehand, you can avoid the side effects and the pain. The other is in considering several surgical options. Which is best, what are the priorities?\" Amin agrees that the upper airway presents a tricky sur - gical landscape. Below the larynx, the airway is stiffer, which supports long-lasting surgical outcomes. But above the larynx, the elasticity of softer tissues complicates everything. T reating residual obstruction at multiple levels of the upper-airway can require multiple procedures, and success rates hover at about 60 percent. \"Sometimes the improvement is not sustained,\" Amin says. \"The most challenging problem is how to estimate the soft tissue.\" The new modeling system can help surgeons better under - stand the dynamics of how soft tissue will react to resection. With more data to characterize the phenotype, the odds of pro - viding a lasting treatment improve, Amin says. DYMOSA STUDY PROVIDES DATA Since 2010, Amin, Sally Shott, MD, Division of Otolaryngology, and other colleagues have been conducting a study called Dynamic Computational Modeling of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (DYMOSA). The NIH has supported the work with an initial three-year RO1 grant and subsequent extensions.The project involves experts from Otolaryngology, Pulmonary Medicine, Sleep Medicine, Radiology, Anesthesia and, of course, the space guys at UC. The team is one of very few in the world conducting cine MRI imaging of the airways of children with Down syndrome who also have persistent OSA. Cine is a form of MRI that captures the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. \"There's not a lot of great data out there,\" Ishman says. \"And kids with Down syndrome were underrepresented in what studies did exist.\" Researchers knew this much: By age 4, almost 60 percent of children with Down syndrome suffer abnormal sleep, and eight out of 10 exhibit sleep apnea by age 9. Studies show that virtually every child with Down syndrome will develop sleep apnea at some point in childhood. Anatomy betrays them. They have higher prevalence of midface hypoplasia with smaller airway size in the oral cavity, nose, nasopharynx and at the base of tongue. They have a larg - er-than-average volume of tongue tissue. Poor muscle tone also contributes to airway collapse. Raouf Amin, MD, Director of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine, believes computational modeling, with an assist from aerospace engineering principles, could be transformative in planning upper-airway surgical strategies. Measuring air flow over a cantilever attached to a cylinder, researchers can see how upper-airway walls (above) respond differently from rigid structures (below). CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 27 In addition, a 50 percent incidence of underlying heart abnormalities in children with Down places them at higher risk for developing the more severe consequences associated with sleep apnea. To date, 55 children with Down syndrome have participat - ed in the DYMOSA study. If virtual surgery modeling proves effective for this group, the approach can be adjusted for other pediatric populations with OSA, the researchers contend. CASE REPORTS APPEAR PROMISING Amin, Ishman, Shott and colleagues examine DYMOSA's en - couraging progress in a prospective case report called \"New Frontiers in the T reatment of OSA in Children: Computational Modeling of the Airway for Surgical Planning.\" The report focuses on three types of virtual surgeries per - formed on airway models created for each subject: A 2-milli - meter base-of-tongue resection, a 4-millimeter resection, and a virtual palate reconstruction (palatoplasty). At 10 liters/minute of air flow, upper-airway resistance decreased by 46 percent for the 2-mm resection and 48 percent for the 4-mm approach. When the palate also was excised, air resistance decreased an additional 16 percent. \"Computational modeling of the airway and associated virtual surgery allow for pre-operative planning that provides the surgeon with information both on 'where' to operate, and on 'how much' tissue to remove for potentially improved post- operative success,\" the authors wrote. < The airway computational modeling sys - tem in development in the Pulmonology and Otolaryngology divisions is similar to recent work at Cincinnati Children's Heart Institute, where surgeons are using comput - er-generated 3D-printed models of individual hearts to plan operations. \"We haven't utilized a printer yet, but the modeling employs the same principle as 3D hearts,\" says Raouf Amin, MD. \"It's based on formulas to understand the effect of flow and pressure within a structure, whether it's a mus - cle or a blood vessel or a heart or an airway. That's why we bring in the physicists who are the experts in this computational model.\" This is where Goutham Mylavarapu comes in. The first author of the \"New Frontiers\" report had studied mechanical engineering in his na - tive India, at the Indian Institute of Technology. He had no particular interest in medicine when he came to Cincinnati to pursue his PhD at UC's Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics. \"It all happened by chance,\" Mylavarapu says. Instead of working on aircraft, he wound up studying under Ephraim Gutmark, PhD, an Ohio Eminent Scholar at UC who happened to have experience collaborating with Cincinnati Children's to study air flow and sound waves in children with damaged larynxes. For airplane wings and car exhaust sys - tems, the fluid dynamics involved can be fairly straightforward. Human anatomy has more complex and individualized structures. Mylavarapu, Gutmark and colleagues out - lined how it works in a 2014 paper published in the Journal of Biomechanics . The work starts with data from three medical technologies: cine MRI images that capture a child's ce - rebrospinal fluid flow. As the heart beats, this fluid flow is forced out of the ventricle of the brain and down the spinal canal. polysomnography sleep studies , which record brain wave activity, oxygen level in the blood, breathing and heart rate, and eye and leg movement sleep endoscopy , in which a patient is given incremental amounts of anesthesia to induce sleep for a short time to the point where apnea occurs, but before there is a drop in blood-oxygen level. An endoscopy camera shows the key areas of obstruction, effectively taking out some of the guess - work. These pre-op test results produce a base - line measure quantifying flow velocity, turbu - lence, pressure and wall sheer stress. \"There is so much physics and mechanics involved,\" Mylavarapu says. \"The challenge is that the up - per-airway is a very flexible structure.\"How the Modeling System Works by Tom O'Neill Stacy Ishman, MD, MPH. 28 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015With the baseline established, \"virtual sur - gery\" begins. When tissue is virtually resected, the algorithms change, revealing new airflow results. Surgeons can explore variations in ap - proach until they find the optimal flow. The system is not perfect. For example, the airways of some children balloon out as they breathe, a type of movement that cannot be captured in cine MRI images. But in most cas - es, the computer models vastly reduce the edu - cated guesswork involved in traditional surgery. Amin plans to establish a center within a year specifically dedicated to \"virtual surgery.\" He predicts such a center could play a key role in improving diagnostic techniques and estab - lishing best practices for sleep apnea treatment. Plenty more research is needed. In a systematic review published July 7, 2015, in Laryngoscope , Amin, Ishman, Sally Shott, MD, and colleagues found a general lack of data regarding patient selection, outcomes for OSA surgery, and the effectiveness of some com - monly used tools to identify OSA sites. The study raises tough questions, but Amin predicts the ongoing work of the new virtual surgery center will soon begin providing stronger answers. 0.331.3 12.32.73 0.332 0.671.7 A 3D model illustrates deformation of the airway wall according to variations in breathing-mask pressure. The red in the bottom image results from higher air pressure. A drug approved to combat diabetes, and later obesity, is showing early prom - ise in treating sleep apnea in adults. Raouf Amin, MD, Director of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine, is cau - tiously optimistic that liraglutide could one day help in alleviating pediatric apnea. In a pilot study sponsored by Cincinnati Children's, researchers found that in 18 adult non-diabetics with ap - nea, 12 showed an average decrease in severity of 44 percent. The clinical trial also involved nine control non-diabetics who also have OSA but did not receive liraglutide for the four-week period. Amin presented the findings in May earlier this year to the American Thoracic Society. \"We made some very interesting observations,\" Amin says. \"Liraglutide affects the central and pe - ripheral networks. Some are metabo - lism-related, which is why it is good for diabetes. But it also affects the central control of breathing.\" Still, he points out, the result means a third of participants using liraglutide showed no response. And, of course, the sample size was small. \"There is a difference in how they re - sponded,\" Amin says. \"The next step is understanding the mechanism.\" As a peptide-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide works by binding to the same receptors as the metabolic hormone GLP-1, which increases the secretion of insulin. The drug gained FDA approval as a type 2 diabetes treatment in 2010 and was approved in 2014 for some patients with obesity.Researchers hypothesize that lira - glutide could cause significant increases in orexin, a neuropeptide that regulates arousal and wakefulness, as well as car - bon dioxide chemosensitivity. The drug also appears to prompt a decrease in leptin, which regulates energy balance. In an update filed Aug. 3, 2015, with the National Institutes of Health, researchers wrote: \"The development of a new pharmacological treatment for sleep-disordered breathing could bring a breakthrough discovery that will impact a rapidly growing population of children and adults with this disorder.\" Primary completion of the clinical trial is expected in December.Diabetes Drug Shows Early Promise in Alleviating Sleep Apnea CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 29In children with narcolepsy, the body's light switch regulat - ing sleep has faulty wiring somewhere behind the wall. Daytime wakefulness blinks into dream sleep last - ing for several seconds or minutes, and sometimes much longer. It works in reverse as well, with frequent night-sleep interruptions. Narcolepsy is unrelenting. But so is Narong Simakajorn - boon, MD, a sleep specialist and Director of the Sleep Center at Cincinnati Children's. He is a leading researcher in the field of narcolepsy who also heads the pediatric working group of the Sleep Research Network. \"There appears to be several factors, but there is an autoimmune component that affects the development of narco - lepsy,\" he says. \"The goal is to better understand those potential triggers.\" Worldwide, narcolepsy affects about 30 per 100,000 people. Five years ago, rapid increases in childhood narcolepsy in Europe were linked to a single manufacturer of a vaccine for the H1N1 influenza virus. The vaccine connection was surpris - ing, but it could not explain a corresponding rise in Northern China, where the virus itself was a suspected environmental trigger. Nor could the vaccine link explain narcolepsy cases rising in the U.S., where H1N1 vaccination rates were low and the European vaccine was never made available. Something more complicated is going on, Simakajornboon contends. In a case report published March 15, 2013, in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine , a team of researchers led by Sima - kajornboon reported a case following streptococcus infection. Researchers at Stanford theorized that the body's response to streptococcal infection could trigger narcolepsy in children who have a genetic predisposition to the disorder. The Stanford team noted that the risk of narcolepsy was 5.4 times higher in patients with a physician-diagnosed strep infection. Also, prior to onset The Mystery of Narcolepsy's Secret Triggers Autoimmune response and the brain neurotransmitter hypocretin might hold crucial clues to solving this elusive sleep disorder by Tom OTHER VACCINE STREP INFECTION RECENT CASES PREVIOUS CASESIn comparing clinical characteristics in the rise of narcolepsy and possible correlations to infections and vaccinations, researchers found a seasonal pattern to recent cases but no clear link to vaccinations. Source: Multi-center Study of Early Onset Childhood Narcolepsy: Recent Cases and the Role of Infection, Sleep Research NetworkTRACKING POSSIBLE CAUSES BEFORE AND AFTER 2009 30 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015of narcolepsy, there was a higher rate of strep infection in children who had yet to go through puberty than those who had. \"There is an increase in cases that are pre-puberty,\" Simakajornboon says. \"From five to 10 percent to about 30 percent, and these cases have a pretty rapid onset.\" The body's autoimmune response to infection might play a key role in what ultimately could be a simple case of mistaken identity. Studies have shown a strong genetic association between narcolepsy-cataplexy (an abrupt loss of muscle control) and processes in the brain involving leukocyte antigen (HLA) and a T-cell receptor that responds to antigens. Simakajornboon says there could be \"cross-reactivity\" between those antibodies and the neurotransmitter hypocretin, which controls alertness. Hypocretin is secreted by the approxi - mately 70,000 neurons in the hypothalamus. Children with narcolepsy have significantly decreased levels of hypocretin. Simakajornboon and other investigators speculate that the Group A Strep and viral antigen may have or share some epitopes that are similar to the antigen in hypocretin neurons. Epitopes are the parts of an antigen that allow an antibody to attach. \"Therefore,\" he says, \"after strep or viral infection, the antibody to strep may mistakenly recognize the antigen of hypocretin neurons and attack the neurons.\" Those same neurons also regulate appetite and feeding behavior, which could explain why narcolepsy patients have higher-than-average rates of obesity and weight fluctuation. Simakajornboon and many other researchers believe that both genetic and environmental factors are at work. Some cases are clearly inherited, but others are not. In the U.S., however, longitudinal data on narcolepsy are limited. Because it is both rare and non-communicable, narcolepsy does not require reporting to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Center for Health Statistics. Simakajornboon is helping to change that through the Sleep Research Network, which has grown to 22 institutions from 14 since he took a leadership role in its pediatric working group in 2010. Before his involvement, the network had no database on pediatric narcolepsy. Now the group has data on 357 cases, with a goal of reaching 700. \"I think that this database will be an important first step in multicenter collaborations for clinical trials in pediatric narcolepsy,\" Simakajornboon says. \"Also, identifying early cases may lead to more effective early intervention such as immunotherapy.\" Simakajornboon spoke on behalf of the network in June in Seattle at SLEEP 2015, the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies. He noted that symptoms in cases since 2009 differ from previous cases. More recent cases share higher rates of cataplexy and higher likelihood of anxiety, exces - sive weight gain, abnormal movement and behavior change. Unlocking the causes of those changing trends could be critical to solving the mystery of the sharp rise in child - hood narcolepsy diagnosis. In addition to excessive daytime sleepiness, other symptoms could include sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations that are unusually vivid and at times very frightening to children. For now, narcolepsy is treated with medications that minimize excessive daytime sleepiness and other symptoms. Behavioral changes such as avoiding caffeine and adhering to a set schedule for sleep and napping also help. Finding better treatments is important because sleep is as important to the human body as food and air, Simakajornboon says. \"We always see sleep as a normal physiological thing that happens, but people tend to underestimate how sleep impacts your overall life.\" < Narong Simakajornboon, MD , suspects that narcolepsy onset could be rooted in a mistaken autoimmune response. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 31Kicking Asthma Out of School The prevalence of asthma in Cincinnati's inner-city schools is breathtaking. As many as one in five kids in the city has it, and many barely realize their condition. As one out-of-breath student said after ballet practice: \"Is this my asthma? I always breathe like this.\" Scenes like this may soon be changing as leaders at Cincinnati Children's bring years of nationally-renowned asthma research experience to bear as they launch a pilot project to create an asthma-free school. The plan: identify high-risk students, enlist school nurses and health assistants, and use the latest in tracking technology and electronic medical records to improve chronically poor adherence patterns. The goal: to reach that day when no child misses school due to an asthma exacerbation. 32 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 33Of the 36,000 children with asthma in Hamilton County, more than 4,700 are students in the Cincinnati Public Schools (CPS). The number reflects the high rates of asthma common to urban populations. Most of the school district's students are African American, who have a 60 percent higher asthma prevalence than the overall population. Many live in high-risk neighborhoods where poverty, lack of transportation to healthcare, chaotic housing, and low health literacy among parents all combine to make it hard to keep asthma under control. These are the children who feel an alarming but all-too- familiar tightness when a smoker lights up in the apartment, who risk having an exacerbation during football practice, who go without medication when their inhaler runs out and no one at home has the time or resources to pick up a new one. These are the children who miss too much school because of their poorly controlled asthma. So this is where Cincinnati Children's, through its Asthma Population Health Initiative, wants to help create an \"asthma-free school.\" It might sound like a near-impossible dream, but this is exactly where the ex - pertise of one of the nation's top asthma centers is needed the most. The mission is to test and change the system, says Carolyn Kercsmar, MD, Director of the Asthma Center at Cincinnati Children's, to see if it is possible to create a school environ - ment where students with asthma are \"free from exacerbations.\" Success would mean \"students would be free from the need to miss school due to asthma. They would have good asthma con - trol,\" she says. \"Our goal was to put resources in schools to make that happen.\" PILOT PROJECT TAKES OFF Beginning in spring 2015, the asthma population health team began piloting a $300,000 asthma-free schools program at Oyler School in Price Hill and South Avondale School, both of which have well-established school-based health centers. The program includes support from Cincinnati Children's James M. Anderson Center for Health Systems Excellence, the Luther Foundation and the Verizon Foundation. High-risk students and those who frequently miss school due to asthma are invited into a program in which daily control - ler medication can be administered at school, supervised by the school nurse or health assistant. Students, school staff and par - ents will take part in asthma education and training, which will include public service videos produced by Cincinnati students. An inhaler cap sensor and mobile software management program called Propeller Health will provide school nurses and primary care physicians with real-time feedback of medication adherence and symptom reporting. Cincinnati Children's also will provide telehealth visits with asthma specialists for students who don't have a medical home or need a specialist consult.Quest Begins to Create an 'Asthma-Free' School by Sarah Stankorb 34 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015Carolyn Kercsmar, MD , directs the Asthma Center at Cincinnati Children's. Making these schools \"asthma-free\" will mean zero asth - ma-related absences \u2014 except perhaps for the most severe cases who have no optimal treatment options. The program will be able to document that students' asthma was well controlled during the school year and that they suffered no severe asthma exacerbations. A HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT Cincinnati may be the perfect place to test the feasibility of creating just such an environment, says Gregg Sabla, project manager for the Asthma Center. As many as one in five kids in the city has asthma, and the medical center knows from experience how hard it can be to keep them connected to care. No more than half of patients keep their appointments or fill their prescriptions. Families move frequently and parents' cell numbers change constantly, making it hard for schools and physicians to follow up. But Cincinnati Children's also has years of experience working with CPS. Starting in 2007, when Kercsmar joined the medical cen - ter, the Asthma Center partnered with Mona Mansour, MD, MS, and the Division of General and Community Pediatrics to forge a partnership with local schools. The Cincinnati Children's team works directly with school nurses to identify children with asthma and coordinate care. Interventions have included training school nurses, providing home delivery of As many as one in five kids in the city has asthma, and the medical center knows from experience how hard it can be to keep them connected to care. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 35prescription medications, developing a home health nurse edu - cator program, even providing school nurses \"read-only\" access to Cincinnati Children's medical records for their shared stu - dents to support coordination of care. Improving asthma care in the community has been a strate - gic goal at Cincinnati Children's for several years. In 2010, one goal set for the Asthma team was to reduce emergency depart - ment visits and hospitalization due to asthma by 20 percent by June 2015. They achieved that goal a year ahead of schedule. MUCH MORE WORK AWAITS Even though Cincinnati Children's provides a good safety net that has improved outcomes for kids with asthma, every net has holes. Over the next few years, the Asthma Center aims to demonstrate that comprehensive, managed asthma care that leverages partnerships with schools can create a safety net so finely woven that no child slips through the gaps.Barb Wiley-Kroner, Supervisor of the School and Adolescent Health Program for the Cincinnati Health Department, has worked closely with Cincinnati Children's asthma program and is well aware of the challenges ahead. With every new school year, the need to educate new classes of families and patients about asthma returns. \"We've had families that did not really view asthma as a chronic illness to be managed,\" she says. \"They just lived ex - acerbation to exacerbation. So long as their kid didn't flare up, they thought they were fine.\" What's more, Wiley-Kroner notes, some students with asthma do not realize how far their symptoms are from or - dinary. She recalls a student at CPS' well-known School for Creative and Performing Arts who shrugged off the fact that she was wheezing audibly after finishing ballet class. \"She said, 'Is this my asthma? I always breathe like this.' Many of our students with asthma don't realize their friends without asthma don't struggle as much to breathe.\" < Asthma experts at Cincinnati Children's are teaming with school nurses at South Avondale School to improve health education and medication adherence for students there. 36 RESEARCH HORIZONS / FALL 2015Research Horizons Editorial Advisors: Margaret Hostetter, MD Arnold Strauss, MD Editorial Staff: Tim Bonfield/Managing Editor Tom O'Neill Contributors: Nick Miller, Sarah Stankorb, Mary Silva Design and Illustration: The Fairview Agency Photography: Julie Kramer, Michael WilsonResearch Horizons is published by Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation to showcase the work of our doctors and scientists.
