The most rapid is called a beta brain wave pattern, the pattern of normal waking consciousness. Beta is associated with concentration, arousal, alertness, and cognition. At its highest, most rapid levels, though, beta is associated with anxiety, disharmony, and unease. (Perhaps the ability to slow yourself down from those levels might be beneficial??) As you become more relaxed, your brain wave activity slows into what is called an alpha brain wave pattern. Alpha patterns vary from deep alpha, a state of deep relaxation often referred to as the twilight state between sleep and waking, to the higher end of alpha which is a more focused yet still very relaxed state. | | | | Beta (14-30 Hz) Concentration, arousal, alertness, cognition Higher levels associated with anxiety, unease, feelings of separation, fight or flight | | Alpha (8-13.9 Hz) Relaxation, superlearning, relaxed focus, light trance, increased serontonin production Pre-sleep, pre-waking drowsiness, meditation, beginning of access to unconscious mind | | Theta (4-7.9 Hz) Dreaming sleep (REM sleep) Increased production of catecholamines (vital for learning and memory), increased creativity Integrative, emotional experiences, potential change in behavior, increased retention of learned material Hypnagogic imagery, trance, deep meditation, access to unconscious mind | | Delta (.1-3.9 Hz) Dreamless sleep Human growth hormone released Deep, trance-like, non-physical state, loss of body awareness Access to unconscious and \"collective unconscious\" mind, greatest \"push\" to brain when induced with Holosync\u00ae When you are absorbed in a good book (or a television show) you are probably in alpha. And, as I already mentioned, alpha is often associated with what is known as \"superlearning\"\u2014the ability to learn, process, store and recall large amounts of information quickly and efficiently. Slower still are theta waves. Theta is best known as the brain wave state of dreaming sleep, but it is also associated with a number of other beneficial states, including increased creativity, some kinds of superlearning, increased memory abilities, and what are called integrative experiences (in which we make broadly-based positive changes in the way we see ourselves, others, or a certain life situation). \"Ah-ha!\" experiences, where you suddenly \"get it,\" have an insight, or a great idea suddenly comes to you, are accompanied by bursts of theta waves in your brain. You can probably see why putting yourself in this state might increase your effectiveness! Here's another exciting characteristic of the theta state: Dr. Thomas Budzynski, a noted researcher in this field, has said that critical and often self-sabotaging filters of the left brain are bypassed in a theta state, and that in terms of making positive changes in beliefs or habit patterns, \"a lot of work gets done very quickly.\" Are you beginning to see the possibilities? And best of all, theta is also a state of tremendous stress relief. In the slower theta brain wave pattern, the brain makes lots of relaxing endorphins that really do\u2014as you will see (or rather, feel) when you try it for yourself\u2014melt your stress away. The slowest brain wave pattern is delta, the brain wave pattern of dreamless sleep. Generally people are asleep in delta, but there is evidence that it is possible to remain alert in this state\u2014a very deep, trance-like, non-physical state you'll have to experience to appreciate. In certain delta frequencies the brain releases many highly beneficial substances, including human growth hormone, which we ordinarily make in decreasing quantities as we get older, resulting in many aging symptoms including loss of muscle tone, increased weight gain, loss of stamina, and many diseases associated with aging. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin announced to the media in 1990 that they had injected synthetic growth hormone into a small group of elderly men between the ages of 61 and 81. The result was a sudden rejuvenation that reversed biological aging by as much a 20 years! These treatments were, unfortunately, very expensive (about $14,000 a year) and the effects disappeared when the treatments were discontinued. But you can stimulate the production of this and other beneficial substances, easily and safely, by exposing yourself for a little while each day to our revolutionary Holosync\u00ae technology! Here's more exciting news: Recent research performed by Dr. Vincent Giampapa, M.D., a prominent anti-aging researcher and past-president of the American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine, revealed that Holosync\u00ae dramatically affects production of three important hormones related to increased longevity, stress, and enhanced well-being: cortisol, DHEA, and melatonin. Cortisol is a hormone naturally produced by the adrenal glands. According to Dr. Giampapa, cortisol is the major age-accelerating hormone. It also interferes with learning and memory and is, in general, bad news for your health and your well-being. Cortisol is the \"stress hormone,\" and the more of it you have, the more stressed you feel...the more susceptible to disease you are and the faster you age! Another hormone, DHEA, is also produced by your adrenal glands. DHEA is a precursor, or source ingredient, to virtually every hormone your body needs. DHEA level is a key determinant of physiological age and resistance to disease. When levels are low, you're more susceptible to aging and disease; when they're high, the body is at its peak\u2014vibrant, healthy, and able to combat disease effectively. DHEA acts as a buffer against stress-related hormones (such as cortisol), which is why as you get older and make less DHEA you are more susceptible to stress and disease. How important is DHEA? A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (December 11, 1986) found that a 100 microgram per deciliter increase in DHEA blood levels corresponded with a 48% reduction in mortality due to cardiovascular disease\u2014and a 36% reduction in mortality for any reason! DHEA is very important! The third hormone we tested was melatonin. Melatonin, everyone knows, is a hormone that helps to create restful sleep. We make less of it as we age, and since during sleep many important rejuvenating substances are created in the brain, the inability to sleep soundly can dramatically decrease the quality of your life and greatly accelerate the aging process. New research also reveals that it is a powerful antioxidant. In fact, it is even more powerful than Vitamin E. So how does Holosync\u00ae affect levels of these three substances having so much affect on the quality (and length) of your life? In a before and after study of 19 people using Holosync\u00ae the following changes were noted in levels of DHEA, cortisol, and melatonin: - In just three days, over 68% had increases in DHEA levels, with an average increase of 43.77%. Several people had increases of 50, 60, even 90%. - Cortisol, on the other hand, was down an average of 46.47%, with positive changes in 68% of the people, and with several people having decreases of 70 or 80%. - Melatonin levels increased an average of 97.77%, with positive changes happening in over 73% of the people. Many had improvements of 100, 200, even 300%. What does this mean? It means that listening to CDs containing Holosync\u00ae not only dramatically lowers stress by regulating the biochemical source of stress, it also means that Holosync\u00ae slows the aging process and... ...increases both well-being and longevity!
