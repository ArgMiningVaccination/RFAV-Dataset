The original system of Bach Flower Remedies consists of 38 flower-based remedies. These remedies are designed to gently restore the balance between mind and body by casting out negative emotions such as fear, worry, frustration and indecision. They also address other emotions that can interfere with the equilibrium of the being as a whole. The remedies restore harmony to the user so that the body is free to heal itself. Developed in the 1920s by Dr Edward Bach, Bach Flower Remedies are an all-natural treatment to address emotional imbalances that impact health and wellbeing. The remedies are made from wildflowers and are safe for adults, children, babies, even pets! The Bach Flower Remedy sessions are a deep process of self-discovery and emotional awareness, allowing you to understand and pinpoint the underlying emotions that directly impact your overall health and wellness. During the session your Bach Remedy practitioner identifies the specific remedies (your customised personal mixture) that can help you in managing your emotional state; restoring balance and laying the ground for a powerfully beneficial state of mind. Each individual experiences the effect of Bach Flower Remedies in a different way. It will mainly depend on which emotions the client is impacted by and for how long. While BodyTalk does not diagnose or treat specific ailments, it allows the body's own healing abilities to effect change. Clients have exhibited long-lasting and ongoing improvements in these areas: BodyTalk is a consciousness-based, non-invasive therapy that works with the body in its healing process. It can be used as a stand-alone system to address a variety of health conditions or integrated with other health systems and therapies to promote effective and faster healing. BodyTalk is a simple and effective holistic therapy that allows the body's energy systems to be re-synchronised so they can operate as nature intended. Each system, cell and atom is in constant communication with each other at all times. Through exposure to the stresses of day-to-day life however, these lines of communication can become compromised or disconnected, which then leads to a decline in physical, emotional and mental wellbeing. Reconnecting these lines of communication enables the body's internal mechanisms to function at optimal levels, thus repairing and preventing disease while rapidly accelerating the healing process. In this way, BodyTalk stimulates the body's innate ability to balance and heal itself on all levels. The BodyTalk Process Bowen Therapy (ISBT) treats: It is effective in treating a broad range of muscular and structural complaints as well as problems in areas such as the stomach, lungs, kidneys and bladder. Bowen Therapy is a non-invasive form of bodywork in which gentle rolling moves are applied to specific points on muscles, tendons and ligaments. It allows the body to regain and maintain even weight distribution and increases the circulation of blood, lymph and vital energy. Used to treat a range of conditions related to pain, sleep issues, emotional and/or energetic blockages - cranial sacral therapy can also bring about profound shifts in consciousness. Focus is on cranial sacral system - the system that comprises the brain, spine and sacrum. Touch is very gentle (more so that Bowen Therapy) and aims to enhance the functioning of the cranial-sacral system, which comprises of membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. Through gentle palpation, it complements the body's natural self-healing mechanism to calm the nervous system, restore energy, and encourage ease of body movement. Cranial-Sacral Therapy treats: Facial Reflex Therapy Sorensensistem treats: Developed by world renowned reflexologist Lone Sorensen, Facial Reflex Therapy Sorensensistem combines Chinese energy meridians and acupuncture points, Vietnamese and South American body maps, alongside modern science of neuroanatomy to enable the therapist to identify imbalances in the patient's health and provides the knowledge to begin the healing process. It aims to re-balance the client on all levels: physically, psychologically, energetically - working with the entire body system to address specific issues. The holistic treatment works by using gentle facial massage techniques for precise stimulation of reflex points, nerve points and zones on the face to send impulses to the brain and bring the body's energy (qi) back into alignment and balance. Facial Reflex therapy can be used for both children and adults. Treatment is individualised based on the client's health concerns. Most people find Facial Reflex Therapy Sorensensistem to be deeply relaxing. It also appears to have rejuvenating, uplifting and toning effects on the face. Crystal healing is particularly helpful if you are lacking in energy, struggling with stress, anxiety, headaches and/or difficulty in sleeping. Crystal healing is a gentle and soothing therapy that employs crystals and gemstones as conduits for natural healing energy. The stones channel positive energy and work holistically to harmonise the mind, body and emotions in order to improve your wellbeing. During a healing session, various stones or crystals are placed on your chakras points or around your body to construct an \"energy grid\". The technique is based on guidance and learning from internationally renowned crystal master Katrina Raphaell (Katrina Crystal Academy), who has developed these grids so they consistently create a gentle yet powerful healing energy. The Crystal Healing sessions provide a deep process of emotional discovery, allowing you to understand and pinpoint the underlying events and emotions that directly impact your overall health and wellness. During the session our practitioner will also assist you by identifying your personal stone, which you can carry daily and be a part of your everyday life to increase your overall feeling of wellbeing. Each individual experiences the effect of Himalayan Crystal Healing in a different way. Some may feel heat or a tingly sensation, some may have visions while in this relaxed state, some even cry after the session because of the emotional release that occurs, while others relax into sleep. In the days that follow a session, you may experience a feeling of physical or emotional detoxification; this is your body healing itself. Hypnotherapy or therapeutic hypnosis accesses unconscious mental processes to adopt new mental tools related to those processes while the person is in a modified state of consciousness. This method is a brief therapy: the person only needs a limited number of sessions before he/she can start to feel the effect of the intervention. It is possible to treat light to moderate psychological issues without a deep root cause in less than 5 sessions. For moderate to more severe issues or to treat problems that have been with the person most of their life, they may need between 5-10 sessions. Any health issues involving a person's mind or emotions can be relieved through hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy can also provide psychological support for physical issues when combined with a medical approach. Iridology is not a treatment therapy but rather a diagnostic tool used to detect underlying signs of issues. Your Iris Report includes information on your current state of health with a focus on three key areas: Iridology provides information about the body tissues that can indicate a predisposition to illness before symptoms appear. Iridology is the science and practice of eye analysis to reveal a person's relative state of health. The patterns, structures, colours and degrees of lightness and darkness in the iris can review information such as inherent strengths and weaknesses in the body, the precise location of over-activity, irritation, injury or degeneration of the tissues and organs. Toxin accumulation levels can be identified, as well as nutritional and chemical imbalances. Iridology is safe, non-invasive and painless. The entire process: iris photo, interview, analysis and debrief, takes about two weeks. The benefits of Japanese Cosmo Facial Lifting include: Japanese Cosmo Facial Lifting is a neuro-sensorial procedure that is performed on the face using ecological and natural products. As a non-surgical alternative to a facelift, it stimulates 21 traditional acupuncture points through the facial tissue to help with its regeneration. It also tones the muscles of the face, minimizing fine lines and wrinkles, leaving the face skin looking fresh and luminous. Reflexology is the application of appropriate pressure to specific points and areas on the feet and hands. It has been used to treat a number of health conditions for thousands of years and can help: The underlying theory behind reflexology is that there are areas and reflex points on the feet and hands that correspond to specific organs, glands and other parts of the body. Reflex pressure boosts circulation, activates nerves and sends signals that balance the nervous system or release chemicals such as endorphins that reduce pain and stress. Reflexology also promotes relaxation, improves circulation, reduces pain, boosts organ health, soothes tired feet and encourages overall healing. Reflexology is an personalised treatment tailored to your needs. It takes into account both physical and non-physical factors that might be affecting wellbeing as a whole. Several studies funded by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health indicate that reflexology may reduce pain and psychological symptoms, such as anxiety and low mood, while enhancing relaxation and sleep. Studies also show that reflexology may have benefits in palliative care. Reiki is a gentle and effective healing form that involves the transmission of energy (qi) through the hands. Traditionally, this was only performed in the East by Qi Gong masters. However, a Japanese master Usui, found a way to teach others without the decades of training that used to be involved. This system is called Reiki. A Reiki practitioner first imagines certain symbolic images to bring down healing qi (or in Japanese, ki), then the practitioner places his or her hands on the client's body. The client's own body then draws in the amount of life-force energy that it requires. It is felt as a warming and relaxing sensation by most people. The body utilises this energy for relaxation, repair and revitalisation. Though Reiki has become quite a popular and relatively easy certification to achieve in recent years, at IMI we are blessed to have a Reiki master who has trained with some of the original teachers from the Usui Reiki Tradition. This master has taught over 6,000 students and teachers at seminars throughout the world. \"There is no true healing unless there is a change in outlook, peace of mind and inner happiness.\" \u2014Dr Bach, British physician (1886-1936) \"Health is a state of complete harmony of the body, mind and spirit.
