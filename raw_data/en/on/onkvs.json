Introduction The plaintiffs' bar, large pharmaceutical comp anies, the medical profession, the United States government, and thousands of parent s of autistic children are now clashing in a little-known branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C. sometimes called the \"vaccine court.\"1 At issue is whether autism is caused by childhood vaccines. On June 11, 2007, lawyers for the parents of 4,900 autistic children began arguments in an unprecedented class action suit first filed in the vaccine court July 3, 2002.2 The original claim by the parents was that MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccines and thimerosal-containing vaccines could combine to cause autism.3 Recently, the Petitioners' Steering Committee representing th e parents also proposed two new claims: (1) that MMR vaccine alone can cause autism; and (2) that the mercury-based preservative thimerosal alone, routinely used from the 1930's until 2001 to prevent bacterial contamination of multi-dose vial s of non-MMR vaccines, can cause autism. 4 The plaintiffs' demand is for monetary comp ensation from the United States government. No decision has yet been reached by the court, nor is one on the horizon.5 The issue of whether childhood vaccination causes autism or related syndromes and is somehow responsible for the alleged autism \"epidemic\" in the United States is highly controversial, high-profile, and has recei ved extensive media coverage for years. 6 Popular magazines such as Rolling Stone7 have recently published on the controversy, and just this month the pilot episode of the newest law drama series on television specifically focused on the topic of autism caused by childhood vaccines.8 The public health stakes for the vaccine court's decision are enormous and will dramatically affect whether drug manufacturers will continue to market childhood vaccines in the United States. 1 UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS , OFFICE OF SPECIAL MASTERS , available at http://www.uscfc.usc ourt.gov/OSMPage.htm (last accessed January 21, 2006). 2 In re Claims for Vaccine Injuries Resulting in Autism Spectrum Disorder or a Similar Neurodevelopmental Disorder, Vari ous Petitioners v.

In 1998 Dr. Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Fr ee Hospital in London suggested that the MMR vaccine caused bowel disease and autism.9 Following this often-criticized and recently discredited study,10 the percentage of British children vaccinated against measles dropped from over 90% to approximately 80%, and several outbreaks of the disease followed. Wakefield's study came on the heels of 1970's British medical data11 which suggested that whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine cause d permanent brain damage in children. Fears of the pertussis co mponent of the DPT or Di phtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus combination vaccine soon spread to the United States and ultimately resulted in verdicts against manufacturers of pertussis vaccine for causing SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, later found to be caused by sleeping position), Reye's Syndrome (subsequently found to be the result of anal gesic exposure), coma, and mental retardation. The validity of some of the science in these lawsuits may have been marginal and most was later discredited,12 but the effect of the litigation on vaccine manufacturers' liability exposure was devastating. By 1985 many vaccine manufacturers had difficulty obtaining liability insurance. Within a year Lederle Laboratories in New York was the sole manufacturer of DPT vaccine in the United States and was threatening to cease production. Faced with a potential public health disaster of national proportions and the prospect that the United States was about to become the only Western nation with no pharmaceutical company willing to manufacture vaccines for prevention of devastating childhood infections, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.13 From a public health point of view the penultimat e rational for this legislation was the recognition that compensating families for infr equent but inevitable adverse events in their children would be the necessary pri ce to pay for \"laws to mandate vaccines for diseases that are highly contagious, cause si gnificant morbidity and mortality, and can be prevented with currently available vaccines.\"14 Shielding vaccine manufacturers from tort liability so they would stay in the vaccin e manufacturing business, even if the business were not particularly profitable, was th e other main rationale for the law. 9 AJ Wakefield, SH Murch, A Anthony, et al, Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperp lasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children, 351 L ANCET 637 (2004 ). 10 SH Murch, A Anthony, DH Casson, et al , Retraction of an Interpretation , 363 L ANCET 750 (2004). 11 GT Stewart, Vaccination against whooping-cough: efficacy versus risks , 1 L ANCET 234 (1977). 12 G Evans, Update on vaccine liability in the United States: presentation at the National Vaccine Program Office Workshop on strengthening the supply of rou tinely recommended vaccines in the United States, 12 February 2002 , 42 C LIN.

Edwards, State Mandates and Childhood Immunization , 284 JAMA 3171 (2000). Part 2 of the Act created the National Vacci ne Injury Compensation Program (\"Vaccine Program\"),15 a no-fault compensation scheme funded in part by sales of the vaccines themselves. Because this is a federal \"trust fund\" for compensating victims of alleged vaccine-related injuries, any dispute over whether families will receive compensation requires that the United States government, not the pharmaceutical manufacturer, be named as the defendant. The Vaccine Program contains a list of specific injuries16 for which families may be compensated provide d they and their physicians navigate a relatively straightforward set of medical and regulatory doc uments describing the type and circumstances of the injury. The injuries a nd awards vary from vaccine to vaccine, as do the administrative hurdles (e.g. deadlines for seeking redress). The Vaccine Program became effective in 1988 and immediately provided a generous, fair, and rapid mechanism for compensating hundreds of fa milies whose children were damaged by childhood vaccinations. The Program was also successful in its two other goals of lessening frivolous litigation and preserving domestic childhood vaccine production. At the present time four pharmaceutical companies continue to market childhood vaccines in the United States. 17 How the Vaccine Court Decides: The Special Masters Damage claims under the Vaccine Program ar e managed and adjudica ted by the Office of Special Masters, a Congressionally-created office within the U.S. Court of Federal Claims which has one chief special master and five associate special masters who are appointed to four year terms.18 The special masters comprise the subsection of the court which specifically handles vaccine injury cl aims arising under the 1986 Act. There is no requirement that a special master have a ny formal medical training, and none of the current special masters have an extensive scientific background.19 The special masters have two primary functions: collection of relevant informa tion in a timely manner, and rendering a final, enforceable decision.20 The special masters' rules and orders are easily accessible through the Office of Special Masters website.21 Both published and unpublished decisions may be accessed, and the website is available to the public. It is comprehensive, easy to navigate, and provi des a transparent roadmap to the entire procedural history and eviden tiary basis provided to the court for the ongoing vaccine- autism litigation. When a dispute involving a new injury or claim which does not fall under the administrative guidelines for compensation is brought, the special masters gather and evaluate the evidence, meet with both sides, allow testimony, and issue a ruling.22 In 15 NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM (NVICP), N ATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (NCVIA) OF 1986, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-1 to 300aa-34, available at www.uscfc.uscourts.gov (last accessed February 7, 2008). 16 Id. 17 Id. 18 NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (NCVIA) OF 1986, supra note 15. 19 Id. 20 Id. 21 Id. 22 Id. these disputes over compensation for alleged in juries the entire process is designed to give parties on all sides of di spute access to the decision-ma king process. Typically this includes counsel representing the petitioner (usually the parents) and a Department of Justice attorney representing the Secr etary of Health and Human Services.23 Plaintiffs must only prove that it is more likely than not that the alleged injury was caused by the vaccine in question. Decisions may be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a panel of three judges housed in the same building as the vaccine court.24 The Problem and the Data th e Vaccine Court is Facing According to the World Health Organization autism is a \"type of pervasive developmental disorder that is defined by: (a) the presence of abnormal or impaired development that is manifest before the age of three years, and (b) the characteristic type of abnormal functioning in all three areas of psychopathology: reciprocal social interaction, communication, and restrict ed, stereotyped, repetitive behavior.\" 25 Along with these specific diagnostic features, auti stic children commonly exhibit sleeping and eating disturbances, phobias, temper ta ntrums, and self-directed aggression.26 Autism is one of the five pervasive childhood developmenta l disorders and is not rare; the incidence in the United States is approximately one in 600 births and seems to be increasing.27 Whether this increase is simply due to more expansive definitions of what constitutes autism or is a true increase is not clear.28 No one disputes the fact that autism is usua lly a devastating event for families, and not surprisingly the parents of autistic children have been looking for the cause of autism for decades. That there is some inherited, genetic basis for the disease is not disputed,29 but the precise etiology of autism is not known.30 The scientific evidence linking childhood vaccines, with or without the preservative thimerosal, to autism is sparse. Widely publicized cases involving methylmercury e xposure demonstrated that mercury causes seizures, deafness and mental retardation but not autism.31 The consensus of the academic medical community,32 an expansive Institute of Medicine Report,33 a comprehensive U.S. Food and Drug Administration analysis done by the 23 Id. 24 Id.

Offit, Thimerosal and Vaccines - A Cautionary Tale , 357 N. ENGL. J. MED. 1278 (2007). Center Research,34 and well-designed, large epidemiological studies35 have all failed to establish a link between childhood vaccines, with or without thimerosal,36 and autism. Studies published since 2007 looking at either MMR vaccine alone or thimerasol exposure al one have only continued to reinforce this position.37 Notably, the incidence of autism in the United States and Europe has seemingly continued to rise every year desp ite the fact that vaccines have not been formulated with thimerosal for years.38 Implications of the Upcoming Decision Although the special masters have an advantage over state civil courts in their extensive experience with vaccine-related disputes, and there is no dang er of a jury being swayed by \"junk science,\" no vaccine case in recent me mory has been so high-profile. There is always the risk that non-scien tifically trained judiciary ma y make a poor decision despite overwhelming scientific evidence because of th e dramatic nature of the alleged injuries and media attention. This has happened in high profile cases before,39 and valuable medications with negligible proven morb idity were withdrawn from the market. A vaccine court decision against the vacci ne manufacturers awarding compensation to the plaintiffs will quickly wipe out the trust fund which pays for established childhood vaccine-related injuries, and will guarantee that personal injury attorneys will file product liability suits against the vaccine manufactur ers in state civil courts. However, the question of whether the plaintiffs will be able to prevail in any state court action even if the vaccine court rules in their favor is fa r from decided. Congress clearly intended that the Vaccine Injury Act would \"preempt\" the entire playing field for alleged vaccine- related injuries,40 and efforts to try these cases in state court have been unsuccessful.41 33 IMMUNIZATION SAFETY COMMITTEE , INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE , Immunization Safety Review: Thimerosal- Containing Vaccines and Ne urodevelopmental Disorders , National Academy Press (2001). 34 UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION , CENTER FOR BIOLOGICS EVALUATION AND RESEARCH , Thimerosal in Vaccines , available at http://www.fda.gov/cber/v accine/thimerosal/htm (last accessed March 23, 2005) \"FDA has been actively addres sing the issue of thimerosal as a preservative in vaccines.

If the tort claims in state court are preempted despite a plaintiffs' victory in the vaccine court, the case will stop at the vaccine court. But, the end results may be no funds left to compensate families for other injuries cause d by other vaccines, vaccine manufacturers possibly leaving the U.S. market anyway, and another pyrrhic victory for personal injury attorneys at the expe nse of public health.
