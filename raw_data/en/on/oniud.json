Their treatments are usually safe but may not be right for every person. Chiropractors attend graduate-level health colleges to treat bones, nerves, muscles, and ligament disorders. While chiropractors are widely known for treating back and neck pain, they also treat bone and soft tissue conditions. In this article, we explore the myths and truths of chiropractic care. We also describe chiropractors' training, the safety of these treatments, and the research behind the practice. A common myth is that chiropractors do not undergo a significant amount of training. In fact, they typically complete about 8 years of higher education before they are licensed. Chiropractors tend to have 4 years of undergraduate education. They usually complete college with a degree in biology or kinesiology after having taken courses in sciences, such as biology, chemistry, psychology, and physics. They then attend a chiropractic graduate program. On average, these involve 4 years of education with a total of 4,200 instructional hours in course credits. Chiropractic program specifics Divided by year, a chiropractic graduate program usually involves: - First year: Courses in general [anatomy](/articles/248743.php), chiropractic principles, biochemistry, and spinal anatomy. - Second year: Courses in chiropractic procedures, pathology, clinical orthopedics, imaging interpretation, and research methods. - Third year: Courses in clinical internships, integrated chiropractic care, pediatrics, dermatology, practice management, and ethics and jurisprudence. - Fourth year: A clinical internship in which a student studies under a chiropractor and completes rotations in a hospital or veterans' clinic. Other studies often accompany those mentioned above. After completing the educational and training requirements, an aspiring chiropractor in the United States will sit for their state licensing board. Once they have obtained licensure and certification from the board, they will become a doctor of chiropractic. Chiropractors often receive additional training and certification in a wide [variety of specialties](http://www.acatoday.org/Communities-Related-Organizations-American-Board-of-Chiropractic-Specialties), including [nutrition](/articles/160774.php), sports medicine, and orthopedic rehabilitation. Another common myth is that a chiropractor merely cracks a person's back or bones. Professionals center chiropractic care around spinal manipulation. However, they also study the spine and how its structures are related to the body's function. What do chiropractors attempt to heal? A majority of a chiropractor's work involves making adjustments to heal: They may also provide services such as postural testing and analysis, as well as others designed to promote nutrition and healthful exercise. Does it work? Research suggests that chiropractic care can effectively relieve various types of acute and chronic pain \u2014 including neck pain, back pain, and certain types of headaches. [Studies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2616395) Patients with back pain who receive chiropractic care may also be [less likely ](https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/21/2/e139/5575223?login=true)to use opioids for pain relief. In clinical [researchers found](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32543211/) People sometimes [use chiropractic care](https://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Abstract/2013/04150/Adding_Chiropractic_Manipulative_Therapy_to.2.aspx) [in conjunction](https://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Abstract/2013/04150/Adding_Chiropractic_Manipulative_Therapy_to.2.aspx) with standard medical care, such as physical therapy, pharmacological treatment, and other therapies. Like other forms of treatment, chiropractic care will not benefit all injuries. Doctors should tailor sessions to a person's needs, and a licensed chiropractor should perform the procedure. Chiropractic treatment may help reduce pain and disability in people with certain acute and chronic conditions, including: Low back pain [Research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2616395) Spinal manipulation therapy is associated with modest improvements in pain and function in patients with acute low back pain. In a [2018 study,](https://media.jamanetwork.com/news-item/clinical-trial-supports-chiropractic-care-as-component-of-care-for-low-back-pain/) Neck pain Neck pain is the second most prevalent health complaint reported by people seeking chiropractic care.

However, doctors should not carry out chiropractic manipulations on joints that are actively inflamed. Asthma Some people with asthma [may benefit](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1479235412000065) from using chiropractic treatment as a complementary therapy, but they should not use it as a replacement for traditional treatment. A [2018 review](https://www.thespinejournalonline.com/article/S1529-9430(18)30016-0/fulltext) included 17 years of studies involving spinal manipulation or mobilization. The studies investigated the effects of these treatments on chronic lower back pain, and the authors concluded that the chiropractic methods were likely to reduce pain and improve function. A [2017 review](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2616395) The [American College of Physicians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28192789) Researchers generally agree that they need more studies to determine the ideal length and frequency of chiropractic sessions and to identify what injuries may benefit from specific treatments. One of the most common sources of contention regarding chiropractic treatments concerns safety. A person may experience side effects of spinal manipulation, including: There have been occasional reports of long-term danger related to chiropractic care. The [ European Spine Journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3087049/) According to the American Chiropractic Association, most discomfort and soreness subsides within [24 hours](http://www.amhchiropractic.com/frequently-asked-questions) of spinal manipulation. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that it is unsafe for people with certain health conditions to undergo chiropractic manipulation. These conditions [include](http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf) - bone disease and infections - broken bones - inflamed joints, such as in cases of [rheumatoid arthritis](http://medicalnewstoday.com/info/rheumatoid-arthritis/) - some [circulation problems](https://www.healthline.com/health/poor-circulation-symptoms-causes) - infections of the nervous system An aspiring chiropractor must spend thousands of hours studying before obtaining a license. In 2020, an estimated [51,400](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/mobile/chiropractors.htm) chiropractors were practicing in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Chiropractic care is a drug-free, non-invasive, and affordable form of therapy that may treat some musculoskeletal problems. While this form of alternative medicine may not benefit everyone, professionals generally consider it to be safe for most people. "}
