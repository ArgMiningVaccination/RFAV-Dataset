Then we get sick. Achilles had his heel problem. Superman his allergy to kryptonite. Dylan his pericarditis (and worse, no words that rhymed with it). And our reaction to sickness -- be it interstitial or interstellar in nature -- is not a battle cry, but denial, then some creative profanity, then surrender. Well, fellas, that plan is obsolete. You can beat any ailment -- actually hold it at arm's length while it snaps at the air like a baby bulldog in a Tom & Jerry short. We've assembled a group of men who have done just that to their worst health problems. The guys have one thing in common: They took control of their situations, found their own help, and found a way back. Are they medical miracles? Nope, just regular guys with great stories who want to show how you, too, can kick the tail of what ails you. How He Beat It: Rock climbing At age 63, George Knorr was the stereotypical old man shuffling down the street, holding his back. On the worst days, he'd go 50 feet before he'd have to stop to let the pain subside. His doctor diagnosed arthritis and recommended Tylenol. His chiropractor twisted him like origami for a full year. \"And my back still didn't feel any better,\" he says. Then his son opened a climbing gym in his hometown of Reading, Pennsylvania, and Knorr watched men of all ages pulling themselves up the walls. One day, he reached up, grabbed a handhold, and hung from it. \"My back didn't hurt any more than it already did. So I kept doing it,\" he says. After 2 weeks of hanging out, his back felt good enough to do easy climbs two or three times a week. After a few months, the pain was gone. Now a spry 69-year-old, Knorr still climbs. And walks. And runs. \"I can do anything,\" he says. Make It Work for You: \"Stretching is the bottom line for beating back pain,\" says Ronald Lawrence, M.D., founder of the American Medical Athletic Association. \"By climbing, George stretched muscles he would never have stretched otherwise.\" And he did it right -- started slowly, saw results, and then upped his workouts. To get the same benefit (without wearing a harness), Dr. Lawrence recommends this wake-up stretch: Lie on your back and bring your right knee to your chest, clasping your ankle. Hold for a 10-count. Straighten your leg and repeat with the left leg, then do both legs at once. How He Beat It: Tomato juice and cayenne pepper Jerome Kotch, 55, stews in his share of daily stress as a bank examiner for the Federal Reserve (no, he doesn't know Alan). Fifteen years ago, the Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, resident was diagnosed with high blood pressure (147/95) during a routine physical. His doctor put him on a diuretic blood-pressure pill, hydrochlorothiazide. Only problem: \"It made me dizzy, and I'd feel like I was about to pass out,\" he says. After follow-up blood work showed that the diuretic was lowering Kotch's potassium and magnesium levels, his doctor prescribed supplements to take with the medication. But Kotch still felt like a man without a floor under him. Fed up, he stopped all the pill popping and tried a natural remedy: tomato juice and cayenne pepper. \"It's an acquired taste,\" says Kotch. But after only a month, the spicy new cocktail had lowered his blood pressure. Kotch now walks and bikes regularly, and his BP checks in at a robust 123/80. Make It Work for You: Before you agree to go on blood-pressure medicines, ask your doctor if you can try Kotch's daily concoction: 8 ounces of low-sodium V8 juice with a teaspoon of cayenne (stirred well). \"There are probably three reasons why it worked,\" says Joe D. Goldstrich, M.D., F.A.C.C., a cardiologist in Henderson, Nevada. First, cayenne delivers capsaicin--the \"heat\" in peppers--which has been found to have some positive effect on blood pressure. Also, the antioxidant punch of the lycopene in the tomatoes could knock out free radicals, an excess of which can raise blood pressure. And then there's the high potassium content of tomato juice. \"Potassium tends to take the place of sodium in the body's tissues,\" says Dr. Goldstrich. Too much sodium can cause arterial walls to retain water, boosting BP. How He Beat It: His imagination Wigging out is no picnic. Wigging out in high school, on a bus to a football game, coming this close to screaming, \"Stop the bus!\" is excruciating. That was the moment when Terry Welch, now a 31-year-old communications specialist in Kansas City, Missouri, realized that his claustrophobia was beyond his control. But professional help wasn't wired into his thinking. \"I grew up in a small town in Kansas,\" he says. \"You didn't go to a psychologist for your problem. You rubbed some dirt on it and moved on.\" One night while he was bathing -- in a small bathroom with no windows -- panic creptin again . . . and Welch decided to try something radical. He shut the lights off and stuffed a towel under the door, creating a pitch-black environment where, for 15 minutes at a clip, he could pretend he was in smaller and smaller rooms. If he started to wig, he flipped the light on, and the bathroom would seem like an auditorium. After 8 months of on-and-off \"self-treatment,\" he started to feel better. The big test came when he joined the navy and had no trouble sleeping aboard the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln -- an aircraft carrier with three-deep \"coffin racks.\" Make It Work for You: Working with a doctor is advisable, of course, but \"if somebody practices control, he can get over his phobia,\" says Harold Levinson, M.D., a psychiatrist and author of Phobia Free. According to Dr. Levinson, the key is training yourself to recognize and adapt to your anxiety triggers. That's what Welch did, albeit unknowingly. \"Bathrooms and tubs are enclosed spaces. By turning off the light, he allowed his apprehensions to escalate. By concentrating on these apprehensions, he lessened his anxiety,\" says Dr. Levinson. How He Beat It: Kitty tranquilizers Tom Kasle couldn't be in the same room with the family cat -- and it wasn't because he's a dog person. Sneezing, mucus, itching -- Kasle had it all. \"My allergist couldn't give me shots, so we had to get rid of our cat,\" says Kasle, a 49-year-old from Maumee, Ohio. \"My wife and daughter were devastated.\" Seeing this heartbreak -- caused by a condition he couldn't control -- made Kasle try a different strategy: Treat the cat, not the human. He'd heard about a diluted sedative you could add to your cat's food to help fight severe allergies. Playing the odds, Kasle adopted a new cat and doped its water daily. After 4 weeks, Kasle felt better. These days, he can sit near Puss with nary a sneeze. Make It Work for You: Hit up your vet for the animal tranquilizer acepromazineH2O ($12 for a month's supply). \"It changes the chemical composition of the cat's saliva, making its dander less allergenic,\" says William Lutz, D.V.M., a veterinarian in private practice in Whitehouse, Ohio. But won't Kitty become a stumbling junkie? Absolutely not, says Dr. Lutz. \"The tranquilizer is so diluted that the cat's day-to-day activity and mood are unaffected.\" Unfortunately, however, acepromazine doesn't work with dogs. For them, try Allerpet D, a dry shampoo (no rinsing needed) available in most pet stores. How He Beat It: Cutting back on carbohydrates Every afternoon, as the northern California shadows grew long, Matt Mitchell suffered. On good days, it felt as if a pro wrestler were sitting on his head. On bad days, the 24-year-old lay in a darkened room, waiting for the pain to stop. But almost every day, the migraines returned. His doctor ran tests (all with normal results), and eventually prescribed high-dosage Tylenol. It didn't help. A year ago, the woman he was dating asked the 275-pound Mitchell to join her on a low-carb diet she wanted to try. Not cool -- at first. \"I love to cook Italian food,\" says Mitchell. \"I knew what that meant.\" But he gave it a shot. After 2 weeks of pasta deprivation, the migraines disappeared. \"I didn't put two and two together at first,\" he says. \"Then one night I tried a piece of cheesecake. Bam. Migraine.\" A big bonus: Mitchell also ended up losing 70 pounds. Make It Work for You: Relax. You don't need to swear off carbohydrates, but you can't keep bingeing on them, either. Mitchell's bread-and-beer habit may have triggered migraines by keeping his blood sugar on a perpetual roller-coaster ride, says Lisa K. Mannix, M.D., a neurologist in private practice in Cincinnati, Ohio. \"Migraines are a chronic disorder. If you have them, you'll always be susceptible. But consistency of lifestyle is a key to holding them off.\" In addition to the dramatically fluctuating blood-sugar levels, all those extra carbohydrates created another migraine trigger for Mitchell: obesity. Excess weight increases the risk of sleep apnea, a nighttime breathing disorder that causes daytime headaches. If you have migraines, try limiting your carbohydrate intake to no more than 300 grams per day. How He Beat It: Metamucil Joe Drozd was hardly an unfit 44-year-old: He regularly lifted weights, played basketball, and actually enjoyed yard work. His diet was essentially healthy. But that wasn't enough; high cholesterol ran in his father's bloodlines, so it runs in Drozd's blood, too. After a November 1999 test, his total cholesterol came in at 232, and his LDL -- the stuff that turns arteries into the equivalent of salami -- simmered at 123. Enter Metamucil. Drozd's wife, Shelley, had been taking it for more than 10 years as a fiber supplement, and her cholesterol readings always came in well below normal (128 total, last time it was checked), which Joe found strange. \"We eat the same foods,\" he says. \"My doctor told me that medication was the next step, so I decided to give Metamucil a try.\" The plan: 1 tablespoon dissolved in a glass of water daily. Six months later, Drozd returned to the doc. His new readings: 189 total and 96 LDL, a combined 25 percent drop. Make It Work for You: Metamucil is the brand name for psyllium husk, a natural plant fiber. While it's known as a laxative, psyllium also mops up cholesterol and carries it out with the rest of the refuse. \"Psyllium binds with the bile acids that form cholesterol, a process that keeps them from reabsorbing into your blood,\" says Ruth Patrick, Ph.D., a professor emeritus of nutrition at Louisiana State University. Research has shown that people who add psyllium to their diets reduce both their total and harmful LDL cholesterol by up to 15 percent -- while keeping protective HDL levels intact. The FDA recommends 7 grams of psyllium a day, exactly the amount Drozd takes. How He Beat It: Water Alex Mutzak had smoked hard since he was 14 years old. He estimates that if he used nicotine patches to quit, he'd need \"five or six an hour.\" So he never tried. Then, at age 23, he started having chest pains. After some x-rays, Mutzak learned he had fluid in his left lung. His doctor gave him two options: Quit smoking, or drown internally. Mutzak chose to drown -- but in a far different sense. He went cold turkey, and anytime he craved a butt, he drank water. And cravings carpet bombed him. \"You should see the backseat of my car,\" he says. \"I have the biggest collection of empty bottles anywhere.\" Still, those 10 24-ounce bottles a day kept him from lighting up. And with time, his cravings evaporated. He cleaned his ashtray in January 2002 and hasn't used it since. Make It Work for You: Mutzak used a basic kick-the-addiction technique called substitution, according to Tom Horvath, Ph.D., a psychologist specializing in addiction and author of Sex, Drugs, Gambling, and Chocolate. In essence, Mutzak replaced his craving for cigarettes with a craving for water -- not the water itself, but the hand-to-mouth act of drinking it. \"People can develop secondary addictions this way,\" says Horvath. \"But a water addiction is definitely better than cigarettes.\" So if you're trying to kick the habit, find a sensible sub. Reaching for water, or lollipops, or exercise -- which all of our experts recommend -- every time you feel the urge will keep you puffing in a better way than you are now. How He Beat It: Optical calisthenics Twenty-six-year-old Orlin Sorensen dreamed of flying combat missions like his grandfather, but his 20/80 eyesight kept him below standards for naval flight training (20/30, no glasses or surgeries allowed). Commercial airlines, however, aren't as strict -- for several years, Sorensen flew for Horizon Air while wearing glasses. Then came September 11, leaving the airline industry decimated and Sorensen flying a lot less. \"I was bummed, but I decided to try to turn my life around,\" he says. He used the time to put a curiosity to the test: Can a man improve his vision by \"exercising\" his eyes? Inspired by World War II fighter pilots who used vision-training exercises, and by a 1920 book by Dr. William Bates (The Bates Method for Better Eyesight without Glasses), Sorensen stockpiled information until he had enough exercises to begin his own program. \"I trained my eyes to do things they don't normally do,\" Sorensen says. \"I treated the program like physical exercise.\" He \"worked out\" 25 minutes a day, 6 days a week, for 30 days, doing exercises like slowly rolling his eyes in a full circle. The results? The navy measured his vision at 20/30, he no longer needs glasses, and he's been accepted for pilot training. Make It Work for You: Improving your sight by retraining your eye muscles is \"very doable,\" says William Moskowitz, F.C.O.V.D., an optometrist who has helped scores of patients with vision training at the Park Vision Therapy Center in Bridgewater, New Jersey. But since different vision problems require different programs, Dr. Moskowitz recommends you consult a behavioral optometrist. (Find one who's board certified in vision therapy, at covd.org/membersearch. php.) After you're matched up with the right program, the follow-through is up to you -- you have to do the exercises every day. How He Beat It: Superstition Alan Jamison was a young drunk. His poison of choice? \"Anything. I was under 21,\" he says. By the time he graduated from high school, Jamison's GPA had dwindled from 3.9 to 2.2; his all-state soccer career was stalled; and his shot at a national teen weight-lifting title (he benched 385 at age 15) gave way to \"the party,\" as he calls it. The Phoenix resident didn't see this as a problem, however, until he started drinking alone. Then he knew it was time to stop, which he did, cold, at age 19. Starting out was difficult. He didn't have a lot of friends he could talk to, and anyone older chalked up his problems to teenage angst. One morning Jamison attempted to climb Squaw Peak, a part of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve in Arizona. After a few successful ascents, he began alternating with nearby Camelback. Soon, the climbs -- both about a mile and a half up switchbacks -- became mandatory for Jamison. \"If I didn't climb, I knew I'd have a bad day,\" he says. \"I'd feel like going back to drinking.\" But he never did. He just kept climbing. Now he's 30 years old, married, the father of a 3-year-old son, and stone-cold sober for 11 years. Make It Work for You: \"It's all about taking your recovery into your own hands and using your own will to end your addiction,\" says G. Alan Marlatt, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Washington. Yes, that's contrary to the AA philosophy of powerlessness, but for some alcoholics, it may be better to climb mountains than AA's 12 Steps. If you choose to go the DIY route, Marlatt recommends finding an activity that will give you the same benefits Jamison's climbing gave him: a good frame of mind first thing in the morning, a diversion from the booze, and a firm belief that it will help you stay on the wagon. (Exercise should be a top candidate, since the endorphin rush Jamison experienced from climbing may have helped replace the physical pleasure of drinking.) Warning: If your activity doesn't keep you sober for 90 days, it's time to ask for help. How He Beat It: Acupuncture John Martin suffered what he calls \"seasonal\" insomnia, which corresponded with allergy season and stressful periods at his Internet marketing job in Manhattan. He'd go to bed and just lie there. He tried Benadryl for the allergies, but that sped him up. He popped a prescription sleeping pill (Ambien), but it left him \"fuzzed out.\" He stared at the ceiling for years. \"It was exhausting,\" he says. \"The sleeplessness built on itself and went on and on.\" Finally, a doctor friend of Martin's suggested acupuncture. The first time, he says, was creepy: \"Someone is actually leaning over you and sticking you with pins.\" For the first few minutes, Martin was skeptical, but soon -- and involuntarily -- he became more relaxed. The evening after the second session, he slept better than he had in weeks. As Martin continued his treatments -- twice a week for 3 weeks -- his sack time continued to improve and his allergies lessened. These days, Martin goes for maintenance jabs once every few weeks, but his insomnia is gone. Make It Work for You: Don't like needles? Don't worry, says Christopher Trahan, O.M.D., a licensed acupuncturist and doctor of oriental medicine in New York City. \"Acupuncture needles aren't hypodermic needles. They're superthin, almost like filament, and sterilized. It's not going to hurt, and there's generally no bleeding.\" For insomnia treatment, acupuncturists usually focus on two main points on your ears that induce relaxation. \"Acupuncture enhances the release of calming endorphins and neurotransmitters in the brain,\" says Dr. Trahan. The time it takes to achieve results varies, but even severe insomnia sufferers usually see improvement within 10 treatments. (The need for maintenance sessions also varies.) Find a licensed acupuncturist at aaom.org, the Web site of the American Association of Oriental Medicine. How He Beat It: Wholesale lifestyle changes In November 2000, Ted Heath was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Heath heard about all the traditional options from his urologist: radiation therapy, radical prostatectomy, radioactive-seed implantation . . . and the impotence and incontinence that might be included gratis. None guaranteed success, and none sounded better than the cancer itself. \"If there was a way to take care of it by natural means, I wanted to try,\" says the 56-year-old from San Rafael, California. Heath's doctor mentioned that Dean Ornish, M.D., founder of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, California, was conducting a study to see if prostate cancer could be slowed, stopped, or reversed with lifestyle changes. Heath applied for the study and was accepted in May 2001. His old lifestyle gave way to a fourfold program of moderate exercise (minimum of 3 hours a week), a low-fat diet (with no animal products), stress management (yoga and meditation), and group support (talking with similarly afflicted men). The results after 15 dedicated months? Heath dropped 50 pounds (from 215 to 165). More important, he dropped his prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) levels-- high levels can be a harbinger of cancer activity in the gland--from 9.5 to 3.47 (2 to 4 is normal). Staying on Dr. Ornish's program and having annual MRIs and semiannual PSA tests for the rest of his life is just fine by Heath, since the quality of that life is better than he ever expected. Make It Work for You: While there's still no cure for cancer, lifestyle changes may help arrest it. \"We are encouraged by our results,\" says Ruth Marlin, M.D., medical director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute. (Dr. Ornish presented their findings at the second International Scientific Conference on Complementary, Alternative and Integrative Medical Therapies last May.) One key is eating fewer total and saturated fats, which can aid tumor growth (though researchers don't know why). Also, phytonutrients in vegetables may inhibit cancer growth and aid in apoptosis (cancer cells killing each other off). As for the exercise, stress reduction, and peer support, Dr. Marlin notes that they help improve immune-system function. If you face prostate cancer, have elevated PSAs, or have a family history of the disease, read up on cancer -fighting lifestyle changes at pmri.org and capcure.org (click on \"Take Charge\"), then fill your doctor in on the strategies you'd like to try. How He Beat It: Burning it out On his 10th wedding anniversary, Thomas J. Harbin, Ph.D., a Fayetteville, North Carolina, clinical psychologist, gained a new patient: himself. \"That day my wife said, 'If the next 10 years are going to be like the last 10, I'm leaving,'\" he recalls. Harbin's chronic anger -- a problem since he was a child -- had finally reached the point where even he could no longer deny the problem. \"I never got physical, and I never broke things,\" he says. \"I just got into brutal arguments.\" As a Ph.D., Harbin was savvy enough to know that his anger was not something he could resolve in an afternoon. So, short-term, he did the best thing he could: He walked away when he knew an argument was brewing. He also began exercising intensely. Long-term, he started writing what would become Beyond Anger: A Guide for Men. The book, in effect, became his therapist. \"Writing helped me organize my thoughts and realize my own problems,\" he says. Now 48, Harbin specializes in anger therapy. He's treated more than a hundred chronically angry men, is much more happily married, and knows firsthand what boils inside tens of millions of men like him. Make It Work for You: \"Anyone can get mad at being cut off in traffic,\" says Harbin. \"But when you start taking it personally, as if the other driver has something against you, that's a problem.\" There's only one immediate solution when you feel the rage boiling: \"Just walk away,\" says Harbin. \"It's the best option until you learn how to control your anger more effectively.\" After that, flush the anger from your system with exercise and writing. You know how to do the former; for the latter, what are you afraid of? Making a list of what pisses you off can illuminate the real anger beneath--just shred what you write afterward. If you're still popping veins, Harbin suggests bringing in a pro. "}
