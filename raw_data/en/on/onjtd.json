L' auteur conserve There is a Sankofa voice being raised as a signal to search for the knowledge and wisdom of African ancestors/ancestresses. This study is a contribution to search for African identity and culture - something we have almost lost due to foreign influences. But these foreign influences are eating us up, making us bitter and frustrated. The Obosom Tigare was brought from Niapala in the Upper Region to Nsiakrom as an agricultural cult but today it has become one of the \"African indigenous religious movement\" striving for the African \"discovery and \"recovery \" of cultural values. In retaining the Akan cultural and religious traditions, it is one of the most powerful African cults in Ghana expressing the Akan practical needs. Also, it deals with new social problems. In order to preserve continuity and cohesion the cult has retained part of the old Akan traditions and added modern traditions to them. The pattern of religious behaviour involved in Obosom Tigare cult is similar many respects to that of the ancestral spirits and natural deities of the Akan. It has become a tool for Akan cultural survival and explains that religion goes beyond mere relation between human beings and super human beings. This study emphasizes an \"insider\" methodology which I define as auditory, visual, and kinesthetic. In the auditory method, the researcher does not only listen but becomes part of the religious community. The visual method enables me to look at religion in the \"raw\" that is, to look at what people do as well as what people say, and thus to come terms with religion as it is lived. The kinesthetic method allows me to participate in the ceremonies through drumming, dancing, and singing. Sometimes I accompanied Okomfo Afua Nsiah to the bush to search for herbal medicines. Through these and other methodologies | tried, as - much as possible to adopt the indigenes' point of view. Written by someone who is an 11 indigenous speaker, a Christian minister, as well as an anthropologist, this is a unique exploration of how Obosom Tigare acts, speaks, and responds to human needs. Using the Obosom Tigare of Nsiakrom as a case study, this work shows how indigenous healers have important advantages as biomedical healers and that Ghana is tapping some of these advantages in order to solve some of her medical problems. lil Acknowledgement Many people have contributed in diverse ways to this study and that it is difficult to thank and acknowledge all in this small space.

This was a statement made by Osei Bonsu the king of Asante nation in 1876 to Rev. Thomas Picota Methodist missionary, after missionary efforts had failed to produce significant results. The latter was pleading with the Asante king to do all that he could to facilitate mission work in his kingdom. This plea was necessary, he felt, because the indigenes firmly decided not to support any missionary work being initiated in their communities. According to the indigenes Abosom, unlike Christianity and Islamic religions, dealt with Akan life in all its circumstances and therefore must be protected against the alien religions. The question is, what role did Abosom play in the life of the ancient Akan people, and what role do they play in our contemporary Akan society? This question reminds me of my own personal prohlem, for which I have been searching for an answer. Before I began my career in the Christian ministry over two decades ago, my late grandma, Adwoa Kyema, invited me to her small chamber and asked me to kneel down before her. While I was kneeling, she spat on the floor and mixed the saliva with the dust there. After that she ordered me to dip my fingers into it and rub three times on my forehead. J did it as she directed. She then said: Fa Me Nhyira ko, \"Go with my blessing!\" Though I was puzzled and did not understand what it meant, I was not bold 2 enough to ask my grandma the meaning of the ritual. This is because in the Akan tradition, the \"youngs\" should not question elders on such issues. I have been thinking about this event until now. The questions I have been asking are: what was the meaning of this ritual? Was this ritual useless as a Christian might say? Would my dear grandma do something to me that was worthless? If not, did it have any impact on my life that I was not aware of at the time? The question that confronts modern Akan is similar: do Abosom have any role to play in our world today? Are they relevant to our times? This is the question this study asks. The purpose of this research then is to investigate the role Abosom play in Akan communities by probing into Obosom Tigare in Nsiakrom of Ghana as a case study. 1-2 Theories of Abosom What are the Akan Abosom? Many anthropologists and other social scientists have attempted to find answers to this question. I will devote these pages to examine some of the theories to find out whether they have been able to provide an adequate explanation of what Abosom mean to indigenes. I shall limit myself to three main theories \u2014 \"fetishism\", \"animism\" and \"valuable\" which will represent what I will term as \"outsiders\" and \"insiders\" views. Fetishism and animism will represent \"outsiders\" and will be contrasted with the valuable that will depict the \"insiders\". The reason for examining fetishism and animism is that these are the academic theories which have had the most enduring effects on attitudes to Abosom even after the demise of evolutionism at the beginning of the 20\" century. For example, cultic functionaries who serve in the Abosom shrines are usually labelled as \"fetish priests/priestesses\" in the 3 literature, whereas their counterparts in the Christian religion are called \"pastors\" or \"ministers\". Not only are the cultic functionaries labelled fetish but also all Akan religious objects. In the Valuable theory I will state the views of the indigenes- Okomfo Afua Nsiah, practitioners, patients and myself as an Akan and a Methodist clergy. In this comparison, I want to set out my limitations. What comparison means to me in this context is to investigate how far Abosom have been expressed in terms of social relationships. I will not mention individual names primarily as [ am not concerned with individuals per se but in the social groups they represent. It was Charles de Brosses who first propounded the theory of fetishism. He coined the term fetish in 1760 to describe his own theory of the earliest stages of man's religious evolution. He based this theory on the Portuguese discovery of what they called feitco \u2014 images on the West African Coast, which included the talisman, charms and amulets worn by the coastal people with whom the Portuguese came into contact. Charles de Brosses took these objects to be \"objects of worship\" rather than \"symbols of worship\". Adewale corrected this error when he stated: The West African traditional religion has been given many wrong names either partly as a result of ignorance or partly as a result of prejudice. Ignorance, because many foreign investigators have wrong ideas about the religion. Very often they take appearance for reality, they confuse religion and culture and finally they compare the African religion with their religion or with other religions (Adewale 1989: 12) Parrinder also remarks that fetishism has \"come to be confused with the worship of gods and veneration of ancestors\" (Parrinder 1962: 15). However, this theory has influenced many 4 scholars. For instance, the French philosopher Auguste Comte, in his three-fold religious pyramid, puts monotheism at the top, polytheism in the middle and fetishism at the bottom (Parrinder. 1961: 12). Similarly, Tylor's theory of human evolution and culture (mid19 century) places animism as the initial stage of mankind's religious evolution, which is said to develop into polytheism and finally monotheism (Parrinder 1962:12). In the same way, in grading the world religions the African traditional religion is put at the bottom of the supposed ladder of religious evolution with Judaism, Christianity and Islam at the top, presumably because they are monotheistic. Charles de Brosses has influenced scholars such as Bossman, Ellis, Eva and Williamson all who studied Akan religion and this influence has filtered down into Akan society. In the world of Ghana today, judges and lawyers habitually address indigenes as fetishists or animists in oath swearing in courts. The general notion is that this class of people bow down in worship to objects \"animated\" by their various anima and not to a personalised deity (Parrinder 1962: 14). Bossman, a Dutch scholar, argues that there are so many images in human and animals forms in Akan religion that it can be characterised as \"idol worship\" (Nti 1978: 103). Though there are images of human forms in Akan religion, and objects like water, trees, stones, pots, axes, reptiles, may be found in the various temples or shrines, these are not worshipped. As Parrrinder says: Now the religion of the African peoples is not the worship or the use of the work of man's hand. It is known today that no 'heathen in his blindness bows down to wood and stone '. 5 The heathen worships a spiritual being who may be approached through material object' (Parrinder 1976: 15). Thus none of these symbols or shrines is worshipped in and of itself. They are not \"fetishes\" though the ignorant may call them such. The so-called image or idol is therefore different from the Obosom it represents, and should not be identified with it, an error which Bossman was unable to avoid. A. B. Ellis, a British colonial administrator who served in Africa in the late nineteenth century, holds the view that the Akan word Obosom appears to be two components, namely Bo (to form) or (to make) and essum which means (mishap or calamity). The two components put together form Bo-essum, literally mean \"producer of calamity or evil\". In other words, the Abosom are said to be phenomena that bring evil upon its adherents. He further concludes that the Akan concept of Nyankopong is borrowed from the Europeans (Ellis 1887: 18). Ellis' attempt to label Akan religion as the worship of malevolent spirits which only wrought disaster on their adherents shows that he was a superficial observer who did not make a proper study of the Akan people and their religion. His knowledge of the indigenes' language is questionable. It appears to me that he had very little knowledge of the indigenous' language. And by stating that the Akan concept of Onyankopong was borrowed from the Europeans, he clearly demonstrates an ethnocentrism typical of observers of his age. Moreover, his theory is unacceptable to traditional Akan worshippers. Eva Meyerowitz argues that the Akan word Abosom comes from word Bosome, which means the \"moon\". From this premise she builds her argument that the Akan ancestors/ancestries 6 initially were Bosom-som that is, \"moon-worshippers\". She explains that in the past the spirit of the moon-goddess possessed women, and that those who were possessed by the spirit gave birth to Bosom-mma (children of the moon). Through the spirit of the moon these women established themselves as Mma-mpayinfo (Elderly women) and ruled over a number of people. She concludes that this moon-goddess sometimes disguises itself in animal-shape such as, leopard, falcon, antelope and leads the ancestors to the waterside when they are thirsty, and teaches them how to prepare food when they are hungry. Also, it brings them fire to warm themselves, and provides them magical power that helps them to escape from enemies in times of war. These animals eventually became the Akan Akyene-mmoa (totems), meaning \"an (Meyerowitz 1960: 27). Meyerowitz was an art tutor in the mid 1950s at Achimota College, Ghana, who later turned to write about Akan religion. Her theory is based on an actual Akan legend. This Akan legend says: The ancients tell us that as the Akan, the Children of Anowa, progressed south from northern Africa toward the savannah and the Atlantic, they became thirsty and there was no water for miles around. With them was a priestess named Eku who had a dog. They came upon a lake, but they were frightened to drink the water lest it was poisonous. Eku let her dog drink of the water. Nothing happened to the dog. Then Eku herself, as leader, tried to prove to the people that the water was drinkable. She drank and nothing happened to her. Whereupon all the people shouted 'Eku aso' (Eku has tasted) and they ran forward to drink. The place where the incident happened is known to this day as Eku Eso (Oduyoye 1995: 8). There are Akan stories about women playing important roles in the life of the communities. For example, Yaa Asantewaa led the Ashantis and fought against the British in 1900. Meyerowitz might have been influenced by these stories and used them to formulate her theory of Abosom. It is not the animals and plants per se to which the indigenes attach the maximum of holiness, \"but to their representations the totemic symbols\" (Durkheim 1965: 245). Also, it is true that Africans revered the \"moon\" in times past. For there are some African communities, when they first see the moon, they hail and ask it to bestow life and plenty. Among African peoples like the Bambuti, Dorobo, Luo and Sandawe, the moon is personified as a female deity. Geoffrey Parrinder notes that the Fon of Dahomey salute the moon when it appears fresh in the sky by pouring libations and lifting up their new-born babies to the moon for blessing, prosperity and long life (Parrinder 1969: 49). Similarly, Ten Raa implies that the Akan pray to the moon when he states: Nana, me hu wo a me nya nkwoo! Ma yen ahoden Ma yen sika Ma yen nam Ma yen nkwa tenten. English Text: Grandfather (sacred moon) when I see you I have life Give us strength Give us wealth Give us meat Give us long life (Ten Raa 1969: 24). According to Smith, when Ngombe of the Northern Congo, like the Akan, see the new moon, men look up to it, raising the right hand and then the left-hand saying: The New Moon shines, I show thee my right hand, I show thee my left hand, If I go for fishing with thee may I kill many? If I look for money with thee may I get much money (Smith 1961: 177)? It is believed the Igbo people of Nigeria have similar respect for the moon. Chinua Achebe reports that when the moon appears in the sky their chief priest takes a short staff from his shrine and hits the earth with the following prayer: Ulu, I thank you for making me see another new moon. May I see it again and again. This household may it be wealthy and prosperous. As this is the moon of planting may the six villages plant with profit. May we escape danger in the farm \u2014 the bite of a snake or the sting of the scorpion, the mighty one of the scrubland. May we not cut our shinbone with the machete or the hoe. And let our wives bear male children. May we increase in numbers at the next counting of the villages so that we shall sacrifice to you cow, not a chicken as we did after the last New Year feast. May children put their fathers into the earth and not fathers their children. May good meet the face of every man and 9 every woman. Let it come to the land of the riverain folk and the land of the forest peoples (Chinua Achebe 1974: 6). No doubt, the Akan like the Igbo, believe that the moon has some spiritual impact in their lives. Women reckon their menstrual cycles and pregnancy with the appearance and disappearance of the moon. The moon as a phenomenon generally stands for their concept of immortality and fertility, but this is not to suggest that there is a cult of the moon and that the Akan Abosom is derived from it. Another investigator, Williamson, struggles with the etymology of the word Abosom. His explanation is that Abosom comes from two Akan root words - Obo and Som. According to Williamson Obo in Akan means \"rock\" or \"stones\", and Som means \"to serve\" or \"worship\" and so Obosom literally means the \"worship\" or \"serving\" stones or rocks (Williamson 1965: 89). I find Williamson's theory to be problematic because there are some Abosom that are in the form of natural phenomena such as a tree, a river, a mountain, a lake, the ocean, and a hill. Others are in the form animal bones, balls, calabashes brass pans and so on. According to the practitioners they contact the Abosom in these concrete habitations, though they know that the Abosom are not confined therein. Mbiti clearly emphasizes this when he writes: Where some natural phenomena or objects are personified, or thought to be inhabited by spiritual beings, it is not possible that people may address their prayers to them. In such cases, the prayers are addressed to the 'divinity' or 'spirits' and not the object or phenomenon as such (Mbiti 1971: 233). Speaking of the role of trees in Tonga religion, Henri Junod makes similar observation when he 10 states: When travelling through the country, you may come across a tree round which a rag has been tied, evidently for some religious purpose. One's first idea would be that this tree is worshipped, but this is by no means the case. In fact I have never met any worship offered to plant as such (Junod 1927: 332). The Akan Obo (stone) is a very ancient word, which symbolises steadfastness, timeless, immunity, and truth. For example, Plaetvoet Asantehene Osei Bonsu who appeared to Obosom Tano and asked for his help against the rebellious Gyamanhene Adinkra in late 1817. The Obosom Tano foretold him that: The Asante would first see a male and a female beings at the war-front, and he warned the warriors not to kill these two people. When the armies met, the Asante did see the pair, and eventually the Asante defeated Gyaman in the war. After the war the Asantehene presented Obosom Tano 'nokwabo', (a stone of truth)' (Warren & Brempong 1971: 125). The Akan expression Wo bo nie, \"here lies your stone\" literally means \"what you said have come to pass\". Whatever the etymology, Abosom are not always in the form of stones or rocks. And in fact, as Pobee has indicated, one of the most popular and widely recognised Abosom in Akan society \u2014 Bosomtwe, Tano, Bea \u2014 1s definitely not in the form of a stone; Bosomtwe is a lake, Tano and Bea are rivers, and Bosompo is the ocean (Pobee 1979: 47). It is very strange to me as an Akan that the Akan people should call their own religion with a name so absurd \u2014 \"the worship of rocks\". I may be right to conclude that Williamson's label is not only a form of 1] ridicule, but also gives the impression that Akan people are \"children\" and therefore need fatherly care (see Bekye 1991: 60). The second important theory applied to the Akan is the \"High-god theory\", which Andrew Lang (1909) opposes to animism. Lang postulates that a belief in spirits and deities is found in every primitive society and from this he hypothesises that these spirits must have an absolute ruler who takes control in the spiritual realm. From this premise Lang draws his theory of a High-god. To him, the High-god is supposed to live in the sky and is clearly not a soul-like being. He is, however, eternal, omniscient, and omnipotent without ever abusing his power. He acts as the founder of moral law, rewards the good and punishes the wicked by disease and death. People do not worship him in temples or through images, but address him in spontaneous, unstereotyped prayer and offer him first fruits as a tribute of adoration in the frame of mind of ghost-worshippers offering food to the souls of the departed. He concludes that the concept of High-God evolves from human desire for an explanation of origins, which naturally stimulated the conception of a Maker or Creator (Lang 1909: 254). The Akan people are believed to have a concept of a High-god, which indeed exhibits many features of Lang's definition. For example, the Akan believe in a being called Obodee (Creator), but have no temples dedicated to him. To them, \"to speak to the Obodee is to speak to the wind\" (Abraham 1969: 80). Though the Akan people believe in such a being depicting \"High\" it is debatable, as we will see, whether \"it is a god\". Today, Lang's theory of a High-god has attracted followers particularly from African Christian scholars. Christian scholars like, Mbiti, Idowu, Dickson, Bediako and many others, use 12 the High-god concept to reconstruct African religion in the image of Christianity and deny any indigenous religion whose cosmology is remote from that of Christianity and which does not worship One Supreme Being. The Akan Abosom, they equate with Obonsam (devil) which destroys humanity. Not only do they condemn Abosom as phenomena per se, but also all things connected with them are classified as demons and they seriously attack ideas and representations of them. During my fieldwork, I came across cases in which Christians destroyed Abosom temples, shrines, and the drums. When I asked one pastor why he destroyed the drums, he argued: \"Akomfotwene and Akomnwom (African songs and drums) are machinery through which satanic forces are liberated\". The Christian Churches in collaboration with government officials have made laws to outlaw so-called Abosom practices. As Busia puts it: No Christian shall be called upon to perform any fetish rites or service, but shall be bound to render customary service to his chiefon ceremonial occasions when no element of fetish practice is involved (Busia 1954: 207). But this is only one side of the picture; the other side is very positive. In the Independent Churches the Akan drums and songs serve as vehicles for the continuity of traditional beliefs and practices. These churches, consciously or unconsciously, provide an important medium for the continuity and regeneration of African traditional beliefs and practices. Their emphasis upon taboo, polygamy, divination, healing, exorcism, drumming and dancing, and trance-like states and their theories of misfortune have African traditional roots (Hackett 1991: 140). In my fieldwork among the Akan I saw some Christian ministers and government officials soliciting help from Abosom by performing libation at the opening of schools, hospitals, and all other 13 government buildings. This is a clear indication that Abosom still do have an important role in Akan communities and that accommodation with Christianity 1s possible. All these theories have thrown some lights on the Akan Abosom, but I think there is the need to interpret the phenomenon from the standpoint of the practitioners themselves and not merely that of the outside observers. I will therefore add the third theory. The third theory, which I call the insiders' view, is the \"Valuable\" theory. This originates from the indigenes themselves. The Akan oral tradition has it that Akumfi-Amayaw, the Paramount Chief of the Techiman Traditional, claimed that the name Obosom (singular form of Abosom) is derived from the Twi word Som-bo. This refers to something valuable or very precious, such as gold or diamond. Hence the name \"Valuable\" theory (Warren 1979:122). According to Okomfo Afua Nsiah the Abosom are as important as Onyame and that they possess powers applicable to all circumstances. Because they are so valuable each Akan village has its own Abosom. They can appear at anytime to meet the circumstances and needs of their people. She explains that Akan people have many Abosom since they have many needs. Okomfo Afua Nsiah concludes that it would be unrealistic and unwise to expect anyone to prosper or even survive without recognising the Abosomaduasa \"many Abosom.\" In the course of two years stay at Nsiakrom I had many conversations with some of patients in the cult. To them the Abosomare called Se-manhyia. Se-manhyia has no actual English equivalent, but it points to the idea of something of a great value to the Akan people, which they cannot live without it. Ifa certain Obosom should prove utterly ineffective it is abandoned and the people turn to other Obosom. If, on the other hand, it is powerful the people stick to it and render sincere homage to 14 it. In this sense Obosom is in no way eternally obligated to serve its people, and its existence 1s of a little interest to humanity unless it actively plays a beneficent role in their lives. The Akan practitioners withdraw their devotion to a deity when they discover the Obosom has lost its sustaining and protective powers. If it delivers the goods it is a precious thing which is accorded worship. If, on the other hand, it falls into disrepute through disuse and fails to provide the necessary services, the practitioners also refuse to regard it as valuable, or worthy of attention (Busia 1954: 95). Thus the number of Abosom is constantly being added to, while at the same time, some pass into oblivion after enjoying countrywide fame for a season. I want to stress here that this study will interpret the Abosom activities from the standpoint of the indigenes and not merely that of the outside observers. The Valuable theory, in my view, makes an important distinction between a \"thing\" and \"value\". A \"valuable object\", according to the indigenes, is said to differ from a thing in that it possess a \"content\" and a \"meaning\" given to it by the Akan people who use it in their daily life. The Abosom are valuable to indigenes and cannot be compared to any ordinary thing. In this section, I have introduced the Abosom theories to indicate the uncertainty that has surrounded the meaning of the concept of Obosom. I have pointed out approaches that were misdirected, and have suggested an approach from the indigenous perspectives. This study will drop the word fetish/animist and use the practitioners' word Abosom because | am of the opinion that the former labels are inadequate and do not communicate the significance of the Akan religion. 15 1-3 Importance of the Study There is a sign of revolt against what the African people have come to regard as foreign religion and culture. A voice (in the wilderness) is being raised as a signal for a return to the old ways and wisdom of the fathers. The Abosom is one of the old ways to which many Africans are looking. This study is a contribution to the on-going debate about going and looking for something we have lost, something that has gone with the past but is still valuable. Using Obosom Tigare of Nsiakrom as a case study, this work shows the dominant attitude that the foreign cultures have on the Akan people, their religion, and way of life I see this study not just as a reflection on the past experiences of Akan colonisation, but rather as the extension of those experiences to the present day-to-day life of the people. Thus, I see this work as contributing to the analysis and understanding of the devastating conditions which exist in modern Ghana and other developing societies and the people's response to these conditions. After so many years of independence African countries are still experiencing colonialism, but this time it is black against black. This phenomenon is clearly seen in what Christianity is doing to the indigenous religion. There is rejection and neglecting of all the things \"indigenous\" and over-dependence on the things Western. Equally important, this work allows space for the practitioners of Akan religion to express their concern and dissatisfaction with the impact of foreign political, religious, medical, and economic policies on their indigenous institutions. It also allows indigenous people space to affirm the best of their own culture. The affirmation is that the Akan Abosom have contributed and continue to contribute towards the progress and development of Ghana in particular, and 16 Africa in general. Unfortunately there is no literature which has emphasized this positive contribution or has even acknowledged it. This study does not intend to romanticise the Akan religion but, like any other world religions, there are positive and negative aspects. This study believes the latter can be eliminated and the former be improved, maintained and utilised. For most of the studies carried out on indigenous African traditions the indigenous voice seems to be passive. Rarely do indigenous people describe or offer their own interpretations of events and ideas. Instead the ethnologists look over their shoulders and read their cultural meanings and texts into them. In my case, a trained cultural anthropologist from the indigenous' background has set out to study his own people. This study should be \"a yard stick\" in comparison to the previous works which have studied Akan culture from the outside. But it is also an acknowledgement that it is a Western education that has prepared and assisted an African to write about his own people and culture. On the other hand, this means that African cultural studies are no longer dependent on Western anthropologists to gather ethnographic data. In anthropology today, indigenous peoples are beginning to represent themselves and their societies to the world. This study represents a sum of voices from within the indigenous population, rather than simply being a dialogue between the ethnographer and one of his or her informants. In my study it is the indigenes themselves who speak and talk about their Abosom. They will correct a long lasting impression that the indigenous religion is for the \"old people\" and the \"uncivilised\" and must give way to Christianity and Islam. However, this study has some limitations. I have used western concepts and categories to represent the indigenous beliefs and practices which may not convey exact meanings. Secondly, 17 in some places I could not get the exact Twi equivalent in English. For example, I could not find a Twi word for \"religion\". Thirdly, these western concepts and categories were developed in the comparative method but I have them in a different context. The question is, how can I for my purpose today, use terms developed for such different purposes? And if I strip myself of these categories used in the comparative method, what am I going to put in their place, not only as labels for pigeon-holes, but also as expressions indicating the directions of my interest? This kind of difficulty appears again and again in this study. 1-4 Method of the Study During the fieldwork I patiently traced the practitioners' life histories by visiting their homes to hear all that their close relatives had to say about them. I contacted people who were once members of the Abosom cult, and for one reason or another had left, to ask about their experiences. I went to the regional and district archives and read many literatures on Akan religion in general. Also, I searched through police stations and read diaries and District court cases about allegations made against the cult. I also interviewed Christians who were not interested in the cult in order to obtain a balanced view. I also tape-recorded ritual sessions and took field notes and questioned others, but also relied on my own personal experiences through participation and observation. To gain a full knowledge of the meaning of rituals I tried to record everything on tape and then follow-up with a translation of the material to understand its organisation and the intentions of the members who performed them. At the end of the day I played back the tape-recorder for my informants to hear, and made necessary corrections. Then I discussed their interpretations. 18 The interview sessions were all tape-recorded in oral form. They all took place in my own language and so there was no interpreter. As feedback, sometimes I encouraged people to ask me questions about my project. These interview sessions proved useful and established a better understanding between us. There were some issues that I considered important but were often of less interest to the members. [ encouraged them to share what they thought was important with me, and these sometimes became topics for discussion (Bittner 1963: 937). In this research I adopted the indigenous methods of learning by \"auditory\", \"visual\", and \"kinesthetic means. The auditory method of learning, according to Akan tradition, is \"by listening to the elders\". To the Akan, listening to the elders is more than what Slavens calls \"memorising steps by steps in sequence\" (Slaven 1990: 25). The indigenous method 1s a reciprocal one in which the learner becomes part of the subject. One of my informants put it this way: \"When an outsider is allowed to listen to Okomfo Afua Nsiah, it does not only imply learning, but to a certain degree he/she becomes part of the religion\". The visual method is learning by \"seeing\". My chief informant, Okyeame Badu kept on telling me that \"there are many things, which I may forget to explain to you, but you can know the meaning at least, by seeing it\". I found that this visual learning enabled me as Hexam puts it, \"To look at religion in the raw\", that is, \"to look at what people do as well as what people say, and thus come to terms with religion as it is lived\" (Hexham 1990: 12). Last but not least, is kinesthetic learning, that is, learning by doing. This type of learning applies mainly to areas such as \"drumming\" and \"dancing\". I took a great deal of time learning how to drum and the meanings attached to it. As Nketia puts it: 19 To a European whose ear and mind are untrained for this faculty, the rhythm expresses nothing beyond a repetition of the same note at different intervals of time; but to a native it expressed much more. To him the drum can and does speak, the sounds produced from it forming words, and the whole measure or rhythm a sentence (Nketia 1982: 49). When Okomfo Afua Nsia is dancing to a drum and does not follow or discern the meaning, she quickly stops the drummer with the following phrase: Menhu nea etire kosie, literaly \"I cannot make the tail\". Or she might say: Mente asee, \"I do not understand\". The music also plays an important role in spirit possession. It is believed that it is the songs that call the spirit to descend upon the priestess. As part of my study I learned some of the songs and their meanings. In the early stage of my research I devoted about one month to study conversational ethics, that is, the etiquette of \"who talks to who', \"who listens to who\", and \"when they talk and when they remain silent''. In the Akan tradition there are conversational taboos which must be observed lest offence be given. For example, in conversation, men must not speak openly to women on sexual matters. I learned to avoid the Akan tendency to answer a question in terms of pleasing the interlocutor, or the tendency to hedge or hide the truth. Here, informants often distort certain parts of their tradition in order to glorify it and to cover the more inglorious aspects of the past. | also interviewed members of the cult about their ailments and problems, which gave me the opportunity to share and empathize with their traumatic experiences. 20 1-5 The Research Site I chose as my field site Obosom Tigare in Nsiakrom, Ghana (map # 1) because I have lived in the area and am quite familiar with the life and thought of the people. As someone who is familiar with the customs and traditions, I was able to call attention to certain issues which otherwise might be overlooked or glossed by my informants. The second reason I chose Nsiakrom shrine is that my age did not disqualify me from access. Here adults have free access to the shrine room. Thirdly, Nsiakrom is an Akan speaking area and as an Akan I had some linguistic advantages. My familiarity with the language in both its profane and sacred usages inspired confidence in the people and made it easier to collect relevant materials. As an Akan I did not need an interpreter in the interviews nor permission to participate in the religious activities, and thus avoided problems of mediated interpretations. However, this does not imply that \"outsiders\" cannot research Akan religion. Being an \"insider\" sometimes prevented me from adopting a more \"objective\" perspective on the situation as a whole. Fourthly, the Obosom Tigare is believed to be the most powerful cult in the country and hence it has attracted and continues to attract clients from all the regions of Ghana as well as from other West African countries. The range of people available gave me a broad perspective on West African religion and also an opportunity to interact with clients from other countries. In addition, among the many priestesses in Ghana, Okomfo Afua Nsia of Obosom Tigare is one of the few who is prepared to discuss her religious skills and secrets with researchers. The shrine also has written records and an interpreter who transcribes Okomfo Afua Nsia's language into 21 conversational Twi when she is possessed. It also has records of important issues and has a secretary who keeps records of all her patients and their background information which can be used in statistical analysis. Finally, though Ghana's culture and social organisation have been subjected to outside influences, yet more than any village in the country Nsiakrom has proved itself resistant to encroachment of foreign cultures. It has become the centre of the original Akan culture and as such it has attracted the attention of other scholars such as Appia-Kubi (1981) and Twumasi (1975) who have compiled extensive notes on the religion. In sum, Nsiakrom village has provided me with the opportunity to look at religion in the raw, that is, to look at what people do as well as what people say, and thus come to terms with religion as it is lived. 1-6 Thesis Outline This first chapter is an introduction which deals with the problem of the phenomena called Abosom and discusses various theories thereof as well as my approach and methodology. My methodology takes the indigenous approach of acquiring knowledge through visual, auditory, and kinesthetic means. That is learning by seeing, hearing and participating. The second chapter basically focuses on the Akan worldview, including an account of the various Akan Abosom. This is important to the study, because it is a way of moving from the \"general\" to the \"particular\" and introduces a note of caution in generalising about the beliefs and practices of the Akan. It shows that within their own tradition, there are many differences of opinion and interpretation. This chapter also describes a particular area of Akan territory, 22 Nsiakrom and its economic, social and political organisations. This chapter shows that in spite of the strong influences of the outside world, there are still people interested in traditional Akan culture and practice its values. The third chapter delves into the Nsiakrom universe, the larger world in which the Obosom Tigare finds itself, to deal with Akan metaphysics. To the people, land is not just ordinary land to be exploited, but a being that can interact with human beings. In short, the land in which the Obosom Tigare cult is planted was already a fertile plane. In a sense the cult grew of its own accord. The fourth chapter focuses on the scope of Akan worship. In Akan religion many spiritual agents are mentioned but when one talks of worship, most of these agents are not worshipped because they have neither priests nor shrines. Real worship is where there are priests/priestesses, temples, and shrines. Chapter five discusses the origin of the Obosom Tigare and shows how it has incorporated Islamic, Christian, and indigenous elements into its worship. The structure of the shrine, the training of its priestess, the enrolments of membership are discussed in detailed. This chapter shows how the cult has blended the old and the new in order to survive, in contrast to other Abosom, which did not adapt to the changes of time and have died out completely. Chapters seven and eight document the role religion plays in the life of the people including the role of Obosom Tigare in preventing and controlling diseases. The cult claims to prevent transmission of sexual disease, teenage pregnancy, diseases in general, incest, theft of farm produce and litigation. Thus the cult is an effective method of the indigenous social control. The 23 cult deals with special ailments which medical doctors have failed to treat. These include infertility, impotence and blindness. Other ailments treated are believed to have been brought about by curses, breaking of taboos, witchcraft and charms. Students who want to pass exams and all those who have immigration problems also appeal to the cult for help. Chapter nine concludes the thesis that so long as Obosom Tigare continues to meet human needs it will not die away with the passing of time. 1-7 Problems Encountered in the fieldwork The fieldwork researcher who has to meet and interview many unfamiliar people is bound to meet some problems no matter how careful he/she might be. In the fieldwork I experienced some problems and would like to put them down as a guide for future researchers in the area. My first problem concerned mobility. The road from Kumasi to the village (about one hundred kilometres) is in three sectors, and is indication of the state of Ghanaian roads (map # 2). The first sector is about sixty kilometres from Kumasi, the regional capital, to Konongo the district head and is tarred. The second sector is about twenty-six kilometres and is from Konongo to Praso. This part of the road is not tarred but it is easy to drive on it. The third sector 1s from Praso to Nsiakrom and is believed to be the road the priestess Afua Nsiah constructed in the mid- sixties. Unlike the other two, there is no part of this road that is not covered with flood. As well, there are number of wooden bridges which are in a decrepit state. This made travel extremely time consuming and even dangerous and hindered my ability to visit various sites in my fieldwork. 24 The second problem has to do with \"privileged information\". Although Okomfo Afua Nsia did not insist on copyright for information she gave, she wants it to be \"protected\". She calls this information a \"secret of her profession\". A friend who was known to the priestess first introduced me to her and informed her that I wished to talk to her. When she found out that I had come, not in search of her services, but to probe into the nature of her profession she informed me that that day was sacred and she would not speak to me. I should go and come back the following week. When I came back as she had instructed, I was told by one of her daughters that she had been suddenly taken ill and so she would not be able to see me. The message was clear, and so I left without a word. It was only on my third visit that she agreed to discuss my project for she saw that I meant business. She said I could stay in the village and carry on my project but asked for fee -money, one bottle of schnapps, and a live ram. This seemed very strange to me as an Akan, for in the old Akan tradition, priests/priestesses should not demand any fee for whatever services rendered. It seems that in modern times, economic hardship has affected Akan traditional values. Or perhaps she was copying physicians and other public health professionals who charge fees for their services (Airhihenbuwa 1995: 59). Another difficulty was the interview sessions. They were sometimes difficult even when the priestess was congenial and open. There were often interminable digressions to simple answers and to direct questions. At times I had to frame the sentence or the question in several forms until I got a response which was consistent and reliable. I recall many instances when she refused absolutely to speak on some particular theme, insisting that the information be reserved 25 only for those who were initiated and ordained into the priesthood. As a whole, I enjoyed my stay. The traditional hospitality that was accorded to me in most places helped to sustain my interest. In certain cases, when the priestess was possessed, | was drawn into the process as the spirit promptly greeted me and enquired about my mission and wished me well. In many ways these were the most informative experiences of my fieldwork. 1-8 My Own Initiation into Obosom Tigare I entered the fieldwork with the notion that I had not only come to do research but also to learn the art of Obosom Tigare priestcraft and so I asked to be initiated. To be initiated into Obosom Tigare's cult is a way of interacting personally with Obosom Tigare. It is more than merely coming to the shrine with a specific problem for solution, or more than voluntarily joining the cult for spiritual protection. The main purpose of this initiation rite for me is to foster an intimate relationship with the Obosom Tigare - to be able to talk him and for him also to talk to me. This is the kind of initiation rites I requested Okomfo Afua Nsiah to help me to achieve. Such initiation rites occur only during the celebration of Akwasidae or Awukuadae. The Akwasiadae and Awukuadae are derived from the word Adae. Literally, the Twi word Adae means a \"resting place\" or \"sleeping place\", but when it is connected to specific days of the week they are known as Akwasidae (Sunday) and Awukuadae (Wednesday); they are observed as a special days of worship. There are therefore nine Akwasidae and nine Awukuade celebrations in the Akan annual calendar. (This will be treated more fully in the next chapter). Before I could be initiated I had to be formally introduced to Okomfo Afua Nsiah and the 26 Obosom Tigare. It was perfectly normal for me to see Okomfo Afua Nsiah and talk to her. However, there was a certain Akan custom I had to follow. To enter the shrine for the first time, I must not go to the house with empty hands. I bought one bottle of Aromatic schnapps from Kumasi and kept it in my handbag. As soon as I entered the house Okomfo Afua Nsiah gave me a bottle of Aromatic schnapps, traditionally called Akwanso-nsa (welcoming drink), and the interpretation was, \"I had come home and therefore, I should be at ease\". The background to this ritual was that in the Akan's past, when slaves were pursued, those who were able to run into people's homes before they were captured were set free. And so it had become a tradition to offer every guest \"water\" to drink on arrival. It was in the same spirit, I guessed, that Okmofo Afua Nsiah welcomed me to her house with schnapps. It was in the same manner, that the guest presented to his/her host a drink before he/she spoke or stated his/her mission. Following the Akan tradition, before saying a word, I opened my briefcase and presented to Okomfo Afua Nsiah a bottle of Dutch Aromatic schnapps. It is important to note that there is a difference between the two presentations. In the former case it is called Akwanso-nsa (welcoming drink) and in the latter it is called Bomu-nsa \"knocking drink\". That is, it is by presenting this drink that I am requesting permission to address or speak to the Obosom Tigare and her priestess (plate #3). To the native, this ritual is more than what Marshall Sahlins calls \"balanced reciprocity\" (Sahlins 1972: 46). It is Amanee a \"custom\" which obliges the host and the guest independently. I stated my mission and then the chief linguist paraphrased it in the following form: Enye bone, 27 (The mission is not bad) Owura Charles firi Canada aba, se worebesua wo ho nsem (Mr. Charles has come from Canada to this village to learn about you). After stating my mission, Okomfo Afua Nsiah received the drink and demanded Akoko (live fowl or bird). This was very important, for before Okomfo Afua Nsiah and her elders would allow me to stay in the village the consent of the Obosom T igare must be sought. This illustrates that the formal approval of any request made in the village does not rest with the community, but rather with cult. And the consent of the Obosom Tigare is sought through the fowl or bird. The method of seeking the consent is in the form of a ritual. The throat of the Akoko is slit, and is set free to move about in the compound. When it finally Dayaya \"dies on its back with the chest facing the sky\", the interpretation is Wadi which literally means \"the deity has accepted or approved the request\". If, on the other hand, Butu \"it dies on the breasts with the chest facing downward\", it means Wanni; that means, \"the deity has rejected it\". The result is then communicated to the client and the whole assembled crowd. With approval, the client's face shows contentment and relief. And the crowd gives him/her congratulations. When mine turned positive the crowd cheered and waved with admiration. Then libation was poured with words of blessing in this form: Mommoa no ma n'adwuma nko so, (Help him and prosper his project), Ope sika a, pa, 28 Come and stand behind him with goodness and blessing (plate # 4). After the formal introduction the initiation rite was scheduled to take place on Akwasidae celebration. On Sunday 10\" April 1998, about 8.a.m I put a small piece of cloth around my waist with bared chest and back fully decorated with cowries and beads. Also, my knees were tied with a number of coins on a thread. The opened spaces of my body were smeared with Ntwoma (red clay). My neck was piled with beads swinging from left to right. With these decorations I knelt down before Okmofo Afua Nsiah. Then Okomfo Afua Nsiah pulled Motto (black powder) from a goat-skin bag, added a little bit of liquor into it and poured the two into a sacred pot and started reciting incantations. After a while she also poured liquor into the sacred pot and asked me to drink. After the drinking, immediately I felt that my body was shaking and about to fall on the ground. Okomfo Afua Nsiah and her attendants held my hands fast and carried me to my room. I did not wake up until ten o'clock the next day. The importance of the initiation rite was far- reaching. First it gave me a new identity. The priestess gave me a new name, \"Kwakuw'', which was a significant indication that I had been initiated into Obosom Tigare cult and that \"I have become a new person\". My life in the village was distinguished from those of the other men for I had to conform to certain rules which included the following. I did not eat fish, mutton, or pork and I did not \"eat here and there\" in homes where utensils had been used for such food. I did not wear perfumes. Attached to this were also certain privileges. I occasionally received food, meat, and drinks without paying for them. Also, the initiation rite gave me a better opportunity to understand the in-depth knowledge 29 of the Akan religion. Immediately after my initiation ceremony, I went to Okomfo Afua Nsiah's house to greet her and to report that I had got up and I was feeling fine. After we exchanged the traditional greeting, she proceeded to ask whether I knew how to dream. I answered in the affirmative. Indeed, as a Christian minister some of my members had told me their dreams and personally I have had dreams from time but I did not take them seriously. However, I was surprised why she asked me that question and came to appreciate its significance. She pointed out to me that \"dreams\" were necessary condition for interaction with Obosom Tigare. Two weeks after the initiation I woke up one night with a startling and powerful image in mind. I had dreamt that Abuburo (dove) was knocking on my door and was sitting there in front of me, with its eyes and mouth wide open watching me. The following morning I went to Okomfo Afua Nsiah in a very depressed mood. The problem is the Abuboro Abuburo was it....? How did it feel...? And how do you feel now? Did it say anything to you? How do you feel now remember it? My response: I knew it was Abuburo; he sat there, looking at me. I do not know how it felt... it felt more like waiting I guess. It is a beautiful bird. I feel a bit sad, I guees. Or worried, like... Okomfo Afua Nsiah: Have you seen it before? Do you recognize it? Did it threaten you? Did it speak to you? 30 My response: No. [do not think I met it before, and it was not frightening, just. . just, I don't think it said anything. Maybe, but I don't know why it was waiting. Okommfo Nsiah: It is Obosom Tigare who turned to Abuburo. It came there to speak to you. You would be seeing him from time to time in different forms to chat with you. You should not be frightened when see them in future. Later Okomfo Afua Nsiah told me: \"You've got to be careful with these animals\". As long as long as you do not know, it does not matter. When you go into the woods do not kill them. Animals, birds, and many others, they hear you, they know your thoughts. You got to watch your words, think well of them\". This and all other dreams changed my perception about animals and spiritual beings. Now I noticed that the difference between human and non-human is not one of essence. We define them as animals because we are usually unable to see their cultured. In order to join them at this level, as cultured beings, we have to leave our own realm and become \"wild\", i.e. non-human or become Okomfo. Henceforth I paid attention to my dreams and carefully listened to other people's dreams. Okomfo Afua Nsiah invited me to join her in the interpretation of dreams. I now understood the Akan axiom: Ya som yen dae pa, which means, \"Let us dream good dreams\". That is, dream is one of the important elements in the Akan religion and people even \"pray\" for them. I reported my dreams to Okomfo and shared my views with her. To report my dreams and to engage with her in their interpretation was again to demonstrate that I was prepared to take accounts of dreams seriously and to act upon them as they deserved. The dream experience clearly 31 established in my mind that I could not only learn about the indigenous religion, but could also, to some degree, experience in dreams symbols that informed their sacred world view and engaged with them in their interpretation. The initiation rite and subsequent learning experience had a strong impact on my life and it continues to influence my life now as a Christian minister and as an indigenous anthropologist. Previously I used to condemn people wearing amulets around their necks, waists, wrists, on their back, or over one shoulder and under the opposite arm, and called them \"pagans\". I refused to baptise children wearing amulets around their waist. I remember I once took an amulet from a child, chopped it up \u2014 and the child died. From my Christian point of view, amulets were idols. But now, I take time to find the meaning of what people are doing or practising. For example, when I asked about a child who had an amulet on a string slung over one shoulder and under the opposite arm, the father explained: We lost one child and when this one got sick and trembled like the other one, we went to the diviner and learned that our first child died of Soro-yadee which is now threatening this one. This is Soro-yadee from both sides, but the one from the mother's side is strongest. We have not yet said goodbye to it with sheep and goat. I now realise that Soro-yadee, like other illnesses, can be dealt with in steps; there are temporary measures and final solutions; there are cheaper and more expensive treatments. Those who cannot afford to \"bid farewell\" to Soro-yadee can at least try to save the child by means of an amulet. Also, I have realised that the Abosom not only heal diseases but also teach as men do 32 through dreams, trances, and visions. The Abosom are the authorities and active agents in the indigenous religion. This was confirmed when I asked Okomfo Afua Saa, the chief priestess of Dechimso, whether her Obosom had taught and continued to teach her. She replied, \"The Obosom teaches me what to do everyday\". The most authentic knowledge as far as priestcraft is concerned, comes from the deity. From this initiation rite I obtained a clear picture of Obosom Tigare which I was about to understudy. The initiation rite showed me that Obosom Tigare is a \"being\" who can communicate with human beings. The Obosom Tigare understands, hears, talks and responds to human needs in diverse ways, like the Azande poisoning oracle. She is not a \"person\" in the ordinary sense of the word; for it has no hands, eyes, mouth and head, no feet and belly. But in another sense she may be classified as a \"person\" in the way in which she meets human requests. The way the practitioners come with all kinds of problems points to the fact that they conceive that she has Kra (a soul) and can communicate. This is part of the Akan world sacred view. 33 Chapter 2 The Akan Sacred Worldview 2-1 Concept of Ewiase (world) Scholars who have studied African peoples hold different opinions about African worldviews. Some of them are of the view that the African worldview is similar everywhere, hence, there is nothing like the \"Akan worldview\" or the \"Yoruba worldview\". They see worldview as primarily about the Supreme Being, divinities, ancestors, gods, witchcraft and magic, and all African ethnic groups as having these concepts in their religions. For instance, in Busia's (1963) triangular model of African worldview, he puts the Supreme Being at the top, ancestors and divinities at each angle, while witchcraft and magic are below them. In his view, this model applies to all religions in Africa. From such studies as have already been done on the religious beliefs and rites of different communities, it is possible to discern common religious ideas and assumptions about the universe held throughout Africa, and which provide a world view that many describe as African world view (Busia 1963: 149). Taylor also argues that there is in Africa, particularly south of the Sahara, a basic worldview that is fundamentally the same everywhere (Taylor 1963: 27). In Idowu's view there is a common worldview about African religious beliefs and practices. This common African worldview, according to Idowu, is either due to cultural diffusion or to common origins, which most Africans share with one another. In this African worldview, Idowu concludes, there is a common 34 thread running throughout them (Idowu, 1973:103). The general idea, according to these scholars and many others, is that Africans have a worldview which is similar everywhere. Other scholars hold the view that the peoples' worldviews generally differ from one group to another. Sapir, for instance, argues that a worldview is a set of cultural and psychological beliefs held by members of a particular society. He concludes that the worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same worlds with different labels, and the people have distinct cultural values and point of views (Sapir 1929: 210). In Gyekye's opinion, Africans' institutions and practices are not mere concepts, but are a way of life that is different from one group to another. He adds that they are the embodiment of, and the basis for their culture. He explains that the Akan worldview, for example, has spiritual beings that have personal names and are assigned specific duties and roles in the community. The names of the spiritual beings, their duties and roles, are expressed in idioms, axioms, and proverbs which are not directly expressed in other African societies, but are only found in Akan societies (Gyekye 1995: 191). My own fieldwork conforms to the theory that there is \"universal African worldview\". The Nsiakrom experience of a certain reality which coincides with realities experienced in other African cultures (map # 3). My first encounter with this reality of Mmoatia (little folks) occurred on Wednesday July 29 1998, when I decided to visit the home of one of my informants in the nearby villages in Nsiakrom. On the way to the village I saw a girl about eight years old, running toward what I thought were four young men who were about 300 meters ahead. When I got close to her, I stopped and asked where she was going? She replied that she was going to accompany 35 the men to their village. I waited for about five minutes to be sure she had got close to them and after that I drove back to Nsiakrom. About two hours later, news broke out in the village that a girl was missing. I went to the girl's house and described the girl I saw on the road that evening. My description gave the family a clue that she might have been picked up by Mmoatia \u2014 apparently the four men I saw. The chief and his elders mounted a search and a week later she was found. She was brought to the chief's house where I interviewed her. During the interview, she told me that when I was chatting with her, the \"four men\" told her to leave me and let them go their way, even though I heard nothing. From this experience | realised that in the Akan sacred worldview the spirits are as real in everyday experience as we natural objects are. This Akan sacred worldview articulates a physical and spiritualised universe and does not distinguish one from the other. Also, the \"spiritual beings\" can change into \"physical beings\" in order to interact with human beings. This kind of relationship has its own concepts, symbols, and idioms that are specifically meaningful to a particular group as well as has its own \"triggering mechanisms\". Parrinder grasps this point when he states \"It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the religious foundation of the African people without going through the 'thought-area' occupied by their ancestors (Parrinder 1954: 57). In the Akan sacred worldview there are two categories of beings \u2014 \"beings with-Sasa\" and \"beings without-Sasa\". The Akan word \"Sasa\" is a special power found in objects of nature. The difference between the two is that the former beings are powerful and vengeful but the latter are non-vindictive beings. Also, the classification is not based on the physical presence they represent but rather on \"spiritual danger\" they pose. This is expressed in Osono 36 kokuroo nanso Adowa ne payin, which is literally translated as \"an elephant is a huge and savage animal but (small antelope) Adowa is the senior. In other words, the latter is more powerful than the former and if a hunter inadvertently kills any Sasa-being, he must undergo a spiritual purification. The Akan put it in this way: Ese se odware sasaduro \"he/she must have a spiritual bath to avert that vengeful spirit\". Appiah-Kubi sums it up in the following words: \"For the Akan, health is symptomatic of correct relationship between one and one's environment: the supernatural environment, the world around one and one's fellow men women\" (Appiah-Kubi 1983: 263). It is believed that there is a kind of interaction between beings with-Sasa and beings without-Sasa. The beings with-Sasa can subvert the beings without-Sasa but the beings without- Sasa cannot subvert the beings with-Sasa. Again, the Akan reverential attitude towards natural objects, such as trees and rivers, is in fact directed to the Sasa that is believed to inhabit them, not to the tree per se. In other words, trees or plants are sacred, essentially, for the sacred reality they represent. As Eliade explains: ... No tree or plant is ever sacred simply as a tree or plant: they become so because they share in a transcendental reality, they become because they signify that transcendent reality. By being consecrated, the individual 'profane' plant species is transubstantiated... (Eliade 1986: 268). Idowu's observation is that \"such a tree as spirits inhabit becomes their emblem, at the foot of it offerings are made to them and people make ejaculatory prayers as they pass by\" (Idowu 1973: 177). Because the spirits inhabit in animals and plants, the Akan believe they are capable of 37 communicating with other animate objects as well as human beings. Though animals and plants are available for human beings to use, the latter have to show respect for their spirits through gift or ceremony. For example, it is necessary to place an egg under a medicinal plant before removing some of its roots if it is expected to have power to cure. The Akan sacred worldview has a host of beings with Sasa, but this study will limit itself to only six of them, and they are Onyame (Creator), are the \"big six\", which the Akan believe must be in harmony. When this harmony is broken, an Akan's life is believed to be in danger. Life problems such as disease, famine, drought, and many other calamities will set in. One of my informants puts in this way: Se eba saa dea na yawu, which literally means, \"when this harmony is maintained things go well, but when it is broken there is chaos\". According to my informants these spirits are capable of promoting human welfare, advancing man's undertakings and reversing actions that will trouble them. Moreover, they are the beings which patronise farm work, protect habitations, give fertility to women, assist in war and superintend human activities on earth. As Skorupski puts it: \"One finds the reality of gods and spirits woven with many strands of belief into everyday experience\" (Skorupski 1976: 26). 2-2 Concept of Onyame (Creator) Ewiase (world), according to the Akan, did not come into existence of its own volition 38 but was created or brought into being by somebody known as Odomankoma-oboadee (Asare Poku 1982: 63). The term Odomokoma can literally be translated as \"Eternal being'. And the term Oboadee is derived from two Akan words: Bo means to \"create\"; Adee means \"a thing or someone\". The two words mean \"the eternal creator\" and refer to things which are of an eternal nature. It appears Odomankoma-obodee is an ancient Akan title that has been replaced with a modern title Onyame. Hence the use of the title Onyame in their day-to-day conversations. However, the title Odomankoma-oboadee has not been completely abandoned in their vocabulary. To the Akan, Ewiase has a beginning but they do not think that it will ever come to an end. This is because Ewiase is controlled and sustained by Odomankoma. Hence Ewiase is what the Akan term as Koroboto yebetoo, na yebedane agya ho ako, which is literally translated as \"this universe, we all came to meet it and we shall all go and leave it behind\" where it remains. As Oosthuizen says, \"there is here no emphasis on final fulfilment or the end of the world\" (Oosthuizen 1991: 42). The Odomankoma-oboadee has created a moral order. This moral order eliminates evil from human society by assigning \"names\" to each creature as well as prohibitions, taboos, customs, regulations and laws, notions of right and wrong, as well as what is beautiful and what is ugly. But it is human beings' responsibility to keep this moral order through the Abosom who punish human beings who break its laws. The etymology of the word Onyame is still not clear. According to Abraham, Onyame comes from two Akan words: Onya \"to get\" or be in \"fortunate possession of something\", and 39 Mee which means to \"be satisfied and want nothing\" (Abraham 1969: 54). Abraham's derivation is probably based on the frequency with which the Akan appeal to Onyame for all sorts of help. In Field's view, by contrast, Onyame is derived from Nyame, which literally means, \"rain\" and indeed the Akan have expressions such as \"Onyame oreba (Onyame is coming) which 1s often uttered when rain is falling. When a stranger's arrival coincides with a needed shower of rain in Akan society, he/she is called Onyame-ba \"a child of Onyame''. And when the rain falls on the day of a person's death or immediately after the burial it is said that Onyame has blessed the departed. From these expressions Field concludes that \"Onyame is a \"rain god\" (Field 1970:158). However, the Akan do not identify Odomankoma-Obodee with other objects, such as rain, or Onya, as Okomfo Afua Nsiah puts it: identify 'Creator' with his 'creatures'. This would be what Gyekye calls \"pantheism\". A more appropriate description of associating the Creator with his creatures might be \"panpsychism\". The Akan do recognise that nature contains a bit of the Sasa of the Creator (Gyekye 1995: 75). Hence the Akan saying: Nnipa nyinaa ye Onyame mma, which is literally translated as \"AIl men are children of Onyame''. In this sense Onyame is Nana (the Great Grandfather) that is how he is addressed in most Akan libations. I quote here from a healing ceremony I witnessed during my field studies (December 1998) at Petransa, the hometown of Okomfo Afua Nsia. Otwereduapong, nana yi yare, na waba Obosom Tigare ho, Your grandson (patient) is ill and has come to Obosom Tigare, Obosom Obosom Tigare says he has a short life and has divined for him, Wakyere no kwan a wonfa so mpa ne ho sasa, That is, the Obosom Tigare has shown him what to do to ward off the mischief, Ode ne n'aboadee nyinaa aba, He (patient) has fetched the articles he showed him, Ode nyinaa aba w'anim, Daasebre, He gives them to you, Onyame, on whom men lean and do not fall, To ne nna mu, Lengthen his life for him, Wo nsa yie, gye na nom, This is the final wine; receive and drink, Nana, na ma no nkwa tenten Nana, that you may grant him long life. Nana, in the Akan family system, stands as \"a grandparent\" which is neither male nor female. He/she is the source of loving-kindness and protection. In other words, Nana could be \"a father\" or \"a mother\" because the sentiment expresses the Akan experience of closeness to Onyame. The Akan idea of closeness to Onyame is not only theoretical, but is practical and can be verified from the names Akan bear. Names such as Nyame-kye (gift of Onyame), Nyame-ama (Onyame- 4] has-given), are examples how is to the Akan. The Akan consider Nana as a perfect being and full of wisdom. In Akan mythology and folktale, Nana is the ubiquitous hero, noted for his skill and ingenuity for bringing knowledge and science to man. When the Akan thus consider Onyame as Nana or Kokuroko, they are conferring upon him the highest wisdom. In Akan thinking, humans do not come anywhere near to the wisdom of Onyame. He makes no mistakes and it is He who gives part of his wisdom to human beings and the Abosom. To the Akan, the Onyame is not only the Nana, but He is also Abommubuwafre. To the Akan, Abommubuwafre is one who is called upon when the situation is tense to rescue human beings by averting calamities. The term is also expressed as Se Onyame nni ho a anka me wui whichis literally translated as \"if Onyame had not been there, I would have perished\". His care and protection is also seen as the provider of rain, healing, and rescuing the oppressed. In the Akan worldview, Onyame is Daasebre. Daasebre is an Akan traditional title which is literally translated as \"He who is beyond thanks, and it refers to someone who is so beneficent and liberal that he makes mankind grow weary of returning thanks\". It is a term applied to ancient kings who were extremely benevolent to their subjects. To call Onyame, Daasebre in Akan thinking means that he will definitely help with a problem. Daasebre never leaves his people alone in danger but he is always with them. They put it this way: Onyame di w'akyi, \"Onyame is behind you\" which is voiced out when one escapes from danger. Onyame in the Akan sacred worldview is also Atoapem, which is literally translated as \"All things end up in him'. Their understanding is that everything in the universe is, as it is, 42 because of Atoapem. That is, it is Onyvame nhyehyee, \"Onyame made or willed it to be so\". The rich and the poor stand equal before him and no one has a right to complain, for he provides hope for the hopeless. According to these axioms it is believed that Onyame na owo obasin fufuo ma no (it is Onyame who pounds fufu for the one-armed person). And, if Onyame even takes care of the tailess-animal by driving away the flies, he will surely care for human beings, which are more valuable than an animal. The Akan hold the view that Onyame is the final arbiter of all matters. Natural disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes and epidemics are in the hands of Onyame alone. Almost all ill happenings are attributed to Onyame asem (Onyame's matter) and he is looked upon to provide relief. For example, people who are advised to take consolation in Onyame: Fa ma Onyame, or \"place the matter before Onyame\"'. Onyame not only provides answers but also pronounces blessings on everything an Akan does. Before clearing new fields for farming or settlement, Onyame is called upon to bless the project. Again it is customary for the Akan to include the name of Onyame in their greetings and farewells. These are couched in the form of short prayers. The person of whom leave is being taken says, Wo ne Onyame nko (may Onyame be with you), and the one who is departing says Me de Onyame gya wo (I leave Onyame with you). Both parties are saying that Onyame is their protector and they can only leave each other in his safe hands (Asare Poku 1972: 12). Onyame's name is used in congratulatory utterances. When a child is born, people go to the mother to wish her safe delivery and say Ye da Onyame ase oo! \"We thank Onyame\"'. At the coronation of a King or Chief, the Akan invoke the name of Onyame to bless and grant him long life and prosperity. In every speech and talk, the name of this Being is mentioned. 43 In business transactions the Akan leaves everything in Onyame 's hands when he/she says with hope, Se Onyame ma adepa kye me a, \"if Onyame gives me a good day\". When in difficulty, or extreme trouble, the Akan utter appeals such as Onyame boa me \"Onyame help me\". Onyame is considered to be the final explanation of all things, the point beyond which further questioning is meaningless. If one does not know what is wrong, if nobody understands a situation, and if a problem is insoluble, the Akan will find consolation in saying Onyame dee onim biribiara \"Onyame understands everything\". Oftentimes, when a person has escaped from danger or injury, or survives a serious illness he says: Se Onyvame ampata a, \"if Onyame had not intervened on my behalf.\" This means that it is Onyvame who has kept and 1s still keeping him/her alive. The Akan often pronounce oaths and curses in the name of Onyame, and when asked to witness an oath or execute a curse. In oath taking, the Akan call upon the name of Onyame to affirm or vouch the truthfulness or gravity of the statement being made. The expression Me do Onyame, 1s translated as \"I swear by Onyame'\"'. In mpae agradaa nsi m'apampamu (May Onyame's thunder strike me). At other times the formula take different expression Onyame ntua wo ka or Me de wo ma Onyame whichis translated as \"I hand you over to Onyame'\"'. In Akan arts and crafts the concept of Onyame feature prominently. The well-known artistic symbol Gye Onyame (Except Onyame) expresses the idea of the omnipotent, eternal, unique supremacy of Onyame (plate # 1). The meaning of the symbol, according to Antubam, is that \"No one has lived who saw Onyame beginning, and no one would ever live to see his end. The symbol is simply that only Onyame is omnipotent, supreme and eternal\" (Antubam 1963: 159). The Akan concept of Ntaakyire (circle) symbolises the presence and 44 power of Onyame. Hence when an Akan king sits on Onyame Nkatakyire, it symbolises Onyme's continual protection. There are other Akan art symbols or Adinkra symbols which are of immense religious significance. One such symbols is the \"leg of a fowl\". This is a symbol of a parent or guardian who is strict in dealing with his/her children without being brutal to them. It represents the Akan proverb Akoko nan tia ne ba na enku no (A hen treads upon her chicks but does not kill them). The Akan concept of Onyame-dua expresses family closeness. Onyame-dua is a sacred tree with three branches. Between the branches is a pot placed in the centre of it. Besides this pot there is a neolithic or meteorite stone which is called Nyame-akuma or \"Onyame axe\". Once in every month each member of the family washes his/her face with the water contained in the pot. The significance of this ritual is to cool and strengthened the hearts of all the family members. Another important symbol of Onyame is the decorations worn by Onyame-komfo (Onyame's priests) who are dedicated to the service of Onyame. The Okomfo's hair is arranged in a special way with bold patches left in the centre of the forehead. In these patches 1s painted white clay in three lines across the shoulder, arm, and the chest. Although these special priests are dedicated to Onyame, the Akan believe that everyone has direct access to him. The Akan say Wope asem aka akyere or speak to Onyame is to speak to the wind\" meaning that everyone can place his/her offering in the Onyame-dua receptacle (Ratttray 1927: 28). 45 2-3 Concept of Asase Yaa (Mother earth) The English word for \"Earth'', which is literally translated in the Akan language as Asase, can stand for \"dirt\", \"clay\", or \"dust\". In their day-to-day usage the Akan people use these expressions 1n reference to what they regard as Efi \"dirty things\" which have to be washed away, or \"taboos\" which have to be purged. But Asase, \"earth\", like the Igbo Ani, is a goddess, the most loved deity and the one who is closest to the people. She helps them if they are troubled, but punishes hardened criminals (Omoyajowo 1991: 75). The Akan believe that the Asase 1s much more than what we perceive it. According to one informant Opayin Yaw Wusu: Besides Onyame nothing else is as important as Asase; it is on Asase we walk and sleep. Also, it is Asase who provides food for us, for the animals and plants. The rivers, hills, and all the living creatures live on Asase. What could we do without Asase? If Onyame wants to give you blessing, he has to pass through Asase. Another informant says: There is no way you can escape Asase. The fact is that, if you die and have to go to Onyame, it is Asase who has to accept you first. Our ancestors lived on it before us. Now they are under it \u2014 at its bottom. They are all within Asase though they are now on other side of it. Seen as the mediator of all blessings as well as the living and the dead, Asase is believed to be a living, personalised being, capable of feeling, who can enter into interpersonal relationships with humans and supra-humans alike. She is called Asase Yaa among the Ashanti and personalised as a mother upon whom 46 people depend for their sustenance. It is she who provides food and shelter, and when death comes she makes available a resting home for people. Thus, for all practical purposes, people depend on her providence and sustenance for their living. Her important role in the Akan community is such that in all prayers she is mentioned. According to Antoahemaa (interview with Queen of Antoa, November 6'\" 2000), before a land is cultivated for farming Oto (mashed yam) is tied together with a gold nugget in a handkerchief and then prayers are offered to Asase Yaa to come and make the crops cultivated be prosperous. In most libations I observed, Asase Yaa is first mentioned as Amponyiamoa; that is, \"she who does not reject, scorn, or refuses a help to all who seek her\". This is evident in the Akan's attitude to corpses. According to the Akan, the only spiritual being who accepts corpses is Asase Yaa. The Akan say, Asase nkyiri funu, \"the not hate a corpse\". In case of stillbirths, autopsies must be carried out and the foetus removed from the womb of the dead mothers before Asase Yaa will accept. Asase Yaa is not only tolerant of dead bodies, but also of \"dancing\" and \"sickness\". Although people who do not know how to dance make rough steps on her, she does not complain. The Akan say Asa bone nkum asase, which literally translates as \"Asase is not killed by bad dancing\". In African healing, it is believed that Asase Yaa's power can neutralise the effects of disease. Thus, when Akomfo apply medicine to the sick they touch the ground as they recite the word: Asase gye yaree, which literally means \"Earth receive sickness\". It implies that the physician is transferring the sickness to Asase Yaa. Another important role of Asase Yaa in Akan religion is Asaseboa de nsie Yaa as \"a woman's womb\", in which all humans originate and where every creature will eventually rest eternally. To the Akan, Asase belongs to the ancestors, the living, and the yet-to-be-born. In some Akan societies her sacred day is \"Thursday\" in others it is \"Friday\". On each of these days no one is permitted to work on the land. A violation of this injunction is believed to have fatal consequences. The individual may become lost in the woods or be picked up by dwarfs who inhabit the groves. Hence, those who cultivate on her sacred days are punished. If a girl's first menstruation takes place the same day of Asase Yaa's sacred day, it is a taboo to the Akan. When the first menstruation coincides in this way it is believed that Asase Yaa is polluted and thus needs a sacrifice to \"cool her anger\" with the following words: Asase Yaa, asu bo o! Mma saa asem yi bi mma bio!, which is literally translates as \"Asase Yaa, here is a sacrifice, do not permit such a case ever to happen!\" It is Asase Yaa's Akyiwadie (taboo) for any one to have sex in the bush, even with one's own spouse. The Akan believe that sexual intercourse must be performed in decent places, especially in the homes. During my fieldwork, I observed that almost every Akan village has Asoneyeso (cultic place) which is dedicated to the worship of Asase Yaa. And there is always a special person concerned with the prayer who is dedicated to the worship of Asase Yaa, and this person holds high title in the Akan community. However, he is not regarded as a priest or a priestess. The importance of Asase Yaa to the community is summarised and condolences, Mate asa me dane wo, Earth and dust, I lean upon you. Se mewu a medane wo, Earth, when I die, I lean upon you. Asase a ogye afunu Earth that receives dead bodies, Okyerema se: The Creator's drummer says, Ma wo ho so! Arise! Ma wo ho so! Arise! Arise! The Akan, then, believe that Asase Yaa is the Mother upon whom all people depend. She is propitiated as a spirit, but not regarded as Obosom (divinity). The Akan say: Asase nye Obosom, onkyere is literally as \"Asase is not Obosom, she does not divine\". The Akan do not consult her for divination as they do Abosom. For the belief is that Asase Yaa is not an oracular deity. Offerings and sacrifices are made to her to help crops grow and to ward off misfortunes that may befall farmers. Consequently, temples or shrines are not dedicated to her. 49 There are no priests or priestesses, which serve her for she is accessible to all (Asare Poku 1982: 64), 2-4 Concept of Nsamanfo (ancestors/ancestresses) The Akan concept of Nsamanfo (ancestors) is expressed most forcefully at funerals. During my fieldwork, I accompanied the Okomfo Afua Nsiah and her entourage to a funeral, near Nsiakrom. As we entered the deceased's house I saw mourners both young and old, sobbing and wailing as they approached the dead body of the old woman with the following dirges: Oh Maame! Wode yen gyaa hwan Maame! Wo mma bewe ananse, Oh mother! Your children will feed on the spider. Akura mpo nam so ma yen, The mouse is too big a game. Owuo atwedee baako mforo, The terror that spares no one who meets him. Bands of musicians arrived to sing laments during this period of public mourning, but the singing of dirges continued. When the coffin was brought in and the old woman's body was placed in it for burial, the mourning reached its emotional peak. There was much wailing and many dirges were intensively sung. The singing of dirges is central to Akan funeral customs, and all women are expected to participate. Dirges are not sung outside the contexts of a funeral or the days of 50 mourning which remember the dead members of various households. The text of the Akan dirge usually opens with the name of the deceased, who is an ancestor/ancestress of the mourners, and the deceased is then associated with his or her place of birth. The principal subject of the dirge is a message to the ancestors/ancestress. The deceased is named and is identified; the singer then extends a personal message to the deceased. The message has to do with his or her plight and that of the other relatives of the deceased. It portrays the feelings of the living by indicating that they will not fare well and that they will suffer privations without him/her. The deceased is thus represented as one who has made an important contribution to the life of the family. The dirge indicates that when someone dies, the spirit goes to inhabit Asamando, a special world of ghosts or spirits (Sarpong 1974: 39) where the deceased person must settle accounts with the ancestors. Those who have had bad records are refused admission; they become Saman-twentwen (hovering ghost), tall and white, hovering around the earth and frightening people. These Saman-twentwen, the Akan believe, will continue to hover until they are conceived and born again into this world. As Packard says: The spirits of ancestors who were not accorded proper burial rites were also said to dwell in the bush and to whistle through the mountains like the wind, causing harm to anyone they met. The spirits of ancestors who had been properly buried, on the other hand, lived with the homestead and could be called upon for assistance (Packard 1980: 245). In the Akan sacred worldview, the ancestors play a role as spiritual beings in the governance of 51 the world, and it is essential that the lineage of ancestors/ancestresses be remembered. The occasion of death is one in which remembrance and communication with ancestors 1s particularly appropriate and immanently possible, for upon death the dead connect the world of the living to the world of the ancestral spirits in the funeral rite of passage (Gill 1985: 58). Life in the Asamando (world of spirits) is very similar to life on this earth. The living and the dead eat and drink in the same way. The only difference is that the dead are fed by having a few drops of water or strong drink and morsels of food on the ground. This is done each day and on special occasions, such as Naming ceremony with the following words: Nananom nsamanfo nsa nie, enne na yeto din enti na yerefre mo se momera, Here is drink, our revered ancestors, we have invited you this morning to come and help us in outdooring your own grandchild. Se nea monim no, yentumi nnye amanee yi bere enti na yerefre mo anopa V1, As you know, we cannot undertake such important customary rite without your participation. Abusua payin befa wo nkondwa na tra ase You are therefore welcome to assume your role as Head of family to supervise this rite. Oh Busumburu! wo nkwa so, moma yen nkwa tenten, na yenyini nkye, Oh! Busumburu, on behalf of our ancestors, bless this family and grant us long life and prosperity. Yen akodaa yi a yerebeto ne din yi hye mo nsa 52 We commit this child, about to be named, to your care. Ne nkwa so, Abusua Nkwa so, yen nyinaa nkwa so. Give him long life and let him be a good man to the glory of his family. Long life for all the members of the family. The Akan believe that their ancestors hold the same position after death as in life, and part of the request is to ask the Abusua Panyin/Obaa Payin to take his/her role as the head of the family, in granting long life and prosperity. It is believed that the Nsamanfo hold the same position in their matrilineal lineage even after death. As elders and predecessors, on the principle of seniority, they are the heads of the lineages. In other words, membership and family obligations do not cease. The head of the family's protection and guidance does not change. The living, on the other hand, must continue to venerate the dead and invoke them through libation in all family matters. As people living in another dimension of the world, the Akan's view is that their Nsamanfo are close to Onyame and can therefore present their needs and requests to him. That is, they have their feet planted in both worlds, and are even believed to be \"bilingual\". In this situation they not only send messages to Onyame, but they are also the final arbiters of all family disputes. People bring disputes and other cases to them to settle. These cases are heard without fee and \"peace is set\" between adversaries so that everyone may stay in the family without strife or anger in his/her heart. It is believed that if kinsmen are not in harmony with one another when they give food to the dead they do not eat. One of my informants puts it in this way: Se mpapae wo yen mu a, yede aduane ma Nsamanfo wonni, \"Our ancestors will not eat the food if we are not of one mind when we give it. And if they do not eat it they will bring ill upon us\". 53 2-5 Concept of Bayie (witchcraft) The Akan word for witch and witchcraft is Bayifo, which they use in two senses. In the first usage, Bayifo is any person who behaves abnormally; that is, outside the expected patterns of behaviour. Among abnormal behaviour are: not being fond of greeting people; living alone in an isolated area; exacting too much for sales of anything; walking about in the night; crying at night (in the case of children). The rest are not showing adequate sorrow at the death of a relative or somebody from within the community; not taking proper care of one's parents (particularly aged parents), children, wife or wives; hard-heartedness. Thus anyone who sets him/herself apart from others is quite simply Bayifo \"not a person'. What is important here is that deviance is not seen as inherent in certain forms of behaviour; it is rather seen as conferred upon these forms by social definitions. Thus, when somebody confesses to being Bayifo or is identified as one, it 1s assumed he/she possesses these characteristics. In the second usage, Bayifo refers to a person with an extraordinary spiritual power which enables a person to perform deeds beyond the capabilities of his/her fellow human beings. A cocoa farmer whose farm produces more than expected may be referred to as Bayifo. Similarly, a student who scores 100% in all his/her exams may be called Bayifo. Or an old woman/man with extraordinary wisdom in the community may be called Bayifo. These examples refer to people assumed to have extraordinary wisdom. Since the Akan have their own way of assessing or evaluating an individual's success, any person who exceeds their estimation is labelled as such. The word Bayie is not equivalent to Bonsam (Satan) whose power is used exclusively for evil. Nor does Bayie refer to the notion of black magic (Murray Masters 1950: 216). Rattray (1927: 54 28), though, mistakenly makes this association and the translation entered the literature. The term Bonsam perhaps derives from what the Akan call Sasabonsam, a being that has red eyes and long legs so that when he sits on a branch of a tall tree his feet reach the ground. Sasabonsam is believed to wander about in forested hills and is seen only on sacred days (when no one is expected in the forest) by a few hunters with extraordinary powers. Rattray translates Sasabonsam as a \"West African \"devil\" (Rattray 1927: 28). It seems the early Christian missionaries accepted Rattray's translation and association, and Bayie became Bonsam \"someone who does the work of the devil'. But Bayie has nothing to do with the devil that features in the Judeo-Christian religion. To the Akan, Bayifo is rather a person who has extraordinary power. The term has a positive connotation. The negative aspect probably stems from the Akan axiom that: Obira ye bayifo, which means \"each person has an evil intent in him/her'. The Akan believe that every Bayifo has a physical substance functioning as another body that allows the soul to engage in errands. Almost all my informants agree that the Bayie's substance is usually in the form of Toma, \"Aggrey beads\" worn around the waist. If the Toma is tied around the waist and the person comes to a house where his/her victim is lying asleep, he/she turns round and presses the Joma against the outside wall of the hut. The Toma then makes a connection between the Bayifo and the person who is asleep. The Azande conceive of this substance as a \"round hairy ball with teeth\" which is passed on from parent to child, so that all the sons of a male witch and all daughters of a female witch become witches (Evans-Pritchard 1937). The Abibio (a tribe in Nigeria) believe that this 55 substance is inherited and that every witch must get the substance from an established witch, by \"swallowing the substance\" (Offiong 1985: 156). The Akan view is that the substance is inherited by receiving Toma voluntarily. On his or her deathbed the Bayifo designates the person whom he or she loves the most and she gives him or her the Toma (McLeod 1940: 112). The Akan believe that there are more female Abayifo than male. Though there is no statistical evidence to support this assertion, it seems there is some truth in it. My research indicates that there are strong links between witchcraft and feminine fertility. Apart from its transfer through Toma, which is like birthing, it is believe that Bayie is most often kept in a woman's belly or vagina or in her Etam \"the red pubic cover-cloth over the vagina\". There is no reference that Bayie is harbored in man's penis. According to my informants Bayie activities are conducted in secret and only the participants know their arts. If their secrets are shared or made known to the public, the guilty person is killed. Some of the Bayie's secrets include initiation or rituals, undertaken when an individual reaches specific points in his or her life cycle. It is believed that Abayifo's power is confined to one's own house. That is, if Bayifo wants to kill, she/he can kill only from within his/her family, not outside. The Akan stress this in their proverbs and axioms: Bayifo didi n'anomye, na ontumi amfa ntwa asuo, which is literally translated as \"However fierce a witch may be, he/she eats on his/her own side of the stream and cannot cross to the other side of the river\". Another Akan axiom is Aboa bi beka wo ana efiri wo ntoma mu, which 1s literally translated as \"It is the person from the same house who can render one wretched while he/she lives\". In other words, Abayifo operate within the family circle. This 56 is perhaps the point which Rattary referred to when he stated that \"Abayifo have limitations in their operations\" (Rattray 1927: 58). Abayifo social organisation is believed to be similar to the Akan political system with chiefs, linguists, messengers and so on. Groups of Abayifo meet together periodically to discuss issues of common concern. One of my informants told me that before they kill any person they hold a debate whether to kill or not to kill. They can meet any place or any time, but their preferred meeting-places are at the top of tall trees on the edges of villages and towns. According to my informants, the Akan fear Abayifo only because of their physical appearance. They walk with their heads upside down, fly, or are carried at great speed. They also turn into animals as well as other natural objects and it is difficult to track them down. Another reason why Akan are afraid of Abayifo is that they can meet in another place while their bodies are asleep on their beds. And they go about their daily activities in the night instead of the daytime. The worst fear of the Abiyifo' is their desire to drink human Mogya (blood). The Abayifo usually attack women whose Mogya links them to their children, and the bond that holds family life together. By sucking the Mogya the Abayifo cause a breakage in family bonds and weakens the individual. Parrinder says: \"They can suck the blood of their victims, thereby making the persons look dry or suffer from anaemia\" (Parrinder 1963: 135). The Akan believe that the effect on the victim whose blood is drained by spiritual means is that he/she becomes lean and gradually wears away until finally he/she dies. Evans-Pritchard describes a similar effect among the Azande: \"The effects of witchcraft lead to death by slow stages, for it is only when a witch has eaten all the soul of the vital organs that death ensues\" 57 (Evans-Pritchard 1937: 38). There is no physical feasting on human flesh or actual drinking of human blood, yet the victims feel they are being drained. The Akan concept of Bayie 1s used to explain misfortune in daily life. The Akan say Enye kwa, \"there is nothing by chance\". That is, when only one person out of a busload dies in an accident and a snake bites only one out of four that walk on its trail, there is a reason. The interpretation is that the person is a victim of Bayifo for having done something wrong. The Akan concept of Bayie does not only explain misfortune but also enforces moral judgement. As with the Azande, the judgement witchcraft' means Pritchard 1937: 45). To the Akan, if one wants to be free from Bayie, then he or she has to carry out his or her social and moral obligations by living a charitable life and being generous in dealing with his or her fellow human beings, particularly his or her household members. Thus the concept of Bayie exerts a powerful restraining influence on anti-social behaviour. Anti-social behaviour such as glumness, hard-heartedness, ill temperedness, and bad manneredness, invite the suspicion of being witched. As Gelfand says, A belief in witchcraft encourages good behaviour. If an individual harms another, breaks laws, or becomes anti-social, he lays himself open to the suspicion of being a witch. The Shona child is indoctrinated with distaste for terrible attributes of the witch and taught about the awful end liable to befall such persons. Having had this fear instilled in him/her the average adult chooses good in preference to evil, tries to behave well and endeavours to conform to the ordinary social pattern of his/her community\" (Gelfand 1967: 51). 58 Another positive way of understanding and interpreting the Akan concept of Bayifo is to view it as part of the Akan \"retributive order\". This is clearly seen in the way some Akan people decide to become Abayifo. People may decide to become witches because of their natural tendency to \"pay evil for evil\" or \"to do evil\". They are envious or jealous, or may have had some conflict with their relatives or some other persons within the family or community and want to hurt them as enemies. Enemies can be co-wives, brothers, or sisters, a former husband of a man's wife, or somebody who has taken away a girl friend. A second motive to become a witch is because he or she suspects another person who is in a state of enmity with him or her to be a witch. The only way he/she can prevent being bewitched is to become a witch himself or herself. According to my informants there are ways that people can be protected from the powers of the Abayifo. Once the Okomfo confirms that witchcraft is the cause of some difficulty, he/she will, as a matter of necessity, prescribe what is to be done to rescue the person. One way used to be for the relatives of the sick person to walk up to the suspected witch and give him/her an ultimatum (a certain number of days) to reverse ~ the spell. If the patient did not recover by then, the relatives would machete the suspected witch to death. Although the killing of witches today is not as common as it used to be, there are cases in which this happens. Alternatively today, in almost all cases, a suspected witch is asked to take an oath that he/she is not responsible for the act in question. Highly educated Akan pretend not to believe in the existence of Abayifo, but the fact is that most Akan do secretly visit Abosom and /or spiritualists for potent charms to protect them against Abayifo. Okomfo Afua Nsia said during one interview that election times are usually 59 periods of lucrative business as politicians throng for charms against supernatural attacks by their opponents. 2-6 Concept of Abosom (Onyankopong-Akyeame) The Akan concept of Abosom is related to a local story in three episodes. In the first episode: There was once a certain woman who had eleven children who ate every food she cooked, thus depriving her of anything to eat. She decided to kill them by instructing the silk-cotton tree to pluck off eleven of his branches and kill the children when they came to fetch pumpkins. Duku, the eleventh child revealed their mother's intentions to them and ordered his brothers to throw sticks against the silk-cotton tree. Supposing that the children had come, the silk-cotton tree let off eleven branches to fall to the ground. Duku then reminded his brothers that had they gone over there they would have been killed The children, however, returned home with their pumpkins, and when they were cooked they ate all. In the second episode: With the same motive to kill them, their mother sent the children to Onyame. Before the children were sent, she caused eleven holes to be dug, covered over with stools so that when the children came to sit on them they would fall into the holes and die. Duku saw the trap and remonstrated that the stools were too beautiful for them to sit on. So the design failed. 60 In the third episode: When her design again failed, their mother decided to send the children to collect a golden pipe in Death's village from where no one returns alive. The children arrived in Death's village where Duku was able to foil all her attempts to kill them. In the end Duku was able to collect the pipe requested by the mother and escape with his brothers. As Death pursued them Duku poured some medicine on his brothers and they all went and settled on top of a silk-cotton tree. When Death arrived at the tree she used a magical formula and brought down all the children who fell down. But Duku used the formula known as 'Kyere-he-ne' and also caused the fall and death of Death who had gone up the silk-cotton tree. Duku then sprinkled some medicine on his brothers and they all rose up again, but as the medicine was being thrown away, it accidentally fell on Death who woke up to chase them. The brothers reached a stream and swam across, but as Duku could not swim he turned into a stone. When Death reached the stream she was so disappointed that she took the stone to throw at the brothers who were at the other side of the stream. But as the stone was travelling it said: 'wind take me and set me on the other side'. As it alighted on the other Iam'. Death said: 'Ah, this child! I have no further matter to talk to you about. All I have to say to you is this: 'Go and remain at home and change into one of the lesser gods, and if anyone whom I wish to take comes to where you are, you inform me. If I so desire, I will leave him and make a present of him; but what I wish in exchange you must receive it for me\" This folktale poses two opposing views about Abosom. Some Akan hold the view that the 61 Abosom come from power other than Onyame. There are others who believe that they come from Onyame and that He is ultimately source of their existence. Hence they are his Akyeame (linguists). I will use the latter view. Secondly, in one of the episodes Obosom \"Duku\" changed into a stone. The Akan notion is that the Abosom have the ability to transform into objects such as stones, animals or human beings which they do when they want to inflict punishment on evil-doers in the community. It must be noted that the Akan do not believe that the Abosom were once human beings and later transformed into Abosom. This would imply that their Abosom have a beginning. The Akan believe that the Abosom existed before the universe came into being. As Murray has rightly pointed out \"if Olympian gods were not there to start with, how did they originate?\" (Murray 1946: 22). According to Akan myth, the rivers such as Tano, Bea, Lake Bosomtwe, and Bosompo, the mighty Ocean, were the children of Onvame, who decided to send them down to the earth, in order that they might receive benefits from, and confer them upon, mankind. This is evident in the following Akan myth. Onyame planned where he would send each of his children. But the goat came to know of these plans and told his friend Bea that whenever their father sent for them, he should go to him quickly so that he would arrive before his brothers. One day Onyame sent for his children and Bea ran quickly ahead of the others, so the father assigned to him the cool and shady forest country which had been intended for Jano, the favourite one. Tano therefore was sent to the grassy plains, and each child in turn was given a place different from the original plan. This was the result of goat having revealed the plan to Bea. 62 In this myth, the Abosom are \"children\" of Onyame. As his sons they are lesser or lower than Onyame as in the Akan family system where \"sons are subordinate to their fathers\". But they share the same \"essence\" with Onyame, or as the Akan axiom puts it, Okoto nwo anoma, which is translated as \"A crab does not give birth to a bird\". In other words, \"Like father, like son'. The son is the continuation of the existence of the father - what a father is, is what the child is. Hence, the ritual of a grandfather spitting into the mouth of his grandson after eight days of his/her birth, a way of transmitting his personality-soul to the newly born baby. In the same way Onyame gives his (spirit) to the Abosom who are his sons. In the Akan worldview, the Abosom are Onyame-Abrafo. Obrafo is the one who carries out \"death-sentence\"'. It is he who implements the orders of the king, and he is greatly feared person, Abosom as Onyame-Abrafo is thus indicative of the function of the Abosom as executors of divine justice. Such Abosom are depicted as holding in their hands knives, guns, and clubs in discharging their duties as upholders of moral order (Fadipe 1970: 261). According to my informants, if Onyame had not given us the Abosom, then witches would have destroyed mankind. In their function as guardians of morality, the Abosom are regarded as beings with absolute power for good or evil. Their absolute power is evidenced in the prayers and sacrifices directly addressed to them. The Abosom are not only Onyame-Abrafo, but also are Onyame-Akyeame. According to Akan belief, the 4bosom derive their power from the Supreme Being. They come from him and are parts of him. An Obosom is but the mouthpiece of the Supreme Being Onyame-Akyeame, \"'a servant acting as intermediary between Creator and creature\" (Busia 1954: 193). 63 The Okyeame (linguist or spokesman) is the first officer of every Akan traditional society. He deputises for the king on matters affecting the laws and customs of a particular state and as such he must be eloquent in speech, virtuous in morals, dignified, and impressive in appearance. Without him, the king cannot speak for he is the official intermediary between the king and his subjects. As Field points out \"He is indeed the 'mouth' and 'ear' of the king\" (Field 1969: 90). The phrase the \"mouth\" and \"ear\" of the king means that he is the only person, other than the chief's wife, who is permitted to visit the chief in his chamber, and thus the only person who can confer with him without witness of the conference or council. In the court and on all other formal occasions, no one else is supposed to address the chief directly. In other words, a person addresses the Okyeame, and the Okyeame repeats the message to the chief. Any request for an audience with the chief must pass through him, and, if he is unsympathetic, the matter can go no further. When the Akan thus refer to the \"Abosom as linguists or servants of Onyame \", they are alluding to their political system which stipulates when they have problems, they do not present them directly to the king, but to his linguist or spokesman, even when the king is present. In the same way, the Akan hold the view that Onyame, being the crown of creation, must not be addressed directly, but through the Abosom (Busia 1954: 193). Most of the Akan Abosom are in the form of rivers attached to towns and villages. In the past, after founding of a new village, the chief and his elders would pave a path to the river and pour a libation to the river-god to take care of the chief, the elders, men, women and children of the new township. Then a sheep was slaughtered and the meat was scattered in bits over the 64 banks of the river. In the evening, the gong-gong was beaten to announce the name of the river (Obosom) and its taboos, which every one was to keep. The breach of these taboos resulted in the slaughtering of sheep or payment of a fine (Mends 1972: 24). The Akan believe that their Abosom are free ranging divinities who put themselves into contact with humans from time to time by possessing individuals. In this way, communication can be established between humans and Obosom and the wishes of one are made known to the other. Before this can be done fully and easily, however, man or woman has to be trained by priests to become an Okomfo. Besides indigenous Abosom, the Akan import Abosom from outside. According to oral tradition, the first foreign Obosom in Akan society was Aberewa, literally (the old woman) about 1900. But the Christian missionaries then active in Akan society saw this Aberewa as a potential rival to their own proselytising which was at that period making slow headway and so they exerted pressure on the colonial Administration and concocted reports of torture and extortion and accusations of witchcraft. The administration quickly suppressed the Aberewa and destroyed its paraphernalia. In the Akan society today, the most powerful, popular and foreign Obosom is Obosom Tigare in Nsiakrom. It 1s careful not to give offence to the government, and has been allowed to continue to practise although it is closely watched and even licensed by both the District Secretary and Omanhene (paramount chief). This is the Obosom Tigare we will examine in details in the next chapter. 65 2-7 Concept of Mmoatia (dwarfs) The other type of spiritual being in the Akan sacred worldview is Mmoatia (dwarfs). These are little people, usually invisible to ordinary people. The Mmoatia are only two spans tall and their feet are turned backwards. They converse among themselves and with humans by whistling. People say that they can sometimes hear them talking early in the morning and the evening on the outskirts of villages. The Akan believe that the Mmoatia appear like human beings; but as spiritual beings, they can disguise themselves and assume many different forms. They also come in three different colours and two different presentations. Rattray states that: ... The black fairies are the more or less innocuous, but the white and the red mmoatia are up to all kind of mischief, such as stealing house-wives' palm wine and the food left over from the previous day (Rattray 1927: 26). However, my informants said that almost all Mmoatia are benevolent and that only a few are bad. Several informants said that the late Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the President of the First Republic of Ghana, had the aid of Mmoatia during the national elections campaign in 1950-51. Nkrumah was then in prison, but with the aid of the Mmoatia, his spirit could make nocturnal visits to chiefs and people who were opposing him and persuaded them to follow him. Indeed, almost every Okomfo 1s considered to have learned his/her arts from the Mmoatia. Okomfo Afua Nsiah of the village of Nsiakrom is believed to be in league with the Mmoatia. She often goes into the deepest thickest of the forest for long periods of time to confer with her Mmotia. There they feed her with information and discuss problems that confront her clients. Not only individuals that are attached, but also groups can be attached to Mmoatia. One 66 such group is a soccer team in the Central region of Ghana, called the Abusua Dwarfs, which is literally translated as \"The Eleven Dwarfs \". In my interview with the President of the team, he told me that every player is served by Mmoatia as an invisible helper and when the team goes to the field to play, they number \"twenty-two\" instead of the regular \"eleven\". While the game is on, the Mmoatia transfigure into vultures and continually circle the field. He explains further that with the supernatural power of the Mmoatia on their side, \"The Eleven Dwarfs\" has never lost any of their league matches. The members of the team are sworn never to divulge the secret of their power. Seven days before each match, taboos are observed against sexual relations, food prepared by a woman, and there is total abstinence from alcoholic beverages. The players take a ritual bath in the ocean. But if a player leaves the team, they say, he will never again be able to play soccer with any degree of skill (personal communication June 1998). The Nzema tribe in the Western region of Ghana is a well-known place for the purchase of Mmoatia powers if people so desire. The people there are believed to be the richest ethnic group in the region because of their relationship to the dwarfs. The richest person of this tribe, who owns a racetrack, is said to exercise particular control over the dwarfs and as a result people from other regions travel to the Nzema tribe to buy their \"dwarf\" powers in the form of Suman (charm) fetish (Rattray 1927: 28). According to my informants, the Nzema never use their dwarfs to kill or do evil deeds. They only use them to cure diseases and do good. For instance, if a man comes to them with an injured arm, the leg of a sheep is broken and both legs are bound with leaves. The dwarfs are then invoked and when the leg of the sheep is healed, the arm of the man is also healed. 67 There are two general ways to obtain aid from Mmoatia. The first is by direct contact with them. An individual may initiate contact with dwarfs by a course of ritual fasting in the Okomfo's house or in the forest. Abstinence from sexual relations and alcoholic beverages is mandatory. During this time certain incantations and songs are learned, including the dwarfs whistling language, by which the Mmoatia may be controlled. One also learns how to feed the dwarfs. The most common practice is to pour them a libation of palm wine or gin, but a more formal means is the placing of food at Nkwanta-nnan (a crossroad). This offering is always laid on a sheet of white calico, though formerly white bark cloth was used. On the sheet is set an unused earthen pot containing Eto (mashed yam and boiled eggs sprinkled with palm oil), or white kola, or a number of coins (usually ten cedis pieces). Direct pieces of ten cowries would be used instead of the ten coins. The risk with direct contact with Mmoatia is that they may possess the individual and cause them to behave in a exceedingly erratic fashion. After such an occurrence the possessed will experience great physical hunger and thirst. The second way of obtaining aid from the Mmoatia is by means of Suman or charms prepared by them or by a person with whom they are in direct contact. These charms can be purchased or obtained through a crossroad offering. The power attributed to the Mmoatia and their charms are extremely varied. One who controls them can send them anywhere, uncover any secret through them, and accomplish anything he or she desires if he/she fulfils his/her duties to them. They are particularly useful in protecting one if thieves attack. Their main use, though, is in gaining riches, prestige, women, or other desirable items. In rare cases the Mmoatia are believed to kill; one Mmoatia in ten is supposed to be evil and if a person can acquire an evil 68 dwarf, he is credited with the ability to cause illness or death. If one obtains two such dwarfs, he/she is a very dangerous person indeed. 2-8 The Emergence of Obosom Tigare The Akan worldview I have discussed provides the framework within which Obosom Tigare emerged in the Akan land. The Akan worldview explains how every being came into being and how all things which existed are related to each other. Connected to this are notions of right and wrong, what one ought to do, and what one ought to avoid. But the encounter between the Akan people and the outside world brought many changes in the Akan land. Some of the changes are the introduction of Islam, and Christianity. But to the native, the most negative influence was the introduction of the cocoa industry. The Akan saying is Kokoo see Abusua which is interpreted as \"Cocoa destroys family\". Their explanation is that cocoa has brought a very marked acceleration of economic change and greater dependence upon forces over which the Akan themselves have no control. For example, they had no cure for the disease that threatened the trees. The only cure was to cut down the trees. Then they had no trees and income. Also, they had no control over the price of the product. This situation in modern Akan land was such that individuals felt disoriented and anxious - in economic life and in kinship relationships in particular. Many turned to a new religious movement known as Abosom-brafo which means \"Executioner-abosom\"', or simply \"New Abosom\" focused on witchcraft. Others turned to the Obosom Tigare. In an interview with an informant as to why the Obosom Tigare was brought to the Akan land Okyame Badu replied, 69 \"the old cults did not meet the new situation\". In others words the situation was unprecedented and the old cults were apparently too rigid for adaptation. Perhaps another reason was that the old Abosom declined in power due to a direct attack made on them by Christian missions and the Government. How far did Obosom Tigare actually meet the religious needs of the contemporary Akan, and why did it take the form it did? Detailed answers will be provided in the following chapters, but I summarize here by saying that it attracted and continues to attract the Akan people for the following reasons. From its beginning the Obosom Tigare as new religious movement emphased the importance of the healing power of Obosom Tigare and the opportunities this provided for new forms of \"medicine\". Hence the practitioners called it Aduro ye, which means \"Medicine is good\". The practitioners of the movement believed that the cult always answered the \"requests\" of her followers. The movement also adopted some of the old cult practices. For example, it stresses the importance of dreams, visions, and spirit possession, which reflects a continuing interest in the issues of destiny present in the traditional system. The Akan people view them as the sources of information and direction. They illuminate the causes of problems and identify courses action to be taken. Thus the practitioners of Obosom Tigare are every bit as interested as the traditional-oriented Akan in knowing the future and what acts are to be performed in assuring progress in the right direction. The other attraction of the movement lays in its reordering of Akan traditional symbols. For example, the existence and power of witchcraft is not denied, but Obosom Tigare can make them \"jump out of the way\". The efficacy of traditional medicine 1s not denied. 70 All this demonstrates the flexibility of the Akan religious system and its internal power to make new forms out of the old forms in the presence of new directions. Therein lies the power of a religious system in concept and practice \u2014 in established and novel ways to provide an intricate and interesting context for the living of a good life. In the world of today, the practitioners believe that Obosom Tigare is not only a new religious movement but also a supplement to, and continuation of, the Old Abosom rituals and organisation. As a result of the belief in malevolent spirits, many people have become participants at Tigare ceremonies because of the reputation of Tigare for \"catching\" Abayifo and its effectiveness as a prophylaxis against evil magic. Adherents are not limited to those who believe they are being victimized, but include, also, many who come because they derive a feeling of security, an effect the Obosom Tigare has in common other religions. It not unusual, for example, to see some of the same people at a Tigare ceremony on Awukuadae (Wednesday) that were seen in attendance at a Christian service on Sunday. Every Obosom Tigare priest/priestess interviewed maintained that there were both Christians and Muslims among her followers. 71 Chapter 3 The Nature of Obosom Tigare's Cult 3-1 Receiving an Obosom According to Nsiah an Obosom is something to be \"received\" and there are three ways of receiving an Obosom, namely by Nyikyere (disclosure), Adedie (inheritance) and Yadee (pain or suffering). By Nyikyere, a person may go to the forest and suddenly discovers an object charged with fire. The discoverer brings the object home and builds a shrine for it. The novice is initiated into the mysteries of the priesthood so that he/she can understand and interpret the will of the Obosom that has disclosed himself to him/her. He/she then becomes the priest/priestess of the Obosom who has thus revealed himself. The second, Adidie (inheritance), is perhaps the more common means of receiving an Obosom. The Obosom may belong to the family and be transmitted through the blood's life force from one generation to another. The Akan categorise such Abosom as Fie Bosom, which is literally translated as \"family Obosom\"'. It is assumed that anyone who is born into the lineage has an inherent spiritual affinity with that particular deity and may exhibit some of the propensities or capacities of that Obosom (Verger 1957). The third is by Yadee (pain or suffering). Osei Kofi related this to me in a personal conversation. At the age of twenty-two Kofi started to act strangely, to talk to himself, and sometimes to strip himself naked. At such times he became unusually strong and difficult to restrain. His family elders tried treatment at a Roman Catholic hospital at Asafo, where the 72 doctors recommended sending Kofi to a mental hospital at Ankafo in the central region. For a year and half Kofi underwent Western psychiatric treatment with no sign of improvement. Eventually the family removed him from there and brought him back to Sefwi, where they carried him, in the face of scandal, to Obosom Kobiri shrine even though he was a devout Catholic. Before they could speak to the priest at the shrine, the priest glanced in Kofi's direction and divined that the young man was not mentally ill but possessed by a powerful spirit of the stream at their village. The spirit of the stream wanted the young man to be his priest, and unless he did so no amount of treatment would do any good. So Kofi and the family yielded, and he trained to be the priest of the shrine. The story of the origin of Obosom Tigare has two versions. The first story says: The discoverer was a hunter, who during one of his hunting expeditions in Yiapala remained in the bush for several days. When he was found he behaved in an abnormal way and the people in the community thought that he was going mad, until an older priest declared that he had been possessed by an Obosom. He was subsequently initiated into the priesthood of the Obosom Tigare who possessed him. The second oral tradition says: The discoverer saw a tortoise and brought it home. When he dissected it, he discovered 'Befe' (a sponge) and 'Nufa' (cones of medicine). He then took the tortoise to the Odikro (owner of village), and informed him what he had discovered. After some deliberations, they concluded an Obosom might want to disclose itself to the people of that land 73 Consequently, the Odikro and his elders called for a senior priest to explain and interpret the phenomenon. When he came he said that an Obosom desired to pick the discoverer to be its priest. The senior priest made incisions on his body, rubbed the ears and the eyes with herbal juice so that he might see the Obosom daily, and he gave him some training. After the training, he set up a cult in Yiapala and welcomed clients from all over the country. The real Obosom Tigare is \"a black bag\" which was the original item found in the tortoise. But it has included other items such as a stool, a spear and a knife, skulls of a dog and a cat, large and small drums, pieces of kola-nuts, a rattle and a gong-gong (plate # 2). The Obosom Tigare has attracted clients from all over the area because its mission is to track down evil doers and help humans to develop their potentialities. The owner of the cult does not charge a high fee for somebody who wants to set up a sister-cult in his/her locality. The only demand is a token of five cedis coin (Ghana currency) and two pieces of kola-nut as a \"gift exchange\" (Mauss Aseda (thank- Aseda is vital in the transferring of \"spiritual power\" to another person. It is believed that without the Aseda, the power which inhabits the object, will not work effectively until something has been paid or exchanged for it. The Aseda in Akan cultural transaction is interpreted as Wohyira so ama me, which means \"He/she has blessed it for me\". The pronouncement of blessing is believed to enable the power; without it, the power is null and void. The Aseda is in a way a reward of the Okomfo, for Okomfo accepts nothing more than Aseda (Wooding 1973: 51). For those who charge a fee, it is believed that their power does not 74 stay with them for long. For proper supervision of the power, the owner of Obosom Tigare demands an annual pilgrimage to Yiapala. The purpose of this annual pilgrimage is to ensure that the rules and prohibitions are observed. Should someone be unable to make the pilgrimage, he sends a delegation. When they come to Yiapala, he offers freely additional powers to some of the shrines whose powers are declining. Sometimes the owner of the Yiapala cult also sends a delegation who acts as a \"mediators\" and settles disputes when on the trek. Through this annual pilgrimage, the owner has maintained a symbiotic relationship with his clients in the \"South\" (map #1). On the other hand, the pilgrimage to the North has reduced the number of people who want to set up the cults in their localities. The journey from southern to the northern part of Ghana is risky and expensive. On arrival in their own localities, local chiefs charge substantial sums before they are granted permission to set one up. Besides the expenses, running the cult also requires a certain level of experience. These obstacles have restricted the Obosom Tigare cult to the more affluent and senior people in the Akan community. 3-2 Setting the Cult in Nsiakrom The receiving of an Obosom through \"sickness\" is what happened to Okomfo Afua Nsiah. In an interview Okomfo declares: of Ashanti parentage in the Asante Akim district of Ghana in the 1940s, is the only surviving child of the eight children of the late Madam Akua Sarponmaa and Opayin Osei Kwadwo. All her brothers and sisters died under the age of 75 twenty, a phenomenon which the Akan find it difficult to accept. Thus, when Afua Nsiah reached marriageable age, several potential husbands had wanted to marry her but were all scared because of her family history. It was only Opayin Fosu who, despite her family background, married her at the age of nineteen. Immediately after the marriage, the couple travelled to Yiapala and sought spiritual protection from Obosom Tigare. They stayed in the village for several years after which Afua Nsiah offered to become a priestess. After her training the couple returned to Patriansa and there she started practising the art. Okomfo Afua Nsiah has ten children all alive, with a number of grandchildren. In Akan cosmology, when a woman loses babies consecutively, there are two theories: Kosan (going and coming) theory and Enye kwa (there-is-nothing like chance) theory. The Kosan theory is that there are some children who delight in playing tricks with the mother by \"going and coming\". To prevent the mischievous child from molesting the mother in this way, the Akan impose on such children funny names such as Sumina (incinerator), Donko (slave), Asaseasa (the land-is-exhausted), Bosuo (dew), Totwene (throw-it-away). With such a funny name, it is believed, the child will be ashamed to \"return\" (Sarpong 1986: 4). The Enye annko ka papa a, anka papa nye gradaa, which is translated literally as \"when you hear a twig creak, even if you do not see why, you must assume something has touched it\". The Akan believe that hidden causes do have demonstrable effects. And so death has root causes. When only one person out of a busload dies in an accident, and snakebite kills one out of four who walk along 76 the road, it is not for nothing. The Akan's view is that such happenings are indicators of the presence and operations of some spiritual being or beings (Oduyoye 1983: 120). This was believed the case with Okomfo Afua Nsiah's brothers and sisters. During the interview, I asked her why she sought spiritual protection from the North. Her answer was that the \"Southerners\" perceive Seremfo, the (\"Northerners\"') as people who possess powerful \"medicine\". Most Akan travel to the north to purchase medicine. \"In these days\", an informant said, \"there is much bad influence trying to break down trade, and we need more strength to repel it\". She gives instances of groups and individuals who have travelled to the north for Aduro. As she puts it: The medicine, which the chief bought about fourteen years ago, was from the Northern Territories. The chief consulted the elders before buying it and the town contributed towards its purchase. I do not know the price, but it is very expensive. The Akan go to the North to \"purchase\" medicine for various reasons. To some people, it is for spiritual protection; to others it is to find the cause of an event or a problem related to economics. As one informant put it: A medicine was purchased to bring diamonds to the surface, to influence the will of prospectors and to frustrate the evil intentions of town enemies who, by magic, might cause the diamonds to recede deep into the earth and the minds of prospectors to be turned elsewhere. Okomfo Afua Nsiah complained that she did not find security in the Christian religion in her village. She explained that Christianity in one form or another did not provide an adequate 77 explanation of economic failures, misfortunes, sudden death, and illnesses. She told me that Obosom Tigare provided the answers she needed, and that was the main reason she also brought it to her people. When the cult was established in Patrainsa, it was not officially known until a young woman fell sick in their village, and after seeking a series of hospital treatments did not get well. Rather, the sickness increased in severity. She complained of pains in the joints and the belly. Finally, the family consulted a local medicine man and was told she had been \"caught\" by Obosom Tigare. They confronted their daughter and she admitted that she was a witch. She confessed \"she had been seeing a giant from the North\" who had been beating her with a club and it was through the beating that she had received from this giant, that had given her the pains\". She was quickly rushed to Okomfo Afua Nsiah who confirmed that the \"confession\" was true. The husband and the family promised a sheep, a dozen eggs and six bottles of schnapps should the cult spare the life of the victim and return her to normality. She recovered after a couple of weeks. Similar cases were referred to the cult and many outsiders joined it. Finally, the whole town became interested and sought a new site to set it up. A delegation was sent to the Omanhene (paramount chief) to inform him about the new Obosom that had been introduced in his area. Another delegation was sent to the North to fetch additional powers to widen its scope. The Obosom Tigare replaced the \"old methods\" of witch finding \"Carrying of the corpse\" is to ascertain the cause of a death. When the casket is being carried to the grave, it 1s 78 believed that the spirit of the deceased will cause the bearers to walk toward the person who killed him/her, even if the suspect is not present at the burial. The accused person is then tried to prove his/her innocence. \"Trial by ordeal\" requires that the accused drink a poison extracted from the bark of an Odum tree. If he/she survives, he/she is presumed innocent. The other techniques is \"drinking from Atumpan drum\" which is still practised, although it is by no means common. The Atumpan drum is designed to extract confessions from suspects, such as of adultery or stealing. Water plus some special herbs are washed from the leather of the drum poured into a Kora (calabash) and the suspect is asked to drink it. It is believed that if the accused person does not tell the truth, the power in the Atumpan drum will bring about his/her death. The other method is to require the accused to carry the Atumpan drum while someone is beating it. It is believed that the spirits in the drum will possess the accused and make them confess. The government banned these old methods, but did not provide an alternative. Most people hold the view that it is Obosom Tigare who came to fill the void. One old woman said: Now, the Akan do have another way of establishing the cause of illness and the cure. Death, though, cannot be eliminated from human society, yet it can be prolonged. It is believed that the vacuum which was created has been filled. Obosom Tigare is reported to be particularly efficacious at \"catching evil\", as well as at providing protection against evil magic. The cult's ability to adapt to the needs of people is one of Tigare successes. In the cult's home, she 1s mainly concerned with rain and the fertility of the land. But as soon as the cult was 79 established in Nsiakrom she also became capable of dealing with witchcraft as well. She offers protection, assistance and deals with new social needs such as job securing, economic gains, and travelling. Other benefits include health, the increasing emphasis on aids for and the needs of the modern world. Because Obosom Tigare acts quickly, to many people, it is believed, to have abandoned Suman and Aduro. As one young man puts it: If you use Aduro to help you, you must call upon him every time, and tell him what you want. But once you have drunk Obosom Tigare he will protect you from theft, witchcraft, and adultery without your thinking any more about it. The many supplicants I interviewed said that, unlike Suman and Aduro, Obosom Tigare has the ability to know human hearts and is able to expose evil doers and kill witches as well as those who plot evil. The concern is for life in the physical sense and long and prosperous days on earth free from illness and untimely death. At Nsiakrom the cult's main concern is Nkwa (life), a fact that comes across in many of the Abisa (requests) such as: Yesre wo Nkwa, Yesre wo adom, \"We pray for life, we pray for grace'. Thus one of the main factors which attracts members to Obosom Tigare is the \"curative\" and \"protective\" powers of the cult. The Abisa is to avoid Mmusuo. The term Mmusuo covers mischief, misfortune, adversity, misery, disaster and calamity. It embraces all the ills that are heir to flesh such as illnesses, death, lack of prosperity and poor harvest. The reason why people come for Abisa is that life is full of unknown dangers and uncertainties it can only be made tolerable by a security system which is obtained through the knowledge of Obosom Tigare. As soon as one hears of it, he/she takes precaution. As the Akan 80 axiom explains: Mate masie, na mada me ho so, which is literally translated, \"Once I have been told, I have taken precautions\". To every Akan the Abisa is another dimension of solving problems, the most significant of which is insecurity. 3-3 Abosom-mma (children of Obosom) The members of Nsiakrom community call themselves Abosom-mma, which 1s interpreted as \"Children of Obosom\"'. To the natives the Obosom-mma are individuals who for one reason or another have left their original families and allied themselves to a deity which espouses a definite lifestyle and set of beliefs. They believe it is the priestess and the shrine that play important roles in their lives and they worship the Obosom Tigare, not stools and the ancestors as do other Akan. The Obosom Tigare has to eat their most important farm produce first at the end of the farming season before the people are allowed to eat themselves. The significance of this belief is well illustrated in the song which the women sing themselves as they pound the streets with Woma (pounding sticks for Fufu) at dawn: Yeye Obosom-mma, We are children of Obosom. Wonka yen, No one should touch us. Yeye Obosom-mma, We are children of Obosom. Wonka yen 81 No one should touch us. In addition to these words, they use the name of Obosom in singing praises: Obosom Tigare na wo bekum yen nyarewa yi ama yen, You have come to heal all our wounds, Awura ba ee! The Mighty One! Wo Nkwa so! Long Life Tigare! The practitioners firmly believe that Obosom Tigare will be able to cure all their diseases, and so they are thankful to him. Thus the concept Obosom-mma represents the whole Nsiakrom town community. But within this general category there are other small groups such as Efieni (household member), Busuani (clan member), and Kuromni (countryman/woman). Ffieni refers to identity. For example, Wo firi efie ben mu, \"which house do you come from?\" does not refer to a physical structure but to the person's identity in the society. In reckoning members of one's family, the Akan say: Yefiri efie kro mu, house\". Yefri efie koro mu, can also mean, \"We are all from the same womb\", which carries the same idea of group identity (Assimeng 1976: 79). When the people in the community want to refer to personal identity they use Efie instead of Abosom-mma. Another important sub-group in Nsiakrom community is the Busuani (clan-member). The 82 Akan idea of Busuani is that membership is predetermined by heredity. That is, one does not join a clan, for it is not a voluntary organisation. He/she is born into it. The clan membership, therefore, is discriminating and exclusive (Oduyoye 1991: 467). In Nsiakrom, each clan has its definite rules of relationships and alliances. The members call themselves Menua-mmarima \"brothers\" and Menua-mma \"sisters\" and regard the rest of the clans as \"others\". As brothers and sisters they cannot marry within the same clan, a rule which Sarpong terms as \"exogamy\" (Sarpong 1974). The clan has Obaapayin (a senior woman), who represents the woman, and Abusuapayin (a senior man) who also represents the men. Both answer questions on marriages and other domestic matters. Whenever a patient comes to Nsiakrom for aid he/she first asks for Abusuapayin or Obaapayin of his/her clan and makes his/her presence known. Once he/she makes him/herself known, it is the responsibility of the Abusuapayin or Obapayin to help the person find an accommodation and meet all other needs. When I first arrived at Nsiakrom, an old woman came to me and asked Wo bo Abusua ben? \"Which of the eight clans do you belong to?\" I replied \"I do not know'. She said to me: \"By custom no Akan is expected to operate as an individual or an isolated being. Try to find out from your Abusapayin the clan you belong to and study the family history, its rootedness, and connectedness\"'. I was very much ashamed of this omission in my life as an Akan. And so before I came to Canada I tried to find to which Abusua I belonged. It turned out to be the Aduana family; and our 83 symbolic animal is Etwea \"a dog\", which is believed by the group to be the animal who first brought fire into the Akan land and taught the Aduana ancestors/ancestresses how to prepare it (Rattray 1929 131). Hence, we are forbidden to eat dog flesh. In daily conversation, people of Nsiakrom may refer to people as Me kuromni, \"people who come from the same country\" or simply \"country/woman\". For example, there are people from the Ivory Coast, Republic of Benin and others countries. However, to the Akan, the term Me kuromni has three meanings. First, it can refer to people who are able to communicate efficiently in a particular language. Second, it may refer to people who share the same religious and material culture. Third, it may be people who are responsible for caring for one another in a foreign land. It appears to me that the life in Nsiakrom community embraces all the three definitions. Nsiakrom, then, is a communal culture. The well being of each person is the group's responsibility. The survival of the community depends upon the ability of each of its members to produce not only for themselves but also for others. This ethic is embedded in Akan axioms and proverbs such as: Baakofo were aduro a egu One finger cannot lift a thing. Dua baako ntumi nye kwae One tree cannot build a forest Ahohosom (hospitality) is the hallmark of Nsiakrom community life. The Okomfo Afua Nsiah, for example, was so generous to others that one day she got into trouble with her spouse on food. 84 The spouse wondered where all the food had she had spent the whole day preparing had gone? Okomfo Afua Nsiah answered that she had given them to strangers. Her conviction was to \"keep doing good, that is what Obosom Tigare wants\". She concluded with the following admonition: Food that is not shared with others will be finished. You will be satisfied to a point where you cannot eat any more\". If you have not shared your food with others, how can you, in jairness, share your problem or even joys with them? The Akan maintain that in order to live a human life one needs conversation; one needs to be related to others, and not necessarily just one's own immediate consanguineous circle. In time of trouble one may need these people to come to his/her aid. The Akan put this philosophy of life in proverbial form: Wo nko didi a wo nko wone. \"When you have eaten alone you do not expect another to accompany you on nature's call, especially in the night\" In the company of Okomfo Afua Nsiah I learned first hand the deep meaning of Akan spirituality. She never missed an occasion to visit a sick person in the community. She would always attend funeral rites. She was always present on such occasions as the puberty rites of girls in the community. She made it a point to be present when cases were being settled before the chief or elders. She never harbours a grudge against anybody without telling him/her about her dissatisfaction. All this left a deep impression on my mind. I lament that as an Akan I am unable to express this spirituality. Apart from what I gained from Okomfo Afua Nsiah, I also learned Akan spirituality from the community. The first is \"the care and love one another\". The community reinforces this in the form of warnings: Wo tan wo yonko ba a, wo ba wu apreapere, which is literally translated as: 85 \"If you hate your fellow's children, your own children die sudden death'. In Nsiakrom \"parents\" are fathers and mothers to all children. Similarly, the children regard all elders as parents. Children are constantly admonished of their responsibility to care for their parents with the following proverb: Obi hwe wo ma wo se firifiri a, wo nso hwe no ma ne se ntutu. It is translated as \"if somebody takes care of someone while the person is a child (growing teeth), it behoves on the later to take care of the person in his/her old age (losing teeth)\". In their old age when people are no longer able to produce, where there is no income for them, they still need food and shelter to survive; and young people become the logical extension of strength for the old people in the community. The young ones must work to provide their own needs as well as the needs of the old and the weak in the community (Owoahene-Acheampong 1994: 195). The corollary of connectedness is the fear of \"barrenness and impotency\" which is seen as a threat to Akan community life. This comes out clearly in their Apayee (prayers). The Apayee is in two forms: male and female. The male Apayee relates to impotency and reads thus: Mma mani anwu awia, Do not let me become blind in the afternoon, Mma mani nwu anadwo, Do not let me become blind in the night (that is not to be impotent), Mma mani nwu koraa, Let me be \"whole\"'. The female Apayee, which also reflects barrenness, reads: Momma me nye abonini, 86 Do not let me be a barren woman Abosompem, monkopra mma mmere me Mighty Abosom the land, go and sweep children for them Badu dwan, nto mmerewa badin Let them bring forth \"tenth born\" and name them after you our ancestors/ancestresses. While physical blindness is seen as a handicap and deserves sympathy, Okrawa (impotency) and Abonini (barrenness) are considered deserving of pity. The community strongly encourages the young to marry and produce children. Their view that \"it is important for a man to marry; it is more important to marry and have children; but it is most important to marry and have female children\". When a new baby is born, people usually ask, Wowoo den or Oyee den? \"What is it?\" On hearing it is the women say, Yeda Onyame ase! \"We thank God!\" When it is Obarima (a boy), they shrug and say, Ah eye! \"Well, it is OK\" (Sarpong 1977: 8). But this does not mean that the community loves female children more than male. Male children play a dominant role in Akan society, as it is evident in their axioms: Obaa to tuo a, etwere barima dan mu. (Should a woman purchase a gun, it is the man who keeps it). According to the indigenous view, a woman is like a flower in a garden that needs a man to fence around it. Hence, when husband and wife sleep, the woman always sleeps at the back and the man at the front. Similarly, when going to farm, the woman is at the front and the man is at the back. The interpretation is that the man provides protection and defence for the woman. In the Nsiakrom community, it is improper for a woman to look for, or ask for, a 87 husband. Even when both male and female have agreed to marry, it is the male who pushes forward. He goes to his father through an elderly person to indicate his wish to marry. If his father and the family approve, it is the father who approaches the girl's father to initiate the procedures for the marriage between their children. The girl's father then asks for time to consider and both families enter into a form of \"mutual spying\" (Sarpong 1974). This \"mutual spying\" is to find out if there is any hereditary diseases in the family, like madness, epilepsy, and so on; or if any criminal activity has gone on; or if there is a huge debt outstanding. Anything that might bring embarrassment or disgrace on either family is investigated. Once both parties are satisfied that there is nothing harmful in the way, they notify each other of their approval. According to the Akan, Awadie ne kwan ware, \"marriage is a journey of which the end is far\". The Akan idea of marriage as a journey is that \" the journey begins from \"mutual spying stage\" to \"child bearing\" stage. The journey ends when children who are born into the marriage. In the marriage process, the young man's father proposes a day and the father and a family delegation appear at the girl's family house with gifts such as drinks, like Schnapps, rum, and token cash presents for the girl's mother and other women in the family as a \"bridewealth'\"'. The bridewealth is not to purchase a wife but is rather a gift to the wife's family to ensure them that the husband will be capable to care of woman. It also shows the husbands' appreciation of his wife's fidelity and devotion to her family. The last but not the least, is to call upon the both \"living\" and the \"living-dead\" to be witnesses to the marriage. The Akan traditional marriage is understood to bring together not just two individuals but 88 whole families, divorce is extremely complex, especially when children are born from the marriage. The Akan say: Mma wo mu which is translated literally to mean, \"there are children involved.\" To them, they are living links between the two groups. Thus, even though the parents may separate, the marriage, in the sense of the union between the two families, remains intact. The children cannot be cut off from the families that have given birth to them. 3-4 Abisa (consulting Obosom Tigare) Consultation with Obosom Tigare is not, however, limited to instances where there is illness to be cured. People also seek help on the following occasions: 1. A woman cannot conceive a child. The situation admits two kinds of explanation: either the husband is infertile or the wife is barren. The uncertainty of the situation arises from the difficulty of knowing whether the woman will ever conceive a child (temporary barrenness is not uncommon). 2. A woman has along and difficult labor. Okomfo Afua Nsiah 1s consulted to find out whether the cause is \"spirit\" or not. If spirit is involved, that particular spirit is appeased through sacrificed. 3. A man about to marry. Okomfo Afua Nsiah is consulted to find out whether the wife will bear children or not, whether or not the marriage will bring blessedness and good fortune, and so forth. 4. Amanis about to brush his farm. Okomfo Afua Nsiah is consulted to find out whether or not there are bush spirits in the vicinity so that the propitiatory sacrifices can be made to them. 89 5. A person is about to embark upon a journey. Okomfo Afua Nsiah is consulted to find out whether or not one will return safely or accomplish one's mission. 6. A person is troubled by a dream. Okomfo is consulted to find out whether or not it is auspicious. 7. A kinsman is ill. Okomfo Afua Nsiah is consulted to find out whether the sickness 1s \"natural\" or caused by human agency. 8. A man is about to build a house. Okomfo Afua Nsia directs appropriate sacrifices for the house site; she also judges whether or not the site is \"clear\" of the influences of the spirits of previous settlers. In all the above situations, Abisa 1s a ritual means of making a choice. Okomfo Afua Nsiah makes unequivocal decisions concerning her clients who are either auspicious or inauspicious. The clients offer sacrifices to avert disaster or to ward off evil or to assist the realization of an auspicious forecast. Failure to offer the sacrifice or to follow the exact instructions given for it increases one's chances of being struck down by ill fortune. The requests made of Obosom Tigare by adherents are the same type as are asked of the ancestors/ancestresses and the nature deities, except that there have been some additions. Obosom Tigare has two separate apartments \u2014 a male section known as Fiekesemu (male quarters) and a female section known as Mmaamu (women's quarters). The Fiekesemu is the main residence of Obosom Tigare. The cult's paraphernalia and all-important properties such as stools, boxes, gold, beads, ear rings, etc., are kept here for safekeeping. The key to this house is always with Okomfo Afua Nsia (head of the family). Feikesemu is the place where the Abosom 90 and all other religious rituals are performed. Mmaamu (female section) on the other hand, is the place where most of the patients of the priestess are lodged. It is the residence of Okomfo Afua Nsia; all matters pertaining to treatments of patients are mostly resolved there. As the female residence, males should not stay long here. Those who refuse to adhere to this tradition are given names such as Okotobonku, which literally means \"a male who hangs around with women in the kitchen\". Similarly, female patients and assistants are not allowed to stay in the Fiekese for long. The reason is that it is reserved for receiving guests who wish to consult the oracle for the first time. It is in the Fiekesemu where they meet the linguist and state briefly why they wish to consult the cult. No one else is supposed to hear. Then the message is transmitted to Okomfo Afua Nsiah who either asks that the visitor waits or be brought in to the Bomaa, The Bomaa, about ten feet square, is in the inner chamber. It has a special hole about five inches in diameter where messages from the Obosom Tigare are received. This is the sacred spot where clients make their requests. 3-5 Apayee (communicating with Obosom Tigare) Akan Apayee is the method by which the Akan communicate with their spiritual beings, and the linguist (Okyeame) is the only person who is permitted to address the spiritual agencies. In addressing the Abosom, the Okyeame stands up in the same manner as subordinates address their elders. The traditional Apayee \"standing position\" implies that human beings acknowledge Obosom Tigare as the one to whom it is addressed. 9] In Apayee, the liquor is poured into a tumbler three times before the \"roll call'. The \"roll call\" announces the name of all the spiritual agencies in the locality. But Twereduampong and Asase Yaa are not confined and \"petition\" are stated. The petition deals with human needs and desires which the Akan believe cannot be obtained by human effort. The people need to seek and receive blessing from a higher level. In Apayee the Akan believe that success in life lies outside the control of human ego and reason. The Akan perceive themselves as dependent on higher powers and acknowledge that their well being is in the hands of those powers. The Akan approach Obosom Tigare in order to receive critical guidance and support and to avoid negative or disastrous outcomes. Apayee does not necessary take the form of a simple petition as outlined above. There are all kinds of ways of asking for something, and each Obosom in Akan society has its own protocol and effective propitiation, such as self-accusation, flattery, vows, conciliation and mediation. Some Akan words mean, \"ask\"; others mean \"seek\", or \"long for\", spoken in a high or low tones. Different Abosom have different expectations and standards. Apayee is not just a form of communication but an act of humility and is clearly evident 92 in the way the Okyeame comports himself. He lowers his cloth to the waist with bare-chest and raises his head first up to the sky to acknowledge the supremacy of and gratitude to Onyame, and then bows down to demonstrate the Akan deepest respect for the Asase, and the Abosom. The crowd's participation is the form shouts Wie, \"Yes\", at each pause and pronounces Mo ne kasa, \"well spoken!\" at the end of the Apayee. All these signs demonstrate the amount of respect the Akan have for their Abosom. Giving is a critical part of Apayee. The indigenous' view is that the more human beings give, the more Obosom Tigare gives. Also, the more human beings have received from the Abosom, the more they must give. According to the Akan, \"giving\" allows the stream to flow. The moment the giving runs uninterruptedly from donor to recipient or from receiver to giver, more and more blessings abound (Gerrdus van der Leeuw 1963: 351). In Bediako's view (1995: 224), the nature and formulae of Apayee resemble the Christian concept of prayer as a way of addressing supernatural beings, either asking for favours or thanking them for past blessings. Also, both can be offered either on behalf of a particular person or on behalf of a whole community. Mbiti, on the other hand, holds the view that Apayee differs from the Christian concept of prayer. In his view, unlike Christian prayer, Apayee addresses Twereduampong, Asase Yaa, Nananom Nsamanfo, and Abosom aduasa, whereas in Christian prayer they are never mentioned. The only person addressed is the Supreme Being (Mbiti 1975: 64). In traditional Apayee, \"liquor\" is the \"active ingredient\". Without it the ritual is worthless. Apayee always states: Yennfre mo, bere a yemma mo hwee; Mmo megye nsa nom, 93 \"We cannot call upon you without giving you something and so, receive wine and drink\". This element is not found in Christian prayers. Another contrast, is the \"roll-call' where the names of Abosom, Asase Yaa, Nananom-nsamanfo and many more, are mentioned. Though it does not always follow the exact same order, the same names are mentioned. Such names are completely left out of Christian prayer. The major similarity is that both invocations are used as rites of blessing, such as on starting a business venture, on sojourning at a distance, or on thanksgiving for safe return home from a journey. Apayee, however, has experienced cultural changes, particularly in the use of \"liquor''. In the past the Akan say that water and palm wine were the only elements used in Apayee. The use of Dutch Aromatic schnapps in Apayee seems to be something new. Most of the Akan Akomfo interviewed admitted that schnapps were never used in the ritual. Obosom Kwaku Firi of Nwoase still uses palmwine (Nsafufuo) instead of foreign liquor, It is difficult to determine when the Aromatic Schnapps became part of Ghana's traditional culture. According to some historians it was the Dutch who introduced it into the Akan culture when ships arrived on the Gold Coast more than four hundred years ago. It is reported that they presented it to local chiefs during festivals and celebrations (Brookman- Amissah 1999: 12). Today, Nsuo (water) and Nsafufu (palmwine) are used only for removing an oath or curse. In this aspect, some Akan still maintain that foreign liquor is not appropriate as indicated in this axiom: Ede a, yede nsuo ye no, ye de nsa ye nye yie (what water is used for, one cannot substitute with wine). Yet liquor continues to dominate in all rituals and important ceremonies which are performed in Ghana. 94 3-6 Time and Space In the Akan thinking \"time\" is not something empirically given in the world to be laid out and measured. At first this may seem strange, but we must comprehend this idea if we are to be able to understand the freedom the Akan have to create their own experience of time by ways 1n which they structure their lives. At a funeral in Nsiakrom I observed a live cock tied to a hoe- handle in front of a deceased person's house and upon inquiry was told this was to remind him to get prepared to go to his farm. The cockcrow symbolises time. It is the first cockcrow that farmers rise up to, when they go to their farms and it is on the first cock crow that Akan dirge- singers begin their solemn callings on the ancestors/ancestresses to arise and come to their homesteads to visit the living. It is also at the first cock crow that new priests being initiated into Obosom Tigare's priesthood are brought to Okomfo Afua Nsiah for counselling. It is believed that the cock crows only upon seeing the first streak of light and warns humans that the daylight (Anopa) has dawned over night (Anadwo). The morning hours (Anopa) begin from 4 A.M. to 11 A. M., when there are practically no shadows. Night hours (Anadwo) start from 6 P. M., till 4 A.M. The hours between 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. are called mid-night (Awia). People who want to consult Obosom Tigare take their seats in the morning (Anopa). Awia and Anadwo are contrasted in several respects. Awia is the time for public activities whilst Anadwo is associated with private affairs and shady behaviour such as stealing, adultery, and witchcraft. Anadwo is also the time for spirits to begin their activities and so people moving around are warned to be cautious else they are likely to meet these spirits and bring some adversity upon themselves. By contrast, Anopa (morning) is believed to be the best time to consult Obosom 95 Tigare and to perform rituals, as the spirits are best disposed at this time. Awia (mid-day) hours are the worst time to approach Obosom Tigare. Except under the influence of the Western world, there is no such thing as \"clock time\". The Akan reckon time after events in their daily life. The Akan reckon Nnawotwe (eight days) in one week, and measure time from Akwasidae festival to Awukudae festival. The Akwasidae and Awukudae are festivals in honour of the Akan natural deities (Fisher 1998: 22). The Akwasidae falls on Sunday and the Awukudae on Wednesday. And if Awukudae falls this Wednesday, the Sunday beginning the following third week 1s Akwasidae. Seventeen days after Akwasidae is Awukudae. On the eve of an Akwasidae the talking drums announce to the people that the Addae falls on the following day. The stool treasurer (Nkonwua-hwesofo) and the stool carriers (Nkonguasofo) would already have secured the sheep and drink that would be needed. Early in the morning the beating of the drums are repeated and about ten o'clock in the morning the elders and some patients in Nsiakrom come to pay homage to Okomfo Nsiah. After some time, they will all come to the Abosom Danmu (House of Abosom). On entering, people take off their sandals and bare their shoulders as a sign of respect to the Abosom that are believed to be present in the room. Then drinks and meat from a sheep slaughtered there are offered to the Abosom. Placing a piece of meat on each Obosom, Okomfo Nsiah Mmo mmra megye nsa nom, Come, receive, wine and drink, 96 Momma ayarefo nyinaa ayaresa, Let all patients get healed, Momma aboninni nwo maa dausa, Let all barren bear thirty children, Momma kuroma nyinaa nya sika, May all the people of the village get money, Yen nyinaa nkwa so, Long Life to us all. Then she takes a bottle of rum, pours some into a glass, letting a few drops fall on each Obosom. During the Akwasidae Okomfo Afua Nsiah avoids consultations, divination, and healing. It 1s believed that 7igare will turn out badly if undertaken. Rather discussion on any important matter in the village takes place after the ritual. Sacrifices are sometimes made on Fridays which is a Da-bone \"holy-day\" or \"sacred day\" In Akan cosmology, Mmusuo (evil) is first of all to be avoided. The Obosom Tigare keeps its adherents from Mmusuo by telling them what not to do, as in the Ten commandments of the Bible and the Five Precepts of Buddhism. Any breach of these rules carries a definite fine and punishment. During my fieldwork I interviewed several culprits who had been caught for various offences. To guard and direct the life and conduct of the cult's devotees, Obosom Tigare outlined the following commandments: 97 . yi a, to obiara twene. thou shalt throw away any dangerous juju (magic) three days after enrolment in the cult). Emmo obiara apoo, (Thou shall not defraud any person). . Se wodi Obosom Tigare a, won ni ho kwan so wo befa obi yere. Se wo ye saa @, Obosom bekye wo. (Members of Obosom Tigare are forbidden to take their friend's wife/husband. If one does, and Tigare catches the one, he/she would be charged (25,000.00 cedis). . Se wo di Obosom Tigare a, won nni ho kwan se wo be bo obi bayie. Se woto mmera yi a Tigare begye wo dwane. (Members of Tigare are forbidden to tell a friend that he/she is a witch. If one does, Tigare will charge one sheep). . Se wo di Obosom Tigar a, wo nni ho kwan se, wo befa wo yonko adee. Se wo to mmera yi a, Tigare begye wo nantwie. (Members of Tigare are forbidden to steal a friend's goods, if one does, and Tigare catches him/her, he/she would be charged one how, which is 8,000.00 cedis for the person from whom the goods were stolen. Also Tigare members would charge you one sheep, whichis fifty thousand cedis). . Se wo di Obosom Tigare a, wo nni kwan se wo bedi Obosom biara. Se wo to mmera a, wo gye wo Buroni nsa.(Members of Tigare are forbidden to order any Abosom to kill a friend, or any medicine to kill a friend [i.e., practice evil magic]. If one does, 98 one would pay a fine of ten cows and a bottle of Gin). 7. Empo wo Maame ne wo Papa aduane. Se wo ye saa a, eye mmusuo. (It is a taboo for one to refuse his/her parents food. If one does Tigare would catch the one. This is what we call Sipe. [One should not think evil or hold up grudges]. 8... Di wo Agya ne wo na ni. Honor our your father and you mother). 9. Se wo ba Bosom yi so a, wo mmfa duku nkyekye ne ti. Se wo to mmera yi a, yegye dwan. (Coming to Tigare's shrine, one is forbidden to enter with headkerchief, or native sandals. Refusal attracts a fine of one sheep which is five thousand cedis). 10. Se Obosom Tigare foro wo a, mpopo wo ti. Se wo ye saa a, woato mmera. (Should Tigare possess someone, there should be no refusal. A fine could be imposed. 11. Nni Obosom foforo biara nka Tigare ho. Se wo ye saa a, woato mmera. (Thou shalt not have a strange seer before Tigare. It is a taboo). 12. Mmfa Obosom Tigare nni Se woye saa a, wo mmera. (Thou shalt not take the name of Tigare in vain, it is a taboo). 13. Di wo agya ne wo nna ni. Se wo to mmera yi a, ye gye wo Akoko (Honour your father and mother. Failure attracts a fine of one fowl which is four thousand cedis). 14. Nni awu da.

Se wo to mmera yi a, Tigare bekye wo. 99 (Thou shall not steal a friend's goods Tigare will catch the one at once). 16. De ehia kese baako ne se, nni adanse wia, (One of the most important of the laws in Tigare is, thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbour). These rules are recited to the applicant, and if he/she wishes to abide by them he/she pays the priestess an amount varying from five hundred to one thousand cedis, depending on the priestess and the ability of the initiate to pay. Eating a kola nut that has been sanctified by the priestess concludes the ritual. The demand of the cult is authoritative and it aims at controlling the whole life of its adherents and the village where it is set up. The motto of the cult is avoidance of evil practices (Adubone). This is instilled in the hearts and minds of all devotees. Adherents are not to cherish malice against others, neither should they speak ill of others nor nurse rancour in their hearts. Quarrelling and malicious feelings are forbidden and if rancour is concealed in a worshipper's heart, he/she will fall sick and die unless he/she confesses his/her sin. All are expected to live in harmony with their neighbours and learn to be their neighbour's keepers. A visit to Nsiakrom, especially during the healing session and the annual festival, reveals the true character of reciprocity that directs the conduct and life of the people. Apart from the seventeen outlined bylaws, the cult uses informal sanctions against the deviants. These range from ridicule and gossip to ostracism. Scarcely do people resort to physical punishment. They believe and accept that vengeance lies with Obosom Tigare. In practice I noticed that the ex-culprits who remained in the community found it easier to 100 integrate and return to the confirming society than did people sent to mental hospitals. For once an individual confesses in public and undergoes the necessary ritual, religious and social redresses are made, and the person is accepted back into the community and helped to restore his/her lost image. Through this corporate and concerted action of the village, especially the family, the anxious and disappointed are encouraged and helped through the common belief that what affects one affects all. The people in the village find modern reformatory institutions such as prisons, delinquent homes, and mental hospitals inadequate for their needs. They feel that such institutions are places where the worst forms of criminal and deviant behaviours are in fact learned. Therefore they are suspicious of those who return from there. The devotees at the Obosom Tigare cult in Nsiakrom say Aduroye, meaning that the cult is good at solving all their earthly, physical, emotional, domestic, financial, and social problems. But they are quick to add that this is only possible for those who keep clean hearts and minds. They allow room for failure, explaining that a stronger medicine may be at work or that a particular problem is simply the act or will of Onyame, or is attributable to personal destiny. Christians argue that the moral codes the Akan and Obosom Tigare is copied from Christianity. But the Asantehene has refuted this when he states: We know Onyame (God) already ourselves.... As to the commandments of God, we know that we keep them all. We keep the first through our Abosom (fetishes). In Ashanti we do not allow people to abuse the name of Onyame. As to the keeping of the Sabbath we have already kept it. Ifa man Steals we kill him, as the British killed a man in Kumasi for 101 stealing. Ifa man takes the wife of another we kill him. Ifa man commits murder we kill him too. But we will never embrace your religion for it is your religion. It is your religion that has ruined the Fanti people, weakening their power, and brought down the high man on a level with the low man (Dickson 1977: 19). The king's statement represents the general view that Christian ideas are either in conflict with Akan beliefs or are redundant and the latter have not, nor will not, copy from them. 102 Chapter 4 The Obosom Tigare Family 4-1 The Obosomdan (shrine) This chapter examines the nature of the Obosom Tigare family and the role of each Obosom. It then further examines the people who serve in the shrine and their impact on the community. The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate how Obosom Tigare shares in the life of the community. The Abosom in Akan land who reside in houses known as Abosomdan. The Abosomdan comes from and Dan \"a room\". That is, a house for the deity. In this sense, Obosomdan can be translated literally as meaning \"'a temple\" or \"a cathedral\". But Obosomdan in the traditional Akan religion is neither a temple nor a cathedral. As Zahan has pointed out: \"The traditional African religion is characterized by an almost complete absence of temples erected for the purpose of providing shelter for the priests and the members\" (Zahan 1979: 18). One reason the Akan do not have temples or cathedrals is because climatic conditions are not suitable for many people gathering in enclosed spaces. The temperature of Akanland is sometimes more than 80 degrees F. with high humidity (Fordham 1965: 23). The second reason is the traditional medicine man's concern for preserving his secret arts which prohibits public participation. The Akan religion has rules of \"protection\" against the transmission of medical knowledge and practice. One method of protection is that healers will reveal information only to those who are initiated. Those who are uninitiated are not qualified by 103 traditional medical law to have knowledge of traditional practices. Another method of protection is that money must be paid for learning the secrets. The Akan believe that a medicine for which no professional fees are paid is not a medicine. In the Akan community it is mandatory for a father to take money from his son before he imparts medical knowledge. Should the son have no money to pay, the father makes a gift of money to the son who then gives the money to the father as the price of the recipe. The Akan believe that the payment of the professional fee adds a value to the medicine (Simons 1989, May 16). The Obosomdan (pl.) in the past referred to \"sacred holes\", \"rivers\", \"rocks\", or \"mountains\" where Abosom and Nsamanfo first appeared to human beings. Human beings then later erected altars or shrine on these sacred spots. The purpose of these shrines is to remind them of the sacredness of the place and also to demonstrate that all spaces do not have the same values and meanings. In Akan culture the erection of a shrine is equivalent to the founding of a world (See Eliade 1959: 27). For these sacred sites have become towns, villages, hospitals, and many other constructions. The town Asunmenya in the Ashanti region of Ghana is a site where Oyoko ancestors descended from the skies (heaven) in a large brass-pan suspended by a strong Sika- atweaban (gold chain). Similarly, the Kumasi regional hospital is the site where Okomfo Anokye planted his \"sacred sword of life\". Every Obosomdan has two gates, the \"east\" and \"west\". The west gate is a public gate used for daily comings and goings and the east gate is reserved for the Abosom and Nsamanfo. The members who want to consult the Obomsom stay at \"east\" gate. The \"west\" gate is opened but no one is allowed to pass there. 104 The Obosom Tigare's Obosomdan is spacious enough to accommodate ten or fifteen people, but only the Okomfo Afua Nsiah and her attendants enter it. The rest of the members wait in front of it to receive their blessings and redeem their pledges. The members are not permitted to see ritual materials and emblems. To come into the precinct of the shrine, one has to remove his/her shoes or sandals to avoid defilement. The Obosomdan has Abosomdan-asomfo, which is literally translated as \"shrine- servers\". The Abosom-asomfo were originally community criminals who had been handed over by their communities to the Abosom for rehabilitation. But in the recent times, they are freed people who have voluntarily dedicated their lives to the services of some particular shrines. These Abosomdan-asomfo are mostly women who are employed to look after domestic duties. They look after daily activities such as cooking, washing, keeping the place tidy, and run some errands. They are not specifically concerned with the professional activities at the shrine. Rather they are concerned with taboos and all the things, which are to be avoided at the shrine by both priests/priestesses and their trainees. Because of the difficulty involved in remembering all these Akyiwadie \"avoidance\", the Abosom-asomfo wear special little bracelets on their left wrists called Nkae, which is a means to encourage \"remembrance\". Both male and female are eligible to become members, and any member from any clan can be recruited. Because of the nature of their work, some investigators hold the view that certain people become shrine-servers for economic reasons (Idika 1983: 23). There is no doubt that an economic aspect is not absent in their service. It is true that they eat from daily offerings made to the Obosom Tigare and receive gifts such as yams, cocoyam, fowls and palm oil. Also, 105 they enter the Obosomdan at any time of sacrifice and whatever is left in the shrine they eat it freely. No other members of the shrine have these privileges. Yet, it is too simplistic to say, \"they are there just for economic reasons\". They are dedicated and voluntarily run special errands for the deity as well as cultivate farms around the Abosomdan and prevent outsiders from coming into contact with the cult. ] voluntarily became an Abosomdan-asomfo. As a member, I was able to enter and exit the shrine at anytime of the day. As such I had opportunity to hold conversations with clients as often as I wished and went out to towns and villages in Asante Akim district to deliver messages to other personalities. The Obomsomdan in Nsiakrom does not look any different from other buildings. It is made of baked bricks and plastered with sand and cement, and appears like a modern swishwall. Though in the past, the Abosom did not have permanent settlements, at the present time almost all the Abosom in the Akan land have permanent abodes. As Okomfo Afua Nsiah puts it: We have reached a stage that the Abosom should come and dwell in our abodes, to be part and parcel of our lives. They should act as presidents of our domestic lives and act as chiefs and directors of our villages. This permanent place of abode makes it easier and less costly for clients who want to seek protection and guidance from the deity. It is believed that the Obosomdan should not have an elaborate architectural design, but have a simple traditional decoration that reminds people that it is a cult (See Goody 1975: 94). The Obosomdan at Nsiakrom stands as a \"thing of pride\" both for the town and for the deity As the result of years of planning, work, and considerable monetary expense, the shrine is 106 the villagers' offering to the Obosom T. igare in the hope that she will respond by sending down blessings upon them. It is a visible reminder of the covenant between the villagers and their Obosom. People may come to the shrine to receive advice from the Obosom Tigare about their sufferings and ailments. 4-2 Obosom Tigare's Abusua (family) The name Obosom Tigare is a generic name that represents nine Abosom who occupy the shrine. question that many anthropologists and other social scientists have asked is \"how does an Obosom reproduce?\" Does it give birth, or raise a family as human beings do? Scholars such as Rattary, Warren, and Okomfo Afua Nsiah, have offered some answers. According to Rattary \"Obosom gives birth to other Obosom'\". In his view, aS a woman gives birth to a child, in the same manner an Obosom can give birth to other Obosom. Rattary in the Brong Ahafo region (Rattaray 1923a: 126). Warren shares the same view but is more precise on the issue than Rattaray. In his research on Traditional Medicine in the Techiman Bono area, he concludes: \"there are gods who have 'fathered' young gods by giving birth to them as they are addressed as 'mothers' by their devotees, because they are said to care for them like mothers\" (Warren 1975), However, Okomfo Afua Nsiah does not agree with these observations. She says that their views do not reflect the African cosmology and are couched in an inappropriate language or metaphors. In the African cosmology the Abosom are not thought of as biological beings and do 107 not \"give birth\". To say that the \"4bosom are born\" would mean they are biological beings who have \"beginning\" and definitely have \" ending\". But the Abosom have neither beginning nor ending. In her view, the Abosom build their families through the care and hospitality the Akomfo and the clients give to them. For example, if an Okomfo takes good care of his/her Obosom, this hospitality encourages other 4bosom somewhere to come and join the family. Through this means a large family is built. If, on the other hand, they are not properly cared for, they leave their families and find another partner. She concludes that it is how human beings relate to them that determines whether an Obosom should stay or leave. Each Obosom manifests itself in spirit possession and performs a specific role. The first on the roll is Obosom Adama. The Obosom Adama is a 6\" x 9\" earthenware pot placed at the right hand corner of the Obosomdan. The earthenware contains Kukuo (pot), Kora (calabash), Aporiba, (club) from north. The Obosom Adama shrine's ritual object includes Akuaba (a small wooden effigy) carved as a human, with a head, arms, legs and feet. The Akuaba's forehead and the neck have beautiful indentations. This is an especially revered object and is used only on special occasions. On such occasions the Okomfo Afua Nsiah puts on a blackened Batakari (smock) and a long pointed hat. The power-source of the Adama is the mixture of roots and vegetable matter in the clay pot. Usually an accused witch drinks from this in order to prove his/her innocence. The Obosom Adama is consulted in order to verify the presence of witchcraft. In all such cases a number of chickens are sacrificed at the shrine. If they fall Ayaya (on their backs), innocence is proven but if they fall Butu (on their breasts), is implied guilt. The clients consult 108 Obosom Adama on matters regarding the outcome of communal labour projects, celebrations of some sorts, funerals, and the safe delivery of children. Others consult for the purpose of gaining advice concerning travelling overseas, business ventures, lost or stolen articles, or some impending danger. When the clients come to Obosom Adama shrine the Okomfo Afua Nsia receives kola nuts and a small amount of money from them. Then she splits the cola and listens closely to the clients' requests. After that she recites a formal prayer and then asks Obosom Adama a question and casts the split kola nuts to receive an answer. The question is always answerable in terms of the binary pole \"yes\" or \"no\", \"accept\" or \"not accept\". If one of the halves of the nut falls \"inside-down\" while the other \"inside-up\", the question is repeated or rephrased. Contradictory answers are always double-checked and the veracity of an entire sequence is often re-examined. The second is Obosom Nantee. It is believed that Nantee (\"traveller) Abosom Tigare. Nantee is a two-foot missile-shaped log smeared with animal blood. It rests ona Bukyia (three legged metal stand) which contains Yawa (a brass basin), so blackened that the actual material is indistinguishable. This Yawa is filled to the brim of unidentified substances. They look like pieces of bones, cowries, and beads. Across the Yawa are numerous short stakes blackened from the blood of animal sacrifices and eggshells. The role of Obosom Nantee is to help those who have lost articles or items to retrieve them. It uses sixteen Sedee (cowries) by tossing fifteen or fourteen in the right hand and leaves one or two in the left. If two nuts remain, a single mark is made on the divining tray, if one nut remains a double mark is made. The Okomfo Afua Nsiah repeats this procedure four times, which gives sixteen basic 109 figures, Each procedure affords a specific interpretation. The chain is employed in the middle so that four half seed shells fall in line on each side. Each half shell may fall either on the head or the tail. That is, it may fall with its concave inner surface upward, which is equivalent to a double mark on the tray. According to my observation, the Nantee's divination principle proceeds from \"known\" to \"unknown\". That is, the client provides Abisadee (a consultation fee), and then whispers the subject matter for investigation. The investigation usually takes this form: \"Qh! You Nantee who knows everything (omniscience) I ask nothing but that you reveal the identity of the person (for example) who stole my gold chain (or whatever the offence may be)\"' After the whisper the Abisafo places the fee on the divining tray, then Okomfo Afua Nsiah casts the chain over the fee and finds the subject matter under investi gation. She sways the chain to the right hand, to the left, then to the back and to the front, like a pendulum. Finally she grabs it in the middle with the right hand and lets it fall freely on the tray. Through this method she identifies the culprit. When she arrives at a conclusion, Okomfo Afua Nsiah communicates the message to the client. The third Obosom of the family is Oheneba, who is presumed to be the son of T. igare. Its altar is about 8 foot square in a human shape that stands at the centre of the shrine. It has a beautiful neck and broad shoulders. The back is round with a slight buttock. It has several bri ght red and yellow vertical stripes from the head to the toes. But the whole body is white. On festive days it receives palm oil and eggs each morning. 110 The Obosom Ohenaba has a small enclosure and is separated from the rest of the family by a white screen made of gray baft material. Inside the screen, there is a large pot filled with herbs and other magical objects, which Oheneba uses to conducts her investigations. The Obosom Oheneba has its own method and procedures of divination. During consultation each client takes Kora (a calabash) and puts in his/her consultation fee. Then Okomfo Afua Nsiah receives their requests and invokes the deity to act on the client's behalf. Oheneba's invocation consists of recitations and incantations punctuated by the ringing ofa bell. The tempo then increases as she chants the incantations, and calls upon Oheneba to come in. After some minutes there is an unusual voice behind a calico screen, in a shrill and nasal tone, believed to be Oheneba who has responded to the call. It is then that the Obosom Oheneba unfolds the findings of the case before her. The Obosom Oheneba's message does not seem to be audible to her clients unless the Okyeame explains it. It is only the Okomfo Afua Nsiah and the Okyeame who understands when it speaks. Sometimes the priestess follows a \"question and answer\" procedure to identify culprits. The next Obosom is known as Gyinaye whose altar stands at the rear of Oheneba. The Obosom Gyinaye appears to be rough and unfinished clay. It is so broad that its vertical strokes can be seen down the face. It has a white pointed crest at the forehead. In front of its altar are always blood, palm oil, and mashed yam. Gyinaye's main concern is female protection, particularly mothers who have lost several children. She affords health and protection to the child so that he/she might not be taken from its mother. It is believed that it is Gyinaye who gave protection to Okomfo Afua Nsiah and her family in the early stage of her life. Gyinaye claims to 111 be the senior of all the Abosom in the family and binds all of them to herself. The mothers who bring their children to Obosom Gyinaye usually lay them upon a palm broom and tribal marks are made on their left cheeks with medicinal herbs. After that they are given a herbal bath. Sometimes women/men who are suspected of witchcraft come to Obosom Gyinaye to prove their innocence. I witnessed a case of a woman from Osei's \"house\" who had married out and who, after her husband died, was suspected of witchcraft by her husband's brother. She rushed on her own to Gyinaye in order to prove her innocence. A young girl was \"caught\" rather than the old woman who then went back with witnesses to her husband's brothers announcing that she had been proven innocence by Gyinaye. In this way she put a stop to any further accusations. The two cases I witnessed show that in many respects the clients themselves played important roles in the settlements. In each case the Obosom allowed them ample time to settle and work out their differences. When they have settled their differences and come back, Obosom Gyinaye does not \"demand\" anything from them. The reason why clients admire Gyinaye is not so much in the giving of oracles but in its \"insistence\" that both the \"accused\" and \"accuser\" live in peace and harmony. An another important Obosom in the Tigare's family is Ayira. Obosom Ayira is a small round white domed lid. This domed lid contains water mixed with juice extracted from Nsummua leaves. The fragrance of the leaves is believed to drive away evil spirits. It is believed that Ayira travels long distances to punish evildoers in communities. Ayira has a number of clay objects which are round or oval shape, painted in a dark opaque red and purple colour mixed 112 with blood or soot. Each object has white lines that look like a \"cross\" on the dark background. Whenever the name of the Obosom Ayira (vanish) is mentioned, a small hand bell is rung So as to keep the \"spirit\" in its place. I was told that if the bell was not rung, Obosom Ayira would vanish from the shrine. The people who consult Ayira are mostly drivers and hunters. Others include people who want to obtain visas to travel overseas. It is believed that clients use Obosom Ayira to control humans and perform miraculous deeds. One of my informants confirmed the power of Ayira when he said: Ayira helps him to hold an enemy to ransom, render a lion and other wild animals feeble, by making himself invisible in the face of a charging animal by floating on water. It helps him to become immune to cutlasses and knife cuts, and helps to divert the course of bullets away from himself and in another direction. | Another informant's claim is that the charm helps most young men to obtain American and other foreign country visas. The Obosom Ayira even assures those who are denied visas to go and board planes for it helps them to escape immigration officials at checking points. Another Obosom is Afrim. The Obosom Afrim is specifically for the protection and purification of politicians and chiefs. At each Adae festival the Obosom Afrim is taken to the paramount chief of the area and is set upon his thighs to purify him. Next to Afrim is the Obosom Abrantee (young man). The Obosom Abrantee is in the form of the jaw and horns of aram. Others objects include an 18\" long log shaped as a projectile, and numerous, crooked, and knotted sticks. When Abrantee possesses Okomfo Afua Nsiah, she uses these sticks to figure out which Obosom is to come upon her next. Abrantee is believed to be free 113 and can come out and make him/herself known at any time of the day. The Obosom Kwasheiga is two strings of cowries in the form of necklaces, and a perforated stone about two inches in diameter which has been whitened with Hyire (white clay) as well as two Akofona (ceremonial swords) and three Bodua (horsetail switches). The stone is used by the priestess as a \"cell phone\" to communicate with the spirits when she is in a state of possession. There is also a \"crown\" which the carriers use to move it. The Obosom Aberewa is housed at the right side of the entrance to the inner court and is a six-inch squat clay globe, coloured with black and white chalks. Some of the clay globes are egg- shaped, and others are holsters shaped. But all are believed to be Aberewa (old lady), mother of Obosom Tigare. As a mother, all the other Abosom surround her as her children. As Aberewa she sits on a white stool believed to be the power that brews medicine for warriors. When a warrior is bathed in the water scourged from the stool, he/she is rendered secured against gunshot. The Obosom Aberewa is believed to be the earliest cult which emerged and became Established in Asante towns such as Edweso, Juaso and so on, spreading from there into other areas of the country. It is not easy to identify this Obosom Aberewa with the Obosom Aberewa in ligare 's family. The practitioners do not know how it appeared in Obosom Tigare's cult. The Okomfo Afua Nsiah's main interest is not in its origin but in the role it plays in the family. The Obosom Aberewa cures, protects, and gives predictions during wartime. That is to say, the Aberewa serves the military needs of the nation. Sometimes it also helps people to retrieve lost articles. It is the only Obosom who protects the Okomfo Afua Nsiah and all other sacred of leaders in the community. It is the Obosom who receives the majority of the clients because of 114 her wisdom and experience in dealing with sensitive issues. It is believed that the Obosom Aberewa always accompanies Okomfo Afua Nsiah. Also, when the paramount chief is ill or troubled, he must come to Obosom Aberewa in Nsiakrom personally to find strength and solace. Though from \"inside\" it appears each Obosom in the family has an individual role to play, from the \"outside\" people see each as part of a large whole upon whom the local chiefs, and politicians, all depend. 4-3 Afodee (sacrifice) The Akan word for sacrifice is religion, means \"something used to soften or wet something or in other words, something used to cool down the heart of a spiritual being. Similar meaning is perhaps found in the Yoruba religion. The Yoruba word for sacrifice is Etutu. Etutu means to dip hot iron into cold water to cool it (Adewale 1988: 60). A clear example of sacrifice in this sense is the case of Decius Mus of ancient Rome who is said to have offered himself to the gods for the city in order to gain victory (Bourdillon 1980: 28). Tweneboakodua from Kumawu of the Ashanti Region of Ghana offered himself as sacrificial victim during the Ashanti and Denkyira war after the renowned priest Okomfo Anokye predicted that the former would lose unless someone gave himself up to the Abosom. As gratitude for this offer, the Ashanti placed him on the Talking Drum to commemorate his bold patriotism. The Akan concept of Afodee is that \"one person should die in order that the entire community may live\". This noble task contradicts at least the observers' theories which say, 115 \"human sacrifice is certainly a method of social control in Ashanti\" (Jay 1992: 66). Wilks has quoted of the Asante king saying: \"If I were to abolish human sacrifice, I should deprive myself of one of the most effectual means of keeping the people in subjection\" (Wilks 1975: 594). I think these observers linked the Asante king to the kings of Benin and Dahomey where a British Surgeon reported that human sacrifice was the major defensive strategy. This has no parallel in the Akan land. In Afodee, the victim is not just offered to appease the Abosom or Nsamanfo, but rather the victim represents the entire community and carries their petitions and pleas to a higher power. In other words, he/she acts as an ambassador who is expected to plead on behalf of those who sent him/her (Bourdillon 1980: 22). The basic purpose of Afodee in Akan religion is right relationship between human beings and that of the deity. The Akan Afodee and that of Yoruba meet an urgent need, the maintenance or restoration of relationship. As Farrow rightly observes \"The supreme importance of Yoruba sacrifice is to restore relationship between a man and his deity\" (Farrow 1926: 98). The way the Akan attach meaning to Afodee is the same the way they treat human beings and how they treat their Abusua payin (family head) or Ohene (a chief). In Akan society, if someone shows good will, one must appreciate it. It is in the same manner that Akan offer gifts to the Abosom. The Akan offer gifts to Obosom Tigare in appreciation of success in business enterprise or in giving birth to a child. The market women who sell well during the week bring their gifts. Other women who are blessed with children do the same. Government officials who have received promotions bring in gifts. All these people thank the Obosom Tigare for their 116 special blessings. The Akan abhor ingratitude in all aspects of their lives. They believe that one must return something to any one who helps them in one way or another. It is a grievous mistake not to return thanks. The Akan express it as, Mato mase, which means, \"I have offered salt, but I have been paid back with pepper\". The Akan sense of gratitude is clearly demonstrated in dealings with the Obosom T igare. The clients who refuse to give back thanks to Obosom Tigare are accused of being ungrateful and are ostracised. There are many things Akan offer as Afodee, ranging from cash, food products, clothes, animals, to alcoholic beverages. But every Afodee takes the Obosom's Akyiwadiee (taboos) into consideration. The Akan word Kyi means to abhor or hate. These are the things that offend the Abosom, such as certain foods or drinks (which the Akan call Adee a yekyi). But what is Akyiwadie (taboos) to one divinity may not be a taboo to another. While Obosom T igare does not drink Nsafufuo (palm wine) for instance, it is the favourite drink of Obosom Tano. In the case of the former, liquor should not be taken near the shrine and her clients are forbidden to drink when approaching the cult for consultations. The rules also apply to victims of animal sacrifice. In food or drink the Abosom eat some parts and the worshippers eat the rest. In the same manner of animal sacrifice, the priest/priestess eats certain parts and the cultic functionaries also eat certain parts of the ram. In Obosom Tigare's cult, Okomfo Afua Nsiah eats the heart \"to her to vision\". The Okyeame receives the thorax and windpine \"to help him to make talk\". The stool bearer receives the head, all except the lower jaw, \"to strengthen his head for carrying the stool\". The horn blower receives the lower jaw. The heralds receive the lungs. The assistants 117 receive legs. These parts are treated with medicine to them effective (plate # 5). In some other Abosom the hearts of other animals help for divination. The part of the animal that is reserved for the Obosom's is placed on the shrine for a couple of hours. After that period the worshippers remove it. The Akan, like the Bantu people of east Africa, believe that the Abosom only consume the \"essence\" and leave out the \"accidents\" (Placide Temples 1969: 51). The Obosom Tigare has seven kinds of Afodee. People offer sacrifice depending upon the circumstance and the condition. The first is called Aduane-Afodee (meal offering). This is commonly offered almost every day but particularly on sacred days and other festivals. In this kind of sacrifice, the meal is offered to Obososm T igare, then a portion is shared among the worshippers. It is usually a communion meal between the worshippers and the Obosom. This kind of sacrifice maintains close contact with the Obosom (Beattie 1980: 38). The second sacrifice is Aseda-afodee (thank-offering). The thank-offering is an appreciation of blessing and prosperity for which the divinity is thanked. The offering may be an ornamental article for the shrine, a bird, or animal, fruits or vegetables. Usually this is given over to the divinity, although people will share an animal or a bird with the divinity. It is a sacrifice for an increase in input. The third is Aboadee-afodee (votive offering) It is a promise to give the divinity something if help is rendered. The offering may be made at any time as occasion warrants. The annual festival is the usual period for the payment of the vows. The fourth is Sraha-afodee (propitiatory offering) which is a sacrifice of appeasement. Usually it is Obosom Tigare who prescribes it. It is to assuage her anger or wrath. Whenever there is misfortune of any kind the worshippers consult the Obosom Tigare who tells them the kind of spirit that is provoked and to 118 which spirit the worshipper has to offer sacrifice. When this sacrifice is on the individual level it is simple and inexpensive, but when it is on community level it is elaborate and expensive. The fifth Asinam-afodee (substitutionary offering) is to alter an agreement. A little explanation is necessary. The Akan believe that there are companies of \"wandering spirits\" of children who enter into pregnant women to be born and to die for sheer relish of mischief These children are believed to have signed agreements with their \"companions\". Also, it is believed the child will \"return\" if an appropriate sacrifice is not offered. The Obosom T. igare, therefore, prescribes a sacrifice as a substitute to prevent the person from being taken away by his/her \"companions\". In this case an animal life has to be substituted for the human. The animal the Akan offer for this kind of sacrifice is a ram. The ram is treated as corpse and buried with certain rites in substitution for the suppliant. Sometimes, something of value of the person is buried along with the ram (Marcel Griaule 1976: 51). The sixth is called Ahosan-afodee (preventive sacrifice). This is either a precaution to guard a town or village or to protect an individual. It is a means of warding off dangers like an epidemic or to ensure that at all times people are protected. In preventive sacrifice it is the oracle that prescribes what is to be sacrificed. The animal victim of this sacrifice may be killed and offered up in the ordinary way; but more often than not, it is buried at the entrance to the town, village, compound, or house. In certain cases, the offering is not an animal, but cash or an article. The oracle prescribes, for example, that each person in the community should rub his/her body all over with the article or coin, and drop it at a given place (Lienhardt 1961 ). The last is Fapim- afodee (foundation sacrifice). Its name implies that the sacrifice is meant for the foundation of a 119 house, village, town or a market to prevent evil powers from entering the place. The Obosom ligare is first consulted to find out what should be done; and when the required guidance has been obtained, then the victims or articles for the sacrifice are taken to the spot where the foundation is to be made and there offered up. It is believed that in the past the victims were actually human beings buried alive at the entrances as sentries. But in the modern times, sheep, cows, or oxen are used instead of human beings. 4-4 Emblems in Obosom Tigare The emblems of Obosom Tigare visually depict the cult's power. The emblems are of different categories. The first emblem is a gun. Whenever Okomfo Afua Nsiah is possessed she takes a gun in her hand. The Obosom Tigare is classified in the cult as Abosom brafo. The Akan word Abrafo means \"an executioner\". In the past every Akan royal court had Abrafo (executioners) who were responsible for killing war captives. As a symbol of Abosom Tigare, it means it is a cult that never allows \"evil doers\" to go free. As Christensen points out: Obosom Tigare, because of its power to deal ruthlessly with Abayifo, many people have become her members. Even those who are not members participate in Tigare ceremonies. This is because Tigare's deals against evil forces (Christensen 1954:398). The second of the emblems is the image of Opuro (squirrel). In Akan thinking, when an Opuro walks along a path and comes to an intersection, it first halts, stands on the hind legs, raises up the forelegs, and then turns left and right to see whether there is danger. As a symbolic animal, Obosom Tigare is credited with the attributes of foresightedness, perceptivity, and omniscience. 120 Kotoko (porcupine) is also a symbolic animal in Obosom T. igare. By nature, Kotoko has long and large quills and is invulnerable to any animal. It does not only shoot its quills at its attackers but as soon as it shoots one off, another grows in its place. In the Obosom emblem it symbolises the power of Tigare \u2014 that Obosom T igare 's decisions are irrevocable and have the power to vanquish any enemy who seeks to destroy her clients. Etwie (leopard) is another symbolic animal. In the Akan oral tradition, Etwie is \"king\" of all the animals in the forest and so has the title Kantinka (the great one). In official ceremonies, the Okomfo Afua Nsia is the only person who is permitted to sit on Sebo dwa (leopard stool) which symbolises her great power. The Obosom T igare balances \"power\" with \"humility\" by using some domestic animals as its symbols. The first symbolic animal in this category is Akoko. In Akan society Akoko indicates an attribute of the head of the family, which is expressed as Akoko nan tia ne ba, na enkum ba, which means, \"the hen treads on her chicks, but does not kill them\". The symbolic meaning is that though Obosom Tigare punishes harshly, her main motive is to correct human beings but not to destroy them. Another characteristic is Akoko baatan a wo ntakra kata ne mma nyina so, which is literally translated as, \"the mother hen whose feathers cover all her is translated as \"the hen knows that it is dawn, but it leaves the announcement for the rooster\", expresses meekness. This meekness is symbolised on a staff with a hen at the top. It expresses Obosom Tigare 's meekness and tenderness in handling her clients. The Obosom Tigare does not accept a goat as a sacrificial animal because a goat isa 121 resistant animal. The Akan say: Aberekyire se, obi nnante nkowu, which is translated \"A goat says, no one walks willingly to his/her death\". In other words, it is not allowed itself to be slaughtered without the least resistance. Hence it is a taboo to Obosom Tigare. However, Obosom Tigare accepts sheep. In state gatherings Okomfo Afua Nsiah steps on the skin of a ram, which symbolises her docility, peacefulness and humility. The Gyedua is an important ritual plant in Obosom Tigare's cult. It is under this tree that the Okomfo Afua Nsiah sits when she is in a state of possession. All community meetings are also held under it. The Gyedua has a very high capacity for survival and does not shed its leaves in the dry season. Therefore, as regards ritual, it has a great advantage since most other plants Shed leaves in the dry season. When an Okomfo dances under it this symbolises the cult's life and power which constitute the essence of every divinity. 4-5 Obosomwura (custodian of the shrine) It is necessary to modify the impression we have given so far that the head of the family or compound automatically assumes the priestly office. This impression perhaps stems from the Akan old political organisation. In the old Akan political organization the governmental unit is the head of extended family. The head of the group of kinsmen is not only the ruler but performs all the rites of the family Obosom: priest and chief are one. The Obosom may be the genius ofa river, lagoon, or hill, he/she may be totemic animal, but he/she is always regarded as invisible, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. The groups of priests who are heads of families are the joint rulers of the village. One of the Obosom is regarded as the senior and his/her priest/priestess 122 is the high priest/priestess of the town or village. The feature of them that I wish to emphasize is that religious organization is identical with governmental organization. In the case of ancestral cults, this remains invariably so, except as we have observed, where the ancestor has become a divinity. In the case of the Abosom, however, the situation is rather complicated. Fusion of clans, and intermingling of peoples through marriage and acquisition of \"strangers\" have been the major causes of the complication. For example, a woman who comes into a household with her own cult remains the officiant of the shrine because she is Obosomwura, and this line of officiants is continued by her offspring. Also, farm labourer who joins the Akan family sometimes comes with his/her cult. This stranger becomes the Abosomwura since he/she knows his/her object of worship. Again clans that come into fusion bring their own cults and they remain the sole repositories of the cultus, that is, the priest/priestess is chosen from among them. In any one of these cases, whatever might be relative status of the persons or clans within the community, they retain the guardianship of the cults of which they are the Abosomwura-nom \"owners\". If such cult becomes communal property, the whole community still looks to the founder as the Obosomwura for the conduct of their rituals, with the only modification that they now hold the custody and officiate on behalf of the village or town. It is in this way that almost every one of the Akan Abosom is attached to certain lineage \"owners\" to whom its priesthood belongs exclusively. It is here that the hereditary character of Akan traditional priesthood becomes marked, provided we do not take \"hereditary\" in its strict sense. What it means here is that even though a whole village or town claims an Obosom, it may 123 be generally known that a particular family, living in a particular ward of the village or town, has exclusive custody of the cult. Without them nobody has any access to cult. Besides this hereditary character, the Akan priesthood is hierarchical (Asare Opoku 1978: 76). The hierarchical grading varies however from place to place, depending on the age and degree of concentration of the priesthood within particular area. In Nsiakrom, Okomfo Afua Nsiah is Obosomwura and the Okomfopayin (senior priestess). As the Okomfopayin, she trains all the other junior priests/priestesses and also functions at state level, co-ordinating the activities of other priests/priestesses within the Oman (paramountcy). She is assisted by other sub-priests/priestesses. Each member of the cult staff is treated according to his/her status in seating arrangements and in the sharing of emoluments (plate # 6). 4-6 The Role of the Okomfo The role of the Obosomwura is varied. They are defined by the titles by which they are addressed: Odureyefo, Odunsini, Asumankwahene, Okomfo and called Odureyefo. The term Odureyefo isa person who uses herbal medicines to cure sickness. It is the same as Odunsin. The only difference is that Odunsini is nota priest/priestess since he/she does not divine and is not possessed by a deity. Normally, the Odunsini specialises in herbs for the cure of a particular disease. As an aid to her profession, Okomfo Afua Nsiah has Suman as \"black magic\" in Akan religion; it is a generic term applied to objects or mixtures made for the purpose of protection, assistance, or for the punishment of some specific 124 enemy. The Suman guides and helps the Odusini picks effective herbs in the forest or drives away evil powers which impede the progress of curing. These powers may derive from the supernatural beings that activate them or from the compulsive formulas used in making them. In the past, the Adusinifo (pl.) operated in houses and received patients referred by priests/priestesses. But now, perhaps, due to economic hardships, they move from one village to another to seek patients and sell their medicine. In modern times, some Adusinfo combine traditional medicine with western medicine especially drugs manufactured in Europe and North America. Another title for the custodian of Obosom Tigare is Asumankwaahene. The word Asumankwaahene is derived from Suman and Hene (chief). It is a title reserved for the custodian of the paramount chief's shrine and so she is classified as the \"paramount chief's physician\". As the chief's physician, she makes sacrifices on behalf of the Omanhene and the entire community. In times of crises, such as famine or war, she acts as the Omanhene's chief advisor. When the old Suman becomes weak, she travels outside the country to procure much more powerful medicine. It is believed that in times of war, she carries the Suman and leads the Asafo (militarymen). She first predicts the outcome of the war. Should the result be negative, she makes sacrifices to change the course of events. As Asumankwaahene, she is Omanhene's bodyguards and accompanies him when he travels. She prevents anyone in the community who wants to use evil medicine from harming or ruining his reputation. She destroys their medicine and directs them towards their enemies. She prepares the Omanhene 's Dudo (herbal bath) and washes him in it from time to time. 125 The priestess is called Okomfo. An Okom/fo is a medium who serves an Obosom and who may be of either sex. But there are some people who prefer to use the term Okomfo-baa (female priestess) rather than Okomfo-barima (male priests), a term used exclusively for male priests. However, most Akan believe there is no real difference between the two, since both Akomfo and Abosomfo have shrines and perform divinations. They have herbal knowledge and cure both physical and spiritual diseases. Also, the Abosom possess both Akomfo and Abosomfo. Most of the custodians of Obosom Tigare are male with the exception of Okomfo Afua Nsiah. This phenomenon causes some people to think that Abosom are \"sex-biased\". But it appears not to be true. The priests of Obosom Tano are male, but the custodians of Akunnnede shrine are mostly women. The Obosom Ta-Kora priests are predominantly men, but in terms of membership women outnumber men. The reason is probably their Awoo-den (in ability to procreate) problem which brings women closer to the spirits than men. In Akan traditional society, a woman without a child is regarded as worthless. This responsibility for bringing children into the world forces a woman to run to the shrine for help if she does not become pregnant. The Akan generally believe that female priestesses are not effective as men. The Akan attribute the apparent paradox of a deficiency of women in the priesthood given their spiritual advantages to the taboos placed on women during menstruation which restricts their daily tasks and limits their participation in rituals. When there is an important religious meeting and they are required to participate, they may say \"Makyima\", indicating they are menstruating and therefore cannot perform their duties. \"In olden times\", writes Rattray, \"if any menstrous woman entered 126 the room where the stools were kept she would have been killed instantly\" (Rattray 1923: 96). It is believed that even the queen mother cannot enter her own stool house if she is menstruating. According to Fortes it is specifically the menstrual taboo the prevents women from holding political office other than queen mother, since such office requires performing regular stool rituals (Fortes 1963: 68). Men usually take their place. Menstruation also prohibits women from practising divination or contacting the Obosom. Those who break these rules lose their powers. Hence most Abosom prefer Akomfo (priestesses) who have passed their menopause. The idea of marriage presents a special problem to the Akomfo profession. In the initial stage of spirit possession, the woman has to marry the Obosom and this marriage deprives her of sexual intercourse with her human spouse. If, on the other hand, she is unmarried, she remains unmarried for life and this is not a problem. The Akan traditional method and practice of healing also poses a serious threat to women becoming priestesses. The time spent with patients in fulfilling her obligations to her deity will seriously affect her ability to attend her wifely duties. The main function of Abosomwura is to serve an intermediary between his/her community and the Abosom into whose service he/she is called to serve. In a typical priestly capacity, she/he presents the community's needs to the Obosom and interprets the deity wishes to the community. His/her close contact with the spirit world places him/her in an extraordinary position. This earns him/her much respect; and his/her words and action carry much weight in the society. This will be addressed fully in the next section. 127 4-7 The Privileges of Okomfo As a custodian of the shrine Obosom Tigare, Okomfo is moved from the level of Mmmerantewa \"commoners\" and to Mpayinfo \"elders\". She is now on par with men and women who hold chiefly title or who have married into the royal family. Ordinary men, women, and children now kneel and address her with the honorific Ohemaa (queen mother) or Obatan Pa, (sweet mother). The Akan custom does not permit her to kneel before any man, including the Omanhene (paramount chief) of the of Asante Akim. People who meet her must speak to her respectfully; they must not look directly into her eyes, and they must listen attentively to any advice she may give. Asa head of the community, the elders must visit her on weekends and evenings and pay her homage during the Adae festival just like any traditional king. When she goes out on official business, she travels with an entourage, which is a high mark in Akan society. No self-respecting Akan chief or important politician goes out officially without such accompaniment as it demonstrates his capacity to lead and gather people. An Akan expression to describe a situation of utter humiliation is to compare the person to a chief going out without an entourage. As Ohemaa (queen mother), she puts on white wrappers and numerous strands of coral beads around her neck, wrists, and ankles and besmears her whole body with Hyire (white clay). The Hyire symbolises purity and victory. For example, if a widow mourns for a period of time, she first goes to a stream and washes away the defilement caused by death. Then she leaves her clothes at the bank of the river and daubs herself with Hyire before she puts on her new dress. This ritual symbolises that she is victorious over grief. The Hyire in Akan religion symbolises 128 purity and Afua Nsia smears the body with Hyire, it communicates to the community that she is \"sacred\" and nothing \"profane\" should come into contact with her. In every community gathering, she sits on a white stool and is presented with liquor of her own choice. When leaving, it is a custom that the community gives her a gift either of cash or in kind. These are special privileges accorded only to the most senior persons in the Akan community. Whenever she sits, she sits in the centre of the crowd surrounded by people from various social and geographical backgrounds. Any member who wants to talk or participate in any activity, first seeks permission from her. She is also the final arbiter of all community disputes. It is a custom in the Nsiakrom that whenever there is any dispute between two people that the matter first goes to the head of the family. If the head of the family cannot deal with it, it goes to the chief. If the chief cannot settle it, then it comes to Okomfo Afua Nsiah. It is easy for Okomfo Afua Nsiah to settle all disputes simply by commanding, but she does not proceed that way. Her view is that this procedure just stops the fight; it does not heal the wounds. She allows both parties to state their grievances and then allows all the members of the family to participate in the discussions before she draws conclusions. She is in effect the community's counsellor and advisor. She also has the prerogative of granting titles to people. This is an extremely significant political function in Akan society (Kwasi Sarpong 1989: 46). She also has a court with a hierarchy of titleholders who are equally important to those found within royal palaces. And like a chief she receives homage from people in all walks of life. She is also paid handsomely for conducting initiations of new priestesses. The great percentage of her income, she channels into 129 the upkeep of the shrine, the purchase of regalia (costumes, coral beads, and the like), and the acquisition of ritual materials such as animals for sacrifice and food for participants. Part of the revenue she redistributes to the cult servers on the basis of seniority. Her main purpose here is to help people who are in need. As Herbert Lewis points out for male Shoa Galla mediums: His wealth provides the material means to fulfill his functions. This is not to say that a k'allu may not become a rich man, but rather, that the aim, the end that brings esteem and influence is not accumulation alone but successful organisation and manipulation of ritual, judicial, and social activity (Lewis 1970: 178). Beyond their households and religious associations, the Obosom Tigare priestess has official political authority over chiefs, politicians, and the police who consult her whenever they encounter problems. On a wider basis, she uses her financial resources to support community projects, such as schools, hospitals and community centres. She also acts as a cultural broker, setting up contacts between people in Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Nigeria. The priestess visits the king with her entourage on festival days and consults with him on community developments. As a traditional herbalist, she is the midwife to the king's wives and others in the palace. On radio and television, she holds discussions with people on various matters. Sometimes she appears with her dancing group, teaching the meaning and significance of traditional dancing. Most of the dances on the Television are only for entertainment; they are of fixed patterns and must be done correctly. She teaches, for example, which movements of the hands must accompany the body, which turns are taken next, and how many times each component of the pattern is to be repeated \u2014 all these must be carefully observed. This 130 correctness is more than a matter of form; it is not a sacred obligation, but the default may be ruinous to the beauty of the dance. The \"speech\" of the musical instruments is often designed to guide the dancers in their movements. Many people enjoy watching the program which comes on every Saturday evening. 131 Chapter 5 The Okomfo Profession 5-1 Obosom call As we have already observed from the previous chapter, there appears to be no specific \"call\" in the technical sense to the Akan priesthood. Normally the person who succeeds the family priest/priestess in the village is next to him/her in rank. He/she should have been with the priest/priestess and should have \"understudied \" him/her by assisting and watching him/her during the conduct of rituals. Or if the priest/priestess grows old he/she delegates his/her second- in-command to the office. Or when he/she dies, the assistant steps in automatically. But deep down it is a different matter where a devotee is concerned. It is through call. The Akan have three expressions for call. The first is, Akom asi ne so, which is literally translated as \"an Obosom has descended on him/her\". The second is Akom aka no. This is translated as \"an Obosom has mounted him/her\". The third expression is Obosom aforo no, which is translated, \"an Obosom has possessed him/her\". All these expressions point out the fact that Obosom mounts human beings, just as a rider mounts a horse. A devotee is a \"horse\" and the Obosom is the \"rider''. According to Okomfo Afua Nsiah the Obosom descends from the \"other side of the world\" to \"this side of the world\" to meet a specific human needs. This is to warn or remind human beings of their responsibilities, to deal with illness such as infertility, impotency, failure in business finances and to prevent thieves, witches, and evil doers from causing harm to others. 132 Sometimes the \"call\" comes by possession during which the person becomes ecstatic, and then it is believed the Obosom Tigare has taken hold of him/her. This may happen at any time, but often it is during some ceremony connected with cultic dancing. The person may just be standing apart watching, or be dancing as one of the worshippers- when he/she becomes possessed. One of my informants related this experience: On one Sunday, about forty-one years ago, I attended a minor Akom dancing that was staged by the late priest, Mensa. As I was not the Okyeame on that day, I sat somewhere in my working dress for I had then completed the plastering work I was doing on my building with the mason I had engaged. As I sat listening to the music I fell down and rolled on the ground in wild fits of frenzy. I heard the words of the songs; I saw the priest and all those who were watching the dance. But I was unable to control myself as the music went on. I heard Mensa saying, 'this is the man the Obosom has chosen to become the priest'. After a while, I gradually became sober again. Another means by which a person is called to the worship of Obosom Tigare is through a certain declaration of the oracle. This often happens when the customary rite is performed immediately after a child's birth; but a grown-up may be called through a certain outward event in his/her life which the diviner interprets as the work of an Obosom who is claiming him/her. In Akan religion, unlike the Christian religion, no ordinary person can get up and say, \"I have got an inner conviction and therefore I want to be a priest/priestess\". The \"call\" in Akan religion is not an \"individual\" but a \"public\" affair. It usually occurs on public occasions when the public is called to witness and confirms it. To refuse a \"call\" from an Obosom usually results 133 in either madness or failure in economic ventures. However, should a candidate decide not to be a priest/priestess of a particular deity, she/he only has to plead for his/her release. If that particular Obosom accepts the plea, the candidate is released. If, on the other hand, the deity turns down the plea the candidate has to comply. The Akan hold the view that when the Obosom descends on a human being the latter will behave in a different way. One of my informants puts it this way: When an Obosom possesses you, the spirit of the Obosom enters your body. Your own body doesn't leave, but is overshadowed by the Obosom, which is more powerful. However, trance behaviour has created and continues to create problems in the minds of social anthropologists. Some anthropologists, such as Frazer, Radin, and Lowie hold the view that \"Spirit possession\" is madness or insanity. Among the most influential early writer on this subject is Frazer who wrote in 1913: Among savages the theory of inspiration and possession is commonly invoked to explain all abnormal mental states, particularly insanity or conditions of mind bordering on it. So these persons more or less crazed in their wits, and particularly hysterical or epileptic patients, are for that very reason thought to be peculiarly favoured by the spirits and are therefore consulted as oracles, for wild and whirling words passing for the revelations of higher power whether a god or a ghost who considerately screens his too dazzling light under a thick veil of sayings and mysterious ejaculations. I need hardly point out the very serious dangers, which menace any society where such theories are commonly held and acted upon. If the decisions of a whole community in matters of the gravest importance 134 are left to run on the wayward fancies the whims and vagaries of the insane or semi- insane, what are likely to be the consequences to the commonwealth? (Frazer 1913:1 5). Radin in 1937 spoke of mediums as \"neurotics\" (Radin 1937: 9). In my field observation, I found no connection between possession and mental aberration. The Okomfo Afua Nsiah shows no signs in her everyday life of being unbalanced or insane; she usually appears to be in good physical and mental health. Spirit possession behaviour among the Akan is not viewed as a bizarre manifestation of hysteria, neurosis or psychosis. The Okomfo is not seen as a victim of social frustration and pathological delusion. The possession state is simply a concrete expression of the deity's honest attempt to establish a meaningful and personal relationship with the candidate (Salman 1969: 183). Beattie supports the Akan view when he states: We have spirit possession when a person assumes a state of apparent auto-hypnosis or disassociation, and his behaviour which is not that of his ordinary self, is understood to be due to the control by some spiritual agent normally outside himself (Beattie 1964: 229). Field's studies on spirit possession in Ghana confirm this conclusion when she writes: The profession of priests [hood], like any of the professions in our country \u2014 medicine, the stage, the bar, the police, - contains its quota of poor and base personalities, its leaven of richly endowed excellent personalities and its body of ineffective pedestrian members. By and large the people who dwell in it exhibit the same personal qualities which would bring them esteem and success (Field 1960: 76). 135 The Okomfo Afua Nsiah admitted to me that there are, of course, people in the community who are mentally deranged and are known and treated as such. But she told me that the behavior caused by mental illness and the behaviour caused by the mediumship of Abosom spirits is not similar. Moreover, the diviners and the mentally ill are different persons. In fact the diviner helps to cure the mentally ill. The Okomfo Afua Nsiah explained further that the fact that it is the Obosom which cures all kinds of diseases is a clear sign that the spirit is not a threat to humanity. She concluded that it is, in fact the healing of the mentally and emotionally disturbed that has given and continues to give Akom/o their position and power. Spirit possession directs and warns of all problems that disturb humanity and helps to maintain order in the society (Onwuej eogwu 1975: 63). The phenomena itself depends on two important factors or \"aids\": drumming and dancing. 5-2 Twene-bo (drumming) Within the Akan religious context of spirit possession there are a number of methods applied but Okomfo Afua Nsiah utilises only drumming, singing, and dancing. I will discuss drumming in this chapter; and dancing in the next. The word Twene is a \"drum\" which represents all drums. When Bo is added, it means, \"to play drum\" or simply \"drumming\". Drumming plays an important role in the life of Akan and Africans generally. Any two nights visit in any African country will notice this important aspect of African culture. Unfortunately the colonial authorities and Christian missionaries once condemned it. To colonial authorities drumming was seen as an instrument of \"power resistance\", and to Christian missionaries it was interpreted as 136 an instrument of \"liberating satanic forces\" (Niangoran-Bouah 1991: 83). As aresult of this condemnation, most African drums were burnt and others were seized and kept in museums overseas. It is not an exaggeration to say that the Christian missionaries adopted and an attitude of blanket condemnation of African culture in all its aspects. African converts were required to turn their backs on the whole of their tradition and culture. Only then was it was considered that the Christian faith had truly taken root in their souls. The Ghanaian, late Alex Quaison-Sackey, describes this unfortunate situation when he writes: Perhaps worst of the deliberate attempt to eradicate or destroy our cultural heritage. Since drumming, for example, was considered by the church to be a heathen practice, the African Christians were at once cut off from the wellsprings of their culture \u2014 the rhythms of African music and dance... African medicine, too, was regarded as inferior; and if you were an African Christian, you were expected to seek help from the doctor of the hospital, not from the African herbalist, who had come to styled the 'witch doctor' or 'medicine' man. And yet it was these herbalists who throughout the ages had cured our fevers and our diseases. Their knowledge of the local herbs could have been used in the development of curative medicine in Africa, but instead he was condemned (Qauson- Sackey 1963:53). According to the Akan oral tradition, it was Odomankoma Onyame who created the drum. Their drum text says: Mfitiase Odomankoma boo den? (In the beginning what Odomankoma create?) 137 Odomankoma boo Okyerema, (The Odomankoma created the drummer). Okyerema wo wo he? (Divine drummer, where are you?) Ma wo ho so, na ma yente wo nka! (Wake up, make yourself to be heard!) Okyerema, wo wo he? Divine drummer, kasa, kasa, kasa, kyere yen! (We implore to speak, speak, speak to us!) There are several sizes of the drum with various sounds. For instance, there is the large open- headed drum called Bomaa and double-headed drum called Dono (ampit drum). The Dono changes tone when the drummer squeezes it under his/her armpit. The medium-sized, single- headed drum is called Atumpan, and comes in two- male and female- to sound the low or masculine pitch of the tonal language and the high or feminine pitch. The talking drum is primarily an instrument of prayer and mediation in connection with the Obosom Tigare and other spirits. Then the text of the drum is authentic in the sense that the Okyerema (a drummer) cannot change it. It is also conventional which means that the people of the old have agreed that the message should represent them (plat # 7). The duty of all the successive Akyverema (pl.drummers) is simply to append their signatures. In combination with singing, rhythmic dancing, crowd 138 excitement and other ceremonial aspects, drumming engenders an atmosphere in which possession becomes the expected, desired, and usual behavior. Possession arising specifically from the stimulation of drumming and ceremony alone is rare among the Akan, but it does occur occasionally to professional diviners. Within the cultic tradition, whether in the past or today, | drumming is relevant. The Akan word Akom means, \"dancing\". But it is more than ordinary \"dancing\". The Akom is a bodily movement which has many functions. It is admired as art: it is enjoyed as entertainment; it helps make political statement; it is performed at festivals and burials as a social duty; and it brings religious ecstasy or trance (Hanna 1979). In its religious dimension it is liken to a \"war\" dance and involves acrobatic leaps, kicking, jumping and twisting. It requires competence and concentration. 5-3 Akom (dancing and possession) Akom trance dancing follows a special procedure. About nine in the morning the drummers beat the first drum to summon the officials, elders, singers, and other spectators. This takes place in a large compound. The elders take their seats facing the dais (plate # 8). Between them and the sanctuary stands the small orchestra, consisting of two drums, a tonal drum and stumpy wooden drum. Sitting on the ground to one side of the sanctuary door with his/her back leaning against the sanctuary wall is the drummer, reiterating a little motif saying: Aduro ye, wo ni sika a, wo se aduro nye! Literally means \"Aduro is powerful, but those who can't afford, say it is bad\". The drummers, who are all men with a few women, gather in front of the shrine 139 sometimes before the dance commences. Some of the practitioners who know the steps of the drum begin to dance while Okomfo Afua Nsiah warms up. The Okomfo Afua Nsiah sometime with a skirt made of Odoso (raffia front) and with talisman all over her body and tinkling bells around the ankles. She wears beads on the shoulders and the chest which is bare (plate # 9). Before she begins she kicks off her sandals. Her face is painted with Hyire (white clay), a symbol of victory over all evil forces militating against and joys of the profession. The she holds out her hands to receive an egg. She flings the egg on to the flat top of the shrine to ascertain whether or not the deity approves of what is to take place. If it breaks with the shell fragments \"downwards\" it means the Obosom ligare disapproves of the dance. On the other hand, if the fragments of shell turn \"upwards\" it means the Obosom Tigare approves it. Immediately after the approval, the orchestra begins to play furiously in order to call the Obosom Tigare to possess her. Okomfo Afua Nsiah stands upright on one step with folded arms and her head increasingly shakes from side to side. Her facial expression immediately looks scary with her red eyes rolling from side to side and her eyebrows flickering up and down as though they are worked by machinery. The drums redoubled their frenzied beating, the gong- gong its iron clatter and the horn its piercing cries. After a couple of minutes the Okomfo Afua Nsiah stretches her left hand for an egg again and then smashes it. The Okomfo Afua Nsiah slowly and repetitively places her right foot forward and backwards, returning each time to her starting position with both feet side by side. Turning to face the opposite direction, she repeats the exercise. With this formulaic opening, she then 140 describes a circle, dancing clockwise and counter-clockwise. After sometime she breaks out the circle. She often gazes downward, and her dance movements diminish. As if bound to the stop, Okomfo Afua Nsiah stops moving her feet; her upper torso veers to the side; her head drops; and her left knee quivers, causing her body to tremble. All the time, the attendants rush to straighten her clothes and bind her waist and breasts, in much the same way as a rider saddles a horse, pulling the straps tightly to secure the saddle in place, for Obosom Tigare must \"mount\" and ride her medium. The practitioners believe that the Okomfo Afua Nsiah is fully transformed into a spiritual being when she is possessed. In the initial stage of the dancing, she places her hands on her hips, with knees and feet lifted and extended forward. The priestess walks around greeting the crowd while sprinkling the Hyire carried by an attendant. Then turns to \"five dependability acknowledge the support of Ancestors/ancestresses; Nifa to acknowledge the support of the multitude of Akan Abosom, and finally Mfinifini, which symbolizes her own power. After greeting the entire assemblage she sings and dances at the same time. During the performance, practitioners and spectators give money to her and the drummers. The amounts range from pesewas to several cedis (Ghana currency). By giving money to the Okomfo, the practitioners and spectators receive special recognition and blessing from her. In a sense they in her dynamic power, and in return they receive the benefit of the power. The Okomfo Afua Nsiah steps forward to sing. One of her popular song is: 141 Me bu obira (I respect everybody here) Nanso, so obi pe se okyere se osene me dia a, mebre no ase (But if anybody claims to be higher than me, I shall bring him/her down). The first step of the priestess's dance which is called Daaban acknowledges the wholeness and oneness of Obosom the the Afua Nsiah always moves the \"left\" leg and greets with the \"left\" hand. Moving and greeting from the \"left\" side is an abnormal behavior in the Akan tradition. The Akan proverb, which says nkyere ne pepa kurom kwan \"no child points to the direction of his/her father's village with the left hand\", condemns this behavior. But according to Okomfo Afua Nsiah, the \"left\" hand has a religious purpose. It is used for spiritual communication. As she puts it: \"The right hand is used by human beings, but the left hand is used by the Abosom\". The practitioners believe the left hand is reserved for ritual and must not be used in ordinary social discourse (Hertz 1973: 7). Another important element in Akom dancing is \"circle\". The crowd always sits in a circle with the Okomfo Afua Nsiah dancing in the middle. And when Okomfo Afua Nsiah dances, she dances in \"clockwise\" and \"counter-clockwise''. The significance of the dance is that as soon as she steps into the crowd she has to bind all spiritual forces. Hence dancing \"clockwise\", means she binds all the forces. And she releases them when she dances \"counter-clockwise.\" The symbol of the \"circle\" (plate # 11) has many meanings. In ordinary usage, \"circle\" means zero or nothing. The second definition is that \"circle\" stands for \"democracy\". That is, in 142 Akan traditional gathering they form circle which means everybody has the right to come inside and speak his/her mind. But in the Akom context circle it means \"eternity\". It stresses the fact \"no one can point out where the circle begins and where it ends\"; likewise no one will be able to trace the Abosom's beginning and when they will end. It expresses the eternity of Akan indigenous religion. Finally circle in Akan religion it expresses \"freedom of expression in worship\". For example, in Akom dancing, anyone who is moved and knows the rhythm has the right to come in and dance. Another important aspect of the Akom dance is \"symbolism\". When a priest/priestess raises two fingers to form the letter \"V\", and he/she stretches the \"V\" hand out upon the head. It means appreciation and admiration of Akan cultural dancing. Also, when he/she points the two hands to the \"west\" and \"east\" and then back to the \"chest\", he/she is saying: \"Everything belongs to me.\" However, in healing ritual, when he/she joins the right and the left hands behind his/her neck, he/she is saying: \"my hands are tied behind me, who will help me now that I do not have solution\" or \"I am alone without a helper.\" In Akan traditional thought, the joining of the hands on the top of the head expresses deep feelings of helplessness and sorrow. On the other hand, when she clenches the fingers on the right hand and leaves the thumb up pointing towards the on-lookers it is considered an insult. It means \"I do not care what you are\" or, \"You are nothing before me\". Most Akan hold the view that this negative aspect of traditional Akom dacing was initially not part of the Akom dance. Rather the Akan royals (wives, children, and sisters) danced it. They danced in that manner to demonstrate their superiority over their subjects and gradually 143 have been incorporated into Akom dance. The end of the Akom dance could be gradual or rapid process. Sometimes Okomfo Afua Nsiah spins rapidly while standing, then suddenly falls into the arms of her attendants. Then the attendants rush her away from the crowd. At other times it takes a very gradual cessation of activity accompanied by shaking of head which indicates the end of the dance. She is given water to drink or gin and comfortable walks to her chamber and sleeps. After some hours she regains command of herself and the Akom is over. The final important element in Akom dance is that it is also a kind of entertainment men dancing with men and women dancing with women. They move their bodies and keep to the beat of the drum, but it is far from the style of western ballroom dancing. In the latter a man and woman hold each other close and dance together. The Akom dance is never danced in that manner. The Kosua (an egg) plays important role in Akom dancing. Apart from its religious significance it throws on the Akom dance, Kosua symbolizes \"prudence\" and \"fecundity.\" The egg does not contain a hard material; it is therefore represents peace in dancing. Again, it is fragile and it represents carefulness and prudence in Akom art. The very oval shape which is the symbol of female beauty represents the beauty of the Akom dancing. 5-4 Obosom Training Does an Okomfo need special training or does he/she rely solely on experience gained from his/her predecessors? Some scholars say that all the training a priest/priestess receives 144 comes to him/her through the experience he/she gathers and by observing what is being done by his/her predecessors (Nabofa and Elugbe 1981: 11). However, other scholars, like (Nwoaga 1984; and Agwu 1995) say that experience is necessary but does not offer any priest/priestess the comprehensive knowledge he/she requires in the profession. The priest/priestess must also learn the professional tactics and dispositions for dealing with day-to-day cases. The priest/priestess always needs to understand the particular circumstances of any case in order to handle it effectively. This is particularly important in divination. It complements the supernatural powers of the priest/priestess with natural and learned skills. Some kind of formal learning has always obtained in these professions. As Waal Malefijt observes: ...Diviners and diagnosticians do not merely rely upon the supernatural for their answers. Often they accompany their magical techniques by shrewd questioning, or by taking their cues from a patient's own suspicions...In small communities, where not many things remain hidden the diviner will usually be quite familiar with the personal circumstances of the patients as well as with local antagonism. This knowledge will assist him reaching conclusion which are satisfying to the sufferer and acceptable to the community (Malefijt 1968: 254). The Akan position is that possession alone does not automatically make one a priest/priestess. Those possessed must normally undergo a period of training so as to be instructed in the ways of the deity and equipped for effective service in their communities. As the Akan put it, Se akom si obi a, ewo so wode no ko ntetebea, which is translated \"when there are indications of a person's call into the priesthood, it is necessary for him/her to go for training\". Among the Akan, like the 145 Yoruba, the Okomfo undergoes training which involves a long and tedious period in the course of which the novitiate must master different techniques and commit to memory a huge store of ritual recitations (Onaiyekan 1983: 49). In the first year of his/her training, he/she undergoes certain tests which symbolize ritual death. This includes the placing of two knives, one iron, and the other wood, on the tongue. Then there is \"burial\" under a skin impregnated with irritating substances; walking on burning cinders; passage under an arche; and a short stay in a straw hut. The test of knives symbolizes the \"life\" and \"death\" of the novitiate. The iron knife is believed to \"kill'' him/her, but the wooden one to instill in him/her the germ of life. According to indigenes, the meaning of the death is that the novitiate's body must be deprived of the care which an ordinary person usually gives to his/her body. The deprivation is to sleep on a bed of leaves on the ground, and drink without using the arms. The novitiate's nails are clipped but the hair is not shaved until the end of his/her training. Whether he/she is married or not, sexual relations are strictly forbidden since, as the \"spouse\" of the divinity, he/she is obliged to remain faithful to his/her new partner. As a \"spouse\" of the divinity, he/she has to dedicate his/her whole life to the deity. In the convent, the novitiate eats separately and carries food to the mouth with the left hand which is contrary to African food ethics. In eating, Africans use the right hand and eating with the left hand indicates a change in personality, from \"self\" to a \"deity\". During the training he/she receives a new name. As one of my informants put it: Tf any one calls him/her by his/her old name, he/she will fall down as if dead, or call out the person's name; for his/her own self died before his/her entry to the convent. A heavy 146 fine will be imposed upon the offender, sacrifice must be offered to the deity, and all or part of the training of the novice may have to be taken afresh. The Obosom training is similar to African hunting expeditions in the bush. Likewise the novitiate in training must forget everything about home. As Ajuwon puts it: \"Traditionally a hunter is like a watrior or a scout in time of conflict. Even if the hunter's outfit is torn and cannot serve him adequately, he/she cannot turn back\" (Ajuwon 1997: 182). If he/she has relations with women, his/her Obosom will be \"hot\" whereas it must remain \"cool\". Here, certain rules are indispensable in order to avoid the madness which can take possession of him/her. Like the hunter, the novitiate needs to return to his/her domestic life after his/her trip. In Akan thinking, the hunter is the same as a novitiate in training, the only difference being that the former concentrates on animals and the latter on spirits. In sum, the technique for the training contains a common denominator \u2014 the temporary alienation of the very being of the person concerned. It is a way of \"leaving\" in order to \"return\", \"abandoning\" one's kinsmen totally in order to \"find\" them afterwards, and especially letting oneself go totally in order to \"recover\" oneself anew. Like any profession, the novitiate must know the language of his/her Obosom. The special language includes jargons, phrases, idioms, and proverbs which meanings are derived from the region in which the cult originated. This special language training is sometimes complicated. This is because there are some Abosom who speak different tongues, which are not common to his/her clients. The Obosom training takes three years and has three divisions, each lasting a year. The first year is to help the novitiate familiarize him/herself with ritual ablutions. The second year is 147 devoted to \"divination\", and the final year 1s for \"immunization\". The first year training is to strengthen his/her ankles through what the indigenes call Dware dudo, \"bathes in medicine\". The Dudo comprises leaves, plants, and roots mixed together. The main purpose of the preparation 1s to help the novitiate dance by twisting the legs, hands, and the neck without breaking them. There are also concoctions which cause the Obosom to stay with him/her. One of them is normally rubbed in the novitiate's eyes so that he/she sees the deity daily. Should the Obosom Tigare fail to appear to the novitiate another juice extracted from leaves is rubbed on the novitiate's ears. If the novice does hear the deity's voice, the leaves are put under his/her pillow. Another part of the training is to ask the novitiate to walk alone at midnight to the Nsamanpowmu (local cemetery). This part of the training is to help the novitiate familiarize him/her with Nsamanfo \"ancestral spirits\". It is believed to be a risky exercise, for the ghosts sometimes confront the novitiate and question him/her. The ghosts even \"beat\" the novitiate and it is a taboo to retreat. However, the exercise is not to destroy, but to equip him/her with spirits of the living-dead. The second year training is essentially brain training. The brain training is to help the novitiate have quick retentive memory. It includes memorization of the names of certain herbs and roots, as well as their symbolic\" meanings. Also, instructions as how to \"divine\" or to change a client's \"fate\" are part of the syllabus. The following are some the names of the things that the novitiate must by all means memorize: 1. Oguan konimono (the bone which immediately joins the head to the neck of a sheep. 2. Soso (mattock). 8. 9. 148 Abramo (weights for measuring gold). Nyame asoso or Nyame akuma (stone axe or God's axe). Ate (marble). Nwa-nwene (the shell of a snail). Akoko-ti (the head of a fowl). Abosea (grovel). Kosua (egg) and 10. Ta (wooden ladle). The context or use of these things is: l. Oguan-konimono: when the priest/priestess stirs the ingredients and the 7a draws out the neck-bone twice in succession, or the third time in interrupted sequence, 1t means the Asamanfo (ancestral spirits) want a sheep. Soso: is used for digging and it therefore indicates death. When the priest/priestess invokes Soso in divination, it means the inquirer will die if the Obosom Tigare does not help the patient. . Abromo: indicates money. It means that the patient is ill because his/her Kra (soul) 1s sorry it is in debt. Nyame Akuma: indicates that the person will die shortly because his/her Kwaha (the technical word for life) is short. The priest/priestess cannot alter the fate of the client for his/her death comes from Onyame. Ate: indicates that the client will get into trouble very shortly. The Twi idiom in 149 connection with Ate (marble) is Wani rebete wo ho, meaning, \"you will soon be in confusion\". 6. Nwanwene-to: indicates desolation. The esoteric phrase in connection with the empty shell is Wo fie rebebo meaning, \"your family will become desolate', or \"death will destroy your family\". 7. Akoto-ti: indicates that the Obosom which the client serves wants a fowl. The esoteric phrase Wo ti ato akoko, means, \"you need a fowl to make a sacrifice to avert a calamity. 8. Abosea: (grovels) are supposed to help the priest to call the attention of the Obosom by the sound they make when stirred in a water-pot. 9. Kosua: implies that the client's Kra (soul) wants an egg. In other words the client must make a propitiation, often in the form of mashed yam and egg. There 1s a specific procedure to alter a patient's Hyebere (fate). If itis Onyame which causes the death, the priestess cannot change it. The death is symbolized by Nyame-akuma (God's axe) which indicates death. But if it is an Obosom somewhere who is causing the death the priest/priestess can alter it. The Nyame-akuma is not a manifestation of an Obosom but of the Abodee (the Creator). The Obosom may be implored to entreat the Obodee to lengthen the client's life since the Obosom cannot do it by him/herself. It is interesting to note that in Akan religion, the altering of a fate is impossible without the Obodee 's help. 150 5-5 Nse-die (commission vows) The novitiate has to observe a number taboos in order to remain ritually clean and powerful. The taboos are as follows: l. Nko abeso nkonom nsa (Do not go to the palm tree and drink wine). The reason is that the novitiate may become intoxicated and reveal the secret of Akom art. Besides, a novitiate has to maintain a high degree of sobriety while she gazes into water and interprets what she sees and hears; but a priest/priestess cannot execute this very important function under the influence of alcohol). Nko obi fie nkodi nkomm; wo Wura ne wo nkommo-difo (Do not go to anybody's house and converse. The reason is that his/her tutor is the only conversationalist). Nni atomprada (Do not eat newly cut plantain). It gives one stomach trouble and makes one feel nauseus if one eats it. This inconveniences a priest/priestess in attending a client. Nni abaa aduane (Do not eat food which has been prepared by any woman. Menstruationis a taboo and a priestess may not know whether the woman who prepared the food was in her menstrual period). Mmfi abosom fie, bere a obiara mma wo kwan (Do not leave the Obosom's premises without permission. A novitiate should not go outside of the precincts of the shrine without special permission. The reason is that the novitiate should always remain within the sight of the Okomfohene (senior priest/priestess) who watches all the trainees. Constantly remaining within the precincts of the shrine, except when on 151 errands, means that the novitiate's conduct can be scrutinized. Also, it helps the novitiate resist the tendency to deviate from the accepted code of behavior). Mmfa wo ho nka barima ana Obaa (Do not have sexual intercourse). A novitiate should strictly abstain from sexual relations during the entire training period. The reason is that during the period of training, the novitiate is \"married\" to the deity to whose service he/she is dedicated. Infringement of this prohibition involves a purification exercise and a sacrifice to the offended deity. When a novitiate breaks the rule, he/she is asked to start his/her training all over again, or he/she may be banned from the shrine with all the opprobrium that goes with it. Even after training some sexual taboo are still observed. The priest/priestess is expected to abstain from sexual intercourse on days on which rituals are to be performed for the deity. It is believed that sexual relations before the performance of such important rituals render the officiating clergy ritually impure, and this further renders whatever rituals are to be performed null and void and of no consequence). Nni efemene adee (Do not eat sweet things. It is commonly believed that sweet things have a tendency to arouse sexual desire, the very impulse the novitiate is expected to keep in check during the training). Nni agoro wo abonten (Do not play in public. A novitiate should not join his/her friends in playing games in public). The Okomfo Afua Nsiah told a story to explain this point: One day a novice-priest joined his friends in a game of marbles. During the game, 152 one of them picked a quarrel with the priest about a marble. As a priest, he composed himself. He stopped the play and quietly went home. A few days after, at a fetish dance, some rum was given to this priest as gift to the Abosom. This priest took a sip and instructed his linguist to give the rest to the spectators. When the friend who had quarreled with the priest stretched his hand to receive the glass, the priest said: 'Mma no, mma no. Ono na one me kasa wo ate ho no. (Do not give him a drink, do not give him a drink, it was he who quarreled with me about a marble)'. Some of the spectators laughed and said: 'N'ani da ho', meaning 'he is sober, he is aware'. That is, Obosom had not possessed the priest. Before the incident, everyone had believed that the Obosom possessed the priest. These are some of the reasons why a priest/priestess must not join any public games, for quarrelling is strictly forbidden. The above rules also serve as a test of whether or not the novitiate will be a successful priest/priestess. If the novitiate proves disobedient or inattentive to the rules, the family is informed that the novice is not likely to make a good medicine man/woman and his/ her training will cease. The senior priest/priestess does not lose face when he/she gets rid of an inattentive or disobedient pupil. He/she must fast on all Dabone \"sacred days\". Even on the \"ordinary days\" she/he must never eat too much if he/she is to dream and see visions. Too much food induces deep sleep and prevents seeing visions. He/she must have white clay on his/her face and shoulders on the sacred days and wear garment worthy of his/her calling. The senior priest/priestess interrogates him/her from-time to time to find out whether or not the rules are 153 observed. In the second year of the training the novitiate also learns the names of trees, plants, reptiles, and insects which have spiritual properties in them. He/she learns African therapeutic techniques, such as methods, location of various plants, and how to prepare concoctions. In addition, she learns how to sing and dance. The songs are not only songs of the Obosom Tigare, but songs of other deities. The art of divination is part of the second year training. He/she practices this while sitting on a stool in front of the divining pot and ringing a hand-bell which summons the deity to appear in the pot and transmit messages to the priest/priestess-in-training. At the end of the second year, the senior priest/priestess takes an assessment. The assessment covers the novitiate's ability to hear correctly and to interpret what is heard. It also covers his/her ability to diagnose, prescribe, and cure diseases through looking into the \"divine- pot\". The \"divine-pot\" is believed to help the novitiate identify the causes of diseases as well as the ability to see and hear the sounds of animals, birds and insects. The senior priest/priestess does the assessment through discussions with the novitiate. He/she is tested on how to prepare Suman (charms) which are fastened on the wrists, ankles, and in the hair; how to perform propitiation by laying the Obosom on the ground and kneeling in front of it holding a live fowl. He/she is then told to demonstrate how to cut off its head and allow the blood to drop upon the Obosom, repeating certain words he/she has learned from the Okomfohene. When the novitiate enters the third year, he/she is \"immunized\". The immunization equips and gives evidence of his/her fitness for the profession he/she is about to undertake. The immunization takes the form of an \"incision\" on the right shoulder, back of the neck, forehead 154 and all the joints in the wrist. These are small cuts and black powder is rubbed in them. The incision stabilizes, toughens, and renders the novitiate immune to poisoning by his/her enemies in course of the profession. The incisions are in the following marks: l. = Incisions on right shoulder. 2. * \" Right shoulders. 3. # \"* \" Joints. 4. ' \" ' Back and the forehead. (The Okomfo Afua Nsiah has these marks on her). The novitiate appears for the final examination before the senior priest/priestess and the elders to ascertain how good the trainee is at the divine-pot. If he/she receives a favorable recommendation he/she is then allowed to present him/herself before the grant panel. If he/she is successful before the panel a date is fixed for the Akomyi. The relatives are informed accordingly to prepare for the occasion. The preparations include the payment of a fee of about five hundred thousand cedis (C500,000.00) (which may be waived if the family is poor). Sometimes the novitiate remains at the shrine to work for the senior priest/priestess. The family procures a large steel trunk, new clothing, buckets, beads, soaps, and other cosmetics, as well as large amounts of foodstuffs for the occasion. The passing-out ceremony takes place on Friday, but the preparations begin on Thursday. On this day the novitiate takes another final examination which consists of an endurance test; the purpose of the test is to examine the novitiate's physical endurance. Okomfo Afua Nsiah 155 described one in these terms: The Okomfohene sent the three priestesses-to-be in to Konongo. Each was given C500 with specific instructions as to what to buy on the market. The priestesses-to-be left the village in the morning, each carrying a white enamel basin on her head. They were given strict instructions not to talk on their journey; they were only allowed to communicate with people by sign language. Furthermore, they were expected to do their journey on foot, a distance of about twenty kilometers. On their return, they were summoned to render account of their day's mission. They knelt before the Okomfohene as their wares were examined, and the change counted. Each priestess was allowed to keep any money that was left. This money was not supposed to be spent, but was to be kept on them to start their work in their respective shrines at the end of their training. After the exercise, the Okomfohene congratulated the priestesses-to-be and were led to aroom to eat. The foods were bananas, oranges, bread, biscuits, plantain, cassava, yam as well as vegetables. Part of the food was offered to the deities by being thrown in all directions and then the crowd which had gathered also received their share. The rest was taken away to be cooked the next day. 5-6 Akomyi (graduation ceremony) The term Akomyi marks the end of the training and the beginning of new life. It is an occasion to retrieve what is lost and for symbolic death and resurrection. The ceremonies, which are performed at the various stages of the day, are meant to emphasize the idea of newness and 156 emergence into new life. Under-girding the whole range of ceremonies and rituals is what Parrinder calls \"the symbolism of death and resurrection, the casting away of the old clothes and putting on new one\" (Parrinder 1961: 86). The ritual involves the cutting of hair, shaving of all the private parts, and the clipping of the nails as well as a ritual bath in a river. In short, it means the old life has passed away, and the new life has emerged. The important aspect of this ritual is that after this day the novitiate is reunited with her family, friends, and the entire community. All prohibitions and restrictions cease. He/she is at liberty to visit his/her relatives, shake hands and talk with them without permission. The jubilation experienced can be likened to someone who has returned from a long journey. The day also marks the lifting of the ban on sexual relations. The novitiate is free to reunite with his/her spouse if he/she is already married. If not married he/she can now get married if he/she so desires. The Obosom Tigare Akomyi has five clear stages: (1) The Stringing of Beads, (2) At the house of the Elder, (3) Cutting of the Hair, (4) Dressing Up, (5) Procession to a stream. Stage 1 \u2014 The Stringing of Beads: The major activity of the Friday morning is the \"stringing of beads\". The Okomfohene and other priests/priestesses who have come to celebrate this particular occasion collect different kinds of beads and thread them one-by-one. The novitiate provides the beads and the officiating priests/priestesses do the threading. Normally the beads are placed on enamel plates. As they do the threading they measure the novitiate's neck, ankles, waist, wrist and knees to get the correct measurement. 157 Also the threading or stringing of the beads follows a particular order and pattern to suit the taste and idiosyncrasies of the deity in question. The Okomfohene supervises the exercise and also takes part in the stringing of the beads. The male (priests) do not take part in the threading. But while female priestesses are in the process of threading the beads, the male (priests) work on other regalia in the inner tabernacle of the Obosom Tigare with knives and other instruments where they polish it with white clay and egg. The rest of the male priests bundle up the novitiate's old clothes and anything else used while he/she was in training and dispose of them ritually. The disposal of the old things symbolizes the passing away of the old life and the old self, and entry into the new life of a fully- fledged priest/priestess. Stage 11 \u2014 At the House of Okomfohene After the disposal of the old clothing, the novitiate goes to the elders at the male section of the shrine. Before the elders the novitiate crouches on his/her knees and elbows in a semi- circle and receives advice. Then the Okyeame pours libation, thanking the novitiate and wishing him/her success in life. At the end, the Okyeame thanks the Obosom Tigare. When the libation is over, the new priest/priestess crawls to the Okomfohene who pours liquor on the back of the neck. The novitiate then retires to the female section for the cutting of the hair, which is the third stage. Stage IJ \u2014 Cutting of Hair For the cutting of the hair, the novitiate procures a new razor or blade and comb, and puts all on an enamel plate. He/she picks a white stool from the shrine and sits on it and the 158 Akomfohene (chief priestess) ceremonially cuts two strands of the hair and puts them on the enamel plate with the following exhortations: Mintwitwa wo ti se. (I am not cutting your head so that) 1. Fa kobo tuutuu (You may go into harlotry), 2. ka kobo apo, (You may go to extort), 3. Fa kowia adee (You may go to steal) (I am cutting it so that you may) 4. Wohu wo payin a, bu no. (Respect your elders). 5. Diwo kunu/yere ni. (Respect your spouse). 6. Di wo ni ne wo se ni. (Hour your parents) 7. Bre wo ho ase ma wo manfo na wo manfo nso abu wo (Humble yourself before your towns-people so that they in turn may respect you). Thereafter, three men join the cutting, beginning from the forehead and proceeding to the back. This symbolizes that all evil things pass over. Then they nicely trim the undergrowth, which 159 gives the novitiate a new look. He/she collects the hair for safe keeping in the shrine. Stage IV \u2014 Dressing Up: After the hair cutting, the novitiate goes to a dressing room where the Akomfohene puts the (already prepared) beads around the neck, wrist, waist, legs and ankles. While the dressing goes on, the relatives of the novitiate bring into the room a steel-trunk filled with new items such as clothing, buckets, and enamel basins containing soap, towels, lavenders, combs, etc. The Okomfohene meticulously examines each item and gets rid of inappropriate articles. It is believed that everything must be new and bright in conformity with the occasion. Stage V \u2014 Procession to Botoku The final stage, which is just like Christian baptism, ends in Botoku (the local stream). The novitiate (in his/her full regalia) and the invited priests/priestesses led by Akomfohene, form a procession to the stream. The novitiate is right in front with two Abosom-asomfo throwing Ayire \"white chalk\" on him/her. Then follow relatives of the new priestesses who carry a white stool, enamel basins, buckets, containing towels, soap, lavenders, white cloth and other items needed to dress up the novitiate as he/she is ritually bathed and purified. At the rear of the procession are two young boys beating gongs. At the stream the Akomfohene and other senior priests/priestesses lay their hands on the novitiate and the Obosom Tigare possesses him/her. Ina state of possession, the novitiate takes Hyire and besmears on his/her face, arm, body and legs. He/she sprinkles his/her face with water from the stream and comes out. For seven days thereafter he/she bathes in a herbal concoction. 160 5-7 Obosom-nom (Obosom-eating) The Obosom-nom is one of the oldest religious rites practice in the Akan communities. It is a practiced marking the conclusion of agreements between two parties. Here the Obosom is called upon by the Okomfo to be a witness to the agreement. As Anon rightly put it: After the conquest of Akwamu, Prince Safora left the camp for Amanprobi, and summoned all the Akuampems to come there. He requested them to unite the cartridge belt from his lions, meaning by that, to pay him so as to retire home. At that time they [Akuapem] were poor having no gold dust, money, or even cloth to wear... Hence they asked Safora to remain as their king; he consented and informed Ofori Payin of it. To confirm this agreement, the new king requested them all to take an oath of the fetish Kyenku at Obosomase. They met at Abotakyi, and the fetish oath was administered with this promise that they would never throw off their allegiance to him or any successor for all time to come (Anon 1913:35). The term Obosom-nom, literally translated, means \"drinking Obosom\", but in fact there is no \"drinking\" or \"eating\" involved. It is a form of \"oath-taking\" where the Obosom is called upon to be a witness. This is the detailed account of how Okomfo Afua Nsiah took her oath: The Okomfohene asks me to bring a penknife and a bottle of gin or rum. The two of us entered a temple of Obosom Tigare. My trainer sat down by the shrine and stirred a big bowl with a wand and called upon the praise-title of the Obosom and said, 'Yebenom Obosom (we are coming to drink Obosom). I asked how is Abosom drunk? My trainer replied wait a moment'. He opened the pen-knife and made seven small incisions on the 161 front part of my right wrist and said: Nnye nananom akom a wo a bosom nkum me (If it is not the Akom art of the forefathers which I was taught that I have imparted to you, may the Obosom kill me). He rubbed black powdered medicine in the incisions and licked the blood. Immediately he uttered the above again. Then he asked me to make similar incisions in his right wrist after he had said following: Wo ka kyere obiara a Abosom a woagu akom anim ase. (If you tell anyone that we have entered into covenant, if you tell a linguist that we have entered into a covenant, you have disgraced akom; if you happen to tell anybody may Obosom Tigare kill you). The trainer rubbed the black powdered medicine in the incisions and asked me to lick the blood. I did and both of us drank some of the bottle of gin. He then cut a sheep for Obosom Tigare saying: gye guan yi di, nne guan ni, Tigare accept this sheep and eat; today you have completed marriage with her. This is a sheep from my own hands, stand behind her during her professional life, with good standing). (Personal communication 1998). After this ceremony she was received 1n the Abosom community and begun practicing the Akom. 162 Chapter 6 The Akan Concepts of Health and Illness 6-1 Concept of Health This chapter examines the traditional Akan concept of health, illness, and classification of illness in the light of the Abosom Tigare movement and the role of Okomfo Afua Nsiah as a healer. Among the Akan, treatment is a function of the disease; consequently, there is a corresponding triadic classification of medicine. The Akan word for \"health\" 1s Apomuden, and illness is Yaadee. The concepts of Apomudan and Yaadee are intricately interwoven. The Akan approach to health is expressed in such axioms as Yaadee ye ya, which is translated as \"to be unhealthy is painful'. This is because when a person contracts an illness or is attacked by a disease, he/she cannot perform his/her duties or functions within the community (Fabrega 1975: 972). The community, comprising family members, neighbours and friends is affected by the individual's illness and helps to select a therapy for the patient. Understanding the social significance of disease and health is the key to comprehending the role of indigenous religion in contemporary society. Apomuden is defined as a state of \"social wholeness\". The Akan concept of Apomuden (health) has two expressions: Me wo apomuden and Me ho ye. The Akan word Apomuden comes from two words, apomu, which refers to the \"body\", and den, which means \"strong\". Apomuden is translated as \"strong body'. The other expression is Me ho nye which simple means, \"I am not fine\". But Me ho nye is more than physical health, it 163 embraces economic, political, religious and social aspects. It may be translated as \"circumstances of life are hard\" or \"the economic situation is bad\" or simply \"livelihood is bad\". The \"circumstance of life\" means more than the economic. A person's livelihood depends on other aspects of life as well. As Appiah \u2014Kubi puts it: Among the Akan health is symptomatic of correct relationships between persons and their natural environment, the supernatural environment, and their fellow men and women. Health is associated with good, blessing, and beauty - all that are positively valued in life (Appiah-Kubi 1989: 212). The Apomuden shows that the Akan conceive life from the view of wholeness which suggests harmony within oneself and being in harmony with the world outside oneself. The indices of this well being are known as the seven blessings: Nkwa, or long life, vitality, good health, felicity, and prosperity; Adom or the favour of the spirit world on whom the living are supposed to depend for their well being; Asomdwee or peace of mind and peace in society, as well as freedom from perturbation; Abawotum or power to procreate, sexual potency and fertility through which the continuity, security, and well being of the individual and the clan is ensured; Anihitum or good eyesight; or Asotatum or good hearing power; and Amandoree or the prosperity, vitality and the greatness of the clan or the tribe (Pobee 1987: 55). The Akan terminologies indicate that the Akan understanding of well being is very complex, being both material and spiritual, internal and external, human and non-human, individual as well as communitarian. Apomuden is similar to the Yoruba concept of Alafia which means \"peace\", or the word 164 Sim among the Hausa people which means \"to be in peace\", and integral'', \"to All these expressions - Apomuden, Alafia and Slm - embrace the totality of the individual in his/her physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and psychological well being. The Yoruba, like the Akan, believe that to be healthy is to possess Alafia (Ademuwagun 1978: 89). To be healthy is to be at peace within oneself, one's environment, and fellow human beings. The absence of any of these variables is an indication that the individual is not well (Ampofo and Johnson-Romauld 1978: 40). Other important Akan expressions of health are Su nkwa na nsu adae (Pray for health but not goods), and Wo wo Nkwa wo adee (if you have health, you have everything). These expressions suggest that the Akan view health as \"wealth\". The Yoruba have similar expressions such as Alafia l'ogun oro meaning, \"health is wealth\", and Eni bal'Alafial'ohun gbogbo, that is, \"whoever has health has all things\". In fact the Huasa language goes even further in saying Lafiya ta fi dukiya, which means \"health is better than wealth\". When a Huasa man says, Zama lafia ya fi zama sarki, which means \"being well is better than being a chief\", he/she is not only referring to one aspect of life, he/she is also referring to the whole totality of a human being -- physical, emotional, spiritual, and domestic tranquillity - which is seen as superior to material goods or political power (Wall 1988:334). The Akan expression Me wo nkwa (I have health), means that health is something to be \"possessed\". This is evidence in Akan and Yoruba salutations. The Akan, for example, in greeting one another say Wo ho te sen? (How are you? or How is your body?) The interpretation is \"Do you possess health?\" Similarly, the Yoruba greet one another with this expression: Se 165 Alafia ni? which means \"Do you have Alafia?\" or \"How are you?\" These greetings are intended to inquire into the total well being of the individual. The usual response is Me ho ye or Me wo wo Nkwa, that is, \"I am well or \"I have health\" for the Akan; 4 dupe, which is translated as, \"I have Alafia', for the Yoruba. Health, among the Akan and other Africans, is a correct relationship between persons and their natural environment, and persons and their fellow human beings. The natural environment must be treated with respect; it is to be nurtured and not to be raped, exploited and destroyed. The Akan see health as proper relationship between human beings and \"nature\" (Asare Opoku 1974: 37), with \"nature\" or the \"environment\" seen as a \"living thing\" which needs as much proper care as human beings. Hence the Akan set aside some days of the week to honour nature. During that time nature is not \"disturbed\" (for example, Nana Bosompo, the ocean, is not \"disturbed\" on Tuesdays). Nature then is sacred and something upon which human beings' health is strongly depended. The concept of health also is to fulfil one's role and obligation. As Appiah-Kubi puts it: Health is seen in terms of fulfilling one's social, moral, and biological obligations. Thus, to be healthy implies health of mind, body, and spirit, and it calls for living harmony with one's neighbours, with the environment, and with oneself \u2014 a total harmony that encompasses physical, social, spiritual, natural, and supernatural realities (Appiah-Kubi 1989; 211). This broad and comprehensive Akan concept of health, common among many African peoples, does not confirm Wall's definition of health as the \"absence of disease\" (Wall 1988: 335). Rather 166 it agrees with True's view of disease. As he rightly puts it: We now understand that single factor of reasoning was not adequate to explain tuberculosis. Today science again is required to include such non-microbial factors as family characteristics, health status, housing, and genetic susceptibility to the ecological equation, because single-factorial models are not sufficient to account for occurrence of an increasing number of disorders (True 1996: 327). 6-2 Concept of Illness The Akan proverb Se Onyame ma wo yaadee, oma wo ano aduro, means \"If Onyame causes the illness, he provides the cure\". In Oath-taking when a subject takes a state sword and raises it before the \"King'', one declares: Me osomasi, yafre me se mesom me Nana I am so and so, who has been asked to serve my King, Mehye bo se, se awia oo, anodwo oo, nsuo Mennan makyi ma wo, Gye yadee, I will never turn my back to you, except when I am ill. Se medane makyi, ma woa, meto Ntam Kese Should I break the promise, I break the Great Oath of Ancestors. Illness is one of the most serious impediments in human life. As an Akan proverb says, Obi benya woa na efiri yadee, which is translated to mean, \"When illness strikes, one becomes a 167 burden to the entire community\". The Akan term for illness is Yaadee. Yaadee has two root words \u2014 Ya means \"a pain\" and Adee, means a \"thing\" or \"something\". When the two words are put together it is translated as \"something which causes pain or is painful\". The Akan employ the metaphor \"pepper'', to describe illness. Pepper is hot and the Akan describe the \"hotness\" as Ya; but they do not consider \"pepper\" as a disease. It is used as a symbol to express the idea that illness is painful such as when a man offends his/her friend, he/she describes the feeling Eye me ya se mako, that is, \"it pains me like pepper\". Eye me ya, connotes the idea of \"dis-ease\" or \"discomfort\". In Akan thinking if a person says Eye me ya se mako it means he/she is in a state of \"dis-ease\" or does not feel \"ease\". It can refer to a certain part of the body which is dis-eased or a part of the body which is not well. The Akan concept of Yadee is a broad term which includes famine, drought, epidemic, failure in business, impotency, blindness and many others (Fink 1989: 223). In other words, Yaadee is anything that causes pain, disturbance, anxiety, disharmony, discomfort, dis- equilibrium, or chaos in society and among individuals. As Ampofo and Johnson-Romaud put it: Disease is not merely something resulting from malfunctioning in this or that organora lesion therein... but essentially of a rupture of the life's harmony, to be imputed either to a material cause instinct with some 'intangible force' or directly to that intangible force itself. It is...aetiology of disease not only in the material but also in the immaterial world (Ampofo and Johnson-Romauld 1978: 40). The Akan expressions Me ho aye me mmere (my body is weak), Me ntumi nsore (I can't 168 stand), Me ntumi nkoto (I can't bend), view Yaadee as a condition in the body. When illness strikes it means something has happened to it and, as a consequence, it is not in the state it should be. These expressions put Yaadee into the realm of power and relationship. All illnesses, but particularly a serious one, means erosion of power, and a sick person is spoken of as \"losing\" or \"gaining\" as the illness progresses or recedes. Thus, a person may become so sick that he/she loses \"power\" to sit, stand, or even cough or breathe. This power is not the energy to perform those human functions, but the decline of one's being itself. This decline of power is symptomatic of broken relationships, and consequently of disturbed harmony and peace in the community. Whatever the cause of the affliction, it ultimately means that there is no order or peace \u2014 either among human beings, or between them and spirits, and ancestors. 6-3 Attitudes to Illness Although illness is universally anxiety provoking, peoples' attitudes to illness are not the same. Whereas some will get sick leave and rush to their family physicians with flu, others will stay at work and cope with it. The Akan react in two different ways, depending on whether the illness is \"serious\" or \"minor\". A \"serious\" illness is termed Yaadee-ehu and a \"minor\" one, Yaadee-hunu. The term Yadee-ehu means fearsome, dangerous, or life threatening illness. Some use the expression Yaadee-kese \"big disease\", while others use Sumsum-yaddee (supernatural disease), but they all connote the same idea of \"fearsomeness\"'. It is \"fearsome\" because there is believed to be an active, purposeful, agent behind the illness which may be a human or non- human agent who is against the victim. In the Akan tradition, the Yaade-ehu allows no room for 169 accident or chance and is not contagious (Warren 1979: 39). There are criteria and rules which make this classification understandable. If the disease is contagious and the victim knows he/she has contacted someone suffering from such a disease, the disease is classified as Yaadee-hunu. That is a minor \"naturally-caused disease\". Natural- caused disease is acquired through the process of contagion. If, on one hand, the disease is contagious but the victim is not aware of any contact, the disease is classified as Yaade-hunu. Or if the disease is contagious but the victim is unaware of a problem in his/her family history, the disease is considered Yaadee kese (serious). If there is no trace of the either of two, it means the disease is spiritually-caused either by breaking a taboo or by an angry ancestor (Warren 1979: 39). Okomfo Afua Nsiah puts it nicely in this way: Ifaman 'sleeps' (means sexual intercourse) with a married woman and later learns that he has contracted Babaso (gonorrhoea), the disease will be classified as Yaadee-kese. If, the victim on the other hand, 'sleeps' with a Gyantrani (prostitute) and contracts Babaso, the disease would be classified as Yaade-hunu (a naturally caused disease). The difference between the two is that the former has broken a cultural norm and the disease is seen as a punishment for the breach of the taboo. In this case, the disease becomes what the Akan call Ko-ankoro disease. The Akan word Ko is \"cure\" and ankoro has a negative connotation which means, \"not to go\". To the Akan, Stills rightly puts it: \"If a wound does not heal, a sickness does not respond to treatment, the normally expected and predictable do not happen then it becomes a chronic disease\" (Stills 1968: 87). Similarly, in the Akan tradition, if an illness fails to respond to treatment, it is termed as, \"not an ordinary 170 disease\". That is, there is \"somebody\" behind it. It is believed that an angry person causes Yaaade-ehu and until that person withdraws his/her anger there is no cure. It is not easy to differentiate between Yaade-hunu and Yaade-ehu. What one-person takes as an ordinary illness, another person may take to be supernatural. Also, a headache may be a normal thing for one person, for he/she believes everybody gets one from time to time, while another person takes it as very serious. A headache also may be an ordinary headache in the morning but supernatural in the evening (Ayoade 1972: 49). The Akan view of illness begins with Yaade-hunu before it moves to Yaadee-ehu. When sickness strikes, it is normally taken to be a \"natural\" sickness, but if it fails to respond to treatment then it is taken to be as 'supernatural'. Opayin Fosu's attitude to his spouse's sickness Akan react to Fosu' and his wife Obapayin Abena Manu lived about one hundred kilometres away from Nsiakrom. For about six month the wife complained of chest and bodily pains. The husband did not become worried about his wife's sickness for it was harmattan season, the time for catching bodily and joint pains. The cold mornings and evenings, sometimes as low as 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit, tended to have this effect on older people. So Opayin Fosu took it as Yaadee-hunu hence he did not pay much attention. After some time, he discovered that the illness was increasing instead of subsiding and they came to Nsiakrom for consultation. The Okomfo Afua Nsiah explained that two years ago, Abena Manu pledged to Obosom Tigare that if she helped her to get good harvest, she would give Tigare aram. But at the end of the year she got good harvest and had failed to 17] redeem her pledge. This failure had caused the sickness. The husband paid the amount and the wife became well (personal communication 1979). The important point in this case is that Abena Manu's illness began as Yaadee-hunu but later became Yaade-ehu. 6-4 Nature-caused Illness Most social scientists hold the view that African illnesses are attribute to supernatural causes. (see Yoder 1982: 11). But Waite holds that few illnesses among African speaking people are, in fact, attributed to supernatural causes. He concludes that African peoples in the past knew of several natural causes of illness and that their traditional healers treated common ailments such as malaria, sleeping sickness, measles, as well as supernatural illness (Waite 1981). My fieldwork revealed that the Akan recognize multiple causes which are classified as \"environmental-caused\", \"human-caused\", \"supernatural-caused, and \"Onyame-caused\"'. The Akan idea of a nature-caused disease reminds me of what happened to me when | was 18 years old. I had series of headaches but my father did not take me to any shrine. He attributed the cause of the illness to an excess of blood which he referred as Mogya-moroso \"plethora\". His opinion was that treatment should be to diminish the blood supply in order to starve the disease. The Akan term this Pokuwa, \"starvation\". Pokuwa is to reduce the blood supply by letting it out. What my father did was, he lit piece of cloth soaked with palm oil into a clean pomade bottle; then he made three incisions on my right cheek and when blood started to flow; he placed the pomade bottle with the burning cloth inside on the spot. After a few minutes 172 blood started to flow. This is called Pokuaa Environmental caused or nature-caused diseases are diseases caused by air or wind, etc. in the environment. They are not caused as a result of personal, purposive conditions. The Akan believe that illness can result from \"bad\" air involving seasonal changes in weather and wind patterns. Weather usually changes from wet to dry, cold to hot, and vice versa and these changes are held to cause certain diseases such as flu and the common cold. Malaria, which is associated with mosquitoes, is common in the rainy season. Drinking dirty water and eating contaminated food leads to such problems as abdominal pains, dysentery and typhoid. Contaminated food may cause diarrhoea which in turn may include headaches. Also poor diet and a shortage of food, especially among infants and children, may cause diseases like marasmus and kwashiorkor. The Akan are aware that when a wind blows from one place to another it carries along bacteria for which they say Aframa de yaadee na enam. For example, Mpompom (boils) are believed to come about through the changes in wind patterns. This and others illnesses the Akan regard as \"nature- caused\" (Foster 1976). The Akan categorise inherited diseases as nature-caused. Such diseases may be passed along the lineage line to one's offspring. A good example is Nsamanwa (tuberculosis) or Ahera yaadee (endogene) or (liver cirrhosis). Another inherited disease is Dam (mental disturbance). The passing of a disease from one lineage to another may not be direct (i.e. from parent to offspring) and be from the living-dead members of the family especially grandparents to grandchildren (Sindiga 1995: 110). In some cases nature-caused diseases are believed to be picked up from the environment in which one lives. But, as noted above, one disease may not be 173 caused exclusively by one factor. A disease caused in a naturalistic manner may at another time be seen as human-induced. For example, headache and fever are clear signs of malaria but the same symptom may be brought by nature-caused, human-induced, or even supernatural causes. Likewise, Dam (mental illness) may be human-induced, or inherited, or a result of breaching taboo, while marasmus can be caused by insufficient or poor quality food. 6-5 Human-caused IIIness In Akan communities there is a widespread belief in the ability of some people to cause harm to others through evil designs. As Field puts it: \"Further, a bad conscience and evil thought towards others are held to disturb the peace of the indwelling spirit which in turn disturbs the owner's health\" (Field 1960: 113). Such evil people employ either Bayie (witchcraft) or Adubone (sorcery) to bring illness and other misfortunes on their perceived enemies. Sorcery involves antisocial, nefarious acts, and is suspected when people die suddenly or have an illness that is unexplainable and progresses rapidly (Janzen 1971: 239). Bayie involves the use of special herbs and other medicines to cause illness. The Bayifo employs different techniques to harm their intended victims, some of which are gender-specific. Some witches cause sickness by dancing naked in the homestead of the victim. Others collect materials associated with the victim (personal effects such as clothing, hair, nails, excreta or soil taken from their footprints) and hide them across the path of the victim or in his/her homestead which cause the victim to run into danger. The naked dancers are both men and women who perform in the person's courtyard whilst singing in low tones. The method of the dancers consists of jumping up and down, 174 pointing the bare buttocks at the door of the victim, or banging against it before suddenly dashing off. To achieve the desired effect, the dancer must combine the dance with a spell which causes the victim to suffer from headaches and pain in the muscles. Both men and women also collect objects from their victims; this is, of course, done secretly. 'T'o achieve this purpose, the witch has to tie them with certain poisonous roots (Wagner 1978)) known as Meneyene (mid-bush). Once the materials have been collected and the poisonous roots tied in a small bundle, they are placed in some appropriate receptacle for protection as a spell is recited. The receptacle is then hidden in some damp soil near a river, stream or spring. Female witches mostly cause this kind of illness which leads to a slow wasting away of the victim's health. Only male witches practise the act of causing victims to run into danger. Their method is to cause sudden accidents, snakebites, and attacks from wild animals, suicides, drowning, or being struck by a fallen tree. I encountered an example of this during my fieldwork in Duase near Konongo, a place famous for its skilled bonesetters. One of the patients, I was told, had fallen over a bridge on his way from the farm with other relatives. When he fell, the load of the firewood he was carrying fell on him and broke his back. The patient's mother, who had accompanied him to the shrine, told me the story. She broke down and fell at my kneels and asked, \"Why, deserve this? Tell me now, Papa, tell me. Whoever caused this will also be equally dealt with, believe me\"'. According to the Akan, another technique is to kill a special kind of lizard known as Abosom-akotere from the victim's homestead. Then, the animal is hidden at a place where the 175 victim passes, or over which he/she steps. When it is buried, the witch mutters a spell which specifies the kind of accident or death which he/she desires the victim to meet. The belief is that the medicine which is buried, emits its poison through the air to the victim and causes instant death. Another method of causing harm is to stuff \"medicine\" into certain material objects say, a dead snake, rabbit, bird, chicken or rotten egg, and place these objects along the pathway to his/her home or the farm of the targeted person. If the person crosses the hidden object he/she becomes immediately ill. Or the person sends a fly directly into the victim's mouth. When the fly is swallowed it settles in the lungs and is believed to generate diseases such as Nsamanwa (tuberculosis). Another poisoning techniques restricted to women, is the throwing of Mmoto (poisonous black powder) into the food of others. The Mmoto comprises objects such as hairs, bits of roots, beans, nails, fish bones etc., mixed with other poisonous substances. These materials are mysteriously transmitted into the body of her victim to cause acute sickness, a swollen stomach and cramps, vomiting, an intense headache and generally feverish condition. If the victim does not look for a cure, he/she will eventually die. Children may also be victims. Here certain particles, such as the hair of a dead fox, or excreta of a hyena are secretly put into the food of the child. If \"overdosed\" it is believed these particles will cause immediate death, but if \"underdosed\" it simply brings about stomach-ache and vomiting. Another form of human-induced illness is what the Akan call Ani-bone, or \"bad eye\" and 176 what anthropologists have labelled the \"evil eye\" (Reminic 1985: 176). It is believed that certain individuals possess Ani-bone and when they stare into the food of their victims it becomes poisonous and causes abdominal pain and constipation. Another human-induced disease is \"killing the enemy through a mirror'. This technique is commonly found in rural areas. It is used specifically to call an image of an enemy to appear into a mirror. When the image appears a knife is taken and stabbed into the heart of the image. Another method is to put some concoctions (herbs and roots grind into powder) on the picture and then set fire to it. It is believed this will cause the victim to suffer severe burns. Others pierce needles into the victim's image in the mirror. This causes the victim's neck to stiffen such that until the needles are removed he/she cannot turn his/her head. These kinds of illness are induced by the principle of \"transference of forces\" (Ayoade 1978: 52). The principle is that a person's personality goes into his/her intimate belongings and by affecting these, one affects the person's belongings like shoes, items of clothing or his/her hair. Furthermore, a person's spirit is believed to be breathed into anything with which he/she comes into contact such that anything with which another person comes into contact imbues that person with the former's spirit. This is why a medicine has the desired effect on a person with whom it comes into contact. 6-6 Supernatural-caused All supernatural illnesses are labelled as Bonsamyaadee; they include illness caused by Nsamanjfo (ancestors/ancestresses), Sipe (evil-thought), and Akyiwadee (breach of Bonsamyadee has two root words: Bonsam (demon) and yadee (illness), are illness caused by demonic powers. To the Akan, Sipe, which literally means ill feeling or evil thought, is another factor that can bring illness. As Turner, quoting an Obosom Ta-Kase priest, explains it: You know that every one has a Sumsum (soul) that may get hurt or knocked down about or become sick and so make the body ill. Very often, although there may be other causes, ill health is caused by the evil and the hate that another has in his/her head against you. Again, you too may have hatred in your heart against another, because of something that person has done to you, and that, too, causes your Sumsum to fret and become sick. Our forebears knew this to be the case, and so they ordained a time, once a year, when every man and woman, free man and slave, should have freedom to speak out just what was in their head, to tell their neighbours just what they thought of them, and their actions, and not only to their neighbours, but also the king or chief. When a man has spoken freely thus, he/she will feel his/her Sumsum cool and quieted, and the Sumsum of the other person against whom he/she has now openly spoken will be quieted also. The king of Ashanti may have killed your children, and you hate him. This has made him ill and you ill; when are allowed to say before his/her face what you think you both benefit (Turner 1968: 179). The Akan believe that Nsamanfo (ancestors/ancestresses) are responsible for certain illnesses such impotency, miscarriage, infertility, epilepsy and madness. The Akan believe that these Nsamanfo (ancestral spirits) act as intercessors between the living and the supernatural powers. Because of this belief the living have to maintain a vertical relationship with their 178 ancestors/ancestresses. If the living ignore this relationship for one reason or another, the ancestors/ancestresses show their displeasure by causing illness. Sometimes the Nsamanfo make certain demands on their living relatives through dreams or illness, (for example, an ancestor may be a drummer and wants his sons to inherit the art). If this revelation is ignored or remains undiagnosed, the ancestor/ancestress enforces the message through the inducement of illness. In fact, most instances of mental illness among the Akan are believed to result from this phenomenon. However, this illness does not lead to death. Finally, Nsamanfo may induce illness if one of their living relatives does not name any children after them. The Nsamanfo may show displeasure by causing discomfort to newborn babies or making such babies have diarrhoea. Another important aspect which may induce illness from Nsamanfo, is improper \"burial rites\". If someone in the family is not properly buried, his/her spirit becomes angry and affects a family member. The proper burial consists of wailing, putting some of the personal belongings into the coffin, and sacrifices. Again, such discomfort or illness does not lead to death (Wandibba 1995: 121). The other causes of Sipe are spotting a python, killing a person, or killing a totemic animal. The affected family is expected to go to a diviner to find out the underlying cause and then take the required action, usually herbal medicine and sacrifice. The Akan idea of Sipe is that both humans' and animals' anger causes illness. As Roseman rightly puts it: \". ... Transgressing the rules that constitute \"normality\" awakens these souls from their state of suspended animation, whence they emerge unbound as illness\" (Roseman 1993: 130). But Sipe does not rule out the social dimension. The Akan belief is that the \"anger\" of a child's father may result in illness. Also, a severe offence by the mother against 179 the father of the child can cause the death of the child. To prolong and avoid illness, respect for the father and the paternal kin group is expected from the mother and the child. The commonest complaint in the ObosomTigare shrine is by mothers who feel that \"angry fathers\" or envious neighbours cause their children's illnesses. Whenever these patients come, Okomfo Afua Nsiah's comment is: Biribi wo mu, meaning \"there are troubles in your sickness.\" Another Sipe\u2014caused illness is breaking or transgressing taboos. The Akan observe a number of taboos and ritual prohibitions. People are prohibited from eating certain animals, both domestic and wild, as well as other foodstuffs. Whereas some of the food avoidances are specific to certain clans, others are observed on gender lines. Among the Akan, each clan has at least one food taboo. It is believed that ifa member of the clan eats a food that is forbidden the person will vomit and then becomes seriously ill. Transgression against a food taboo inevitably makes the victim suffer from some skin disease. People who are in a state of ritual impurity are also believed to bring about illness. The community avoids such people until appropriate rites are performed. In this category of people are widows, warriors who have killed people in battle, or women who have just given birth, especially to twins. It is believed that mere encounter or sharing a meal with them brings illness. Also the Akan believe there is another category of illness called Bonsam-yaadee or Obonsam caused. Obonini or Kra (infertility) is another category of illness in Akan society. The term Obonini refers to female and Kra to male. But both simply mean infertility or \"unable to germinate\". The word Obinini has two root words Obo- is a verb which means \"to make\" or to make something\", and Nini means \"male\". That is a single person who is unable to multiply, 180 produce, or increase oneself. But in another context, Obonini or Kra refers to economic and social status. It means a person who does not marry, or does not go to school, is unable to pass his/her examination, or is unable to secure a job, and so on (See Sindiga 1992). The Akan attribute the cause to Nsamanfo (spirit of living dead) who refuse to \"open the womb\" or other opportunities or avenues for a woman or man. For example, if a son/daughter marries into a sworn enemy's family, the spirits are angered and revenged by making the couple childless. Another cause of infertility is the breaching of taboos and customs. This takes many forms; for example, marrying a blood relative, however far the link is. Traditionally, the Akan trace back relationships to the founders of clans and all descendants are related to each other, as a mother, or a father, sister or brother, aunt or uncle. Marriage is not even allowed between members of different clans whose founders are brothers or cousins. If such unions occur the Akan believe children born will be physically and/or mentally handicapped or infertility will occur the wife. According to Okomfo Afua Nsiah, all infertility cases that are referred to her are \"human induced\", either through a curse, an envious person or from the victim's action and/or that of the husband or their relatives. The herbal medicine is the first line of therapy taken to remove the impurities from the womb. If the condition persists, other causes are suspected in which case she consults the oracle. Once the cause is revealed, she prescribes the most suitable therapy to the patient. Causes through human intervention call for the destruction of the spell. This therapy involves the ritual of untying the charm that is tied to the womb through sacrifices and other ritual manipulations, accompanied by herbal medicines and sometimes by some concoction with 181 the power to ward off evil. At times this operation involves the un-tying, counter-tying, re-tying and counter retying until one party gives up. If the problem is with the living dead, the curse is usually removed by replacing an animal for the offence committed or by a ritual scattering the spell. If the cause involves disregard Akyiwadee (taboo), this must cease for the therapy to be effective. A concoction of special, powerful, herbs is given to dispel the \"crime\" caused by the breach of the taboo. The struggle by a childless woman can be exasperating. All possible remedies are explored and exploited until there is no hope. As Mbiti notes: Unhappy is aman/woman who fails to get children, for whatever qualities he/she posses, this failure to bear children renders him/her a dead end of a human life on both the genealogical line and her own line since nobody from her blood will remember him/her. No one will keep him/her in constant state of personal immortality when he/she dies. Childlessness is irreparable humiliation for which there is no source of comfort in traditional life, even ifit is the husband or the wife's fault, neither is excused in the eyes of the society (Mbiti 1969: 110). 6-7 The Role of Illness The Akan religion holds the view that illness has an important role to play in the community and stresses certain spiritual functions. These functions are purgative, reformatory, and rewarding. In the purgative role, the Akan tradition holds that if a person does not behave well in the community, the spiritual agencies such as Abosom, witches, and ancestral spirits, will 182 strike him/her with illness to remove him/her from the community so that the rest might have peace. By the same token, children or people who do not heed advice are punished with sickness in order to reform them. The following case studies at Nsiakrom shrine reveal another dimension to illness. They clearly demonstrate that illness is an occasion to review and resolve problems from intrafamilial strife, unpaid debt, and breaches of marriage rules as well as long-standing grievances between lineages and clans. These functions the Western bio-medical system does not recognize. Though the Western bio-medical system in Africa has helped to improve the health conditions of the people, in some ways it has become a \"weapon\" to suppress indigenous healing practices. Pregnant women who first seek help from African traditional healers are refused treatment if they go to the Government hospital. The following is a personal testimony from a Ghanaian medical practitioner who begun to treat a native child with a horrid skin disease: I doctored it and the places were healing beautifully. But when I found that the child was wearing amulets, I told (the mother) that I could do no more for it till they were removed. But it was no use; she refused to take them off, so I put the ointment away even though the child's skin getting very much worse. Over and over again the mother begged me to cure her child. But I did not do it because of the amulet on the neck. Now, I am only too thankful I did not yield...I told her once more that I could do nothing till she gave away the medicine of the devil. Greatly to my surprise she cried, \"give me my child\". And immediately they left the hospital. The charms on the child's neck made me feel bad and gave the child to the mother. I joyfully went back to my office and sealed the ointment 183 (personal communication 1989). I witnessed a scenario where a pregnant woman in labour was refused admission in the Maternity Hospital based on the fact that she had amulets around her waist. The nurses advised that they would not attend to her until she had complied. The government of Ghana requests medical certificates from patients who have treatments from various clinics and hospitals before they are given \"Leave-pay\" from work. Those who have received treatments from traditional healers are refused these certificates. The following are cases showing how illness and treatment work to both cause and resolve social conflict in a traditional setting. The first case study involves Mr. Kwasi Mensa, district officer of the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board, and a farmer in Aboakyekrom. Mr. Kwasi Mensa, in his forties, went to Aboagyekrom as a successful district officer of the Cocoa Marketing Board with a sound educational background. The senior officers and his colleagues described him as industrious, honest, affable but firm. He was in charge of the whole Asante Akim district. Mr Kwasi Mensah's predecessor had a \"business deal\" with a certain farmer. The business deal was that the officer and the farmer jointly owned a truck that carted the cocoa produce from the villages to the district centre. They made a lot of money from this deal. But, unfortunately for the farmer, the officer was transferred. When Mr Kwasi Mensah took over and carefully examined the documents, he found this \"deal\" to be inappropriate and advised the farmer to accept cash payment for his share in the truck and leave the truck to the government. Since it was the government's policy to provide services for farmers, Mr. Kwasi felt it was good advice. But the farmer would not accept this because he was making big profits through his deal 184 with the previous officer. However, Mr K wasi Mensah went ahead and paid the farmer his share in the truck and made the necessary corrections in his files. The farmer, was dissatisfied and in an angry mood and reportedly said to him: \"Wo dee twen! (You wait and see!) Which means \"he who does not want you to live, let him also not live.\" Kwasi ignored this threat and went about his daily work. Then, a few months later, when Kwasi attended the funeral of one of his labourers in a nearby village, he felt shocks within him. His body began to shake, he felt dizzy and started sweating. He was immediately rushed to the district hospital and was discharged with two weeks' sick leave. But the day Mr. Kwasi returned to duty, the trouble started again. He consulted many physicians of the area but there was no improvement: rather it got worse. Finally, in desperate condition, he was rushed to Okomfo Afua Nsiah at Nsiakrom. As soon as Okomfo Afua Nsaih saw him, she told him that he had offended a certain farmer and that the latter had used Adubone (bad medicine) against him. Okomfo Afua Nsiah invited the farmer to the village and the case was settled. After a few months he became well and went back to work. The second case study involves a dispute between two traders in the market. Madam Adwoa Agyeiwaa was a cassava seller in the Kumasi Central Market who seriously fell sick. She was admitted at Kumasi Central Hospital for over a month without any improvement in her condition. Her mother secretly came to Nsiahkrom for an Abisa (inquiry). During the inquiry it was disclosed that the cause of her illness concerned some cassava she unlawful seized from another trader. When Madam Adwoa Agyeiwaa was brought to Okomfo Afua Nsiah, the priestess her and she admitted the offence. Okomfo Afua Nsiah arranged for the other trader to come to the village and the matter was settled. After a few weeks she recovered. 185 The third case study was a stolen \"neck-chain\". The case was between a \"Chop-bar keeper\" (restaurant keeper) at the Kumasi-Bekwai roundabout road and one of her customers. The barkeeper had put her neck-chain at the counter and it was stolen by one of her customers. According to her, the chain was very expensive and so when she could not trace it, she brought the matter to Obosom Tigare. Six months later the customer who had taken it became seriously ill and was referred to Okomfo Afua Nsiah to whom she admitted the theft. She then brought in the chain which was handed over to the owner. The \"curse\" was revoked and she became well. The fourth case study was between an old woman and her daughter about \"food\"'. The old woman swore that she would never again eat her daughter's food. After a few months the daughter fell sick and the matter was referred to Okomfo Afua Nsiah who revealed that the cause of the sickness was her mother's anger. The statement \"I will never eat your food any more\" was more than a curse. It meant that all family ties had drifted apart because what sustained the ties had been destroyed. The old mother was given a calabash of water and she poured it on the ground to revoke the statement she had made. Then the daughter became well. The Akan beliefis that there is power in the spoken word Ano a edi nkyene ne mako ye bosom, which literally means, \"the mouth which tastes salt and pepper is a deity\". The fifth case study involved a husband and wife. Madam Afua Kyerewaa suspected her spouse of engaging in extra-marital activities, a charge which he completely denied. But the woman was not satisfied and she cursed the man on Obosom Tigare: \"if the husband has been involved with that particular lady, then Obosom Tigare nkyer wo \"Obosom Tigare should get him\" any time he would meet her for sex\". After a couple of weeks the husband began to 186 experience serious headaches. He now felt he had to admit his fault. The couple then came to Obosom Tigare of Nsiakrom and the curse was revoked. The wife was \"pacified\" with an amount of C500.00 (five hundred cedis) and a piece of cloth. The Obosom T igare was also \"pacified\" and asks to avert any disaster that might befall the husband and his former girlfriend. The husband was advised to take the proper channel if he so desired to have a second wife, and not to resort to Kwasea buo (cheating). All these and many other case studies reveal that the Akan use illness not only to cause a person harm but also to readdress their personal conflicts. 187 Chapter 7 IlIness Diagnosis and Treatment 7-1 The role of the sick To the Akan, when some one becomes sick he/she acquires an entirely new set of expectations and different patterns of behaviour. As the Akan put it: \"Oyarefo to se Akwadaa, which literally means \"a sick person is a child\". One of the main criteria of illness is that the sickperson is \"incapacitated\". In the usual case, he/she has been capable of normal functioning, but illness, in some degree, makes him/her unable to carry on. The second aspect in which the child and the sick person are similar is that they are both dependent: needing and expecting to be taken care of by stronger, more \"adequate\" persons. Thus in these sense, illness is not unlike a more or less complete reversion to childhood. This \"dependency\" is also illustrated in the Akan axiom Se eka wo nanti a, na aka wo to which is literally translated \"when something touches your buttocks, it affects the whole body\", meaning that when illness strikes it affects three different entities, the victim, family, and the entire community. Also the three different entities have an important role to play in the process of treatment. This chapter examines these roles, including the healer and his/her methods of healing. The Akan view of the sick person is that he/she has privileges as well as responsibilities. The privileges and responsibilities and a change in social status are simply described as the \"sick role\" (Parson and Fox 1958). In his/her sick role the family and the community modify their 188 expectations as the sick person is viewed as weak and dependent whose illness requires great service. However the sick person does have a role play in his/her sickness. The Akan mention sick- roles in proverbs and axioms such as Obo nom aduro ma yarefo, which means, \"No one drinks a medicine for the sick person\", that is, the sick person must take it him/herself. Or the Akan axiom Wo ton wo yare wonya obi ma no to, which is translated as \"If one sells his/her illness, he/she is likely to get someone to buy\". The first role of the sick person is called \"self-care\". That is, if a person is only mildly ill and familiar with the treatment for a condition which is not considered serious, he/she usually treats him/herself. For instance, if there are simply scratches on the skin, he/she covers it with herbs. If he/she gets a mild fever he/she purchases drugs either from merchants or traders in the markets who sell a variety of medicines. Or he/she treats with a variety of widely known herbs and then waits some days to see the results. If the illness still persists then the sick person moves to the second stage known as \"non-professional healers\". When the sick person has not been able to obtain relief after several days of mild illness he/she seeks help from \"non-professional healers\". These practitioners do not charge for their services, although they generally receive gifts ifa cure results from their treatments. Their medical knowledge is picked up from personal experience. That is, when they get through particular illnesses they recommend the same treatment to the sick person. When the \"self-therapy\" and the \"non-professional healers\" have failed, the sick person consults the head of the family and the wider kin group. The head of the family observes the 189 symptoms and resorts to household treatment. The head of the family excuses the sick person from community obligations and also advises his/her own family members not to disturb him/her with any domestic burden (Sirgerist 1929, Parsons 1951). If he/she is a father/mother he/she is not to attend work or to support his/her family or to take part in decisions of his/her various groups. In the Akan tradition, the head of the family endorses all these sanctions before the chief of the village reinforces them. Akan tradition and custom require that in illness the sick person should sell his/her sickness before the family and the entire community mobilise their resources to restore health (Frankenberg 1969: 573). This is indicated in the Akan axiom Obi nom aduro ma yarefo, that is, \"no one drinks medicine for the sick person\". Another important sick role is based on the African belief in causality, Wusie biara nni ho a, gya nni asee, which is translated \"there is no smoke without fire beneath it\". Also, the Akan hold that Biribiara nsi kwa, \"everything has its because or, ne se nti, \"reason or \"cause\". The natives' concept of an orderly universe completely rules out random chance, or uncaused events. The Akan believe that individuals suffer for their misconduct. Thus, when a person 1s ill, the question most people ask is \"What has he/she done?\" The question implies that the sick person has to reflect on his/her past behaviour and confess any misdeeds in his/her life. Confession to the natives, is a statement of admission of guilt or misdeed. As Abogurin puts it: \"Confession is necessary, for it is a moment one has to admit that he/she has done what is wrong\" (Abogurin 1986: 68). The Akan religion has two types of confession, namely, \"public\" and \"private\". In the public confession, the misdeeds are confessed to the general public and the private confession is 190 mostly made known to one or two persons. Normally a victim does not have any choice, but leaves it for the deity or the general public to determine whether or not the confession should be private or public. However, if they are given choice, the victims would like private confession and the general public would prefer public confession because of the belief that an individual's misdeeds bring problem to the entire community. As Ford puts it: \"Their declaration is that all wronged persons have to confess their misdeeds in public (Forde 1960:192). Sometimes, the deity influences the type of confession. Some deities demand public confessions while others ask for private. The Akan view on confession is that when someone is sick or is unclean, it is the confession that restores health. Hence confession demands that the sick person's old clothing be taken away and replaced with new. Confession is Efi (dirt) which must be \"purged\" or \"washed\" off (Forde 1960: 210). For the sick person to recover from his/her ill heath, the confession demands minute details of the offence. For example, an adulteress will describe the circumstances, names of the partners, where, when, and how the act was committed. Apart from restoring health, without confession, the offence continually haunts the person and urges him/her to kill more before taking his/her own life. The sick person's confession of the bad conduct that the society disapproves of, reinforces the Akan traditional injunction that \"bad conduct brings sickness, everybody must live good life in order to enjoy good health\"' 7-2 The role of the Family The growth and development of families express the health of its individual members and 19] the unit as whole. Thus birth and the periods of infancy, childhood, adolescence, middle age, and old age reflect the individual's healthy progression through the life cycle within the context of the family. The family unit is successively reassembled, beginning with a unit in which one is a child, then a parent and a spouse, subsequently a grandparent and a spouse, and then possibly great grandparent as well as a spouse. In both health and sickness, the Akan hold that the human family holds responsibility to each member of the family. When one of the members of the family is sick he/she communicates with Abusua Payin (family head), then the latter consults other members. Elders are summoned who first observe if the illness can be cured with Abibi duro (native's medicine) or Aborofo duro (white man's medicine). This first stage is called the \"social palaver\". That is, the elders decide what other steps are needed to secure the diagnosis and cure. In most cases the family members prefer Abibi duro to Aborofo duro. The natives see the hospital setting as a strange place often staffed by non-natives who force alien rules which are in conflict with their traditional beliefs. As Fried] puts it: \"Traditionally hospitalisation has been viewed as desertion of the sick person by his/her family...The hospital scenes and patterns of hospital care represent isolation\" (Fried 1958: 27). The kin group shares the expenses of the treatment. The family makes plans to cater to the needs of the sick person's dependants. The family members who accompany the sick person to the treatment centre remain with the patient during the course of the treatment. They follow the ethical rules and observe the dietary taboos, either temporarily or permanently, on behalf of the patient. In other cases they participate in the cure by collecting leaves or roots from the bush 192 and prepare them for administration. As Kofi Appiah-Kubi observes, the kin group is like an \"extended patient\" (Appiah-Kubi 1981). If there is no apparent reason for the illness, and it is not serious, the elders apply their own \"family medicine\", for most families have a store of the common herbal remedies. Since many villages are remote, the natives know the herbs and roots for common ailments. If the home remedies fail, there are several types of healers the group might appeal to. The first is the herbalist, the person knowledgeable in all natural medicines. Then there is the Okomfo (diagnostician) whom we shall discuss later. There is the traditional midwife, a woman who attends childbirth but who also has skills in other family medicines, especially dealing with women's problems and children sickness. There are those who are skilled in bone setting and problems of joints, such as arthritis. Finally, there is the exorcist, popularly known as witch doctor, or Oduyerfo (medicine man). These are family remedies handed down from parent to child. This family solidarity communicates to the sick person that he/she is not alone in his/her pain and suffering, but the entire family is behind him/her. Also it eliminates Suspicion in the mind of the sick person that a family member caused the sickness. This is clearly manifested in the axiom Obi nko obi abusua nkokyee, which is translated as \"No one goes to another family to bewitch people\". The other proverb is Ofie bosea twa wo a esene oyiwan, that is, \"When a house pebble cuts, it is sharper than a blade\". Even if the cause of the patent's illness is blamed ona member of the family the matter can easily be resolved at the treatment centre. Another important role is expressed in the Akan song: Se wo wayie beba a, hwe wo 193 yarehwe mu, which is translated as \"To know whether one's funeral will be grand or not, as to when death strikes, is determined by how one's relatives care for him/her in times of illness\". When a sick person finds that there are some family members surrounding him/her it gives them a lot of encouragement. Ifa sick person thinks that his/her death is approaching, he/she tells the relatives. The sick person's relatives may also, by their conversation and questions, suggest that the sick person tell them about his/her condition. It is only when the sick person is surrounded by his/her family members that he/she announces his/her successor, and how his/her property is to be divided among his/her children. If he/ she has grown-up children, he/she commissions one of his/her relatives to look after his/her children and their mother. In sickness and in death, as well as in life and strength an Akan realises his/her sense of belonging to a family. The family solidarity persists even after the burial, for people do not abandon the bereaved. The family may appoint someone especially to offer comfort and support, perhaps by taking up residence with the family for as long as a year, until the pain of separation has eased. Death is the passage from the \"visible\" to the \"invisible\" world and it is the responsibility of the kin that the dying person has a smooth transition. The responsibility is to help the dying person die a \"good death\" and to have a \"decent burial\". To die a good death means someone will be at his/her sick bed to give the dying person water before his/her last breath. The Akan consider denial of this ritual a big disgrace on the part of the family. Another important thing is to give the deceased a decent burial. To the Akan, to die is to become a seed that could sprout again and the tears of the family members constitute the waters that are necessary for the seed to germinate. To die without proper burial means the seed will remain underground. 194 The most important role of the family in illness is to take note of whatever utterance he/she makes in the course of illness. A dying person's last words are called Nsamansew (will); they are usually equivalent to a legal will and failure to honour the express wishes of the departed is to court disaster. The Akan oral tradition quotes a case among the Ashanti where a dying man willed part of his property to his sons. After his death, according to custom, his brother succeeded to the property and refused to honour the Nsamansew. A short while later, the latter fell from a roof and subsequently died. The general belief was that his death was due to his failure to carry out his deceased brother's instructions. The next successor to the property duly gave the cocoa farm to the son to whom it had been left (see also Hoebel 1961: 229). When the sick person is a child, or the husband is affected, the burden of care falls largely on the mother or wife in the family. For instance, if the mother or wife is the family member with kidney disease, it is necessary for the husband to assume caretaker duties for the children and also to care for his wife, which often occasioned changes in family members' roles (plate # 10). Again, any side effects of the treatment of the sick affect the wife or the husband or the mother more than anybody else. Financial problems of the patient's failure to continue work and from the cost related to treatment, weigh heavily on the wife or the husband. Nonetheless, the shield that the family erects around the sick person serves to protect his/her self-image and enforces the dependency of the sick person on the family members. If the need of blood or an organ arises, it is easily solved. 195 7-3 The Role of the Okomfo If a person is very ill for a prolonged period, or is convinced that someone or something is trying to kill him/her, he/she seeks an Okomfo. Generally, people consult Akom/o for all kinds of illnesses, but those who come to Okomfo Afua Nsia are patients with critical conditions. While most patients are familiar with many causes of diseases, their main concern is the disease agents. In conversation with many of these patients, I realised that they needed answers to questions such as, \"Why should a person fall ill when he/she needs to find food for his/her family?\" Or, \"Why should a person either lose the hands or the eyes when he/she requires them to see his/ways or to get his/her wants?\" To them these questions contradict their worldview. The role of Okomfo in illness is to find out \"who?\" \"what?\" and \"why?\" To these questions Okomfo Afua Nsiah answers with three causes, namely, efficient cause, instrumental cause and ultimate cause. The efficient cause answers the question \"who does it?\" It refers to an \"agent\" that is responsible for the illness. The instrumental cause deals with the question of \"what the agent used\". This deals with material objects such as a stone, bird, metal snake, fallen tree, and many others. The Akan believe that people do not cause illness for no particular reason; there is always a reason for the act. What induces the \"agent\" to bring the illness is known as ultimate causes. Ultimate causes range from kinship to politics, and cover wide areas such inheritance, business disputes, jealousy, envy, rancour, and spite, and many others (Spiro 1966: 91). These causes are traced from the Akan concept of Sipe \"evil thought\" as I have explained in the previous chapter which stresses that Bibiara wo ne farebae, \"everything has a cause\". If 196 one does something evil to a friend and the person harbours the evil person, he/she will become sick. Sometimes the persons who are hurt use \"objects\" but at other times they do not. According to Okomfo Afua Nsiah, the difference between a \"traditional healer\" and a \"medical doctor\" is that the latter concentrates on the instrumental cause and leaves out the efficient and the ultimate causes. She explains that shivering in cold weather is the body's attempt to generate more heat in order to increase the core temperature of the body; a high fever is the body's attempt to make the environment uncomfortable for whatever is in the body. That is how the human body treats illness within. But the healer or physician has to go beyond this natural mechanism. She maintains that unexpected, or extraordinary events, or pregnancies that extend beyond one year, or persons dying from snake bite, or persons being afflicted with certain kind of disease, or persons being accidentally shot to death by a hunter, and so on, are not normal but abnormal events (Kyekye 1995: 78). In traditional Akan thinking, in order to heal someone with such an illness, the healer should find out what caused it and why? For example, \"Why did that tree fall at that particular time and kill that particular person?\" To the Akan the efficient cause is the agent who caused the accident, the instrumental cause is the tree, and the ultimate cause is that tree at that time to kill that person. The efficient cause is not necessarily the Supreme Being; it could be a human being, lesser spirits, or an ancestral spirit (see Evans-Pritchard 1937: 63) 7-4 Methods of Healing The method of treatment follows directly from the concept of the causation of illness. 197 Okomfo Afua Nsiah has two methods treatment \u2014 \"'counter-measure treatment\" and \"clinical treatment\". The counter-measure treatment involves inducing the sorcerer to undo, or to remove, evil power, to redirect the evil power, or to render it harmless. Other methods include neutralising the potency of the harmful substance or destroying it. Clinical treatment deals with isolation, administration of herbal medicine and so on. In the counter-measure treatment, if the cause of the problem is shown to be a violation of a taboo or breach of a rule of avoidance, the counter-measure treatment is ritual purification. In most purification rites, Odwan \"a sheep\" is slaughtered and the victim is smeared with its stomach contents. On the other hand, if the problem has been brought about by acurse, then the first step in the treatment is to induce the person who uttered the curse to come and participate in the rite of lifting that curse. In Akan religion ancestral spirits cause illness and suffering. I have heard Okomfo Afua Nsia in diagnosis saying: \"I have seen your trouble. Your trouble is serious. The cause of your illness, I have seen, is due to your dead father, whose spirit is complaining that you did not brew beer for him and you no longer remember him\". That is, the deceased father is angry for being neglected. The sick person then must realise his neglect of responsibility and correct the situation. If Nsamanfo (ancestor/ancestress) is the cause, the Okomfo Afua Nsiah usually advises propitiation in the form of a sacrifice or offering (Kwagwa 1934: 25). If a spirit of the ancestor/ancestress has come upon the victim, it needs a different treatment. In this case, Okomfo prescribes \"exorcism\". The priestess fumigates the ghost out of the victim's body by making the patient inhale great quantities of ill-smelling smoke and administering nausea-producing drugs so 198 that the patient will vomit the ghost; or she entices the ghost out of the victim's body by offering it aram. Another counter-measure treatment is \"transfer\" which is to inflict the patient's disease on a scapegoat, either animal, tree, or other human being. Then the patient rubs it from head to toe with clay and has it buried. It is believed that the first person who steps over the buried object contracts the disease. Usually the \"transfer\" method is used in treating epidemics. The Okomfo rubs the sick person's body with a bunch of special leaves which are believed to contain the disease and then sends them to the border of the country where they are left to rot (see Roscoe 1911: 342). If the illness is attributed to witchcraft or sorcery, Okomfo Afua Nsiah \"removes\" the evil spirits or poison and then plants more potent medicine in the patient. If a patient is accused of witchcraft, Okomfo Afua Nsiah resorts to \"trial by ordeal\". That is, the accused is declared innocent if he/she survives the ingestion of poison (Matovu 1966). If the illness is caused by Abonsam, \"demon\" the counter-measure treatment is to \"neutralise\" the demonic power. This kind of counter-measure treatment is based on the Akan belief that a person can \"increase\" or \"decrease\" his/her \"inner\" power by having the bone of a powerful animal in his/her pocket. The priestess boils the bone of Kwaberafo (a strong animal in the Akan ecological system) and asks the patient to drink and apply his/her body with the substance. I remember when I was a child of six my grandmother always put a bone of Kwabenafo into my water for bathing. I observed similar bones in Okomfo Afua Nsiah healing practices. At first I thought it was human bone, but later I was told it was an animal bone that 199 contained vestiges of the demonic powers. Another counter-measure treatment is \"seduction\". The priestess takes a bit of A tagye (no equivalent name in English, but it resembles peanut), binds it with some leaves, puts it into a small pot, and lays it at the edge of a pond for Obonsam to see and taste. If the Obonsam tastes it, is believed to leave some of its \"essence\" in the pot. Then Okomfo sets a fire in it and blows the smoke over the patient to lessen the danger of contact. Sometimes she takes the substance in the pot and rubs it over the patient's body to incorporate the very power that made him/her sick. Another \"seduction\" treatment is to exchange the soul of sick the person with that of a ram by pouring its blood into the domain of the demon and seduce it into accepting the ram instead of the victim. Another counter-measure treatment is \"redirecting\" if the cause of illness is due to poison or hatred. In the redirecting treatment the sick person may not necessarily be present, for the treatment is essentially a struggle between the healer the external force. In some cases Okomfo Afua Nsia retrieves and destroys the poison. Or she removes from the patient's body a poisonous object which a sorcerer has inserted and redirects it to him/her. At other times she augments the patient's personal power. She gives the sick person some medicine to consume into the body, such as blood, fat, pigments, fumes, powered substances, or other objects to be eaten, drunk, inhaled, rubbed, or blown into and onto the body. Another treatment is to rub or massage the patient, or to blow breath or smoke into the body. 200 7-5 Clinical Treatment The clinical treatment is not effective until the counter-measure treatment is allayed \u2014 that is, the agent has been removed before clinical treatment begins. In some cases, if the patient is cured in the counter-measure treatment, then he/she needs no clinical treatment. For the relief of the pain from headaches, fever, coughs, and sometimes pleurisy, acommon clinical treatment is \"cupping\". The priestess makes an incision over the part of the patient's body where the pain is localised. She then places the end of a cattle horn which has a small hole cut near the end to help create a vacuum over the incision. After a sufficient amount of blood has been sucked from the wound, the priestess removes the horn and shows the patient the blood that has been withdrawn. Inevitably there is some foreign substance, such as the head of a lizard, a snail, a snake or a frog in the blood which she indicates as the source of the pain. For fever the priestess uses other methods. Sometimes she cuts into a bone in the head and cauterises the area to cure her patients. For fever, a vapour bath is a common remedy. The patient is stripped naked and sits on the floor with a pot of hot embers placed beside him/her. Then the patient and the pot are covered with Kyenkyen (cloth made from a tree bark) to induce perspiration. After some minutes the cloth is removed and he/she feels well. Treatment for the more sever contagious diseases varies. In the case of leprosy, the priestess isolates the patient. For plague, after summoning the aid of Obosom T: igare, she blisters the affected parts of the victim if he/she is not in a very advanced stage. She does this by using a beetle, which when dried and made into powder is mixed with the juice of an unripe banana and applied to the sore. The blister usually appears four to six hours later. 201 For physical complaints due to illness, the priestess most commonly prescribes the use of medicine. The Akan maintain that in the case of all natural objects, such as plants, seeds, roots, leaves, stones, if one understands their behaviours, they can be used in healing. When turned into healing medicines they are classified into three main types: (1) preventive (2) destructive and (3) curative medicines. The preventive medicine is used to avoid illness; the destructive is applied to destroy evil powers and the curative medicine is for early and advanced stages of illness. The Akan traditional healers use all these methods in their practices. The non-professionals only use only preventive and curative medicines to protect or to weaken the illness. The household healers normally prescribe medicines for immunity. They mix certain concoctions and give them to their clients as immunity against illnesses such as smallpox, chickenpox, measles, coughs and others ailments. The patients either take medicine internally or smear them over their bodies for protection. Other family healers who are Moslems give preventive medicines to their household members in the form of amulets made into compact shapes. Some of these amulets are put around the neck and others are worn around the waist or the anklet. According to tradition, the family-Moslem healers gave the amulets as preventive medicine and later they turned to curative medicine. That is, when they accomplished the cure, people continued to wear them to ward off future occurrences. Now, amulets have become commodities sold in the markets. Market woman sell these amulets, claiming that they possess supernatural powers which do not need any additional medicine to be effective (Sempanji 1966: 67). But all these healers are limited in scope. People who seek help and guidance from Okomfo Afua Nsiah are patients who are mostly 202 concerned about the causative agents. Her role is to remove these agents before further misfortune occurs. The Akan believe that illness is sometimes a sign of greater misfortune and the afflicted is more concerned with the future than with immediate discomfort. The patients do not bother much about the symptoms but are very much concerned with the agent. Some patients even request the priestess to neglect the treatment of illness and concentrate on the cause. These patients believe that it is only when the wishes of the agent are met, or the poison of the witch or sorcerer is rendered impotent, or some other action is taken, that clinical treatment becomes necessary. This insistence does not give Okomfo Afua Nsiah the freedom to do what she thinks it is the right thing to do at a particular time. That responsibility rests with the patient. This sometimes results in deaths which could have been easily prevented. However, for these deaths, the priestess is not held responsible. The bereaved family blames themselves for the death. Sometimes they claim that the patient has not followed the treatment prescribed, or that a longer time is needed for the priestess's treatment to have been effective. From my personal observation, clients have considerable say in the whole treatment process. Almost universally throughout Africa, the Obosom is expected to know the nature of the problem about which it is being consulted, and clients are generally not required to divulge them explicitly a priori. Ifa client is not satisfied with one diviner, he/she may consult another to test the veracity of the previous Obosom. This is the common practice among the Akan. Thus, the good reputation of Okomfo is not automatic; rather it depends on his/her success in making correct diagnoses. Peter Fry noticed among the Zezuru of Zimbabwe that, based on poor performance, mediums may be discredited \"either totally, partially, or situationally\". Fry relates 203 the case of a famous medium who was totally discredited because he used the prestige of his position to commit incest and to induce a client to do the same. Another medium was partially discredited because he claimed to be possessed by a spirit which \"belonged\" to some other diviner. What Fry notes is very common among the Akan. Clients may suspect that the Okomfo has feigned a trance, in which case, the client will refuse to accept the oracle. The point is that all these possibilities are means of ensuring that the practice of divination remains honest and ethical (Fry 1976: 42). Akan know that there are fraudulent, dishonest, and unscrupulous Akomfo who engage in divination, not as a service, but primarily as a means of making living. Thus there is code of ethics binding on the work of Akomfo. With regard to the amount of sacrifice required and service charges rendered for divination, the general rule is reasonableness. It is expected that there will be a marked difference between what the Obosom demands of arich person in the way of sacrifice or offering and what it will require of a poor person. It is generally thought professionally unethical \"to take advantage of a sick person or charge strangers more than a relative\" (Bascom 1969: 76). In Akan society Akomfo are publicly known but are not generally distinguished from the rest of the society except during actual divination. In other African societies, however, they are clearly marked by their mode of dress or some sacred behaviour. In either case, what fundamentally characterises them is their liminal state. As agents of communication between the everyday and mystical worlds, at least temporarily at the height of divination process, they belong to both. 204 7-6 The Role of the Community In the Akan tradition it is impossible for any person to live outside community. The community is not only a necessary condition for human existence, but it is the community that defines humanity. This idea is expressed in a proverb Onipa firi soro besi a, as, \"when a man/woman descends from above, he/she descends into a human society\". Another proverb says Onipa na ma onipa ye Onipa, which means \"it is human beings who help human beings to be human\". Or, Obi yie ye iri obi, which is also translated as \"the prosperity [well-being] of a man or a woman depends upon his or her fellow men/women\". To the natives, a person is not a palm tree that he/she should be complete or self-sufficient. Consequently, the individual inevitably requires the succour and relationships of others in order to realise or satisfy basic needs. The individual needs the community, and the community also needs the individual. The community plays an important role in the well being, illness, and death of individual. When someone is sick the community expects that every member visits the sick person from time to time to express his/her sympathy and sorrow. If the sick person has a family, some of the members take his/her children to their homes and feed them. Others supply foodstuff when they return from their farms. If the sick person dies, the community takes it upon themselves to find the person who caused it. The community feels it is incumbent on them to identify the guilty party and to exact revenge. Normally, when such a situation arises, the community suspects the deceased family members first before it turns to the deceased's enemies. The community expects that the Saman (ghost) of the deceased will disclose the murders, 205 either by revealing their names to a member in the family in a dream or through spirit possession during burial rites. When neither happens, the community institutes what the Akan called Funusoa \"detective test\". In this test every family member is expected to touch the corpse's toe; should the guilty person do so, the body will twitch. (One man remarked that \"it might also defecate\"). Or the community ties a cord on the corpse's finger to a rafter and each family member is expected either to loop his/her thumb with the index finger around it or place an extended hand beneath it. If the cord vibrates, it is interpreted that this person is the one who caused the death and he/she is asked to confess. I observed one such community role on Wednesday April 1, 1998 when Madam Adwoa Agyeiwaa and the community's delegation came to Obosom Tigare in Nsiakrom to find out whether it was true that she killed her own son. After some incantations Okomfo Afua Nsiah declared that it was Madam Adwoa Agyeiwaa who had killed her own son. When the community's delegation confronted her she admitted that she killed him. Then the community members put one bottle of Schnapps, a full piece of calico, a brass pan, a knife, an unspecified amount of money, in a brass pan which Agyeiwaa was to carry on her head for a procession in the street. The community calls this the \"hooting ceremony\" where people literally hoot at the accused. The community and shrine functionaries mention the person's name and the nature of the offence, then they praise the cult for \"catching\" the victim and plead with the cult to pardon and release the victim from further evil deeds. The \"hooting ceremony\" shame! What did you do, shame! You killed your own son, shame! Tigare, by your grace, we have apprehended her, shame! Tigare, sorry for her, shame! Tigare, forgive her, she has run Good-for-nothing, shame! She killed with cleverness, shame! Tigare, she for shelter, shame! are right, shame! Tigare, well done! Well done! (Translated into English by the author). It was pointed out to me later that the purpose of this hooting was to bring the misdeeds of Madam Adwoa Agyeiwaa to the notice of the public and to purify her before incorporating her again into the community. It is obvious that together with confessions, the hooting provides an emotional catharsis, for it is the community's potent way to liquidate guilt and anxiety. When illness ends in death, the community contributes to the expenses of the deceased. The chief and the elders appoint young members to sit at the table and receive donations from the members of the community. After the donations the chief and the elders meet the deceased 207 family and render accounts. This is done to ensure that the deceased's family does not incur debt. If the deceased is an adult, the community appoints someone to succeed him/her. Finally, a word is needed about community dance, an extremely important element of ritual in divination, healing, and reconciliation. Community dancing accompanies almost every event that affirms life \u2014 birth, initiation, marriage, induction into an age set, and so on. There is also dancing to ward off destructive forces during illness and death in which context dance has a therapeutic power. The destructive forces of illness are \"shooed away' so to speak, by the dance. Community dancing gives added strength in a mystical way to whatever medicines are employed to attain health and wholeness. In the Akan tradition, community dancing in illness is a way of rejecting anger and embracing communion. 7-7 Traditional Herbal Therapy Herbal therapy is one of the most talked about issues in Akan society. The Akan believe that their herbal knowledge comes from the Odomankoma Obodee to the Abosom and Nsamanfo through dreams, visions, spirit possession, from there it is passed on from generation to generation. Each family has a healer who deals with minor cases. For example, a woman with a gynaecological problem first seeks help from her family healer before she goes outside. Medicinal plant materials used by the family are largely drawn from the homestead, the home garden and from fallow, thickets and woodlands within a locus of three kilometre radius from the village. Live fences provide niches and habitats for many important herbs. Family healers collect from neighbours' fields without any restrictions or hindrance. Okomfo Afua Nsiah 208 does not travel long distances to obtain her herbs (plate # 12). There are friends and relatives who supply her from areas where these herbs are grown. The ones she can't get from friends she purchases from reputable markets. Most medicinal herbs are poisonous if taken in large quantities. Therefore, the dosage is prepared with great care and accuracy. Okomfo Afua Nsiah, with long experience in this, helps to estimate the dosage. It is believed that climatic conditions also have effects on the herbs. There are certain times of the seasons in which they lose their potency but others in which they gain it. Herbal medicines are prepared and administered in different ways. They may be given in the form of infusion, liquid extraction, or hot decoction of the whole herb or its plants, such as flowers, seeds, leaves, root, bark or gum. The whole plant or its parts may be soaked in water overnight or pounded and boiled. The extraction or decoction thus obtained may be given internally or applied externally as a poultice to the affected part such as a skin eruption, a lesion, or a wound. A summary of different methods used is given below: An infusion of leaves is used as a bath. Leaves are passed through stem and vapour is inhaled to cure fever. Leaves are heated over a fire and applied as a poultice over the wound, rashes or enlarged glands. Leaves are powdered with water or crushed and applied as a poultice. Leaves are chewed and the juice swallowed. Leaves are boiled and the decoction is drunk to cure various ailments Leaves are smoked. 209 Leaves are employed as an inhalant for fever. The vapour from crushed leaves is inhaled for the treatment of fever. Roots are pounded and the juice is rubbed as an antidote to general poisoning. Roots are boiled and decoction taken. Roots are pounded and mixed with other ingredients taken. Roots are cooked with meat or vegetable and the soup is drunk Roots are seeped in cold water and the liquid is drunk. Roots are grounded to powder and applied on wounds and rashes. Young branches are roasted and chewed. Seeds are ground and mixed with vegetable fat and the paste is applied on sores. Fruits are crushed and soaked in hot water overnight and drunk. Bulb-paste is prepared from the bulk and is used to dress wounds or earache. The Milky latex or sap of some herbs is used for the treatment of hookworm. The bark of both stem and roots is usually used in the same way as the leaves, as mentioned above. Although all parts of plants are often used in the preparation of different decoctions, popular practice gives preference to roots. Traditional healers who harvest the roots return the soil to cover the remaining roots. The Akan believe that if the hole is left open, one's enemy could later remove the remaining roots and use these to bewitch the user. There are strong taboos against the cutting and planting of certain sacred trees. For example, certain sacred trees, such as Odum barima (Chlorophora excelsa) and Homa kyem (E. abyssinica) are not supposed to be planted. 210 They generally regenerate on their own. It is a taboo to cut such trees. Odum barima is only cut on full awareness of the chief and his elders of the village, following an appropriate sacrificial offering to the tree. This is the traditional practice that forestalls the overuse of medicinal plants in the Akan land. 211 Chapter 8 Religion and Social Control 8-1 Religion and Social control What is social control? What is the mechanism of social control? Does religion play any role in social control? These are the question this chapter addresses. Social control affects individual behaviour through the use of power or application of sanctions. Valued behaviour is rewarded and negative behaviour is punished. Parson's general definition is that social control is regulation by the group of its members. To him social control is to regulate the behaviour of adults who might be motivated to nonconformity (Parson 1952). LaPiere defines social control as mediation between the personal and specific situation in which the individual acts. In his view, relatively small and intimate groups which operate on the individual's desires for social status such that the group exercises social control (La Peire 1954). Roucek defines social control as a plan in which individuals are taught, persuaded, compelled, to conform to the life values of a group. To him, social control operates on three levels. On the first level, the society controls the conduct of its members, on the second level a group determines the conduct of another group, and on the third level individuals informally influence the responses of others (Roucek 1956). The Akan's model, which involves the chief and his/her elders, the heads of family, and the peer groups,) seems to agree with Roucek's definition. 212 Malinowski argues that \"reciprocity\" is the key foundation of moral values and social control. He explains that there are three kinds of reciprocity \u2014 \"generalised\", \"balanced\" and \"negative\". Generalised reciprocity is to give something but expect nothing in return, such as when parents feed and educate their children. Negative reciprocity is to take away from someone without expecting return at all, such as when a thief steals someone's car. F inally, balance reciprocity is to transfer something of equal value between two parties (Malinowski 1926). Generalized and balanced reciprocity achieves social control. This is an important part of Akan society, but there is more to it than this. Radcliffe-Brown argues that social control is a reaction to a mode of behaviour which is approved or disapproved. If the mode of behaviour is approved then it is \"positively reinforced\"; if, on the other hand, it is disapproved it is \"negatively reinforced\". The \"positive\", is what one should do and the \"negative\", is what one should not. It implies that something unpleasant will happen if one does what one ought not to (Radcliffe-Brown 195 5). There is something of this in the Akan model, but as with Malinowski, there is more to it than this In an African context, Wilson's view is that social behaviour is not connected with any religion and that peoples' moral values are not religious values (Wilson 1974). Gyekye supports this view saying that African traditional religion is not a revealed religion, and therefore, has no religious values. He concludes that what the Akan call religious values are derived from individuals personal experiences rather than supernatural (Gyekye 1995). McVeigh reiterates that African ideas of \"right\" and \"wrong\" are derived from traditional customs. The \"right\" is what the community approves and the \"wrong\" is what which is disapproved. As he puts it, \"the right 213 builds up and the wrong tears it\" (McVeigh 1975). By contrast, Dickson holds that in African societies social order and religion go together - no social order exists without religion. Idowu supports Dickson when he states that Yoruba morality is the fruit of religion (Idowu 1962). Similarly, Parrinder observes that morality is bound up with religion and that social order comes from the Creator. What is ethically good must also be ontologically good (Parrinder 1961). Busia's view is that it is only religion that defines moral duties for the members of the group and that standards, loyalties, obligations, and reciprocities in Africa societies are rooted in religion\" (Busia 1951). I side with the scholars who argue that West African social order is derived from religion based on my personal experience in Nsiakrom. During my fieldwork I parked my car in the centre of village, sometimes unlocked, but nobody stole anything from it (plate # 13). Also, a lady's bag was left in the street for three days till the owner came back to pick it. During an interview with Okomfo Afua Nsiah, she explained why: \"The Abosom are more powerful in controlling crimes than policemen/women\". She concluded, \"nobody steals in the village because of the cult\". As Williamson says: \"In African traditional society, Onyame, Abosom, Asase Yaa and various divinities are invoked to enforced social control\" (Williamson 1955). Among the Akan sacred and secular means of social control are interwoven. The Akan have variety mechanisms of social control which include Abosom, actual punishment, shame, guilt, isolation, cursing, and reward. Others are gossip, respect, reciprocity, hexing, etc. 214 8-2 Abosom Escapelessness One of the mechanisms of social control is embedded in the Akan proverb, Se onipa ahu woa Onyame ahu wo, which means, \"if nobody sees, Onyame sees everything\" - \"Onyame here is a generic term which stands for all deities\". In this chapter I will use Abosom instead of Onyame. The idea of Onyame ahu wo carries the notion of the \"escapelessness\" of the natives' deities. The Akan belief is that the Abosom are everywhere and see everything that human beings do or are doing. Also they are impartial and judge people according to their deeds. Sometimes human actions or thoughts are hidden, but the Abosom see what is in the dark. Associated with these attributes is the belief that the Abosom strike wrongdoers at random or in the act. Since the Akan believe that Abosom strike whenever there is a violation of the moral code, this keeps people away from committing crimes. The belief in the \"escapelessness\" of the Abosom creates in the mind of the offenders a sense of \"helplessness\". In order words, they feel like being imprisoned. Until they confess and the community sets their misdeeds free, there is no hope for prosperity in life. Abel's treatise on the \"Scientific Explanation for Vodoo Death\" clearly describes the situation: A Brazilian Indian condemned and sentenced by a so-called medicine man is helpless against his emotional response to his pronouncement \u2014 and dies, sometimes within hours. In Africa, a young Negro unknowingly eats the banned wild hen. On discovering his 'crime' he trembles, is overcome by fear and dies in 24 hours. In New Zealand, a Maori woman eats fruits that she later learns have come from a taboo place; her chief has been profaned, and by noon the next day, she is dead. In Australia, a witch doctor 215 points a bone at a man; believing nothing can save him, the man prepares to die; he can be saved only if the witch doctor is forced to remove the charm (Abel 1976: 81). The situation in Akan society is similar. A person falls sick, a diviner is consulted, he/she reveals that the victim has offended some ancestor or Obosom, or a neighbour, and unless some redemptive ritual is performed the person might die. I interviewed some patients in Nsiakrom who voluntarily confessed to having been caught by Abosom. The first patient said to me that he believed his sickness was an offence against a girl friend and that he had been hexed by her. Unless a redemptive ritual was performed, he would die. Another person who had abnormal pains declared that the cult had shot him and unless the bullets were removed, he would die. These examples illustrate how the Akan belief in \"escapelessnes\" makes them conform to the norms of the society. The belief in \"escapelessness\" of Abosom motivates practitioners and non- practitioners to lead upright life. 8-3 Yesee-yesee (gossip) Another mechanism of social control is what the Akan called Yese yese (gossip). It is based on the Akan philosophy Wo ka ntam gu amena mua epue abonten, which literally means, \"If one swears an oath into a pit, it comes out.\" In other words, whatever one does in the community, it will one day come out. And when people know, they will gossip about it. As matter of fact, Yese-yesee literally means a \"rumour\", and when it is applied to wrongdoing it causes shame. Yese yese is a powerful means of social control because of the fear that one's wrongdoing will be known to the public, and cause other people to have bad opinions of him/her. 216 These bad opinions are communicated through the community through gossip. Another aspect is that people gossip about someone when they perceive that the person has let the group down by behaving ina way that is disloyal to the group and its guidelines. The Akan notion of gossip disapproves of the person's behaviour and brings him/her back on track. The fact that the community will gossip about whatever it hears or sees keeps people on track. The embarrassment accompanied is usually sufficient to keep people in line. Feedee (shame) is another form of social control. Another term is Animguase. Animguase or Fadee means that a person has stepped out of line and questioned the legitimacy of a person's very existence: Fadee ne wuo dee fayam wuo, which means \"to die is better than to be shamed\". Another proverb is Animuguase emfata Okaniba, which means \"An Akan must not live with disgrace; better to die than to face embarrassment\". The Akan society employs Feedee asa form of social control for no one wants to be disgraced. When one does something wrong, it not only affects the person as an individual, but the whole community, for the family is disgraced. For example, if the Obosom Tigare catches a witch, both the person and his/her family are ashamed. In order not to shame the community or the family every Akan tries to comport him/herself properly. Animuguase (guilt) as a mechanism of social control takes many forms such as insults, hooting. During fieldwork I witnessed an \"open insult\" about the local chief and his elders in one of the villages. The chief was verbally abused for various acts of inefficiency and some of his elders were disgraced for committing incest. Other open insults take the form of \"posters\", such as when a picture of a woman who had stolen some fish was put up on the street. Animguase and 217 Fedee are effective means of social control. As Turnbull put it: In traditional society, widespread throughout A frica, ridicule and threats of exile are as effective in the maintenance of law and order and of conformity of behaviour as are the ghastly forms of physical punishment that we have often grossly exaggerated and held to be the sole basis of tribal authority in Africa (Turnbull 1962: 62). Nwonkro (singing and dancing) is another forms of social control. Young boys and girls may informally gather news and make up songs about individuals who have committed the offence, using his/her name in singing and dancing. But they also sing to praise those who perform good deeds or show good behaviour. Besides singing, the young girls use Aso (a game exclusively played by young girls) to announce the names of members of the community who have achieved something significant. Another mechanism of social control is Ntamkan (oath swearing/curses). People who are found to have problems in life are called upon to swear that they put a stop to them - for example, a drunkard. Also, when a person recovers from sickness, he/she swears not to commits the misdeed again. Disobedient children may take an oath or swear and pronounce curses on themselves that they will change their way of life. Parents sometimes pronounce oaths against their children. Moreover, oaths may be made that no one reveals certain secrets about the community. For example, the Akan chief takes an oath not to reveal \"people's origin\". As Hoebel, quoting the Chief linguist talking to the Ashanti King during his inducting, says: Tell him that we do not wish that he should disclose the origin of any person. And after his investiture, the King of Ashanti swore to the people. I ask your permission...to speak 218 the forbidden oath of Thursday... Today you have elected me... if I do not listen to the advise of my elders; if I make war upon them, if [ run away from battle, then I have violated the oath. Hoebel concludes that violation of this oath means distoolment (impeachment) (Hoebel 1961: 243). The importance of this oath taking is that if the person betrays the dignity expected of him/her, he/she is removed form the office or the community. Indeed, Mendonsa argues that the primary purpose of oath taking is social control: The primary weapon of this oath taking is that when person breaks it, he/she is drawn into a sequence of events that demand public confession and retribution through sacrifice to the community, both the living and the dead. The right to disgrace someone publicly is a common means of social control, which rests with an office holder, but he is also constrained in his abuse of that right by public opinion (Mendonsa 1982: 189). 8-4 Asuo-twa (expulsion) Asuo-twa in Akan language means \"expulsion\", and is another form of social control. In social control Asuo-twa means loss of place or rights in the ancestral cult. It is also the loss of protection by the Abosom and the ancestors both on earth and in the land of the dead, and loss of rights to reincarnation. Again it means the loss of economic, political, and other social privileges deriving from the lineage head. In matter of fact, the person who is expelled is declared to be no longer a member of the community, but he/she is now \"a stranger on the land'. He/she is 219 excluded from social intercourse. As he/she has lost his/her lineage privileges no one speaks to him/her and is not even allowed to take a firebrand from any family member's hearth. This extreme form of Asuo-twa is invoked against the most serious offences in the society, such as incest or culpable homicide. The lesser form of Asuo-twa is \"denunciation\", which involves loss of right to land use, the imposition of fines or special duties, or refusal to help in marriage payments. For example, a clan may denounce a family member when he/she misbehaves in public and brings disgrace to the clan. Or a family may disinherit a member who dissipates family wealth. The effect of the denunciation is not so much the physical hardship involved, as disgrace to one's self and his/her offspring. Another form of social control is \"retaliation\". In Akan society, when one man/woman commits an offence against another, the community allows the latter to express him/herself in any words possible, to the extent of insulting the offender. When he/she has freely said all that needs to be said, the community expects that he/she will no longer harbour ill feelings against the offender. In some cases, the community imposes a fine on the offender. In other instances the offended may require eggs, fowl, or cash to obtain satisfaction. Those who receive such satisfaction feel that they have no further grounds for ill feeling. \"Indemnification\" is another form of Akan social control. It is a means of giving something and receiving something back. In Akan traditional thought indemnity is like \"exchange\" but it goes deeper than that. For example, during the initiation of a marriage, an exchange of gifts and services takes place at several stages between the two groups. These 220 nuptials gifts, Ti nsa (a drink, often alcohol) and Aseda (thank offering), are seen as economic transfers in the way in which one would buy a slave. The Akan's view on marriage is that taking the woman from her parents is regarded as an invasion of the rights of her family and kin. Hence they must receive an indemnity. Marriage is not regarded by the Akanasa capture of the bride by force, or a purchase of bride under contract, but rather an indemnity which bears some similarity to that of a purchase. Turnbull explains that bride price also gives dignity to the woman and her family: What pride can a woman have if her husband does not think highly enough of her to give her parents a gift of many goats as a token of her esteem and thrust? And what safety and happiness can the parents feel if they can not say, 'Our son-in-law has given us so many goats he must intend to treat our daughter well and care for her, for no man could afford to lose so much wealth'? (Turnbull 1962: 79) The social control aspect is that no one should enter another person's household and pick a wife without offering something in return. 8-5 Abaso-bo (rewarding) The Abasobo as a means of social control involves praising and honouring certain people in the community. At certain times of the year the communities hold a \"durbar\" and give \"'titles\"' and \"names\" to individuals who have distinguished themselves in humane acts, bravery, etc. by giving them gifts of lands and other property. For example, the King of Ashanti awarded the late Lt. Colonel A. A. Afrifa the title Okatakyie when he overthrew the government. The tittle 221 Okatakyie means \"one who deserves to be carried shoulder-high'\". Sometimes these \"good people\" are appointed state elders or chiefs with hereditary privileges. Parents may also give gifts to a good reliable child \u2014 i.e., to a reliable, honest son may be given land or a gun, or canoe and fishing net, the dowry for a wife: to a good, respectful daughter may be given heavy and priceless beads, and wares for trading. Nsa-woso (reciprocity) is another powerful mechanism of social control in Akan communities. Its operation is based on the principle: \"If behave (or do not behave) in a certain way toward someone else, that person will behave (or not behave) toward me in the same way. If I want another person to treat me well, I need to treat that person well\". The Akan expression \"If I scratch your back, you also should scratch mine\" reflects this. It is not simply a \"golden rule, which stresses the fact that \"we are to treat others as we would like to be treated\". The Akan believe that there is order in nature, and if human beings live in peace with one another in this order there will be everlasting peace. Reciprocity is a kind of bargaining for good treatment and is the glue that maintains friendships and even entire social units together. It is a mechanism for social control in the home. Parents take good care of their children with the hope when they grow old the latter will also take care of them. Reciprocity here extends to giving and receiving intangibles such as love, respect, and obedience in order to receive favour. Duabo is another mechanism of social control in Akan society. Farmers and artisans bury medicine in their farms and pray to \"catch\" people who steal from their farms or workshops. Sometimes they indicate the type of punishment which is to be inflicted on those who steal such 222 as \"immobility\"or \"sickness\" or \"death\". In the former case, the thief will remain in the farm until the owner arrives; in the latter; the thief may be able to leave but later falls sick. The thief remains sick if he/she fails to confess. During my fieldwork a case was reported in one of Ghana's Daily papers that a thief was unable to leave the farm after stealing farm produce, and for three days he was weeding in the farm under the spell of the curse. After the third day the compassionate farmer pleaded with the spell to allow the thief to leave and it did. 8-6 Nkafem (hexing) A similar method of social control is what the Akan called \"hexing\". Hexing involves the placement of a spell on a valuable object to prevent thieves from stealing it. This entails a procedure different from the others. One of my informants took me to his orange grove and I saw a small black bag visibly placed on the branch of a tree which he said was a \"hexing\" to protect it against trespassers. In some case the hexing is buried in the ground and when a thief comes to the place to steal, it is believed he/she will come face to face with a cobra. If the thief drops the items and escapes he/she is not punished. But if, on the other hand, the thief insists on carrying any of the items away then the cobra will chase him/her or will strike. A culprit may be transfixed on the spot until the owner of the farm or barn arrives. Or the culprit may experience sudden malfunctions of the parts of his/her body; such as a finger contorting and remaining contorted thereafter. Or his/her mouth may be twisted sideways, or his/her arms paralysed. There are other hexes called \"chastity hexes\" applied by married couples to unfaithful partners. Chasity hexes are of various kinds with different methods. One of the methods is to 223 detach an axehead from its handle, apply the spell to the handle, and then secretly place it in the person's living room. It is believed that when the unfaithful wife meets his/her paramour and ina process of lovemaking, the magical axe and the handle will automatically lodge together and transfer to the couple. Both of them remain helpless in its spell until the husband arrives. Other hexes are in the form of magical substances which are incised, swallowed, or injected into the body. It is believed that if a husband injects them into his body and has sex with the wife thereafter, she will not be able to have sex with any other man. I was told that most of the men who practice this do it in secret without the knowledge of their wives. However, there are some husbands who, in order to deter their wives from extra-marital flirtation, inform them that they have been hexed. 8-7 Akan-kwanso (Akan path) The term Akan-kwanso is literally translated as the \"Akan way of life\". The Akan-kwanso sees every human life as a journey on the same road, beginning from \"birth\" and ending with \"death\". On this journey \"birth\" begins in the underworld, and \"death\" is seen as going back to rejoin the ancestors. The Akan Kwan has four well-defined stages: childhood, youth, adulthood and old age and each stage of the road is thought of as a necessary, slow, preparation for the next. It is believed that each passage is an abrupt step, fraught with the danger of losing one's way. All these \"rites of passage\" (Rattary 1927)- birth, puberty, initiation, marriage and death - are perilous occasions in which the whole clan or village must mobilize all forces to keep the \"pilgrim\" firmly on the road. The Akan Kwan is more than a \"rite of passage\"; itis a mechanism 224 of social control. That is, it is the society's collective means of ensuring that each person is on the correct path. The first Akan-kwan method of social control is to set individual's feet on \"the Akan road\". The traditional custom demands that when a baby is born, he/she may not see the sun for one week. Within these seven days of seclusion, the mother only goes to the wash room to wash or to bathe the baby. The mother and the baby do not go out because the latter has not yet begun his/her journey. It is on the eighth day that the baby starts the journey. Birth rites are strictly a clan affair, and are exclusively in the hands of the child's own clan. It is the father's clan that takes charge. These rites teach the child that he/she owes his/her existence and allegiance to the two clans. The marriage of his/her parents has in fact been a joining of their two clans, and he/she owes a special obligation to both, as they do to him/her. Before dawn on the eighth day, the father's mother arrives at the home of her daughter-in- law along with all her own daughters to give the child a name. The child is strapped in traditional beads and its grandmother takes him/her outdoors to the rising of the sun. The grandmother raises him/her up as an offering to the \"Father sun\". Thus the world accepts him/her and as long as he/she stays on the road he/she will remain an important and necessary part of the world. Then the grandmother takes the child in to give him/her a name. In the naming, the grandmother drops water and wine three times, calling the particular name the child is to bear. The water and the alcohol symbolise truth, and the truth is either water or alcohol. The second Akan-kwan mechanism of social control is to introduce the boys and girls to pain and suffering in life. This is to tell the youth that life can be serious and is often hard, being 225 full of responsibilities that cannot be evaded and hardships that must be borne. Above all, the youth are taught the great lesson of the clan- all for one and one for all in the sense of \"giving as well as receiving\". The boys and girls learn to help in the fields in planting and harvesting and go out gathering firewood and foodstuffs. Boys help build new houses for family and girls pound fufu, fetch water from the spring, and take care of the young babies. Cooking and pounding fufu are the chief tasks for girls and they show that they are already industrious women, ready for marriage and are able to run households. Puberty rites are also forms of social control. Akwasi Sarpong expresses the religious importance attached to these rituals: [fan Ashanti were asked why girls' nubility rites are performed, he would instinctively reply that the ancestors instituted them, and failure to comply with their injunctions would infuriate them. To some, they very question would sound preposterous because it implies a suggestion that a girl could not have children without satisfying her ancestors. If pressed further, they cite instances of punishment which the ancestors visited some people who slighted in this matter (Sarpong 1977:12). To be declared ineligible for this rite in consequence of unchasity is an abomination. As the tradition abhors premarital sex, the proof of a girl's chastity in her virginity is one of the Akan values. The evidence of virginity is traditionally not accepted upon mere verbal declaration. It must be ascertained. The mode of certification, which takes place on the eve of the ceremony, consists in an ordeal administered by the senior kinsmen. The ordeal entails the testing of the hymen by the attempted insertion of a boiled egg into the vagina. The vaginal 226 cavities of the girls who have lost their virginity are receptive of the egg, in which case such girls are declared unchaste and are ridiculed. The others are then qualified to proceed through ceremony. The fourth mechanism of social control is marriage. In marriage, as in birth, the youths must once again put themselves in the hands of the clan. The Akan hold the view that marriage is not a simple ceremony, but a series of ceremonies spreading over a year. Two clans enter into a very special relationship which is marked by an exchange of gifts and services. Such matters are not treated lightly as the mere whims of two couples. There is all the solemnity and protocol that goes with the making of international treaties. The boy's relatives bring her gifts of clothing and other raw materials, for which she gives them Kunu nnuane (husband meals) The last mechanism of social control is \"Old age\". The Akan do not have any ceremony to mark the passage into old age, though a ripe old age is always prayed for in all ceremonies. By living a long enough a man/woman becomes a clan mother/father automatically and assumes the duties and responsibilities of the head of the family. As the heads of the family, they are to be respected and honoured. The heads of the family, in turn, must respect others by being controlled and patient. The greatest insult is to someone is that their children disgrace them in public by arguing, or refusing to do as they are told. Such a person who has no regard for others is ignored. The elders \"turn their backs\" to him/her. Death from old age is considered the most natural and proper way to die, for it means that the traveller on \"the road\" has truly completed his/her preordained journey and is therefore fully prepared for the final passage. The spirit has reached its goal, pauses there like the sun at its 227 solace, and now returns to the underworld. The Akan's attitude towards the environment is another mechanism of social control. The Akan see their environment as world alive and full of purposes, like themselves. This is not only animals and plants but also sun and moon, wind and clouds, water and soil, and indeed everything that has any importance in their lives. Each of these living beings has its own duties and responsibilities towards all others, just the Akan people have their daily duties towards each other. As long as each plays its proper role, the world will proceed in its appointed way. In the whole co-operative commonwealth of nature, the heaviest responsibility rests on human beings. Before the Akan will allow any project in their environment, the whole village must carefully consider its ultimate effect on the Akan way of life. If there seems to be no real conflict, they will allow it. They do not live to experiment with such important matters, for they know that it is very difficult to cancel a development once it is firmly establish in people's habits and people have come to depend on its benefits. During my fieldwork, the Member of Parliament for the area met the people of Nsiakrom and proposed to install pipe borne water. The village council carefully considered the proposal, recognised its advantages, and turned it down. F or, they said, who could assure them that this easy way of getting water merely by turning on a tap would not simply result in springs drying up'? Were not the urban centres suffering from water shortages even though water was as free as air? And would the pumps not make the Akan dependent on outside capital to buy them, and on fuel to run them? They did not want to risk destroying their traditional self-sufficiency and with it their ability to protect their way of life. 228 The Akan of the area react to such proposals and temptations not of blind conservatism, but out of reasoned and deliberate choice. They decide that it is better to accept the physical hardships to which they are used rather than give up the satisfactions that go with them. It was better, they feel to climb mountains with heavy jars of water, to grow cocoyam and plantain, to pound /ufu in mortals, than to sacrifice the ceremonies and traditions that gave that heavy labour its ample meanings and rewards. They feel they do not have to chase after happiness and success in new ways, since they are already happy and successful. They are, and want to remain, in balance with the world about them. This emphasis on \"control\" in the best sense of the word, then, rests on indigenous religion precepts today embodied in the Obosom Tigare of Nsiakrom cult. 229 Chapter 9 Conclusion The finding of this study is that the Obosom Tigare continues to play an important role in the life of the contemporary Akan society despite external influences such as Christianity and Western materialism. In support of this conclusion J have outlined the key points in the thesis in this chapter under five main sub-topics. The first subtopic deals with the Obosom Tigare as a new religious movement, the next followed by the issue of \"syncretism\". F inally I discuss the methodology by which I approached the subject and the issue of \"the indigenous perspective\". 9-1 Obosom Tigare as brought the Obosom Tigare from Niapara, in the Upper region, to the Ashanti region of Ghana in the mid 1930's. But today, Obosom T igare of Nsiakrom is different from that of Niapara. In its village of origin it is a \"local deity\" which serves the needs of few agricultural communities, but in Nsiakrom it has become a \"religious movement\" with adherents from all Regions of Ghana as well as the whole West Coast of Africa. The movement is centred on the founder Nana Afua Nsiah who is popularly known as Awo Yaa (Sweet Mother). She is one of the two surviving children of eight born of the late Madam Akua Sarpomaa and the late Opayin Osei Kwadwo. When Afua Nsiah reached marriageable age, several potential husbands were discouraged because of her family history. However, Opayin Fosu married her at the age of 19. Immediately after the marriage customary 230 rites, Opayin Fosu sought permission from the parents to travel with her to Niapara and pledged themselves to Bosom Tigare. While serving the cult in Niagara, the Bosom Tiger possessed her and she underwent training as a full-time priestess. After her training she first settled in Kumawu where she began practising the priestcraft before she finally moved to Patriansa, her hometown. When her supplicants grew in numbers they left Patriansa and founded the village, which is now, called Nsiakrom. Though the people in the community call her \"founder\", Okomfo Afua Nsiah does accept the title in totality. Her view is that no human being can \"found\" a deity. It is rather the Abosom who reveal themselves to human beings and stay with them. However the natives see her as the founder. First and foremost, he/she is the one to whom the adherents look as their spiritual guide. She is the one who prescribes rules and religious traditions for the community. She is an exemplar, an archetype, and a mediator between them and Obosom Tigare (See Van de Leeuw 1938: 651). Nsiakrom is about fifty-eight miles from Kumasi the regional capital, and eight miles from Konongo, the head of the Asante Akim District. It is a small village of about a hundred houses, with a population of nearly one thousand. Some of the people in the Asante Akim District call Nsiakrom an Ayaresaba bea, which means a \"healing village\". Others call it Ahomegyebea, which means a \"place of relief\" or a \"resting place\". But both Ayaresabea Ohomgyebea carry the same meaning: a \"place of hospitality-- equivalent to the Greek idea of Xenodochia which means an accommodation for travellers (Gask & Todd 1953). But the Akan idea of \"hospitality\" is deeper than \"a resting place\". It means a \"place for people who, for 231 whatever reason, have no homes, a religious community for the poor and the sick. Now all the residents of Nsiakrom are the sick, the formerly sick, and their relatives. When someone is sick and healed, he/she is expected to join the labour force and support others. He/she is given a piece of land to farm. He/she does not pay rent. The village has a school which began with an enrolment of about forty pupils but now has grown to about four hundred. Okomfo Afua Nsiah is solely responsible for the education of the pupils. She buys uniforms, textbooks, and provides other educational requirements for the school. Also she pays the teachers' salaries. She has built a clinic for the village and all the residents receive treatment free-of-charge. She pays the nurse in-charge. The main concern of Obosom Tigare is Nkwahosan wholeness of life or health. When I asked Okyeame Badu (cult linguist) his definition of \"the religion of Nsiakrom\", he replied: \"Nkwahosan concerns a man/woman who is sick and searching for healing'. He explained that the NAwahosan is not an individual affair, but a community one. For when an individual is sick, it is the whole community that is sick. Similarly, when an individual is healed, it is the whole community that is healed. That is, \"the sickness of an individual is acommunal malaise; the real healing requires the re-establishment of right relations\" (Both 1978: 91). The Obosom Tigare movement is holistic, because its primary focus is on the human being as situated within his/her environment. But there is hierarchy. As Obiechina puts it: \"Man is the centre of the traditional universe. ..because he is able to regulate his relationship with the gods and the ancestors and to manipulate the immanent occult of nature\" (Obiechina 1975: 38). There are two more important features about this Akan indigenous movement. On the one 232 hand, it is not very different from the Old Akan Abosom. It upholds the same religious and medicinal values. On the one hand, it is very different from Old Abosom (Turner 1978: 7) because it is not concerned with Akan tradition religion per se, but is a \"reform\" of Akan religious beliefs which have been severely damaged by western materialism, Christianity, and Islam. It is a reaction to the great changes that are taking place in Akan society and it has emerged to develop a new form of religion. As Turner puts it: We say 'neo-pagan' because we are not concerned with African traditional or pagan religions as such, but only with those new forms that have appeared as part of the reaction to the great changes occurring in African life in our period. Those who have felt the disturbing effects of the contact with Western culture and religion, and have seen their own sanctions and unity being undermined, have sometimes sought to develop new forms of the old religion (Turner 1978: 7). The Obosom Tigare has borrowed elements from Western culture, Christianity, and Islam, but never altered its essential \"pagan\" values. It has also borrowed from the \"old Abosom\" elements into its practices to form the \"Akan indigenous movement\". As Turnbull has rightly described: \"Customs are frequently borrowed and adapted, and this will in effect create mutual bonds where none existed before. They may be loosed at first, but they will pave way eventual assimilation\" (Turnbull 1962: 249). The Akan indigenous movement is a final court of justice and powerful force for the \"discovery\" and \"recovery\" of things lost in Akan culture. It wards off \"evil\" and prevents \"witchcraft\" attacks. It satisfies practical human needs, and deals with new social problems. 233 According to members of the group, the cult provides personal identity, security, and courage. It allays anxiety, fear, tension, and stress. It helps individuals cope with life and face human dilemmas with comfort and confidence. It contributes to emotional integration both on individual and social levels. In other words, it offers a holistic self-conception in a culture where the diffusion of personal identity has left many people lost, confused, and afraid. Another important function of this Akan indigenous religious movement is that it validates Akan cultural values by enforcing social, ethical norms, enforces natives' ideologies, and sanctifies an \"African way of life\". Unlike a Christian religious movement, which forces one to break away from his/her traditional religious and cultural values, the Obosom Tigare movement endorses the members' previous lifestyle. It validates the members' family religious backgrounds. It is a tool for Akan cultural survival. It explains what Akan religious beliefs stand for. 9-2 Persistence of Akan Religion Agawu (1995) maintains that since Africans are increasingly making commitments to Christianity, Islam, and Western technology, African traditional religions will soon be wiped out. It is true that Africans generally are facing many challenges. But African traditional religions continue to play an important role in the life of the African people. Folklores are still alive in the African culture and day-to-day life. They were never out of fashion but only went \"underground\" as a result of the misinterpretation of African culture and thought in secular oriented society. How the traditional Africans view the world, the metaphysical world with its spirits beings and 234 forces, how they view cause of things, what is truth to them, what is quality of life---all these and more predominate in contemporary African life. Wherever an Akan goes, he/she believes that the Abosom's spiritual forces follow him/her, and he/she calls upon them to bless or curse them in his/her endeavours. For example, when President Clinton of the United States arrived at Kotoka Airport in 1998, the government of Ghana invited the State traditional priest, Ga Wulomo, to pour libation to the Abosom for having safely brought him to Ghana. Before he left the country the same person prayed to the Abosom to give Clinton prosperity in life. The Abosom's taboos are respected in Akan society (Sarpong 1986: 7) and breaking them is still a very serious matter. As one of my informants said: Breaking a taboo is not less a crime than shooting a local king. No Akan is set free because of ignorance of their taboos. Every Akan believes that when the Abosom get angry and strike, the effects are not only on the offender but also the whole community. Hence each person in the community is a watchdog of the Abosom taboos. In the Akan world of today, all communities observe the sacred days. Friday is the sacred day of Asase Yaa/Afua and farmers abstain from going to their farms. Similarly, Tuesday is a sacred day of Bosompo, the Obosom of the sea; fishermen do not go fishing. Although there has been a decline in activity of the Akom/fo and in the propitiation of the deities throughout the Akan area, nevertheless, Akan religious practices continue to be relatively strong. It is not only in Ghana where the indigenous religions are still strong. Other African tribal groups are also holding fast to their religions. The Yoruba people have many traditional festivals 235 in honour of the divinities in Yoruba land such as Obatala, Orunmila, Sango, Esu, Oya, Orisa- oko and Saponna which bind them together. As Abimbola puts it: Foreign religions and modern trends have not been able to relegate traditional religion to the status of thing of the past. The religion is as relevant and meaningful to a good number of the Yoruba, Muslims, and Christians alike in contemporary Yorubaland as it was in the pre- Islamic and Christian era (Abimbola 1991: 58). Ejizu argues that traditional answers to the question of human suffering are so deeply entrenched in the Igbo psyche that their beliefs are not easily replaced by Christianity, Islam and Western materialism. He explains that although Christianity appears to have displaced their religion in some areas, it still commands the loyalty of many. Ejizu concludes: No doubt, Igbo religion is down, but not out in contemporary Igbo religious scene. In spite of the devastating effect of Christianity and western culture and civilisation, the traditional religious culture is far from being an anachronism. Rather, it continues to be the potential factor and a living institution for a faithful remnant in the system (Ejizu 1986: 148). The Catholic bishops of Southern Nigeria warned recently of the danger of conversion involving only a light coating of Christianity which masks a continued respect for and acceptance of the traditional religion and its practices. In a pastoral letter they remarked: Christianity has made an impact in our society, there is real increase of numbers. Some discernible changes have been made in personalities, but the extent of such changes must not be exaggerated. There is abundance evidence to show the prevalence of superstitious 236 native customs, and beliefs as well as materialism under a thin veneer of Christianity among many of our Christians (Catholic Bishops Pastoral Letter, 1986: 11-12). A similar observation by Ikenga-Metu confirms that devotion to the indigenous religion is not simply on the part of some distraught remnant of society. In Nigeria, beliefin oganje or abiku (evil spirits which reincarnate repeated in children) are still firmly held). Rituals to exorcise them are openly made by Christians and traditionalists, the educated and the uneducated alike. Consultations of oracles and divination are widely practised especially to discover causes of the death of relatives, causes of illness, and to identify thieves, witches and sorcerers (Ikenga-Metu 198&: 272). Damuah looks at the trend in a positive light, The time has come when the African intellectual must take a new look and help to resuscitate Traditional African Religion so that she can take her right place in the struggle for liberation and self determination. The fact that she has been able to survive despite the encroachments of Christianity and Islam, is an indication that there is something in the tradition which God wants to preserve (Damuah 1971: 126). Asare Opoku says that the encounter between the Akan religion and the outside world has brought many changes in the traditional Akan outlook toward the world by planting in them other religious ideas, but their influences are but a thin veneer. He concludes that the new religions are a \"supplement\" rather than a \"replacement\" of the traditional religion (Asare Opoku 1982: 73). The Abosom continue to possess people and their festivals are still held. I observed one 237 such festival in Techiman in March 1990. The Techiman Apoo festival is an annual eleven-day celebration, originated at Manso, the ancient capital of the Bono Kingdom. This festival allows every person resident in Techiman Traditional State, without regard to class, creed, ethnic group, or race, eleven days of liberty to lampoon, in the form of songs and proverbs. The songs are meant to bring out the faults and malpractices of any other person, including those in authority. On the other hand, they also sing in appreciation of their achievements and encourage them. During this period itis strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and Musuoyie (misfortune) in the state. After all personal grudges, faults, and hatreds are sung and spoken out amicably, the end result is renewed peace and harmony among the Techiman inhabitants; the Sumsum (spirit) of the state 1s cleansed after all unspoken and interpersonal bitterness is voiced. Within the Abusua (matrilineage) conflict may result in witchcraft accusations. Conflicts between non-relatives may lead to accusations of Aduto (the use of harmful medicine). The indigenous traditional religion functions in all of these situations with mechanisms which make it possible to resolve such conflicts. The Asase Yaa (spirit of the earth) plays an important role in the morality of the Akan, for it forbids certain offences that are believed to be taboos, such as the spilling of human blood, incest, suicide, and cohabitation in the forest. Whenever human blood is spilled on Asase Yaa, the community performs sacrifices to appease her in order to avert calamities that would befall the entire community. Furthermore, Asase Yaa is a keen upholder of truth, and whenever the veracity of a statement is in doubt, the person who made it would be challenged to touch the tip 238 of his/her tongue with some soil to prove that he/she is telling the truth. There has been a decline in the activity of the priests/priestesses and in the propitiation of deities throughout the Akan area. Nevertheless, the Abosom religious practices continue to be relatively strong. In Asante Akim District, for example, there are frequent drumming, dancing, and public ceremonies for the Abosom. The usual pleas for health, protection and fecundity are still made. But there has been an increasing emphasis on aids and nostrums to meet the needs of the modern world. Traditional charms to aid the traveller are now used by drivers and passengers on lorries. One priest claimed that he provided a charm to make people invisible to a place. A medicine formerly used to \"tie the tongue\" of an opponent in a dispute heard in the traditional manner before a chief is sometimes used by plaintiff or defendant in adjudication before the government court. | saw graduate students in Nsiakrom who came to request assistance to develop acumen or to pass their final examinations. It was reported to me that one deity was particularly efficacious in causing the soccer teams from other towns to fumble when playing with her home team. Propitiation of the ancestors and the Abosom so that they will grant good crops or good fishing continues. Lorry and taxis drivers seek aids in securing fares; young men request help in getting jobs in the urban areas; farmers request deities to assist about the high price of cocoa; and traders ask the deities to help in buying and selling of manufactured goods. It is also held that the Abosom powers and priests/priestesses play a role in the contemporary political situation in Ghana. 239 9-3 Persistence of Indigenous Medical Practices. The Akan indigenous medical practices continue to exist because they are based on certain persisting cultural assumptions. It begins at the household level, where family members possess a great deal of information on the diagnosis and treatment of common symptoms. Beyond the family there exist a whole range of specialists, herbalists, diviners, bone setters and accredited experts on different conditions, such as psychiatric illness and women and children's ailments (Bannerman 1982: 1815). Many indigenous medical practitioners are deeply involved in the maintenance of social order and in preserving cultural institutions. They help the patient to live at peace with his/her family, clan, village, tribe and him/herself. Such healers have a broad social role to play and are more community oriented than the typical modern, Western style, clinician. The therapy purveyed by traditional practitioners is not limited to drugs or herbs; it frequently involves spiritual rituals and regulations of diet and behaviour. The indigenous people handle their medical problems in a particular way. They relate to their own worldview, traditions, values, and institutions which have developed over time. (Fabrega 1975). They have their own disease aetiologies, medical terminologies and classifications, and a whole range of pharmacopoeia. The peoples' beliefs and response to disease and illness are, therefore, not static but change with time. In Akan indigenous practice, disease and misfortune are regarded as having socio- religious foundations. Consequently, the healing process goes beyond mere description of the disease symptoms, to discover its deep-seated causes and subsequent ways of preventing illness. 240 Although the classification is somewhat simplistic the causes they recognize are complex. These are human-caused and supernatural-caused, and traditional healers who in Akan villages treat diseases attribute illness and misfortune to both the natural and the supernatural. These traditional healers \"symbolize the hopes of the society; hopes for good health, protection and security from evil forces, prosperity and good fortune. And ritual cleansing when harm or impurities have been contracted\" (Mbiti 1969: 167). Therefore the traditional healer is a moral person who charges affordable fees and inspires trust among the citizenry. The traditional healers have various specialisations; there are herbalists, diviners, seers, spiritualists, traditional surgeons and birth attendants among others. A person may have one or more specialisation; their knowledge and skills are based on years of careful empirical observations. The greatest advantage of Akan traditional medicine is its holistic approach to medical problems and misfortunes whereby both organic and psychological attributes of disease or illness are considered together. Indigenous medical practices still persist because of this holistic approach. I will cite a few case studies to illustrate my point. On 22 July, 1998, a woman came to Obosom Tigare with the complaint that she had been married for six years but had no child. She had been under the care of many physicians and had more than twenty medical examinations. Also she had attended many Christian healing services but all had failed. Okomfo Afua Nsia prescribed the appropriate rites and applied a herbal treatment. For nearly three months she continued to report in and use different herbal preparations. By the time I left Nsiakrom she was five months pregnant. 241 A woman who had married for three years without a child left her spouse and married another. A year after the second marriage there was still no child and so the second husband took her to Obosom Tigare. She reported that during her whole married life she had never missed her period and had taken every advantage of medical advice and treatment but none had proved successful. Her first visit to the shrine was in February 1990. Okomfo Afua Nsiah gave her medical treatment and assured her that the month of February would be the last month for her regular menstruation. Four months later she came to the shrine with a four-month old pregnancy. The third case study was a twenty-eight year woman whose breasts was the size of an eight-year-old girl. She was unable to menstruate because of the immaturity of the mammary glands. Okomfo Afua Nsiah took her through some herbal treatments. After a few years she developed full breasts and was given in marriage. She is now married with four children. I participated in the treatment of diseases during my fieldwork. Internal diseases are normally treated with alcoholic drinks prepared from herbs, roots, and tree-barks. Cases of impotency in men are corrected with preparations mixed with Akpeteshi (local strong gin). Chest and throat complaints succumb to certain roots, herbs and tree-barks; so do venereal diseases. Eye troubles, earaches, headaches and colds are treated with herbal preparations applied to the eye, ear, or nose drops. Sores, rashes, muscular complaints and varicose veins are treated with smears of herbal preparations. All minor health problems do not need divination except serious cases. It is true that the introduction of new drugs, the development of psychiatry, preventive medicine, and the use of modern technology have revolutionised and challenged traditional 242 medicine; but traditional medical practices still persist. The persistence is due to the traditional medical method, which does not rest so much in its material aspects, as in its spiritual ones which are important both to the healer and the patient. Also, Akan traditional medical practices view health as a balanced relationship between the supernatural, the human being, and the environment. The environment is not merely a geographically location, but an environment charged with mystical forces. 9-4 Syncretism As noted already, some Akan development planners and other professionals (including some foreigners) tend to think of tradition as a way of life to be overcome if there is to be progress and development. What such a view fails to recognize is that tradition suits the social, psychological, and other needs of the participants in the society. The tradition may be great source of comfort to Ghanaians undergoing rapid cultural change, providing security and continuity in an unpredictable, changing world; traditional methods are genuine functioning systems whereas the same cannot as yet be said of the modern/urban alternative. During the course of my work as a research anthropologist I interviewed patients about their views on biomedicine and ethnomedicine. Most patients regard ethnomedicine as distinctly African and biomedicine as purely scientific. They expressed the belief that biomedicine is superior to ethnomedicine in \"immediate cause diseases\" such as cholera, bilharzia, and venereal diseases, but that ethnomedicine is superior to biomedicine in \"ultimate cause diseases\" such as sorcery, or loss of ancestral protection. 243 The Akan frequently utilize both ethnomedicine and biomedicine simultaneously for the same episode of illness or at different times for different illnesses (Alexander 1985). People go to biomedical facilities when they believe that an illness is naturalistic. On the other hand, people turn to traditional healers when they conceive an illness to be caused by human or Supra-human forces. Whatever the case, the Akan are quite flexible in seeking treatment. Ampofo and Johnson-Romauld state it in the following way: The African peoples believe in traditional medicine and it is not uncommon to see patients in hospitals permitting themselves to be treated by modern medicine during the day and having recourse to the recipes of traditional medicine at night (Ampofo and Johnson-Romauld 1978: 51). As argued in Chapter 8, such behaviour is probably motivated by a desire to maximise one's chances of regaining health especially in view of conflicting symptoms of naturalistic and human or supra-human induced illness. Formal collaboration has already been established in some government hospitals in Ghana. The Berekum hospital has been co-operating with the Seidu Sabbi Herbal Clinic in a nearby village, and recently initiated training opportunities for highly responsive indigenous healers. The Dormaa Presbyterian Primary Health Care Programme has a Ghanaian field coordinator who was trained at the Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine. In the past year 45 indigenous healers in Dormaa District have taken part in training sessions (Warren 1986: 85). It is not only Ghana that is moving toward the integration of both traditional and western 244 systems, but other parts of the world are doing the same. China has fully integrated traditional medicine (acupuncture and herbalist) with modern medicine (Western-trained physicians, nurses and so forth) (see Faubder and Luukkanien 1972; Sidel 1972a), and this integration has seen significant gains in infectious-disease control, the eradication of famine and malnutrition, and greater distribution in maternal child-health/family-planning services in urban and rural areas. In the United States, Navaho people have integrated traditional healers to treat tuberculosis and this has expanded their general health services (Adair 1963; Deuschle and Adair 1960: 887). Bilingual Navaho men and women have been trained and worked in clinics and as nurses on reservations. As a result, there has been an increase in the use of health facilities and a decrease in deaths from tuberculosis. In Guyana the indigenous traditional religion plays an important role in the life of the people. Here, Kali Cult healing practices have been integrated with Western medicine (Singer and Arron 1967: 8). In Nigeria, Yoruba healers, especially Onisegun (herbalists) provide both traditional and non-traditional methods which help to prevent unwanted pregnancies. For example, the Lagos Ministry of Health and Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria have been training some Yoruba herbalists to help in modern family programs (Green 1979: 114). The Board, which comprises both traditional healers and scientifically trained professionals, organises and designs training workshops. There are other traditional healers working (Leighton 1963) in some government hospitals who \"divine\" causes of the illness and recommend the type of treatment to doctors (Lambo 1971: 200). Akan indigenous practitioners have several other important advantages in the health 245 programs over western-trained health personnel. The indigenous healers are accessible, affordable, and culturally appropriate and acceptable, thereby fulfilling the major criteria for effective service delivery. They have credibility as well as respect and prestige in local Akan communities; otherwise people would not seek their advice and pay for their services (Twumasi 1979: 242). Patients feel comfortable going to them because they make little distinction between body, mind, and spirit in therapy; rather, the whole person is treated. The holistic perspective of the Akan indigenous healers has led to considerable insi ght and success in treating a wide variety of illnesses that have a psychosomatic component. It is clearly advantageous to develop collaborative health care programs with healers who have their own source of income rather than with \"locally chosen volunteers\" who often lack any sort of health care interest or background, regular cash income, or at least credibility as health advisors in their own communities. Perhaps the most powerful argument in favor of collaborative programs is that the number of Western trained personnel, the number of clinics and hospitals in rural areas, and the amount of money available to the ministry of health in Ghana is inadequate to meet existing needs. Ghana's population is growing at rate of between 2.5 and 4% annually which requires a corresponding increase in medical personnel and facilities just to maintain current inadequate levels of services (Bannerman 1982). Furthermore the recent scourge of AIDS promises to tax health budgets and personnel to an unprecedented degree. Thus economic and manpower arguments in favour of collaboration can only become stronger in years to come (Good 1988). In view of all these factors, it would seem that if the cooperation of indigenous 246 practitioners can be enlisted in public health programs, there will be marked improvement in public health. Akan indigenous healers already enjoy prestige in their local communities, and collaboration with physicians or government officials bestows a respectability and recognition on the biomedical sector as well as the indigenous sector. Twumasi explains that for integration to take place the rivalry between the two systems and the subjugation of one system to the other must end. He concludes that traditional medicine in Akan society cannot easily be replaced by Western medicine, for the former is composed of ideas, beliefs, and practices pertaining not to medicine alone, but to religion as well. Nor will Akan traditional religion and its medical system replace biomedicine because of the success of the latter; instead the two must evolve into coexistence based on complementarily of function (T'wumasi 1979: 242). My position is that the present system in Ghana needs the contribution of Akan religion to solve her problems. Ghana should no longer exist with the belief that more police will stop crime, more school buildings and teachers will make children brilliant, and more hospitals and doctors will make society healthier. Constructive methods of bridging the gap between traditional medicine and scientific medicine are essential steps toward achieving both individual and social goals. I look forward to the eventual development of a syncretistic system that combines the best features of biomedicine and traditional medicine to better serve human needs (Green E. & Makhubu 1984). 247 9-5 Methodology Sitting in a library reading even good books on Akan religion is not an adequate method by which to study a religion based on oral communication. The best way to understand Akan religion is to get \"inside\" it and the community. From \"reading\" one learns about the religion, but not the essence. One understands the essence by \"listening\", \"looking\", and \"participating\". As the Luba scholar Kantanga-Tshitenge says: \"The primary method for understanding traditional culture, including religion, is that of listening to elders\" (see Kantanga-Tshiteng 1969). Placid Tempels holds a similar view when he says: \"A real understanding of traditional knowledge comes through such listening. One learns more by listening than by pursuing systematic investigation\" (Tempels 1959: 29). \"Listening\" obviously requires familiarity with the language. While something can be understood through translation, it is a barrier to the kind of immediate communication required for the receiving of tradition. The researcher not only needs a technical mastery of the language, but he/she must also have a \"feel\" for the way in which it is used. One of the most important axioms I learned from my collaborators was, Wo nsa da mu yendi ngya wo, which means, \"If your hand is in the dish, you cannot be left out\". Putting your hand in the dish means \"participation\". \"Listening to the elders\" from the indigenous point of view, is itself a participation which is central to the religion of the Akan. When an outsider is allowed to listen to elders, he/she not only learns about the religion, but to a certain extent he/she becomes a participant it. Participation in the indigenous interpretation, is not \"a man show', but is \"a collective show. Participation insists that an observer should not base his/her interpretation 248 or judgement solely on his/her own cultural assumptions and point of view. Rather, he/she should attempt to understand the people's behaviour from within their own cultural and religious values. Participation also means establishing a relationship with the people in the community. By establishing a relationship with the people in the community, the researcher or the outsider moves from the level of Ohoho (stranger) to Kuromani (citizen). As Kuromani the researcher gains a better opportunity to learn about people's feelings, experiences fears, and motivations. Also, as Kuromani he/she avoids the misinformation and misinterpretation that flow from indirect association. It is through Kuromani that one establishes \"authority\" and \"evidence\". The \"evidence\" and \"authority\" of my study are based on two years fieldwork at Nsiakrom in which I suspended my personal Christian religious beliefs and entered the society as a local Akan, attempting to represent the views of informants as faithfully as possible. For two years I became a Kuromani member of this community and recognised Nsiakrom as my second home. As a member of the community, I participated in the community's \"weekly communal labour', attended funerals and all other community activities. I learned how to make baskets, mats, and to hoe in the farm. On some occasions, I accompanied the young men hunting for animals and birds. On most afternoons I went with the young men to tap palm wine (plate # 14). Indeed I acquired most of my information during palm wine drinking. That was the time we exchanged views and shared experiences. I fetched water from the river and cooked my own food. I joined the elders in the community to settle some of the village's disputes. During ceremonial days, I participated in the 249 drumming, singing, and sometimes accompanied the young men to the bush to search for herbal medicines. Through these activities I acquired better understanding of how knowledge is gained through participation. As Jackson says: \"Knowledge belongs to the world of our social existence, not just to the world of academe\" (Jackson 1989: 9). In my field studies I \"took my informants seriously\" treating them as collaborators not as objects, and this helped me to gain a deep respect for their religion and culture (see Turner 1996 for an example of the result of this approach). The visual method of learning by \"seeing\" helped me to comprehend religion in the \"raw\", that is, to look at what people did as well as what people said and thus come to terms with religion as it is lived. Also it helped me to go beyond the mere description of behaviour and the recording of statements. Being a native myself, I became fully integrated in the life of the community and this experience brought trust and opened up many aspects of the religion which had not been revealed to \"outsiders\". Moreover, my familiarity with the natives' language inspired confidence in the people and made it easier for me to collect materials. As an Akan I did not need an interpreter in my conversations and interviews, nor permission to participate in the religious activities, and thus avoided problems of mediated interpretation. To pursue the degree of participation as a methodology, one needs to have an \"open mind\" but not an \"empty mind\". The \"empty mind\" is to be totally without prejudice, that is, to be like an infant, without knowledge. The \"open mind' is to enter the study with some assumptions in mind and to move forward from these assumptions. In other words, it is not to remove or discard what we already know, but to use this in such way that it does not undermine 250 either the researcher's perception or the perceptions of the practitioners. In this sense the approach is consistent with what Jackson calls \"radical empiricism\", which includes personal reflection as well as ethnographic description. As he says: Unlike traditional empiricism, which draws a definite boundary between observer and observed, between method and object, radical empiricism denies the validity of such cuts and makes the interplay between these domains the focus of its interest (Jackson 1989: 3). The degree of integration achieved here is reflected in the way I have expressed myself in this thesis, with observations in the form of proverbs, axioms, idioms, folktales, and phrases which convey the meaning of the practitioners themselves. My key informants were the \"elders\" of the community such as Okomfo Afua Nsiah, the founder of the movement, Okyeame Badu, the chief linguist, and other priests and priestesses. I also \"conversed\" with some ex-members of the movements for their side of the story so as to bring balance to my \"insider's\" account. There were no rules and restrictions on who could or could not participate in the conversations, and I paid a great deal of attention to those whose views represent the community as whole and not just simply those of the ruling class. In this respect, I relied very much on the \"elders\" for my information, for in indigenous forms, knowledge of the elders is true knowledge. As Eliot puts it: \"We younger ones do not know; it is the elders who know\" (Eliot 1975: 38). Tradition is that on which people can rely; as one of the characters in Achebe's Arrow of God puts it: \"We know that a father does not speak falsely to his son\" (Achebe 1969: 17). Knowledge is a \"power\" which is received by each 251 generation from its ancestors. As Tempels puts it: \"If it were not for the elders. ..the young would no longer know how to live: they would have neither customs, laws, nor wisdom\" (Tempels 1959: 29). Throughout this study one fact stands out with unmistakable clearness: that is, Obosom Tigare is vital and absolutely indispensable to the Akan. With socio-economic changes taking place now in Ghana, the power of this knowledge to sustain people is indispensable to their future. 252 BIBLIOGRAPHY Abel, E.L. 1976. \"Scientific Explanation for Voodoo Deaths\" in FATE Research Magazine, December Issue pp. 81-87.
