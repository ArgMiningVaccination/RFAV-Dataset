Goethean Science shows with crystal clarity how we can know the consciousness we're living in and transcend it. The Goethean Science Study Group, having recently complete The Light Course by Rudolf Steiner, is moving into a more directly spiritual-scientific domain in pursuit of an esoteric study of the nature of matter (among other things) through a study of the lecture-cycle The World of the Senses and The World of the Spirit. DATES: The study group takes place at 7:15 PM on the second and fourth Mondays of each month. During the pandemic, the study group is conducted using zoom. LOCATION: 120 Kenneth Street. Open to everybody. CONTACT: David Eyes at [831-419-5581](tel:831-419-5581) or use this [ contact form](/goethean-science-study-group-information-request/). THE SANTA CRUZ SOPHIA GROUP The Santa Cruz Sophia group was initiated in the early part of the 21st century from an impulse derived from a conference in Los Angeles at which Joya and Luigi Morelli met several members of local branches (Los Angeles and San Diego) who had been exploring Rudolf Steiner's views on the reality, development and fostering of Anthroposophia and the Divine Feminine which he felt was so important to connect with in our epoch. The next year both Daniel Bittleston and JoyaBirns presented at larger LA conference on this theme. This included studies of Ancient Mystery Streams as well as modern Western Esotericism. Elizabeth Sevison, from San Diego Branch gave Joya her inspired verse for our group to support this important aspect of Spiritual Science, up until that time mostly overlooked worldwide. Much of our Sophia Group study has been lectures and books written by Rudolf Steiner but also works from other anthroposophists as well as non anthroposophists. We've derived inspiration from the likes of Mannfred Schmit Brabant, Virginia Sease, Joan Almon and Joan Allen, all who have visited in Santa Cruz over the years. Joan Allen personally visited our Sophia Group, kindly sharing with us her 40-year struggles with the Foundation Stone (which we were studying at the time). Since the early 2000s we have met and studied many lecture series, books, musical, historical and artistic influences, sometimes incorporating artistic activities for ourselves. Members are few but committed and we meet twice monthly (Thursday mornings) at Joya's home on the westside of SC. During the past year we studied \"The Sun Mysteries\" and are now finishing up with \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Individual and Humanity\". Next looking at \"Evil\" (a compilation of lectures by RS).

We are an eclectic group of folks with therapeutic, legal, musical and spiritual backgrounds of many stripes, recognizing the many facets of end of life caring, learning how to organize ourselves in such a way as to be able to coordinate services for community members in need of information and support in this amazing life transition we call dying. There are alternatives to the standard mainstream practices many of us are familiar with, which often are lacking in respectful, spiritual, personal elements. DATES: Every second Tuesday of the month, 7 pm LOCATION: The home of Wendy Ostrow, 188 Forrest Street.
