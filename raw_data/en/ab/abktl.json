How do these drugs work? Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin work by interfering with dividing cells and preventing an increase in the number of cancer cells. Leucovorin works by enhancing the effect of fluorouracil and strengthening fluorouracil's ability to reduce the number of cancer cells. Trastuzumab helps your immune system to interfere with how cancer cells grow and divide. INTENDED BENEFITS This therapy is being given to destroy and/or limit the growth of cancer cells in your body . This treatment may improve your current symptoms, and delay the onset of new symptoms. It may take several treatments before your doctor can judge whether or not this treatment is helping. TREATMENT SUMMARY How are these drugs given? Your treatment plan consists of 9 chemotherapy cycles given every 2 weeks followed by 7 cycles of trastuzumab given every three weeks. Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and trastuzumab are given directly into the vein (IV). You will receive oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin and trastuzumab at the clinic by a chemotherapy nurse on the first day of treatment for one day only . You will then be given an additional dose of fluorouracil over 46 hours, or 2 days, using a disposable infusion device called an INFUSOR\u00ae or \"baby bottle\". The infus ion device delivers the fluorouracil slowly and continuously to your body over the 46 hour time period. Please see a copy of \"Your INFUSOR\u00ae - A Guide for Patients\", available through your chemotherapy nurse. The infus ion device is connected to your veins by either a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC Line) or a PORT -A-CATH\u00ae. If using a PICC line, this is inserted in your upper arm. If using a PORT- A-CATH\u00ae, this is inserted under the skin of the chest using local freez ing. The insertion would be done several days before your treatment starts and would be removed once the treatment program is finished. BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFOXT 1/9 Developed: 1 Feb 2019 Revised: 1 Feb 2020 The chemotherapy nurse will connect the infus ion device to your IV site at the clinic and then you can go home while y our treatment is delivered over the 2 days. You may return to the clinic after 2 days for the nurse to disconnect the infus ion device, or you will be instructed how to disconnect yourself at home. Some people may be instructed to go to their local hospit al to be disconnected, or may have a home care nurse provide this service, if available. You will then have a two week rest period. This two week period of time is called a \"cycle\". Each treatment will take about 5 1/2 hours . This includes a 60 minute observation time following trastuzumab infusion, to ensure that the drug does not cause any infusion related side effects. If your body does not experience any infusion related side effects, the observation time may be shortened to only 30 minutes, as dete rmined by your chemotherapy nurse. The treatment time also includes a dressing change if you have a PICC line. If you have a PORT- A-CATH\u00ae, a dressing change is not needed, so your treatment will take less time. Your first treatment will probably take lon ger, as the nurse will review information on the chemotherapy drugs and infus ion device with you. The calendar below outlines your overall treatment plan. Chemotherapy cycles - C Y C L E 1 DATE TREATMENT PLAN Week 1 oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil and trastuzumab IV x 1 day fluorouracil infusion x 46 hours, starting on day 1 Week 2 no treatment C Y C L E S 2-9 DATE TREATMENT PLAN Week 1 oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil and trastuzumab IV x 1 day fluorouracil infusion x 46 hours, starting on day 1 Week 2 no treatment Trastuzumab cycles - Single agent 7 cycles (total of 16 trastuzumab Cycles) C Y C L E S 10-16 DA TE TREATMENT PLAN Week 1 trastuzumab on Day 1 Week 2 no treatment Week 3 no treatment Treatment may continue as long as you are benefiting from it and not having too many side effects, as determined by your oncologist . BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFOXT 2/9 Developed: 1 Feb 2019 Revised: 1 Feb 2020 What will happen when I get my drugs? A blood test is done each cycle, on or before the first day of each cycle. The dose and timing of your chemotherapy may be changed based on your blood counts and/or other side effects. A test to determine how well your heart is working, called a \"MUGA\" scan, will be done at the beginning of treatment. The dose and timing of your chemotherapy may be changed based on your test results and/or other side effects. SIDE EFFECTS AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM Unexpected and unlikely side effects can occur with any drug treatment . The ones listed below are particularly important for you to be aware of as they are directly related to the common actions of the drugs in your treatment plan. Your doctor will review the risks of treatment and possible side effects with you before starting treatment. The chemotherapy nurse will review possible side effects of the drugs and how to manage those side effects with you on the day you receive your first treatment. SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS DURING TREATMENT MANAGEMENT Tell your nurse if you feel like you have difficulty breathing or swallowing during or immediately after your oxaliplatin infusion. This may occur rarely. These symptoms will disappear in a few hours, and may not require trea tment. If you have these symptoms with a 2 -hour infusion, your next treatment may be given over 6 hours. Allergic reactions may very rarely occur. Signs of an allergic reaction are dizziness, feeling faint, confusion, shortness of breath, and wheezing. This may occur immediately or several hours after receiving the drugs. It can occur after the first dose, or after many doses. Tell your nurse if this happens while you are receiving the drugs or contact your doctor immediately if this happens after you l eave the clinic. Oxaliplatin and fluorouracil will burn if it leaks under the skin. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if you feel burning, stinging, or any other change while the drug is being given. Allergic reactions to trastuzumab may rarely occur. Signs of an allergic reaction may include chills, fever, shivering, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, problems breathing, rash and weakness during the infusion. Reactions are less common with later treatments even if you have a reaction with the first treatment. Tell your nurse immediately if this happens while you are receiving trastuzumab. Your trastuzumab may be temporarily stopped and then given more slowly when restarted. You may be given other drugs to treat the reaction. Contact your oncologist immediately if this happens after you leave the clinic . BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFOXT 3/9 Developed: 1 Feb 2019 Revised: 1 Feb 2020 SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS DURING TREATMENT MANAGEMENT Nausea and vomiting may occur after your treatment and may last for 24 - 48 hours. Some people have little or no nausea. You may be given a prescription for an antinausea drug(s) to take before your chemotherapy treatment and/or at home. It is easier to prevent nausea than treat it once it has occurred, so follow directions closely. Drink plenty of liquids. Eat and drink often in small amounts. Try the ideas in Practical Tips to Help Manage Nausea* You may feel tingling or a loss of feeling in your hands, feet, nose, or throat. They may be made worse by exposure to cold . This is very common after oxaliplatin treatment. These problems often disappear after a few hours or days. Avoid cold air if possible. Protect yourself from the cold, which can cause or worsen these symptoms. Wear gloves, socks, and something that covers your mouth and nose when outside in cold weather. Do not drink cold beverages or eat cold food for a few days after treatment. If symptoms continue for more than a week, or interfere with how your hands work, talk to your doctor. Try the ideas in Coping With/Preventing Oxaliplatin Cold Dysesthesias*. Diarrhea may occur during your treatment. This is very c ommon. To help diarrhea: Drink plenty of fluids Eat and drink often in small amounts Eat low fibre foods & avoid high fibre foods as outlined in Food Ideas to Help Manage Diarrhea* If you have an increase of less than 4 stools per day more than normal, or a mild increase in ostomy output, start the following: Loperamide (IMODIUM\u00ae) 2 mg, take 2 tablets (4 mg) to start, followed by 1 tablet (2 mg) every 4 hours, or after each unformed stool to a maximum of 8 tablets (16 mg) daily, unless otherwise directed by a physician BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFOXT 4/9 Developed: 1 Feb 2019 Revised: 1 Feb 2020 SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS DURING TREATMENT MANAGEMENT Sore mouth may occur during treatment. This is common. Mouth sores can occur on the tongue, the sides of the mouth or in the throat. Mouth sores or bleeding gums can lead to an infection. Brush your teeth gently after eating and at bedtime with a very soft toothbrush. If your gums bleed, use gauze instead of a brush. Use baking soda instead of toothpaste. Make a mouthwash with \u00bd teaspoon baking soda or salt in 1 cup warm water and rinse several times a day. Try soft, bland foods like puddings, milkshakes and cream soups. Avoid spicy, crunchy or acidic food, and very hot or cold foods. Try ideas in Food Ideas to Try with a Sore Mouth* Your white blood cells will decrease 7 - 10 days after your treatment. They usually return to normal 2 weeks after your last treatment. White blood cells protect your body by fighting bacteria (germs) that cause infection. When they are low, you are at greater risk of having an infection. To help prevent infection: Wash your hands often and always after using the bathroom. Take care of your skin and mouth. Call your doctor immediately at the first sign of an infection such as fever (over 100\u00baF or 38\u00baC by an oral thermometer), chills, cough, or burning when you pass urine. BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFOXT 5/9 Developed: 1 Feb 2019 Revised: 1 Feb 2020 OTHER SIDE EFFECTS DURING TREATMENT MANAGEMENT Pain or tenderness may occur where the needle was placed. Apply warm compresses or soak in warm water for 15 -20 min s. several times a day. Fever may occur shortly after treatment with oxaliplatin. Fever should last no more than 24 hours. Fever , chills, and flu -like illness may rarely occur shortly after treatment with trastuzumab. Fever should last no longer than 24 hours. Take acetaminophen (e.g. TYLENOL\u00ae) every 3 - 4 hours. Fever (over 100\u00b0F or 38\u00b0C by an oral thermometer) which occurs more than 48 hours after treatment may be the sign of an infection. See \"white blood cells\" above. Your platelets may decrease during or after your treatment. They will return to normal after your last treatment. This is common. Platelets help to make your blood clot when you hurt yourself. You may bruise or bleed more easily than usual. To help prevent bleeding p roblems: Try not to bruise, cut, or burn yourself. Clean your nose by blowing gently. Do not pick your nose. Avoid constipation. Brush your teeth gently with a soft toothbrush as your gums may bleed more easily. Maintain good oral hygiene. Some medications such as ASA (e.g. ASPIRIN\u00ae) or ibuprofen (e.g. ADVIL\u00ae) may increase your risk of bleeding. Do not stop taking any medication that has been prescribed by your doctor (e.g. ASA for your heart ). For minor pain, try acetaminophen (e.g. TYLENOL\u00ae) fi rst, but occasional use of ibuprofen may be acceptable. Skin rashes are uncommon but may occur. To help itching: You can use calamine lotion. If very irritating, call your doctor during office hours. Otherwise mention it at your next visit. Your skin may sunburn easily. To help prevent sunburn: Avoid direct sunlight. Wear a hat, long sleeves and long pants or skirt outside on sunny days. Apply a sun block lotion with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Refer to Your Medication Sun Sensitivity and Sunscreens* or the BC Health Guide for more information. After sun exposure, if you have a severe sunburn or skin reaction such as itching, rash, or swelling, contact your doctor. Loss of appetite is uncommon but may occur and may persist long after discontinuation of fluorouracil. Try the ideas in Food Ideas to Help with Decreased Appetite.* BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFOXT 6/9 Developed: 1 Feb 2019 Revised: 1 Feb 2020 OTHER SIDE EFFECTS DURING TREATMENT MANAGEMENT Tiredness and lack of energy may occur. Do not drive a car or operate machinery if you are feeling tired. Try the ideas in the handout titled Fatigue/Tiredness* Hair loss is uncommon with fluorouracil , rare with oxaliplatin and does not occur with trastuzumab. If you experience hair loss, your hair will grow back once you stop treatment. Colour and texture may change. Use a gentle shampoo and soft brush. Care should be taken with use of hair spray, bleaches, dyes and perms. Abnormal heart rhythm (QT prolongation) rarely occurs. Minimize your risk of abnormal heart rhythm by: Always checking with your pharmacist and doctor about drug interactions when starting a new medication, herbal product, or supplement. Tell your doctor immediately or get emergency help if your heart is beating irregularly or fast, or if you feel faint, lightheaded, or dizzy. *Please ask your chemotherapy nurse, pharmacist, or dietitian for a copy. Special note: Heart Problems: Serious heart problems can occur when starting fluorouracil. These can rarely be fatal. Problems such as chest pain, heart attack, abnormal heart rhythm, or heart failure can occur. Having a history of heart problems with capecitabine, a related chemotherapy drug, is a risk factor, as is having a history of prior angina (heart pain) or heart attack. Seek medical attention promptly if you experienc e feelings of heavy pressure or pain in the chest, trouble breathing, significant worsening leg swelling, or marked lightheadedness. These symptoms can occur within days after starting fluorouracil. If your symptoms are severe, you may need to call for eme rgency help.
