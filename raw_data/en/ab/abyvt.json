However, a real breakthrough is hampered by immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Myeloid- derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are one of the most important players in immune suppression in the TME. In the study presented here we found that c-di-GMP (ligand for STING), an ubiquitous bacterial signaling molecule and promising vaccine adjuvant, improved the therapeutic efficacy of an attenuated L. monocytogenes-based vaccine expressing tumor-associated antigen (TAA) Mage-b, in a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer (4T1), by targeting MDSC. An extreme low dose of c-di-GMP (0.01 nmol) combined with a low dose of Listeria-Mage-b (104 CFU), dramatically reduced the number of metastases, in correlation with a significant reduction of MDSC and a significant increase in CD8 T cell responses to Mage-b. Moreover, low dose of c-di-GMP increased the production of IL-12, while high dose killed tumor cells directly. Administration of one high dose c-di-GMP to kill the tumor cells, followed by repeated administrations of low dose c-di-GMP to improve CD8 T cell responses, provided similar efficacy against the metastatic breast cancer as Listeria-Mage-b and c-di- GMP in the 4T1 model. These results demonstrate that c-di-GMP is an attractive adjuvant for cancer therapy. "}
