Childhood trauma can cause overcompensation tendencies that eventually lead to burnout. Inflammation in your body is another root cause of burnout. Mothers can pass down stress and anxiety in the womb. When a pregnant woman is experiencing a traumatic or stressful event, the genes of the baby in the womb become more accustomed to the stress hormone cortisol. The baby is then born with a more hypersensitive nervous system. If you want to prevent or treat burnout you must: heal emotions from childhood, release generational trauma, reduce inflammation toxicity by healing your gut and liver, and rebuild your adrenal glands to sustain everyday stress.

A damaged gut is often a trigger for autoimmune conditions. Noticing that it's using energy means I'm actually, it's an active process. Meaning I'm making a lot of effort into pleasing people and making a lot of effort into smiling. It's not that I'm stuck in a smile because out of fear, it's I'm using my fear to smile more. And when you get that paradigm shift, suddenly you let go. More toxins then leak into your bloodstream. Cause more inflammation throughout your body triggering an immune response. And it aggravates all the immune cells, lining your gut, the gut associated lymphatic tissue.

So using the psychotherapy and trauma release, as well as homeopathy, which will cover specific remedies to heal trauma today, healing the energetic imprint, that's vibrating and causing disease in a person, causing anxiety in a person, throwing the person off balance. These narratives then reinforce our unhappiness, our self-esteem, the way we talk to ourselves, the way we think who we are, because we've learned this language and we're using it upon our experiences. So it gets embedded deeper and deeper into our reality. So with soft love, compassion, embodiments, somatic therapies, we can slowly discharge some of these nervous system imprints and come back to an authentic energetic feeling in our body. So you've got the trauma and the inflammation throwing of cortisol, which leads to brain chemical imbalances. So you're going to anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts and OCD. Your liver becomes toxic from chronic inflammation, and then you get less bile flow. So you get more gas, bloating, constipation, you get a hormonal imbalance leading to certain types of cancer. Now you can more toxicity in the body. So more free radical damage, and also trauma shuts down your mitochondria and your ATP production, they've shown that.

Gestalt uses various techniques like two chair work, where you switch chairs and you speak to the adult part of you or the mother, the father, et cetera. Then you come the mother and you speak back to the child and then you get an awareness, like a paradigm shift. Therapy effect: you're trying to manage your way out of this anxiety and information with the same mind that got traumatized, you're doing it on your own and with a good therapist who can hold the space long enough for you to actually take a peek and make contact outside. Suddenly your heart opens up and you feel, hey, I can rest with wrestling in my own mind. And I create a trust with the outside world. Then your guard drops, the armor drops, your breathing changes, your physiology changes.
