There are several ways to stimulate and heal your chakras & regain focus and overall balance in your life. You can use your breath, deep meditation, yoga, mantras, special movements, or aromatherapy. In the world of [aromatherapy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/784348650/chakra-healing-oils-chakra-roller-bottle?ref=shop_home_feat_1&pro=1&frs=1) certain essential oils are associated with certain [chakras.](https://www.etsy.com/listing/784348650/chakra-healing-oils-chakra-roller-bottle?ref=shop_home_feat_1&pro=1&frs=1) In this article, I will guide you through each individual chakra and introduce you to its corresponding essential oils. Aromatherapy is a wonderful way to connect your inner self with your physical body. All the sensations you tend to feel when you are using a specific oil have a corresponding chakra that is being balanced as you treat yourself with a deliciously scented and natural essential oil. The history of using essential oils for spiritual purposes has a long history and with good reason, certain oils were found to stimulate certain energy centers in your body. I have carefully created these blends, hoping my clients could use them to balance their chakras and nurture their inner world. I have found that the best way to do this is to combine aromatherapy and a form of chakra meditation. If you ever feel like a certain aspect of your inner self is a bit off and unbalanced, you can simply take the corresponding oil blend and do a simple massage. Close your eyes, apply your oil on the spot that needs balancing (for example your belly for the solar plexus chakra), and massage in your oil as you breathe and focus on this spot. Your fingers will work in the oil and massage in all the beneficial properties they hold. The Root Chakra We will begin with the first chakra - the Root Chakra.
