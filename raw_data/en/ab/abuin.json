Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) Delighted with this product! Perfect for our brand new trauma informed daycare. I will be giving this balance beam as a gift, so it has not been used yet, but it appears to be very high quality, sturdy, and the wood is beautiful. It matched the description and product photos perfectly and arrived within the same week I ordered it. I had been considering several balance beam options, and am so glad I chose this one. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. My kiddos love this, it's so fun to watch them move and play on it! Great quality product. Paid more than some alternatives, but this is Canadian made and shipping is not only fast but reasonably priced. Great quality product.
