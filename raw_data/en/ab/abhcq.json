Essential oils are complex mixtures of aromatic substances that give the unique characteristic of each herb and are found in special cells in the plant called trichomes. Almost all herbs can be grown for the production of essential oils but the yield of oil from each species dictates whether this is commercially viable.

Lavender it is now thriving there once again on the warm south facing limestone slopes in Kent, and it is also grown commercially in Jersey, Norfolk and on the Cotswold Hills.
