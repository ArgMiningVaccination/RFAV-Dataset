Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on April 08, 2018 Many healing practices and spiritual ceremonies that are being practiced today by healing practitioners and metaphysical groups have been adopted from traditions that originated from various Native American tribes. History indicates that each tribe would have one or more elders who were groomed in the healing arts. These individuals would serve as herbalists, healers, and spirit communicators. The duties and types of healing arts and spiritual ceremonies performed would naturally vary from tribe to tribe. Native American healing arts and practices are earth-based, honoring and respectful of the Father Sky, Mother Earth, Grandfather Sun, and Grandmother Moon. Tribal Leaders Disapprove of Shamanism Workshops Today's tribal leaders often frown on terms such as Shamanism, Shaman, and even Medicine Man being used so freely as a means to lure students to learn Native American practices. Disapproval is warranted when seminars and workshops commercially touted as \"Native Shamanism\" are not purely traditional teachings, but are a packaged blend of studies which include bits of Native American ceremonies along with Wiccan spells, New Age spirituality, and Eastern medicine.
