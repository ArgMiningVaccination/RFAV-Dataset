Now a days more number of people are having nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) associated with Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, Dyslipidaemia,PCOS and the Metabolic Syndrome. Lets understand the Organ Liver The liver is the body's largest gland and heaviest organ. It is a highly vascular organ that receives approximately 30% of resting cardiac output. The liver is the organ in which virtually all nutritional substances are metabolised. Because the liver is so important in fat metabolism, it is the most common site for fat accumulation. Depending on the cause and extent of the accumulation, fatty change can be mild and reversible or severe, resulting in irreversible cell injury and cell death. Fatty liver is caused by disruptions in lipid metabolism in the liver caused by a variety of etiological factors. What is Fatty Liver? Fatty liver is an abnormal accumulation of certain fats (triglycerides) inside liver cells. Fatty liver is a reversible condition in which large amounts of fat accumulate in liver cells due to the steatosis process.

Fatty Liver Causes The most common causes of fatty liver are: - excessive alcohol consumption - obesity - metabolic abnormalities such as excess body weight, insulin resistance, and high levels of fats (triglycerides and cholesterol) in the blood - Certain medications, such as corticosteroids, tamoxifen, and chemotherapy drugs; - Hereditary metabolic disorders The combination of excess body weight, insulin resistance, and high triglyceride levels is called Metabolic Syndrome. All of these conditions cause fat to accumulate in liver cells by increasing fat synthesis or slowing fat processing and excretion. As a result, fat builds up and is stored within liver cells. A high-fat diet alone will not result in fatty liver. What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease?
