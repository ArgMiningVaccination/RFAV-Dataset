Given the need to swiftly and efficiently vaccinate our state's population, the Washington State Secretar y of Health and the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have issued authorizations under the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) for certain other types of providers, students, out- of-state license holders, and inactive or expired license holders to administer COVID -19 vaccines in Washington who otherwise would not be permitted to do so under state law.1 To determine whether and how you are authorized to administer COVID -19 vaccines i n Washington, consult the information for your profession in the list below . For many professions, holding an active Washington license provides sufficient authority to administer vaccines. For others , additional requirements may need to be met before you may begin administering vaccines. You need to be authorized under only one category , but you may be authorized under multiple . If you are authorized under multiple categories , all are legally valid alternative pathways to administering vaccines, but one of the categories may have less burdensome requirements for you to meet. If you meet the requirements of one category , you do not need to meet the requirements of another category . For instance, if you meet the requirements of the HHS PREP Act authorization, then you do not need to meet state law requirements, such as those f or su pervision or training. 1 The PREP Act generally provides immunity from suit and liability with respect to all claims for loss caused by, arising out o f, relating to, or resulting from the administration of COVID -19 vaccines. This immunity applies equally to people who are eligibl e to administer COVID -19 vaccines under an active Washington license and those who are eligible pursuant to an authorization issued under the PREP Act.
