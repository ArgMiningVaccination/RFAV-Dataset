Allergies are an overreaction of the immune system to normally harmless substances or foods. This is a result of a confusion in the immune system that produces antibodies against substances that it is not supposed to. A person can become allergic to a substance at any time in life, though some allergies are hereditary. There are numerous factors that trigger the immune system into becoming hyperreactive. (discussed in the blog [Immune System Disorders](/disease_category/immune-system-disorders/)) Conventional treatment of allergies involves either managing the allergy symptoms using antihistamines, steroidal medications or by immunotherapy (a process of injecting purified allergens into the body in order to reduce the intensity of allergies over a period of several years) Each individual is unique with their expression of health imbalance and are treated as such.
