INGREDIENTS 80mg English Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) Flower Oil (Silexan brand) ** Daily Value (DV) not established Percent daily value is based on a 2000 calorie diet Other Ingredients Lavela WS 1265 Does Not Contain Salt Gluten swallow 1 softgel once or twice daily with a full glass of water, or as recommended by a healthcare professional. Do not chew. A small number of individuals may experience mild aromatic burps, in this case, swallow softgel with a full glass of water and food. WarningDo not use if you are pregnant, nursing, or under 12 years of age. If you are taking any medications, consult a healthcare professional before use. Keep out of reach of children. This product has a tamper-evident foil pouch. Do not use if foil or plastic is punctured. Store at room temperature. Avoid excessive heat and direct sunlight. INTERACTIONS FAQS A: Eructation (burping up) is a common experience with Lavela WS 1265. This experience does not lower the efficacy of the product nor does it cause additional problems. Taking Lavela WS 1265 with food may help to reduce the eructation. A: Lavela can be taken with or without food. We recommend drinking a full glass of water with your dose. A: Every person is different, but in the clinical trials, participants experienced changes within the first several weeks. A: Lavender essential oil is obtained from the steam distillation processing of the flowering tops of L.angustifolia. The main active constituents of lavender oil are linalool, linalyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol, and camphor. The quantity of these constituents can vary in different oils. If inferior harvesting techniques or sub-par plant material is used, one can still make an essential oil and it will still smell like lavender, but the balance of constituents will be different. Lavela WS 1265 is very well characterized in terms of the content of its various constituents, unique in composition, and the only lavender essential oil with demonstrated efficacy and safety in published, controlled clinical trials.
