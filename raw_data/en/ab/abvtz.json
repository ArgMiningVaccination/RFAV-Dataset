Event Geoscope and Risk Assessment Levels No updates have been made to the existing geographic scope2 (geoscope) and risk level for the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) event reported in Uganda. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) will continue to monitor the situation and update this assessment as needed. 1 Due to a previous reporting error, the number of deaths were reduced from 56 to 55 and the recoveries increased to 87 2 The GeoScope level is determined by where the event is currently occurring on the continent. Low: event is limited to sub -national area s within one MS; Moderate: Event is affecting multiple countries within an AU region, or have been imported from/exported to 1 -2 countries from another global region; High: Event is affecting several multinational AU regions, or have been imported from/exported to >2 countries from another global region; Very high: Event is considered a pandemic, affecting multiple continents or worldwide Figure 1: SVD cases an d deaths by epidemiological week reported for weeks 38 - 50 (19 September - 13 December 20221) Table 1.

The SUDV trial vaccines will be used for ring vaccination of high -risk contacts. This is the first batch of three candidate va ccines against SVD that will be provided by WHO. 4,384 (91%) of 4,802 contacts identified from 15 districts completed 21 days of monitoring 142 (3%) of 4,687 samples tested to date are positive for SVD 640 safe and dignified burial (SDBs) conducted to date 19,741 teachers, students and pupils oriented on water, sanitation and hygiene and infection prevention and control for SVD 338 community health workers oriented on SVD 162,265 people in 33,052 households oriented on SVD prevention and control MoH commiss ioned a new Ebola treatment unit at Mulago national referral hospital MoH continues to provide psychosocial support to contacts, survivors and families of cases MoH continues to support safe and dignified burials in all high -risk districts, including manda tory testing on all dead bodies regardless of cause of death MoH continues to conduct Infection prevention and control mentorships at health facilities in the high -risk districts New Africa CDC Response Activities Africa CDC activated its Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) on 26 September 2022 to support preparedness a nd response efforts of African Union Mem ber States in close collaboration with relevant partners The Africa CDC rapid response team continues to support risk communication and community engagement, contact tracing and surveillance activities in the affecte d districts Africa CDC activated 45 village health task forces in Busede sub -county Africa CDC conducts a weekly IPC webinar series to train healthcare workers (HCWs) across Africa on EVD outbreak interventions such as IPC considerations on the handling of EVD cases in the community, at healthcare facilities and on how to conduct a risk assessment. To date, 35,300 HCWs have been reached Africa CDC field team in Mubende district demonstrated the assembling of a mobile field sequencing lab to ensure real time sequencing of pathogens like Ebola Recommendations for the Member States Africa CDC recommends that African Union (AU) Member States (MS) should remain vigilant. In doing this, AU MS are advised to: Enhance cross -border surveillance efforts by: o Mapping population movements to identify all potential crossing points where there is risk of disease spread. o Setting up screening posts and conducting health screenings for all travellers to detect signs and symptoms of SVD (e.g., fever, rash, vomiting, d iarrhoea, and haemorrhage). o Sharing health information for SVD at borders. Integrate SVD surveillance into the existing surveillance strategies at community and health facility levels. Perform contact tracing and follow up of all probable and confirmed SVD cases. Enhance IPC measures in health care settings and affected communities. Notify and routinely share data regarding confirmed SVD cases, deaths, recoveries, tests conducted, and healthcare workers infected with Africa CDC to inform these and other updates. Notify Africa CDC by emailing: AfricaCDCEBS@africa -union.org . Provide information to the general public about seeking immediate medical care for those who develop symptoms similar to SVD.
