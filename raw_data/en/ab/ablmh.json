One approach people are beginning to take notice of is the use of crystals for addiction. While we offer evidence-based addiction rehab approaches and do not necessarily provide this treatment method, we believe it is important to be informed. Today, people search for ways to feel grounded, calm anxiety, and relieve stress. [Alternative therapies](https://www.newdirectionsforwomen.org/therapy/holistic/) such as yoga and mindfulness are becoming common daily practices to achieve this mental peace. The healing powers of crystals are also becoming mainstream. But are there crystals for sobriety? While many addiction treatment centers offer holistic therapies, these approaches should not replace evidence-based treatment programs. Alternative therapies, including crystals, help people become spiritually connected with themselves. Crystals for addiction can have positive effects and encourage lasting recovery. What Are Crystals? Crystals are formed from natural minerals. They have repeated lattice structures that are perfectly consistent throughout the shape. Although crystals can be made of one mineral, many of them are made of combinations of minerals. For example, a diamond is made purely of carbon. Quartz, however, is a foundation mineral in many healing stones and crystals for sobriety. Quartz is composed of silica and oxygen and is found in Tiger's Eye, Jasper, and other crystals. How Do Crystals Work? The methodologies of crystal healing rely on the \"vibrations\" of the stones. For example, quartz, the cornerstone of crystal healing, generates electricity. In fact, if you strike two pieces together in a dark room, you will see sparks of light. It's obvious that crystals have uses that involve conducting energy. Crystal healing suggests they can conduct energy within the body to restore balance and awaken the spirit. Addiction [negatively affects the mind](https://www.newdirectionsforwomen.org/how-does-alcohol-affect-you-emotionally-the-emotional-effects-of-alcohol-abuse/), body, and spirit, and using crystals for addiction recovery offers many benefits. Examples of Healing Crystals The benefits of using crystals for improving your physical and mental health are becoming increasingly popular. Walking into a crystal shop can be overwhelming because there is a wide variety of crystals, and each has its own healing powers. Some common crystals include: - Clear Quartz - Black Tourmaline - Amethyst - Citrine - Aquamarine - Rose Quartz - Tiger's Eye - Moonstone - Obsidian Since there are so many crystals with different benefits, it is good to know what you need help working on and which crystals can help. Although there are crystals for addiction and crystals for sobriety, there are specific crystals for alcohol addiction and drug addiction. The Healing Effects of Crystals for Addiction According to science, crystals have no proven healing powers. But, the alternative medicine community believes otherwise. According to cosmic energy healer Eva Antoniadou, \" Crystals have potent healing powers, and when you touch them, healing is immediately activated.\" Holding crystals or placing them in specific spots on the body can promote physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Crystals work by activating the body's chakras or energy field, which helps alleviate stress, improve concentration, and encourage new perspectives. Crystals can provide a multitude of benefits to everyone in addiction recovery.

It is important to remember that using crystals for addiction treatment is NOT a standard practice inside addiction treatment centers and DOES NOT replace evidence-based treatment programs. Using crystals for addiction treatment is a holistic form of treatment to boost mental well-being. However, many people believe in the power of crystals for alcohol addiction and other addictions and encourage you to also benefit from their use. Using a Crystal for Addiction Recovery While this approach to treatment and recovery is becoming more widespread, it is necessary to know that it is not a practice many rehab facilities use. Since this is the case, individuals who wish to use this approach may find that they must choose which crystals to use on their own. The following tips may help individuals who choose this method: - Choose the crystal you are drawn to. This is often the most recommended way because it uses your own intuition. If a crystal catches your eye or calls to you, pick it up because it has a message or purpose for you. - Select your crystal based on your struggles. Whether you're struggling with the [cravings](https://www.newdirectionsforwomen.org/how-to-control-drug-cravings/)of early recovery or anxiety after years in recovery, there is a crystal to help you cope. - Choose a crystal according to what you want. For example, if you want to live life to its fullest, you might choose carnelian. Or maybe you will pick azurite to stimulate your mind. How are Crystals for Sobriety Used? There are many ways to use crystals in your recovery journey. While there are some complicated ways to incorporate crystals into your life, let's talk about the most common ways. Wearing Crystals Wearing your crystal or crystals is the easiest way to use them. Whether you wear them as jewelry or keep them in your pocket, it allows you to have their healing benefits everywhere you go. In times of stress, you can just hold the crystals in your hand to block negative emotions. Meditating With Crystals Crystals may promote calm and focus, which can help with meditation. Meditation has many benefits, especially in recovery. After cleansing the negative energy from your crystal (holding under warm running water), imagine your crystal is a vessel for excess energy. Imagine your energy flowing into the crystal when you seek peace and calm. And when you need clarity, imagine the energy traveling deep into your mind. Crystal Infused Water Water is a crucial component of recovery. Incorporating the benefits of crystals into your water spreads the energy throughout your body from the inside. There are specialty water bottles typically with rose quartz, but they can be expensive. Many crystals are toxic when consumed, so it is recommended to use them in bath water instead. Decorate Your Space You do not have to wear crystals to benefit from them. Decorating your space, whether at home or work, can influence the energy in that room. Some people use feng shui principles when placing their crystals and others experiment to find what feels best. Crystals for Sobriety is Only One Part of Treatment Like the struggles of addiction, crystals come in a variety of types.
