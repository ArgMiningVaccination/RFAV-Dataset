Better Sleep Reduced or Complete Freedom From Pain More Energy Meet the Team - Dr. Steve Feinzig - Katie Gilliam What People Are Saying \"Dr. Steve is the most intuitive chiropractor I have ever been to, somehow he always knows just how to adjust me no matter what is bothering me. My family has been going to see him for years and it's always a pleasure to see him and the ever smiling Melissa behind the front desk. She knows everyone who comes into the office and is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet. Lots of good humor and good advice in this office! I highly recommend Natural Life Chiropractic.\" \u2014 Shari D. \"Not only is my injured knee healing quickly and without medication, I am also feeling much better overall. I have long looked to yoga and exercise as a natural treatment for insomnia, anxiety, and depression, and I have worked very hard to learn to live with these conditions. After only a few sessions with Dr. Steve, I think for the first time it might be possible to learn to live without them\" \u2014 Griffin A. \"Thank you Dr. Steve for everything you have done for me for all these years. You have helped me tremendously with my horrible Back pain, neck pain and I really appreciate it. It has kept me away from other doctors and medications. YOU are all I need besides a real vacation. You have also helped my children out with adjustments whenever they needed and that means alot to me that my kids are healthier because of you. We Love "}
