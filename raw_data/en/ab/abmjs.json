Flores, President UHD 1 University of Houston-Downtown: Houston's Downtown University Mission Statement The University of Houston-Downtown is a comprehensive four-year university offering bachelor's and selected master's degree programs and providing strong academic and career preparation as well as life-long learning opportunities. Locat ed in the heart of the city, the University reflects the diversity of the Greater Houston Metropolitan Area and, through its academic programs, engages with the community to address the needs and advance the development of the region. UHD is an inclusive co mmunity dedicated to integrating teaching, service, and scholarly re search to develop students' talents and prepare them for success in a dynamic global society. University of Houston-Downtown: Houston's Downtown University Located in the heart of Houston, UHD is a public, four-year university that offers excellent educational o pportunities through its colleges of Business, Humanities and Social Sci ences, Public Serv ice, Sciences and Technology, and University College. UHD offers five bachelor's degrees (Bac helor of Arts, Bachelor of Sci- ence, Bachelor of Business Administ ration, Bachelor of Engineering Technology, and Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences) with majors in 39 areas, and three master's degrees (Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Science, and Master of Security Management), with programs in seven areas. UHD is nationally recognized for its outstanding academic opportuni- ties and for its connectivity to the communities, agencies and people in the greater Houston metropolitan area. In 2009 it ranked 33 rd nationally for graduating Hispanic students with bachelor's degrees as reported in Hispanic Outlook Magaz ine. UHD is the second largest public university in Houston and it has been recognized as a leader in community service by being named to the 2009 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll by the Corporation for National Community Service. In June 2010, UHD opened the doors to UHD Northwest, a new campus at Lone Star College - University Park that lets students move from an associate degree to a bachelor's degree at the same location. Students choose UHD because they enjoy the flexible degree options UHD provides. Students take classes online, through live interactive television classes, in traditional classrooms at satellite locations, and through hybrid arrangements that blend online and traditional classroom instruction. UHD also offers classes at Lone Star College-CyFair and Lone Star College-Kingwood. UHD's weekend and evening classes also help put a degree within reach for students who work full time. The nature of the UHD student population prepares individuals to thrive in the multicultural workpl ace of the 21st century. UHD students are diverse in every sense of t he word: in ethnicity, age, financial background and life situation. U.S. News & World Report has often named UHD one of the nation's most ethnically diverse institutions of higher learning. UHD's campus has grown considerably since the institution was founded in 1974. The campus includes the historic One Main Building, the Academic Building, the Commerce Street Building, the Shea Street Building, the Jesse H. Jones Student Life Building, and the restored Willow Street Pump Station. UHD's History and Future on the Bayou UHD is creating an exciting future based on a fascinating past. The university's history began in 1974, when the assets of the private South Texas Junior College were transferred to the University of Houston. By 1979, the Texas Legislature approved the new institution as a separate entity within the University of Houston System. In 1983, the name was changed to the University of Houston-Downtown. Today UHD is the second largest institution in the University of Houston System, which includes four distinct universities: the University of Houston, UH-Clear Lake, University of Houston-Downtown, and UH-Victoria. All four institutions are governed by the UH System Board of Regents. The chief administrative officer at each university is its president. The history of the university's campus goes back even farther. The campus's One Main Building was constructed in 1929 on the banks of White Oak Bayou and Buffalo Bayou. Then known as the Merchants and Manufacturers Building, the buildi ng served the city for decades as a center for commerce and manufacturing. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. UHD's facilities have continued to c hange since the university's incep- tion. In the late 1990s, UHD added the Academic Building, with more than 40 classrooms and lecture halls; the Technology Teaching and Learning Center; the Wilhelmina Cull en Robertson Auditorium; and a food court. While the Academic Building was taking shape, so was the Jesse H. Jones Student Life Center, a state-of-the-art facility devoted to student health, recreation, and fitness. In 2004, the university opened the Commerce Street Building, which houses the College of Public Serv ice, classrooms, academic labs, computer labs, meeting spaces and faculty offices. In fall 2007, the university opened yet another showcase facility, the Shea Street Building at the corner of Main and Shea Streets. The new home for UHD's College of Busine ss features a glass-enclosed entrance that provides stunning views of Houston's downtown skyline. Adjoining this award-winning new building is a multi-story parking facility. UHD students enjoy the excitement of the nation's fourth largest city and enjoy being just minutes away from Minute Maid Park, the Toyota Center, world-class museums and art galleries, and a wide assortment of restaurants and sidewalk cafes. Getting to and around campus is easy for students with UHD's free shuttle bus, the city's light rail line that stops at the University's front door, and easy access from two interstate highways. UHD's innovative wireless campus prov ides faculty, staff, and students with optimum service and flexibility. In addition to applying for 2 admission and registering for classes online, students can handle much of the \"business\" of going to college from laptops or desktops while at home or at school. And connectivity makes it easy to meet online with other students for group projects and classes. Since its founding, the University of Houston-Downtown has continued to grow and provide degrees, programs, and facilities to meet the needs of students, faculty, and staff. It is all part of UHD's commitment to providing access and opportunity to higher education.

Method of Payment Students shall be provided with two alternative methods of payment of tuition and mandatory fees for each semester for which they are enrolled. Full payment of all tuition and mandatory fees prior to the beginning of the semester, or Installment Plan Fall and Spring semesters - Four equal payments with the first payment plus a $24 installment fee to be made in advance of the beginning of the semester and the remaining payments to be made monthly beginning approximately 30 days after the start of the semester and the final payment to be made before the last day of the semester. There will be a $10 late fee added for each install-ment payment not received by the due date. Installment payments are also available online thr ough Student e-Services under the My Payment option. Summer semesters - Two equal payments with the first payment plus a $16 installment fee to be made in advance of the beginning of the summer term and the final payment to be made before the last day of the term. There will be a $10 late fee added for each installment payment not received by the due date. Installment payments are also available online through Student e-Services under the My Payment option. 16Payment may be made by cash, check or credit card. Payment may be made in person, by mail, online (credit/debit card or echeck) or thru the payment drop box located in the hall next to the cashier's office on the third floor. Credit card payment (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover) may be made over the web via UHD's Student e-services (www.uhd.edu) or by fax to 713-226-5267 (authorization form available at http://www.uhd.edu/cashiers/documents/CREDITCARDAUTHORIZATI ONFORM.pdf ). Please remember that mailed payments must be received by the posted payment deadlines to avoid having classes dropped or late fees assessed. UHD does not receive mail on Saturday, so payments must be received by Friday for Saturday deadlines. Health Insurance fees shall be pai d prior to the beginning of the semester. Most financial aid awards will be credited to your account automatically once processing is completed and you are registered for the same number of hours for which you are awarded. It is the student's responsibility to check their fee statement to assure that their funds have been posted to their account before the payment deadline. If the funds have not been posted, the student must make the payment or other arrangements with the cashier office by the deadline to avoid losing their classes. Student fee statements can be viewed through UHD's Student e-services (www.uhd.edu), the My Payment option. Students receiving financial aid equal to, or in excess of, the total amount of tuition and fees prior to the beginning of the semester may not participate in the installment plan. The full payment of tuition and fees for the semester in which they are enrolled must be made upon issuance of that semester's fi nancial aid funds before any excess amounts will be refunded. Withdrawal from the university, for whatever reason, w ill not cancel the obligation to pay the full amount of the installment plan. If the amount of tuition and fees credited as a result of withdrawal is less than the remaining balance of an installment pl an, the balance remaining is still the obligation of the student. If the credited amount is more than the balance of an installment plan, the remaining credit will be refunded to the student. Any student who has elected to pay tuition and fees by installment, and who is delinquent in making payment by the final installment due date, is barred from registering at any institution in the University of Houston System until full payment, including delinquent charges, has been made. Each university maintains reco rds and informs other institutions about the status of payments should the student attempt to register for courses or pursue a degree at any other component of the University of Houston System. An additional default fee of $50 is collected from any student who fails to make all installment payments by the end of the semester. This fee, in addition to all other amounts due, must be paid prior to the student's registering for courses during a subsequent semester. Financial Responsibility Students are required to meet financial responsibilities to the university. Students who write checks to the university on accounts with insufficient funds are assessed a $20 service charge for each such check, regardless of the amount. If a check is returned as a result of bank error, the student must deal with the bank for reimbursement of the $20 returned check charge paid to the university. If such a check is presented in payment of tuition an d fees, the payment will be reversed from the student account and student will be subject to all applicable late fee and drop dates. Failure to make a valid payment by the drop date WILL result in loss of registration and a reinstatement charge may be required before reenrollment is approved. A student who does not meet financial responsibilities to the university may be subject to withdrawal from classes and may be referred to law enforcement authorities and/or the local credit bureau. Once an account is referred to our collection agency, the student is responsible for payment of additional collection fees. An official transcript shall not be given to or on behalf of a student who is in default on any payment due the university. The student will not be allowed to re-enroll at UHD or any UH system university until all past due payments have been made. Additionally, students in default are reported to the State Comptroller and will not be able to receive a payment from any state agency until the debt is cleared.

The application is available online at http://www.uhd.edu/financial/index.html Direct Lending Procedures for All Borrowers Effective Fall 2010 Getting Started: 1. Important: You will need your Department of Education issued PIN (the same PIN used for the FAFSA) in order to complete and electronically sign your new electronic Master Promissory Note (eMPN) under the Direct Loan Program. If you have forgotten your PIN or do not yet have one, please go to www.pin.ed.gov to have your PIN sent to you. 2. Have your social security number, date of birth, and driver's license number accessible. 3. You will also be required to provide two personal references (full name, address, and telephone number) whom you have known for at least three years.

Now Print Your MPN Once you complete the eMPN process correctly, UHD will receive notification electronically that you have completed your MPN. This will allow the UHD Financial Aid Office to continue working on your loan disbursement process. Other Eligibility Requirements UHD Degree-Seeking Student Requirement To be eligible for financial aid, students must be admitted as a degree-seeking student at UHD. Transient st udents (students taking classes to transfer toward a degree pursued at another institution) are not eligible for financial aid at UHD. Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements In order to receive financial aid, students must make progress toward their degree as defined by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. There are three components to academic progress: Grade Point Requirement Undergraduate students must achieve and maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative grade point average on all course work attempted. Graduate students must achieve and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0. Completion Requirement Students must complete at least 73% of all course work attempted. Time Frame Requirement Students may attempt up to 170 hours without earning a degree. Students who have earned their first bachelor's degree are allowed 150% of the hours remaining to complete their program. A complete copy of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy is available upon request. Please read this policy to s ee how progress will be monitored. The Office of Scholarships and Financ ial Aid is required to review students' entire academic records (regardless of the age of the record or whether or not aid was received) to determine compliance. Students found not to be in compliance will be notified in writing of any denial/suspension and the appr opriate appeal procedure. Dropping Classes Students' final eligibility for aid will be based on the number of hours for which they are enrolled on the Official Day of Record listed in the Class Schedule . If they register and then drop classes prior to that date, their eligibility for aid will be RECALCULATED on the remaining hours as of the Official Day of Re cord. Since financial aid is released prior to the Official Day of Record, students who receive a financial aid payment based on more hours than t hose remaining as of the Official Day of Record may be responsible for repaying a portion of any financial aid received. Dropping classes may affect students' eligibility for future aid. Students should c onsult the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy to determine if dr opping classes will affect their eligibility for aid. Total Withdrawal from School For students who register and then tota lly withdraw from all classes, eligibility for aid will be RECALCUL ATED based on the number of days they attended class. If they totally withdraw from all classes prior to the first class day, they must repay any and all financial aid received. If they withdraw on or after the first class day, they may have to repay a portion of any cash financial aid received. Students who have failed to earn a passing grade in any of their classes are considered to have totally withdrawn from school and may have to repay a portion of any financial aid received. See Return of Title IV Funds below. Students who totally withdraw should consult the definition of Satisfactory Academic Progress to determine if their withdrawal will affect their eligibility for future aid. Return of Title IV Funds The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 changed the formula for calculating the amount of aid a student and school can retain when the student totally withdraws from all classes or fails to earn a passing grade in any of the current semester's classes. Students who withdraw from all classes prior to completing 60% of the semester will have their eligibility for aid recalculated based on the percent of the semester completed. For example, a student who withdraws completing only 30% of the term will have \"earned\" only 30% of any Title IV aid received. The remaining 70% must be returned by the school and/or the student. A student who fails to earn a passing grade in any of his/her courses will have their eligibility recalculated based on the midpoint of the semester or the last date of participation in an academically related activity. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid encourages you to obtain a complete copy of this policy from the office and read it carefully. If you are thinking about withdrawing from all classes PRIOR to completing 60% of the semester, you should contact the Office of Scholarship s and Financial Aid to see how your withdrawal will affect your financial aid. 20Academic Scholarships Academic scholarships at UHD are intended to recognize and reward outstanding achievement and community involvement. Applicants for most scholarships, therefore, do not need to show evidence of financial need to apply. The application deadline for most UHD scholarships is April 1 of each academic year. However, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid may accept applicat ions at other times during the year if scholarship funds are av ailable. Interested students should contact the Office of Scholarship s and Financial Aid as soon as they decide to apply for admission at UHD to find out what scholarships are available. Many academic departments at UHD also award scholarships. Students are encouraged to contact the department of their major to find out what departm ental scholarships are available. Tuition and Fee Exemptions Hazlewood Act for Veterans State law provides that a veteran who is a legal Texas resident is exempted from tuition and certain r equired fees, but not from deposits, if the following criteria are met.

To obtain this exemption, the vete ran must submit an application with attached evidence to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by the Official Day of Record of the term for which the veteran is applying for the Hazlewood benefits. Hazlewood applications must be renewed each year. Academic Policies-Undergraduate Courses and Course Credit Course Load Maximum course loads are established to encourage students to think carefully about the amount of time they will need to devote to each class. The following policies are in place so that students are better able to meet their course obligations successfully. A standard undergraduate course load during the fall and spring terms is 15 to 16 semester credit hours, or five courses. Twelve semester cr edit hours are considered the minimum full-time load. Students who are employed 40 hours per week should take no more than two courses, or six credit hours. Students who wish to enroll in 20 credit hours or more in a fall or spring term must receive approval from the assistant or associate dean of their college. The standard load for one summer session is six to eight credit hours. Students who wish to enroll in nine hours or more in a single summer session or in two overlapping summer sessions must receive approval from the assistant or associate dean of their college. For information on the graduate course load, consult specific master's degree coordinator. Schedule Changes Schedule changes may be made in person or online, and may require approval by an academic advisor. Instructions are found in each semester's Class Schedule . Discontinued Classes The university reserves the right to discontinue classes or otherwise alter the class schedule. Whenever possible, enrollment in an alternate course is completed through an administrative change form initiated by the department responsible for discontinuing the class. Classification Undergraduate classification is deter mined by the number of credit hours which have been hours and above: senior . Master's classification is determined by admission status. Class Attendance Students are expected to attend all class sessions. The responsibility for withdrawing from a course lies with the student. Departments and faculty members may have other attendance policies for their courses. Transfer Credit-Undergraduate Acceptance of Transfer Credit Transfer students must submit official transcripts from all colleges or universities attended as a part of the admission process (see New and Transfer Student Admission , pages 11-12). An evaluation will be performed during a student's first semester at the university. Course work transferred or accepted for credit toward an undergraduate degree must represent collegiate course work relevant to the degree, with course content and level of instruction resulting in student competencies at least equivalent to those of students enrolled in the institution's own undergraduate degree program. UHD may not accept transfer credit for courses in which grades of D have been earned except for courses which are part of the approved transferable core curriculum. Courses transfer on the same level and with the corresponding number of hours as earned at another institution. Courses taken at a junior or community college do not transfe r as upper-level credits. 21Courses taken at other colleges that do not correspond to courses offered by UHD may transfer as electi ve credit, with the approval of the appropriate academic dean. With the consent of the appropriate dean, the chair of the department in which a student is majoring will make the decision concerning application of transfer credit to the degree program. Therefore declared majors should obtain approval fr om their degree-granting college before taking courses from a community or junior college which they wish to transfer to UHD. In general, UHD does not award trans fer credit for vocational courses that are not considered part of a standard college curriculum. Students may petition the academic dean of the college in which they are seeking their degree, who may agree to award credit for such courses in exceptional circumstances. Students should direct questions conc erning transfer credit to their academic advisor or degree program coordinator. Evaluation of Transfer Credit Transcripts will be evaluated for institutional transfer credit upon completion of the admission application process. Students accepted later in the admission cycle may no t have their transcripts evaluated until after they have actually enro lled. Transfer work will be further evaluated for applicability to th e student's chosen degree plan by the degree-granting college once the student has been accepted into the college as a declared major. Students who apply to UHD while they are attending another institution must submit two official transcripts. The first should be sent at the time of application and should reflect t he student's current enrollment. A second must be sent as soon as grades are available for those classes. Transferring Credits from Other Countries Students applying for admission with college credits from other countries must submit an evaluated transcript from a credential evaluation service recognized by the university. Credits will be granted based on the recommendations of the evaluating service with respect to University of Houston-Downtown degree requirements at the time of enrollment. Information and brochures from evaluat ing services are available at the Office of Admissions and online at ww.uhd.edu/admissions. Transfer Credit Dispute Resolution Procedures Students who receive written notification from Office of Admissions that a lower-level course taken at another Texas public institution of higher education has not been accepted may challenge denial of credit by UHD. To initiate a dispute action, a Transfer Dispute Resolution form must be completed. The form and instructions for its completion are available in the Office of the Vi ce President for Academic Affairs, Room 950-South. Credit by Examination UHD accepts up to 24 hours of credit by examination. Credit by examination may be obtained on the basis of several types of examinations. Nationally recogniz ed standardized examinations such as the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and the College Board's Advanced Placement prog ram may be used. Examinations widely used within a professional field and locally designed examinations also may be used. Students may not attempt to receive credit by exam for any course in which they are or have been enrolled at an accredited institution; however, students may attempt credit by examination for courses in which they are or have been enrolled at a non-accredited institution. Students planning to take CLEP exams should do so before their final semester. Nationally standardized examinations are administered through Testing Services; all other examinat ions are administered through the responsible department. If credit is not awarded, a period of six months must elapse before application for re-examination will be considered. Appropriate fees are charged for each examination. No student may attempt the exam for a particular course more than twice. Credit may be granted for professional certification and training received from armed forces and serv ice schools. With consent of the appropriate dean, the chair of the department in which the student is majoring will make the decision conc erning the applicability of such courses to the degree program. Credit received by examination does not fulfill residency requirements for graduation. No grade is awarded for courses for which credit has been obtained by exam, nor are hours received for such courses included in the calculation of grade point average fo r graduation. Listed below are the subject examinations for the Ad vanced Placement Program and the College Level Examination Program.

This type of study is intended to expand the curriculum and may not duplicate an organized course. A directed studies course requires a term paper, research study or comparable project. Students wishing to enroll in a directed studies course must be juniors or seniors and have a grade point average of at least 3.0, with a grade point average of at least 3.3 in the specific area of the directed studies course. Procedures for enrolling in directed studies courses are available in each academic department. Degree requirements may limit the number of hours of directed studies that may be applied. Auditing Courses To audit a course is to enroll in a course on a noncredit basis. Audit students pay the regular tuition and all other applicable fees as set forth in the current Catalog. Senior citizens 65 years or over may audit free on a space-available basis. A c hange to credit status may not be made after the student has registered to audit a course. Changes from credit status to audit status in a course must be made prior to the end of the Official Day of Record. A Request for Audit form must be processed in the Registrar's Office by the Official Day of Record for the appropriate term. Students wishing to audit courses should contact the Registrar's Office for further details. Grading System and Standards Academic Honesty The Academic Honesty Code is embraced by all members of the University of Houston-Downtown academic community and is an essential element of the institution's academic credibility. The Honesty Code states \"We will be honest in a ll our academic activities and will not tolerate dishonesty.\" The purp ose of the Academic Honesty Policy is to deal with alleged violations of the Honesty Code in a fair and consistent manner. The policy is administered jointly by students and faculty. It is each student's res ponsibility to read and understand the Academic Honesty Policy. It may be found in the Student Handbook . Grading System The following grades are included in the calculation of grade point averages: Grade Grade Points A Superior ...................................................................................... 4.0 B Above Average........................................................................... 3.0 C Average ...................................................................................... 2.0 D Below Average ........................................................................... 1.0 F Failure ........................................................................................ 0.0 The following grades are not included in the calculation of grade point averages: Grade Audit S ....................................................................... Satisfacto ry (passing) U ............................................................. Unsatisfactory (not passing) W .......................................................................................... Withdraw I (Incomplete) An incomplete grade is given only when an unforeseen emergency prevents a student from completing the course work and only with the instructor's approval. A grade of I will be changed to a passing grade if the missing work is completed satisfactorily by the deadline set by the instructor but no later than the end of the long semester immediately following the term in which the grade was received. An incomplete grade that is not removed by this deadline becomes an F. Repetition of a course for which an incomplete grade was received does not affect resolution of the original grade. An incomplete grade earned in a student's graduating semester is computed as an F in determining grade point average. IP (In Progress) The grade of IP may be given in some developmental courses and the Writing Proficiency Exam. In the ca lculation of grade point average, a grade of IP is treated as a W. To receive credit for a course in which an IP was assigned, a student must register for the course again and earn a passing grade. S (Satisfactory) The grade of S may be earned in field experience courses and certain other courses. Credit received with a grade of S is not part of the grade point average calculation. W (Withdrawal from Courses) Students will not receive a grade if they withdraw from a course by the Official Day of Record. 23Students automatically receive a grade of W for any course from which they withdraw after the Official Day of Record but before the end of Thursday of the 10th week during a long term and Thursday of the fourth week during a summer term. Official Day of Record and withdrawal deadlines are published in the University Calendar online (www.uhd.edu/AcademicCalendars) and may be found in the Registration & Information Bulletin . Class days are defined as days on which the university has one or more classes scheduled; not the days for which an individual student is scheduled for his/her particular classes. Additional policies applicable to graduate students are published in the specific master's degree handbooks. Grade Point Average (GPA) The grade point average is a measure of a student's academic achievement. Grade point averages ar e computed by multiplying the grade point value by the number of credit hours in each course, and then dividing the sum of all grade points obtained by the total number of hours attempted. The following formula represents the method of computing grade point average: Total Number of Grade Points Total Number of Semester Hours = Grade Point Average The number of grade points earned for each course equals the hour credit value of the course multiplied by the points awarded for grades received. Grades of I, S, U, IP and grades marked with an asterisk (*) in the table above are not counted in the calculation of the grade point average, except for graduation. Gr ades of I will be calculated as F grades in determining grade point average for graduation. Undergraduate students must meet a graduation requirement of a minimum 2.0 grade point average calculated on all grades earned at UHD. Some departments may specify more stringent requirements, such as a 2.5 grade point average in the major or a 2.5 grade point average in all upper-level courses. Graduate students must meet a graduation requirement of a minimum 3.0 grade point average. Appeal of Grades Any grade which a student believes to be in error should be appealed, first to the instructor, then to the appropriate department chair, and finally to the appropriate dean. If an appeal is not made within one calendar year after the close of the semester in which the grade was received, the grade will be considered final and no appeal is allowed. Dean's List The Dean's List recognizes st udents who have achieved superior academic performance during the fall or spring semester. To be included on the Dean's List for a specific semester, a student must, during that semester, complete at least nine semester hours of college- level work, earn at least a 3.5 grade point average, and receive no grade of I or F. The Dean's List is published by the Provost's Office at the end of each fall and spring semester. Repeated Course Policy When a course is repeated, the last grade received in the course will be used in computing the grade point average. Graduation with Honors Students who complete bachelor's degree requirements with exceptionally high grade point aver ages receive degrees with honors. Those who earn a cumulative grade point average of 3.75-4.00 graduate summa cum laude , while a cumulative grade point average of 3.50-3.74 is required for magna cum laude . A grade point average of 3.25-3.49 is needed to graduate cum laude . In the computation of this average, all courses attempted at UHD are counted, including courses repeated, failed and passed, but excluding courses with grades of S, W or IP. For candidates who complete some portion of their college work at other institutions, the cumulative grade point average of all work attempted at UHD and the grade point average of all college work is computed; the lower of the two averages is used as the basis for determining honors. Students not eligible for cum laude, magna cum laude or summa cum laude honors may be eligible for College Honors. Students who have earned a GPA of 3.50 or greater in their last 60 hours attempted at UHD, including at least 30 upper-level hour s, are eligible to receive the designation, \"College Honors.\" Academic Probation and Suspension Probation Academic probation is a warning to the student that his or her aca- demic record has been unsatisfactory. A student who is not making satisfactory progress toward meeting graduation requirements may be placed on academic suspension if th is record does not improve. A student is placed on academic probation at the end of any term in which his or her cumulative GPA falls below the specified minimum cumulative GPA shown below. The cumulative GPA for academic probation and suspension is computed on all grades earned at UHD. Grades of I, IP, S or W are not counted. Semester hours Minimum Required Cumulative GPA 1-29 1.70 30-59 1.90 60 or more, or upon declaration of a major 2.00 Transfer students on suspension from their most recent institution of higher education will be placed on ac ademic probation if admitted to UHD. Students will remain on academic probation until their cumulative GPA reaches the specified minimum cu mulative GPA or until they are suspended. Only courses taken at UHD may be counted in removing a student from academic probation. Suspension Suspension means that a student is ineligible to register or remain in classes. Students on academic probation will be suspended at the end of any term in which their cumulative GPA falls below the specified 24minimum cumulative GPA unless they earn a minimum GPA of 2.0 in that term. A student's first academic suspensi on will become effective at the beginning of the next term and will remain in effect for that term only. The student may be granted earlier readmission at the discretion of the student's academic dean or the dean' s designated representative. The second time a student is pl aced on academic suspension, the length of the suspension will be indefinite. The student may be con-sidered for readmission after one term and only upon appeal to the students' academic dean or the dean' s designated representative. The third time a student is pl aced on academic suspension, the suspension will be permanent. Any appeals for readmission following a permanent suspension must be initiated at the academic dean's office. The final decision rests with the Vi ce President for Academic Affairs and Provost. Academic Amnesty After a four-year absence, a student returning to UHD may petition his or her academic dean for academic amnesty. To be eligible, the student must not have attended any institution of higher education for the four-year period immediately preceding readmission to UHD. In addition, the student also must complete 24 semester credit hours with a minimum grade point average of 2.5 following readmission. The amnesty provision applies only to the application of credit toward a degree and computation of the student's grade point average. No grades on the student's permanent record are altered or deleted. If academic amnesty is granted, all courses with grades of F or D earned prior to readmission are ignored in applying credit toward fulfillment of degree requirements and in future computations of the student's grade point average. A student granted academic amnesty relinquishes all rights to graduation with honors and any other academic recognition based on grade point average. Student Records Transcripts Requests for official or student copi es of transcripts are made to the Registrar's Office. Requests for UHD transcripts may be made online or by mail. All requested transcr ipts will be processed within 2 business days during the semester and within 3 business days during peak registration and grade proce ssing periods. Please note that business days exclude University holidays and/or weekends Any official transcripts submitt ed to UHD from other institutions become the property of UHD. If you have any questions or have not received your transcript, please c ontact the Registrar's Office. Release of Student Records UHD has a policy in conformity with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) covering the release of student records. Student rights include the following: x Students have the right to inspect and review their education records within 45 days of the day the university receives the request. x Students have the right to request amendment of their education records that they believe are inaccurate or misleading. x Students have the right to consent to the disclosure of personally identifiable information in their ed ucation records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. x Students have the right to file a complaint with the US Department of Education concerning alleged failure s by the university to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Directory Information At its discretion the University of Houston-Downtown may provide directory information to the general public without student consent. Directory information is defined by University of Houston-Downtown (within the guidelines of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974) as follows: Student's name Mailing address Telephone number University assigned e-mail address Date and place of birth Classification Enrollment status Major and minor fields of study Degrees, certificates, awards and honors received Dates of attendance Graduation date Expected graduation date Student's user name Most recent previous education institution attended Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Weight and height of members of athletic teams Students may request that directory information be withheld from the public by contacting the Registrar' s Office at any time during the semester. Such requests must be made in writing and will remain in place until the student directs the office in writing that it is to be removed. Disclosure of Education Records In accordance with FERPA and at its discretion, UHD will disclose information from a student's education records without the written consent of the student to school officials who have a legitimate educational or administrative interest in the records. A school official is defined as a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, or suppor t staff position (including the university's police department and health care staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Regents; or a person assisting another school official in performing his or her official duties. Procedure for Inspecting Education Records A student has the right to inspect his or her education records and challenge the contents. To review records, a student must make a request in writing to the Registrar's Office. The request must identify the record or records he or she wishes to inspect. 25Procedure for Amending Education Records If a student believes the information in his or her education record contains information that is inaccura te, misleading, or in violation of the student's rights of privacy, the stu dent should submit a written request for amendment to the registrar. The request should clearly identify and correct the inaccuracy. The university will notify the student within a reasonable time regarding the reques t. If the request for amendment is denied the student has the right to a hearing. This procedure does not govern grade appeals. Change of Name and Address Change in name must be reported to the Registrar's Office and to the Financial Aid Office if applicable. Or iginal legal documentation must be presented along with a copy of the Social Security card when requesting a name change or correction, i.e. marriage certificate, divorce decree, naturalization certific ate, etc. The Registrar's Office will also need to make a copy of your state issued driver's license or government issued photo ID. Addresses may also be changed online through Student e-Services at www.uhd.edu/eservices. Graduation Requirements General Degree Requirements for Graduation For degree completion, at least 25% of the semester credit hours must be earned through instruction offered by UHD. In addition to completion of specific degree requirements, all students must meet the requirements described below. The final 30 semester credit hours of course work toward the degree must be taken at the University of Houston-Downtown. At least 18 of these hours must be at the upper level and be approved by the student's major department. Only the appropriate academic dean may waive any portion of these requirements and only upon petition by a student who has extraordinary reasons. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 calculated on all grades earned at UHD is required for graduation. In addition, a grade point average of 2.0 is required for all courses taken at UHD that apply toward the degree. Students enrolled in any degree program at the University of Houston-Downtown who wish to take courses at another college or university (including any other institution in the UH System) and apply the credits toward the degree should consult with their degree program officer to be sure the courses apply to their degree program. A student taking courses under these provisions is responsible for having an official transcript from the second campus fo rwarded the Office of Admissions at UHD. The student also must request that an official evaluation of this transcript be made and reported to the appropriate degree program officer. Graduation under a Specific Catalog A student usually graduates under the degree provisions of the Catalog in effect at the time of his or her first completed term of enrollment; where enrollment is defined as registration for and completion of at least one course. Students have the option of graduating under the Catalog in effect at the time of their major declaration or any subsequent Catalog. If degree requirements change during the time of the student's enrollment, the student may be required to meet the new degree requirements if the number of hours the student must take has not increased. Exceptions: No Catalog more than 10 years old may be used. Students who interrupt their program for more than two consecutive long semesters for reasons other than military service shall be governed by the Catalog in effect at the time of re-entry to the university. Students whose enrollment is interrupted by military service must re- enroll within one year from date of separation from the service and no more than five years from the beginning of military service in order to remain under the provisions of the Catalog in effect at the time of original enrollment at the university. Students forced to withdraw for adequate cause before completion of their degree may upon readmission petition to graduate under the Catalog in effect at the time of original enrollment. Students who change their major shall be governed by the Catalog in effect at the time of the change. Application for Graduation All degree candidates must file an app lication for graduation with their college and pay the $50 graduation fee by the second Monday after the last day to drop a course without a grade (the Official Day of Record) for the term of intended graduation. The graduation fee covers the costs of processing the graduati on application, printing the diploma and mailing it to the graduate, and other costs associated with the commencement ceremony. If students fail to complete all degree requirements during the term in which they applied for graduation and paid the graduation fee, then they must apply for graduation and pay the graduation fee again when they become eligible to graduate. Candidates must also place a diplom a order, which specifies how they want their name to appear on the diploma, with the Registrar's Office. Commencement Exercises To participate in commencement exer cises, students must be enrolled in the courses needed to complete all degree requirements and must file an application for graduation with their college, and pay the graduation fee by the second Monday after the last day to drop a course without a grade (the Official Day of Record) for the term of intended graduation. The final decisi on on eligibility for graduation and participation in commencement exercises rests with the appropriate academic dean. Commencement participants with honors are so designated in the commencement program and wear specia l insignia with their academic regalia. As commencement occurs prior to the posting of final grades, the designation of honors for May and December commencement participants reflects only grades ear ned prior to the final semester. Designation of final honors on the transcript and diploma, however, is based on all work attempted. Arrangements for obtaining academic regalia may be made through the university bookstore. Deadlines for ordering and paying for regalia 26are announced for each commencement. Additional Bachelor's Degree To qualify for a second UHD bachelor 's degree, the candidate must: earn a minimum of 30 semester hours credit more than needed to receive the degree requiring the fewest hours; meet the general and specific requirements for each degree; and have 30 semester hours of residence credit at UHD for each degree awarded by the university. 27Undergraduate Academic Programs General Education The granting of a college degree signi fies having reached a level of intellectual development that merits formal recognition. Intellectual development can be measured both in terms of depth and breadth of knowledge, and a college degree should signify growth in both dimensions. In most college programs, students demonstrate depth of knowledge by completing courses required in the major field of study. Breadth of knowledge is demonstrated by satisfying a group of general education requirements that are shared by students in all majors. Whereas the aim of the major field of study is to provide experiences defining membership in a disciplinary community, the aim of the general education program is to provi de experiences that define what it means to be a college-educated pers on. The centerpiece of the general education program is called the \"core curriculum\" because these courses comprise the core of the college experience. The goals of UH-Downtown's general education program are that graduates will demonstrate: The ability to view events from a variety of perspectives, especially including different historical and cultural perspectives; An awareness of the different ways of pursuing knowledge, including the methods of scientists and of those engaged in the arts and humanities; Knowledge of, and sensitivity to, ethical and moral standards; Knowledge of, and a degree of skill with, new technologies; The ability to communicate clearly and effectively and to use various media to transmit and process information. In order to achieve these goals, t he general education component of all degrees earned at UH-Downtown cons ists of four parts: courses satisfying the common core requirements, application course requirements, enhancement course requirements, and the Writing Proficiency Examination. Each of these components is described below: Common Core Requirements Students in all UH-Downtown undergraduate degree programs must complete a common core of courses consisting of at least 42 semester credit hours. If any course taken to fulfill a core requirement has a corequisite, the corequisite course must be taken concurrently. For instance, if a student chose to fulfill the Natural Sciences requirement by taking BIOL 1301, the corequisite lab course, BIOL 1101, would also have to be taken in the same semester. The following table lists the disciplinary components of the core, the number of semester credit hours (SCHs) required in each component, and the UH-Downtown courses that may be used to fulfill these requirements. Departments often suggest certain courses that they prefer their majors to take to fulfill some of the core requirements, so students should carefully study the degree plans that interest them. Degree plans may be found in the sections of this Catalog describing the departments' programs and in degree program brochures available in departmental offices. A student transferring to UHD who has completed the common core requirements at another Texas institution of higher education will receive credit for each of the core courses transferred and will be considered to have fully satisfied all of UHD's common core requirements. A student transferring to UHD who has completed some, but not all, of the common core requirements at another Texas institution of higher education will receive credit for each of the core courses transferred and will be considered to have fully satisfied the corresponding common core requirements at UHD. The student must still satisfy any remaining UHD common core requirements. Students concurrently enrolled at more than one institution of higher education should follow the core curriculum requirements in effect for the institution where they are cl assified as degree-seeking students. DISCIPLINARY COMPONENTS SCHs UHD COURSE OPTIONS Communication English composition 6 ENG 1301, 1302 Speech 3 MATH course numbered 1301 or higher Natural Sciences 6 Two 3-hour courses from BIOL, CHEM, GEOL, MBIO, NS or PHYS that include lab hours or have corequisite 1-hour labs. Humanities & Visual & Performing Arts Fine Arts 3 One course from ART, DRA, MUS Literature 3 Any literature course Social & Behavioral Sciences US History 6 Two courses from HIST 1305, 1306, 2303, 2309 Political Science 6 1400; HUM 2305 Total Hours 42-43 Time Frame for Completing Common Core Requirements The common core of the general education program is designed to provide students with the academic skills and knowledge that constitute the foundation of a baccalaureate education. The spe- cialized course work taken in the major field of study builds upon this foundation, so it is necessary for students to complete core requirements early in their course of study. Writing and computational skills are especially critical for future academic success. Therefore, in the first semester in which they are eligible to do so, students must enroll in the courses that will satisfy the English composition/rhetoric requirement (ENG 1301 and ENG 1302), and the courses that will satisfy the mathematics requirement (any 28 MATH course numbered 1301 or higher), and students must continue to enroll in these courses until they have been successfully completed. Students are encouraged to complete all other common core requirements before enrolling in any upper-division (3000-level and 4000-level) courses. Students may not take the writing skills courses within their major until they have successfully completed the Writing Proficiency Examination. Application Course Requirements The application course requirements are intended to ensure that the communication and analytical skills learned in common core courses are applied and further developed. App lication courses are required in the following two areas: Writing Skills In addition to the common core requirements in English composition and literature, students must take two upper-division courses that include substantial written assignment s. These courses, designated as \"W courses\" in degree programs, assure students of opportunities to use and further refine their writing skills within the context of the major field of study. Nonverbal Analytical Skills In addition to the common core requirements in mathematics and computer literacy, students must take one course that makes use of the skills learned in these core course s to solve problems related to the major field of study. These course s are designated as \"S courses\" in degree programs. Enhancement Course Requirements Enhancement courses represent another way in which certain objectives of the general education program are embedded in courses beyond those in the common core. Each degree program includes certain courses that (1) give signi ficant emphasis to ethical and moral issues, and (2) engender in students a greater appreciation of their membership in a world community marked by vast diversities of every type. Writing Proficiency Examination All students must take and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination after completing 60 semester credit hours and before completing 75 semester credit hours. Transfer students with 75 or more hours must attempt the examination during their first semester at the university. The purposes of the examination are to determine if students have retained the language skills learned in their lower-division composition courses, and to ensure that students proceeding to upper-division work possess college-level writing skills.

Academic Requirements Consistent with the University of Houston-Downtown's commitment to quality undergraduate education, the College of Business adopts this policy regarding admissions, the dec laration of majors, course enrollment and requirements for graduation for BBA degree programs. Admission and Declaration of Major Effective January 10, 2010, current students and new transfer students must have a GPA of 2.50 or higher to declare their major in the College of Business. Students currently enrolled at UHD with a GPA of 2.50 or higher on all work at UHD may apply for admission to the College of Business and simultaneously declare a major in business if the following requirements are met: completion of 42 hours of the common core requirements, completion of College Algebra with a \"C\" or higher, satisfactory completion of Texas Success Initiative (TSI) requirements, and no transcript or cashier holds. Joint-Admission community college/UHD students with a GPA of 2.50 or higher at the college/university most recently attended may apply for admission to the College of Business and simultaneously declare a major in business if the following requirements are met: completion of the 42 hours of common core requirements, completion of College Algebra with a \"C\" or higher, satisfactory completion of TSI requirements, and no transcript or cashier holds. New transfer students with a GPA of 2.50 or higher at the college/university most recently attended may apply for admission to the College of Business and simultaneously declare a major in business if the following requirements are met: completion of 42 hours of the common core requirements, completion of College Algebra with a \"C\" or higher, satisfactory completion of TSI requirements, and no transcript or cashier holds. Denial of Admission Students with a GPA of less than 2.50 at the last college or university attended do not qualify for admission to the College of Business and must meet with University Coll ege advisors for course approvals. Post-Baccalaureate and Special Status Admission Students who hold bachelors or graduate degrees from accredited universities who are not seeking a degree from the University of Houston-Downtown may apply for admission to the College of Business as post-baccalaureate students prior to enrolling at the University of Houston-Downtown. Students who desire to take courses offered by the College of Business which have been approved by external certification agencies to fulfill their continuing education requirements may apply for admission to the College of Business as special status students. In order to qualify, the applicant must have at least 60 hours of university credit. Additionally, the student must satisfy TSI requirements if applicable. Courses taken by a special status student may not be used to fulfill degree requirements of any degree granted by the College of Business. Transient students who need to take one or more business classes at UHD to complete their degree at another university must obtain prior written approval from their dean to enroll in specific courses which will be used to satisfy graduation requirements. Satisfaction of Prerequisites Prerequisites are NOT optional; pr erequisites ARE requirements or courses that must be completed PRIOR to taking a course. The prerequisites for a course are described in the catalog course descriptions. It is the student's responsibility to insure that he/she meets the prerequisites prior to enrollment in a course. If the student enrolls and does not meet the prerequisites, he/she may be administratively withdrawn from the course at any time. The administrative withdrawal will result in NO REFUND of tuition and fees because it appears that the student k nowingly enrolled in the course in violation of catalog requirements. Any variance in prerequisite requirements or this policy must be obtained in writing from the department chair prior to enrollment in the course. Dismissal from the College of Business Students admitted to the College of Business whose overall GPA falls below 2.0 for two consecutive se mesters will be placed on academic suspension in accordance with the current UHD Catalog. Students on academic suspension will be dismissed from the College of Business. A student who changes his/her major to a discipline outside of the College of Business will be dismissed from the College of Business 31 and their records will be forwarded to the appropriate college. A student who is unsuccessful in a required course after three attempts will be dismissed from the College of Business for failure to progress. College of Business interprets a required course as any course in the Business Core or Major Requirements. Finally, the College of Business will interpret failure to progress as not moving forward in a degree plan. Therefore, in some majors a \"D\" in a course will be considered unsuccessful if the degree sequence requires a C or better. An attempt is registered when the student receives either a grade or \"W\" for the course. If a student subsequently seeks readmission to the College of Business, she/he must reapply and meet the College of Business standards of admission in force at the time of reapplication. Course Approvals and Advising All students admitted to the College of Business will be advised by College of Business advisors. Students with declared majors will be granted self-advising privileges as long as their GPA is 2.25 or above and prerequisites are followed. Students who fail to follow prerequisite requirements will be denied self-advis ing privileges. This provision applies to students who have not completed the 18 hours of required lower division business core classes in MATH, ACC and ECO before attempting upper division courses, have not passed the Writing Proficiency Examination, or do not follow advisors' directions. Students who fail to file a declaration of major when eligible will be denied enrollment in courses administered by the College of Business until the declaration has been filed. Students not admitted to the College of Business who want to enroll in upper division business courses must have an overall GPA of 2.00 or higher, must meet all the prerequisites for the courses, and must have prior written approval of a College of Business advisor or a designated delegate. The only course that does not require prior written approval of a College of Business advisor is BA 3300 (Business Cornerstone). Students not admitted to the College of Business (non Business majors) will be restricted to no more than 18 hours of upper division Business courses. Students seek ing more than 18 hours must received written permission from the Dean of the College of Business. Graduation Requirements In addition to meeting the general requirements established by the University of Houston-Downtown for eligibility to graduate, students receiving a degree in a program administered by the College of Business must have an overall GPA of 2.0 or better for all courses taken in the College of Business The final 30 semester credit hours of course work toward the degree must be taken at UH-Downtown. Prior to that time, students who wish to take junior- and senior-level c ourses at another college or university, including any other campus of the UH System, and apply the credits earned toward their degree, must request approval through the College of Business Advising Office in R oom B101. Courses taken without such approval will not be counted toward the fulfillment of degree requirements. For degree completion, at least 25% of the semester credit hours must be earned through instruction offered by UHD. Additionally, all of the last 30 hours must be in upper division course work taken at UH-Downtown Only the Dean of the College of Business may waive any portion of these requirements. Courses of Instruction Individual courses of instruction ar e subject to change or cancellation at any time and may not be offered each semester or every year. Students should be especially mindful that summer offerings are limited and vary from year to year. Therefore, careful planning is required if progress toward the de gree is expected during the summer months. Field Experience Field Experience integrates theory learned in the classroom with practical work experience in a job related to the student's academic and professional goals. The work experience and the academic experience must be directly related. Positions may or may not be paid and may last the duration of the fall or spring semester or the entire summer. Field Experience generally is not approved for students already employed in their area of study. Eligibility for Field Experience enro llment includes at least 60 semester credit hours completed in the degree program, a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or prior approval of the department chair in whose area the course is being offe red. Other requirements specified by the department may impact the applicant's eligibility. Submission of applications and other preliminary procedures should be completed during the semester prior to the one in which the student wishes to enroll. The College of Business allows up to two courses (6 semester credit hours) in Field Experience to be applied toward graduation requirements. These courses are graded on a pass/fail basis and do not apply toward calculation of the grade point average. Field Experience credit may NOT be used to satisfy minor program requirements with the exception of the IRM minor. Minor Program Requirements Additionally, the College of Business offers a variety of minors to complement major programs. Both students pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration degree and those pursuing other degrees offered by the university can select these minors. Students planning to take a minor in the College of Business who are not seeking a Bachelor of Business Administration degree are reminded that in compliance with the accrediting principles of AACSB-International, the course work taken in the College of Business, including all courses applicable to the minor, is limited to 25% of the credit hours applied toward graduation.

Mission Statement The Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sc iences with a major in Applied Administration (BAAS-AA) is designed to offer students that have completed the Associate of Applied Science degree (AAS) the opportunity to develop competencies, skills, and the foundation preparation for promotion to upper level administrative and supervisory positions in organizations. Through the completion of the BAAS in Applied Administration, the student is provided the opportunity to acquire knowledge in the areas of program planning and evaluat ion, supervision and leadership, human resources, budgeting, interpersonal communication skills, change management, information systems, and the development of technology for use in organizational processes. This degree will provide the skills and knowledge for upward mobility into supervisory and administrative positions. Program Administration The Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sc iences with a major in Applied Administration is a freestanding progr am attached to the College of Business for administrative purposes onl y. It is a separate and distinct program from BBA programs in the College of Business. Students in the BBAS in Applied Administration may not enroll in courses in the College of Business BBA programs. Likewise, students in College of Business BBA programs may not enroll in BAAS in Applied Administration courses. Academic Requirements Consistent with the University of Houston-Downtown's commitment to quality undergraduate education, the BAAS in Applied Administration Program adopts this policy regard ing admissions, the declaration of majors, course enrollment and requirements for graduation for the BAAS in Applied Administration degree. Admission and Declaration of Major Students who have a GPA of 2.5 or higher at UHD or the last institution attended may be admitted to the BAAS in Applied Administration If they meet the following criteria: Completion of an AAS degree from a community college, Satisfactory completion of Texas Success Initiative (TSI) requirements, and No transcript or cashier holds. Students may declare their major in Applied Administration if they meet the above criteria. Denial of Admission Students with a GPA of less than 2.50 at the last college or university attended do not qualify for admission to the BAAS in Applied Administration and must meet with University College advisors for course approvals. 41 Satisfaction of Prerequisites Prerequisites are NOT optional; pr erequisites ARE requirements or courses that must be completed PRIOR to taking a course. The prerequisites for a course are described in the catalog course descriptions. It is the student's responsibility to insure that he/she meets the prerequisites prior to enrollment in a course. If the student enrolls and does not meet the prerequisites, he/she may be administratively withdrawn from the course at any time. The administrative withdrawal will result in NO REFUND of tuition and fees because it appears that the student k nowingly enrolled in the course in violation of catalog requirements. Any variance in prerequisite requirements or this policy must be obtained in writing from the department chair prior to enrollment in the course. Dismissal from the BAAS-AA Program Students admitted to the BAAS in Applied Administration whose overall GPA falls below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters will be placed on academic suspension in a ccordance with the current UHD Catalog.

Students who fail to follow prerequisite requirements will be denied self-advis ing privileges. This provision applies to students who have not completed the 42 hour Common Core, have not passed the Writing Pr oficiency Examination, or do not follow advisors' directions. Students who fail to file a declaration of major when eligible will be denied enr ollment in courses administered by the BAAS-AA Program until the declaration has been filed. Graduation Requirements In addition to meeting the general requirements established by the University of Houston-Downtown for eligibility to graduate, students receiving a degree in the BAAS-AA pr ogram must have an overall GPA of 2.0 or better for all courses taken in the BAAS-AA program.

Bachelor of Science Major in Interdisciplinary Studies Barbara Canetti-Rios, MA, Coordinator Room 1014-South, 713-221-8460 The Bachelor of Science with a ma jor in Interdisciplinary Studies permits students to select, from am ong UHD's offerings in the arts and sciences, those courses that most interest them, and to present 27 upper-level semester credit hours of those courses as their major and 9 upper-level semester credit hour s as an area concentration. The degree shares the basic core curriculum with other degrees and includes a distribution of cour ses to ensure a good academic foundation. Because the degree includes a large number of elective courses, it is often a suitable degree completion alternative for transfer students or students who have discovered that they are no longer interested in a previous major.

Department of Social Sciences Adolfo Santos , PhD, Chair Room 1009-North, 713-221-8014 Faculty Professors: Christian, Fairbanks, McCaffrey Associate Professors: Allen, Al varez, Anderson, Wright Academic Areas: anthropology, geography, history, philosophy, political science, psychology, sociology, social work Mission and Objectives The Department of Social Sciences is an interdisciplinary department. Faculty teach courses and conduct research in seven academic areas: anthropology, geography, history, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology. In additi on to classes in these disciplines, we offer interdisciplinary classes in the social sciences. Currently, eight degrees may be taken in our department: History (BA), Philosophy (BA), Political Science (BS), Psychol ogy (BS), Sociology (BS), Social Sciences (BA or BS), Social Work ( BSW). Please come visit us, or call and talk with us about your interests and plans. 52 The department's educational philos ophy is holistic, emphasizing the importance of educational and professional growth both inside and outside of the classroom. Our degree programs prepare students in a number of ways: students are provided wi th job skills relevant to their career aspirations, a readiness for graduate or professional school, and a strong, broad-based background in the liberal arts which is important in the ever-changing so cial and economic environment. The essential components of the department's mission are community- based research and public service, and these also constitute integral parts of the department's educational program. All of the department's degree programs are designed to develop skills in research and analysis. Students also are strongly encouraged to engage in internships, volunteer service activi ties, or other degree-related work experiences in which classroom t heory can be applied to \"real-life\" problems. The study and practice of the soci al sciences provide the means for students to unify their learning, since the social sciences, in attempting to understand human individuals and institutions, employ both the methodologies of the linguistically -oriented humanistic disciplines and the empirically-based natural sciences . Thus our unique contribution to the intellectual life of the university is to provide the arena in which all viewpoints can meet and exchange.

Phil Bossert , Commander The Air Force Reserve Officer Trai ning (ROTC) program prepares men and women of character, commitment, and courage to assume leadership positions as commissioned o fficers in the active duty United States Air Force. Upon completion of the curriculum, students will have a thorough understanding of the core values, leadership, teamwork, and other requirements to be an effective officer in the US Air Force. All courses and physical training sessi ons take place at the University of Houston. Flight orientation occurs at airports in the Houston metro area. Course Credit ROTC classes may be taken for elective credit toward any degree plan at the University of Houston-Downtown. Freshman and sophomore level classes are open to all students. No military obligation is incurred as a result of enrollment in these courses. Junior and senior level courses are more restrictive and do r equire a military obligation. ROTC scholarship students also incur a military obligation. Four-Year Program The General Military Course (GMC) is the first half of the four-year ROTC program and is taken during the freshman and sophomore years. This program allows the student to experience Air Force ROTC without obligation (unless the student is on an Air Force ROTC scholarship). Each semester of the GMC consists of one classroom hour of instruction as well as Leadership Laboratory each week. During the first two years, the student will learn about the Air Force and the historical development of aero space power. During the summer preceding the junior year, the student will compete for the opportunity to attend a four-week Field Training Unit. Successful completion of field training is mandatory for entr ance into the Professional Officer Course (POC), the junior and senior years of the four-year program. As a junior, the student will study the core values, leadership, teamwork, and management tools required to become an effective Air Force officer. During the senior year students study the national security policy process, regional and cultural studi es, and complete final requirements for commissioning as second lieutenants. Enrollment in the POC is open to graduate students if they have four semesters of school remaining. Each semester of the POC consists of three classroom hours of instruction as well as Leadership Laboratory each week. Leadership Laboratory As an Air Force ROTC cadet, each student is required to attend an additional two-hour class known as Leadership Laboratory. Although not part of the academic class requirement, it is an essential element of officer training. Leade rship Laboratory is an intensive, military training program in which students gain invaluable leadership and managerial experience while lear ning about the Air Force way of life. Students have numerous opportuni ties to hear guest speakers and panel discussions participate in fiel d trips, and experience practical leadership exercises., AFROTC Scholarship Opportunities Air Force ROTC offers various schol arship opportunities for students at the University of Houston-Downtown: In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP) \u2014is a highly competitive scholarship program aimed primarily at college freshmen and sophomores in any major (students with a bachelor's degree can compete to earn a master's degree).

Professional Development and field-based courses in this department are taught in three Interdisciplinary Blocks (9 hours eac h) and are field-based in selected public schools within several Houston metropolitan area districts. Field- based blocks of courses also require a minimum of 60 clock hours of internship/fieldwork (per semester) in these schools on weekdays between 7:00 AM and 3:30 PM. Building upon an understanding of cultural, economic, and linguistic diversity developed through t he program's general education requirements and its Urban Education Core, the Interdisciplinary Blocks provide opportunities for future teachers to: observe and interact with mast er teachers and divergent learners within the school setting interact with children of diverse backgrounds and experiences to create an understanding of themselves, their own culture, and the cultures of others develop a community of lear ners which acknowledges the similarities of diverse member s and appreciates differences plan and implement effective st rategies which ensure academic success for all learners, and use technology in effective ways to enhance student achievement. To promote and ensure student success, the design of the curriculum is based on (a) state certification standards, (b) the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills, and (c) th e state teacher education proficiencies. It is expected that at the end of the teacher education program, the new teacher will have internalized the state identified proficiencies for teacher education and will successfully pass the state examinations required for teacher certification.

The ACP option starts in the spring and fall semesters of each academic year. The application deadline for the Alternative Certification Program is: Fall Start - June 1 st and Spring Start - November 1st. The successful completion of all components of the ACP program is required before students are recommended for full certification. Please see the Ur ban Education website for more 66 information. The Master of Arts in Teaching wi th certification (MAT-ACP) option allows students to work toward teacher certification and a Master of Arts in teaching (Curriculum and In struction). The application deadline for the MAT-ACP program is: Fall Start - June 1 st and Spring Start - November 1st. Students must submit completed applications for the Alternative Certification Program a nd the Master of Arts in Teaching program. Please see the Urban Education website for more information. A Post-Baccalaureate plan sponsored by the University of Houston-Downtown requires a minimum of 27-33 semester credit hours to be taken after the date of the student's bachelor's degree. All courses taken in fulfillment of the plan are to be taken at UHD unless the student has written permission in the form of a waiver from the Office of the Dean of Public Service. Students interested in obtaining an MAT with certification should refer to the graduate section of this catalog. Please note: As state guidelines change, continual program revisions may occur. Teacher education programs are developed in response to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) regulations and guidelines. Thus, course requirements and sequencing are subject to change. All students pursuing teacher certification plan s must understand that the advising staff will make every effort to communicate program changes as they occur, but it is the responsibility of each student to stay apprised of any changes that may affect degree plans . Thus constant monitoring of plans is necessary, and students are urged to visit regularly with an academic advisor and to check the SBEC website for teacher certification changes ( www.sbec.state.tx.us).

There will be a $10 late fee added for each install-ment payment not received by the due date. Installment payments are also available online thr ough Student e-Services under the My Payment option. Summer semesters - Two equal payments with the first payment plus a $16 installment fee to be made in advance of the beginning of the summer term and the final payment to be made before the last day of the term. There will be a $10 late fee added for each installment payment not received by the due date. Installment payments are also available online through Student e-Services under the My Payment option. Payment may be made by cash, check or credit card. Payment may be made in person, by mail, online (credit/debit card or echeck) or thru the payment drop box located in the hall next to the cashier's office on the third floor. Credit card payment (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover) may be made over the web via UHD's Student e-services (www.uhd.edu) or by fax to 713-226-5267. Please remember that mailed payments must be received by the posted payment deadlines to avoid havi ng classes dropped or late fees assessed. UHD does not receive mail on Saturday, so payments must be received by Friday for Saturday deadlines. Health Insurance fees shall be pai d prior to the beginning of the semester. Most financial aid awards will be credited to your account automatically once processing is completed and you are registered for the same number of hours for which you are awarded. It is the student's responsibility to check their fee statement to assure that their funds have been posted to their account before the payment deadline. If the funds have not been posted, the student must make the payment or other arrangements with the cashier office by the deadline to avoid losing their classes. Student fee statements can be viewed through UHD's Student e-services (www.uhd.edu), the My Payment option. Students receiving financial aid equal to, or in excess of, the total amount of tuition and fees prior to the beginning of the semester may not participate in the installment plan. The full payment of tuition and fees for the semester in which they are enrolled must be made upon issuance of that semester's fi nancial aid funds before any excess amounts will be refunded. Withdrawal from the university, for whatever reason, w ill not cancel the obligation to pay the full amount of the installment plan. If the amount of tuition and fees credited as a result of withdrawal is less than the remaining balance of an installment pl an, the balance remaining is still the obligation of the student. If the credited amount is more than the balance of an installment plan, the remaining credit will be refunded to the student. Any student who has elected to pay tuition and fees by installment, and who is delinquent in making payment by the final installment due date, is barred from registering at any institution in the University of Houston System until full payment, including delinquent charges, has been made. Each university maintains reco rds and informs other institutions about the status of payments should the student attempt to register for courses or pursue a degree at any other component of the University of Houston System. An additional default fee of $50 is collected from any student who fails to make all installment payments by the end of the semester. This fee, in addition to all other amounts due, must be paid prior to the student's registering for courses during a subsequent semester. Financial Responsibility Students are required to meet financial responsibilities to the university. Students who write checks to the university on accounts with insufficient funds are assessed a $20 service charge for each such check, regardless of the amount. If a check is returned as a result of bank error, the student must deal with the bank for reimbursement of the $20 returned check charge paid to the university. If such a check is presented in payment of tuition and fees, the return of the check could also result in charges of late fees, and if the check is not redeemed within 10 days, the student may be dropped from all classes. A student who does not meet financial responsibilities to the university may be subject to withdrawal from classes and may be referred to law enforcement authorities and/or the local credit bureau. Once an account is referred to our collection agency, the student is responsible for payment of additional collection fees. These fees are no less than 23% of the delinquent amount. An official transcript shall not be given to or on behalf of a student who is in default on any payment due the university. The student will not be allowed to re-enroll at the university until all past due payments have been made, and a reinstatement charge may be required before enrollment is approved. Refunds All refunds are made in accordance with the following rules and regulations: Concurrent Enrollment Under the provisions of Section 54.062 of the Texas Education Code, the university will refund to students excess tuition paid as a result of being concurrently enrolled at more than one Texas public institution of higher education. Excess tuition applies for students taking only 1 or 2 semester credit hours at UH-Downtown. To qualify the student must: register at UH-Downtown after registering at the first institution; provide the university proof of being concurrently enrolled and paid at both institutions; and provide the university proof of the amount of tuition paid at the first institution. All concurrent enrollment refund requests must be made in writing at the Business Affairs Office. Complete Withdrawal Students who officially withdraw from all university courses may be eligible for a refund of tuition and mandatory fees. Please refer to the current academic calendar for the refund schedule. All 100% refunds 92incur a $15 processing fee. Students who are withdrawing and who have received financial aid should cons ult the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. Partial Withdrawal Students who officially drop some but not all of their courses within the first 12 class days of the fall or spring semester, or within the first four days of a summer session, are eligible for a 100% refund of tuition and fees for the dropped classes. After this period there is no refund for partial withdrawals. Refunds resulting from dropped classes will not be processed until after the ADD/DROP period has ended. Students who are withdrawing and who have receiv ed financial aid should consult the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ALL REFUNDS All refunds are now processed through HigherOne, the issuer of your GatorCard. In order to receive a refund you MUST activate your GatorCard and choose one of the three refund methods. To activate your GatorCard, go to www.uhdgatorcard.com. If you have not received your card, you can click on the Where's My Card? link also at www.uhdgatorcard.com to see the status. No refund will be made to a student who has not met all financial obligations for the semester, including full payment of installment balances. If a student received financial aid, the refund may be credited to the appropriate financial aid account. The Registration & Information Bulletin provides specific dates and deadlines. If a balance is owed for a semester other than the semester due the refund, funds will not be automatically moved to cover that balance. If you were allowed to register with an outstanding balance or incurred a debt for a prior semester after you registered, you must pay that balance before you will be allowed to r egister for future semesters, received a transcript or a diploma. Scholarships and Financial Aid The University of Houston-Downtown offers a variety of financial aid programs to assist undergraduate and graduate students in meeting educational costs. The programs in clude scholarships, grants, loans and part-time employment, which may be awarded in various combinations and amounts to meet individual student needs. Because funds are limited in many programs, it is important to begin the application process early and complete the necessary applications properly and on time. To receive priority consideration for Supplemental Equal Opportunity Grant and all state grant funds, all necessary applications must be on file in the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by April 1 of each year. Most federal and state aid is awarded on the basis of proven financial need rather than academic achievement. Most scholarships ar e awarded on the basis of academic achievement, talents and special ski lls rather than proven financial need.

Student Loans UHD Going to Direct Lending. Based on recent developments in the lending industry and further antic ipated changes, UHD has made the decision to move to direct loans in order to make the process as easy as possible by eliminating further obstacles that may hamper students' attempts to borrow Stafford Loans. Beginning Fall 2010 all student loan borrows will accept Stafford Loan funds through Direct Lending. Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan. A low-interest loan with interest subsidies while student is enrolled at least half-time. Must be a US citizen or permanent resident and be enrolled at least halftime to participate.

Students may defer interest payments while enrolled at least half-time. Must be a US citizen or permanent resident and be enrolled at least half-time to participate. Maximum loan amounts vary with grade level in college. Additi onal application and loan counseling required. Application Procedures At a minimum, students should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Other forms or documentation may be required to determine eligibility for state and/or federal programs. 93When completing the FAFSA, students should list UH-Downtown's school code (003612) in Step Six. Once a student has begun the application process, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will notify the student of missing forms and/or documentation by mail. Students will also be mailed an award letter when their eligibility for aid has been finalized. Students may also access their financial aid information online at www.uhd.edu/eservices. Certain categories of foreign-born and immigrant students in the state of Texas can meet state requirements for residency. Such students are able to pay the resident tuition rate while attending public institutions of higher education in Texas. If a student falls into this category he/she will need to complete the Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA). The application is available online at www.uhd.edu/eservice/financialaid . Direct Lending Procedures for All Borrowers Effective Fall 2010 Getting Started: Important: You will need your Department of Education issued PIN (the same PIN used for the FAFSA) in order to complete and electronically sign your new electronic Master Promissory Note (eMPN) under the Direct Loan Program. If you have forgotten your PIN or do not yet have one, please go to www.pin.ed.gov to have your PIN sent to you. Have your social security number, date of birth, and driver's license number accessible. You will also be required to provide two personal references (full name, address, and telephone number) whom you have known for at least three years. Each reference provided must reside at a different U.S. address as well as different from the student's address. Complete a New Electronic Master Promissory Note (eMPN) To complete your eMPN, you will need to go to The Direct Loan eMPN website and click on \"Complete New MPN for Student Loans\". Remember that you will need your Department of Education issued PIN to begin the process. An eMPN can be completed in 9 steps. We estimate that it will take 30 minutes to complete the eMPN process. Make sure you allow enough time to complete the entire process in a single session. If you exit the web site before submitting your signed MPN in Step 8 and return later, you'll have to start over beginning with Step 1. Step 1 - PIN Registration Step 2 - Disclosure and Consent Step 3 - Provide Name and School Step 4 - Complete MPN Step 5 - Review/Read Draft MPN Step 6 - Sign Your MPN Step 7 - Review signed MPN/Enter Confirmation Code Step 8 - Confirm Acceptance of MPN Terms and Submit MPN Step 9 - Success! Now Print Your MPN Once you complete the eMPN process correctly, UHD will receive notification electronically that you have completed your MPN. This will allow the UHD Financial Aid Office to continue working on your loan disbursement process. Other Eligibility Requirements UHD Degree-Seeking Student Requirement To be eligible for financial aid, students must be admitted as a degree-seeking student at UH-Downtown. Transient students (students taking classes to transfer toward a degree pursued at another institution) are not eligible for financial aid at UHD. Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements In order to receive financial aid, students must make progress toward their degree as defined by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. There are three components to academic progress: Grade Point Requirement Undergraduate students must achieve and maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative grade point average on all course work attempted. Graduate students must achieve and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0. Completion Requirement Students must complete at least 73% of all course work attempted. Time Frame Requirement Students may attempt up to 170 hours without earning a degree. Students who have earned their first bachelor's degree are allowed 150% of the hours remaining to complete their program. A complete copy of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy is available upon request. Please read this policy to s ee how progress will be monitored. The Office of Scholarships and Financ ial Aid is required to review students' entire academic records (regardless of the age of the record or whether or not aid was received) to determine compliance. Students found not to be in compliance will be notified in writing of any denial/suspension and the appr opriate appeal procedure. Dropping Classes Students' final eligibility for aid will be based on the number of hours for which they are enrolled on the Official Day of Record listed in the Class Schedule . If they register and then drop classes prior to that date, their eligibility for aid will be RECALCULATED on the remaining hours as of the Official Day of Re cord. Since financial aid is released prior to the Official Day of Record, students who receive a financial aid payment based on more hours than t hose remaining as of the Official Day of Record may be responsible for repaying a portion of any financial aid received. Dropping classes may affect students' eligibility for future aid. Students should c onsult the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy to determine if dr opping classes will affect their eligibility for aid. Total Withdrawal from School For students who register and then tota lly withdraw from all classes, eligibility for aid will be RECALCUL ATED based on the number of days 94they attended class. If they totally withdraw from all classes prior to the first class day, they must repay any and all financial aid received. If they withdraw on or after the first class day, they may have to repay a portion of any cash financial aid received. Students who have failed to earn a passing grade in any of their classes are considered to have totally withdrawn from school and may have to repay a portion of any financial aid received. See Return of Title IV Funds below. Students who totally withdraw should consult the definition of Satisfactory Academic Progress to determine if their withdrawal will affect their eligibility for future aid. Return of Title IV Funds The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 changed the formula for calculating the amount of aid a student and school can retain when the student totally withdraws from all classes or fails to earn a passing grade in any of the current semester's classes. Students who withdraw from all classes prior to completing 60% of the semester will have their eligibility for aid recalculated based on the percent of the semester completed. For example, a student who withdraws completing only 30% of the term will have \"earned\" only 30% of any Title IV aid received. The remaining 70% must be returned by the school and/or the student. A student who fails to earn a passing grade in any of his/her courses will have their eligibility recalculated based on the midpoint of the semester or the last date of participation in an academically related activity. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid encourages you to obtain a complete copy of this policy from the office and read it carefully. If you are thinking about withdrawing from all classes PRIOR to completing 60% of the semester, you should contact the Office of Scholarship s and Financial Aid to see how your withdrawal will affect your financial aid. Academic Scholarships Academic scholarships at UH-Downtown are intended to recognize and reward outstanding achievement and community involvement. Applicants for most scholarships, therefore, do not need to show evidence of financial need to apply. The application deadline for most UH-Downtown scholarships is April 1 of each academic year. However, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid may accept applications at other times during t he year if scholarship funds are available. Interested students should c ontact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid as soon as they decide to apply for admission at UHD to find out what scholarships are available. Many academic departments at UHD also award scholarships. Students are encouraged to contact the department of their major to find out what departmental scholarships are available. Tuition and Fee Exemptions Hazlewood Act for Veterans State law provides that a veteran who is a legal Texas resident is exempted from tuition and certain r equired fees, but not from deposits, if the following criteria are met. The veteran: has resided in Texas for a period of not less than 12 months prior to the date of registration; served in the armed forces or in certain auxiliary services for more than 180 days; was a bona fide legal Texas resident at the time of entering such service; was honorably discharged (except those who were discharged because of being over the age of 38 or because of personal request); has exhausted all veteran's educational benefits; is not eligible for federal grants, including federally sponsored grants provided for veterans by the US government; and is not be in default on any federal or state student loans.

Contact the Office of the Scholarships and Fi nancial Aid for proper procedures. Academic Policies - Graduate Graduate Admission Procedure Admission to graduate programs is competitive, incorporating a consideration of multiple factors like GPA, standardized test scores, etc. Decisions for admission are made by department graduate committees. Usually deadlines for admission are set by each department. For information on deadlines, please visit www.uhd.edu/academic/gradprograms.htm. Applicants are notified about their st atus of application and admissions by mail. Appeals of admission deni als should be submitted to the appropriate Department Chair, and if necessary, to the College Dean. Courses and Course Credit Course Load A full-time graduate course load during the fall and spring terms is 9 semester credit hours or three courses. For students who are employed 40 hours per week, the recommended load is two courses, or six credit hours. Depending on the program, the regular load for one combined summer session (9 weeks) is 6-9 credit hours. Students who wish to enroll in more than the recommended course load must seek approval from the appropriate academic dean. For further information on graduate course load consult spec ific master's degree handbooks. Schedule Changes Schedule changes are made online, th rough telephone registration and in person and may require approval by an academic advisor. Instructions are found in each semester's Class Schedule. Discontinued Classes The university reserves the right to discontinue classes or otherwise 95alter the class schedule. Whenever possible, enrollment in an alternate course is completed through an administrative change form initiated by the department responsible for discontinuing the class. Classification Students admitted to a graduate program are classified as graduate students. Post-baccalaureate student s enrolled in graduate courses are governed by undergraduate policies. Class Attendance Each department or instructor has policies on class attendance. Regular presence in class is strongly encouraged. Transfer Credit Acceptance of Transfer Credit Students must submit official tr anscripts from all colleges or universities attended as a part of t he admission process. An evaluation will be performed upon acceptance into the university. Course work transferred or accepted for credit toward a graduate degree must represent collegiate course work rele vant to the degree, with course content and level of instruction resulting in student competencies at least equivalent to those of students enrolled in the institution's own graduate degree program. Six semester hours of graduate credit from another accredited insti-tution may be transferred into a degree plan, subject to approval from the graduate degree coordinator. After being admitted into a UH-Downtown graduate program, students should obtain approval from their degree-granting college before taking any courses, with intent to transfer. Students may take up to 9 graduate hours with post-baccalaureate status. However, these courses are evaluated by the department admitting the student, may not be accepted into the specific degree program, and may be limited to 6 hours. Transfer credit will not be granted for courses in which grades of C or lower have been earned. Students shoul d direct questions concerning transfer credit to their graduate coordinator. Evaluation of Transfer Credit Transcripts will be evaluated for institutional transfer credit upon admission to a UH-Downtown graduate program. Transferring Credits from Other Countries Students applying for admission with college credits from other countries must submit an evaluated transcript from a credential evaluation service recognized by t he university. Graduate coordinators will consider granting transfer credit based on the recommendations of the evaluating service. Informat ion and brochures from evaluating services are available at the Office of Admissions. Auditing Courses To audit a course is to enroll in a course on a noncredit basis. Students wishing to audit courses should c ontact the Registrar's Office. Students auditing courses pay regular tuition and all other applicable fees as set forth in this Catalog. A change to credit status may not be made after the student has registered to audit a course. Changes from credit status to audit status in a course must be made prior to the end of the Official Day of Record. Grading System and Standards All students are expected to maintain high academic standards throughout their graduate programs. In general, graduate students may not make any more than a certain number of grades of C. Please consult your graduate handbook for addi tional information. In addition, grades of D or F are grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. All graduate students at UHD are subject to the following policies as well as any policies stated in the handbooks for each degree program. Links to the graduate programs can be found at http://www.uhd.edu/academic/gradprograms.htm. Academic Honesty The Academic Honesty Code is embraced by all members of the University of Houston-Downtown academic community and is an essential element of the institution's academic credibility. The Honesty Code states \"We will be honest in a ll our academic activities and will not tolerate dishonesty.\" The purp ose of the Academic Honesty Policy is to deal with alleged violations of the Honesty Code in a fair and consistent manner. The policy is administered jointly by students and faculty. It is each student's responsibility to read and understand the Academic Honesty Policy. It may be found in the Student Handbook for each program. Grading System The following grades are included in the calculation of grade point averages: Grade* Grade Points A Superior ...................................................................................... 4.0 B Above Average........................................................................... 3.0 C Average ...................................................................................... 2.0 D Below Average ........................................................................... 1.0 F Failure ........................................................................................ 0.0 *Grade descriptions are subject to override by descriptions published in the handbooks for each graduate program. The following grades are not included in the calculation of grade point averages: Grade .Audit S ....................................................................... Satisfacto ry (passing) U ............................................................. Unsatisfactory (not passing) W .......................................................................................... Withdraw I (Incomplete) An incomplete grade is given only when an unforeseen emergency prevents a student from completing the course work and only with the instructor's approval. A grade of I will be changed to a passing grade if the missing work is completed satisfactorily by the deadline set by the 96instructor but no later than the end of the long semester immediately following the term in which the grade was received. An incomplete grade that is not removed by this deadline becomes an F. Repetition of a course for which an incomplete grade was received does not affect resolution of the original grade. An incomplete grade earned in a student's graduating semester is computed as an F in determining grade point average. IP (In Progress) A grade of IP may be given in thesis and capstone courses. In the calculation of grade point average, a grade of IP is treated as a W. To receive credit for a course in which an IP was assigned, a student must register for the course again and earn a passing grade. S (Satisfactory) The grade of S may be earned in thesis and certain other courses. Credit received with a grade of S is not part of the grade point average calculation. W (Withdrawal from Courses) Students will not receive a grade if they withdraw from a course by the Official Day of Record. Students automatically receive a grade of W for any course from which they withdraw after the Official Day of Record but before the end of Thursday of the 10th week during a long term and Thursday of the fourth week during a summer term. Official Day of Record and withdrawal deadlines are published in the University Calendar found in the Class Schedule. Class days are defined as days on which the university has one or more classes scheduled, not the days for which an individual student is scheduled for his/her particular classes. Additional policies applicable to graduate students are published in the specific master's degree handbooks. Grade Point Average (GPA) The grade point average is a measure of a student's academic achievement. Grade point averages ar e computed by multiplying the grade point value by the number of credit hours in each course, and then dividing the sum of all grade points obtained by the total number of hours attempted. The following formula represents the method of computing grade point average: Total Number of Grade Points Total Number of Semester Hours = Grade Point Average The number of grade points earned for each course equals the hour credit value of the course multiplied by the points awarded for grades received. Grades of I, S, U, IP and grades marked with an asterisk (*) in the table above are not counted in the calculation of the grade point average, except for graduation. Gr ades of I will be calculated as F grades in determining grade point average for graduation. Graduate students must meet a graduation requirement of a minimum 3.0 grade point average. Appeal of Grades Any grade which a student believes to be in error should be appealed, first to the instructor, then to the appropriate department chair, and finally to the appropriate dean. If an appeal is not made within one calendar year after the close of the semester in which the grade was received, the grade will be considered final and no appeal will be heard. Repeated Course Policy The policies applicable to graduate students covering repeated courses are published in the specific degree program handbooks. Academic Probation and Suspension In general, grades of D and F are grounds for suspension from the graduate program. Students whose GPA falls below 3.0 will be placed on academic probation and must continue to obtain a semester GPA of 3.0 or above while on probation. Failure to do so will result in suspension. Please note that policies applicable to graduate students covering academic probation and su spension are published in the specific degree program handbooks. Student Records Transcripts Requests for official UHD transcripts are made to the Registrar's Office. Requests for UHD transcripts may be made online through Student e-Services, by fax, or by ma il.

One semester credit hour is normally equivalent to one hour of class work, or from one to six hours of laboratory work per week for a semester. All courses are identified by discipl ine and number. The first digit of a course number indicates the academic level. Courses in the 1000 series are generally for freshmen, 2000 for sophomores, 3000 for juniors and 4000 for seniors. The 5000 and 6000 series courses are graduate courses. Undergraduates are not allowed to enroll in graduate courses without permission of the academic department which offers the courses. The se cond digit indicates the number of semester credit hours that the course carries. The third and fourth digits specify a particular c ourse within its discipline. The three numbers in parentheses afte r each course title indicate the number of semester credit hours, t he number of class hours per week, and the number of additional laborator y or activity hours per week. Texas Common Course Numbering System The University of Houston-Downtown is a participant in the Texas Common Course Numbering System (TCCNS). This system ensures that if a student takes a course bearing a common course number at another college or university, UH-Downtown will accept the course in transfer as equivalent to the corresponding UH-Downtown course. Common course numbers have a four-letter prefix followed by a four-digit number. The four-letter prefix identifies the subject area. For example, ENGL is the common prefix for English courses, and COSC is the common prefix for computer science courses. The four-digit number following the prefix identifies a specific course with the subject area. Each digit in the four-digit sequenc e gives additional information about the course. The first digit identifies t he course as either freshman level (1) or sophomore level (2). The second digit identifies the number of credit hours students earn upon completing the course. The final two digits indicate the sequence in wh ich courses are generally taken. Thus, French I (FREN 1311) is taken before French II (FREN 1312).
