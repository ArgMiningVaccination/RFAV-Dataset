It is not i ntended to provide medical or legal advice. 1. What publicly funded i nfluenza vaccines are available for i ndividuals 65 years of age for Ontario's 202 3/2024 Universal Influenza Immunization Program (UIIP)? The publicly funded influenza vaccines available for individuals 65 years of age and older include: 1. Quadrivalent Inactivated Vaccine (QIV) for 6 months of age 2. High -Dose Quadrivalent Inactivated Vaccine (QIV -HD) for Adjuvanted Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine (TIV -adj) for 65 Inactivated Vaccines Sanofi Vaccine Egg-based Egg-based Micrograms of hemagglutinin 15 \u00b5g 15 \u00b5g mL 0.5 mL Format MDV MDV and PFS Route IM IM Pasteur Seqirus Vaccine Egg-based Egg-based Micrograms of hemagglutinin 60 \u00b5g 15 \u00b5g Dosage 0.7 mL 0.5 mL Adjuvant No Yes Format PFS PFS Route IM IM Most common syringe IM = Intramuscular injection NACI = National Advisory Committee on Immunization 1 Any component in a vaccine may be a potential allergen. This table identifies the most common allergens. 2 The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) indicates that egg allergy is not a contraindication for influenza vaccination and that that egg -allergic individuals may be vaccinated against influenza using the full dose of any age - appropriate product. See section IV of the Canadian Immunization Guide chapter on Influenza and statement on seasonal influenza vaccine fo r 2018 -2019 for studies supporting the NACI recommendation for egg -allergic individuals ( www.phac- aspc.gc.ca/naci -ccni/#rec). Fluzone\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent different produ cts. Please use caution when administering Fluzone\u00ae products to ensure that the right vaccine is being administered to the right person.2023-09 -11 3 2.What i s QIV-HD and how is it different than the QIV? The QIV-HD and QIV both contain four influenza strains ( A(H3N2 ), A(H1N1) and two B strain s), however, QIV -HD contains a higher amount of antigen per strain than standard -dose influenza vaccine formulations. The Q IV-HD contains 60 g of hemagglutinin (HA) protein for each of the four vaccine strains, compared to 15 g of HA per strain in a standard dose QIV . Studies have shown that the higher antigen content in the high- dose vaccine improves the immune response and prevention of influenza hospitalizations compared to standard dose vaccine , which is important since older individuals may not respond as well to influenza vaccine s compared to younger individuals. More details on the specific strains included in this season's influenza vaccines are outlined in the Health Care Provider Qs & As: Information for the 202 3/202 4 document. influenza vaccine that is licen sed for persons 65 years of age and over. The adjuvant is designed to improve the immune response to the vaccine, which is important since older individuals may not have as strong an immune respon se to influenza vaccine as younger individuals. The adjuvanted vaccine is a trivalent vaccine, meaning it is designed to protect against three influenza viruses: two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus. 4.What is an adjuvant? An adjuvant is a substance added to a vaccine that helps the recipient develop an improved immune response compared to receiving an unadjuvanted vaccine. The adjuvant in Fluad\u00ae is an oil -in-water mixture called MF59. 5.Which influenza vaccine should individuals 65 years of age receive? The QIV, QIV- HD and TIV -adj ALL protect against the flu, and the most important thing is for older adults to be vaccinated. DO NOT DELAY VACCINATION TO WAIT FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT . 2023-09 -11 4 For individual -level decision making, NACI states that when available, high -dose should be used over standard -dose inactivated influenza vaccine , given the burden of influenza A(H3N2) disease and the good evidence of better protection compared to standard -dose in adults 65 years of age and older. However, NACI states that in the absence of a specific product , any of the available age appropriate influenza vaccines should be used. T here is NO PREFERENTIAL RECOMMENDATION for the use of QIV- HD versus TIV- adj vaccine for this age group. To date, no s tudies have directly compared QIV -HD and TIV -adj formulations or TIV - adj and QIV formulations. The following information should be considered when discussing vaccine options: There is insufficient evidence to make a preferential recommendation between QIV -HD and TIV -adj.There is good evidence of QIV -HD providing better protection compared to QIV standard dose . In considering use of TIV- adj and QIV standard dose, given the increased burden of disease associated with influenza A(H3N 2) in older adults, better protection against influenza A(H3N2) afforded by the TIV- adj may be more important , especially in those with multiple co -morbid conditions and compromised health status . For more information on the vaccines available for individ uals 65 years of age and older , please refer to the following: Canadian Immunization Guide Chapter on Influenza and Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2023-2024 available doses of the i nfluenza vaccine are needed to provide protection? One dose of the influenza vaccine i s needed each year to provide protection each influenza season. 7.Who can administer the influenza vaccine? Individuals who can administer the influenza vaccine include: Regulated health professionals who are authorized under the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991 to administer vaccines. oNote: trained pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, pharmacy students and interns may only administer p ublicly funded influenza vaccine to individuals 2 years of age and older. Trained individuals under a delegation made in accordance with the requirements set by the regulatory College of the regulated health professional. 8.Can these vaccine cause influenza? No. The publicly funded standard dose QIV, Q IV-HD and TIV -adj are all inactivated vaccines so individuals cannot get influenza from the vaccine. 9.Do any of the publicly funded influenza vaccines offer protection against COVID-19 or other diseases? The influenza vaccine will not protect against respiratory viruses o ther than influenza , including the coronavirus that causes COVID -19, but will help prevent infection and illness from the influenza virus . Protection against infection and illness from the influenza virus through influenza vac cination may provide added benefit in protecting against other diseases such as invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease (iGAS) or worsening of existing chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease. 2023-09 -11 6 10. Will the influenza vaccine increase risk of infection or severe outcomes related to COVID -19? No. Expert groups and evidence indicate that getting the influenza vaccine will not increase your risk of COVID -19 infection or severe outcomes related to COVID -19. 11. Can the influenza vaccine be given at the same time as other vaccines? Vaccine Intervals (if applicable) COVID -19 and other vaccines The influenza vaccines for 65 + (i.e., QIV- HD, TIV -adj, and QIV) may be given at the same time with other vaccines, or at any time before or after other vaccines, including COVID -19 vaccine . There are no direct studies on the co -administration of Shingrix\u00ae HD) - see Shingrix\u00ae section below. If given by injection at the same time, separate limbs should be used if possible. Alternatively, the injections may be administered into the same muscle separated by at least 2.5 cm (1\"). Different immunization equipment (needle and syri nge) must be used for each vaccine. Shingrix\u00ae No studies have been conducted that have assessed the co - administration of Shingrix\u00ae with adjuvanted or high -dose influenza vaccines. With Fluad\u00ae, it is unknown how the adjuvants may interact when Shingrix\u00ae is co -administered. 12. Can the vaccine be given to individuals when they are ill? It is d epend ent o n the severity of the symptoms. Those with a severe acute illness with or without fever should wait until the symptoms subside before being immunized . Individuals with symptoms of acute illness, including minor symptoms such as sore throat, should be recommended to complete the COVID- 19 Self - Assessment Tool (available at: covid -19.ontario.ca/self -assessment ). If the individual screens negative using the Self -Assessment Tool, influenza immunization may be provided. 2023-09 -11 7 13. What are the common side effects from the influenza vaccine? The most common side effects from the influenza vaccine are: Redness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site Headache Tiredness/weakness Fever These side effects are generally mild and last only a few days. 14. Who should NOT get the influenza vaccine? Anyone who has had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of influenza vaccine or to any ingredient in the vaccine, except for egg , should NOT be vaccinated . According to NACI, egg- allergic individuals may be vaccinated against influenza using the full dose of any age -appropriate product, including QIV, QIV- HD and TIV -adj. Anyone who has develop ed Guilla in-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) within six weeks of a previous influenza vaccination should generally NOT be vaccinated, HOWEVER , this should be weighed against the risks of not being protected against influenza . 15. How long should the observation period be following influenza immunization? NACI recommends a 15- mi nute post -vaccination observation period, as specified in the Canadian Immunization Guide (CIG). If there is a specific concern about possible vaccine allergy, 30 minutes is a safer interval. The link to the CIG consideration for a reduced post -vaccination observation period , between 5 to 15 minutes for the administration of influenza vaccine during the pandemic, at times when appropriate physical distancing in post -vaccination waiting areas could not otherwise be maintained due to the volume of individuals seeking immun ization and only when specific conditions were met: 2023-09 -11 8 Past history of receipt of influenza vaccine and no known history of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) to any component of the influenza vaccine being considered for administration. No h istory of other immediate post- vaccination reactions (e.g., syncope with or without seizure) after receipt of any vaccines. The vaccine recipient is accompanied by a responsible adult who will act as a chaperone to monitor the vaccine recipient for a mini mum of 15 minutes post - vaccination. In the case of two responsible adults, both can be vaccinerecipients for the purposes of this criterion, if both agree to monitor the otherpost -vaccination. The vaccine recipient will not be operating a motorized vehi cle or self - propelled or motorized wheeled transportation or machinery for a minimum of 15 minutes after vaccination. The vaccine recipient and the responsible adult chaperone are aware of when and how to seek post -vaccination advice and given instruction on what to do if assistance and medical services are required. The vaccine recipient and the responsible adult agree to remain in the post - vaccination waiting area for the post- vaccination observation period and to notify staff if the recipient feels or looks at all unwell before leaving. Theyshould be informed that an individual exhibiting any symptom suggestive ofan evolving adverse event following immunization (AEFI) at the end of theshortened post -observation period necessitates a longer period of observation in the clinic. The link to the NACI guidance on reduced observation period is available at: What i nformation should be provided to individuals related to potential adverse event s following i mmunization (AEFI) with the i nfluenza vaccine? The influenza vaccine, like any medicine, may cause adverse events, which i n most cases are mild, lasting only a few days. Life -threatening allergic (anaphylactic) reactions are very rare. If they do occur, it is typically within a few minutes to a few hours after receiving the vaccine. Some studies have found a possible small association between injectable infliuenza vaccine and Guilla in-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) and others have not found any association. Oculorespiratory Syndrome (ORS) may occur in extremely rare instances. Please refer to question 21 of th e Health Care2023-09 -11 9 Prov ider Q & A: I nformation for the 20 23/202 4 Influenza Season sheet for further details. As per the s.38 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act , those administering vaccines should ensure that the vaccine recipients are aware of the need to immediately report adverse events following immunization to their health care provider. Vaccine recipients should be advised to go to the nearest emergency department if severe reactions develop, including the following: Hives Swelling of the mouth or throat Trouble br eathing, hoarseness or wheezing High fever (over 40\u00b0C or 104\u00b0F) Convulsions (seizures) Other serious reactions Health care providers ( e.g., physicians, nurses and pharmacists) are required by law (i.e., Health Protection and Promotion Act, s. 38) to report AEFIs to their local public health unit. Reports should be made using the Ontario AEFI Reporting Form (available at: www.publichealthontario.ca/vaccinesafety ) and sent to the local public hea lth unit .
