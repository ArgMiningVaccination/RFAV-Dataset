It is located above and behind the pubic b one. The position varies during empty and full bladder condition s and is also dependent on the condition of the rectum. The urinary bladder is composed of four surfaces: the superior, posterior, and two inferolateral surfaces. The superior surface is tria ngular, covered by peritoneum and slightly arched i n the empty state . The posterior surf ace is covered by peritoneum in its superior region and the inferior region is covered by the endopelvic fascia of the rectovesical septum. The downward directed infero lateral surfaces point at the apex and are fully covered by endopelvic fascia (Fig. 16). Additionally , the bladder includes the apex, fundus, neck, and body (between apex and fundus). The apex is directed toward the upper margin of the symphysis and is connected to the umbilicus by the median umbilical ligament. The fundus is the inferior region of the posterior wall and includes the trigone, which is firmly connected to the muscular coat. The trigone is always smooth even when the bladder is empty and i s delineated by the two orifices of the ureters and the bladder neck, which is the most inferior region and connects the urethra to the urinary bladder ( Fig. 17 ) [87,88 ]. The bladder wall is composed of ucosa, represents the innermost layer and contains the urothelium, which lines the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder and a portion of the urethra. It consists of a basal cell layer (attached to the basement membrane), an in termediate layer and a superficial layer. The latter contains umbrella , cells inclu ding uroplakins, which act as a barrier by reducing the permeability of the urothelium. Tight junctions , as well as the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer, which covers the umbre lla cells, are assumed to contribute Figure 16. Lateral view of the urinary bladder [85]. Figure 17. Urinary bl adder anatomy: The M 2 and M 4 receptors initiate an additional pathway. The se receptors bind to pertussis toxin -sensitive G i/o. and inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC), inhibit ing the cyclic AMP -induced relaxation [ 91]. In the urothelium, M 2 receptors are only expressed in the umbrella cells , whereas the M3, M 4, and M 5 receptors are expressed throughout the urothelium and detrusor muscle cells . The activation of the urothelial muscarinic receptors by an agonist induces the release of ATP and t he production of NO [ 96]. Figure 19. Detrusor muscle contraction induced by the activation of M 3 muscarinic receptor signal ling. ACh, acetylcholine ; -induced calcium release . The a ctivation of M 3 receptor by ACh induces Ca2+ influx via L - type Ca2+ channels and calcium release from the SR. The Rock pathway and MLCK -dependent pathway are briefly il lustrated.

Karin F\u00fcre r Introduction ! plant native to Madagas- car and belongs to the family of Crassulaceae. It is commonly known as life plant, air plant, love plant, and Goethe plant. B. pinnatum has been widely used in traditional medicine, especially in Madagascar, Indonesia, India, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago where the leaves have been utilized to treat jaundice [1], skin diseases, urinary prob- lems, hypertension, and for its cooling properties in topical use [2 -4]. In 1921, B. pinnatum preparations were estab- lished Rudolf Steiner as anthroposophical medicines to treat hysteria [5]. Later, B. pinnatumwas also used in obstetrics and gynaecology as a tocolytic agent to prevent premature labour [6] and, more recently, to treat sleep disorders in pregnancy. As a tocolytic agent B. pinnatum showed only mild and few adverse effects and was very well tolerated [7]. We could show that the leaf juice inhibits an oxytocin-induced in- crease of intracellular calcium concentration in human myometrial cells [8] and induces myome- trial relaxation in vitro [9]. Recently, we reported that B. pinnatum leaf press juice also inhibits por- cine detrusor contractility in vitro [10]. To explore the potential of B. pinnatum as a treatment for pa- tients suffering from overactive bladder syn- drome, a pilot study in humans was performed. A positive trend for a B. pinnatum preparation com- pared to placebo could be shown [11].Abstract ! Bryophyllum pinnatum is a succulent perennial plant native to Madagascar which is used in anthroposophical medicine to treat psychiatric disorders and as a tocolytic agent to prevent pre- mature labour. We performed a metabolite profil- ing study in order to obtain a comprehensive pic- ture of the constituents in B. pinnatum leaves and to identify chromatographic markers for quality control and safety assessment of medicinal prepa- rations. Preliminary HPLC /uni2011PDA-ESIMS analyses revealed that flavonoid glycosides were the main UV-absorbing constituents in the MeOH extract ofB. pinnatum .T w op h e n o l i cg l u c o s i d e s ,s y r i n g i c acid -D-glucopyranosyl as nine flavonoids ( 3-11)i n c l u d i n gk a e m p f e r o l quercetin, 2D NMR analysis after isolation r i c e t i n3 - O - -L-arabinopyranosyl-(1 2)--L-rhamnopyran- oside ( 4)w e r en e wn a t u r a lp r o d u c t s .W i t ht h ea i d of HPLC /uni2011PDA-APCIMS and authentic references isolated from the related species B. daigremontia- num ,t h ep r e s e n c eo ff o u rb u f a d i e n o l i d e s ,b e r s a l - degenin-1-acetate ( 12), bryophyllin ( 15)w a sd e t e c t e di n B. pinnatum information available online at http://www.thieme-connect.de/ejournals/toc/ Flavonol Glycosides and a Metabolite Profile ofBryophyllum pinnatum ,aP h y t o t h e r a p e u t i cU s e di n Obstetrics and Gynaecology Authors Karin F\u00fcrer1,2,M e l a n i eR a i t h1,R u d o l fB r e n n e i s e n3,M o n i c aM e n n e t4,A n aP a u l aS i m \u00f5 e s - W \u00fc s t5,U r s u l av o nM a n d a c h2, Matthias Hamburger1,O l i v i e rP o t t e r a t1 Affiliations The affiliations are listed at the end of articleKey February 28, 2013 revised June 11, 2013 accepted August 11, 2013 Bibliography DOI http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0033-1350808 Published online September /uni20110943 Correspondence PD Dr. Olivier Potterat Division of Pharmaceutical Biology Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences University of Basel Klingelbergstra\u00dfe 50 4056 Basel Switzerland Phone: + 41612671534 Fax: + [18] have been reported. the plant include flavonoids, triterpenes, phytosterols, bufadieno- lides, fatty acids, and minerals [19]. flavonoid fraction was found to consist mainly of kaempferol and quercetin glycosides, some of which have shown in vitro antileishmanial activity [12, 20]. A series of bufadienolides such as bryophyllins A -C, and ber- saldegenin derivatives have been isolated [19,21]. These com- pounds reportedly possess sedative and positive inotropic prop- erties, as well as CNS-related activities [22]. For safety assessment and quality control of phytomedicines containing B. pinnatum , detailed information on their metabolite profile is required. There have been only a few relevant analytical studies on B. pin- natum .F o u rf l a v o n o i d sw e r ea s s i g n e di nt h eH P L C /uni2011UV/uni2011MS chro- matogram of an aqueous extract [23]. A series of flavonoids were also identified by HPLC /uni2011UV in a chromatographic fraction [24]. No study includes, however, a comprehensive analysis of the con- stituents of the plant. We therefore conducted a metabolite profiling of the MeOH extract in order to identify useful chroma- tographic markers for quality control and safety assessment, whereby special emphasis was put on flavonoids and bufadieno- lides. Results and Discussion ! To obtain a comprehensive metabolite profile, leaves of B. pinna- tum were extracted with MeOH, and the extract was submitted to HPLC /uni2011PDA-ESIMS analysis ( l\"Fig. 1 ). The UV trace and PDA spectra revealed the presence of several peaks of UV-absorbing phenolic compounds. In addition, a group of large peaks eluting between 19 and 24 min were detected in the MS trace. By com- parison with reference compounds previously isolated by the au- thors from Lycium barbarum (unpublished results), two peaks In addition, a peak at tR20.4 min ( m/z518.6) was tentatively assigned to -linolenoyl lysophosphatidylcholine.

Two flavonol glycosides were new natural products. Most peaks detected by HPLC /uni2011PDA-ESIMS could be structurally assigned. In addition, bu- fadienolides could be unambiguously detected by HPLC-APCIMS. In agreement with previous reports, flavonoids are the main UV- active constituents of the MeOH leaf extract. The major peak was found to be quercetin 3-O- -L-arabinopyranosyl-(1 2)--L- rhamnopyranoside ( 6), confirming a of its occur- rence as the main flavonoid in an aqueous extract [23]. The flavo- noids identified are suited as chemical markers for quality con- trol of medicinal preparations, whereas the bufadienolides are important for safety assessment regarding the presence or ab- sence of potentially toxic constituents in specific products.

Anti-cholinergic drugs show a poor compliance due to side effects. There is an increasing use of plant extractsin medicine. We have therefore investigated the inhibitory effects of leaf press juice from Bryophyllumpinnatum (Lam.) Oken (Kalanchoe pinnata L.) on bladder strips and compared the effects to that ofoxybutynin.Methods:Strips of porcine detrusor were prepared in Krebs solution and contractility was measured in amyograph system chamber aired with O2/CO2at 37C. To induce contractions, electrical eld stimulation(32 Hz, 40 V) was used for the inhibitory effect measurements, and carbachol (50/H9262M) for the relaxanteffect measurements. Recordings were obtained in the absence and presence of increasing concentrationsof Bryophyllum pinnatum leaf press referencesubstance.Results:In inhibition experiments, oxybutynin inhibited electrically induced contractions ofporcine detrusor. BPJ at concentrations of 5% inhibited the contraction compared to a time matched con-trol signicantly by 74.6\u00b110.2% strips. The maximum relaxant effect of BPJ compared to a time matched control was18.7\u00b13.7 (p< 0.05) at a concentration of 10% BPJ.Conclusions:Our investigations show that BPJ inhibits contractions induced by electrical eld stimulationand relaxes carbachol-induced contractions. However, the effect was lower than that of the referencesubstance oxybutynin. It is important to continuein vitroexperiments as well as clinical studies with BPJthat might offer a new treatment option for patients with OAB.\u00a9 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.IntroductionLower urinary tract dysfunction causing urgency with or with-out urge incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency andnocturia,was dened by the International Continence Society (ICS)in 2002 as the overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome (Abrams et al.Correspondingauthor at: Department of Obstetrics, Research Perinatal Phar-macology, University Hospital Path G 51 a, Schmelzbergstrasse 10, CH-8091 Zurich,Switzerland.E-mailaddress:ursula.vonmandach@bluewin.ch(U. von Mandach).2002). This new term, which replaces older terms such as unstablebladder/detrusorinstability and detrusor hyperreflexia, is a symp-tomatic diagnosis. The fundamental cause of OAB remains to bediscoveredand there is some evidence that myogenic (Brading1997),aberrantneurogenicactivity(DeGroat 1997) and cerebralalterations (Grifths et al. 2005) as well as atypical or latent bladderinfections(Kavia et al. 2005) are involved in its pathogenesis. Invol-untarydetrusor contractions that are of clinical importance anddemonstrable during urodynamic ll cystometry can be simulatedinanin vitromodel of bladder muscle strips.OAB syndrome affects a considerable part of the population:Prevalenceof OAB is at least as high as the rates of many other0944-7113/$ - see front matter\u00a9 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Schuler et al. / Phytomedicine 19 (2012) 947- 951chronic diseases, including asthma, coronary-artery disease andpeptic-ulcer disease (Chapple et al. 2008). Depending on thedenition for OAB which were used in different epidemiologicstudies, prevalence values range from 11.8% (Irwin et al. 2006) to16.6% (Milsom et al. 2001). Only Irwin et al. based their multina-tional, population based, cross-sectional survey on the current ICSdenitions. All of the mentioned studies found similar prevalencerates of OAB in men and women, and an increase in prevalencewith older age.OAB affects many aspects of daily life, like domestic behaviour,social interactions, sexuality, work life, physical activities and over-all psychological well-being. Nevertheless, Milsom et al. revealedthat only a small proportion of affected individuals currentlyreceive treatment: Only 60% of the interviewed individuals hadspoken to a doctor about their disorders, and among these, 73%remained without medication.The management of OAB includes a broad spectrum of treat-ments, such as behaviour modication, pharmacotherapy, pelvicfloor muscle darifenacin, trospium chloride the drug classto demonstrate a positive benet-to-risk ratio. Anticholinergicsremain the rst line treatment for OAB (Andersson 2011). How-ever, the lack of selectivity of antimuscarinics to the muscarinergicreceptors of the bladder muscle and urothelial cells leads to sys-temic anticholinergic side effects, such as dry mouth, tachycardia,cognitive problems, constipation and accommodation paralysis(i.e., blurred vision). These side effects limit the clinical use of thisdrug class, especially in the elderly (Andersson 2011). Long-termcompliance in an observational study was low, with less than 20% ofsubjects continuing the medication after 6 months (Kelleher et al.1997). In a recent prospective tolerability and efcacy study, thecompliance of the participants was much higher with 61% after 12weeks (Herschorn et al. 2010).For these reasons, interest in novel drug development for amore effective and well-tolerated treatment of OAB has increasedin recent years. As OAB is a multilevel disease involving bladder,neuronal and cerebral aspects, a new drug is expected to modulateall levels in a favourable manner.Complementary medicine systems like phytotherapy or anthro-posophic medicine are appreciated by a growing number ofpatients and physicians, due to good tolerability and efcacy in var-ious diseases. Phytomedicines are quite popular in some Europeancountries where they may be prescribed by medical doctor, andfully or partially reimbursed by the health care system.Bryophyllum pinnatum (Lam.) Oken (B. pinnatum, Crassulaceae)is a perennial plant originating from Madagascar. The plant is grow-ing widely in tropical Africa, tropical America, India, China andAustralia, and is known by a multitude of synonyms and commonnames like Kalanchoe pinnata Lam., B. calycinum Salisb., life plant,air plant, love plant, Canterbury bells, Cathedral bells, etc. Its uses infolk medicine have been as diverse as its names and included appli-cations as an antimicrobial, Saluja 2009). In Europe, theuse of remedies prepared from the species B. pinnatum is limitedalmost exclusively to anthroposophic medicine where it was intro-duced by Rudolf Steiner in 1921 for treatment of \"hystery\" (Hamreet al. 2006). Since 1970, B. pinnatum is used in anthroposophicallyoriented hospitals as routine treatment of preterm labour (Planggeret al. 2006).Some phytochemical studies from B. pinnatum have been con-ducted which led to the (Muzitano et al. 2006) fromB. pinnatum. However, no pharmacological studies with extractsnor isolated compounds have been conducted prior to our investi-gations (W\u00e4chter et al. 2011).An in vitro study showed that B. pinnatum reduced the con-tractility of myometrium muscle strips in both spontaneous andstimulated contractions (Gwehenberger et al. 2004). We recentlydemonstrated a relaxant effect of B. pinnatum leaf press juice(BPJ) and some chromatographic fractions on myometrium strips(Gwehenberger et al. 2004).Encouraged by these ndings, we tested the effect of BPJ ondetrusor contractility in in vitro porcine bladder methodsPlant materialB. pinnatum A number ZSS 29717 is deposited at the Zurich SucculentPlant Collection, Switzerland. The plants (leaves) were harvestedin Brazil (03/15/2010) by Mr. Moaci Copani, Weleda Brazil, in themorning before flowering. Thereafter the fresh plant material wasplaced in a refrigerated box and immediately sent by airplane toWeleda Arlesheim, Switzerland. The plants were kept refrigeratedand processed within 3 days of arrival by mechanical pressing ina roller mill to obtain BPJ (Weleda 03/23/2010). The procedurecorresponded to the production process for ingredientof Weleda. Bryophyllum 50% tablets (Weleda AG, Arlesheim). Thejuice was of and solutionsCarbamyolinecholine Darmstadt, H2O (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

The solution was adjusted to a pH 7.4 and storedat 4C. Ecotainer\u00aeAqua (B. Braun, Sempach, Switzerland) was usedas the solvent for all solutions.Porcine urinary bladderDue to similar density and pharmacological characteristics ofthe muscarinic receptors in porcine and human bladder tissue(Sellers and McKay 2007), the consistency of electrical properties ofdetrusor smooth muscle from the porcine and human urinary blad-der (Hashitani and Brading 2003), and good accessibility of decided to carry out slaughterhouse where they were immediatelyimmersed in cool Krebs solution for the transport. The mucosal lay-ers were removed, and detrusor strips (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5 mm) were cut ina longitudinal direction from the bladder wall. Isometric tensionrecordings were performed within 7 h.!!#V. Schuler et al. / Phytomedicine 19 (2012) 947- 951949Functional experimentsPorcine detrusor strips were mounted in a 6 tissue bathchamber (610M, Muscle Strip and digitized using AD Instruments model 4/30 in connection with LabChartPro 7.0 software(ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia). An initial equilibration periodof 0.5 g for a minimum of 30 min was allowed before starting theexperiments.Inhibitory effect measurements: Electrical eld stimulation(EFS) was applied through a Grass S48 electrical stimulator (Astro-Med inc., W. Warwick, RI, USA) and two electrodes placed on eachside of the strips. Contractions were induced by squared twin pulsesof 40 V, 32 Hz, with a duration of 2 ms, given for 5 s with an inter-val of 3 min. The rst stimulation after the equilibration periodwas performed to get the maximum amplitude of the contraction;thereby the mean of 3 similar peaks was used. Subsequently BPJ(0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10%) was added cumulatively followed by elec-trical stimulation after each BPJ application. The incubation timefor each BPJ concentration was 5 min and the next higher concen-tration was added after three similar amplitudes. One strip per runwithout addition of any substance was used as control. Oxybutynin(105to 103M) was used as a reference substance.Relaxant effect measurements: The strips were stimulated with50 /H9262M carbachol to obtain a constant level of tension. Then BPJwas added with cumulative concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and10%). In the following washout phase, Krebs solution was changed4 times until the strips achieved baseline tension. Carbachol 50 /H9262Mwas added again to check the contractility of the strips after thetreatment with BPJ. Oxybutynin (107to 105M) was used as areference substance. One strip of every run was used as a time-matched control without addition of any substance.Data analysis and statisticsIn the EFS inhibition experiments, the mean of 3 amplitudesbefore addition of BPJ or oxybutynin was dened as 100% Values after addition of BPJ, oxybutynin or the control,respectively, were expressed as the percentage of the 100% value;for each concentration the mean of 3 amplitudes was used. Inrelaxation experiments, the difference between the mean of ampli-tudes before the addition of carbachol (=baseline) and the meanimmediately after the addition of carbachol was dened as 100%contraction. The relaxant effect after addition of each concentra-tion of BPJ or oxybutynin was expressed as a percentage of the 100%value.

Herbal drugs are generally con-sidered to be as effective as synthetic products. The identicationof a nature-derived drug with a good activity and tolerability wouldbe a relief for both patients suffering from OAB and their attendingphysician.B. pinnatum is widely used in traditional medicine in differentparts of the world (Kamboj and Saluja 2009). Its muscle relaxantactivity to human myometrium in vitro and in vivo has been shownbefore (Plangger et al. 2006; W\u00e4chter et al. 2011; Gwehenbergeret al. 2004). Therefore, we investigated the inhibitory and relaxanteffect of BPJ on the contractions of isolated porcine detrusor musclestrips induced by electrical and chemical stimulation.This experiment shows that BPJ in concentrations of 1-10% leadsto an inhibition of electrically induced contractions. The inhibitionwas more pronounced for oxybutynin than for BPJ at all concentra-tions investigated (0.01-1 /H9262M vs. 1-10%, respectively). However, itis difcult to compare the results of a press juice with a chemicallydened substance since the compounds responsible for the activityof BPJ and their concentration are not completely characterisedyet. Both substances led to a concentration-dependent relaxationof carbachol-induced the inhibitory detrusor muscle was more distin-guished than the relaxant. One reason for the divergent resultsin these two experiments could be that the signalling pathwaysleading to contraction and relaxation of the detrusor smoothmuscle differ. The stimulation of muscarinic receptors on thedetrusor by acetylcholine, which is physiologically released fromactivated cholinergic nerves, is the main mechanism of bladdercontraction (Chapple et al. 2008). This stimulation is known tobe competitively inhibited by oxybutynin, our comparative studydrug for relaxation and inhibition measurements. The M3-receptorsubtype predominantly mediates bladder contraction despite thelarge majority of the M2-receptor subtype expressed in the bladdermucosa (Chapple et al. 2008). The role of the M2-receptor subtype!!$950V. Schuler et al. / Phytomedicine 19 (2012) 947- 951 Fig. 1. Inhibitory effect of B. pinnatum leaf press juice (A) and oxybutynin (B), respectively, on electrically induced contractions of porcine detrusor muscle. 100% of thecontraction was dened as mean of the 3 amplitudes before addition of the drug in increasing concentrations.

The M2-receptor may play an indirect rolein mediating bladder contractions by enhancing the contractileresponse to M3-activation (Chapple 2000). However, an explana-tion for our results is that the strong inhibitory effect of BPJ may betriggered by the inhibition of M3-receptors, whereas the relaxanteffect is mediated by the stimulation of the M2-receptor subtype.Since the expression of muscarinic receptors and the electricalproperties of detrusor smooth muscle from the porcine andhuman urinary bladder are very similar (Sellers and McKay 2007),B. pinnatum may have a comparable effect on human detrusor.Oxybutynin was shown to effectively block carbachol-inducedcontractions in numerous investigations. Its afnity for M1- andM3-receptors exceeds that of M2-subtypes (Andersson 2011).Besides cholinergic control of detrusor contractions, other mecha-nisms of actions have been discussed. They include, among others,the inhibition of the influx of extracellular calcium L-type Ca2+-channel blockers openers(Sacco favourable side effect prole of BPJin previous studies (Plangger et al. 2006), a muscarinic indepen-dent or balanced pathway might be suggested. Since BPJ containsa multitude of different compounds which are poorly studied,we cannot conclude on their potential afnity to muscarinic oradrenergic receptors, Ca2+or K+channels or other targets. showed that B. pinnatum inhibits the oxytocin-inducedincrease of intracellular calcium concentration in human myome-trial cells in a dose-dependent, but extracellular Ca2+-independent,manner. At the same time B. pinnatum delays (but not fully pre-vents) the depolarization-induced increase in Ca2+incells known to express L-type Ca2+-channels (Sim\u00f5es-W\u00fcst et al.2010). Whether a comparable delay can explain the now observedinhibitory effect on the contraction of detrusor smooth muscle cellsdeserves further investigation. In addition, radioligand displacingstudies would possibly offer a suitable method to investigate thereceptor - or ion channel-binding properties of BPJ constituents indetrusor smooth muscle cells.Furthermore, we recently showed that a flavonoid-containingfraction from BPJ was pharmacologically active and produced relax-ation of the myometrium (Gwehenberger et al. 2004).Other plants have been previously investigated for their in vitroinhibitory properties on detrusor contractility, such as Ylang Ylang(Cananga et al. 2003), St. John's Wort (Hypericumperforatum) (Capasso et al. 2004), European gold rod (Solidagovirgaurea) (Borchert et al. 2004) and sweet sumach bark (Rhus aro-matica) (Borchert et al. 2004). However, none of these herbal drugshave been further developed towards a novel treatment option forOAB, and the need for effective and well tolerated phytopharma-ceuticals remains. Since B. pinnatum has been shown to effectivelyinhibit uterine contractions in vitro (Gwehenberger et al. 2004), andto produce few and only moderate side effects in vivo (Plangger et al. Fig. 2. Relaxant effect of B. pinnatum leaf press juice (A) and oxybutynin (B), respectively on carbachol-induced contractions of porcine detrusor muscle.

This publication demonstrated the effect of the leaf press juice as well as of the flavonoid , bufadienolide, and polar fraction s of B. pinnatum on porcine detrusor contractility in vitro . The leaf press juice was able to inhibit electrically stimulated detrusor concentration s in an organ bath. The flavonoid fraction (1 mg/mL) produced a 78.7% maximum inhibition of contr actility . Muscle strips treated with the bufadienolide fraction demonstrated no inhibitory effect s on detrusor contractility. The polar fraction demonstrated a n unexpected inhibitory effect ; however , this ef fect may be explained by a lower pH in the organ bath chamber caused by the presence of L-malic acid. Flavonoids are hypothesized to be responsible for the inhibitory effect on porcine detrusor muscle contractility. The preparation of the flavonoid, bu fadienolide, and polar fractions (liquid -liquid extraction and Diaion HP -20 CC), identification of the fractions constituents, the method development , in vitro experiment performance , the pH measurements , writing of the manuscript, and preparation of the figures (excep t for Fig. S3, S4 ) and tables were my contributions to this publication.

APCIMS analysis revealed four bufadienolides, which were unambiguously identified in the bufadienolide fraction (detailed results are provided as supporting information): bersaldegenin bersaldegenin -1,3,5 -orthoacetate (14) (Fig. 3). 123 Constituents of the polar fraction could not be identified by ESIMS and APCIMS. Therefore, 1H NMR analysis of the polar fraction was performed to identify its cons tituents. Based on the 1H NMR spectrum, the polar fraction contains mainly L -malic acid as well as different sugars (detailed results are provided as supporting information). Porcine blad der muscle strips For in vitro contractility experiments the Krebs solution (pH 7.4) Glucose (Sigma -Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), 4.6 KCl (Zurich canton pharmacy, Zurich, Switzerland), 1.5 CaCl 2 (Dr. Bender & Dr. Hobein AG, Zurich, Switzerland) 1.2 MgCl 2 x 6 H 2O (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), 1.2 NaH 2PO 4 x H 2O (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used (Badawi et al., 2006). Oxybutynin chlor ide (Fig. 4), L -malic acid, D -malic acid and succinic acid were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich. Porcine urinary bladders were obtained from the slaughterhouse in Zurich. They were from 5 months old female pigs weighing around 100 kg. Immediately after slaugh tering, bladders were kept in Krebs solution. All experiments were done within 9 hours after removal of bladders. Bladders were emptied before cutting off the dome and trigone. The urothelium was carefully removed from the detrusor. After, the serosa was r emoved and longitudinal muscle strips (5 x 2 x 1 mm3, 25 - 40 mg) were prepared. Eight muscle strips were deposited in Krebs solution (on ice) until use. Organ bath measurements The experiments were performed with a DMT 610M Multi Chamber Myograph connec ted to an 4/30 signal transducer and to a Grass S48 Electrical field stimulator. In the organ bath chamber (Krebs solution aired with 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2, 6 mL, 37\u00b0C) the strips were fixed between two jaws, which were connected either to a force transducer or a micropositioner. The electrical field stimulation (EFS) was performed with squared twin pulses with duration of 2 ms and an interval of 3 min. The muscle strips were stimulated for 5 seconds with a constant voltage and frequency (40 V, 32 Hz) and the contraction force recorded. After attaching the muscle strips, an equilibrium phase with 10 mN was applied. The stretching of the muscle strips was repeated after 5 and 10 min. Krebs solution was exchanged every 10 min. After 30 min o f equilibration, the baseline contraction force of each strip was set to zero. Before application of test solutions, the muscle strips were stimulated 7 times each 3 min by EFS to determine the maximum contraction of each strip. BPJ, fractions, oxybutynin, or control solution (Krebs solution or DMSO (0.5%)) were added in the corresponding concentration to the organ bath chamber.
