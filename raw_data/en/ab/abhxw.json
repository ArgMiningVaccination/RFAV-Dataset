To address this issue, next-generation vaccines are being developed to prevent antimicrobial resistance caused by MDR bacteria. Traditional vaccine platforms, such as inactivated vaccines (IVs) and live attenuated vaccines (LAVs), were effective in preventing bacterial infections. However, they have shown reduced efficacy against emerging antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including MDR M. tuberculosis. Additionally, the large-scale production of LAVs and IVs requires the growth of live pathogenic microorganisms. A more promising approach for the accelerated development of vaccines against antibiotic-resistant bacteria involves the use of in silico immunoinformatics techniques and reverse vaccinology. The bioinformatics approach can identify highly conserved antigenic targets capable of providing broader protection against emerging drug-resistant bacteria. Multi-epitope vaccines, such as recombinant protein-, DNA-, or mRNA-based vaccines, which incorporate several antigenic targets, offer the potential for accelerated development timelines. This review evaluates the potential of next-generation vaccine development based on the reverse vaccinology approach and highlights the development of safe and immunogenic vaccines through relevant examples from successful preclinical and clinical studies.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-07-20", "cleaned_text": "The Promising Potential of Reverse Vaccinology-Based Next-Generation Vaccine Development over Conventional Vaccines against Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria The discovery of penicillin in 1928 marked the start of medical interventions that enabled remarkable reductions in debilitating bacterial infections such as pneumonia and tuberculosis [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-01264), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-01264)]. As a result of antibiotics, mortality due to bacterial infections decreased significantly and the average life expectancy at birth increased from 47 to 78.8 years in the USA [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01264)]. However, the golden age of antibiotics was abruptly halted by the emergence of MDR bacterial strains, culminating in the present antibiotic resistance crisis [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01264)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01264)]. The impact of antibiotic resistance on individual health and wellbeing as well as on the economy is disastrous, as evidenced by an estimated 1.27 million global deaths as a result of antibiotic resistance in 2019 and projected healthcare treatment costs of $300 billion to well beyond $1 trillion by 2050 [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01264), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01264)]. [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01264)]. These antibiotics would, however, be subjected to similar selection pressures, resulting in the eventual emergence of strains becoming more resistant [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01264)]. A promising alternative involves the development of next-generation vaccines geared towards the prevention of antimicrobial resistance due to the emergence of MDR bacteria. This review provides a comprehensive overview of preclinical and clinical vaccine development against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 1.1. Mechanisms of Antibiotic Resistance Acquired through Horizontal Gene Transfer between Bacteria [15](#B15-vaccines-11-01264), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01264), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01264)]. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria can be acquired through horizontal gene transfer processes such as transformation, transduction, and conjugation. During transformation, donor bacteria release DNA fragments with resistance genes into the environment. Competent recipient bacteria can take up these fragments and integrate the resistance genes into their genome. This integration enables the recipient bacteria to produce proteins or enzymes that make them resistant to specific antibiotics. As a result, the transformed bacteria inherit antibiotic resistance, leading to the spread of resistance within bacterial populations. During transduction, bacteriophages can carry antibiotic resistance genes from a donor bacterium to a recipient bacterium. These genes can then become integrated into the recipient bacterium's chromosome. This integration allows the recipient bacterium to acquire and express the antibiotic resistance traits encoded by these genes, resulting in antibiotic resistance. During bacterial conjugation, antibiotic resistance genes are transferred through direct physical contact between the donor and the recipient bacteria. This process involves the formation of a physical bridge, called a pilus, between the two bacterial cells. The pilus facilitates the transfer of a plasmid, which carries the antibiotic resistance genes, from the donor bacterium to the recipient bacterium. Once inside the recipient bacterium, the plasmid is integrated into the chromosome [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01264)]. These processes are illustrated in [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01264-f001). 1.2. Reverse Vaccinology: An Innovative Approach to Vaccine Development against Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01264)]. This approach offers several advantages, such as the potential to simultaneously target multiple epitopes [ [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01264)]. This serves as an effective way to enhance the effectiveness of vaccines developed against highly diverse and rapidly evolving antibiotic-resistant strains. Furthermore, reverse vaccinology allows for a more rapid and targeted vaccine design process, accelerating the development timeline and potentially overcoming challenges associated with traditional approaches. As antibiotic resistance continues to pose a significant threat to global health, the reverse vaccinology approach offers promising prospects in the quest for effective vaccines against antibiotic-resistant bacteria [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01264)]. 2. Vaccines against Antimicrobial Resistance Based on Conventional Vaccine Platforms 2.1. LAVs [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01264)]. The disease is primarily prevalent in regions of South-East Asia, Africa, and the Western Pacific. The global burden of those infected with TB has been exacerbated by the emergence of MDR tuberculosis (TB) strains, which comprise TB strains that are resistant to at least the first-line treatment drugs isoniazid and rifampicin [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01264)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01264)]. There are other examples of effective LAVs being developed against bacteria. For example, anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) BioThrax is a licensed avirulent vaccine recommended for the immunization of individuals aged 18-65 years for the prevention of anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis. [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01264), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01264)]. The novel oral typhoid vaccine M01ZH09, as an LAV, was also shown to be safe and potently immunogenic [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-01264)]. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-01264)]. BCG vaccine administration using the pulmonary mucosal delivery route conferred protection in rhesus macaques associated with production of T-helper type 17 interleukin-10, and immunoglobulin A [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-01264)]. Intravenous BCG vaccination also protected 9 out of 10 rhesus macaques from TB infection [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-01264)]. [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01264)]. While it is true that the BCG vaccine did confer partial protection in infants, there are reports indicating that the vaccine is no longer effective in protecting adolescents and adults [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-01264)]. Martinez et al. (2022) reported that the effectiveness of the BCG vaccine in protecting against all forms of TB was only 18%. The vaccine only conferred significant levels of protection in infants less than 5 years of age. The vaccine also failed to confer significant levels of protection against extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The data suggested that booster immunizations were required in older populations in order to sustain protection against TB infection [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-01264)]. While the BCG vaccine did lead to a reduction in cases of miliary tuberculosis, the vaccine conferred minimal levels of protection against primary TB infection and the reactivation of latent pulmonary tuberculosis [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-01264), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-01264)]. [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01264), [35](#B35-vaccines-11-01264), [36](#B36-vaccines-11-01264)]. MTBVAC was shown to be an effective replacement for the BCG vaccine in a preclinical study that focused on the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the vaccine when it was administered to newborn C57/BL6 mice [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01264)]. No deaths or disease symptoms were reported in any of the mice immunized with the vaccine. There was also no impact on growth and organ development in mice. IFN- analysis after immunization demonstrated high IFN- production when splenocytes from mice were stimulated with Ag85B, the antigen expressed by MTB, or with purified protein derivative (PPD) as a control. An evaluation of the protective efficacy conferred by the vaccine showed that bacterial loads in the lungs and spleen were significantly reduced upon immunization with MTBVAC when compared to vaccination of mice with the BCG vaccine [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01264)]. [37](#B37-vaccines-11-01264)]. The discovery of MTBVAC as a live vaccine candidate as well as its development, characterization, and elicitation of immune responses in animals and humans have remarkably progressed over 25 years. The BCG vaccine is still regarded as the gold standard and phase III efficacy trials of MTBVAC have been conducted in TB-endemic countries of Sub-Saharan Africa in 2021 [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-01264)]. [39](#B39-vaccines-11-01264)]. 2.2. IVs [40](#B40-vaccines-11-01264)]. 2.3. Limitations of Conventional Vaccine Platforms [41](#B41-vaccines-11-01264)]. However, the emergence of highly infectious COVID-19 has led to the introduction of novel vaccine platforms and has also provided insight into the superiority of next-generation vaccine platforms over traditional vaccines such as LAVs and IVs. The pandemic has shed light on the limitations of traditional vaccination approaches. The use of conventional LAV platforms is not considered to be feasible or safe in terms of large-scale production of LAVs to vaccinate against viral diseases because of the danger it poses in terms of potential reversion to virulence through mutations or recombinations [ [42](#B42-vaccines-11-01264)]. The development of effective LAVs necessitates making multiple mutations in the genome, including deleterious gene mutations, altered replication potential, codon deoptimization, and gene regulation by microRNAs [ [43](#B43-vaccines-11-01264)]. Logically, the development of effective LAVs as vaccines could only be undertaken if there is extensive information about the bacterial genes and their functions so that any potential reversion to virulence could be prevented. This venture is made even more challenging as a result of aberrant gene expression arising from antibiotic usage, which is associated with higher rates of mutagenesis and greater virulence [ [44](#B44-vaccines-11-01264)]. [40](#B40-vaccines-11-01264)]. The challenge with using such inactivating chemical agents in IVs is that the high toxicity has to be neutralized by laboratory processes, such as removal, dilution, and/or conversion of the inactivating agent into a non-toxic form. Considering that the development of vaccines against AMR bacteria is geared towards the production of large quantities of vaccines for public immunization, these processes of growing significant amounts of bacteria could be considered to be tedious and time consuming [ [45](#B45-vaccines-11-01264)]. Furthermore, the inactivation process might leave the IV significantly less immunogenic, which would necessitate the production of large amounts of vaccine antigens to induce adequate immune responses [ [46](#B46-vaccines-11-01264)]. Live pathogens are needed to be grown in large quantities in order to cater to large-scale production, which could potentially pose an alarming problem of safety to personnel working in the plant [ [47](#B47-vaccines-11-01264)]. 3. Current Preclinical and Clinical Development of Next-Generation Vaccines against AMR Bacteria [48](#B48-vaccines-11-01264)]. Also, several severe adverse effects upon vaccination, such as myocarditis, have been increasingly reported, pointing to the need for more and longer term studies for evaluating the associated risks [ [49](#B49-vaccines-11-01264)]. The elicitation of humoral and cellular immune responses from the administration of next-generation vaccine platforms such as DNA, mRNA, and recombinant protein vaccines is illustrated in [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01264-f002). 3.1. Recombinant Protein Vaccines 3.1.1. Advantages of Recombinant Protein Vaccines [50](#B50-vaccines-11-01264)]. The advantage associated with immunization using recombinant protein vaccines is that they do not require the use of cold chain storage in freezers and liquid nitrogen to store and preserve the vaccine at temperatures lower than 80 \u00b0C, which suggests that they could be used to immunize populations in resource-poor third world countries lacking cold chain facilities. Indeed, recombinant protein vaccines may be freeze-dried or lyophilized, allowing them to be preserved in a dried powdered form. For example, Lai et al. (2021) discussed the development of insect cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain constructs compatible with lyophilization and storage in a dry thermostabilized state [ [51](#B51-vaccines-11-01264)]. Moreover, freeze-dried, heat-stable formulations of influenza subunit vaccines were safe and immunogenic when administered to mice [52](#B52-vaccines-11-01264)]. [53](#B53-vaccines-11-01264)]. Baculovirus-mediated expression using Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells has emerged as a widely accepted method for producing recombinant glycoproteins. This approach is favored due to its simplicity and rapidity in expressing foreign proteins. Moreover, it offers a high likelihood of obtaining biologically active proteins, further contributing to its popularity in the field of protein production [ [54](#B54-vaccines-11-01264)]. Moreover, the resemblance of protein secretion pathways between yeasts and higher eukaryotic organisms has meant that yeasts such as Pichia pastoris (syn Komagataella spp.) are now also widely recognized as favorable hosts for the production of various recombinant proteins [ [55](#B55-vaccines-11-01264)]. The extracellular secretion of recombinant proteins by yeasts simplifies the downstream purification process, making it more cost effective [ [56](#B56-vaccines-11-01264)]. 3.1.2. Disadvantages of Recombinant Protein Vaccines [57](#B57-vaccines-11-01264), [58](#B58-vaccines-11-01264)]. [59](#B59-vaccines-11-01264)]. Nevertheless, endotoxins may be conveniently removed from purified proteins through the use of a porous cellulose bead surface modified with covalently attached poly(-lysine) chains, which possesses high binding affinity for endotoxins. The purified proteins may then be monitored for endotoxins using endotoxin quantification assays [ [60](#B60-vaccines-11-01264)]. 3.1.3. Recombinant Protein Vaccine Candidates [61](#B61-vaccines-11-01264)]. The recombinant VPM1002 vaccine was shown to be superior to the BCG vaccine in terms of immunogenicity and safety in several ways [ [61](#B61-vaccines-11-01264)]. Through the characteristic expression of a hemolysin known as listeriolysin (Hly), which was isolated from Listeria monocytogenes, the VPM1002 vaccine candidate was able to direct the efficient translocation of antigens to the cytosol where they could be presented to CD8+ T cells. It was also demonstrated that immunization with the VPM1002 vaccine candidate could elicit CD8+ T cells and stimulate CD4+ memory T cells, including increased production of T helper 1 (TH1) and TH17 cells, far more significantly than the administration of the BCG vaccine. The safety level associated with VPM1002 immunization was higher than that linked with BCG immunization, as evidenced by more accelerated clearance of the VPM1002 vaccine from the host cell tissue as compared to increased persistence of the BCG vaccine [ [62](#B62-vaccines-11-01264)]. [63](#B63-vaccines-11-01264)]. Indeed, the traditional BCG vaccine has significantly lost vaccine protective efficacy against M. tuberculosis Beijing/W genotype strains. The BCG vaccine could confer only very modest levels of protection in animal models infected with the M. tuberculosis Beijing/W strain [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01264), [64](#B64-vaccines-11-01264)]. Moreover, Grode et al. (2005) corroborated this experimental finding in BALB/c mice whereby mice immunized with the BCG vaccine showed minimal or complete lack of protection against an M. tuberculosis Beijing/W strain [ [65](#B65-vaccines-11-01264)]. [65](#B65-vaccines-11-01264)]. [66](#B66-vaccines-11-01264)]. Considering that therapeutic and preventive anti-TB interventions are accessible to only a small fraction of these children, current vaccines against MDR-TB are also being tested in children. After successfully progressing through the preclinical and early stages of clinical development, the VPM1002 vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in infants in different regions of Africa. The results of the safety and immunogenicity of VPM1002 in phase II clinical development in 48 newborn infants immunized with the VPM1002 vaccine or the BCG Danish vaccine strain showed that whilst both vaccines were able to elicit interleukin-17 (IL-17) responses, only the VPM1002 vaccine resulted in increased stimulation of CD8+ IL-17+ T cells at week 16 and at the 6-month time point. Abscess formation was less commonly observed in participants immunized with the VPM1002 vaccine when compared with the BCG vaccine [ [62](#B62-vaccines-11-01264)]. These results corroborated the findings obtained with the VPM1002 vaccine in phase I clinical trials conducted in adults [ [67](#B67-vaccines-11-01264)]. Another phase II study for VPM1002 is ongoing [ [68](#B68-vaccines-11-01264)]. [69](#B69-vaccines-11-01264)]. After confirmation of high levels of the expression of exogenous genes from the vector pIBCG, the protein-based vaccine was administered to BALB/c mice inoculated with rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis, which was also administered with a second-line anti-TB drug regimen. Upon administration of the vaccine, M. tuberculosis burden in the lungs was reduced by one log. Lung tissue pathology was also reduced when the vaccine was administered together with the anti-TB drugs. Administration of the recombinant protein-based vaccine led to the inhibition of M. tuberculosis growth and development. The expressed proteins, Ag85B and Rv2628, acted as potent antigens and led to elicitation of the Th1 immune response, which sustained the continuous inhibition of rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis [ [69](#B69-vaccines-11-01264)]. [70](#B70-vaccines-11-01264)]. Thus, the Yidr recombinant protein vaccine could serve as a promising vaccine candidate against K. pneumoniae. 3.2. DNA Vaccines 3.2.1. Advantages of DNA Vaccines [71](#B71-vaccines-11-01264)]. It is also relatively easy to produce DNA vaccines in large quantities for distribution and large-scale immunization in under-developed countries [ [72](#B72-vaccines-11-01264)]. The recombinant plasmid DNA can be conveniently produced in large quantities in bacteria, such as E. coli, or expressed in eukaryotic cells, such as HEK-293 T cells [ [72](#B72-vaccines-11-01264)]. 3.2.2. Disadvantages of DNA Vaccines [73](#B73-vaccines-11-01264), [74](#B74-vaccines-11-01264)]. Another concern is the risk of genomic integration, where the introduced DNA may become integrated into the recipient's genome. While the likelihood of this event is low, it is an important aspect to consider during vaccine development [ [75](#B75-vaccines-11-01264)]. To improve immunogenicity, DNA vaccines often require the use of adjuvants, which can increase the immune response but may also introduce additional complexities and potential side effects [ [76](#B76-vaccines-11-01264)]. Furthermore, the administration of DNA vaccines typically requires a medical device like the use of an electroporator that can deliver electric pulses to facilitate the uptake of DNA by cells [ [77](#B77-vaccines-11-01264)]. This requirement may limit the accessibility and widespread use of DNA vaccines, particularly in resource-limited settings lacking such specialized equipment. Although needleless patch administration is an alternative being explored, it is still under development and not widely available. 3.2.3. DNA Vaccine Candidates [78](#B78-vaccines-11-01264)]. Furthermore, Hashemzehi et al. (2018) expressed the NlpA gene as the main antigen in expression vectors pTZ57R/T and pEGFP-C2, followed by their administration in BALB/c mice. Elevated levels of IgG, IgM, INF-, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 were observed in the immunized mice [ [79](#B79-vaccines-11-01264)]. 3.3. mRNA Vaccines [80](#B80-vaccines-11-01264)]. Due to the rapid emergence of resistant strains, the clinical progression of vaccine development involves high costs and long regulatory processes [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01264)]. 3.3.1. Advantages of mRNA Vaccines [81](#B81-vaccines-11-01264)]. The mRNA vaccines served as highly effective and safe anti-COVID-19 vaccines but did not protect vaccinated patients from passing on the virus [ [82](#B82-vaccines-11-01264), [83](#B83-vaccines-11-01264)]. Smith et al. (2020) expressed the view that nucleic acid vaccines such as DNA and mRNA vaccines offer certain advantages that are well suited to combat rapidly emerging variants. A number of vaccine candidates could be efficiently and quickly developed, progress at an accelerated speed from the preclinical to the clinical stages through already established regulatory pathways, and be manufactured in abundant amounts for large-scale immunization [ [84](#B84-vaccines-11-01264)]. Multiple mRNA vaccine candidates might be developed by simply changing the nucleotide sequence of the main antigenic region when faced with emerging resistant pathogenic strains. 3.3.2. Disadvantages of mRNA Vaccines [85](#B85-vaccines-11-01264)]. This requirement poses logistical challenges, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized cold chain infrastructure. Additionally, the manufacturing process for mRNA vaccines involves a complex two-step in vitro reaction and purification platform. Multiple intricate steps, including DNase digestion, precipitation, and chromatography or tangential flow filtration are required [ [86](#B86-vaccines-11-01264)]. These steps can be time consuming and demanding, requiring specialized equipment and expertise. Consequently, the production costs may be higher, and the overall manufacturing process may be slower compared to conventional vaccines. Despite these challenges, ongoing research aims to address these limitations by developing new technologies that improve the stability and simplify the production process of mRNA vaccines, thereby enhancing their accessibility and scalability. 3.3.3. mRNA Vaccine Candidates [64](#B64-vaccines-11-01264)]. The in cationic liposomes, including -galactosylceramide (-GC) as an adjuvant, and used for the immunization of C57BL/6J mice. The use of an adjuvant led to the activation of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and specific T cell responses. Experiments showed that immunization with the top vaccine candidate, LMON_0149, was able to confer protection in mice when challenged with L. monocytogene due to the elicitation of strong cellular immune responses [ [87](#B87-vaccines-11-01264)]. [88](#B88-vaccines-11-01264)]. The status of Y. pestis as a serious bioterrorism agent is owing to its high infectivity, pathogenicity, alarming mortality, as well as the emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant strains of Y. pestis, which warrants the development of an effective vaccine to prevent the occurrence of outbreaks caused by antibiotic-resistant strains of Y. pestis. Two mRNA-LNP vaccine candidates were constructed based on the F1 capsular antigen (caf1). One that contained the bacterial F1 capsular antigen together with a signal peptide (SP) originating from the human Ig right chain and one that contained the non-secreted SP-caf1, which lacked the native signal sequence, were encapsulated in mRNA-LNP formulations and used for immunization experiments. Immunogenicity was investigated in mice that were immunized three times with 5 \u00b5g of each construct, SP-caf1-hFc or SP-caf1. Potent anti-F1 humoral and antigen-specific cellular immune responses were elicited as a result of immunization with both vaccine candidates. Furthermore, challenge of the immunized mice with a high dose of virulent Y. pestis demonstrated that both vaccine candidates were able to offer full protection against the virulent Y. pestis Kimberly 53 strain. In contrast, na\u00efve mice were not able to survive the challenge [ [88](#B88-vaccines-11-01264)]. Therefore, the data indicated that the mRNA-LNP vaccine platform could serve as an effective mode of immunization against emerging bacterial strains, especially those that have acquired resistance against current antibiotics. [89](#B89-vaccines-11-01264)]. Anaphylaxis resulting from immunization with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was shown to be attributable to the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Allergy skin prick testing showed that anaphylaxis was induced when polyethylene glycol was used [ [90](#B90-vaccines-11-01264)]. This underscores the importance of adhering to safety protocols during investigations, emphasizing the need for safety testing when utilizing LNPs containing PEG compounds. The advantages and limitations associated with the use of next-generation vaccines relative to conventional vaccine platforms are summarized in [Table 1](#vaccines-11-01264-t001). 3.4. Comparison between Next-Generation mRNA, Recombinant Protein, and DNA Vaccines 3.4.1. Safety [91](#B91-vaccines-11-01264)]. New advancements offer potential remedies for various disease conditions in the context of biomedical technologies. However, it is crucial to carefully assess the potential risks associated with their usage. mRNA technology, being a relatively novel approach, necessitates the consideration of safety concerns, not only in existing products but also in future developments. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct further research to ensure the safety of both current and future users of this technology. [92](#B92-vaccines-11-01264)]. So far, there has been no evidence showing plasmid integration into genomes. [56](#B56-vaccines-11-01264)]. 3.4.2. Vaccine Protective Efficacy and Breadth of Immune Responses [93](#B93-vaccines-11-01264)]. [94](#B94-vaccines-11-01264)]. Following the initial immunization, mRNA and recombinant protein vaccines induced detectable levels of RBD-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies, with significantly higher levels seen after the second immunization. Notably, by day 35 after the first vaccination, the mRNA vaccine group exhibited notably elevated neutralizing antibody titers compared to the recombinant protein vaccine group. The recombinant protein vaccine group demonstrated its highest antibody titers on day 21 after the initial vaccination, whereas the mRNA vaccine group reached its peak response on day 35 following the first immunization. The recombinant protein vaccine induced a faster humoral immune response compared to the mRNA vaccine, while the mRNA vaccine required a longer duration to induce its peak immune response. Therefore, even though both platforms were able to elicit potent immune responses, the differences in terms of the time taken to reach peak immune response might differ between different vaccine platforms [ [94](#B94-vaccines-11-01264)]. 4. Immunoinformatic Approaches for the Development of Multi-Epitope Vaccines 4.1. Immunoinformatics Tools for Epitope Prediction and Analysis [95](#B95-vaccines-11-01264)]. [96](#B96-vaccines-11-01264)]. This strategy might prove to be more effective when compared to the use of full-length protein sequences that are highly susceptible to mutations, leading to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. The literature provides extensive evidence for the development of multi-epitope vaccines against a variety of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 4.2. Literature Review: Immunoinformatics Approaches in Vaccine Development [68](#B68-vaccines-11-01264)]. PspA and CbpA selected as potential CTL epitopes while PhtD and PiuA were chosen as the helper T cell epitopes. The PorB protein was chosen to serve as a TLR2 agonist to increase the potency of the immune response. Molecular docking analysis confirmed that there was an appropriate and stable interaction between the vaccine and TLR2. Based on computational analysis, the chosen epitopes could be joined together with linkers to yield a multi-epitope vaccine capable of stimulating both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against S. pneumoniae [ [97](#B97-vaccines-11-01264)]. [98](#B98-vaccines-11-01264)]. Molecular docking simulations were used to predict the compatibility of the interaction models of the vaccine-receptor (TLR) complex, vaccine-MHC complexes, and vaccine-B cell receptor (BCR) complex. Simulation of the immune responses, population coverage analysis, and in silico molecular cloning were performed. Following immunoinformatics analysis, five cytotoxic (CTL) epitopes, five helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, and seven B cell linear epitopes from the CdeC protein, which plays an essential role in spore germination, and the fliD protein, which is responsible for propagule colonization, were chosen for constructing the vaccine. The adjuvant LT-IIb was incorporated into the vaccine N-terminus through the use of the EAAAK linker to optimize the elicited immune response. Since the elicitation of intestinal mucosal immunity is integral for protection against C. difficile, it is necessary to assess the ability of the vaccine to induce secretory immunoglobulin A (s1gA) production by IgA plasma cells in future studies [ [98](#B98-vaccines-11-01264)]. [99](#B99-vaccines-11-01264)]. A total of three proteins, namely Fe2+-enterobactin, ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, and fimbriae biogenesis outer membrane usher protein, were shown to be antigenic. Seven epitopes were selected from these three antigens to construct a vaccine comprising seven epitopes joined together by GPGPG linkers. Moreover, the adjuvant from the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTBS) was added to the vaccine construct to enhance immunogenicity. Molecular docking analysis to test interactions of the vaccine with MHC-I, MHC-II, and TLR4 showed that the vaccine construct was able to elicit a potent immune response [ [100](#B100-vaccines-11-01264)]. [101](#B101-vaccines-11-01264)]. The bacterium was reported to be resistant to beta-lactam and tetracycline antibiotics and contributes to a large number of hospital-acquired infections. Reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics approaches were used to identify the core proteome. An extracellular curlin minor subunit CsgB and two periplasmic membrane proteins were selected as the main antigens for the identification of B and T cell epitopes. In the vaccine construct, a total of three epitopes were joined together using GPGPG and EAAAK linkers to link the cholera toxin B subunit as an adjuvant to optimize the elicited immune response. Molecular docking and binding free energy calculations showed effective interactions between the vaccine construct and MHC-I, MHC-II, and TLR-4 [ [101](#B101-vaccines-11-01264)]. However, such computation-based molecular simulations would require further experimental validation in vitro and in vivo. [102](#B102-vaccines-11-01264)]. Further experimental validation, both in vitro and in vivo, of the computer-aided vaccine design is required. [103](#B103-vaccines-11-01264)]. An in silico approach was used to determine that the 15-mer T cell epitope (AMATGWLQYNGSWYY) showed high affinity for MHC class I and class II molecules and exhibited high population coverage. T cell-, B cell-, and IFN-inducing epitopes were also selected based on a strong affinity between the MEV and TLRs. It was proposed that the vaccine would induce both humoral and cell-mediated responses [ [103](#B103-vaccines-11-01264)]. [104](#B104-vaccines-11-01264)]. Specifically, the yersiniabactin receptor of E. coli UMN026 and the flagellin protein of Stenotrophomonas maltophila were chosen. B cell linear epitopes were predicted using the Bepipred tool, and peptide binding with a reference set of 27 alleles of MHC class I and class II molecules were analyzed. Simulation dynamics were used to validate the predicted peptide-MHC complexes. The chimeric construct was created through in silico methods and codon optimization. The immunoinformatics analysis demonstrated that the chimeric construct, composed of gene fragments specifying a significant number of predicted peptides, was highly immunogenic. It was observed that the chimeric construct was more immunogenic, as evidenced an increase in the number of B cell and T cell epitopes and an expansion of the coverage of world populations with allelic variability [ [104](#B104-vaccines-11-01264)]. 4.3. Reverse Vaccinology: An Innovative Approach to Vaccine Development against Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria 5. From Research to Real-World Experience: Currently Approved and Clinical Development of Experimental Vaccines against Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria 5.1. S. enterica Serovar Typhi [105](#B105-vaccines-11-01264), [106](#B106-vaccines-11-01264)]. After the lymphoid through lymphatic and hematogenous routes [ [107](#B107-vaccines-11-01264)]. Typhoid emerges as a fever in the first week that progressively exacerbates to abdominal pain, constipation, and macular rashes in the second week, and to liver and spleen enlargement, ileocecal perforation, peritonitis, and septic shock in week 3. Death might result if the infection remains untreated [ [108](#B108-vaccines-11-01264), [109](#B109-vaccines-11-01264)]. [110](#B110-vaccines-11-01264), [111](#B111-vaccines-11-01264)]. The live attenuated Ty21a vaccine was shown to elicit immune responses to S. typhi lipopolysaccharide in the intestinal tract, thereby conferring protective immunity [ [112](#B112-vaccines-11-01264)]. The elicitation of an effective immune response required four immunization doses administered on alternate days [ [113](#B113-vaccines-11-01264)]. [114](#B114-vaccines-11-01264)]. Phase III clinical trials conducted in four hospitals in Kathmandu, Dhulikhel, Dharan, and Nepalgunj in Nepal showed that the typhoid Vi polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid (Vi-DT) vaccine was safe in terms of an anti-Vi-IgG seroconversion rate of 99.33%, showing a good safety profile [ [115](#B115-vaccines-11-01264)]. Moreover, the phase III clinical development of a Typhoid Vi conjugate vaccine (TCV) was reported to be safe, tolerable, and immunogenic in Malawian children from 9 to 12 years of age. Upon administration of TCV, there was a significant elevation of anti-Vi IgG geometric mean titers from 4\u00b72 EU/mL at baseline to 2383\u00b77 EU/mL at day 28 [ [116](#B116-vaccines-11-01264)]. Another important candidate that is being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial consisted of a novel bivalent oral vaccine against enteric fever caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A. The vaccine incorporates two antigens, flagellin H:a and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O:2, to target both Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A [ [117](#B117-vaccines-11-01264)]. Additionally, there are also eight vaccine candidates against Salmonella typhi in the preclinical stage of development. 5.2. H. influenzae Type b [118](#B118-vaccines-11-01264)]. In areas where vaccines were extensively administered, invasive H. influenzae type b (Hib) disease in children was all but eliminated as a result of the invention and widespread use of Hib conjugate vaccines [ [118](#B118-vaccines-11-01264)]. By lowering the nasopharyngeal carriage of Hib, Hib conjugate vaccines also helped to lower the number of circulating strains of the disease in the general population [ [119](#B119-vaccines-11-01264)]. [120](#B120-vaccines-11-01264)]. In fact, since the 1990s, invasive H. influenzae infections in children under 5 years of age had disappeared in developed countries as a result of Hib vaccine administration [ [121](#B121-vaccines-11-01264)]. It has been demonstrated that vaccination against H. influenzae lowered the prevalence of specific drug-resistant H. influenzae strains [ [122](#B122-vaccines-11-01264)]. The vaccine efficacy (VE) of current Hib vaccinations is approximately 94% [ [123](#B123-vaccines-11-01264)]. Additionally, three of the four more promising vaccines are currently undergoing or have recently completed phase III clinical trials [ [120](#B120-vaccines-11-01264)]. The pediatric hexavalent vaccine Shan 6 (NCT04429295) successfully demonstrated potent immunogenicity and a good safety profile in 2021 and is in the process of applying for New Drug Application approval [ [124](#B124-vaccines-11-01264)]. Another promising candidate with its phase I clinical development conducted in 2019 is the LBVD vaccine, a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, and Hib vaccine [ [125](#B125-vaccines-11-01264)]. Although safe and immunogenic vaccines for Hib are available for immunization against the disease, future efforts would need to focus on immunizing more people and overcoming the challenges of global coverage in order to curb the spread of drug-resistant Hib strains [ [126](#B126-vaccines-11-01264)]. 5.3. S. pneumoniae [120](#B120-vaccines-11-01264)]. While some of these vaccines are conjugate vaccines, others incorporate outer membrane vesicles, recombinant proteins, pathogen-agnostic mechanisms, and multiple antigen presentation systems [ [127](#B127-vaccines-11-01264), [128](#B128-vaccines-11-01264), [129](#B129-vaccines-11-01264), [130](#B130-vaccines-11-01264)]. The ability of mucosal maternal vaccination with new pneumococcal vaccines to confer protection to offspring from pneumococcal infections has also been studied in preclinical models. [120](#B120-vaccines-11-01264)]. These vaccine candidates were modeled after some licensed pneumococcal vaccines that combined the purified capsular polysaccharides of pneumococcal serotypes conjugated to a carrier protein [ [131](#B131-vaccines-11-01264)]. Four vaccines, including two 13-valent vaccines, a 15-valent euPCV vaccine, and a protein-based pneumococcal vaccine, are undergoing phase I clinical trials. Notably, the protein-based pneumococcal vaccine can cover 70% of [ [120](#B120-vaccines-11-01264)]. [132](#B132-vaccines-11-01264)]. A multiple antigen-presenting system used in the MAPS vaccine demonstrated proof of concept in phase I studies and has advanced to phase II. Phase III clinical trials are ongoing for four vaccine candidates, the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide Pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) [120](#B120-vaccines-11-01264)]. Only one of these specifically targets Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), K. pneumoniae, and uropathogenic E. coli. There are four ExPEC vaccine candidates in clinical studies. A phase III clinical trial (NCT04899336) for the 9-valent O-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, ExPEC9V, started in June 2021 and is anticipated to end in May 2027 [ [133](#B133-vaccines-11-01264)]. Another polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, ExPEC10V, is undergoing phase I/II clinical testing (NCT03819049) [ [134](#B134-vaccines-11-01264)]. The vaccine is carrier protein, an exotoxin A (EPA) from P. aeruginosa that has undergone genetic detoxification [ [135](#B135-vaccines-11-01264)]. [136](#B136-vaccines-11-01264)]. The vaccine OM-89 is made up of membrane proteins from 18 different strains of E. coli that are heat-inactivated. A phase II clinical trial of the vaccine candidate (NCT02591901) was conducted to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) [ [137](#B137-vaccines-11-01264)]. Whole-cell vaccines, like UroVaxom and Solco-Urovac, were thought to have less-than ideal qualities because the compositions were not well described [ [138](#B138-vaccines-11-01264)]. [139](#B139-vaccines-11-01264)]. In comparison with meningococcal and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides, the O antigen is also far more difficult to purify as a polysaccharide. Due to these drawbacks and the requirement for a multivalent vaccine to effectively prevent ExPEC-associated illness, the development of an ExPEC vaccine has been subject to delay and postponement [ [140](#B140-vaccines-11-01264)]. 5.5. S. enterica Serovar Paratyphi A [120](#B120-vaccines-11-01264)]. These vaccine candidates are bivalent in nature and were shown to protect against both Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A [ [141](#B141-vaccines-11-01264)]. [142](#B142-vaccines-11-01264)]. [143](#B143-vaccines-11-01264)]. Phase IIb clinical conducted for the bivalent Entervax live attenuated whole-cell vaccine targeting both Salmonella Paratyphi A and Salmonella Typhi and were proposed to end in August 2021 (NCT01405521) [ [144](#B144-vaccines-11-01264)]. It was expected that vaccination against Salmonella Typhi would be combined with a vaccine against Salmonella Paratyphi A. The value of such a bivalent vaccine would be superior to either monovalent vaccine [ [145](#B145-vaccines-11-01264)]. A common target for vaccines, the Vi (virulence) capsular polysaccharide, is structurally absent from Salmonella Paratyphi A. Since recent progress in creating the typhoid conjugate vaccine is encouraging, this has raised the possibility of generating a vaccine for Salmonella Paratyphi A [ [146](#B146-vaccines-11-01264)]. [147](#B147-vaccines-11-01264)]. 5.6. C. difficile [90](#B90-vaccines-11-01264)]. These vaccines utilized several distinct delivery methods, including the MAPS platform, exome-like bacterial vesicles, and Bacillus subtilis spores. There are at present no licensed vaccines available to prevent C. difficile infection. However, two recombinant vaccine candidates were undergoing clinical testing. Phase I of the GSK2904545A recombinant protein vaccine was completed in April 2022 (NCT04026009) [ [148](#B148-vaccines-11-01264)]. The US FDA expedited the review of the PF-06425090 vaccine candidate in 2014. The phase III trial, which enrolled 17,500 patients, showed that administration of the vaccine candidate shortened the duration and severity of illness based on secondary endpoints, but it did not achieve the primary aim of avoiding C. difficile infections (NCT03090191) [ [149](#B149-vaccines-11-01264), [150](#B150-vaccines-11-01264)]. [151](#B151-vaccines-11-01264)]. The results of this trial\u2014the first global phase III study to assess vaccination against C. difficile infection\u2014highlighted the challenges involved in developing a vaccine for bacterial infections. The immunological response might have been impacted by the advanced age of the participants and the prevalence of comorbid conditions. Participants were also very susceptible to C. difficile infections. However, given the erratic epidemiology, a sizable population would need to be immunized. The phase II study utilizing the recombinant vaccine VLA84 was completed in 2015 (NCT02316470) [ [152](#B152-vaccines-11-01264)]. [153](#B153-vaccines-11-01264)]. Vaccines might aim to prevent either the first infection or the recurrence of C. difficile infections, which are very distinct goals. A reduction in symptoms might be achievable, according to recent results from vaccine candidates in clinical testing, but C. difficile might still survive in the host [ [154](#B154-vaccines-11-01264)]. The successful development of a C. difficile toxin antibody suggests that vaccination could be effective if it could deliver local antibodies into the gut [ [155](#B155-vaccines-11-01264)]. 5.7. N. gonorrhoeae [156](#B156-vaccines-11-01264)]. The 4CMenB vaccine, which has been approved to protect against group B meningococcal infection, might also offer protection from gonorrhea [ [157](#B157-vaccines-11-01264)]. [158](#B158-vaccines-11-01264), [159](#B159-vaccines-11-01264)]. These issues have led to a lack of optimism for the creation of an effective vaccine that might be used for the prevention of gonorrhea [ [160](#B160-vaccines-11-01264)]. 5.8. N. meningitidis (CPS) that surrounds pathogenic meningococci was shown to be essential for the survival and growth of the bacterium inside the body [ [163](#B163-vaccines-11-01264)]. Serogroups A, B, C, W, X, and Y are the most common serogroups causing invasive meningococcal disease. Early efforts focused on vaccine development against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W used the CPS as the primary antigen but they were not successful in the protection of infants. This was followed by the development of polysaccharide-conjugated vaccines to serogroups A, C, W, and Y (Men ACWY) by conjugating meningococcal A, C, W, and Y polysaccharides to a diphtheria toxoid protein carrier, which was able to confer protection in young children by preventing nasopharyngeal carriage [ [164](#B164-vaccines-11-01264)]. Moreover, the use of potently immunogenic conjugate vaccine against N. C significantly reduced the incidence of N. meningitidis serogroup C disease in Europe and North America [ [165](#B165-vaccines-11-01264)]. [164](#B164-vaccines-11-01264)]. Despite the existence of vaccines for multiple serogroups of N. meningitidis, traditional vaccines based on the B polysaccharide could not confer adequate protection against serogroup B (MenB). This was due to the similarity of the serogroup B meningococcal capsular polysaccharide with the sugars present on the surface of human cells and the likelihood of inducing an auto-immune responses, which could affect polysialic acid (PSA) located in human cells [ [166](#B166-vaccines-11-01264)]. Antibodies arising from immunization with B polysaccharide could result in abnormal CNS development in the unborn child [ [167](#B167-vaccines-11-01264)]. [165](#B165-vaccines-11-01264)]. The vaccine was capable of eliciting broad immune coverage. Following phase II and III clinical trials, the vaccine was licensed for public immunization in 2013 [ [165](#B165-vaccines-11-01264), [167](#B167-vaccines-11-01264)]. [168](#B168-vaccines-11-01264)]. The human serum bactericidal measure antibodies immunized with the MenB vaccine [ [169](#B169-vaccines-11-01264)]. Immunogenicity and safety studies conducted in adolescents upon immunization with the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine demonstrated robust hSBA responses and the vaccine was well tolerated, with three doses eliciting the strongest immune response against MenB strains expressing B fHbps [ [170](#B170-vaccines-11-01264)]. 5.9. ETEC [90](#B90-vaccines-11-01264)]. ETVAX, an IV that showed immune responses against four E. coli strains, has progressed to phase IIb clinical development. This candidate incorporates the use of dmLT as an immunogen and an adjuvant [ [171](#B171-vaccines-11-01264), [172](#B172-vaccines-11-01264), [173](#B173-vaccines-11-01264), [174](#B174-vaccines-11-01264)]. [175](#B175-vaccines-11-01264)]. [176](#B176-vaccines-11-01264)]. Moreover, an LAV candidate known as ACE527-102, which was composed of E. coli CS1, CS2, CS3, and CS5, colonization factor antigen I (CFAI), and the heat-labile toxin (LT) B subunit, was able to elicit potent immune responses but could not protect immunized participants against moderate/severe diarrhea [ [177](#B177-vaccines-11-01264)]. [178](#B178-vaccines-11-01264)]. Nevertheless, there were promising reports that a vaccine focused on the LT toxoid and CFA antigens was able to provide protection against 80% of pathogenic ETEC strains. There is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine for protection against ETEC in low- or middle-income countries (LMICs). The value of such a vaccine might be further enhanced by the development of a future vaccine that could protect against ETEC as well as other pathogenic bacteria [ [179](#B179-vaccines-11-01264)]. 5.10. K. pneumoniae [180](#B180-vaccines-11-01264)]. The most extensively investigated virulence factor of these is the capsule, which is produced by gene products from the capsular polysaccharide synthesis (CPS) locus. Bacterial capsule-targeted vaccines might serve as an effective strategy to immunize against encapsulated pathogens, as evidenced by the success vaccines pneumoniae, K1 capsule polysaccharide (CPS) developed in 1985 and several polyvalent K. pneumoniae CPS vaccines were developed in 1986, but these vaccines were associated with the elicitation of only T cell responses without the elicitation of high affinity neutralizing antibodies [ [183](#B183-vaccines-11-01264), [184](#B184-vaccines-11-01264), [185](#B185-vaccines-11-01264), [186](#B186-vaccines-11-01264)]. (B classified as T-dependent (T-D) or T-independent (T-I), based on the requirement for T cell help in antibody production.) [181](#B181-vaccines-11-01264)]. Indeed, this was demonstrated by the use of K1 (K1-ORF34) and K2 (K2-ORF16) CPS depolymerases to cleave K1 and K2 CPSs into intact structural units of oligosaccharides. To create CPS-conjugated vaccines, the resulting K1 and K2 oligosaccharides were individually with CRM197 Both and K2 CPS-conjugated vaccines generated anti-CPS antibodies with 128-fold and 64-fold increases in bactericidal activity, respectively, compared to animals without vaccination. Challenge studies showed that the divalent vaccine (a combination of K1 and K2 CPS-conjugated vaccines) and K1 or K2 CPS-conjugated vaccines protected mice from subsequent infections of K. pneumoniae by the corresponding capsular type [ [181](#B181-vaccines-11-01264)]. [187](#B187-vaccines-11-01264), [188](#B188-vaccines-11-01264), [189](#B189-vaccines-11-01264)]. In low-income countries, K. pneumoniae has been linked to a significant burden of newborn sepsis. Safety and immunogenicity results of the administration of a polyvalent Klebsiella vaccine mild adverse reactions with strong immune protection. Subcutaneous immunization of 40 individuals with 50 g of each antigen was able to elicit a 4-fold more potent immunoglobulin G (IgG) response as compared to the immune response elicited from 25 g of each antigen [ [185](#B185-vaccines-11-01264)]. Furthermore, passive protection conferred by IgGs obtained from the sera of immunized participants was observed against fatal experimental Klebsiella sepsis [ [185](#B185-vaccines-11-01264)]. trial, KlebV4, a tetravalent bioconjugated vaccine candidate, was recently evaluated both with and without the AS03 adjuvant (NCT04959344). [194](#B194-vaccines-11-01264), [195](#B195-vaccines-11-01264)]. vulgaris, and Enterococcus faecalis, has been licensed in Spain since 2010 but is undergoing clinical evaluation in Canada [ [196](#B196-vaccines-11-01264)]. A prospective study conducted with 75 women suggested that Uromune was safe and effective at preventing UTIs in women, as evidenced by the fact that of the 75 women who completed treatment, 59 (78%) had no subsequent UTIs in the follow-up period. Prior to treatment, all women had experienced a minimum of three or more episodes of UTI during the preceding 12 months [ [197](#B197-vaccines-11-01264)]. In addition, in the 2019 European Association of Urology guidelines, MV140 was suggested as an immunoactive prophylaxis to prevent the occurrence of recurrent UTIs, and it was shown in retrospective trials to be up to 90% more effective than antibiotic prophylaxis [ [180](#B180-vaccines-11-01264)]. 5.11. P. aeruginosa [198](#B198-vaccines-11-01264)]. Patients who have recently been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), those with compromised immune systems, and those who have previously been exposed to antipseudomonal carbapenems and fluoroquinolones were reported to be at the highest risk of contracting infections caused by MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa [ [198](#B198-vaccines-11-01264)]. It is also associated with burn wound infections, ventilation-associated pneumonia, and chronic infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients [ [199](#B199-vaccines-11-01264)]. Indeed, P. aeruginosa is well endowed with virulence factors that enable it to infect host cells and escape human adaptive immune responses, leading to the emergence of new infections [ [200](#B200-vaccines-11-01264)]. One of its primary virulence factors is the type 3 secretion system (T3SS), through which it injects effector proteins directly into host cells. These effector proteins are known to affect a variety of cell functions, such as disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, which leads to apoptosis-like cell death [ [201](#B201-vaccines-11-01264)]. [202](#B202-vaccines-11-01264)]. The vaccine was developed from an auxotrophic strain of the bacterium lacking the essential enzyme involved in producing D-glutamate, a structural component of the bacterial cell wall. Therefore, while the virulence of this strain was compromised, its capacity to elicit potent and immunogenic immune responses was unaffected. When delivered intranasally, it was capable of inducing mucosal and systemic immune responses. The vaccine was shown to elicit effector memory, central memory, and IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells. It also attracted neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes to the airway mucosa. Following lung infection by ExoU-producing PAO1 and PA14 strains, the survival of mice was significantly increased. Protection was conferred to almost one-third of the mice infected with XDR high-risk clone ST235. [203](#B203-vaccines-11-01264)]. [204](#B204-vaccines-11-01264)]. [205](#B205-vaccines-11-01264)]. [176](#B176-vaccines-11-01264)]. The sample size of the study consisted of 800 patients between the ages of 18 to 80 years who were predicted to require mechanical ventilation for less than 48 h. The participants were randomized to receive two doses of either 100 g of the IC43 vaccine or a saline placebo, spaced seven days apart. Safety and immunogenicity were also evaluated, showing that the rise in geometric mean OprF/I titers was 1.5-fold after the first vaccination, 20-fold at day 28, and decreased to 2.9-fold at day 180. Additionally, there was no discernible difference between the two groups in terms of overall survival or the percentage of patients with only one confirmed invasive P. aeruginosa infection or respiratory tract infection. It was shown that the IC43 100 g vaccine was well tolerated in this sizable group of critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients, Although the vaccine had a significant level of immunogenicity, it had no therapeutic advantage over a placebo in terms of overall mortality [ [206](#B206-vaccines-11-01264)]. [207](#B207-vaccines-11-01264)]. The findings indicated that only mice vaccinated with PopB/PcrH, either alone or in combination with OprF/I, exhibited a Th17 recall response from splenocytes after vaccination. Furthermore, mice that received the combination vaccine were better protected against acute lethal P. aeruginosa, regardless of the vaccination route, compared to those who received either vaccine alone or an adjuvant control. The vaccination also induced IgG titers against the vaccine proteins and whole P. aeruginosa cells. Interestingly, none of the antisera exhibited opsonophagocytic killing activity. However, antisera from mice vaccinated with vaccines containing OprF/I had the ability to block IFN- binding to OprF/I but exerted no protection. Thus, vaccines that combined PopB/PcrH with OprF/I and generated functional antibodies were able to offer broad and potent protection against P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection [ [207](#B207-vaccines-11-01264)]. [208](#B208-vaccines-11-01264)]. The vaccine candidate included PopB and outer membrane protein F and I (OprF/OprI) joined together using linkers. The multi-epitope vaccine, containing helper lymphocyte (HTL), cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), interferon gamma (IFN-), and interleukin 4 (IL-4) epitopes, was developed after performing thorough immunoinformatics analysis. This was followed by an evaluation of the physicochemical properties, allergenicity, toxicity, and antigenicity. After examination of the secondary structure, a 3D model of the tertiary structure was created, improved upon, and confirmed using computational techniques. Additionally, molecular docking and dynamics were used to determine the vaccine candidate's stability and strong protein-ligand interaction with TLR4. Additionally, pET-22b (+) was utilized in conjunction with in silico cloning to obtain optimum translation efficiency. The results showed that the chimeric vaccine had high thermostability and appropriate physicochemical properties. In particular, this vaccine candidate had a stable protein and TLR4 interaction and was sufficiently overexpressed in E. coli. It was also nontoxic and highly soluble. Overall, it might stimulate the immune system and suppress P. aeruginosa [ [208](#B208-vaccines-11-01264)]. [209](#B209-vaccines-11-01264)]. In order to create linear B cell, cytotoxic T cell, and helper T cell peptide-based vaccine constructs, the researchers carried out a computational analysis to investigate OprF and OprI, two of the key membrane proteins of P. aeruginosa. Twelve T cell peptides and two B cell peptides were predicted using various immunoinformatics databases, such as ABCpred ( [http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/abcpred/](http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/abcpred/), accessed on 14 July 2023) and the online server IEDB immune epitope database ( [https://www.iedb.org/](https://www.iedb.org/), accessed on 14 July 2023). To create a high-quality three-dimensional structure of the final vaccine design, which contained epitopes, adjuvants, and linkers, simulations were used. The vaccine was shown to have the best biophysical features, including being nonallergenic, antigenic, soluble, and non-toxic. Protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a robust and sustained interaction between the vaccine and TLR4 [ [209](#B209-vaccines-11-01264)]. [210](#B210-vaccines-11-01264)]. The chosen vaccine target was immunogenic fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) of P. aeruginosa. Potential B and T cell epitopes were predicted using the B cell prediction method ( [http://tools.iedb.org/main/bcell/](http://tools.iedb.org/main/bcell/), accessed on 14 July 2023) while T cell epitopes were predicted using IEDB MHC I ( [http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/](http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/), accessed on 14 July 2023) and MHC II ( [http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/](http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/), accessed on 14 July 2023) tools. Four of the MHC II epitopes and six of the MHC I epitopes from the data were reported to be promising. MHC I and MHC II are reported to share 19 epitopes. The epitopes had a global coverage of 95.62% of the world's population. The researchers concluded that further in vivo and in vitro tests would need to be carried out to validate the vaccine's efficacy [ [210](#B210-vaccines-11-01264)]. [211](#B211-vaccines-11-01264)]. Fap proteins are viable therapeutic targets because of their extracellular accessibility, conservation among P. aeruginosa isolates, and relationship to the phenotype of lung infections in CF patients. Furthermore, bacterial amyloid is an option for treatment due to its documented impact on the immune response and neural function. The Fap C protein and its direct interactions were investigated to identify antigenic T cell and B cell epitopes. Epitopes and peptide adjuvants have been associated with the development of vaccination candidate structures. The vaccine candidates were validated for stability, interactions with TLRs and MHC alleles, allergenicity, physiochemical characteristics, antigenicity, and stability. Immunosimulation studies have shown that the vaccines induced a Th1-dominated response, which can help improve the prognosis of CF patients after infection [ [211](#B211-vaccines-11-01264)]. 5.12. S. aureus [212](#B212-vaccines-11-01264)]. Its MDR phenotype makes it one of the most difficult pathogenic bacteria to treat, in addition to its capacity to evade the immune system. Almost all antibiotics developed since the 1940s have become obsolete for the treatment of S. aureus infections. The first methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was discovered in clinical isolates of S. aureus in 1961. Then, MRSA, a multi-resistant hospital disease, spread globally at an alarmingly accelerated rate. The MRSA strain Mu50, which was associated with diminished sensitivity to vancomycin, was discovered in 1997. According to the CLSI criteria, the S. aureus strain known as vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) resulted from an adaptive mutation against vancomycin, which has long been the last line of defense against MRSA infection [ [213](#B213-vaccines-11-01264)]. Considering the rapid emergence of MRSA strains showing resistance towards vancomycin, the development of safe and immunogenic vaccines for S. aureus is highly warranted. Despite this, there are no licensed vaccines against S. aureus. While previous research on vaccine development against S. aureus has focused on single antigen preparations, contemporary attempts prioritize the incorporation of several (Als3p), which is the N-terminal component of the experimental vaccine NDV-3, was prepared with aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). C. albicans and S. aureus cell surface proteins and Als3p share structural and sequence similarities. Consequently, both C. albicans and S. aureus infections may respond well to the NDV-3 vaccine. In the USA, NovaDigm Therapeutics finished a phase II trial for vulvovaginal candidiasis in 2016 [ [218](#B218-vaccines-11-01264)]. [212](#B212-vaccines-11-01264)]. [212](#B212-vaccines-11-01264)]. [189](#B189-vaccines-11-01264)]. The vaccine candidates in clinical development against major bacterial pathogens are summarized in [Table 2](#vaccines-11-01264-t002). 6. Conclusions [246](#B246-vaccines-11-01264)]. This method involves vaccinating against conserved and immunogenic epitopes and antigenic determinants of the bacteria. In particular, the strategy of in silico integration of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics may be used to identify conserved and immunogenic epitopes that could be incorporated into next-generation multi-epitope vaccines such as recombinant protein, DNA, or mRNA vaccines [ [247](#B247-vaccines-11-01264), [248](#B248-vaccines-11-01264)]. These vaccines are amenable to accelerated developmental timelines and can quickly progress to the clinical stage in order to curb the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Thus, next-generation vaccines offer a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness and safety of vaccine candidates, ultimately contributing to improved global health outcomes.
