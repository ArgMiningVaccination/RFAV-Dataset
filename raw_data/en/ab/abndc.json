Demographic characteristics and health status varied across these groups. Wafa Tarazi, W. Pete Welch, Nguyen Nguyen, Arielle Bosworth, Steven Sheingold, Nancy De Lew, and Benjamin D. Sommers KEY POINTS In 2019, nearly 63 million beneficiaries were enrolled in one or more Parts of the Medicare program. Of the se beneficiaries , most were enrolled in fee-for service ( FFS) Part A or B coverage (62.3 percent) , with a growing share (37.0 percent) enrolled in Medicare Advantage ( MA, or Part C coverage ). MA enrollees were disproportionally lower -income, Black or Latino, and dually enrolled in Medicaid . 7.5 percent of beneficiaries were enrolled in Part A only , which includes people 65 and over who are still employed and may be covered by employer sponsored insurance (ESI) . White beneficiaries and those with higher incomes and college education are disproportionately represented in those who are enrolled in Part A only . A very small percentage of beneficiaries, 0.4 percent , were enrolled in Part B only . Most beneficiaries with both Parts A and B coverage had supplemental coverage - either through self-purchased plans ( 32.9 percent of FFS beneficiaries), ESI ( 27.4 percent), Medicaid ( 17.6 percent), or other supplement al cover age. Nearly 16 percent of beneficiaries had no supplement . About 74.4 percent of beneficiaries were enrolled in Part D, 2.9 percent were enrolled in the Retiree Drug Subsidy program , and 13.4 percent had private drug coverage. About half of Part D enrollee s were enrolled in standalone Part D plans and about half in MA Prescription Drug plans, with similar characteristics of beneficiaries in both groups. 9.1 percent o f Medicare beneficiaries did not have drug coverage. Beneficiaries in this group were more likely to have lower income s, have less than a college degree , be unmarried, and have multiple health conditions , compared to beneficiaries with private drug coverage. Understanding the demographic characteristics and medical conditions of Medicare b eneficiaries enrolled in the four different Parts of Medicare can help policymakers better address their needs. March 2 , 2022 March 2022 ISSUE BRIEF 2 BACKGROUND Medicare serves nearly 63 million beneficiaries, providing critical access to health care services and financial security for the nation's seniors , people with disabilities , and people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in Parts A, B, C, and D w hich cover different services as described below. The four \"Parts\" of Medicare are a result of statutory changes to the program over the years. Medicare started in 1965 with eligibility requirements that are different for Parts A and B. Part A covers i npatient services at providers including hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health, and hospice services. Part B covers professional, outpatient hospital, lab, and other ambulatory services. If a person works at least 40 quarters and pays the Hosp ital Insurance payroll tax into the Part A trust fund, they become entitled to Part A without paying a premium upon reaching age 65. In contrast, Part B is voluntary; eligibility is based on turning age 65 . Part B e nrollees must pay a premium , which on ave rage covers a quarter of Part B spending . People younger than 65 may become eligible for Medicare two years after receiving Social Security disability benefits. Most beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare fee -for-service (FFS) , sometimes called \"original \" or \"traditional \" Medicare, while a growing share is enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) , or Medicare Part C , which offers private plan option s. Medicare beneficiaries can choose their Medicare coverage: FFS (Part A \"hospital insurance ,\" Part B \"medical insurance ,\" or both ), or Part C (MA) for those enrolled in both Part s A and Part B. Beneficiaries in the traditional program can also obtain supplemental coverage from several possible sources, which provide additional coverage for out -of-pocket expenses. Starting in 2006, Medicare added voluntary drug coverage - Part D - that beneficiaries can receive if they choose to enroll in a Medicare drug coverage plan. Part D coverage , like Part B, is also voluntary and generally requires a premiu m payment by beneficiaries. Beneficiaries who opt not to enroll in Part B or Part D when first eligible to do so must pay a higher premium for the rest of their lives if they enroll at a later date. Those in FFS can choose a freestanding M edicare Prescript ion Drug Plan (PDP) while those in M edicare Advantage can receive their drug coverage through their MA plan that also offers prescription drug coverage (MA -PD). In addition, t he Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 encoura ges employers to continue to offer prescription drug benefits to their Medicare -eligible retirees* through the retiree drug subsidy (RDS) program.1 Employers participating in this program must offer drug benefits that are actuarial ly equivalent to, or more generous than, PDP coverage . The different Parts of Medicare mean that there is a variation in the coverage of health services across beneficiaries, with some beneficiaries having all available coverage while others have only one type of coverage. A number of beneficiaries do not have coverage for their drugs under Part D or another source of health insurance coverage. Enrollment in the different Parts of Medicare has changed over time. During the last decade, enrollment in MA plans more than doubled .2 In 202 0, approximately 2 5.1 million beneficiaries (4 0.0 percent of Medicare beneficiari es) were enrolled in MA plans.3 This percent increased to 4 3.6 in 2021 and is projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to become 5 5.1 percent by 2030.4,5 The purpose of this Issue Brief is to analyze the most recently available Medicare administrative and survey data to paint a detailed profile of Medicare enrollees across the program's four Parts. ____________ ___________ * Medicare -eligible retirees are d efined as individuals who are entitled to Medicare benefits under Part A and/or are enrolled in Part B, and who live in the service area of a Part D plan These percentages include beneficiaries enrolled in either Part A or Part B. However, enrollment in MA requires enrollment in both Parts A and B. MA enrollment has grown since 2019 (the year of data used in this issue brief). March 2022 ISSUE BRIEF 3 METHODS We use d the 2019 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) linked to Medicare administrative data. The MCBS is a continuous, multipurpose survey of a nationally representative sample of the Medicare population, conducted by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).6 In addition to beneficiary demographics, the MCBS includes information on medical conditions, health insurance type , and coverage eligibility . We use d the CMS administrative data (Common Medicare Environment / Enrollment Database) as the main source of the Medicare coverage categories to capture all four Parts of Medicare ; information on supplemental coverage other than Medicare was self -reported and came from the MCBS. We also used the CMS Risk Adjustment Payment System to obtain information on the Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) score . We linked data from the survey participants to their information in the administrative data. We used the following Medicare coverage categories: Parts A and B: o FFS Part A and/or Part B, Part A only, Part B only o For those with b oth FFS Parts A and B , we assessed the presence and type of supplemental coverage based on survey self -report : self-purchased private plan , employer sponsored insurance (ESI), Medicaid, other coverage, and no -supplement. We used self -purchased private plan as a proxy for Medig ap/Medicare supplement plans.\u00a7 Part C: MA enrollment** Part D : total enrollment, Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (PDP), other PDP, or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plans , retiree drug subsidy (RDS) , private drug coverage, and no drug coverage . We identified enrollment in each Part of Medicare in 2019 and assessed the follo wing demographic characteristics from the MCBS : income as a percent of federal poverty level [FPL], reason for Medicare eligibility, age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, sex, and Medicare -Medicaid dual enrollment. The administrative data provided information on HCC scores, which were used to create number of health conditions . HCC is a diagnostic classification system that classif ies all ICD -10 diagnostic codes into Diagnostic Groups.7 Each Diagno stic Group represents a well -specified medical condition or set of conditions . Hierarchies are used to group and order clinically related CCs within the classification . In addition to examining the demographic characteristics and health conditions, we exam ined need for assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) that came from the MCBS. We applied the MCBS survey weights to estimate the total population size in each Part of Medicare. FINDINGS Most of the 62.5 M Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in FFS Part A or B (62.3 percent) and the rest were enrolled in MA / Part C (37.0 percent). Approximately 7.5 percent of beneficiaries were enrolled in Part A only , ____________ ___________ Both self -purchased and ESI inclu de specialty plans. Other coverage includes Veteran's affairs plan, Tricare plan, other public plan, and other unknown insurance plan type. No -supplement is defined as no coverage by any of these types of coverage (self -purchased, ESI, Medicaid, or other) . The survey data do not include detailed information on enrollment in either the Medicare Savings Program (MSP) or Part D Low -income Subsidy (LIS) . \u00a7 Our dataset does not have information on Medigap enrollment. In the MCBS questionnaire, self -purchased pri vate plan is defined as Medigap or private plans purchased through other sources (e.g. , Health Exchange). So , we used self-purchased private plans as a proxy for Medigap/Medicare Supplement plans. ** Beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare -Medicaid Plans (MMPs), Medicare cost plan, or the Program for All -inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) are included under Part C. Part A or B, Part A only, Part B only, Parts A & B, and Part D (PDP, other PDP) are for FFS enrollees only. MA -PD is for MA enrollees only. ADLs include bathing or showering, dressing, getting in and out of bed or a chair, walking, using the toilet, and eating. March 2022 ISSUE BRIEF 4 while only 0.4 percent were enrolle d in Part B only. About 74.4 percent of beneficiaries had Part D coverage (Table 1). Table 1.

Distribution of Medicare Beneficiaries in 2019 , by Program Part (Millions) Notes: Analysis of the 2019 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) linked to Medicare administrative data. Total Medicare beneficiaries included FFS Part A and B, Medicare Advantage, and a small percentage (less than 1 percent) of beneficiaries wh o were reported as deceased more than a month before their MCBS interview date (a proxy was uti lized during the interview). Table 2 presents characteristics of Medicare beneficiaries by program Part. Overall, the majority (86.2 percent) of Medicare beneficiaries were 65 or older. About 76.0 percent of beneficiaries were White non-Latino , and 52.1 percent reported that they had attended college. 15.4 percent of beneficiaries reported incomes below 100% FPL, and 16.8 percent were dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. In terms of health and functional status , 16.6 percent reported needing assistance with at least one or two ADLs, and 27.9 percent had multiple health conditions . Overall, Medicare beneficiaries are disproportionately White, older , and have lower incomes and lower levels of education compared to the U.S. population. Compared to beneficiaries enrolled in both Part A and Part B,\u00a7\u00a7 beneficiaries enrolled in MA were more likely to report incomes below 100% FPL (17.6 percent vs. 1 4.6 percent), be 75 or older (39.6 percent vs. 3 7.5 percent), and ha ve educational attainment less than high school (17.5 percent vs. 1 2.3 percent). MA inclu ded a higher percent of Black and Latino beneficiaries (13.7 percent and 10.6 percent) than in FFS Part s A and B (8.5 percent and 5. 2 percent , respectively ). MA enrollees were more likely than FFS enrollees to be dually enrolled (20.1 percent vs. 1 6.5 perc ent) and to have multiple health conditions (34.2 percent vs. 2 5.4 percent). Compared to the overall Medicare population , beneficiaries only enrolled in Part A were more likely to be younger than 75, have higher income s, and have attended college; they were less likely to be dually enrolled, have multiple health conditions, or functional limitations. Beneficiaries enrolled in Part B only were more likely to be dually enrolled, have lower incomes, and have health conditions and functional limitations comp ared to all Medicare beneficiaries. In the Discussion section, we explore what pathways commonly lead beneficiaries to be enrolled in either just Part A or just Part B. ____________ ___________ \u00a7\u00a7 Characteristics of beneficiaries enrolled in both Parts A and B are presented in Table 3. 62.5 39.0 34.0 4.7 0.323.146.5 010203040506070 Total Medicare EnrolleesFFS Part A and/or Part BBoth FFS Parts A and BPart A only Part B only Medicare Advantage (Part C)Part DCount in millions Medicare ProgramsMarch 2022 ISSUE BRIEF 6 Table 2.

HCC scores are Hierarchical Condition Category scores. The sample of total Medicare beneficiaries had 1.7% unknown education, 0.1% unknow n marital status, and 6.6% unknown ADLs count. Table 3 presents characteristics of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both FFS Part s A and B , by type of self- reported supplemental coverage . Most beneficiaries with both Parts A and B coverage reported having supplemental coverage - either through self-purchased plans ( 32.9 percent), ESI ( 27.4 percent), Medicaid ( 17.6 percent), or other supplement (6.2 percent) . In this analysis, self-purchased private plan is used as a proxy for Medigap/Medicare supplement plans . Nearly 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both Parts A and B had no supplement. Notably, nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries with no supplemental coverage had incomes above 200% FPL. Beneficiaries with a self -purchased private plan or ESI were more likely to report higher income s, be White non-Latino , and ha ve attended college; they were less likely to be dually enrolled or have multiple health conditions or functional limitations . Beneficiaries with Medicaid or no supplement al coverage were more likely to be Black, covered by Medicare based on disability, and have functional limitations. In addition, those with Medicaid coverage were more likely to be Latin o. A small share of those reported Medicaid coverage in the MCBS did not in fact have Medicaid based on administrative data.

Self -purchased private plan is a proxy for Medigap/Medicare supplement plans and includ es self-purchased specialty plans . ESI is employer sponsor ed insurance, including ESI specialty plans. Other coverage includes Veteran's affairs plan, Tricare plan, other public plan, an d other unknown insurance plan type. Some beneficiaries in the \"other\" group are facility residents with an ESI or a self -purcha sed plan. MCBS facility interviews are conducted with facility staff, rather than beneficiaries themselves. While staff members know whether a beneficiary is covered by a private plan, they may not know whether coverage is obtained through employment or se lf-purchase. Therefore, their responses are reported as \"other\". No-supplement is defined as no coverage by any of these types of coverage (self - purchased, ESI, Medicaid, or other). HCC scores are Hierarchical Condition Category scores. The sample of total Medicare Part A and B enrollees had 1.8% unknown education, 0.1% unknown marital status, and 6.9% unknown ADLs count. March 2022 ISSUE BRIEF 9 Table 4 presents characteristics of beneficiaries by drug coverage . There were 46.5 M beneficiaries (74.4 percent) enrolled in Part D, 1.8M (2.9 percent) enrolled in the retiree drug subsidy program, and 8.4M (1 3.4 percent) had private drug coverage. Overall, beneficiaries enrolled in PDP and MA -PD plans had similar characteristics. However, beneficiarie s enrolled in MA -PD plan s were more likely to be Black or Latino and ha ve multiple health conditions . 5.7M beneficiaries ( 9.1 percent) had no drug coverage at all. Beneficiaries in this group were more likely to have lower income s, have less than a college degree, be unmarried, and have multiple health conditions, compared to beneficiaries with private drug coverage.

March 2022 2019 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) linked to Medicare administrative data. PDP is Medicare prescription drug plan, and MA -PD is Medicare Advantage prescription drug plan. HCC scores are Hierarchical Condition Category scores. The sample of total Medicare Part D enrollees had 1.9% unknown education, 0.1% unknown marital status, and 6.5% unknown ADLs count. DISCUSSIO N Of the 62.5 million beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare in 2019 , approximately 39 million (62. 3 percent) had FFS Part A or B coverage and 23.1 million (37 .0 percent) had MA coverage . Enrollment in MA has been increasing over time and was 43.6 percent in 2021 , this number is expected to continue to grow .3,4 MA enrollees were more likely than FFS enrollees to be Black or Latino and were also disproportionally lower -income, dually enrolled, and had a higher number of health conditions. However, this worse apparent health status among MA beneficiaries likely reflect s at least in part higher rates of coding health conditions in MA data compared to FFS data (\"coding intensity \").8 Approximately 4.7 million beneficiaries ( 7.5 percent ) were enrolled in Part A only , while only 260,000 beneficiaries (0.4 percent) were enroll ed in Part B only . Beneficiaries only enrolled in Part A were disproportionately higher income, White, college -educated, without Medicaid coverage, and in better health. One common population enrolled only in Part A is individuals who continue to work after turning 65. If these individuals have ESI, that would generally be the primary payer ; since the se employees will not be required to March 2022 ISSUE BRIEF 11 pay premiums for Part A coverage, they enroll in Part A only until they lose their ESI upon retirement. Consistent with th is explanation, the percentage of aged enrollees who have only Part A declines with age. Beneficiaries with only Part B are all older than 65 and generally have not worked enough quarters in the U.S. to be eligible for subsidized Part A coverage . If the se beneficiaries chose to enroll in Part A, they would have to pay $471 per month ($5,652 per year) in 2021.9 One population enrolled only in Part B are individuals who immigrated to the U.S. late in their working career or after retirement . After five years of legal permanent residenc e (i.e., \"green card\") in the U.S., they are eligible to enroll in Part B like U.S. citizens 65 and older , but may find Part A premiums unaffordable . Most beneficiaries with both Parts A and B coverage (nearly half of total beneficiaries) had supplemental coverage through self -purchased plans, ESI, Medicaid, or another supplement, while nearly 9 percent had no supplement. Beneficiaries with a self -purch ased private plan or ESI were more likely to report higher incomes, be White, and have attended college; they were less likely to be dually enrolled or have multiple health conditions or functional limitations. Beneficiaries with out any supplement al covera ge were more likely to be Black, covered by Medicare based on disability, and have functional limitations . Those without supplemental coverage can face significant cost -sharing (20 percent or more on average , especially because there isn't an out-of-pocket cap), raising important concerns about inequitable access to financial protection for these populations. Nearly half ( 2.6 million) of Medicare beneficiaries with no supplemental coverage ha d incomes above 200% FPL , which suggests cost -sharing in Medicare may present affordability challenges even in middle - income families. 46.5M (74.4 percent ) of beneficiaries had Part D coverag e. Enrollment in Part D plans roughly equally divided between PDP and MA -PD, with similar charac teristics of enrollee s in both groups. However, beneficiaries enrolled in MA Prescription Drug plan s were more likely to be Black or Latino and have multiple health conditions \u2014 which again may reflect higher MA coding intensity . Nearly 1.8M beneficiaries (2.9 percent) were covered by the retiree drug subsidy program, and 8.4M beneficiaries (1 3.4 percent) had private drug coverage . About 5.7M beneficiaries ( 9.1 percent) had no drug coverage at all. This percent is slightly lower than the projection reported by t he Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ( MedPAC ) that 12 percent of Medicare beneficiaries would have no drug coverage in 2021 ; the differences are likel y due to using alternative data sources and timeframe .10 We found that b eneficiaries who did not have any drug coverage were more likely to have lower incomes, have less than a college degree, be unmarried, and have multiple health conditions, compared to beneficiaries with private drug coverage. Medicare plays a critical role in providing health coverage and access to care for the nation's seniors and people with disabilities or end -stage renal disease. Examining the demographic characteristics and medical conditions of Medicare beneficiaries enro lled in the different Parts of Medicare is important to identify ing these groups and better address ing their needs. ____________ ___________ Among 65 -year -olds in 2020, 22% of benefici aries had only Part A (or only Part B). This percentage falls to 10% for 70 -year -olds and 4% for 80 -year -olds. Source: ASPE 's analysis of data with 100% of Medicare enrollment. March 2022 ISSUE BRIEF 12 REFERENCES 1.
