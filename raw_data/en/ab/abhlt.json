About the size of a pea, the pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain in both men and women.

If the pituitary gland is not functioning properly, the proper release of hormones can be disrupted, impacting the body's ability to function. Do Male Sex Hormones Impact Sexual Function? Male sex hormones, especially testosterone, can impact a man's ability to perform and his desire to do so. However, these aren't the only side effects of a hormone imbalance. According to a research article published in the [Journal of advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255409/): ...testosterone is not just a sex hormone. There is an important research being published to demonstrate that testosterone may have key actions on metabolism, on the vasculature, and on brain function, in addition to its well-known effects on bone and body composition. Can Testosterone Treatments Help with Type 2 Diabetes? A 2018 meta-analysis published in Endocrine Connections [\"suggests that higher testosterone level can significantly decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes in men.\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793809/) By treating low testosterone, men suffering from Type 2 Diabetes can experience improvement and even (in some cases) remission of their Type 2 Diabetes. Does Low T Cause Sleep Apnea? Symptom reports from patients indicate a link between men who suffer from Low T and those who experience sleep apnea. However, further research doesn't show a clear link between the two. In a 2020 research article, ['Obstructive sleep apnea is not an independent determinant of testosterone in men,' published in the European Journal of Endocrinology](https://eje.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eje/183/1/EJE-19-0978.xml), researchers found that obesity is more closely tied to Low T. Furthermore, they reported that managing obesity in men with low testosterone could have a positive effect on sleep apnea. Is a Blood Test Required to Diagnose Low Testosterone? While a variety of symptoms can point to a testosterone imbalance, the only concrete way to diagnose Low T is through a blood test. [A research study published in The Journal of Urology defined the 'normal' levels of testosterone.](https://medicine.umich.edu/sites/default/files/content/downloads/What%20Is%20a%20Normal%20Testosterone%20Level%20for%20Young%20Men%20Rethinking%20the%20300%20ngdL%20Cutoff%20for%20Testosterone%20Deficiency%20in%20Men%2020-44%20Years%20Old.pdf) The study also identified the need to rethink these levels and the cutoff for testosterone deficiency. Even minor deficiencies can have a significant impact on a person's overall well-being.
