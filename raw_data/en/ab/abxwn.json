It is a well-established medical device company that started over 35 years ago and currently operates in 45 countries around the world. Rayonex represents Bioresonance according to Paul Schmidt, a cause-oriented treatment approach, that is named after the company founder and engineer Paul Schmidt. Rayonex Biomedical GmbH is certified to develop, produce and distribute medical devices according to DIN EN ISO 13485:2016 and is audited and certified on a yearly basis. Rayonex manufactures two medical devices: the high-end medical device, the Rayocomp PS 1000 polar 4.0 med., which can be used as a stationary device in a clinic setting, and the portable Rayocomp PS 10 med., which is primarily for patients receiving therapy at home. Due to the regulatory requirements for active medical devices, which applies to both of the Rayonex Rayocomp devices, a clinical evaluation must be carried out to prove the safety and effectiveness of the device. To this end, Rayonex Biomedical GmbH recently successfully completed a new clinical prospective, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study on the Cervical Spine Syndrome. In total, 52 patients participated in the study. All study participants received 10 treatment sessions with a compact program within a period of 70 days. This scientific study proves to patients and therapists alike that bioresonance according to Paul Schmidt is both safe and effective to use. The new study is the highest accolade the company has received in its 38 years of history and a great confirmation of our work so far. And for people who are new to the Rayonex system, the study now guarantees that Bioresonance According to Paul Schmidt is a proven, effective and safe method at the highest scientific level. We believe that the study will help to increase the acceptance of Bioresonance according to Paul Schmidt in the established medical field, which so far has neither accepted nor recognized the effect of bioenergetic vibrations to date.

The short and direct answer to this question is a resounding NO, do not have your children's teeth extracted in order to make room for other teeth. For those with a crowded mouth, and teeth that are subsequently crooked as a result it is often suggested, but instead the orthodontist or dentist should focus on stimulating the growth of the jaws themselves so that there is sufficient space for the teeth to erupt in a natural manner. This is requires a holistic approach, which recognizes that it is not just about the teeth themselves, but also the jaws (the palate), tongue, cheeks and lips that have an association with aligning teeth and maintaining equilibrium and anatomical harmony within the mouth. Invariably with crowded teeth, the jaws themselves are too small for the teeth, and not the teeth being too big for the mouth as patients often believe. This deficiency is a result of evolution; our ancestors chewed on nutrient rich, hard food compared to the relatively soft food of modern times. Today's food hardly places any demands on the palate to expand and grow as it did with our ancestors. Further, as can be the case with many children with crowded palates that regularly sleep with their mouths open, they will not have an optimum level of oxygen intake, which can have a bearing on their brain development. Another problem in my opinion is relapse; this is the most prevalent problem to overcome following modern orthodontic treatment. The teeth otherwise, will progressively shift back to where they were originally because there was simply not a holistic plan in place in the first instance. In order to prevent or reverse the growth deficiency of the jaws, we need to get creative. Removing teeth will only inhibit their growth allowing for a continued narrow palate. The problem thus worsens instead of improving. In order to impact on the growth of the jaws including the palate, we need to intervene progressively and gently and at an early age. Example of an extracted tooth due to external root resorption Gentle movement is key here as one unexpected outcome from a tooth being moved too quickly in a crowded jaw can be that the root starts resorbing (also known as external resorption). There are times however when removing teeth is inevitable and a last resort with more complex orthodontics. Removal of the relevant tooth, followed by thorough cleaning of the socket with Ozone insufflation minimizes problems in the future. At Munro Hall Clinic we adopt these protocols, and go further by placing PRGF clots to allow for optimal healing. We are contemplating adding laser as an adjunct to support the disinfection aspect. More on this topic in a different article!

In stark contrast with land grown foods, they provide comprehensive micronutrients which are insufficient or absent in the average daily diet. Seagreens\u00ae is the leading producer of our native wild species exclusively for human nutrition and a founding member of the Seaweed Health Foundation. Their high standard of production ensures a consistent nutritional profile, crucial for efficacy in nutritional therapy. A series of independent nutrition research studies from 2008-14 established important benefits in digestion, metabolic disorders, thyroid function and potentially in diabetes. Moreover, two independent reviews of international seaweed nutrition research over the past quarter century, published in 2015 and 2017, supported Seagreens' findings and concluded that a very small daily amount of seaweed (in single digit grams) of high nutritional quality \"may help ameliorate numerous risk factors associated with diabetes, obesity, endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and human cognitive disorders inclluding dementia, depression and bipolar diseases\". Native wild species Fucus vesiculosus (Bladder wrack) - Flat Fronds \u00a9 Courtesy Seagreens Trust library It can at least be summarised that Seagreens\u00ae wild wrack species provide nutrient dense, mineral rich food ingredients easily included in normal everyday foods, which can reduce the glycemic response to carbohydrate load, assist in the digestion of fats, reduce hunger via prolonged gastric emptying with a positive effect on weight regulation and nutrition, are effective prebiotics, high antioxidant free-radical scavengers in the gut and help protect the gut lining. They are an unparalleled source of soluble minerals and trace elements and deliver iodine sufficiency with no adverse effect on the thyroid. Seagreens has prepared a concise online guide to seaweed nutrition for healthcare professionals and those in training to deliver healthcare to others or themselves.

The ACZ Nano formula was born out of the need for highly effective detoxification agent to meet a demanding list of criteria. These are: - Oral administration; - Rapid absorption into the bloodstream; - Selectively binds toxic heavy metals and free radicals of all types, such as Mercury and Lead; - Irreversibly binds toxic heavy metals and free radicals of all types; - Does not bind nutrient metals such as Calcium, Magnesium, etc.; - Immediate, profound benefit; Safe for long term use; - Backed by independent research. ACZ Nano is a natural volcanic ash that mechanically binds the metals into its cage-like structure. It has been cleaned with a proprietary process 4 times to remove any contamination and independent testing shows it to have below detectable levels any contamination. It has also been pretreated with calcium, magnesium and potassium and will give these important nutrients to the body as part of the detox process. ACZ Nano is the only Zeolite on the market with over 20 independent post provocation studies to prove how effective the ACZ Nano is in increase urinary excretion of heavy metals. In one of the studies the patient saw an immediate 1000-fold increase in excretion in Mercury over 12hrs of taking the spray. There is a problem with agents like DMPS, EDTA, Chlorella and Cilantro in that some of the toxins that are mobilized will then migrate to other parts of the body, which is especially bad news if they migrate and re-deposit to the brain. So one of the big advantages of ACZ Nano over these other chelating agents is that because the toxins are tightly bound to the zeolite cage none of the metals can be deposited in to other parts of the body. ACZ Nano is easy to take, with no taste, just spray a few times into your mouth and hold for 1 minute, it will be quickly absorbed through the oral tissues and get to work reducing the body of its toxic burden.

Research in the last decade demonstrates the powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of this tiny yet powerful molecule which offers beneficial effects as a treatment for many diseases. H2 lowers oxidative stress, a precursor to chronic inflammation, protecting your cells from damage. Unlike other antioxidants, it is more discerning of helpful v harmful free radicals, scavenging and targeting the more dangerous ones active in many diseases. One of the most toxic and highly reactive radical species hydroxyl, indiscriminately attacks our cells, damaging and killing them. By affecting cultured cells with extreme oxidative stress, researchers found that H2 can select and substantially reduce hydroxyl, protecting the cells. H2 gas can also effectively and rapidly pass through bio-membranes, reaching the centre of your cells. Molecular Hydrogen Reduces Inflammation Molecular hydrogen prevents DNA damage, helping to down regulate inflammatory cytokines that promote inflammation, reduces oxidative stress and unregulates your cells' antioxidant defences. The anti-oxidant action of molecular hydrogen may have a beneficial effect upon various diseases, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, organ injury and cancer. Ongoing research supports molecular hydrogen's role in slowing down ageing and prevention of some age-related diseases. Research also shows H2 promotes cell detoxification, increases cell hydration, and strengthens the immune system. H2 is naturally produced in the gut through fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by certain gut bacteria. Research is in its infancy; antibiotics can inhibit the production of H2 in the gut; innate H2 production in the colon may have anti-inflammatory effects on colitis and may also improve intestinal function, reducing food transit time, preventing constipation. Can Molecular Hydrogen Lessen our Risks of Chronic Disease? Chronic low-level inflammation can cause and advance many diseases; down-regulating inflammation might help to treating chronic illness. Molecular hydrogen may contribute to that process and warrants more attention. Interest is growing in the scientific community regarding its potential benefits in disease prevention and treatment. Research is still in its infancy; we don't yet know how far-reaching are the benefits of drinking molecular hydrogen water. A growing body of research indicates that daily consumption of hydrogen- rich water may help to improve quality of life and general wellbeing. How can You Access Hydrogen-Rich Water? There are many expensive options; we recommend the Biocera alkaline jug and filters if you want something more affordable. This stands out from regular filters and transforms tap water into alkaline, mineral-dense, hydrogen-rich water. You can also make your own H2 water using molecular hydrogen tablets. These combine a form of elemental magnesium and an organic acid which releases the bonds of H2O after mixing with water, resulting in millions of tiny hydrogen gas-filled bubbles. HydroTab is a blend of pure magnesium and malic acid with the highest concentration of molecular hydrogen available - ten parts per million, in 500ml of water. It is more effective at producing hydrogen-rich water than a high-end electronic ionizer. These tablets create high concentrations of H2 water ready to drink in two minutes.

Sayer Complementary Health - Homeopathy has Come into its Own Homeopathy is a wonderful subject to study. It challenges much of your understanding of what dis-ease is and how it can be helped naturally with the aid of homeopathic remedies. [https://www.homeopathinessex.co.uk/phdi/p1.nsf/supppages/1240?opendocument&part=2](https://www.homeopathinessex.co.uk/phdi/p1.nsf/supppages/1240?opendocument&part=2) During the past year we have all experienced times of uncertainty coupled with disbelief that the health of so many people have been affected. I am also hearing from my clients and friends that they are experiencing feelings of sadness, anger, frustration and loneliness at being unable to meet friends and relatives for such a long period of time. At times like this homeopathy comes into its own. There are numerous remedies available in the homeopathic 'toolkit' that an experienced homeopath can draw on to ease some of the emotional issues listed above. While deep seated feelings and chronic conditions are the remit of an experienced homeopathic practitioner, my introductory course, At Home with Homeopathy is designed to help you deal with acute situations that you and/or your family might experience. The course gives you an insight into the background of this fascinating method of alternative medicine and how you can use the remedies for minor ailments such as headaches, coughs, colds, tummy upsets, etc. The beauty of homeopathic remedies is that they are non-toxic and non-addictive, safe for all ages and can be very useful in speeding up the recovery process. For anyone who wishes to delve more deeply into homeopathy and take it up as a profession, I offer the Homeopathic Practitioner Diploma course an in-depth apprenticeship style course spread over three years. Working with people who wish to achieve better health, alongside homeopathy I offer nutritional support advising on supplementation and nutritional support programmes such as the NutriClean Programme, Gut Transformation and Perimenopause Programme. I am passionate about helping people to achieve and maintain a better state of health with the aid of homeopathy and nutrition and currently I am offering consultations via Zoom until such time as we may be able to meet in person again at my practice in Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex. Should you be interested in how homeopathy can help you or you are interested in learning more about this non-addictive, non-toxic natural form of medicine that has been in existence for over 250 years, I would be very happy to talk to you.

Hardback \u00a316.00 / $24.95. ISBN 9781603587488. Using herbal medicines to heal the body is an ancient practice, but in the twenty-first century, it is also a worldwide industry: In 2019, consumers spent over $9 billion on herbal supplements. Yet most consumers know very little about where those herbs come from and how they are processed into the many products that fill store shelves. [https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/the-business-of-botanicals/](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/the-business-of-botanicals/) Author Ann Armbrecht, director of the Sustainable Herbs Program of the American Botanical Council, reveals the inner workings of a complicated industry, with players that range from small farms where herbs are harvested by hand, to wild collectors who gather herbs using traditional practices, to industrial production fields where herbs are harvested by combines. Her investigation brings up questions about whether the health benefits of medicinal herbs can be preserved when production expands to an industrial scale. Armbrecht shares stories from the people and places she visits around the world, including: - A massive industrial facility in New Jersey that produces herbal supplements on a factory floor the size of a soccer field - A mid-scale herb processing company in Poland struggling to implement rigorous fair-trade certification standards - A mission-driven farm in Vermont building a network of herbalists committed to buying certified organic and domestically grown herbs for their products - An ecologically conscious herb company working to protect endangered hornbills in India by creating a market for the fruit of the bibhitaki trees in which they nest The Business of Botanicals is the first book to explore the interconnected web of the global herb industry and its many stakeholders, and will be an invaluable resource for consumers who want to better understand the safety and efficacy of the products they buy. About the Author Ann Armbrecht is the director of the Sustainable Herbs Program under the auspices of the American Botanical Council. She is also a writer and anthropologist (PhD, Harvard 1995) whose work explores the relationships between humans and the earth, most recently through her work with plants and plant medicine.
