Having already obtained my Pneumonia injections, I thought I was well prepared for the forthcoming Influenza Season since, according to medical science, the vaccination was to assist in making me immune to the virus. Having taken care of the medical responsibilities, I proceeded to prepare my \"Spiritual Immune System.\" (See \" [Are You Building Your Spiritual Immune System?](http://www.everydayhomemaker.com/the-art-of-homemaking/2018/12/21/are-you-building-your-spiritual-immune-system)\" December 2018 Post). Then, I began hearing rumblings about a new virus that had no immunization and was quickly moving from a concern to a pandemic. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, I knew that I needed a spiritual immunization for it if I wanted to remain spiritually healthy. Currently, there is no immunization for COVID-19. However, upon consultation with my Great Physician, I learned that an immunization for Spiritual COVID-19 does exist. Prior to understanding the components of the immunization, I needed to analyze its characteristics. This acronym assisted me\u2014I pray that it will prove helpful to you! C\u2014Confident. A quiet confidence that our heavenly Father is always with us (Ps. 23; Isa.30:15). O\u2014Omniscience and Omnipresence. Omnipresence\u2014God being present in all places at all times (Ps. 139:1-6) and Omniscience\u2014God's knowledge of all things from the womb until the end of our sojourn on earth (Ps. 139:7-18) sustains us during challenging times. V\u2014Victor. Choosing to be a spiritual victor, regardless of our physical condition, rather than a victim. A victim is an individual who suffers from a destructive or injurious action and is deceived or cheated. A victor is a person who has overcome or defeated an adversary. Satan is our adversary, and he is essentially seeking opportunities to overwhelm us (1 Peter 5:8-9). If we succumb to his ploys, we become victims. If we resist him and trust our heavenly Father, we are victors. When we make the choice to submit to God, we are taking a stand against Satan, moving us from victim to victor status (James 4:7). I\u2014Incline. Incline our hearts to our heavenly Father (Josh. 24:23). The spiritual heart is the center of thinking and reason (Prov. 3:3, 6:21, 7:3), the emotions (Prov. 15:15, 30) and the will (Prov. 11:20). The condition of our spiritual heart determines how well the \"Spiritual COVID-19 Serum\" is absorbed into our bodies and ultimately determines how we react to life's circumstances. D\u2014Deeds. Choosing to daily practice deeds that will encourage others and glorify our heavenly Father (Matt. 5:13-16; 25:31-46; Luke 6:38; Col. 3:17). 19\u2014Kelsey's Korner communicates a poignant, clear message of how to be proactive in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Before you read her recommendations, I encourage you to use the \"19 injections of the Spiritual COVID-19 Serum\" to strengthen your Spiritual Immunity. SERUM COMPONENTS OF THE SPIRITUAL COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION The 19 Injections of the Spiritual COVID-19 Serum can, when assimilated into the mind and absorbed into the heart, immunize us against Spiritual COVID-19. Second Chronicles 7:14 is the prescription for the series of injections. Proverbs 3:5-6 provides the initial mega-dose of trust that supports the absorption of the remaining 18 injections. Joshua 1:9 protects against fear. Psalm 68:19 reinforces God's daily provision. Romans 15:13 emphasizes that God is the object of our hope. Romans 12:12 is a three-fold injection that provides perspective on our attitudes. Nahum 1:7 keeps our focus on God's role in being a compassionate, mighty fortress. John 14:1 shields us from a troubled heart. Philippians 4:4 stresses that our joy is unrelated to the circumstances of life but is rather related to our unassailable, unchanging relationship with our sovereign Lord. Philippians 4:6-7 inoculates against anxiety. Psalm 103:2-5 shields against a spirit of ingratitude. Matthew 11:28 vaccinates against weariness. 2 Corinthians 4:17-18 injects a spirit of anticipation for the future. Psalm 121:1-2 infuses a strong dose of assurance. Isaiah 41:10 implants the source of spiritual strength. Psalm 118:5-9 fortifies the reality of our heavenly Father's faithfulness to us. John 16:33 bathes the heart in peace. Romans 8:38-39 safeguards our confidence in God's love. Hebrews 4:16 instills confidence in the ability of our Great Physician to meet our needs. James 1:12 insures that when we complete the entire series of injections, we will be rewarded! KELSEY'S KORNER There's absolutely no doubt about it\u2014COVID-19 has turned our world upside down. This previously unknown virus has proven itself to be incredibly contagious, spreading, despite efforts, all over the world in just months. Stores are empty as shortages prompt people to stockpile goods, much international and even domestic travel is banned, and restaurants, gatherings, and even schools are closing their doors. In the midst of this chaos, people are divided. Some view the government and public's reactions as over-the-top and unfounded, downplaying the whole situation, while others view all that's being done as not nearly enough. As Christians, our reactions are important in maintaining a good witness to the watching world, so how should we view and react to the COVID-19 pandemic? Here are a few thoughts to guide our actions: According to the CDC, people at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 are older adults and persons with underlying heath issues, like diabetes, lung disease, heart issues, etc. As a matter of fact, most healthy people who get the virus testify to very few and very mild symptoms! Knowing this, if you're young and healthy, it's tempting to not care and to criticize everyone being safe as \"overreacting\". However, our role as young people is pivotal to the protection of those who are older and weaker. Even if we ourselves could get the virus and be fine, since it is so contagious, should we become ill we are acting as receptacles of contagion, potentially infecting dozens of people, some older and weaker. And the cycle continues, the number of sick people, occupied hospital beds, and deaths rising exponentially. Not caring is in total opposition to our claim as Christians, as God Himself cares immensely for the elderly and the weak and has called us to as well (cf. Ps. 82:3-4, Is. 1:17, Prov. 14:13, Jer. 22:3). So, instead, the best practice to put into place right now is isolation, or at the very least, social distancing. Your cautiousness could literally save hundreds of thousands of lives, not to mention help save the economy from a full-blown recession! Keep this in mind as you go about your day. Right now, many of us may be overwhelmed with concerns and overcome by fears of the \"what if's\". If you find yourself ruled by fear during these uncertain times, remember God's sovereignty and care for His people. He has promised never to leave or forsake us (Heb. 13:5) and has told us that all things (even scary viruses) work together for our good and His glory (Rom. 8:28). So, seek instead to turn ungodly fears and panic into healthy concern by laying your worries before the Lord in prayer, knowing He hears your cries and cares deeply. Pray for all of the people around the world effected by this virus, both physically and financially. Pray for those who are in isolation and scared. Pray for healing for those who are sick and for those who have lost loved ones. Pray for those whose jobs rely on travel, entertainment, tourism, etc., as well as those who may not have funds to fall back on. Pray for our hospitals and their staff. Pray for our president and other leadership as they are making difficult decisions right now. Pray for the future of our economy. Pray for an end to this pandemic. And ultimately, pray that this occasion would bring many to a saving knowledge of Christ and that God would be glorified through it all! Think of ways you may be able to help. John 13:35 testifies that the watching world will know we are Christ's disciples by our love for one another. A natural outflow of our Spirit-given love for others is to seek ways to help those in need. Consider donating to global and federal agencies, like the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate)or the [foundation that supports the Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdcfoundation.org/coronavirus), and smaller organizations, such as those listed in [this article](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/money/a31467983/coronavirus-outbreak-donation-nonprofits-list/). Also, check out your local hospital's website to see if they have any needs that you may be able to assist with. If your budget is tight but you still want to help, check out [Shopping Angels](https://www.facebook.com/shoppingangelsnv/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&eid=ARAp4wgi_ar5gM1gdNp39waWE5fBrtyh0KfBv18Qx1ro65B-WJHt2kYBMEN--FhDToa8n8-_jt0KJONl), a community service effort created during the Coronavirus outbreak where people can shop for and deliver groceries to the elderly (who are more adversely affected by COVID-19). Most importantly, this scary time reminds us that earth is not our final home (Phil. 3:20). Although, as Ephesians assures us, we have received the down payment for our faith through Christ, the gift of the Holy Spirit, we are still living under the curse of the fall (Eph. 1:13-14). What will be has not yet come! So instead of clinging too tightly to the transient things around us (2 Cor. 4:18), let's loosen our grips and eagerly look forward to Christ's return where He will make ALL things right (Rev. 21:3-5)! THE EVERYDAY HOMEMAKER'S MONTHLY MEDITATION THOUGHT God's Word states, \"He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust. Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence.'\" (Ps. 91:1-3) Therefore, I may boldly say, regardless of how strongly the perilous pestilence (COVID-19) rages I dwell in an intimate place of Divine Protection because I am a child of God. Blessings on your day as you focus on making your house "}
