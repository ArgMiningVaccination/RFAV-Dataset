I enjoy the doctors as well as the staff. They have been nothing but kind and understanding to my situation. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family. S.M. 10/2022 | | Acupuncture needles are extremely fine, flexible, and are about the diameter of a human hair. They are nothing like the hypodermic needles we remember as children and no medicine is forced into the muscle. Acupuncture needles are sterile, vacuum packaged, single-use and are disposed of after use. In almost all cases, insertion by a qualified practitioner is performed with a minimum of discomfort. Most patients find acupuncture therapy very relaxing and many fall asleep during therapy. Therapy can also be tailored to patients using acupuncture styles with very shallow needle insertion. For the needle phobic patient, we can help you overcome your fear and many conditions can be well treated with Chinese Herbs only. | | Getting Acupuncture Therapy The first session will last approximately 60 -75 minutes and includes a full health history and treatment. You will lay comfortable on a massage table with relaxing music during your treatment. Most people get deeply relaxed any many feel it is \"more relaxing than a massage.\" Upon completion, a customized therapy plan will be developed. Follow up visits last around 60 minutes. The number of sessions required depends on your condition. Many can be treated in 5-12 sessions, while chronic or degenerative conditions may require tune-ups after the initial series of therapy sessions. We use only single-use, disposable needles. | | The Science of Acupuncture The 1997 NIH Consensus Statement on Acupuncture states considerable evidence exists that acupuncture: | | Eastern Philosophy TCM is based on an energetic model rather than the biochemical model of Western Medicine. The ancient Chinese recognized a vital energy, which they called Qi (pronounced \"chee\"), in all life forms and life processes. They also discovered a system of Qi circulation along specific pathways or meridians throughout the human body. Each meridian corresponds with a particular internal organ system. It is important to note here that the TCM conception of the internal organs overlaps, but does not directly correspond with our current understanding of the organs. Disease is considered the result of blocked Qi flow or imbalances in other natural states of the body impairing the optimal function of the organs and/or musculoskeletal system. The meridians, which carry the Qi, \"communicate\" with the organs and musculoskeletal system through surface points on the body called acupuncture points. Each point has a predictable effect on the qi passing through it and the associated organ. Herbal medicine and dietary and lifestyle recommendations also have predictable effects on the flow of Qi and on other natural states of the body. You might think of acupuncture, herbs and dietary and lifestyle recommendations as the tools of the TCM practitioner. | | Custom Acupuncture Therapy Treatment used to balance the flow of energy in the body, stimulate nerves, relax muscles and connective tissue.
