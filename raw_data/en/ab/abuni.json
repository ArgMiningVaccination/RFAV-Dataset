Practitioners of TCM use herbs, diet, acupuncture, cupping, gua sha, tai chi and qigong to prevent and treat health issues. While typical treatment in allopathic medicine is based on the diagnosis, in TCM, the treatment is decided by diagnosing the imbalance present. In order to be healthy, an individual's organs and their functions must be in balance. This balance is found by harmonizing yin and yang, two opposing but complementary energies thought to affect all life. This philosophy is rooted in Taoism and that all the bodies organs support each other, a sum of the parts if you will. Another theory in traditional Chinese medicine is that vital energy called \"Qi\" flows throughout the body via certain pathways known as meridians\". Pathological disease and emotional, mental, and physical health problems develop when the flow of qi is blocked, deficient, or excessive. Restoring the flow of qi is absolutely necessary to balancing the yin and yang and Qi to create a well body. Generally, appointments take about an hour where you will be assessed thru a series of questions, pulse and tongue diagnosis and a treatment protocol will be created. TCM can be used for a myriad of conditions such as arthritis, anxiety, allergies, high blood pressure, insomnia, pain, digestive issues, hormone imbalances and diabetes to name a few. "}
