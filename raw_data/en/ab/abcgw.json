The Biochemistry Profile provides information about the functioning of organs and tissues in the body. The Complete Blood Count (CBC) measures the quantity and quality of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the body. The results of these blood tests, in combination with a physical exam and your pets' medical history, are used to help diagnose disease and detect injury.
