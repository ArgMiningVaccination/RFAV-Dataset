His personal Perks, [Lethal Pursuer](/wiki/Lethal_Pursuer) [, ](/wiki/Lethal_Pursuer) [Hysteria](/wiki/Hysteria) [, and ](/wiki/Hysteria) [Eruption](/wiki/Eruption) [, allow him to quickly ambush Survivors, while sowing confusion and fear when injuring and hooking them. ](/wiki/Eruption) Difficulty Rating: Hard (These Killers use mechanics that are specific to them and require more practice to be effective) Lore Resident Evil The Nemesis is a Model T-103 Tyrant, a superhuman bio-organic weapon mass-produced by Umbrella Corporation. Unlike previous prototypes, it possessed near-human intelligence and could follow orders. It was flown into [Raccoon City](/wiki/Raccoon_City) alongside other Tyrants and ordered to eliminate any remaining members of S.T.A.R.S., including [Jill Valentine](/wiki/Jill_Valentine). The Nemesis, like all T-103 Tyrants, was infected with the [T-Virus](/wiki/T-Virus) [ during its creation.](/wiki/T-Virus) However, due the T-Virus degrading the host's brain and causing a decline in intelligence to the degree of making it impossible for the host to follow complex orders, T-103s were additionally infected with the NE- parasite which would take control of the host's body, bypassing the degrading brain and providing The Nemesis with near-human intelligence. When The Nemesis uses his tentacle, it is not actually a tentacle, but the parasite within him, as the NE- Parasite is a worm-like creature. Dead by Daylight Designed by Umbrella Corporation, The Nemesis is a nearly unstoppable bio-organic weapon fixated on pursuing and eliminating its targets. Part of the Tyrant T-103 series, this specimen has increased intelligence and awareness due to the NE- Parasite implanted within it. Its first mission unleashed it upon Racoon City, where it had a singular objective: exterminate S.T.A.R.S. members. Rampaging through the city, The Nemesis faced off against Jill Valentine multiple times, and though she managed to escape, he was never far behind. He nearly had his target, when a strange fog descended upon them, mixing with the smoke of a city in chaos. The phenomenon meant nothing to him\u2014the frigid cold and decreased oxygen never posing a threat. All that mattered was soldiering on into The Fog, continuing the mission: find S.T.A.R.S., exterminate S.T.A.R.S., and kill anyone who gets in the way. Load-out Unique Perks The Nemesis comes with 3 [Perks](/wiki/Perks) [ that are unique to him: ](/wiki/Perks) | | - At the start of the Trial, the [Auras](/wiki/Auras) [of all](/wiki/Auras) [Survivors](/wiki/Survivors) [are revealed to you for 7/8/9 seconds.](/wiki/Survivors) - Extends the duration of a Survivor's Aura being revealed to you by +2 seconds.

Weapon: Raw Fists The Raw Fists are the Primary Weapon of The Nemesis. Powerful arms to overpower targets swiftly. Power: T-Virus | | Its effects heighten aggression and strength within The Nemesis.

Contaminated Survivors will also occasionally cough. SPECIAL INTERACTION: VACCINE: Survivors can be cured from Contamination by using a [Vaccine](/wiki/Vaccine) [ on either themselves or on other Survivors. ](/wiki/Vaccine) A limited number of Vaccines can be found inside [Supply Cases](/wiki/Supply_Cases) [, 4 of which are placed randomly in the environment.](/wiki/Supply_Cases) Each Vaccine may only be used 1 time. All Supply Cases still containing their Vaccine are highlighted to Contaminated Survivors in white. Using the Vaccine briefly reveals the Survivor's location through [Killer Instinct](/wiki/Killer_Instinct). SPECIAL ENEMY: [ZOMBIES](/wiki/Zombies) T-Virus causes 2 Zombies to spawn in and roam about the Trial Grounds. The Zombies can attack Survivors when they come too close, but abide by the same conditions as a Tentacle Strike. The Nemesis can wilfully destroy a Zombie to add +1 Contamination point to his Power gauge. Destroying them using a [Basic Attack](/wiki/Basic_Attack) yields no such reward. This can be used to manually cause the Zombies to respawn in a different location in the Trial Grounds. Survivors have limited options to interact with Zombies: - Blinding them to lose [, or](/wiki/Firecrackers) [or](/wiki/Pallets) [Head On](/wiki/Head_On) [.](/wiki/Head_On) The Zombies respawn after 12 seconds if they were destroyed by The Nemesis and after 45 seconds if they were destroyed by Survivors.

Unknown Patch - Reassessed the difficulty rating from Very Hard to Hard. Trivia - The Nemesis is the first Killer to carry Survivors under his arm, rather than on his shoulder. - The Nemesis is the first Killer to feature AI-controlled minions in the form of a pair of Zombies roaming about the Trial Grounds on the hunt for Survivors. - The Nemesis is the first Killer to have Add-ons featuring quotes by Survivors. - The Nemesis is the first Killer that damages Generators using a single stomp. - The Nemesis is the second Killer to originate from another Game franchise. - The Nemesis is the fourth Killer to not attack with an actual weapon, but instead using his bare fists. - Upon The Nemesis' release, some [Windows](/wiki/Windows) [, like those in the](/wiki/Windows) [Killer Shack](/wiki/Killer_Shack), had to be slightly vertically extended to accommodate his height. - Many of the actions performed by The Nemesis take inspiration directly from his appearance in the 2020 remake of Resident Evil 3. - His walking and running animation when pursuing Survivors and after a Trial are nearly identical to how he chases down [Jill](/wiki/Jill)after their first encounter together and later pursues her throughout Raccoon City. - The way The Nemesis destroys objects and damages Survivors is nearly identical to his basic attacks including how he will punch and attempt to stomp on Jill, similar to how he damages Generators and closes the Hatch with a single stomp. - The Nemesis' Pallet breaking action in which he performs a double overhead fist slam is one of his knockdown attacks. - After striking a Survivor, The Nemesis may roar after hitting them, something he does after striking Jill with one of his many punch attacks. - When a Survivor escapes from The Nemesis' grasp, he will crouch down on one knee and place his fist to the ground, something he does when taking too much damage from Jill. - When being stunned by a Pallet, he reacts the same as to when Jill shoots him. - His Mori is a modified version of one of his two kill animations. Instead of wounding Jill with his tentacle and pulling her in, he will simply grab her by the head before throwing her to the ground and stomp on her face, similar to his Mori, however he again does not use his tentacle to pull Jill in before crushing her head. - His walking and running animation when pursuing Survivors and after a Trial are nearly identical to how he chases down Voice Trivia - The Nemesis was the third Killer to speak in Dead by Daylight. - When killing [Jill Valentine](/wiki/Jill_Valentine) [,](/wiki/Jill_Valentine) [Chris a](/wiki/Rebecca_Chambers) [Locker](/wiki/Locker) [, he says the infamous \"S.T.A.R.S.\" line from Resident Evil 3.](/wiki/Locker) - When killing Zombie Trivia - The female Zombie is voiced by Roxana B.L., the male Zombie by David A.B. - It is possible to spot the spawn Hook of one Zombie under specific circumstances. - Zombies are loaded into the Trial like Survivors, spawning them above ground at their spawn Hook. When the Trial begins, the Game teleports the Zombies below ground. Since the teleportation command is not initiated until The Nemesis' camera panning elapses, it is possible to spot an above-ground-Zombie during one's own camera panning, and, for Survivors, potentially for a second or two after theirs has elapsed, due to the fact that the camera panning is not synced across all Players. - Zombies are loaded into the Trial like Survivors, spawning them above ground at their spawn Hook.
