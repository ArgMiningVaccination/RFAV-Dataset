This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence available on the relationship between anthroposophy and vaccine beliefs. The systematic review addressed aimed to collate evidence documenting outbreaks linked to anthroposophic communities, literature on vaccination coverage in anthroposophic communities and lastly describe literature that summarizes theories and factors in\u0000uencing vaccine decision making in anthroposophic communities. Methods: This is a systematic review using following databases: Medline, Web of Science, Psycinfo and CINAHL. Article screening was conducted by two researchers. Data was summarized to address the research questions. For the third research question the qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis with the assistance of Nvivo12.0. Results: There were 12 articles documenting 18 measles outbreaks linked to anthroposophic communities between the years 2000 and 2012. Seven articles describe lower vaccination uptake in anthroposophic communities than in other communities, although one article describes that vaccination uptake in low-income communities with a migrant background have lower coverage than the anthroposophic community they studied. We found eight articles examining factors and theories in\u0000uencing vaccine decision making in anthroposophic communities. The qualitative analysis revealed four common themes. Firstly, there was a very broad spectrum of vaccine beliefs among the anthroposophic communities. Secondly, there was a consistent narrative about problems or concerns with vaccines, including toxicity, lack of trust in the system. Thirdly, there was a strong notion of the importance of making individual and well-informed choice as opposed to simply following the masses. Lastly, making vaccine choices was highly stigmatized by those outside of the anthroposophic community but also those within the community. Conclusion: Continued research and monitoring of vaccine beliefs in the anthroposophic community is important particularly in view of current COVID-19 vaccine decision debates. The importance of the Waldorf school and community context in in\u0000uencing vaccine decision making warrants further investigation. Background Vaccines save lives. Vaccine hesitancy has been considered one of the top 10 public health threats of our time (1). Understanding of vaccine beliefs and sentiments is one of the most pressing public health issues. Albeit contentious, anthroposophic groups have been identi\u0000ed as vaccine hesitant groups. This systematic review provides an overview of the existing published evidence that examines the relationship between anthroposophy and vaccines. Anthroposophy is a spiritualist movement that was established by scientist and philosopher Rudolf Steiner born in 1861 in Austria. Anthroposophy literally implies wisdom about man, and stipulates that through meditation and concentration, individuals can utilize the physical world to connect with the spiritual world (2). The spiritualist movement began in Germany in the early 20th century and led to the creation of now well-established Waldorf schools and anthroposophic medicine worldwide (2). There are over 1000 Waldorf schools (also referred to as Steiner schools) in around 60 countries around the world (2). Anthroposophic medicine was founded in the early 1920s by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman. Drawing on anthroposophic philosophy it incorporates a holistic approach to the understanding of illness and approaches toPage 3/24healing(2). Anthroposophic medicine addresses a broad spectrum of health issues (family medicine, chronic disease, pediatric disease and palliative care) and is offered in combination with mainstream medicine or in anthroposophic medical practices. It offers medicines derived from herbs, minerals and animals, eurythmy and art therapy, massage, counselling and psychotherapy(3). Anthroposophic medicine can be studied at accredited schools by medical doctors, movement and mental health therapists and nurses (2). Anthroposophic medicine is practiced in 78 countries worldwide, predominantly in Central Europe. There are circa 24 anthroposophic medical institutions - these include hospitals, departments in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and other inpatient healthcare centers in six countries (Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, The Netherlands, and the United States) (2). Moreover, there are around 180 anthroposophic outpatient clinics globally where anthroposophic physicians work in collaboration with or biomedical approaches to health care. In addition, anthroposophic physicians work in their own practices or in collaboration with other complementary health care providers(2). In Germany, Latvia and Switzerland, anthroposophical medicine is considered a distinct and special therapy. In Germany it is overseen by its own committee at the Federal Institute for drugs and medical devices. Anthroposophic medicine is popular and in some instances revealed higher patient satisfaction compared to conventional health care (2). Anthroposophic medicine and vaccination The 2019 o\u0000cial statement of the international centre of anthroposophic medicine the Medical Section of the Goetheanum, and the International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations (IVAA) clearly states that they do not support the anti-vaccine movement. Rudolf Steiner did not oppose vaccines, however, vaccination and anthroposophic medicine constitutes a somewhat contentious point (3). This is partly because Rudolf Steiner argued that childhood illnesses are important for growth and development of a child, leading some to question the necessity of vaccines (3). Consequently, anthroposophic communities have often been labelled as anti-vaxxers. Moreover, concerns have been raised by the scienti\u0000c community on the role of the anthroposophic movement in measles and rubella outbreaks over the past decade(4). The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the existing literature that investigating the relationship between anthroposophy and vaccination beliefs. The systematic review addresses three questions: 1. What are the documented outbreaks associated with low vaccination coverage in anthroposophic communities? 2. What is the evidence vaccination rates in anthroposophic communities? 3. What is the evidence that describes factors and theories for low vaccination uptake in anthroposophic communities? Methods Protocol and registration No review protocol exists and the systematic review has not been registered. Search strategy A systematic literature search was performed by two researchers in the following databases: Medline, Web of Science, Psycinfo and CINAHL. The last search was conducted 2022-09-05. The search strategy was developed in Medline (Ovid) in collaboration with librarians at the Karolinska Institutet University Library. For each search conceptPage 4/24Medical Subject Headings (MeSH-terms) and free text terms were identi\u0000ed (see appendix). No language restriction was applied. Databases were searched from inception. The strategies were peer reviewed by another librarian prior to execution. De-duplication was done using the method described by Bramer et al (5). One \u0000nal, extra step was added to compare DOIs. The full search strategies for all databases are available in the appendix. Study selection Independent study selection was completed by two reviewers (SHvW and KA). The selection was \u0000rst based on abstract and title. Discrepancies did not occur. All the reviewers discussed the \u0000ndings and consensus was reached. Quality assessment A quality assessment of the selected papers was conducted by two researchers. For the qualitative studies we used the JBI Critical Appraisal Tool for Qualitative Research (6). This is a quality control checklist. For the quantitative studies we applied the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality evaluation tool to assess the quality of all quantitative publications that were included as references in this work(7). Each article received a \u0000nal rating at the conclusion with one of the following scores: 1 (Strong), 2 (Moderate), or 3 (Weak). We then calculated the average of the results (from two reviewers), which represents the overall evaluation of the quality of all quantitative papers. The articles included received an overall score of 1.9. Analysis To address research question one and two, the data was summarized in Tables 1-3. To address research question three, the qualitative research data of the articles included in this review (Table 4) were analyzed using thematic analysis in Nvivo12. The data were imported into Nvivo12, coded and categories from the grouping of codes were created by two researchers. The creation of themes was discussed in the research team. The coding tree is presented in Table 5. Results The search revealed 28 papers (see Fig. 1). Twelve papers that address papers describing outbreaks associated to anthroposophic communities. Seven papers that describe vaccination coverage/personal belief exception rates associated with anthroposophic beliefs. Eight papers that describe factors in\u0000uencing vaccine decision making among anthroposphic communities and anthroposophic providers. Outbreaks in anthroposophic communities Table 1 describes 17 measles outbreaks measles outbreaks that occurred between 1997 and 2011 in European countries described in 12 papers (Table 2 summarizing the papers). The table describes the location, the year, of the outbreak and the number of cases, the source the outbreak and catch up strategies (where these were described). The studies show that nine out of 18 measles outbreak started at a Waldorf school. Although data from community reporting is limited, in the articles described, the measles cases at Waldorf schools are predominantly higher than in the community. The offer of measles vaccination catch up by public health authorities (which is an effective way to manage a measles outbreak) was described in several articles but largely refused by both parents and Waldorf schools. The most effective outbreak control strategy was the immediate closure of the Waldorf school and strict rules regarding entry to the school upon reopening.Page 5/24Table 2 summarizes 12 articles that describe outbreaks in Europe linked to anthroposophic communities. Eleven articles describe measles outbreaks, some of the outbreaks are mentioned in several papers. One article describes a mumps outbreak in Switzerland in the 1990s.Page 6/24Table 1 Measles outbreaks linked to anthroposophic communities Place Year Cases in anthroposophicOutbreak total nOrigin Catch-up Belgium(9)2011 41 65 Pre-school, spread to Waldorf school.Vaccination campaigns and discussion with an anthroposophic clinic.

Vaccination coverage in anthroposophic communities Table 3 summarizes six articles which describe vaccine coverage in anthroposophic communities and one article describes personal belief exception (PBE) rate at Waldorf school in the USA. The papers focus predominantly on diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and poliomyelitis (DPTP) and mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccines. Two studies focus on studying the vaccination coverage at Waldorf pre-schools/schools, demonstrating overall low immunization coverage at those schools (16, 17). One article focusing on PBE rates demonstrates a proportionally high rate at Waldorf schools in California (18). Three studies from the Netherlands measure vaccination coverage in general and focus speci\u0000cally on whether there are special groups that show speci\u0000cally low coverage (19-21). In these studies, anthroposophic groups are identi\u0000ed as showing low coverage (15-17). However, one study highlights that anthroposophic groups are not as signi\u0000cant as low-income groups (19). One paper describes rates of vaccination refusal in Switzerland(22). It highlights that complementary alternative medicine (CAM) users, including people who draw on anthroposophic medicine are more likely to refuse vaccination. However, the paper also shows that this group was more likely to vaccinate against tick borne disease and encephalitis than the general population(22).Page 11/24Table 3 Summary of articles describing factors that in\u0000uence vaccination uptake in anthroposophic communities Paper Country Year % vaccination coverage /PBE exemption ratesStudy aim & population.Key message Pfaff, G., Leher, A., Fechler, A. and Ou\u00e9draogo, N., 2017.

Factors and theories in\u0000uencing vaccine decision making in anthroposophic communities The systematic search revealed eight articles examining factors and theories in\u0000uencing vaccine decision making in anthroposophic communities (see Table 4). Five articles focused on parents of children attending Waldorf schools or considered themselves part of an anthroposophic community. Three articles focused on the perspectives on anthroposophic providers (23, 24), although some of those articles mixed and compared views with other alternative/complementary providers or allopathic health providers. Of the eight articles, two were quantitative (19, 25) and did not provide an in-depth discussion. The qualitative \u0000ndings from six articles (8, 24, 26-28) were summarized in-depth and revealed four themes (see Table 5), described in this section.Page 15/24Table 4 Summary of 8 studies addressing factors associated with vaccination decision making in anthroposophic communities Mollema L, Wijers N, HC, de Melker HE.

Three articles focused on the perspectives on anthroposophic providers (23, 24), although some of those articles mixed and compared views with other alternative/complementary providers or allopathic health providers. Of the eight articles, two were quantitative (19, 25) and did not provide an in-depth discussion. The qualitative \u0000ndings from six articles (8, 24, 26-28) were summarized in-depth and revealed four themes (see Table 5), described in this section. Broad spectrum of vaccine decisions All studies describe a broad spectrum of vaccine decisions (8, 23, 26-28). There are those who delay vaccines and the primary reason is to not overburden a young child's body (8). There are those who are positive towards some vaccines (8), for instance the tetanus vaccine appears to be accepted in several studies (27). There are also some groups who vaccinate according to need, for example, if they live on a farm they vaccinate all their children against tetanus or if they do not think they can care for their child at home they vaccinate against MMR (27). Similarly, several studies mention that parents vaccinate because there is an absence of disease and they would vaccinate their children in a setting with high risk of the disease, e.g. abroad (8, 27). Lastly, all six articles mentioned some groups in the anthroposophic community who do not vaccinate their children at all, primarily due to the belief that childhood diseases are natural, natural immunity is better than vaccines and because of concerns about vaccine content (8, 24, 26, 27). Some anthroposophic health providers share the belief that diseases and fever are good for children and that they protect from allergy (24, 28). The articles describe very little information about how vaccine decisions are made, apart from mentioning the important role and in\u0000uence of peers and the community (27). Sobo describes how some participants express authority and clear reasoning in their vaccine decision making by drawing on scienti\u0000c evidence (27). The quality of that evidence is questioned but not examined in detail.Page 19/24Consistent narrative about problems with vaccines The articles describe concerns with side effects of vaccines (8, 27-29). Some papers expressed participants' concerns with long-term side effects that may affect the brain due to aluminum found in some vaccines (28) and links to autoimmune diseases (27, 28). Some anthroposophic health providers share the same concerns about long- term effects on brain health and also add that vaccinated children are more likely to develop allergies and asthma(28). Parental concerns about toxicity and how they interfere with long-term health were mentioned (26, 27). A common argument against vaccine use expressed by both parents and anthroposophic providers was that vaccines interfere with children's natural and necessary disease progression (8, 27-29). Distrust in those producing vaccines for the sole purpose of pro\u0000t was expressed in several papers (8, 27, 28). Agency and independent thinking All studies consistently highlight that for both parents of the anthroposophic community and anthroposophic providers, independent thinking, agency and the development of an individualized vaccination schedule is highly important (8, 24, 26-28). Parents see themselves as making a well-informed choice and they take pride in their choice. Sobo summarizses this: Alternative choices were taken to symbolize one's capacity for independent thinking. (27). Similarly, anthroposophic health providers highlight the importance of a tailored approach that allows for individual freedom of choice (24, 28). Individualized vaccination schedules were strongly advocated in all papers (8, 24, 26-28), as put by Sobo \"going along with the herd is not in keeping with the Waldorf ethos\" (27). Some papers advocated for the importance of offering single vaccines as opposed to combined vaccines, since there is ample skepticism towards combined vaccines and because parents want to pick and choose the diseases they want to address (24, 27). Stigma and social cohesion Participants in the studies describe two types of stigma associated with their vaccine beliefs. On the one hand they describe stigma regarding their vaccine choices from the community outside of their anthroposophic community as well as from mainstream health professionals (8, 26, 27). Participants in the studies describe a sense of security they gain by sticking together in their communities: I have chosen to live here [an anthroposophic community] to be surrounded by people who have similar beliefs so that I do not have to stand up for myself all the time. (8) In several papers, participants describe pride, hard work and courage that they are not simply following mainstream ideas. To summarize this in the words of a participant: committing to Waldorf education \"takes courage\" because it is so unconventional ...It shows that the parents are individual thinkers. .. it takes a lot of work to go against the grain of society\" (26, 27). Sobo further describes stigma to conform from within the anthroposophic community, particularly a Waldorf school setting. Parents describe that they actually do have different thoughts about vaccines than the community but fear to share those because they would threaten the social cohesion of the Waldorf identity. In Sobo's words: \"Waldor\u0000an identity make it harder and harder to contravene the norm without threatening one's sense of group membership, or creating cognitive dissonance\".(27). Discussion This systematic review showed that there have been a number of measles outbreaks associated with anthroposophic communities throughout Europe between the late 1990s and 2012 and one mumps outbreak. Vaccination catch up was not a popular strategy in the anthroposophic community but instead the importance of school closure was highlighted. Outbreaks were not reported after 2012, it is unclear whether this is because there isPage 20/24a lack of research or fewer outbreaks. This review further highlighted that vaccination coverage is low in anthroposophic communities, although evidence for this was somewhat weak and most focus was set on MMR vaccines. Most focus was arguably set on MMR vaccines due to numerous measles outbreaks associated with anthrophosophic communities. It would be important to understand speci\u0000c vaccination coverage in more detail. It would also be of value to understand coverage for adolescent vaccines such as HPV vaccines and meningitis vaccines. Recent studies have highlighted the important effect the HPV vaccine has had on reduction of cervical cancer - therefore ensuring that all groups are included, understanding the views of parents from the anthroposophic community on this speci\u0000c vaccine would have important public health implications. In terms of the qualitative \u0000ndings, the review revealed a broad range of vaccination beliefs and highlighted the importance of individual choice in the vaccine decision process. Although parents consider themselves well- informed, it is unclear from the studies where they obtain their information from, although some refer to the use of scienti\u0000c information. Tapping into these information networks is important to understand arguments on which many parents who belong to the anthroposophic community obtain their information. The challenge of the use information sources was particularly noted during the COVID-19 pandemic (30). Some information, for example the assumed link between low vaccination coverage and the development of allergies has been scienti\u0000cally addressed (31). The conclusion from this study showed that vaccines were not the cause for low allergy prevalence but rather other unknown lifestyle factors (31). This arguably highlights the importance of effective science communication. Although there are currently 28 articles that have investigated the relationship between vaccines and anthroposophy, it remains somewhat nebulous why anthroposophy as a religion or belief system is often considered as an anti-vax movement. Anthroposophical medicine does not reject vaccines, neither does it reject modern medicine. This was clearly stated at the inception of anthroposophical medicine and it has been a clear statement by Gotheanum. In 1925, Dr Rudolf Steiner and Dr Ita Wegman clearly stated \"It is not a matter of being in opposition to the school of medicine that is working with the accepted scienti\u0000c methods of the present time. We fully acknowledge its principles. ...we therefore feel compelled to work for an extension of clinical medicine, based on these wider insights into the nature of the world and the human being.\"(32) Sobo's article described in this review was the only paper that engaged with the anthroposophic movement, particularly the Waldorf school context that arguably cultivated vaccine hesitancy. The notion of building social cohesion through vaccine beliefs and decisions is an interesting and understudied concept. Understanding this further could perhaps help inform strategies to empower individuals to make their own decisions. For example, health providers engage with the question of how to address pressure to not vaccinate during their consultations. It would be interesting to further understand how stigma surrounding vaccine choices has changed in the context of COVID-19 vaccine decision making. Furthermore, if the school and community context is a strong factor in\u0000uencing vaccine decision-making, public health communication efforts should prioritize collaboration with the broader community rather than only health professionals working in that community. Given the low trust in public health authorities, this process will require a sensitive approach to avoid further alienation of the group. Lastly, the anthroposophic community prides itself on being different, communal and supportive as opposed to following principles of consumerism and individualism. However, none of the studies, except brief mentioning by Sobo mentioned discussed vaccines as a means for social action and to protect the vulnerable. Distrust and the feeling of exclusion may be one of the reasons for this but perhaps it is limited understanding of how vaccines actually work.Page 21/24Lastly, the stigma this group experiences highlights a problem that requires careful attention. This could also be an important \u0000nding for other so-called vaccine hesitant groups (33). One could argue that the more the anthroposophic group gets labeled as anti-vaxxers the stronger their views against society become. Vaccine decision making therefore is no longer about individual and public health but rather linked to beliefs that identify a group. The research on the anthroposophic community has been somewhat limited in recent years. It would be important to continue to monitor vaccine sentiments in the anthroposophic community, particularly in view of the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine and hesitancy linked with political sentiments (34, 35). Limitation There are some limitations to this systematic review. The review only includes peer-reviewed articles; this means that there have probably been other disease outbreaks linked to anthroposophic communities, which however were only described in the grey literature. Moreover, some of the studies describing the outbreaks are mere descriptions of the outbreaks rather than an analysis; therefore it is di\u0000cult to analyze in depth what actually happened. Conclusion This systematic review showed that there have been several measles outbreaks linked to anthroposophic communities in Europe. Although studies on vaccination coverage in anthroposophic communities are limited, it appears that this is lower than in the general population. There are a myriad of factors that in\u0000uence vaccine decision making of parents belonging to an anthroposophic community. However, some common themes were identi\u0000ed. The importance of experiencing childhood illnesses, and concerns over long-term side effects were mentioned. Moreover, parents want to be able to individually select vaccines for their children. They consider themselves actively engaged in vaccine decision making and well-informed. Stigma regarding vaccine choices were mentioned repeatedly mostly by people outside of the anthroposophic community but also by people within the community. This review calls for a better understanding on vaccine choices and beliefs for vaccines beyond MMR, in particular HPV vaccines. The review also highlights a potentially important research gap, which constitutes understanding not only a belief system but the role that vaccine rumours and decision making may play in cultivating social interaction.
