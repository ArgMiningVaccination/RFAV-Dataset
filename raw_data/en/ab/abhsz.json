There is separate guidance available for people living in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Introduction The success of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination programme has meant that the requirement for shielding and identifying people as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) is no longer necessary. Most people who were part of this CEV patient cohort are no longer at substantially greater risk than the general population and are advised to follow [the same guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-safely-with-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19) as everyone else on staying safe and preventing the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, as well as any further advice received from their healthcare professional. However, there remains a smaller number of people whose weakened immune system means they may be at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, despite vaccination. Enhanced protection measures, such as those offered by specific treatments or additional vaccinations alongside other protective behaviours, may benefit these individuals. This guidance is for those individuals who remain at higher risk. This page contains information on: - who this guidance is for - keeping yourself safe - COVID-19 vaccines - COVID-19 treatments - COVID-19 testing - if you test positive for COVID-19 - if you continue to test negative for COVID-19 and still feel unwell Who this guidance is for Immunosuppression means you have a weakened immune system due to a particular health condition or because you are on medication or treatment that suppresses your immune system. People who are immunosuppressed, or who have specific other medical conditions, may have a reduced ability to fight infections and other diseases, including COVID-19. Most people with immunosuppression will be under the care of a hospital specialist and will usually have been identified in one of 2 ways: 1. Eligibility for additional vaccines including COVID-19 boosters. 2. Eligibility for COVID-19 treatments. Further information on who is included in these groups of people is included in the sections on [vaccination](#vaccines) and [treatments](#treatment) below. If you are in one of these groups, consider following the guidance below on keeping yourself safe. Keeping yourself safe The following advice on 'keeping yourself safe' is aimed at adults. Children and young people are recommended to continue to attend education, unless they are advised otherwise by their clinician. Attending education is hugely important for children and young people's health and their future. If you have been advised by the NHS that you are in one of these groups, you are advised to: - ensure you have had all of the vaccines you are eligible to receive - continue to follow any condition-specific advice you may have been given by your specialist You are advised to try to avoid contact with people who have symptoms of COVID-19 or other respiratory infections. A detailed description of COVID-19 symptoms can be found in [guidance for people with symptoms of a respiratory infection including COVID-19](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19). If you have visitors to your home, consider ventilating your rooms by opening windows and doors to let fresh air in. More advice on [ventilating your home](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ventilation-to-reduce-the-spread-of-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19) can be found on GOV.UK. Consider asking visitors to your home to take additional precautions, such as keeping their distance. COVID-19 tests are no longer free for the general public, but you may wish to ask visitors to take a lateral flow device (LFD) test before visiting. You might also consider asking them to wear a face covering and you may want to wear a face covering yourself. If it feels right for you, work from home if you can. If you cannot work from home, speak to your employer about what arrangements they can make to reduce your risk. It may be that you are entitled to a [Reasonable Adjustment under the Equality Act](https://www.gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers). See [Public health principles for reducing the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections in the workplace](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reducing-the-spread-of-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19-in-the-workplace) If you are too ill to work, you may be [eligible for Statutory Sick Pay](https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay). When out and about, you may want to try to keep your distance from others if that feels right for you, and consider reducing the time you spend in crowded spaces or anywhere that is enclosed or poorly ventilated. Wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face. Consider wearing a well-fitting face covering in crowded public spaces. Although face coverings are primarily worn to protect others, because they cover the nose and mouth, which are the main routes of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 infection, they may also provide some limited protection to the wearer. Further advice about face coverings can be found in guidance on [living safely with respiratory infections including COVID-19](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-safely-with-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19). COVID-19 vaccines If you have a weakened immune system due to a health condition or medical treatment, and you are aged 5 years or over, you can receive a further COVID-19 vaccination booster this spring for extra protection if it has been at least 6 months since your last vaccination. Adults aged over 75 years and residents in a care home for older adults are also eligible for an additional booster dose this spring. The [spring COVID-19 booster campaign](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-spring-booster-resources) will begin on 17 April in England, with the national booking system opening beforehand. Vaccination of residents in older adult care homes will start ahead of this from 3 April. Those with a weakened immune system can book online without waiting to be invited. It might help to take the vaccination invite letter, or an NHS letter describing your condition or treatment, or a repeat prescription slip with you. How to book You can [book or manage a COVID-19 vaccination online](http://www.nhs.uk/get-vaccination) through the NHS website. If you can't book online, phone 119 free of charge, 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday or 8am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday. You can ask someone else to do this for you. Please ensure you have your NHS number at hand. If you need an interpreter, use text phone 18001 119 or the [NHS British Sign Language interpreter service](http://www.signvideo.co.uk/nhs119). Alternatively, you can [find a walk-in vaccination site near you](http://www.nhs.uk/vaccine-walk-in) on NHS.UK. You don't need to book an appointment with a walk-in site but please check before visiting that they can vaccinate you - not all sites vaccinate all age groups. The NHS strongly encourages those with a weakened immune system to take up their offer for the spring 2023 COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible to ensure they have the highest possible level of protection. [Further information on COVID-19 vaccinations](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/) is available on NHS.UK. COVID-19 treatments The NHS is offering treatments to those people with COVID-19 who are at highest risk of becoming seriously ill and who are aged 12 years or above. Not all treatments are suitable for people aged 12 to 17 years. The list of eligible people who are offered these treatments is regularly reviewed and currently includes some people who have: - Down's syndrome, or another chromosomal disorder that affects their immune system - certain types of cancer or have received treatment for certain types of cancer - sickle cell disease - certain conditions affecting their blood - chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 or 5 - severe liver disease - an organ transplant - certain autoimmune or inflammatory conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease) - HIV or AIDS who have a weakened immune system - inherited or acquired conditions affecting their immune system - rare neurological conditions: multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease or myasthenia gravis You may have been made aware that you are potentially eligible for COVID-19 treatments by a letter or email from NHS England or from your consultant. If you have not been contacted and you think you should have been, your consultant will be able to confirm if you are eligible for COVID-19 treatments. A broader group of patients (currently those aged 18 years and over, and with underlying health conditions) may also be able to take part in the [PANORAMIC clinical study](https://www.panoramictrial.org/) if they test positive for COVID-19 and are symptomatic. COVID-19 testing In England, patients eligible for COVID-19 treatments can access LFD tests from the government but are no longer automatically sent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. If you were previously sent a PCR test you can keep it, but do not use it unless asked to do so by your NHS team. If you are eligible for COVID-19 treatments, please make sure you have a supply of LFD tests at home so that you can test yourself quickly if you develop symptoms of COVID-19. [Symptoms of COVID-19, flu and other respiratory infections](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19#symptoms-of-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19) include: - a high temperature - unexplained tiredness or lack of energy - shortness of breath - a loss of, or change to, your normal sense of smell or taste Those who are eligible should have already been sent one pack of LFD tests or, if you are newly eligible, you will be sent a pack of tests to keep at home to use if you become symptomatic. These are tests you can do at home and can be used to detect if you have COVID-19. If you have not received the LFD tests but you think you may be eligible for COVID-19 treatments, you can [order a pack of LFD tests](https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests) from GOV.UK or call 119 if needed. Test kits contain instructions and links to support for those who need assistance in testing. You should use LFD tests supplied by the government. The results of tests bought privately, such as from a supermarket or pharmacy, cannot be registered on GOV.UK and you will not be contacted about treatment if you test positive using these tests. If you have COVID-19 symptoms you should take an LFD test immediately, even if your symptoms are mild. You must [report your result](https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result) on GOV.UK or by calling 119. This will help to ensure timely access to treatments if eligible. It is important to provide your NHS number and postcode correctly so you can be contacted. If your test is negative but you still have symptoms, you should take another test on each of the next 2 days (3 tests in total over 3 days). If you test positive If any of your LFD tests are positive, you are symptomatic and you have reported the result, the NHS should contact you about treatment. If you are not contacted by the NHS within 24 hours of your positive test, call your GP surgery, 111, or your specialist clinician if you have one, who can make an urgent referral. If you test positive, you should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Further advice about staying at home can be found in [guidance for people with symptoms of a respiratory infection including COVID-19](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19). If you continue to test negative and still feel unwell If you continue to feel unwell, you should seek healthcare advice via your GP or 111. If it is an emergency, you should call 999. "}
