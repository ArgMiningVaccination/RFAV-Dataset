For individuals seeking out treatment centers and medication-assisted treatment in San Diego, Villa Oasis offers professional support and upscale treatment options. Our luxurious environment and landscape of natural beauty lend themselves to help ease the detox process. The [initial stages of treatment](https://villaoasissandiego.com/blog/what-to-expect-in-the-first-30-days-of-treatment/) for an alcohol or drug addiction begin with detoxification at our San Diego drug rehab. Detox begins the process to eliminate toxins or chemical substances from the body without having the patient suffer potentially fatal withdrawals. For those who are physically dependent on substances, a safe detox is an essential part of the practical recovery process. Detoxification is the process by which the body gets rid of toxins. This includes toxins and addictive substances such as alcohol or drugs. With long-term substance abuse, or sometimes just a single exposure, toxins accumulate within the body. At our drug treatment center, detox is supervised by medical professionals, allowing the body to safely rid itself of these substances. Our [residential treatment facility in San Diego](https://villaoasissandiego.com/addiction-treatment/residential-rehab/) is also equip to handle the resulting addiction recovery process that follows detoxification. A successful detox stabilizes the brain's chemistry, which then allows for an accurate assessment of the resident's physical and psychological condition. From here, a person's journey through drug and alcohol addiction can transform into a path to wellness and healing. Our substance abuse recovery center is fully prepared to help patients find peace after their drug detox. Withdrawal is not a comfortable process, so our San Diego luxury rehab helps drug abuse patients find the peace they'll need during this delicate time. After the body has become dependent on drugs and alcohol, it can feel nearly impossible to stop using. When substance use is abruptly stopped it is major shock to the entire system. For this reason, detox almost always involves withdrawal symptoms, which the staff at Villa Oasis helps residents to manage. The type and severity of withdrawal symptoms can vary from person to person. Withdrawal symptoms are based on the particular substance and the length of use. Common withdrawal symptoms include: Some of these withdrawal symptoms\u2014like vomiting or diarrhea\u2014may seem not too serious. However, the rapid dehydration they cause can be fatal. For this reason, most addiction treatment programs include a detox that is supervised by medical professionals. Benzodiazepine and alcohol addiction are both especially dangerous substances to detox from. If you or your loved one needs treatment for [alcohol rehab](https://villaoasissandiego.com/addiction-treatment/alcohol-treatment/) or [benzodiazepine addiction treatment,](https://villaoasissandiego.com/addiction-treatment/benzodiazepine-treatment/) reach out and speak with one of our experts to see what treatment options would be best. Medical detox can mean one of two things: The medications used in such treatment act on the brain's pathways in the same way the addictive substance does. These medications signal the brain to stop the withdrawal symptoms that occur when substance use is abruptly stopped. The medications used in such treatment act on the brain's pathways in the same way the addictive substance does. These medications signal the brain to stop the withdrawal symptoms that occur when substance use is abruptly stopped. In other words, the medications are safer than the addictive drug or alcohol. However, detox medications do affect the brain in a similar way. Once this kind of treatment begins, the resident will no longer experience physical cravings for the drug or alcohol. The substitute medication fulfills the physical and mental demands of the addiction. At Villa Oasis rehab center, the detox process is supported by a comfortable and positive setting. Medical professionals and staff members are committed to a culture of warmth and authentic care. We pride ourselves on treating residents and their loved ones with compassion and respect.

In addition, Villa Oasis: Different substances remain in the body for different lengths of time\u2014which affects the time required for detox. In most cases, a resident suffering from a [Substance use disorder (SUD)](https://psychiatry.org/patients-families/addiction-substance-use-disorders/what-is-a-substance-use-disorder/) can expect to detox from the substance within a week. However, cravings may continue for weeks or months longer. Detoxing from alcohol or drugs includes clearing the body of toxic substances and managing any withdrawal symptoms that may occur. The entire detox process can take anywhere from a few days to several months. For instance, alcohol leaves the body within a few days\u2014but detoxing from alcohol cravings may take much longer. The total amount of time required to complete the detox process depends upon many factors. Generally, the determining factors for a detox process include; the resident's age, weight, drinking habits, and other health issues. How long detox takes depends upon: The detox experience of each resident will depend upon the particular substance that is being detoxified and their patterns of use. For instance, the physical symptoms of alcohol detox generally taper off within a week. Meanwhile, cravings can continue to be strong until the therapeutic process is completed. In cases of severe opioid or heroin addiction, withdrawal symptoms may persist for six months or longer. For this reason, it is important to seek help from a professional treatment provider or drug detox in a comprehensive rehab program.
