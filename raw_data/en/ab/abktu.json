As therapists, we focus on emotional and mental healing. And we recognize the physical impact of mental and emotional illness. We often incorporate various somatic therapies to address the physical aspects. So why do we ignore the spiritual impact of mental and emotional illness? For some reason, spiritual health is misconstrued as woo-woo. Incorporating the spiritual realm into your clinical practice is a collaboration. You don't have to pit one against the other. With what you learn in this course, you'll have the partnership of science and energy working for you in your practice. \"Exciting new ways of thinking about and working with clients!\" - Cynthia M.

You'll be led through an exercise to cultivate an internal relationship so you can sense what your own body is trying to tell you and reveal the secrets it is holding.

You'll understand the neuroscience of the inner wisdom at your core, discover your unique way of accessing Self energy, and how to hone your ways of responding to clients so you can engage resilience to overcome trauma. In this session, we will discuss: Ways to access Self energy and develop a practice around your own internal wisdom The three dimensions of Self energy \u2014 inner, environmental, and beyond \u2014 available for you to access The neuroscience of Self energy that explains how this energy works within the nervous system The difference between empathy and compassion \u2014 and when to use one or the other Module 2: ENERGY, SCIENCE, AND HEALING In Module 2, Frank will introduce you to all the types of energy, and show you how different areas of energy - colors, movement, sensations, and visions \u2014 represent emotions.
