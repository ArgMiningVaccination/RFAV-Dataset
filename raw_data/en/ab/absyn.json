I work with clients both in person and online via ZOOM. Let this commitment to healing yourself be a turning point in your life. Hi, I'm Dr. Marissa Castello. I'm a naturopathic doctor, mother, author, educator, and hypnotherapist. I practice potent healing therapies, draw from personal life experience, channel energy, and harness my medical expertise to help you tap into your personal power and uplevel your life in a holistic way - from wellness to relationships to career to physical health and beyond. Because as important as it is to heal your body when it's hurt... I've found people also need loving guidance diving into the depths of their being, their trauma, and the things holding them back from living their full potential. I work to transform lives - meaning I don't focus on supplements, lab values, mindset, meditation, diet, or some other factor, but I look at the whole picture. Because I've seen firsthand how total transformation requires ongoing, holistic, one-on-one support that meets you where you're currently and helps you get to where you want to be. I offer a 6-Week Energetic Self-Mastery course, as well as programs to support mental health and physical wellness. My 3 or 6-month mentorship program help you get from where you are to where you want to be, in body, mind, and spirit. "}
