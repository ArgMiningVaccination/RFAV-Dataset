There have been reductions in the mitigations (reduced testing, support payments and legal need for self-isolation) and this has created uncertainty around case rates and the risk of delayed detection of new variants.

The risk to economic performance is a combination of the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus, Brexit, labour shortages, infrastructure challenges relating to material supply and general uncertainty in many sectors. Some of the long-term effects (especially without effective policy instruments) are likely to carry into later in 2022 and beyond. Risk Category: DEVELOPMENT & REGENERATION4 4 16 4 4 The impact of COVID-19 on the economy has been sharp and has affected different sectors of the economy in different ways. We are focussing, through Resurgam, on 6 areas to help our economy to recover, to protect local jobs and to support our communities. These are: Spend 4 Plymouth - A massive focus on local procurement for local jobs. Build 4 Plymouth - An ambitious capital programme and economic stimulus to support construction jobs, building a better and greener Plymouth. Skills 4 Plymouth - Extensive new support for young people and retraining our workforce for future jobs through our skills launch pad. City Centre Renaissance programme - support for our city centre and a regeneration plan. Resurgam Beacons - A focus on our future. We will seek to create new jobs in the Blue and green economy. That is our amazing marine sector and a new green deal for jobs. Sector Action Plans - a bespoke package of interventions lead by the private sector for our 11 key sectors, building on our Resurgam plans and innovating and collaborating together though our newly established Sector Hub. Supporting our sectors whether they are in critical shock, stable, or capable of high growth. These sectors are: o Construction and The Built Environment o Creative Industries o Digital o Defence o Health and Care o Fishing o Manufacturing o Marine o Retail o Tourism and Hospitality o Transport and Distribution We have also established the cross cutting theme of inclusive growth. Our aim is to 'build back better' growing a prosperous economy that reduces inequality, is sustainable and truly serves the wellbeing of all the people of Plymouth. Please note: Construction inflation will have an impact on projects and is predicted to rise by 26% by 2026 (3% per quarter). 8 Failure to reduce Health Inequalities will mean our poorest residents continue to live shorter lives as well as more years in ill health. Mounting evidence that COVID-19 is having differential health impacts across communities, adding to existing health inequalities. This is through either the disease itself or the mitigations put in place. There is an ongoing impact of this due to the economic downturn. The primary role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to try to manage COVID-19 in the city therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts. Risk Category: COMPLIANCE, REGULATION & SAFEGUARDINGThe Thrive Plymouth framework was adopted by full Council in 2014 and links directly to the Plymouth Plan and Integrated Commissioning Strategies. It provides a good foundation to achieve prevention in all services and decision making processes. The focus of Thrive Plymouth in year one was on workplace health and wellbeing, in year two it was on schools and young people, in year three it was on localising the national 'One You' health improvement campaign. In year four was on mental wellbeing (focussing on the five ways to wellbeing) and in year five was on people connecting through food. The intention was that the year six focus would be arts, culture, heritage and health (using the Mayflower 400 commemorations as the vehicle for delivery). However, this year was curtailed as a result of the pandemic and a two year pause was put on the programme. Thrive Plymouth Year seven was launched in May 2022 with a focus on Listening and Reconnecting. In addition to the Thrive Plymouth- related work, the Public Health Team has worked with an extensive network of internal and external partners to secure the opening of a number of Wellbeing Hubs across the city.4 4SED1 COVID-19 BREXIT Sarah Lees / Rob NelderSTS1 IRR COVID-19Office of the Director of Public HealthAAnthony Payne 16 4 4 APersistent action across the Council is required at many levels to tackle inequalities by addressing the wider detriments of health. The Public Health Team and partners continue to work with employers (year one focus) and schools (year two focus) to influence healthier lifestyles. The team continues to embed and promote the national One You campaign across the city. The 'five ways to wellbeing' has been adopted across the City as the single approach to improving mental wellbeing. The work that started in year five on 'people connecting through food' is ongoing with a number of new initiatives developed. The intention was that the year six focus would be arts, culture, heritage and health (using the Mayflower 400 commemorations as the vehicle for delivery). However, this year was curtailed as a result of the pandemic and a two year pause was put on the programme. Subsequently, Thrive Plymouth Year seven was launched in May 2022 with a focus on Listening and Reconnecting. There is a need to reflect on our experiences and acknowledge what we have been through. Though there has been much trauma, we believe that there have also been some positives which we want to help the city to build on and apply to the wider challenges of inequality. Evidence has been provided to the Health and Wellbeing Board on the risk of widening health inequalities which partners are working together to try to mitigate. The Local Care Partnership priorities are being refreshed and includes tackling inequalities. Both of these routes bring partners together to understand the issues and the steps needed to tackle health inequalities in the City. In addition to this, to support the work of the Council's cross-party Child Poverty Action Plan Working Group, a high level review of the evidence of the impacts of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of children and young people has been carried out. As already stated, the primary role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to minimise the impact of COVID-19 in the city therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts.Ruth HarrellDavid Draffan 16OFFICIAL APPENDIX B PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL STRATEGIC REGISTER MAY 2022 ROW NO RISK REFDirectorat eService DEPTDESCRIPTION OF RISK (Risk description should include cause / risk event / consequence and risk category)Policies and procedures Link to business plan Delegations of authority / Fraud checks Risk and control framework Performance Management Project Management reviewsRAG RATING /CHANG E IN RISK RATINGACTION PLAN / FUTURE MITIGATION / ASSURANCE PLANRESPONSIBLE OFFICER(S) DIRECTOR / ASSISTANT DIRECTOR P I P I P I PREVIOUS RISK RATING Feb-22 CURRENT RISK RATINGPREVIOUS RISK RATING First Line of Defence (Operational management activity) Oct-21 May-22 9 PEOPLE (IC) COVID-19 IRRPeople SC Strategic Commissi oningIncreased and sustained pressure on Adult Social Care budget due to increased costs of providing care, growing numbers of people and increased complexity of need.

The Plymouth Standards Partnership Recovery & Improvement Plan: A key priority is work to support disadvantaged pupils. The work of the Plymouth Commission has been extended to focus on attainment for secondary aged pupils and school improvement. This has also focussed on the impact of the COVID-19 response arrangements, and a survey of all secondary schools has been undertaken to inform priorities for re- engaging pupils in September. Schools are expected to have the capacity to offer immediate remote education for classes or groups who are required to self-isolate for a short period of time, or where there are local restrictions requiring pupils to remain at home. Schools are being offered a catch up premium of \u00a380 per pupils for most schools, to assist with programmes of learning to support pupils who require additional support. At this time, it is intended that subject to some adjustments to content and activity, in the summer 2021 for GCSE, AS and A level are all teacher assessed.Ming Zhang Sharon Muldoon 14 SHR2 COVID-19 HSWCustomer and Corporate ServicesHROD Customer & Corporate HRODThe Council not meeting its legal obligations regarding the health, safety and wellbeing of its workforce.

EU Settlement Scheme closed to new applicants in July predicted labour market shortage is now starting to show and are acute in some sectors including health and social care.

Ferry services have recommenced no operational problems arising from phase 1 and 2 of the Border Operating Model delivery of BCP delayed until November but ferry services will be suspended from October until March. Macro economic affects now starting to ramp up inflationary pressure are rising e.g. wage increases fuel to labour market supply problems and supply shortages leading to prices rises especially on fuel which feeds wider price increases, likely the MPC will react with interest rate increases and could also impact on currency rates. Unilateral UK changes in regulations could add additional unfunded burdens to LAs of radically impact on service delivery e.g. planning reforms. Brexit Organisational and City specific risk registers linked to corporate risk registers are no longer being updated. Economic and consequential finical risks impacts may be traced back to Brexit but there is limited political will to do so and they are largely now viewed simply as the new economic reality. As such they are probably best dealt with through mainstream council financial risk management. One exception sis in relation to labour market shortages which are likely to have direct impact on Council finances in staff recruitment and associated wage pressures especially in health and social care and indirect impact through potential business relocation where labour requirements cannot be met locally. Operational readiness needs to be maintained in relation to the evolving UK post brexit regulatory framework and in particular in relation to the border control issues that are likely to arise when the Uk finally implements the proposed border control model as this is likely to create a new set of supply chain related issues as well as an increased administrative burden at our port. 4 312 4 312 4 312 AContinued regional engagement to maintain strong influence.

Plymouth City Council declared a climate emergency in March 2019. The Plymouth Plan was revised in January 2021 to update the strategic objectives and policies to achieve this outcome. The activities of Plymouth City Council only contribute 1% of the total carbon emissions of the city. The environmental consequences of failing to meet the target are difficult to quantify, but a failure to address and minimise our carbon emissions would contribute to some extent to changes in our climate, which include, among others, increased risk of coastal flooding and changes to the weather patterns. Changes to the weather could in turn have financial consequences for the Council as we mitigate against increased flooding, and more frequent storms. Failure to meet corporate targets would impact our reputation and our ability to exercise leadership on this agenda, with, in turn, possibly more consequences on carbon emissions citywide.A governance structure is in place to ensure that the city and council climate emergency objectives are led, managed and delivered. Led by the Cabinet member for Climate Change, all key decisions are made by Cabinet and Full Council. The Strategic Director for Place leads the Climate Emergency Board with oversight of the corporate objectives. Management and deliverables are led by the service director for strategic planning and infrastructure. Progress updates on the delivery of the plans are provided 6 monthly. Interim policies and performance monitoring arrangements are in place whilst we tackle the complex task of developing a methodology that will enable us to accurately measure and monitor carbon emissions. In future, the methodology being developed will help to identify any potential risks to achieving the target\" There are 3 key plans in place to deliver objectives. * The Plymouth Plan specifically Policy GRO7 \"Reducing carbon emissions and adapting to climate change\", annual Climate Emergency Action Plans (CEAP) and Corporate Carbon Reduction Plans (CCRP)3 412 3 412 3 412 A Process of annual CEAP and CCRP action plans in place, with six monthly performance updates to scrutiny committee Climate Emergency Board meets four times / year to keep programme under review Review of governance and strategy / action planning process underwayPaul Barnard Anthony PayneOFFICIAL APPENDIX B PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL STRATEGIC RISK REGISTER MAY 2022 ROW NO RISK REFDirectorat eService DEPTDESCRIPTION OF RISK (Risk description should include cause / risk event / consequence and risk category)Policies and procedures Link to business plan Delegations of authority / Fraud checks Risk and control framework Performance Management Project Management reviewsRAG RATING /CHANG E IN RISK RATINGACTION PLAN / FUTURE MITIGATION / ASSURANCE PLANRESPONSIBLE OFFICER(S) DIRECTOR / ASSISTANT DIRECTOR P I P I P I PREVIOUS RISK RATING Feb-22 CURRENT RISK RATINGPREVIOUS RISK RATING First Line of Defence (Operational management activity) Oct-21 May-22 18 PLACE (SPI)Place SS Street ServicesRisk of financial impact of delivering proposed changes to Waste Services as set out in the Government's Draft Environment Bill. Whilst the Government have stated that Local Authorities will not bear the cost of the changes the implications for Plymouth specifically are significant with likely changes to collection frequencies; plant, vehicle and machinery requirements; a weekly food waste collection and likely impacts upon existing waste disposal contracts including the Energy from Waste PFI contract. Waste policies and strategy will need to be reviewed to ensure compliance and alongside working with residents, communities and businesses to help manage any changes. A key requirement will also be understanding any resulting waste infrastructure requirements and where possible including appropriate provisions alongside evidence as part of the next iteration of the Plymouth and South West Devon Joint Local Plan scheduled for mid 2022. The Government are required to set out Statutory Instruments detailing the Environmental Bill requirements by Autumn 2022 with an indicative timescale for implementation of requirements by 2023/24.

The funding for this work has been wholly met by DEFRA. The initial report was completed with broadly inconclusive findings. The scope of ongoing work is as follows: - To understand the implications of, and ensure the Council meets, the government's requirements as proposed in the Resources & Waste Strategy - To help inform the future design of the Council's household waste collection service and understand the implications in terms of reprocessing infrastructure - To understand the likely impact that changes to the current household waste collection service will have on the Council's recycling performance - To consider where operational efficiencies can be achieved whilst still delivering a service that meets the needs of its residents and allows the Council to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction - To appraise whether existing waste management infrastructure and assets in Plymouth, and the surrounding area, are likely to be sufficient for future requirements; and if they are deemed not to be then to provide options to inform the Council's waste strategy and spatial planning.Philip Robinson Anthony Payne 19 HROD (CCS)CCS HROD HROD Staff resilience to causative factors of stress variable resulting in the primary reason for short and long term absences being due to stress / psychological factors; reduced morale, loss of productivity with impact on delivery; financial loss due to need to engage agency staff to cover and legal requirement to assess risk and make reasonable adjustments / remedial actions Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations (1999) Risk Category: Compliance, Regulation and SafeguardingCorporate wellbeing and resilience survey undertaken in Aug 2018 and results triangulated with other relevant data; priorities for action identified from analysis and all service areas required to have action plans in place to deliver as part of their business plans for 2019/20.

During the audit of the 2019/20 accounts - which was delayed because of the Pandemic - it became apparent that the External Auditor did not agree that the accounting treatment used was lawful. During 2021 the Council has taken further legal advice to identify a lawful way of accounting for the transaction; consideration of this advice continues at the present time. The risk is that if a lawful way of accounting for the transaction cannot be agreed with the External Auditor and advising counsel then the Council may need to explore with Government alternative means of achieving a solution which sits within the appropriate legal parameters. 0 TBC - subject to ongoing legal adviceLiaison with legal advisers Consultation with the Auditor Possible Consultation with GovernmentBrendon Arnold Brendon Arnold3 G3 9 Anthony Payne 20 3 SSPI2 COVID-19 BREXITPaul Barnard Strategic Planning & Infrastruct ure (Housing & Infrastruct ure)3 9 Driving progress on previous Plan for Homes site releases to seek accelerated construction of new homes, progress regularly reviewed with Portfolio Holder.
