This memorandum rescinds Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Memorandum \"Force Health Protection Guidance (Supplement 17)- Department of Defense Guidance for the Use of Masks, Personal Protective Equipment, and Non\u00acPharmaceutical Interventions During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,\" March 17, 2021, and supplements Secretary of Defense Memorandum, \"Use of Masks and Other Public Health Measures,\" February 4, 2021, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum, \"Updated Mask Guidelines for Vaccinated Persons,\" May 13, 2021, with updated guidance on the use of masks in conjunction with other public health measures, including non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This memorandum includes updated guidance for fully vaccinated personnel. It maintains guidance on use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Service members and civilian employees who misrepresent their vaccination status may be subject to appropriate adverse administrative or punitive actions. In accordance with this guidance, unmasked, fully vaccinated Service members should be prepared to show proof of vaccination (CDC vaccination card or other medical documentation). As a general matter, in accordance with references (e) and (f), supervisors may not inquire about or verify the vaccination status of civilian employees. For purposes of determining whether a civilian employee must wear a mask on military installations, unmasked civilian employees may be asked to confirm vaccination status only if the supervisor has a reasonable basis to believe the unmasked employee has not been fully vaccinated, based on reliable evidence such as firsthand knowledge of voluntary employee statements. Supervisors must follow applicable force health protection guidance and implement appropriate workplace measures to protect all employees, assuming that not everyone will be vaccinated. OSD and DoD Components will comply with applicable labor relations obligations to the extent such obligations do not conflict with the agency's ability to conduct operations during this emergency.
