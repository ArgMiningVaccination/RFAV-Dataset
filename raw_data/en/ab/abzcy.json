[Manage stress](/health/stress/manage-stress/) Research has been unable to discover the cause of [fibromyalgia](/health/fibromyalgia/fibromyalgia/) and because of this, doctors have yet to find a way to treat the root of the problem. Treatment of fibromyalgia is focused on reducing troublesome [symptoms](/health/fibromyalgia/symptoms/). In addition, people suffering from fibromyalgia experience different patterns of symptoms and as no single treatment will work for everyone, a number of treatments, methods or therapies may need to be used, changed or adapted depending on your response. This article describes the most common treatments used for fibromyalgia. Many aspects of fibromyalgia resemble post-viral fatigue syndrome or ME (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis) - a condition where the [immune system](/health/immune-system/the-immune-system.php) is weak and unable to fight viruses such as those causing colds and flu.

This could be the direct result of feeling constantly unwell, but some researchers have found that fibromyalgia in itself, can cause low mood and depression because the condition affects the way the brain works. Those suffering from the symptoms of low mood preferring to avoid the use of prescribed anti-depressants may opt for the use of herbal remedies such as A.Vogel [Neuroforce ](/products/homeopathics/neuroforce-formula/)available from your local health store or pharmacy without prescription. Poor sleep is a very common problem experienced by those suffering from fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe a sleeping pill to help you sleep better at night.

Before giving you a prescription for sleeping pills, many doctors will probably recommend that you try a [herbal sleep remedy](/products/herbals/dormeasan/) first. Over the years, these have become popular as alternatives to sleeping tablets. These licensed herbal medicines contain the herb valerian, combined with other herbs such as hops or passiflora.
