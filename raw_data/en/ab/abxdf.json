Meningococcal disease can also present as focal infections such as pneumonia, arthritis or pericarditis. Meningococcal disease develops rapidly, often among previously healthy persons, and results i n high morbidity and mortality. Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a major cause of meningitis and septicaemia. The disease often has a rapid progression, with an 8 -15% case fatality rat e even with a ppropriate antibiotic therapy. 10%-20% of survivors have long -term sequelae such as neurologic al disability, limb or digit loss, or hearing loss.1 The highest incidence occurs in young children, with a second disease peak among adolescents and young adults. Meningococci are divided into antigenically dist inct serogroups. Twelve capsular groups have been identified to date: A, B, C, E, H, I, K, L, W, X, Y and Z . Groups B, C, W and Y were historically the most common in Europe. Following the routine vaccination against serogroup C, serogroup B has become the most common, with an increase in W and Y serogroups in recent years, especially among adolescents. Outbreaks of meningococcal disease are rare, but can occur in settings where people assemble , such as college campuses and military recruits. For the immu nisation against meningococcal disease, several vaccines are available for different age groups with different vaccination schedules. Some are monovalent, with a single serogroup (monovalent C vaccines and a meningococcal B vaccine) , and another is a quadr ivalent vaccine including the A, C, W and Y serogroups. Regarding the national meningococcal vaccine recommendations , please refer to the Swiss vaccination schedule issued by the Federal Vaccination Commission and the Federal Office of Public Health. 1 Meningococcal Vaccination: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2020 | MMWR (cdc.gov) SwissPAR 7 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 4 Quality Aspects 4.1 Drug Substance The active substance consists of four bulks of polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrate from the Neisseria A, C, W135 and Y. The conjugated antigens used in this vaccine are intended to elic it a serological immune response upon injection by the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the respective capsular polysaccharides. The drug substance is manufactured by propagation and fermentation of the working seeds of each N. meningitidi s serogroup strain. The fermentation broth is processed by multiple steps , including inactivation, ethanol precipitation, filtration, washing and drying. The purified polysaccharide powder is individually coupled to tetanus toxoid , which is prepared by fer mentation of a Clostridium tetani working seed, cell lysis, purification of the toxin, inactivation of the toxin to the toxoid and purification of the toxoid. The manufacturing process is adequately controlled and has been validated with full -scale batches . The characteri sation of the drug substance and its impurities was performed using state of the art methods (e.g. 1D The specifications include identity tests, purity and residual tests, sterility and endotoxins. Batch analysis data from commercial scale batches show that the drug substance can be manufactured consistently and to defined quality standards. All analytical methods are described and validated. The drug substance is stored at -80\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C. A shelf life of 48 months has been accepted. 4.2 Drug Product The finished product is supplied in liquid form filled in 2 mL unit dose vials. Each labe lled vial contains a 0.5 mL dose. The formulation is prepared to contain 10 g of each of the meningoco ccal polysaccharid e serogroups A, C, W and Y, conjugated to approximately 55 g tetanus toxoid protein carrier in a sodium acetate buffered saline solution. The finished product manufacturing process includes blending of the four monovalent conjugate bulks , sterile filtration and filling. Process validation studies were conducted at commercial scale. The specifications include relevant tests and limits, e.g. for appearance, potency, pH, identity, purity, sterility and endotoxins. All analytical methods are adequately described and non -compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Batch analysis data were provided for three consistency/process validation batches, four batches at the lower commercial scale and three batches at the higher commercial scale. The container closure system for the final product consists of a type I glass vial with a latex -free stopper and a flip -off seal. The drug product is stored at 2 - 8\u00b0C. No significant changes are observed over time during stabi lity studies within the proposed storage conditions. A shelf life of 48 months has been accepted. The product should not be frozen and should be kept in the outer carton. 4.3 Quality Conclusions Satisfactory and consistent quality of drug substance and drug pr oduct has been demonstrated.

Overall, the submitted nonclinical documentation is considered appropriate to support the approval of MenQuadfi for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older, against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. The pharmaco -toxicological profile has been sufficiently characterised. There were no safety issues identified in the nonclinical studies that would be of concern for human use. All nonclinical data that are relevant for safety are adequately mentioned in the information for healthcare professionals.

Anti-capsular meningococcal antibod ies protect against - mediated bactericidal activity. Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines induce the production of to the capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis sero groups A, C, W and Y. Human bactericidal activity with human complement (hSBA) can be used to infer effectiveness of meningococcal conjugate vaccines. The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) assay has been the accepted surrogate marker for meningococcal vacc ine efficacy since the mid -1970s, established by the findings of Goldschneider et al.2 A hSBA tit re of 1:8 and/or a fourfold rise in hSBA tit res have been used to infer vaccine -mediated immunologic protection against meningococcal disease. Most of the sub mitted studies assessed the immunogenicity based on hSBA tit res, for vaccine seroresponse (defined as titr es 1:16 if pre -vaccination tit res were <1:8, or tit res 4 -fold if pre - vaccination tit res were 1:8), for seroprotection rates (defined as hSBA tit res 1:8) and for GMTs, although some studies concomitantly used rSBA (serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement ) titres as well. 6.2 Final Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology Benefit Risk Assessment For the marketing authorisation application of MenQua dfi, Clinical Assessment conducted an abridged evaluation for the population aged 2 years and above , based on the EMA assessment report (EMA/CHMP/452679/2020) and the corresponding SmPC provided by the applicant. Our clinical review primarily focused on t he data from the 12 -23 month -old population, as the initially submitted clinical data package was considered limited for this age group. The immunogenicity and safety of MenQuadfi in toddlers aged 12 -23 months were assessed in the pivotal Study MET 51 and supportive study MET54. Study MET 57 evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of MenQuadfi co - administration with other p aediatric vaccines. Based on the submitted studies , the antibody persistence beyond 30 days post -vaccination was not evaluated, and the safety profile in the above age group was assessed mostly up to 30 days post - vaccination. Additionally, the comparator vaccine used in the toddler studies was a conjugated quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine not aut horised in Switzerland. The antibody levels against the serogroups should be assessed beyond 30 days post -vaccination, especially in toddlers as , like infants, they are especially prone to develop invasive meningococcal disease. The rapid waning of the antibodies against serogroup A is known for other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. In particular, the seroresponse rates for serogroup A were consistently the lowest among the four serogroup s for MenQuadfi. Furthermore, in Study MET51 in toddlers , the immune response aga inst serogroup W was also weaker compared to the other two serogroups, and the assessment of the antibody levels beyond 30 days was of the utmost importance and was additionally required. Study MET51 was a modified double -blind, randomi sed, parallel -group , active -controlled, multi -centre trial in toddlers, 12 to 23 months of age, who were either meningococcal vaccine -na\u00efve or had received monovalent meningococcal C (MenC) vaccination during infancy. 2 Goldschneider et al 1969 SwissPAR 10 / 13 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Based on the results of Study MET51 , the immunogenicity o f MenQuadfi was shown to be non -inferior to the comparator vaccine 30 days post -vaccination (Table 1 in the Information for healthcare professionals), however an impact of the MenC priming could not be ruled out as differences could be observed depending o n previously received MenC conjugate protein. However the clinical relevance of the lower hSBA titres with similar seroprotection rates seen in children primed with a Men C -CRM vaccine in infancy is not known, considerations should be given in individuals at high risk of meningococcal A infection. The data separately for the MenC -TT and MenC -CRM priming are presented in a tabulated form in Table 2 in the Information for healthcare professionals. Study MET 54 was a phase 2, randomi sed, parallel active -controlled, open -label study in 200 healthy, meningococcal -vaccine na\u00efve toddlers aged 12 to 23 months in Finland. It evaluated the immunogenicity and safety profile of a single dose of MenQuadfi given alone compared to that of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine licensed in Europe but not in Switzerland. The immunogenicity results showed that the hSBA GMTs at day 30 post -vaccination for serogroup s A and Y were comparable with, and for serogroup s C and W were higher than, the comparator vaccine. The rate of seroprotection (subjects with hSBA tit res 1:8) were comparable between the vaccine groups. Study MET57 was a phase 3, open -label (immunology laboratory technicians were blinded to group assignment), randomi sed, parallel -group, active -controlled, multi -centre study in 1200 healthy toddlers aged 12 to 23 months. It described the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of MenQuadfi administered alone and concomitantly with other p aediatric vaccine(s) in South Korea and Thailand (measles -mumps -rubella vaccine + varicella [V] vaccine), Haemophilus influenzae cal conj ugate vaccine [PCV13]). The results showed that the immun e response was the weakest for the serogroup A when the MenQuadfi was administered alone. The immunogenicity data were suggestive of a lower seroresponse rate , with significantly lower GMTs for serog roup A when co -administered with PCV13. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known, but this observation could be considered in individuals at high risk of meningococcal A infection, and consequently vaccination with MenQuadfi and PCV -13 could be performed separately. The results are presented in the Information for healthcare professionals. During the assessment process, newly available results from a long -term immune persistence study were provided. Study MET62 provided information on the im mune persistence at three years following a primary vaccination (in study MET54) at 12 to 23 months of age with MenQuadfi or a comparator quadrivalent conjugated meningococcal vaccine in a total of 91 participants. The results showed an expected decrease i n the GMTs between Day 30 post -primary vaccination (MET54) and Day 0 (MET62) for all serogroups for both vaccines. Somewhat lower hSBA GMTs and seroprotection rates 1:8 were observed for serogroup A in the MenQuadfi primed group after 3 years compared to the control group. There were otherwise comparable or better results with MenQuadfi. For the other serogroups (C, W, Y) a high -level immune persistence (GMT and seroprotection rates 1:8) was observed. For all the serogroups a high booster response at Da y 30 (MET62) were seen. For a detailed, tabulated presentation of the immune persistence and the booster responses, please refer to Table 3 in the Information for healthcare professionals. The safety profile of MenQuadfi was considered acceptable, for de tails please refer to the EMA assessment report (EMA/CHMP/452679/2020).The nature and frequency of the reported adverse events were considered to be consistent with those expected after vaccine administration, were comparable with those observed for the co mparator vaccines and did not give cause for concern. However, for toddlers 12 -23 months of age the safety profile of MenQuadfi could not be fully characteri sed beyond 30 days, as data were very limited. SwissPAR 11 / 13 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 As the amount s of the antigens for each serogroup are higher in MenQuadfi than in the other quadrivalent conjugated polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines, the experience from these vaccines cannot be fully relied on. The safety findings in different older age groups were considered supportive, although d id not substitute the clinical safety results specific for this age group. It is preferable for unsolicited adverse events and SAEs to be collected for at least 6 months after vaccination . In order to further characteri se the safety profile of MenQuadfi i n 12-23 month -old toddlers, the applicant is required to provide further safety data from ongoing toddler studies with a 6 - month safety follow -up period ( post-approval requiremen t). Overall, the submitted clinical documentation on the immunogenicity and safety of MenQuadfi with the additionally provided study results and the post -approval requirement s were considered appropriate to support the approval for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older, against invasive meningococc al disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y.

Product information for human medicinal products 1 / 21 This medicin al product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected new or serious adverse reactions. See the \"Undesirable effects\" section for advice on the reporting of adverse reactions. MenQuadfi, Meningococcal Group A, C , W and Y -Polysaccharide conjugate vaccine Composition Active substances Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, W -135 and Y polysaccharides conjugated to tetanus toxoid carrier protein. Excipients Sodium chloride Sodium acetate Water for injections This medicine contains 1.67 mg sodium per dose. Pharmaceutical form and active substance quantity per un it Ready to use solution for injection. Clear colo urless solution. One dose (0.5 mL) contains: Neisseria meningitidis . Indications/Uses MenQuadfi is indicated for the active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis of serogroups A, C, W, and Y. This vaccine should be used in accordance with official vaccination recommendation s. Dosage/Administration Primary Vaccination: Product information for human medicinal products 2 / 21 Individuals from the age of 12 months and older: One single dose (0.5 mL). Booster Vaccination: A single dose (0.5 mL) of MenQuadfi may be used to boost subjects who have previously received a meningococcal conjugate vaccine containing the same serogroups (see section \"Clinical efficacy \") There are no data available to indicate the need for or timing of a booster dose of MenQuadfi for individuals who have been primed with MenQuadfi. Other Paediatric Population The safety and immunogenicity of MenQuadfi in individuals under 12 months of age have not yet been established . Mode of administration For intramuscular injection only . Depending on the recipient's age and muscle mass, t he injection should be carried out preferably in to the upper arm ( deltoid muscle) or the anterolateral thigh region. To ensure traceability of biotechnolo gical medicinal products, it is recommended that the trade name and batch number should be documented for each treatment. Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients (including tetanus toxoid) or after previous administration of the vaccine or a vaccine containing the same components. Warnings and precautions MenQuadfi should no t be administered subcutaneously, intravascularly or intradermally. It is good clinical practice to precede vaccination by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable effects) and a clinical examination. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following administration of the vaccine. Vaccination should be postponed in individual s suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection should not result in the deferral of vaccination. Syncope (fainting) and other anxiety related reactions can occur following or even before any vaccination as a ps ychogenic response to the needle injection. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling an d injury and to manage syncope. Following vaccination with another conjugated quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (ACWY -D)*, there was evidence of a potential inc rease in the risk of developing Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome based on pharmacovigilance data. There are n o data currently available to assess the potential risk following the use of MenQuadfi. *Not approved in Switzerland. Product information for human medicinal products 3 / 21 MenQuadfi should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of administration. MenQuadfi will only protect against Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W and Y. The vaccine will not protect against any other Neisseria meningitidis groups. As with any vaccine, vaccination with MenQuadfi may not protect all vaccine recipients. A decrease in serum bactericidal antibody titers against serogroup A when using human complement in the assay (hSBA) has been reported for other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. There are n o data available for MenQuadfi. Lower hSBA geometric mean tite rs (GMTs) against se rogroup A have been observed after a single dose of MenQuadfi was administered to infants previously primed with serogroup C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenC -CRM) during infancy. Nevertheless , seroprotection rates were comparable among treatment groups of MenC -primed infants (see section \"Clinical efficacy \"). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. This aspect might be considered for individuals at high risk for MenA infection who received MenC -CRM vaccine in their first year of life. It is possible that in individuals receiving immunosuppressive treatment or suffering from immunodeficiency, an adequate immune response may not be elicited. Individuals with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencie s) as well as individuals receiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation are at increased risk of invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W and Y, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination with MenQuadfi . There are n o data available on the use in immunocompromised patients. Vaccination with MenQuadfi does not substitute for routine tetanus vaccination . Co-administration of MenQuadfi with a tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine does not impair the response to tetanus toxoid or impact the safety. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium - free'. Interactions Injection sites on separate limbs and separate syringes must be used in the case of concomitant administration with other medicinal products . For ages 12 -23 months, MenQuadfi was evaluated in a clinical trial along with the Measles -mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine and Varicella (V) Diphtheria , Tetanus and acellular Pertussis (DTaP) vacci nes, including inactivated Poliovirus (IPV) influenzae type b 13 - valent Pneumococcal polysaccharides conjugate (see section \"Undesir able \"). Lower hSBA GMTs on day 30 post -dose for serogroup A have been observed when MenQuadfi was administered concomitantly with PCV -13. The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. As a Product information for human medicinal products 4 / 21 precaution , separate administration of MenQuadfi and PCV -13 vaccines should be considered in children 12 -23 months of age at high risk for serogroup A disease . For ages 10 -17 years, MenQuadfi was evaluated in a clinical trial along with Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (acellular, component) Vaccine (adsorbed, reduced antigen(s) content) (Tdap) and Human Papillomavirus Vaccine s (recombinant, adsorbed) (HPV). In children and adolescents (10 -17 years of age) , who had not received meningococcal vaccin ation , the immune response to MenQuadfi as well as to the diphtheria, tetanus or HPV vaccine components was not adversely impacted by the concomitant administration. Meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve children and adolescents aged 10 -17 years had no inferior response to PT and lower antibody responses to FHA, PRN and FIM when MenQuadfi was administered concomitantly with Tdap and HPV vaccine compared to co -administration with HPV vaccine alone. Similar results have been reported with other quadrivalent meningococcal conj ugate vaccines. Since there is no established correlate of protection for pertussis, the clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. Concomitant administration of MenQuadfi with other vaccines than those previously mentioned has not been studied. Pregnancy, lactation Pregnancy There are no clinical data on the use of MenQuadfi in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section \"Preclinical data\"). MenQuadfi should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks, including those to the foetus. Lactation It is unknown whether MenQuadfi is excreted in human milk. MenQuadfi should be used during breast -feeding only if the potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks, including those to the breastfed child. Fertility A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female rabbits. There were no effects on mating performan ces or female fertility. No study was conducted on male fertility (see section \"Preclinical data\"). Effects on ability to drive and use machines MenQuadfi has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned u nder section \"Undesirable effects\" may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. Product information for human medicinal products 5 / 21 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The safety of a single dose of MenQuadfi in individuals 12 months of age and older was evaluated in seven ra ndomized, active -controlled, multi -center pivotal studies. In these studies , a total of 6,308 participants received either a primary dose (N = 5,906) or a booster dose (N = 402) of MenQuadfi and were included in the safety analyses. Participants aged 2 years and older were monitored for 6 months post -vaccination and participants 12 to 23 months of age were monitored for 30 days post -vaccination. This total included 1,389 infants aged 12 t o 23 months of age, 498 children aged 2 to 9 years, 2,289 adolesc ents aged 10 to 17 years, 1,684 adults aged 18 to 55 years, 199 older adults aged 56 through 64 years, and 249 elderly aged 65 years an d older. Of these, 392 adolescents received MenQuadfi co -administered with Tdap and HPV, and 589 infants received MenQuad fi co-administered with MMR+V (N = 189), DTaP -IPV-HB-Hib (N = 200) or PCV13 (N = 200). The most common occurring adverse reactions within 7 days of vaccination with a single dose of MenQuadfi alone in infants 12 to 23 months of age were irritability (36.7 %) and injection site tenderness (30.6 %) and in ages 2 years and older were injection site pain (38.7 %) and myalgia (30.5 %). These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. The incidence of adverse reactions after a booster dose of M enQuadfi in adolescents and adults 15 years of age and older was comparable to th at seen among adolescents and adults who received a primary dose of MenQuadfi. Rates of adverse reactions within 7 days of vaccination among infants were comparable when MMR+V w as administered concomitantly with or without MenQuadfi, and when DTaP -IPV-HB-Hib was administered with or without MenQuadfi. Overall, the rates of adverse reactions were higher in infants who received PCV-13 given concomitantly with MenQuadfi (3 6.5 %) than in infants who received PCV -13 alone (17.2 %). The following adverse reactions, as listed below, have been identified from five clinical studies conducted with MenQuadfi when given alone to individua ls 2 years of age and older. The safety profile observed in infants ages 12 to 23 months is presented in the section \"Paediatric population\". The adverse reactions should be arranged according to MedDRA system organ classes and the conventional .

General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Injection site pain (38.7 %), malaise (21.7 %). Comm on: Fever, injection site reactions (swelling, erythema) . Uncommon: Tiredness, injection site reactions (pruritus, warmth, bruising, Rare: Chills, armpit pain, injection site induration . Paediatric population The safety profile of MenQuadfi in children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age was generally comparable to that in adults. Injection site erythema and swelling at the injection site of MenQ uadfi were reported more frequently in children 2 to 9 years of age (very common) than in the ol der age groups. Injection site reactions within 7 days were more commonly observed after booster vaccination in children 4 to 5 years of age (MET62) who were previously vaccinated 3 years earlier in MET54 . The most common injection site reactions after MenQuadfi booster dose were pain (61.9 % in subjects primed with MenQuadfi vs . 71.4 % in subjects primed with MenACWY -TT), erythema (52.4 % vs . 55.1 %) and swelling (38.1 % vs . 38.8 %). These adverse reactions were mild or moderate in intensity. In infant s 12 to 23 months of age, injection site erythema and swelling (very common) at the injection site of MenQuadfi, as well as vomiting (common) and diarrhoea (common) were reported more frequently than in o lder age groups. Product information for human medicinal products 7 / 21 Adverse reactions following admini stration of MenQuadfi from clinical trials in individuals 12 months to 23 months : Nervous system disorders Very common: Drowsiness (18.9 %). Gastrointestinal disorders Common: Very common: (36.7 %). Metaboli sm and nutrition disorders Very common: Appetite los t (25.7 %). General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Abnormal crying (26.2 %), injection site reactions bru ising, rash. Older population (> 55 years of age) Overall, the same injection site and systemic adverse reactions but at lower frequencies were observed within seven days of vaccination with a single dose of MenQuadfi in older adults (56 years of age and older) than in younger adults (18 to 55 years old) . Only injection site pruritus has been reported more frequently in older adults. These adverse reactions mostly were mild or moderate in intensity. Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is very important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions online via the ElViS portal (Electronic Vigilance System). You can obtain information about this at www.swissmedic.ch. Overdose Overdose with MenQuadfi is unlikely due to its presentation as a single dose vial. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. Product information for human medicinal products 8 / 21 Properties/Effects ATC code J07AH08 Mechanism of action Anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against meningococcal diseases via complement mediated bactericidal activity. MenQuadfi induces the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningococcal vaccines Clinical efficacy Immunogenicity The immunogenicity of a single dose of MenQuadfi for primary vaccination in infants (12 -23 months of age), children and adolescents (2 -17 years of age), adults (18 -55 years of age) and older adults (56 years and older ) was assessed in 6 studies . The immunogenicity of a sing le dose of MenQuadfi for booster vaccination (ages 15 to 55 years, participants previously vaccinated with another meningococcal vaccine) was assessed in one pivotal study. Clinical data on the persistence of antibody response 3 years after primary vaccina tion with MenQuadfi at 12 -23 months of age are available for children 4 -5 years of age. Clinical data on booster vaccination with MenQuadfi in th ese children are also available. Infants 12 to 23 months of age Immunogenicity in participants 12 to 23 months of age was evaluated in two clinical studies (MET51 and MET57).

Response in participants previously vaccinated with MenC conjug ate vaccines in their first year of life The majority of monovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccine primed infants (12 -23 months of age) in study MET51 had hSBA titers 1 : 8: in the MenQuadfi group (N = 198) 86.7 % and in Product information for human medicinal products 10 / 21 MenACWY -TT group (N = 99) 85.7 %, each at day 30 after receiving MenQuadfi or MenACWY -TT. These infants had received during their infancy either MenC -TT or MenC -CRM vaccines. The post vaccination seroprotection rates were comparable between MenQuadfi and MenACWY -TT for all serogrou ps regardless of the priming background. Among subjects primed with MenC -CRM, GMTs for serogroup A were lower in the MenQuadfi group (n = 49) than in the MenACWY -TT group (n = 25) (12.0 [8.23; 17.5 ] vs. 42.2 [25.9; 68.8 ]). After MenQuadfi administration, seroprotection rates (hSBA titers 1 : 8) were lower in subjects primed with MenC -CRM but still comparable for serogroups A and W compared with those in the MenACWY - TT group (A: 68.8 % Serogroup Y rates were higher but still comparable with those in the MenACWY -TT group (95.8 % 93.2] ). Serogroup C seroprotection rates were in % [85.5; 99.5] vs. 92.0 % [74.0; 99.0] ). The clinical relevance of these results is unknown. This aspect could be considered in individuals at high risk for MenA infection who received the MenC -CRM vaccine in their first year of life.

Serum antibody response and seroprotection rates for serogroup A were comparable when MenQuadfi was co -administered with PCV -13 and administered alone (56.1 % [95 % CI 48 .9; 63.2] and 83.7 % [95 % CI 77.7 ; 88.6] vs. 71.9 % [95 % CI % [95 in -GMTs A when MenQuadfi was co -administered with PCV-13 (N = 196) compared with MenQuadfi alone (N = 96) (24.6 [95 % CI 20.2; 30.1] and 49.0 [95 % CI 36.8; 65.3]). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown, but this observation could be considered in persons at high risk for MenA infection, and consequently, vaccination with MenQuadfi and PCV-13 could be administered separately. Immunogenicity booster and persistence response: MET62 evaluated the antibody persistence of a primary dose and the antibody response to a booster dose of MenQuadfi in children 4 -5 years of age who had received a single dose of MenQuadfi or MenACWY -TT three years prior at 12 -23 months of age in study MET54 (phase II, study comparing the safety and immunogenicity of MenQuadfi with MenACWY -TT in infants [12-23 months]) (see table 3).
