Because the Fund's Distributions are entirely a function of the market value of Fund assets, growth in Distributions requires growth in Fund assets\". 2. \"However, growth of Fund assets will not be pursued without regard to risk. Thus, it is also the Fund's goal to avoid excessive volatility in annual Distribution amounts resulting from a lack of adequate diversification. The Fund shall be diversified so as to minimize the annual volatility of returns consistent with the pursuit of higher long-term returns .\" Idaho Millennium Permanent Endowment Fund (MPEF) Investment Policy 4 Idaho Millennium Permanent Endowment Fund Knowledge.

Experience. Integrity. Interaction of Three Key Facets Three Strategic Considerations Govern Every Endowment Cash Inflows Spending Policy Investment Policy Investment Policy How will the assets supporting the spending be invested? What risk and return objectives? How to manage cash flows? Cash Inflows What are expected cash inflows? Spending Policy What type of spending policy? What are the spending goals? An asset spending study was conducted in 2014 that reviewed the asset allocation policy of MPEF while considering the stated spending policy and cash inflows. The study confirmed that the current asset allocation policy is diversified and efficient. Efficient means the highest expected return for a given level of expected risk. The study also suggested that adding allocations to private real estate and real assets could further diversify the Fund and improve the expected long term risk/return profile. 7 Idaho Millennium Permanent Endowment Fund Knowledge. Experience. Integrity. Spending Policy The Fund is required to distribute to the Idaho Millennium Income Fund 5% of the average of its month-end market values for the 12-month period ending June 30th of the prior year. With a 12-month spending policy the Fund's objectives may be viewed as competing: Growth of real long-term distributions while avoiding excessive volatility in annual Distribution amounts. -It will be difficult to achieve a long-term expected rate of return of 7.25% to maintain the corpus of the Fund and minimize volatility to reduce year-to -year changes in appropriations. -The 7.25% return requirement = 5% + 2.25% (Callan's inflation expectation) Compared to other Endowment Funds, 12-months is a relatively short period on which to base appropriations. Three and five-year average spending policies are more common. For example, Callan's work suggests a 5-year spending policy helps to accomplish the objectives of improving long-term real growth for both distributions and assets while controlling risk. -A 5-year average spending policy does a better job than the current policy in preserving the real value of the Fund. -Using Callan's capital market projections and asset allocation models this was found to be the case in the majority of simulations and is largely an effect of compounding. -A 5-year average spending policy reduces the volatility of assets available for appropriations. -The longer averaging period stabilizes the asset base used for the spending calculation General Analysis Idaho Legislative Services Office Applicant Packets 1.

The Idaho Academy of Family Physicians (IAFP) was founded in 1948 and is an affiliate of the Americ an Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). The IAFP is the state organization for Idaho family doctors and is the largest medical specialty organization in Idaho. The mission of the IAFP is to: Promote access to high quality primary care for Idaho citizens; Support the initiatives that improve the health of Idaho citizens... The mission of th e AAFP is to improve the health of patients, families, and communities by serving the needs of members with professionalism and creativity. The IAFP coordinates the Tar Wars program in Idaho. The Tar Wars prog ram is owned and operated by the AAFP so the IAFP is appropriate as the managing organization. Tar Wars was developed by a family physician, Dr. Jeff Cain, from Colorado 26 years ago. The AAFP purchased the program for $1.00 after the program grew to a capacity that couldn't be maintained by Dr. Cain and his staff. The Tar Wars program is active in all 50 states and 16 countries. The program has been a part of tobacco prevention in Idaho for 22 years and has grown significantly over that period of time. The IAFP is uniquely positioned to provide the Tar Wars program because of our relationships with our family physician members and other health care partners. We continue to create relationships with other healthcare providers (i.e.: dentists, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and others) to improve the program delivery. The involvement of additional healthcare professionals has allowed the Tar Wars program to be delivered in remote areas of the state that would not otherwise receive the benefit of tobacco prevention program. Please accept our Millennium Fund Grant Application for consideration for FY 2016. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Neva Santos, CAE Executive Director Attachment Idaho Legislative Services Office Presentation Tar Wars Tobacco-Free Education Program Tar Wars Overview Why Tobacco Prevention? Evidence How It Works Success ConclusionTar Wars Is . . . Tar Wars is a school based program designed to reduce tobacco use among students as part of the State and Community Interventions recommended by CDC.Tar Wars, part of a comprehensive tobacco control program Tar WarsTar Wars Tar WarsWhy Tar Wars? TV personality Jenny McCarthy for blu eCigs Hollywood personality Leonardo DiCaprio \"Kids may be particularly vulnerable to trying e-cigarettes due to an abundance of fun flavors such as cherry, vanilla, pina-colada and berry.\" Lorillard, manufacturer of blu eCigsWhy Tar Wars?Evidence In 2012, the Surgeon General concluded that exposure to onscreen smoking in movies causes young people to start smoking. Between 2002 and 2013: Almost half (45%) of top-grossing movies in the United States were rated PG-13.6 of every 10 PG-13 movies (61%) showed smoking or other tobacco use .Surgeon Generals Report 2012 \"The evidence is sufficient to conclude that school- based programs with evidence of effectiveness, containing specific components, can produce at least short-term effects and reduce the prevalence of tobacco use among school-aged youth.\" CDC Studies CDC studies of school programs to prevent cigarette use among middle- and high-school students showed that every dollar invested in school tobacco prevention programs saves almost $20 in medical care costs. The Tar Wars Program Promotes personal responsibility for a student's well being. Mobilizes family physicians, dentists, other health care professionals and citizens to become proactive in their community's health education.

It is worth making time for. It meets some of our Common Core standards as far as speaking/listening as well as using it for informational writing. I really appreciate the time you take to do this for us! Peggy Grunenfelder, 5thGrade Teacher, McGhee Elementary-Lewiston This is my last year with you and Tar Wars, becaus e I am retiring in June. Thanks for all you do for our kids! Tar Wars is a fabulous program! Janet Vann, School Counselor, Southside Elementary-Cocolalla Better send me another Tar Wars CD. I have also spoken to the school nurse for the district about getting the other schools on board (with Tar Wars) so hopefully there will be more to come. As a Family Physician (who also gets into the school on other topics so the kids get to know me) I would have been disappointed to not have this opportunity to speak with the kids on something this important.

Statement of Need The Surgeon General's 2012 report on tobacco and The Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention (CDC), through the Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) outlines t he need for youth prevention programs in this way: PROBLEM: 1. The number one cause of preventable death is tobacco use. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16- FINAL 2 2. Tobacco companies spend more than a million dollars an hour in this country alone to market their products. This report concludes that tobacco produ ct advertising and promotions still entice far too many young people to start using tobacco. 3. Far too many young people are still using tobacco, today, more than 600,000 middle school students smoke tobacco. 4. Everyday more than 1200 people in the country die due to smoking. 5. There could be 3 million fewer young smokers today if success in reducing youth tobacco use that was made between 1997 and 2003 had been sustained. 6. Rates of smokeless tobacco use are no longer de clining, and they appear to be increasing among some groups. 7. Cigars, especially cigarette-sized cigars, are popular wi th youth. One out of five high school males smokes cigars and use appears to be increasing among other groups. 8. Use of multiple tobacco products - including ci garettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco-is common among young people. 9. Prevention efforts must focus on young adults, nearly 9 out of 10 smokers started by age 18. RATIONAL: The Surgeon General's report states that the \"implementation of comprehensive, sustained, multi-component programs can cut youth tobacco use in half in 6 year s.\" The report validates the need for tobacco prevention programs by stating: Prevention is critical. Successful multi-compon ent programs prevent young people from starting to use tobacco in the first place and more than pay for themselves in lives and health care dollars saved. Strategies that comprise successful comprehen sive tobacco control programs include mass media campaigns, high tobacco prices, smoke-free laws and policies, evidence-based school programs, and sustained community-wide efforts. Comprehensive tobacco control programs are most e ffective when funding for them is sustained at levels recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rational for tobacco prevention programs as outlined in the Surgeon General's report is also referenced by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through the Office on Smoking and Health (OSH). OSH is the lead federal agency for comprehensive tobacco prevention and control. OSH is a division within the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and H ealth Promotion, which is located within CDC's Coordinating Center for Health Promotion. Additional ev idence-based research is listed in section IX below. The CDC's best practices manual on tobacco prevention is a resource provided to states and communities by the Office of Smoking and Health. The manual \"is an evidence-based guide to help states plan and establish effective tobacco control programs to prevent and reduce tobacco use. This publication describes an integrated programmatic structure for implementing interventions proven to be effective and provides levels of state investment to prevent and reduce tobacco use in each stat e.\" To review this guide executive summary, please reference the link below: http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/sta ng Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults (2012).

PROPOSED PROJEC T/POPULATION: Tar Wars is a nation-wide, award-winning, youth tobac co-free education program and poster contest. The program is offered, free of charge, to fourth and fifth-g rade students and is active in all 50 states and 16 countries around the world. Tar Wars was developed by Jeff Cain, MD, and Glenna Pember of the Hall of Life, a division of the Denver Museum of Natural History, and Doctors Ought to Care (DOC) in 1988. Since the development of Tar Wars in 1988, the program has reached more than 10 million children worldwide. The program is owned and operated by the American Academ y of Family Physicians and administered locally by Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16- FINAL 2 the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians. It is the only yout h tobacco education program offered at this time by a medical specialty organization in the United States. The program has been offered in Idaho for the past 22 y ears. The number of participating schools has increased over the years with a high rate of retention. Over half of Idaho's elementary schools are currently participating in the Tar Wars program enabling over 12,000 of Idaho's 5th grade students to be reached with this important tobacco-free message every year. With the ever incr easing demands on our teacher's time, their continued support of the Tar Wars Program speaks volumes about it's value and role of importance in their teaching arsenal. V. Project Design The Tar Wars program coordinator maintains a database of schools and potential presenters. Schools desiring the presentation are matched with local volunteer pres enters. Volunteers include fa mily physicians, dentists, nurses, health specialists, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. T he help of Community Partners is also enlisted. Community Partners include all seven Idaho Health Districts; Hospitals including key nursing staff from MSTI; Medical and Dental training programs; first, third and fourth year WWAMI medical students and both family medicine residency programs. Implementing the Tar Wars program requires enthusiastic volunteers and the support of participating educators which have been readily available in Idaho. Once eng aged, the presenters are provided with materials and resources needed to give the 45 to 60 minute tobacco-free message. The presentation incorporates interactive activities which address immediate effe cts of tobacco use, financial implications, effects of advertising, health aspects, image and emerging products. The program is t aught in an individual classroom setting rather than in a large group assembly, allowing for better interaction and involvement of the students. Following the presentation, the students are invited to participate in a poster contest. The Poster Contest is an optional activity designed to reinforce the Tar Wars lesson and illustrate the positive e ffects of being tobacco-free th rough original and creative poster designs. The Poster Contest provides many ad ditional opportunities to impact students and schools. Prizes are given to the artists and teachers of the top 12 posters. With the artwork of the students, the Tar Wars coordinator develops a colorful calendar and sends them to presenters, legislators, the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, teachers, school administrators and IAFP memb ers, further reinforcing and spreading the Tar Wars tobacco-free message. Goals: The goal of the program is to educate and motivate students to be tobacco free; mobilize health care professionals to become proactive in their community's health education; and encourage community involvement and support. By utilizing a community-based approach to mobilize family physicians, educators, and other health care professionals, Tar Wars can accomplish its goals. The FY 2016 goal for the program is to reach at least 450 classrooms in 190 schools around the state. The message will be delivered to at least 12,000 students statewide. 110 volunteer presenters will be maintained and t he program coordinator will continue to develop relationships with community partners intere sted in delivering the smoke-free message. Educate and motivate students to be tobacco free Objectives: The objective of the Tar Wars program is to create an avenue, access, resources and an opportunity for local health care providers to connect with their community schools to deliver a tobacco prevention message to 5th grade students. Tar Wars is uniquely positioned among tobacco-free education programs geared to youth and has been successful in achieving its desired outcome of increasing students' understanding of the short-term, image-based consequences of tobacco use and the de ceptive tactics found in tobacco advertising. Encourage student participation through interactive and innovative activities Enhance learning and promote creative thinking by providing an optional follow-up poster contest Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16- FINAL 2 Cover all aspects of tobacco use including smokel ess tobacco, second-hand smoke and emerging products such as e-cigarettes and hookahs Mobilize health care professionals to become proactive in their community's health education Keep the program cost-effective by offe ring it as a community \"no fee\" service Consider time demands of those involved by offe ring an hour long program scheduled at the convenience of the participants and the educators Provide the tools and resources necessary to implement a successful tobacco education plan At the conclusion of the project, students recei ving the Tar Wars Program instruction will: Have increased their knowledge of short-term health effects and image-based consequences of tobacco use Have an understanding of the financial impact cost of using tobacco and ways money could be better spent Be able to identify reasons why people use tobacco Have the ability to explain how the tobacco industry, advertising, and tobacco use in movies markets their products to children Understand the emerging and trending products in the marketplace such as e-cigarettes and hookahs Understand deceptive, youth target ed advertising strategies and how students are impacted by them In order to assist teachers and educators, severa l of the key elements of the program fulfill the Common Core Concepts of Health Education requirements for 5th grade students. Standard 1: Comprehend Core Concepts of Health Education for Grades 3-5 are defined below: Alcohol, Tobacco & Other Drugs The use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs has major implications in the lif elong health of individuals. Implications include the effects, influences, prevention and treatment of the use of alcohol, tobacco products , and other types of drugs on the body. Prevention & Control of Disease Individuals can have a consi derable measure of control ov er their own health , including the risks of contracting most illnesses. Health-related choices and decisions regarding prev ention of communicable and non-communicable diseases can include recognizing risk factors, identifying methods of contraction and tran smission, as well as the prevention and treatment of disease including HIV. Information should be factual, medically accurate, objective and developmentally appropriate. Reference: Idaho Health Education Standards - Idaho State Department of Education - approved by the Idaho State Legislature If funded, the program will develop a video of the Tar Wars presentation to share with the Lili Web site (Linking Libraries in Idaho). We will also enlist the assistance of Boise State University to help survey students post Tar Wars presentation. The survey will study the effects of the program on student a ttitudes around tobacco use. VI. Grant Management The Tar Wars program is owned and operated by the Americ an Academy of Family Physicians so the IAFP is the obvious organization as the grantee for this funding. The IAFP Executive Director will be responsible for the grant and is skilled in grant management and has fulfilled the requirements of several grants including three from the Millennium Fund. The IAFP has coordinated the Tar Wars program in Idaho for more than 20 years and is an organization with an annual budget of more than $250,000. The association is gover ned by a board of directors composed of Idaho family physicians from all areas of the state. The executive dire ctor is certified by the American Society of Association Executives. VII. Evaluation Plan The Tar Wars program works closely with educators and presenters to determine the needs and challenges of the program. Schools and presenters are asked to complete an evaluation form after each presentation. The input from our school and presenter partners gives them the pow er to make needed changes to the program. Because our stakeholders are part of the proc ess, they have remained committed to t he program and its success. Several of our presenters and schools have been involved since the program began in Idaho. The tobacco marketplace is evolving with the introducti on of new and emerging products. The feedback we've received has influenced us to incorporate lessons around pr oducts tied to the tobacco industry to help achieve our goals of educating and motivating students to be tobacco free. We take the comments and feedback from Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16- FINAL 2 presenters and educators regarding the t obacco-free message and incorporate them into the program. Specific handout materials, parent information sheets, and additional exercises have been created with the involvement of presenters and teachers. The community partners are a very valuable resource for refining the structure and development of the program. Because of the flexibility of the program, we are able to modify the program to fit the needs of each school and presenter in Idaho. Two of the evaluation questi ons we use on the evaluation form are listed below. Evaluation questions: How effective do you think the Tar Wars program is in motivating students to be tobacco-free? Do you have any suggestions for improving the program or the materials you received? How are stakeholders involved in the evaluation process? VIII. Sustainability The program has been in place in Idaho for 22 years and nationally celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013. The Tar Wars Program has been sustained through the support of the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians, donations and grants from a variety of organizations. Tar Wars has only received funding from the Millennium Fund three times but because of the growth and popularity of the program, we are seeking funds from the Millennium Fund again to help provide the program to inte rested school administrators. Over the past 15 years, the Tar Wars program has grown 300%. We have appr oximately 50% of all elementary schools in Idaho requesting and participating in the program. The program's popularity is increasing because educators discovered the benefits of bringing health care providers (experts) into the classroom to discuss the hazards of tobacco use and valuable refusal skills. We are always look ing to increase the number of schools that participate in the program and consequently the number of youth reached. This can be accomplished with very minimal cost. The sustainability of the program has be en proven by the strength of our vol unteer presenters and the interest of educators to spread the tobacco prevention message. Last year, the program reached 453 classrooms in 193 schools delivering the message to over 12,000 students. T he presentations are delivered by volunteer presenters and it is estimated that the cost to pay the over 110 volunteers would be conservatively over $42,760. In-Kind Contributions of Volunteers: 452 classes @ 80.00 per hour = $36,160 110 presenters prep and travel time @ 45 minutes = 82.5 hours @ $80.00 per hour = $6600 Estimated in-kind contribution from volunteer presenters = $42,760 IX. Evidence-Based Research Tobacco prevention efforts rely on an integrated, multi-factorial approach to achieve the desired outcomes. Complementary school tobacco-free education programs are not independent processes; rather, they are interlocking pieces of a puzzle that require repetition and reinforcement to be successful. Each of these pieces alone cannot be the single answer to the problem. Collec tively, however, their tobacco-free messages are each delivered in a different manner, thus reaching and appea ling to more children than one program alone can affect. 1. CDC's 2008 publication, \"Guidelines for School Health Programs to Prevent Tobacco Use,\" - Tar Wars is consistent with the guidelines for youth tobacco pr evention programs as outlined in the CDC's 2008 publication, \"Guidelines for School Health Programs to Prevent Toba cco Use,\" and currently addresses five of the seven implementation guidelines: (2) Instruction, (3) Curriculum, (4) Training, (5) Family Involvement, and (7) Evaluation. 2.

Idaho Legislative Services Office This Page Intentionally Left Blank 1412 W Idaho Street Suite 100 Boise ID 345-5864 Fax: (208) 15, 2014 Mr. Jared Tatro Idaho Legislative Services Office Millennium Fund Committee 700 W. Jefferson Street Boise ID 83720 Dear Mr. Tatro, We appreciate the opportunity to submit our proposal to the Millennium Fund Committee for a grant to support our youth tobacco prevention, engagement, and cessation programs in Idaho in Fiscal Year 2016. Our report on Fiscal Year 2014 Millennium Fund grant achievements is attached as is our application for Fiscal Year 2016 and an Addendum containing additional information. Proven, evidence-based smoking cessation prog rams are a vital part of effective tobacco control. It is preferable, however, to prevent t he use of tobacco in the first place, especially among vulnerable ages and populations that are particularly susceptible to its risks. The American Lung Association has been at the forefr ont of the fight against tobacco use since the 1960s and offers nationally recognized programs to help teens and younger children understand the health risks of tobacco, resist negative peer pr essure and the allure of marketing, refuse tobacco should it be offered to them, and become advocates for a tobacco-free lifestyle. We also offer tobacco cessation programs tailored to meet the developmental, emotional, social, and psychological needs of youth. We propose to continue and to expand three pr ograms that prevent tobacco use among Idaho youth statewide: Teens Against Tobacco Use (TATU), a peer-education prevention program; Support Teens Against Nicotine Dependence (STAND), a youth engagement and advocacy program; and Not On Tobacco (NOT), a tobacco cessation program designed specifically for youth under 18. The introduction of new tobacco products like e-ci garettes, candy and fruit-flavored little cigars, and dissolvable strips and tablets that look like brea th mints, present a new threat to kids' health by enticing youth who would refuse a cigarette to try other forms of tobacco. Now, more than ever, it is critical to offer children and te ens the knowledge and skills they need to make the healthy decisions that can literally save their lives. The American Lung Association envisions a world free of lung disease, and central to that mission is the goal of raising a generation of Americ ans that is tobacco free. We are grateful to the Millennium Fund Committee for its consideration and we look forward to working with you toward this goal in Idaho.

Our Credo 19 We will breathe easier when the air in every American community is clean and healthy. We will breathe easier when people are free from the addictive grip of tobacco and the debilitating effects of lung disease. We will breathe easier when the air in our public spaces and workplaces is clear of secondhand smoke. We will breathe easier when children no longer battle airborne poisons or fear an asthma attack. Until then, we are fighting for air.

Statement of Need Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_ALAGRANTFY16 Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease. Tobacco use pr ematurely kills more people in Idaho each year than car accidents, murder, suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol abuse combined. Addiction begins early with over 88% of adults who smoke daily reporting that they began us ing nicotine before they were 18. In Idaho, 12 is the average age at which a child first uses tobacco , and an estimated 23,000 youth now living in Idaho will die prematurely because of tobacco use. The American Lung Association has been fighting\u2014and making tremendous progress\u2014against cigarette use among youth since the 1960s. The introduction of new tobacco products like e-cigarettes, candy and fruit-flavored little cigars, and dissolvable strips and tablets that look like breath mints, present a new threat to kids' health by enticing youth who might refuse a cigarette to try other forms of tobacco . T hese new threats and the proliferation of false advertising surrounding products like e-cigarettes make it more important than ever to ensure that kids have access to information and tobacco prevention programs. It is vital that we help youth develop the critical thinking and decision-making skills that will enable them to make the healthy decisions that can save their lives. Youth respond well to prevention messages delivered by those they look up to and trust\u2014their role models and peers. And when given the opportunity to put their passion, energy, and talents to work for positive change, youth can be a powerful force against the spread of nicotine addiction. The great majority of teens who already smoke\u2014over 70% of them\u2014say they wish they could quit or wish they had ne ver started. These teens have the best chance of quitting when they can participate in a cessation program tailored to meet their specific developmental, emotional, social, and psychological needs. The American Lung Association has invested years of research, innovation, and hands-on experience in developing youth tobacco prevention, advocacy, and cessation programs to respond to youth's specific challenges. Financial support from the Millennium Fund will allow us to continue to expand and improve these programs and their delivery to Idaho youth. By reducing the number of kids who try their first taste of nicotine and by helping those already addicted to quit, we can reduce the financial burden of tobacco use that is borne by all Idaho residents and improve the health and lives of thousands of Idaho families. V. Project Design We propose to continue and expand three programs that we currently offer in Idaho: Teens Against Tobacco Use (TATU); Support Teens Against Nicotine Dependence (STAND); and Not On Tobacco (NOT). Please see Addendum for a description of each program. Project success will be measured against successful completion of the following program goals for Fiscal Year 2016: TATU: We seek to prevent tobacco use among youth by training teens to provide peer-delivered education about tobacco, nicotine, and refusal techniques to elementary and middle school students. Train a minimum of 8 00 Idaho teens in grades 8 - 12 as TATU Teen Teachers Ensure that TATU Teen Teachers reach a minimum of 11,600 youth with tobacco prevention presentations and activities Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_ALAGRANTFY16 Reach a minimum of 34 school districts, including a minimum of 25 that meet the designation of rural as defined in SB 1165, with a focus on outreach to underserved and higher-risk populations including Native American and Hispanic students STAND: This program will channel youth's energy, passion, and talents to raise community awareness of tobacco's harms and to advocate for better tobacco control policies. Invite youth groups throughout Idaho to apply for one of nine $750-$1,000 grants to conduct community awareness and policy change projects Conduct a youth conference and training workshop for youth representatives and adult advisors from each grant recipient group Provide technical assistance and support and track grant-funded progress and expenses Ensure that recipient groups successfully complete and report on their grant-funded projects NOT: This program will give Idaho teens that are already addicted to nicotine the chance for a healthy future by providing free access to a cessation program tailored to meet their specific needs. Emphasize training NOT facilitators that currently (or are preparing to) work with youth in Idaho schools including those in school counseling, health education, and social work programs at state institutions of higher education Promote training opportunities among target populations Conduct three one-day training workshops including program curriculum and materials Provide ongoing technical assistance and support to NOT facilitators Train facilitators to lead cessation classes for youth in their schools or communities VI. Grant Management Day- to-day grant management will be overseen by Lung Association staff with a combined 29 years of training and experience in program implementation and management. Their oversight responsibilities include training and observing contract program facilitators, conducting program trainings and workshops, providing technical assistance and oversight to mini-grant recipients, collecti ng and tabulating evaluation data, and tracking, recording, and reviewing grant expenses. They will review progress toward targets on a monthly and quarterly basis. Accounting of grant revenues and expenses and monthly financial report reconciliation will be overseen by the Regional Chief Financial Officer. The Regional Vice President of Health Initiatives will conduct quarterly reviews of progress toward grant targets and will provide input on program and evaluation design and fidelity. The Regional Vice President of Advocacy will provide input and technical support to Idaho staff with regard to best practices for youth engagement in the STAND program. Please see the addendum for a breakdown of staff positions, responsibilities, and staff time allotted to this proposal. We will also draw on the experience, knowledge, and resources of our national organization to ensure effective program delivery. VII. Evaluation Plan All programs in this proposal use participant surveys to provide ongoing evaluation. All TATU adult facilitators are required to collect survey data from teens who participate in educator training, from elementary and middle school students who receive presentations from high school student educators, and from teachers in whose classrooms presentations are held, and all data is submitted to ALA. Th is Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_ALAGRANTFY16 formal program evaluation method was implemented in 2009 in conjunction with the Center for Health Policy at Boise State University. The process has established that classroom students gained knowledge about tobacco's danger and gained the desire to be tobacco-free following a TATU classroom presentation . More than 92% of students reported that TATU teen educators gave them good reasons not to use tobacco. This curriculum also teaches youth concrete skills they can use to refuse tobacco should it be offered to them. S urvey questions are designed to determine: Whether the program helped the participants to increase their knowledge about tobacco and its related health effects; Whether the program taught the participants tobacco refusal skills; Whether participants felt the information presented was credible and trustworthy; and How the information presented will affect the participant's decision to use or not use tobacco. STAND participants complete evaluations at the conclusion of their initial training workshop and at the conclusion of their grant-funded activities, with results used to further refine and improve the program. NOT adult facilitators complete surveys following training and are required to collect and submit survey data from all youth participants. We will use the information gained from these surveys to ensure that program content and facilitator training includes information needed to meet youth's changing needs. At the end of the program, we will meet with youth representatives, school personnel, medical providers, and American Lung Association staff to ensure that stakeholders have the opportunity to review yearlong survey data and make recommendations for how the program is adapted for ongoing use to ensure its continued effectiveness. VIII. Sustainability The American Lung Association is dedicated to being good stewards of our funders' resources, and we have over 100 years of experience in doing so . We are supported through corporate and private donations, foundation grants, and special events, along with significant value provided by in-kind volunteers and donations. We provide TATU and STAND as a free service to schools and community groups, and we propose to offer NOT facilitator training free of charge as well. While demand for these programs in Idaho schools continues to grow, the limitations on schools' resources mean that it is unlikely these programs will become self-supporting. The intent of the Master Settlement Agreement is to help future generations remain tobacco free as well as to assist those who are current tobacco users to quit. Millennium Fund support for our programs in FY16 will enable us to continue building the momentum and impact of these programs, and is vital to sustaining them in Idaho. IX. Evidence-Based Research 1. Not On Tobacco (NOT)-Smoking Cessation Program for 14-19 Year Olds Selected as Model Program After rigorous review by an independent panel of scientists, NOT has been recognized as an effective program by the National Registry of Effective Programs (NREP). Since 1999, more than 100,000 teens in 48 states have participated in the program with about 1 in 6 participants quitting as a result.

Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon General The 2012 Surgeon General's Report indicates that school-based programs with evidence of effectiveness, containing specific components, can produce at least short-term effects and reduce the prevalence of tobacco use among school-aged youth. Such components include interactive delivery methods and teaching refusal skills, both of which are included in this project proposal. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Best Practices User Guide: Youth Engagement-State and Community Interventions The CDC's 2010 Best Practices User Guide indicates that youth engagement is successful in preventing tobacco use when it is used as counter-marketing and media advocacy, as social norm change, as a community and school approach, and/or when it involves local policy work. These successful indicators are woven throughout the American Lung Association in Idaho's proposed Teens Against Tobacco Use, Not On Tobacco, and STAND programs.

Description of Proposed Programs: TATU : Teens Against Tobacco Use is an American L ung Association school-based prevention program that has trained more than 5,000 teens to reach more than 90,000 individuals in Idaho since 2004. Idaho Lung Association staff train adult program facilitators and work with them to conduct TATU teen trainings in high school, junior high, and community settings. During each one-day training, TATU teen participants are given the knowledge base, skills, and demonst ration techniques to craft creative and engaging presentations for students in grades 4 through 7. Addendum: American Lung Association Proposal FY Lung Association: Addendum Page 3 The TATU Teen Educators make cla ssroom presentations lasting approx imately 45 minutes that include a variety of hands-on activities to teach children the threat that tobacco poses to their health, along with awareness of how marketing, movies, social media, and peer pressure work to influence them, and how they can make independent decisions that are in thei r own best interest. Young students learn life-saving facts and practice refusal skills in a fun and non-threateni ng setting. TATU educati onal outreach may also take the form of health fairs and community awar eness activities. The American Lung Association provides coordination and technical support to impl ement TATU presentations, conducts observations to ensure program fidelity and integrity, and disseminates and collects evaluation forms at each training and presentation to support program evaluation. Particular effort is made to reach underserved populations that have proportionately higher ra tes of tobacco use, and the progra m includes customized manuals for both Latino and Native American communities. We ty pically experience high demand for TATU in rural areas and small towns, where there is both higher ne ed and less access to tobacco prevention resources, and we propose to engage with a minimum of 25 school di stricts that fit the defin ition of \"rural\" in the 2015-2016 school year. STAND: The tobacco industry spends over $100,000 per day in Idaho to sell its addictive products, and STAND seeks to counter this messaging. The Cent ers for Disease Control cites youth advocacy and engagement programs as a best practice tobacco prevention method. STAND has fostered leadership and civic involvement in twenty-five youth groups th roughout Idaho in the four years we have conducted the program. With American Lung Association trai ning, technical support, and resources provided through $750-1,000 mini-grants, these teens conduct projects to raise awareness in their communities of the consequences of tobacco use while working with and influencing decision makers to make positive policy changes. From advocating for smoke-free parks in Meridi an to working with city councils in Post Falls, Coeur d'Alene, and Hayden to pass Idaho's first ordinance s prohibiting the sale of electronic cigarettes to minors, to persuading the management of Soldier Mount ain Ski Resort to designate smoke-free areas at the resort, these young citizen-leaders have m ade impressive achievements since the program's inception in 2010, and continue to do so. Last year ST AND projects included work to create a smoke-free city park in St. Maries, and work with school and community leaders in Emmett to rewrite the school's tobacco policy to include all forms of tobacco products including e-cigarettes. In FY16, we propose to offer nine STAND grants of $750-1,000 each to youth groups throughout the state, along with a training workshop, ongoing technical support and an end-of-year conference to share results. Grant applications and project reports will be evaluat ed by a grants committee compris ed of American Lung Association staff, tobacco control community partners, and youth tobacco c ontrol advocates. NOT: Many teens who are daily smokers report that they wish they had never started and express a desire to quit. Yet programs that are designed for adul t smokers often don't fit the social, emotional, and developmental needs of young people. NOT is a nati onally recognized smoking cessation program for smokers under the age of 18 that was developed by the American Lung Association to address youth's specific needs. In FY16, we propose to offer no-cost NOT facilitator training to equip adults working with youth to lead cessation classes for teens who want to quit. Designed primarily as a volunteer program, NOT also includes a component that can be used as an alternative to suspension, making it adaptable to the needs of schools and communities. We experience continuing interest and demand for this program, including from Ada and Madison County juvenile corrections agencies.

Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, and evidence sh ows that the younger people are when they begin using tobacco, the more likely they are to become addicted and the more difficult it will be to quit. Rationale or Justification for Project: Peer pressure and sophisticated marketing work together to make tobacco use a dangerous threat to youth. In addition to these traditional threats, youth today are also bombarded by promotions for new products such as e-cigarettes that are not subject to the same regulation as other tobacco products and that can go as far as to make the products appear safe. This means that our youth are regularly exposed to messages about pro ducts that are misleading and that downplay the serious health risks of using nicotine products. Now, more than ever, young people need high-quality tobacco prevention education to help th em make healthy decisions. Young people also benefit from opportunities to advocate in support of a tobacco and nicotine-free lifestyle, and those who already smoke and want to quit need cessation support sp ecific to their developmental, social, emotional, and psychological needs. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 2 MILLENNIUMFUND_ALAREPORTFY14 Project Summary : The American Lung Association uses three tested programs to help keep kids off tobacco and to help those who already use tobacco to quit. Our approach provides programming that helps youth share positive health messages with their peers (Teens Against Tobacco Use/TATU), gives youth the opportunity to speak out about the dangers of tobacco use and to advocate for better tobacco control policies in their communities (Support Teen s Against Nicotine Dependence/STAND), and gives smokers under 18 the option of receiving evidence-based help to overcome their addiction (Not On Tobacco/NOT). For this grant year only, the Americ an Lung Association was awarded funds to distribute to the Idaho Academy of Family Physic ians to fund its Tar Wars program. Geographic Area Covered: Our programs reach youth statewide. TATU teen educators were active in 29 high schools and made 64 presentations in elementary and middle schools across the state. Our five STAND groups represented all corners of the stat e with students from Ada, Gem, Benewah, Lewis, and Oneida Counties. We held 3 NOT facilitator traini ngs, one each in Idaho Falls, Salmon, and Lewiston, that trained 12 facilitators so youth tobacco users across the st ate would have access to an age- appropriate cessation program. Project Outputs: We met or exceeded each of our program targets for the 2013-2014 school year. Teens Against Tobacco Use (TATU): We trained 595 teens as TATU educators (exceeding our goal of 550), and these teens reached 8004 elementary and middle school students (exceeding our target of 8000). Support Teens Against Nicotine Dependence (STAND): Five Idaho youth groups were awarded $1,000 grants and successfully completed thei r grant-funded projects. Grantees included students from St. Maries, Meridian, Emmett, Malad, and Kamiah. Not On Tobacco (NOT): This program was promoted statewide, and 12 facilitators were trained in different parts of the state to deliver this smoking cessation programs to teens under 18. Tar Wars community partners and individual volunteers shared tobacco prevention messages in 190 Idaho schools, reaching nearly 12,000 students. Tar Wars reaches more students in Idaho than in any state other than Texas. Project Outcomes : As a result of TATU, STAND, NOT, and Tar Wars we made a difference in the health futures of youth and families across the stat e. Idaho teens became effective role models and tobacco educators that shared tobacco prevention me ssages with younger students to give them the tools they need to make healthy decisions that pr event them from experiment ing with tobacco and risking dangerous addiction. Teens that participated in community awareness and education around tobacco control policies not only deepened their commitment to a tobacco-free life, but lear ned tools to help them be active, engaged citizens throughout their lives. In addition, adult facilitators were trained to help teens quit smoking early and ensuring that these services are available statewide, including in our rural areas.

The intent of the legislature in creating the seven public health districts was for public health services to be locally controlled and governed. The districts are neither state agencies nor part of any state department; they are recognized much the same as other single purpose districts and are accountable to their local Boards of Health. The law stipulates that the districts provide the basic health services of public health education, physical health, environmental health, and public health administration, but does not restrict the district solely to these categories. II. Grant Proposal Summary Meets One or More of the Following Criteria : (Indicate Yes Where Applicable) 1. Tobacco Cessation or Prevention: Yes 2. Substance Abuse Cessation or Prevention 3. Tobacco or Substance Abuse Treatment Purpose of Grant : Tobacco use causes cancer, heart disease, lung diseases (emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis), premature birth, and low birth weight. Secondhand smoke is attributed to heart disease and lung cancer in adults. Children and youth are also negatively impacted by secondhand smoke, with health issues such as: asthma, respiratory infections, ear infections and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome often being directly Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 5 PUBLIC HEALTH DISTRICTS FINAL 100914 attributable to secondhand smoke. In Idaho, the smoking-attributable mortality rate is 237.4/100,000 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tobacco Control State Highlights, 2010). Of Idaho mothers who gave birth in 2010, 8% reported smoking cigarettes during the third trimester of pregnancy (Idaho PRATS, 2013). The percentage of Idaho high school students who ever smoked cigarettes daily (i.e., at least one cigarette every day for 30 days) increased slightly from 10% in 2011 to 12.2% in 2013 (YRBS, 2013). The Public Health Districts are requesting $750,000 to deliver and evaluate free tobacco cessation services in 31 counties. The target populations are youth and pregnant women, however, tobacco cessation education and resources are available to anyone who wants to become tobacco free.

Statement of Need Currently, in Idaho, 17.2% of adults smoke (BRFSS, 2014) and 12.2% of 9-12th graders are current smokers (YRBS, 2013). Tobacco use impac ts quality of life in the short term and the Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 5 PUBLIC HEALTH DISTRICTS FINAL 100914 long term. It is a primary risk factor for many chronic diseases including heart and lung disease and many forms of cancer. A primary goal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and public health is to promote tobacco cessation among young people and adults through classes. The Public Health Districts provide tobacco cessation at no cost to all people who want to quit with a primary focus on youth and pregnant women. V. Project Design The target populations for Public Health District tobacco cessation programs are youth and pregnant women, although free services are avai lable to any Idaho resident who wants to participate. Public Health Districts have the capacity to provide tobacco cessation services statewide. With the request of $750,000, the goal is to provide tobacco cessation services to 2,200 youth, pregnant women and adults in at least 70% (31 of 44) of Idaho counties. In addition to classes, the Public Health Districts will utilize social media to encourage class participants to quit and stay quit. The Public Health District tobacco cessation programs are based on best practice methods and are provided statewide at no cost. Participant s attend classes and/or receive education over a minimum of four separate encounters and include the following components: nicotine addiction and habit; consequences of tobacco use; different quitting techniques and therapies; benefits of being tobacco free; withdrawal symptoms; coping strategies; stress management tools; nutrition and exercise; social support; and relapse preventi on. Completion of a program is defined as attending a minimum of four classes and/or receiving four educational encounters. An independent evaluation contractor analyzes participant information and conducts follow-up with participants to assess the reach and long-term effectiveness of the Public Health District tobacco cessation services. This program is critical as few entities in Idaho provide free tobacco cessation services, especially in rural areas of the state. Short-Term Objectives The program has identified three cessation objectives: 1). Increase the number of classes offered and/or participants in rural and outlying areas; 2). Provide ongoing support/education to pregnant women to encourage them to quit/stay quit; and, 3). Incorporate social media to encourage all class participants to quit/stay quit. Long-Term Objective Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 5 PUBLIC HEALTH DISTRICTS FINAL 100914 The long-term objective is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use in Idaho. Target populations for tobacco cess ation programs are youth and pregnant women, although free services are available to any Idaho resident who wants to participate. VI. Grant Management It is the mission of the Public Health Districts to: (1) prevent disease, injury, disability, and premature death; (2) promote healthy lifestyles; and (3) protect and promote the health and quality of Idaho's environment. The Public Health Districts' tobacco prevention and control program is centrally associated with this mission. The Public Health Districts provide services in each of the 44 counties. The Public Health Dist rict Millennium program consistently provides tobacco cessation services to Idahoans in over 60% of Idaho's counties. Each of the seven Public Health Districts employs a full-time or part-time Health Education Specialist or other health care profes sional for program development, delivery and administration of tobacco cessation programs. In some of the Public Health Districts, trained contractors are used to teach tobacco cessation classes. The contractors are paid out of operating funds in the \"professional services\" summary object category. Each of the Public Health Districts employs a Finance Officer or Principal who has fiduciary responsibility for grant management. Annually, t he Legislative Service Office performs on-site fiscal audits of the Public Health District's fiscal practices, grants and contracts. Partnership development and maintenance are key components of this program. Work in some Public Health Districts includes identifying qua lified partner organizations/individuals to provide tobacco cessation services. Staff promotes the program to referral sources as well as potential participants. The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program is housed within the Public Health District offices. Tobacco cessation staff coordinates with WIC staff to assure that WIC families (with a focus on pregnant clients) have the opportunity to participate in tobacco cessation education. VII. Evaluation Plan The Public Health Districts contract with the Center for Health Policy at Boise State University to conduct an evaluation of the tobacco cessation program. Center for Health Policy staff monitor participant quit rates and track the number of counties served by the tobacco cessation program. To obtain information concerning long-term effectiveness of the tobacco cessation program, one and seven-month follow-up phone calls ar e made by Boise State University staff to all eligible participants. The purpose of these calls is to determine the current tobacco use status. Three phone call attempts are made at one month, and five phone call attempts are made at seven months. In FY16, the Center for Health Policy will expand follow-up methods to utilize text messaging and possibly email. These data are used on a monthly basis by the Public Health Districts to track program progress. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 5 PUBLIC HEALTH DISTRICTS FINAL 100914 VIII. Sustainability The Public Health Districts Tobacco Cessati on Program was created in FY 2001, when the Idaho Legislature awarded the Public Health Dist ricts funding to plan, implement, and evaluate tobacco cessation programs in their respective regions. While the Public Health Districts believe strongly in the merits and value of this program, there are no other funding sources to continue to offer tobacco cessation services in the absence of Millennium Fund dollars.

Research summary: Examination of smoking and smoking-cessation histories from 113,752 women and 88,496 men 25 years of age or older who were interviewed between 1997 and 2004 in the U.S. National Health Interview Survey and related these data to the causes of death that occurred by December 31, 2006 (8,236 deaths in women and 7,479 in men). Researchers concluded smokers lose at least one decade of life expectancy, as compared with those who have never smoked, and cessation before the age of 40 years reduces the risk of death associated with continued smoking by about 90%.

Tobacco cessation programs that successfully assist youth, pregnant women and adult tobacco users in quitting produce a quicker and larger short-term public health benefit than any other type of program. Project Summary : All project goals were met, the program was well received across Idaho with strong data showing successful quit rates. For Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, the percent quit rate within each group was 33% for adults, 45% for youth, and 24% for pregnant women. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 3 MILLENNIUM FUND FY14 PHD ANNUAL REPORT Geographic Area Covered: The Idaho Public Health Districts provided tobacco cessation services in 30 counties. Project Outputs: 1. Marketed to teens, pregnant women and adults and recruited program participants. 2. Partnered with juvenile courts, OB/GYN offi ces, Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and subcontractors. 3. Evaluated by the Center for Health Policy, Boise State University. The FY 2014 evaluation report is available upon request. Project Outcomes : 1. Of the 1,712 people starting a health district t obacco cessation program in FY 2014, 1,014 people completed it. This included 426 adults, 418 youth, and 170 pregnant women. Completion of a program was defined as attending a minimum of four sessions. 2. Of the 602 people who quit tobacco use as a resu lt of the program in FY 2014, the number quit was 217 (33%) adults, 285 (45%) youth and 100 (24%) pregnant women. 3. The Idaho health care system realizes an average of $3,390 in savings for each youth or adult who stops tobacco use (CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, April 2002 and November 2008). Financial Statement: Description Amount Total Revenue Millennium Fund Grant $497,800 Other Fund Sources $5,077 In-Kind Match $0 Total Revenue $502,877 Expenses Personnel $279,556 Transfer $502,877 Dollar $0 Variance 0.0% Budget Notes : Personnel Costs: Program Coordinators and clerical staff were employed by local Public Health Districts to implement the program. In efforts to e fficiently and effectively reach pregnant women, the local Public Health Districts also used C linical Assistants for a WIC linkage to the tobacco cessation program. Other Fund Sources-Public Health District Funds: Four local Public Health Districts elected to fund tobacco cessation at a higher le vel. During Fiscal Year 2014, P ublic Health District 1 contributed $1,968, Public Health District 2 contributed $1,663, P ublic Health District 5 contributed $1,418, and Public Health District 6 contributed $28. Two Public Health Districts underspent their funds. Public Health District 4 did not spend $700 and Public H ealth District 7 did not spend $1,500.

Box 1623, Boise, Idaho 83701 Phone (208) 345-9126 - FAX: (208) 345-0379 October 16, 2014 Committee Chairs and Committee Members, The Idaho Association of Counties is pleased to submit a grant request for Millennium Fund dollars to assist four counties in providing support for recovery community centers. These centers are designed to provide those who s eek recovery with a place to work toward their goals with the help of volunteers who have firsth and recovery experience. These centers will also provide links to the resources need ed to sustain long-term recovery. The proposed budget is for $500,000 and would include staffing support for four centers, transportation to and from various activities, indirect costs to help with site utilities, computer programs to track data, administrative costs, and ma intenance of equipment. These centers would be open during regular weekday hours and managed by two paid staff who would manage operations and coordinate all the volunteer efforts. If these four efforts are successful, we anticipate a future request for the establishment of additional centers in other regions of the state. We respectfully request your serious consideration of this proposal. Thank you .

At each site, support for these costs through in-kind donations will vary. Communities have donated a variety of unique resources for each location, including but not limited to computers, phones, rent, utility and building maintenance. 3 Miscellaneous costs include but are not limited to repair, maintenance, and replacement costs for center materials. IV. Statement of Need In the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, it is stated approximately 20.7 million Americans reported having a substance use disorder in the past year. In Idaho communities, the struggle of addiction affects individuals in every walk of life. Some people have never sought sobriety before, while others have experienced multiple relapses. Others may have been involved with the criminal justice system because of their addictions, or have been seen in emergency rooms because they lacked the benefits needed to find help elsewhere. When funding for substance use treatment is limited, community-based support is needed for people to maintain long-term recovery. Treatment dollars are wasted if individuals lack a local support system outside of the connections that helped fuel their addictions. Peers in a central location with experience navigating recovery will provide this needed support at Recovery Community Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 6 MILLENNIUM FUND GRANT - FY16 OCT. 2014 Centers, whether it is to an individual exiting incarceration or finishing treatment for the first time, or someone feeling uncertain about their long-term recovery for the first time in years. When people lack the resources to seek help for their addictions through traditional treatment and counseling avenues, unaddressed addiction issues can often lead to costly encounters with local/county law enforcement and/or trips to the emergency room with nothing to cover the cost but taxpayer-backed county indigent funds. Recovery Community Centers run largely by peer volunteers will provide a free place for these individuals to talk with someone who understands their struggles and get support and advice for how to begin and/or continue their process of recovery. Centers will provide connections to local social service resources for assistance in issues like housing, employment, transportation and child care. Smoking is extremely prevalent among people with a behavioral health disorder. In a 2013 release , the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) stated that adults experiencing any behavioral health disorder accounted for 24.8 percent of the adult population, but that same group used 39.6 percent of all cigarettes smoked by adults. Recovery Community Centers will provide an outlet for people with behavioral health disorders to receive information and assistance with their tobacco cessation goals. Recovery Community Centers will also provide the opportunity for individuals in recovery to give back by volunteering their time to help others in their recovery, which can be a life-altering commitment and a strong motivation for maintaining recovery. V. Project Design The goal is to establish one local, community-driven Recovery Community Center in Ada, Canyon, Gem and Latah counties. Each center will maintain regular weekday business hours and employ two paid staff to manage the center and coordinate the volunteer efforts which will fuel the majority of services provided . The centers will be open and visible so anyone from the community can walk in, free of charge or judgment, and be met by a peer in recovery asking \"How can we help you with your recovery today?\" The centers will not act as medical facilities, crisis centers , shelter alternatives, or entertainment venues. The sole purpose of each center will be to provide a safe and supportive environment for recoverees to work on their recovery and on activities needed to sustain their recovery, including volunteering to help others in need. A recoveree can be anyone at any stage of recovery from alcohol, tobacco or other addictions. Each center will establish a system to provide transportation for volunteers and visitors without other alternatives. Volunteers can include trained Recovery Coaches and Peer Specialists who can mentor those seeking recovery from a behavioral health disorder, as well as untrained individuals who want to share their personal recovery success with others who are struggling or just getting started. The centers will offer phone banks and computers with internet access so recoverees can maintain healthy relationships with friends and families, and work on recovery-related activities such as resume building and job searches. Volunteers will also establish a phone-based support system to reach out to individuals who request regular peer contact to \"check in\" on their recovery progress. This system will allow volunteers to collect data on recoverees' time sober, their drug of choice, their location, criminal justice involvement, housing situation and support system to provide evidence that may guide the future establishment of additional centers around the state. Please see Addendum 1 for screenshots and an explanation of the Telephone Recovery Support (TRS) system used in Recovery Community Centers established by the Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery (CCAR). Volunteers and staff at each center will build community connections that allow them to act as navigators for recoverees in need of referrals to community resources to help support their recovery. These resources will be unique to each community and the social service organizations in place in each area . They may include, but may not be limited to, food banks and services for families, housing and child care Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 MILLENNIUM FUND GRANT - FY16 OCT. 2014 assistance, employment guidance, and training opportunities. The centers will also provide referrals for individuals seeking to enter treatment for a substance use or behavioral health disorder, based on the choice and needs of the individual. At each center, volunteers will drive the establishment of a structured schedule of meetings that respect and acknowledge all pathways individuals may follow toward recovery. Materials and assistance will be offered to every recoveree seeking assistance with tobacco cessation. Programming topics for classes, training and workshops will be driven by the desires of the recoverees and volunteers utilizing the centers, so they can choose the activities they want to participate in and provide to their peers. All classes will focus on a recovery-related need and vary by center, but could include: Smoking cessation classes Job skills Job application tutorials Parenting classes Community service Resume writing Computer and internet skills Healthy eating/cooking Reading skills Budgeting /record keeping Healthy recreation Paint the Town Leaf Cleanup VI. Grant Management The Idaho Association of Counties will distribute funding equally among Ada, Gem, Canyon, and Latah counties. A manager and a volunteer coordinator will be hired for each center. These individuals will be intimately familiar with the local recovery community and knowledgeable of the local social service and support organizations - including faith based organizations and businesses - that can help individuals in recovery. They will have expertise in preparing and applying for grant funding. The Recovery Community Center Manager will be provided with the annual budget to provide programming, training, classes, workshops, transportation and events. The manager will be responsible for maintaining a balanced budget. The manager will be responsible for preparing a draft of the Millennium Fund Annual Report for review by the Idaho Association of Counties before submission to the Joint Millennium Fund Committee. The Volunteer Coordinator will be responsible for mobilizing the local recovery community and other organizations to identify volunteers who will provide programming and guidance to recoverees. T he Manager and Volunteer Coordinator will identify sources of ongoing funding to allow continued operation of the center past the expiration of one-time Millennium Funds. VII. Evaluation Plan The goal is to provide peer support and services that will help individuals achieve and maintain long-term recovery from substance use and behavioral health disorders. To evaluate progress toward this goal, each center will track a variety of data during operation: The number of recoverees who use the center and their reasons for coming to the center , measured with sign-in sheets at the door of each center. The number of volunteers, and the number of volunteer hours, provided at each center, measured using records maintained by each center's volunteer coordinator. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 6 MILLENNIUM FUND GRANT - FY16 OCT. 2014 The types of programming available at each center, measured using a list maintained by each center's manager. The number of calls made by peers to individuals in recovery, measured using the system developed for tracking peer recovery support calls. Information offered voluntarily by recoverees receiving peer support calls, including: drug of choice, time sober, location, criminal justice involvement, housing situation and type of support system. This will be measured using the system developed for tracking peer recovery support calls. A compiled list of additional programming and services sought by recoverees who visit and volunteer at the center. This will be tracked and measured through informal surveys conducted by the manager and volunteer coordinator with willing participants. The progress of this project will be tracked by monitoring utilization of county indigent funds, reduction in protective custody holds, trends in local and state incarceration, emergency room admissions and criminal justice contact involving people with behavioral health disorders. The centers will also track the number of visitors and volunteer hours at each center and the number of calls made through each peer recover support call system. City and county government officials, and law enforcement, will be informally polled about their perceived effects of each center's establishment, and on ways it can be more effective moving forward. VIII. Sustainability A variety of in-kind donations have already been provided for some of the centers including building rent , utility and maintenance costs; computers ; and phone systems . Existing resources can be utilized to the maximum extent in each community. For example, in Gem County a center could be established in a county-owned building. Volunteer hours can be used as in-kind match for many grant opportunities. Further donations will be sought throughout the center's existence to maintain a safe and effective environment that is not only helpful to visitors on the inside, but a source of positive community discussions beyond its walls. Please see Addendum 2 to review letters of support supplied by local community entities. Each center will prove itself to be a benefit to its community as recoverees who previously may have felt shunned and marginalized achieve empowering long-term recovery worthy of celebration. It will be the responsibility of each center 's Manager and Volunteer Coordinator to work with the entities and private individuals that see these benefits firsthand to develop partnerships to allow for ongoing funding and operation of the center. Additionally, the Manager and Volunteer Coordinator will find ways for recoverees and volunteers to make meaningful contributions to their communities through participation in local charitable efforts. For example, groups of volunteers may be organized to participate in community events to paint homes or rake yards for individuals in need. Events like fun runs or walks may also be coordinated in communities to raise awareness of issues related to the recovery community. As recoverees seek peer assistance and community support through the centers, the number of people who are involved with law enforcement or go to the emergency room because of unaddressed addictions and behavioral health issues should decrease. Because of this, counties and cities should see savings in their indigent funds , law enforcement time and expenses and jail costs. As individuals receive information ab out tobacco cessation and community resources like housing and job assistance, local health care and insurance providers should see a decrease in the number of uninsur ed individuals seeking help with behavioral health issues, and see an increase in the health of individuals who were previously struggling without support for their recovery. As word spreads about the centers and recoverees increase their Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 6 MILLENNIUM FUND GRANT - FY16 OCT. 2014 charitable volunteer work , community visibility will grow and help draw positive interest into the community c ore areas where they are located. This will benefit local businesses and the local chambers of commerce, as well as social service organizations that may seek a partnership with each center. As communities see the benefits of the centers grow, they will realize the gaps that the centers have filled in the local systems of care, and the individuals whose lives have been changed in the process. Support will continue to grow, as will the peer volunteer base eager to help. Most importantly, these centers will help individuals struggling with the disease of addiction reach a place of long-term recovery. This will have on- going, lifelong impacts not only for those individuals but also for their children and future generations to come. These are just a few examples of ways that the Manager and Volunteer Coordinator will be expected to leverage positive community benefits into lasting partnerships and donations that will allow for th e ongoing operation and growth of each center. They will be expected to develop a plan for ongoing sustainability utilizing these partnerships after the expiration of one-time Millennium Funds, so that future Millennium Funds may be sought to establish new centers in other communities in need.

Evidence-Based Research 1. https://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content/PEP12-RECDEF/PEP12-RECDEF.pdf , \"SAMHSA's Working Definition of Recovery\", Published by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), February 2012. \"Recovery is supported by peers and allies\" and \"Recovery involves individual, family and community strengths and responsibility\" are two of the 1 0 Guiding Principles of Recovery listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA's) Working Definition of Recovery. These guiding principles acknowledge the crucial role that communities, peers with firsthand recovery experience, families, and recovery allies play in establishing a healthy foundation and support system for sustained recovery from behavioral health issues. 2. http://whatworks.uwex.edu/attachment/Directoryofeb.pdf , \"Evidence-Based Parenting Programs\", By Stephen A. Small and Rebecca S. Mather, University of Wisconsin-Madison/Extension Issue #8, February 2009. This directory lists a number of evidence-based parenting programs that have been used across the country.

In Section A, Part III Cessation Interventions (page 40), the report emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation assistance to maximizing intervention efforts, meaning the inclusion of smoking cessation resources at an Idaho Recovery Community Center would be beneficial to other intervention efforts in place in Idaho. \"Offering cessation assistance to smokers who attempt to quit in response to these interventions maximizes the impact of these interventions on cessation, while countering the perception that they are punitive.\" Idaho Legislative Services Office Addendum Idaho Recovery Community Centers Proposal Addendum 1 - Telephone Recovery Support Information FY 2016 ADDENDUM 1 Telephone Recovery Support Information: Idaho Recovery Community Centers Proposal - FY 2016 Telephone Recovery Support Screenshots The following three photos are screenshots taken from the Telephone Recovery Support (TRS) system used by the Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery (CCAR). Recovery Community Center volunteers use this system in Connecticut to call peers who have requested regular support to \"check in\" on their recovery. The accompanying statements about the system were written by Rebe cca Allen, Manager of Telephone Recovery Support for CCAR: Screenshot 1 Description by Rebecca Allen, Manager of Telephone Recovery Support for Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery (CCAR): This is an example of our webbased Telephone Recovery Support system. It not only collects data i.e.: demographics, drug of choice, recovery supports, etc. but also reco rds contact history and automatically generates the next date that the \"recoveree\" needs to be called. This system is very transparent and information is entered at the time of the call and can be accessed quickly and efficiently if needed. Monthly and quarterly reports are gen erated and automatically emailed. We call people once a week to \"check in\" and see how their recovery is going. This is a peerto peer service and our volunteers, who are many times in recovery themselves, provide ADDENDUM 1 Telephone Recovery Support Information: Idaho Recovery Community Centers Proposal - FY 2016 encouragement and support. They are also trained to help the recoveree with finding resources such as 12step meetings, food pantries, sober housing, or detoxes if necessary. Our program was set up for ease of use. Some of our volunteers have no computer skills but were able to learn this program with little to no difficulty. The fee dback from our volunteers has been very positive. They're able to \"filter\" the calls by date and time so that no recoverees get lost in a pile of folders. Screenshot 2 Description by Rebecca Allen, Manager of Telephone Recovery Support for Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery (CC AR): The screenshot below shows the bottom tab for contact history. Each time a volunteer makes contact they leave some kind of note that lets the next volunteer that calls have some background on what's been happening with the recoveree. They can either type it or for people that ca n't type there is a drop down with prepopulated notes.

Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 6 ID MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 ACS CAN FINAL IV. Statement of Need Idaho ranks among the lowest in cancer screening rates in the United States (including all 50 states and the District of Columbia): Idaho currently ranks 50th for breast cancer screenings and 51st for cervical cancer screenings. Meanwhile, Idaho's smoking rate has remained consistent the past few years, but is significantly higher among those with lower incomes. Science has shown us that there is a causal relationship between cervical cancer and tobacco use, and a suggested link between smoking and breast cancer . There is a need and we have an opportunity to: perform targeted outreach to some of Idaho's m ost vulnerable women to educate them about the link between tobacco use and increased cancer risk; to increase the number of women getting their breast and cervical cancer screenings, thereby reducing the rate of late-stage diagnosis in the state, which will save lives and money; and reduce the instance of tobacco use among these Idaho women. In the past, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) has requested funds on behalf of the Department of Health and Welfare's program Women's Health Check (WHC). Low income, uninsured Idaho women are eligible for the benefits and services provided by WHC . There are an es timated 27,494 women in Idaho who are eligible for WHC and have no resources to pay for cancer screening tests. Existing infrastructure provides quality screening services, collects required data, coordinates follow-up of abnormal results, provides case management for those needing assistance with diagnostic procedures and facilitates transition to treatment, when needed. Treatment for breast and cervical cancer or pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix identified through WHC is provided through the BCC Medicaid Program. Women enrolled in WHC are also assessed for tobacco use, receive counseling and education about the use of tobacco increasing their risk of breast and cervical cancer, and are referred to the QuitNow tobacco cessation resources. With the changing healthcare landscape, WHC is not in need of additional funds to provide screening services - they need help promoting the program and getting more women enrolled. As a result, ACS CAN is requesting funds on behalf of the American Cancer Society to perform targeted outreach and education activities. The result has the potential to save lives - and save the state money. Susan G. Komen in Idaho will release a report in the immediate future th at outlines the counties with the highest need for breast cancer screenings throughout the state - we will focus our outreach efforts in those priority efforts. V. Project Design Our project has four distinct but connected components that include: 1) Development of small media pieces. We will engage a firm to create template small media, such as postcards, brochures, palm cards, that we c an personalize and co-brand with our local and state partners to educate women about their health and the need for timely and appropriate access to cancer screenings and the connection between smoking and breast and cervical cancer. These materials will also include information about Women's Health Check, encouraging them to contact the program. The small media will include specific, local resources to contact, to learn more and to schedule cancer screening appointments . 2) Partner with hospitals and primary care clinics in five high priority areas in Idaho to focus our outreach and education. We will utilize small media in these priority areas, through targeted Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 ID MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 ACS CAN FINAL mailings, in-person follow ups with patients, community events, all to educate women about the connection between tobacco use cancer, and the need for cancer screenings. Our goal will be to get women screened for breast and/or cervical cancer (through WHC or their private health plan) and connect them to tobacco screening, counseling and, if necessary cessation services. The following counties have been identified as potential priority areas (Susan G. Komen study) - Bonneville County, Bannock County, Twin Falls/Minidoka/Cassia Counties, Gem County, and Payette County. We will partner with the following major hospital systems to implement/execute the project: Mountain View and Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center (Idaho Falls), Portneuf Medical Center (Pocatello), St. Luke's (Twin Falls), St. Luke's and St. Alphonsus (Emmett), and St. Luke's (Fruitland). We would also partner with the Idaho Primary Care Association and their clinics in each of these communities for the purpose of outreach and education. 3) Offer provider education about Women's Health Check, the tobacco/cancer connection, and best practices for cancer screenings. Our goal will be to ensure that all providers are aware of the resources available to their patients for tobacco cessation - such as local classes and nicotine replacement therapies - so that they can convey these to their patients who indicate they smoke during office visits. We will host at least six trainings - one at the beginning of our project, one at the end for evaluation - in three regions throughout the state. 4) Perform education and outreach to women in Idaho who are newly insured in marketplace plans to educate them about their health plans coverage of breast and cervical cancer screenings and comprehensive tobacco cessation benefits at no-cost to them under the federal health care law. Our overall goals include: having fewer Idaho women use tobacco; lowering incidence of breast and cervical canc er (as well as other cancers) in Idaho; and decreasing the number of late-stage diagnoses of cancer and therefore lowering the associated costs of treatment to the State of Idaho. VI. Grant Management This grant will be managed by the American Cancer Society (ACS) Hospital Systems staff in Idaho, Tina Schaal. She will be offered significant support by the American Cancer Society's Megan Czarniecki, state/primary systems staff and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network's Jennifer Poole, Idaho Grassroots Manager and Stacey Satterlee, Idaho Director of Government Relations. An action plan will be developed and executed by this core team. The grant funds will go to the American Cancer Society and be , managed by Tina Schaal. Monthly progress reports will be prepared, detailing action/activities performed, the number of communication/contacts made and the amount of monthly & cumulative expenditures. The American Cancer Society is a nationwide, community -based, voluntary he alth organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer, saving lives, and diminishing suffering from cancer, through research, education, advocacy, and service. A large portion of this fight lies in our ability to reach and educate the public on screening and prevention measures that they can take to lower their risk of getting cancer. Ownership of implementing this grant will be executed by the ACS Health Systems team, Tina Schaal and Megan Czarniecki. They have relationships with the hospital systems, state health systems, and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)/Clinics through - out Idaho. These relationships will be utilized to implement the grant to the fullest saturation in our desired areas. The work will be coming out of the Boise office with relationships spanning across Idaho. VII. Evaluation Plan Evaluation will be a critical component of our project. We will assess whether the increased resources, tools, and partnerships provided through this project result in higher screening rates and lower rates of tobacco use. We will work with our partners at Women's Health Check, the hospitals systems and provider offices in the critical need areas of our state to establish a baseline - then work to measure Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 6 ID MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 ACS CAN FINAL whether there's an increase in education and awareness about women's health, the connection between smoking and cancer, and the need for cancer screenings; an increase in screenings; and a decrease in tobacco use. We have also built an evaluation component into our phone surveys, which will allow call centers to follow up with patients to see whether they took action based on the initial call. All of this information will be critical as we access the project and whether it has achieved the desired outcome. VIII. Sustainability The project and its design are sustainable in the state of Idaho. The project components are consistent with strategies/approaches recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - for the Women's Health Check program, the Community Preventive Services Task Force and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Additionally , this project aligns directly with the ongoing work and mission of the American Cancer Society here in Idaho. W e will utilize the project evaluation to determine the long-term sustainability of the project. If the project is able to increase the screening rates, increase women's health education, and decrease tobacco use in the population that we are targeting, then it would be beneficial to continue the project into future years with adjustments to align properly with evidence-based practices. We may want to increase the project over time to cover the entire population of Idaho, and we may want to expand the language of materials in order to be inclusive of all languages in Idaho. Using the evaluation, we would be able to provide evidence on the success of the project to future partners to expand the saturation of our efforts with the help of more community partners. Some of our future funding might come from grants and proposals to our partners in the community that help with this project, such as the hospital systems. Having the initial project and partnerships would increase the visibility and aide in the proposal for future funding. IX. Evidence-Based Research 1.

The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN), the nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate of the American Canc er Society, supports evidence-based policy and legislative solution s designed to eliminate cancer as a major health problem. Rationale or Justification for Project: Increasing the number of eligible women screened for breast and cervical cancer through Idaho Women's Health Check (WHC) and t hereby, eliminating those with cancer diagnosed through the program from seeki ng assistance through county Catastrophic funds. Those diagnosed with cancer through WHC are eligib le for BCC Medicaid. Tobacco use assessment and cessation referral is a natural progression and intervention when screening for cervical and breast cancer, and a strategic point of education between health care provider and patient. Project Summary : Millennium funds provi ded 707 Idaho women with quality, appropriate breast and cervical cancer screening, diagnostic follow-up and patient navigation. Women enrolled in WHC were Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 2 MILLENNIUMFUND_REPORTFY14 FINAL assessed for tobacco use, received counseling and educ ation about the use of tobacco increasing their risk of cervical cancer, and referred to the QuitLine/ QuitNet for tobacco cessation. Additional efforts in FY14 included the development of a sustainable tobac co use assessment and referral to cessation services evaluation plan. Database and document ation updates were made to begin collecting and assessing WHC client tobacco use and referral to cessation services. This data collection and assessment went live on July 1, 2014. Geographic Area Covered: Idaho census data identified 27,706 women in Idaho were eligible for Women's Health Check and have no other resources to pay for mammograms and Pap tests. Current program infrastructure includes contracts with all seven public health departments, two Federally Qualified Health Centers and one major hospital syst em. The program has agreements with more than 400 health care providers statewide. This network provides access to every county in Idaho and efforts concentrate on reducing barriers for women in rural areas with lower socioeconomic status.

As only a very small number of clients are able to pay for their services, we have to raise the remaining costs of services for families who cannot pay themselves or that are not paid in full through contracts from proceeds from the Idaho Youth Ranch thrift stores, investments, individual donors, and other grants. Currently, no private foundation grants have been awarded for fiscal year 2016. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 6 IDAHO YOUTH RANCH MILLENNIUM FUND GRANT PROPOSAL FY16 IV. Statement of Need \"The teenage years are a critical window of vulnerability to substance use disorders, because the brain is still developing and malleable (a property known as neuroplasticity), and some brain areas are less mature than others\" (Principles of Adolescent Substance Use Disorder Treatment: A Research-Based Guide, p3.). Additionally, \"access to comprehensive assessment, treatment, case management, and family-support services that are developmentally, culturally, and gender-appropriate is also integral when addressing adolescent addition\" (Id., p.22- 23). In surveys conducted by the Idaho Department of Education, more than 40% of 12th graders in Idaho reported use of alcohol and more than 20% reported the use of cigarettes within the previous 30 days. (2014 Idaho State & Regional Substance Abuse Prevention Needs Assessment, p.7, Benchmark Research & Safety, Inc.) . While current studies are hard to find, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2009 that \"approximately 12,000 adolescents in Idaho used an illicit drug in the past month\" and that 6,000 of those adolescents \"needed but did not receive treatment for drug problems in the past year\" ( http://www.samhsa.gov/data/StatesInBrief/2k9/OASTeenReportID.pdf ). While treating substance abuse early is critical, options for treatment are extremely limited in Idaho. Anchor House is one of only three residential programs in Idaho certified as a Substance Use Disorder and R ecovery Support Services provider by the State of Idaho. Anchor House uses an evidence-based treatment model (see Section IX) and provides services to boys, ages 13- 18. The typical youth referred to Anchor House is a victim of abuse, has poor school performance, conflict in the home, poor social supports and is getting in trouble in the community. Most families with boys who need help do not have the financial resources to pay for treatment. Anchor House serves boys from anywhere in Idaho, regardless of their inability to pay. A Millennium Fund Grant would fund service to boys who can't afford treatment. V. Project Design The goal of Anchor House is to help teenage boys 13- 18 acquire the knowledge, skills, and experience to choose a substance free life after treatment. Designed for boys struggling with alcohol or drugs, the Anchor House program offers a healing, structured environment to provide a holistic, research based, best practices approach to substance abuse education and treatment. The objective of Anchor House is to deter at-risk children from continued use of drugs and alcohol, as well as to educate them about the dangers of substance abuse. We will achieve our objective through four key components: 1. Providing Substance Abuse Treatment (includes tobacco abuse) Substance abuse cessation programming at Anchor House takes a holistic approach, providing an average of 90 days of treatment, based on the National Institute of Drug Abuse best practice standards (citation in Section IX). IYR's treatment model is built on the unique neuro -cognitive and psychosocial needs of adolescents as proven through research . Programming includes positive , pro-social peer relationships, parental involvement, sufficient time to practice new skills and an integration of other key areas (e.g., school, recreation) . Each boy participates in a minimum of 21 hours of substance abuse treatment per week. A combina tion of counseling, classes , and group sessions are used to provide education and hands -on experience to help te en boys become clean and sober . The curriculums include : Substance Use Disorder Education class discusses various substances and their effects on the body, the brain and the child's development/growth, including long-term effects. The class includes discussions on the dynamic of craving for substances during the process of recovery. The Hazelden curriculum ( Section IX ) is used in the education classes. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 IDAHO YOUTH RANCH MILLENNIUM FUND GRANT PROPOSAL FY16 Thinking for a Change is a cognitive-behavioral psycho-educational group that focuses exclusively on helping children understand the connection between their thoughts and actions. The curriculum was developed in the late 1990s by Barry Glick, Ph.D., Jack Bush, Ph.D., and Juliana Taymans, Ph.D., in cooperation with the National Institute of Corrections. Substance abuse treatment group uses interactive journals designed specifically for adolescents to improve the outcomes of substance abuse treatment. Developed by The Change Companies, the Keep it Direct and Simple (KIDS) system includes 15 journals specifically created for education and treatment of adolescents in addiction treatment programs. Topics include personal inventory, spirituality, values, and personal relationships. The Hazelden curriculum (Section IX ) is also used for treatment groups including relapse prevention and co-occurring treatment. 2. Tobacco and Substance Abuse Education and Prevention Substance abuse education and prevention increases awareness of the dangers of substance abuse and provides specific skills to reduce and eliminate the risk of future substance use. Skill development addresses issues including impulsive action, peer pressure, and managing emotions in pro-social ways. The substance abuse program strengthens anti-drug use attitudes and norms, and teaches refusal skills, critical thinking, communications and life skills that promote life-long success. 3. Tobacco and Substance Abuse Education for Parents and Caregivers Parental involvement is important at Anchor House because \"[a]lthough it doesn't look like teens are listening after a certain age, it has been found that they do in fact still hear their parents, and that one of the top protective factors against teen alcohol use is firm and consistent parental communications that it is not OK with them that their teen drinks alcohol.\" (2014 Idaho State & Regional Substance Abuse Prevention Needs Assessment, p.8, Benchmark Research & Safety, Inc.). When parents know the warning signs, are informed of the harmful effects of substances, and are equipped with specific strategies to communicate and problem-solve with the family, the risk of substance use declines significantly. The onsite clinician works with families using the Functional Family Therapy model and offers outpatient counseling as well. Our desired outcomes are: 75% of boys successfully graduate from Anchor House One year after graduation, 70% of boys are not using substances One year after graduation, 90% of boys are in school or working Success or failure will be measured by outcomes measured at graduation and one year after graduation. VI. Grant Management A full-time master's level Program Director oversees all operations at Anchor House, ensures compliance with all relevant regulations and is engaged in community outreach. A master's level licensed Chief Clinician oversees all treatment aspects of the program. The Chief Clinician is also a certified Substance Use Disorder clinical supervisor and has been with the agency for over twelve years. Additional master' s level counselors, bachelor's level youth specialists, a special education teacher and contract psychologists and psychiatrists carry out the day- to-day implementation of the program. A Quality Improvement program has been in place for over 15 years. Training for all staff exceeds state requirements and includes a lengthy orientation, annual competency training and weekly in-service trainings. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 6 IDAHO YOUTH RANCH MILLENNIUM FUND GRANT PROPOSAL FY16 Anchor House program and agency policies and procedures are in full compliance with Idaho State Child Care Licensing standards, administered by the Idaho Department and Health and Welfare. Licensing reviews are completed annually. Anchor House received an overall score of 100% on our Clinical Chart Audit and 99% score on our licensure renewal on September 18, 2014. Anchor House received a 100% overall score on our Clinical Supervision Audit on April 23, 2013, and the auditor noted \"I want to thank IYR ranch for the great job and particularly Fern Sargent (Chief Clinician) for her success in achieving a 100% which is rare.\" IYR relies on strong community and state collaborations to successfully implement its substance abuse education and prevention program. Relationships with state organizations include Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Department of Juvenile Corrections, Idaho Juvenile Justice Association, Juvenile Probation Department, Child Protection, Children's Mental Health Services, local Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups, and outpatient service organizations. Locally, Anchor House works with the following community organizations: Kootenai Alliance for Children and Families, First District Juvenile Justice Agencies, Alliance Family Services, Restored Paths, KROC Center, Boys and Girls Club of Kootenai County, Coeur d'Alene school district, and Shepherds Table. Anchor House is only one program of the Idaho Youth Ranch (IYR). Over the last 60 years, IYR has served more than 28,000 kids and their families. In fiscal year 2013, IYR helped more than 1900 kids and their families find safety, healing and recovery. Other IYR programs include: Family counseling and skill building that's flexible to fit the needs of each family, available in northern and southern Idaho. Designed to reunite and reconnect kids with families, our programs help improve communication and parenting strategies to strengthen families. Emergency shelter for kids who've experienced abuse, neglect, abandonment, or who have run from dangerous situations or are homeless. Hays Shelter Home in Boise has been providing a safe refuge for kids for more than 40 years . The Ranch, near Rupert, is a place where kids take a time out from chaotic, dysfunctional or struggling family circumstances to learn important life skills and participate in group and individual therapy to prepare them for a lifetime of opportunity. VII. Evaluation Plan Our primary evaluation questions (asked one year post-discharge) are: 1. Is the child currently using illegal drugs or alcohol? 2. Is the child in school, working, or both? All agency programs, including Anchor House, have a formal Quality Assurance and Improvement system using pre- and post- survey evaluation tools. Data is collected at admission, end of service, and up to one year after services are completed. Indicators include sobriety, academic progress, peer, family and community support, and living environment. Through a quarterly \"quality team\" approach, the entire Anchor House staff identifies barriers to excellence areas and develops solutions. Year- to-date progress in each measured area is compared to quarterly benchmarks and deviations greater than 10% from stated goals for each area are reviewed to determine the cause and to develop solutions for improvement. Clients are routinely invited to be part of the on-going evaluation process. The following are some examples: Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 6 IDAHO YOUTH RANCH MILLENNIUM FUND GRANT PROPOSAL FY16 \u00b7 Anchor House clients meet each week to discuss past week accomplishments, future weeks planning, and problem-solve ways to improve on the programming, \u00b7 Clients (children, parents, and referral sources) complete a formal satisfaction survey at the conclusion of services. Results are compiled and returned to each program for use in their quarterly Quality Assurance meetings. Program staff, executive staff, and the board of directors review data at least quarterly including rates of service plan completion, incidents, accidents, grievances, and outcome data. They generate solutions to address areas of concern and set goals for future review. In FY14 after leaving Anchor House, 100% of the children who completed the program were in school (high school, college, or trade school), and 75% were not using substances. VIII. Sustainability IYR programs have served the state of Idaho for more than 60 years and Anchor House has been a part of IYR since 1993. The Idaho Youth Ranch is implementing a community awareness and fundraising plan to increase revenue from individual donations and from our thrift stores. These two sources will provide the foundation of funding for current programs, including Anchor House, and future growth. We will continue to supplement this revenue with government, foundation and corporate support when opportunities arise that fit with specific objectives. Because so few families are able to pay for residential substance abuse treatment at Anchor House (we received less than $7,000 from families in FY14), our focus is to raise as much funding as possible so that we can offer services to as many boys as we can. IX. Evidence-Based Research The IYR methodology is based on treating the whole child. 1. The basic assumption of treatment at Anchor House is that recovery from substance abuse requires a holistic view of the adolescent (psychological, social, and behavioral). This view of the whole person in treatment sees substance abuse as an outward manifest ation of a broader set of problems and we follow the National Institute of Drug Abuse best practice standards. (Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment: A Research -Based Guide (Third Edition)) . Retrieved from edition/principles -effective -treatment on October 7, 2014). This guide is a compilation of research -based treatment methods covering principles of effective treatment. 2. The other key methodology at Anchor House is the treatment of co-occurring disorders. Hazelden provides a variety of resources on this topic, noting \"[i]t is very common for those who struggle with drug addiction to also have a co-occurring mental health condition such as depression, anxiety disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. A mental health professional is part of each patient's care team to ensure that any co-occurring mental health issues are identified and treated along with addiction.\" (http://www.hazelden.org ) Their most recent study found \"Clinicians referring young adults with co- occurring disorders to specialized care may wish to consider residential substance use disorder treatment programs that integrate psychiatric services.\" Bergman, B., Greene, M., Hoeppner, B., Slaymaker, V., & Kelly, J.

Principal 5: Family-based prevention programs should enhance family bonding and relationships and include parenting skills; practice in developing, discussing, and enforcing family policies on substance abuse; and training in drug education and information (Ashery et al. 1998). Principal 10: Community prevention programs that combine two or more effective programs, such as family-based and school-based programs, can be more effective than a single program alone (Battistich et al. 1997; Spoth et al. 2002c; Stormshak et al. 2005 ). Principal 11: Community prevention programs reaching populations in multiple settings - for example, schools, clubs, faith-based organizations, and the media - are most effective when they present consistent, community-wide messages in each setting (Chou et al. 1998; Hawkins et al. 2009). Principal 15: Prevention programs are most effective when they employ interactive techniques, such as peer discussion groups and parent role-playing, that allow for active involvement in learning about drug abuse and reinforcing skills (Botvin et al. 1995).

(SHIP) is an Idaho based non-profit organization that works to solve issu es related to substance abuse. SHIP was founded in 2001 to provide safe and sober housing for persons in early recovery from substance abuse. SHIP added an employment program called Second Chance Bu ilding Materials Center in 2005. In 2012 SHIP added a campaign called \"Connect the Pieces to Prevent Prescription Drug Abuse\" in response to the opioid epidemic that has hit our stat e and the rest of the nation. SHIP is partnering with the Idaho State University (ISU), College of P harmacy (Catherine Oliphant, PharmD ) and Generation Rx, a group of student pharmacists at ISU College of Pharmacy committed to reduci ng prescription drug misuse and abuse to expand our efforts to promote public awarenes s about prescription drug abuse. The College of Pharmacy has approximately 280 students statewide to assist in the promoting this prevention program. II. Grant Proposal Summary Meets One or More of the Following Criteria : (Indicate Yes Where Applicable) 1. Tobacco Cessation or Prevention Yes 2. Substance Abuse Cessation or Prevention Yes 3. Tobacco or Substance Abuse Treatment Purpose of Grant : ID Millennium Funds will be used to cont inue to promote the following learning objectives that are incorporated with the Amazing Ad ventures of Pharmacist Phil. Pharmacist Phil learning objectives include 1) lock up your medications , 2) dispose of medications appropriately, 3) take Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 7 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16.SHIP-ISU medications as prescribed and do not share, and 4) use only one pharmacy. SHIP has also added health information which includes a tobacco use prevention pr ogram. SHIP has developed a variety of ways to expand this important public health message to include older children as well as the K-3rd grade students. SHIP promotes public appearances including school as semblies, by Pharmacist Phil, aka, Jerry Fee a local musician who wrote and performs \"Lock It Up\", Pharmacist Phil's theme song. Children respond favorably to Pharmacist Phil. SHIP will also partne r with Generation Rx to co-present prescription drug abuse prevention programs to interested schools. SHIP will add animated comics and downloadable coloring pages to the website, as well as print comic books (especially for children who do not have access to the Internet at home).SHIP is also dev eloping public service announcements (PSAs) with Wide Open Productions to be shown on television stations throughout the state. SHIP will also promote Pharmacist Phil and his message through Social Media, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. All print materials will also be made available to Idaho RADAR to assist with the distribution of materials devel oped specifically for children. In response to the campaign results of the Idaho Offi ce on Drug Policy's (IODP) recent Lock Your Meds campaign, we are addressing the issue of what locati on is secure and what is not secure when locking up medications in the home. SHIP has explored numero us options in finding an affordable and secure way for parents, grandparents and others to lock up their medications. Initially, we worked with Correctional Industries to make medicine safes. Both models made by Correctional Industries were cost prohibitive as the boxes were $78 and $83 each for our cost. Fort unately, SHIP has partnered with a company named Innovative Product Concepts to co-brand their m edicine safe with Pharmacist Phil's logo. These medicine safes have a design that allows the safe to be anchored to the inside of a medicine cabinet or drawer. The manufacturers listed price is $49.95, yet households who play the Pharmacist Phil game, complete the pledge and answer the questionnaire ar e rewarded with a Pharmacist Phil branded toy for the child and a coupon or code for $10.00 off the pur chase of a medicine safe,bringing the cost down to $39.95 for Idaho families. The IODP results also demonstrated that television commercials were the most effective mode of communication with 65% of re spondents indicated that they had heard IODP's message with 80% of those respondent s reported seeing the TV ads. The ISU College of Pharmacy will provide the evaluation component that will enable SHIP to demonstrate this program as a possible best pr actice to promote public awareness of the prescription drug issues. Our goals is to empower parents to take actions in their own homes thus making our communities safer by limiting access to persons trying to misuse or abuse prescription drugs. ISU pharmacy students, through their organization Generation Rx, will be SHIP's link to pharmacies throughout the state; encouraging pharmacies to carry the Pharmacist Phil branded medicine safes so that Idaho families can easily access the affordable safes to secure their medications.

The ED will devote 50% time to this project to be paid out of SHIP Administration account. Travel funds will be used to get Pharmacist Phil to personal appearances throughout the state for children's events and school assemblies. SHIP will n egotiate a contract with Jerry Fee, aka Pharmacist Phil for up to 3 appearances per month (36 X $ 200= $7200) Communications funds will be devoted to the purchase of TV air time in Southwestern/Central Idaho, Eastern Idaho and Northern Idaho. The goal is to run non-prime time ads after school is dismissed but before prime time several times a day in each area of the state for a 90 day time frame. This time was selected as it is less expensive, yet is a good time to capture children's attention. Materials and supply funds will be devoted to market ing materials to increase awareness of the Pharmacist Phil learning objectives through print medi a. These funds will also provide the children's rewards that are distributed through participating schools. SHIP will have two consultants for this project. $ 10,000 is dedicated to Catherine Oliphant, PharmD from the ISU, College of Pharmacy to provide the evaluation component of this program. The additional $ 5000 is to our web developer to keep the website updated. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 7 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16.SHIP-ISU IV. Statement of Need Connect the Pieces is a project of Supportive Housing and Innovative Partnerships (SHIP), a local nonprofit dedicated to preventing prescription drug misuse and abuse. The first game developed targeted children in grades K- 3 rd. Currently, comics and animated story lines are in development to appeal to older children with the same messages through both pr int and on the website. Education is critical, for both parents and children of all ages, in reducing the opioid epidemic. The message that prescription drugs can be very dangerous and even deadly if misused also needs to come from trusted medical professionals, includi ng pharmacists, as parents and teens are lulled into thinking prescribed drugs are safe because they ar e prescribed by a doctor and filled by a pharmacist. Data demonstrate that 70% of people that misuse or abuse prescription drugs get these drugs from friends and relatives. A recent study by Partnership at Drugfree. org and Met Life found the following: One in 6 parents believe that using prescription drugs to get high is safer than using street drugs. Twenty-seven percent of teens mist akenly believe that misusing or abusing prescription drugs is safer than using street drugs. More than half of teens indicate that it is easy to get prescription drugs from their parents' medicine cabinets. About half of parents say anyone can access their medicine cabinet. One in five parents report that they have gi ven their teen a prescription drug that was not prescribed to them. Sixteen percent of teens stated that they discussed the misuse of prescription pain relievers with their parents. In comparison, 81 percent of teens say they have discussed the risks of marijuana, 80 percent have discussed al cohol and nearly 30 percent have discussed cocaine. According to the Idaho Office on Drug Policy, one in five Idaho students report taking a prescription drug without a physician's prescription at least once duri ng their lifetime (Idaho Yout h Risk Behavior Survey, 2011). In 2010, an Idaho citizen died every 45 hours because of a drug induced death caused by illicit, over-the-counter or prescription drugs, a number that has increased 250% since 2000 (Idaho Vital Statistics, 2010). This rise is greatly attribut ed to the increase in prescription drug abuse. V. Project Design The Amazing Adventures of Pharmacist Phil provides healthcare provid ers pharmacists, teachers and counselors with an easy way to start the discussi on about prescription drug safety. The trusted healthcare provider or educator hands out a colorful postcard with Pharmacist Phil that has a QR code and the URL that takes the child or adult directly to the game. The healthcare provider or educator encourages the child to play the game. Once t he 4 mini-games are played, the parent(s) is then encouraged to take the Connect the Pieces Pledge with their child. The pledge provides action items that the parent can do in their own home to greatly reduce the risks of becoming an \"unwilling\" drug supplier. Once the pledge is taken, the game collects a sma ll amount of data from the parent (in the form of a questionnaire) to determine behavioral data, geographical region, and preferred pharmacy. The evaluation will also include data about current behaviors as well as an indicator that the parent will or will not implement the suggestions from the pledge in their homes. ISU College of Pharmacy will also track the locking medicine safe purchases as document ed behavior change. The program is expanding to other age groups and using a variety of mechanisms to get the message out to more children. In addition Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 7 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16.SHIP-ISU to the mobile application, SHIP has devised additional ways to get the message out to older age groups. The baseline questionnaire is completed, the pr ogram then emails the parent a colorful 8 \u00bd X 11 Pharmacist Phil certificate with the child's name on it. The certificate congratulates the child for learning about prescription drug safety. The parent is also emailed a Pharmacist Phil Side Kick Card that may be redeemed for a Pharmacist Phil branded toy from sponsoring pharmacies, medical practices and other interested businesses. The game also provides a fun way to spread the message s to their friends and relatives. Partnership and teamwork are also critical components of this prog ram. This epidemic will take a collaborative effort from all components of the community including but not limited to parents, health services, civic organizations, law enforcement, media, governmen t, schools, businesses and churches to create the societal change necessary to reduce the devastation of this epidemic. We can start the work here with health services, educators and parents! Our goal is to educate both parents and children to reduce the number of prescription drugs that are available in the community for misuse or abuse. VI. Grant Management Melanie Curtis , MSW, the Executive Director and Founder earned her master's degree in social work from the University of Denver and has 24 years of post-graduate and program development experience. She has 19 years of housing and homelessness expe rience. She also has 13 years of experience working with persons in recovery from substance abu se and/or mental illnesses. The following highlights Curtis' experience in grant management. Approximately 50% of Melanie's time will be spent working on Connect the Pieces and Pharmacist Phil. Supportive Housing and I nnovative Partnerships (SHI P) provides safe and sober housing, green jobs, training and long term community support for persons in recovery from substance abuse and mental health issues. Supportive Housing and Innovative Partnerships cu rrently has 9 houses in the Boise area. Four of these houses are exclusively for homeless ve terans funded by the Veterans Administration (1 HCHV and 3 GPD). We have two additional houses funded by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development for persons who have been chronically homeless. Our remaining three houses are funded by a mixture of State of Idaho Substance Use Disord er funding, Idaho Department of Correction transition funds and private pay. SHIP, DBA, Second Chance Building Materials Center (SCBMC) is an employment program for SHIP residents. SCBMC accepts donated building materials that have been diverted from that landfill and still have a useful life. We sell these products to t he general public and the revenue is utilized to help fund our rehabilitation programs and paid employment. We have two locations, one in Boise and a new store in Nampa that we opened on July 19, 2013. Programs funded by U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: Previously responsible for the overall administrati on of special needs housing programs for Boise City Ada County Housing Authority and Idaho Housing and Finance Association under the Stewart B. McKinney Act. Programs funded by U. S. Department of Health and Human Services: Melanie was responsible for all phases of implement ation of the Idaho Child Care Program (ICCP) for Ada, Boise, Elmore and Valley counties, under a co ntract between the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (IDHW) and Mountain States Group. (1992-1995). ICCP is a child care assistance program comprised of three federal child care programs. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 7 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16.SHIP-ISU Prevention Programs SHIP has developed a campaign called Connect the Piec es to Prevent Prescription Drug Abuse to bring together the medical community, law enforcement, Federal, state and local government, business, churches, schools and families to work towards a solution to the current epidemic of prescription misuse, abuse and to stop overdose deaths in our community. We have developed and distributed educational materials. We have recently developed a mobile ap plication/ video game to teach children in K - 3 rd grade about prescription drug safety called The Amazi ng Adventures of Pharmaci st Phil. The children's participation then engages their parents into taking a pledge which consists of action items that can help reduce access to prescription drugs for persons seeki ng the drug for misuse. Studies show that 70% of the people that misuse prescription drugs get them from friends and relatives VII. Evaluation Plan The goal is to improve public awareness and knowledge of prescription drug abuse as well as provide information on how to dispose of and secure medications. To evaluate progress toward this goal, the following data will be evaluated: - The number of Pharmacist Phil game cards, containing the QR code and game URL, which have been distributed - The number of children that have played the Pharmacist Phil game - The number of children/parents that took the pledge - The number of surveys completed - The number of children educated by Pharmacist Phil and Generation RX during in school programs - The number of classrooms that order the classroom kit - The number of lock boxes sold - The number of pharmacies (or other outlets) displaying lock boxes for purchase - The number of pharmacies (or other healthcare facilities) that provide lock up our medications information for consumers General demographic information will be collected and analyzed from the online questionnaire that is available once a child completes the Pharmacist Phil game. This information will guide future efforts to target specific areas (via zip codes) that need increased awareness and knowledge regarding medication use and abuse. The project also aims to place lock boxes on display in pharmacies for purchase by consumer s. Currently only two outlets (non-pharmacy) display the medicine safe. Another aim is to develop a best practice with regards to prescription drug abuse prevention. VIII. Sustainability Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 7 of 7 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16.SHIP-ISU The project will continue after the Idaho Millenni um funding cycle. The program will become self-sustaining through the sales of co-branded Pharmacist Phil medicine safes, the use of Pharmacist Phil's likeness via a Certification Mark License Agreement, sponsorship packages and the sales of branded Pharmacist Phil rewards to medical and dental practices, pharmacies and other interested businesses. United Way of the Treasure Valley has agreed to assist SHIP in convening a group of hospitals, health professionals and other related business to introduce The Amazing Adventures of Pharmacist Phil. This program provides prescribers, pharmacists and educators with a low cost and effective way to provide prescription drug safety education and to reinforce the learning objectives with a reward for the children. SHIP has applied to St. Luke's Community Health Initiatives Program to make this program available in the 39 clinics within their services area. The program and marketing materials in English and Spanish will made available to Idaho elementary schools through this grant free of charge. IX. Evidence-Based Research Community prevention programs that combine two or more effective programs, such as family- based and school-based programs, can be more effective than a single program alone (Battistich et al. 1997; Spoth et al. 2002c; Redmond, C.; Trudeau, L.; and C.S. Longitudinal substance initiation outcomes for a universal preventive intervention combining family and school programs. Psychol Addict Behav 16(2):129-134, 2002c. Family-based prevention programs should enhan ce family bonding and relationships and include parenting skills; practice in developing, discussing, and enforcing family policies on substance abuse; and training in drug education and information (Ashery et al. 1998). Idaho Legislative Services Office Addendum http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/lessons prevention research See Below Principle 10 Community prevention programs that combine two or more effective programs, such as familybased and schoolbased programs, can be more effective than a single program alone (Battistich et al. 1997; Spoth et al. 2002c; Solomon, D.; Schaps, 1997.

Psychol family-centered interventions within the public middle school: linking service delivery to change in student problem behavior. J Abnorm Child Psychol 33(6):723-733, 2005. Principle 5 - Family-based prevention programs should enhance family bonding and relationships and include parenting skills; pr actice in developing, discussing, and enforcing family policies on substance abuse; and training in drug education and info rmation (Ashery et al. 1998). Family bonding is the bedrock of the relationship between parent s and children. Bonding can be strengthened through skills training on parent supportiveness of ch ildren, parent-child communication, and parental i nvolvement (Kosterman et al. 1997; Spoth et al. 2004). Parental monitoring and supervision are critical for drug abuse pr evention. These skills can be enhanced with training on rule-setting; t echniques for monitoring activities; praise for appropriate behavior; and moderate, consistent discipline that enforces defined family rules (Kosterman et al. 2001).

Statement of Need Underage drinking leads to extreme consequences. According to the Surgeon General's Call to Action To Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking, the short- and long-term consequences that arise from underage alcohol consumption are astonishing in their range and magnitude, affecting adolescents, the people around them, and society as a whole. While most people are somewhat educated about these consequences, convincing the general public that underage drinking is not acceptable is more challenging than it should be. Abiding by the legal drinking age of 21 is critical to improving the health of our students and the state of Idaho. Underage drinking is both a national and local concern. Alcohol is the number one drug of choice among Idaho teens and also takes more lives of teens than all other drugs combined. Beyond the life- threatening consequences that alcohol brings, Idaho Drug Free Youth is concerned about how underage drinking affects addiction rates in our state. 90% of Americans who meet the medical criteria for addiction started drinking, smoking, or using other drugs before the age of 18 (http://www.casacolumbia.org/addiction-research/reports/adolescent-substance-use ). In Idaho 39% of students, age 14-18, have consumed alcohol as reported by the Center for Disease control in 2011, and 22% have engaged in binge drinking according to the same study. The earlier that young people start drinking the likelihood they will become alcoholic or addicted later in life increases. If they wait until after 21, they only have a 7% chance of having life-long addiction issues. In contrast, young people who begin drinking by the age of 15 have a 25% chance of suffering from the otherwise preventable infliction of addiction. The first step to preventing underage drinking is to change parental attitudes surrounding alcoh ol. While the legal drinking age is 21 to protect our youth, the law is often disregarded by parents and adults who provide alcohol to teens. Despite being identified by youth as one of their primary sources of alcohol, hands down, parents are the most influential person or thing in a child's decision not to drink at all. Eighty-three percent of youth report parents are the leading influence in their decision to not to drink alcohol. (Source: The Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility, February 2012). It is essential that a prudent and active \"21 Matters\" message is confidently and consistently proclaimed throughout Idaho to both teens and adults in order to counteract the flawed thinking and messages sent by alcohol the alcohol industry. The second step to preventing underage drinking is to help students feel connected in positive ways . A lack of school connectedness contributes to an increase in the risk factors that lead to teen substance abuse. School connectedness is described as the feeling by students that their peers and adults in the school care about them. Studies have shown that when youth do not have a sense of belonging in school they are more likely to use and abuse substances. Dr. William Glasser, according to Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 12 MFGRANTFY16 -IDFY his Choice Theory concept says that \"Disconnection is the source of almost all human problems.\" When young people are disconnected, they become vulnerable and consequently more susceptible to negative influences that lead to substance abuse. Researchers have found that there is a need, and an opportunity in schools, to engage students in meaningful interactive programs that promote school connectedness through socially healing experiences that break down walls among disenfranchised youth, and which promote compassion and empathy . As a non-profit 501 c3, IDFY consistently seeks funding to support schools in their efforts to provide supplemental prevention programming. Because of the Millennium Fund Idaho schools can more easily afford i2i Program s for their students and communities. Without this funding, school officials would struggle to initiate and/or sustain the popular i2i Program in their schools due to already strained budgets and fewer prevention dollars. Since 2007 the Millennium Fund funding has directly engaged over 40,000 young people through i2i. In 2012/2013 we personally stood before over 6000 students; the largest annual number since the inception of the program. Prior to the i2i Program the IDFY Staff was only able to directly interface with about 500 students each year. IDFY has earned a reputation of being a dynamically positive influence in the lives of Idaho teens, and in the absence of the i2i Program schools would be in the position of paying much higher fees to similar out of state organizations that do not provide this multi-faceted approach, and which do not focus specifically on substance abuse cessation and prevention. IDFY is requesting funding for the 2015/2016 school year that will allow it to continue to share the i2i Program and 21 Matters with Idaho schools and communities in a cost effective manner. When schools save money they are more likely to keep the program going year after year, which promotes and sustains a drug free culture within those schools. V. Project Design By and large, the reasons that children move from negative to favorable expectancies about the effects of alcohol is due to the clever tactics of alcohol advertising. Dr. Debenedittis has consulted with IDFY as we have designed the i2i and 21 Matters Program. His research has provided evidence that Media Literacy training is effective at preventing and reducing teen alcohol use. Media Literacy is defined as one's awareness of the impact of media messages on one's conscious and unconscious choices. This method teaches adults and teens to critically think about and counteract the influence of shrewd alcohol advertising. The i2i Program is a unique program that combines proven prevention methods with state of the art facilitation services to deliver potent experiences that reshape social norms and instill healthy attitudes toward underage drinking. There are fives components to IDFY's i2i Program: 21 Matters Presentations: 21 Matters is an interactive and youth-led approach that relies on science- based evidence to educate youth and adults regarding underage drinking prevention. IDFY will train IDFY Facilitators and youth teams to present 21 Matters throughout Idaho communities. 21 Matters is a Media Literacy awareness program that highlights the number one predictor of teen alcohol use, and which utilizes an effective approach to reducing it. 21 Matters presentation teams will present to community forums, youth programs (boy/girl scouts, 4H programs, PTO/PTA groups, Boys and Girls Clubs, etc), and school health classrooms and /or assemblies. Teams of 5-10 youth facilitators will be recruited from high schools and middle schools and will be trained during a 2.5-3 hour training directly after school following i2i Student Assemblies. These teams will be trained in Media Literacy and will learn how to share the 21 Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 12 MFGRANTFY16 -IDFY Matters presentation. IDFY's Director of Outreach will provide a comprehensive training, promotion, and follow up program to support students and increase their success. IDFY Facilitators will also be instrumental in delivering 21 Matters and may provide in person support to youth presenters when affordable and possible. Youth teams will be accompanied by at least one school advisor/personnel. 21 Matters Goals: 1. Influence adults and community members to commit to the belief that preventing alcohol use until after the age of 21 matters. 2. Challenge youth to make personal commitments to avoid drugs and alcohol. 3. Train teams of teenagers who serve as community spokespersons who educate their peers and communities regarding underage drinking prevention. 21 Matters Objectives: 1. Empower 30 21 Matters Teen Presentation Teams with the means and knowledge to present the 21 Matters material within their communities. 2. Reach out to and schedule 21 Matters presentations with community groups that are on-going rather than being restricted to one community forum that attempts to draw just one crowd . 3. Deliver 21 Matters to at least 60 audiences state-wide. 4. Provide additional take home resources that participants can use to recall information following presentation and use to share with friends and neighbors. Projected Outcomes: 1. Student leaders will become confident community spokespersons and prevention advocates. 2. Students will be able to articulate principles of evidence-based Media Literacy education to youth and adult audiences alike. 3. Adult community members will become more committed to preventing underage drinking. 4. 21 Matters participants (youth and adults) will be able to critically counteract alcohol advertising that promotes favorable alcohol expectancies. 5. 21 Matters participants will learn the short and long range consequences of underage drinking and be able to articulate that message in a compelling manner. i2i Student Assemblies: The i2i Student Assembly is a powerfully engaging experience that captures students' attention, creates meaningful connection across cliques and student groups, introduces life lessons that reduce risky behavior, and challenges young people to make wise decisions for themselves while improving environmental social norms that have been proven to increase protective factors. These sessions develop a mutual sense of support, contribute to a sense of school connectedness, and motivate students to embrace the challenge to resist drugs and alcohol. i2i Student Assemblies are tailored to fit audiences across age levels. 5th and 6th grade programs are designed for 2.5 hours. 7th and 8th grade programs are typically three hours. This format allows us to reach more students and facilitate two programs within one school day. While some high schools choose the three hour format with a goal to involve more students, other programs last up to six hours which allows for deeper content penetration. Each program's format is designed to fit the goals of each individual school. i2i Student Assemblies Goals: 1. Enhance school connectedness. 2. Unite disenfranchised groups and increase peer to peer support. 3. Inspire students to resist substance abuse and establish positive peer norms regarding underage drinking . 4. Reduce the number of students who turn to alcohol use because of isolation and disconnection. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 12 MFGRANTFY16 -IDFY i2i Student Assemblies Objectives: 1. Engage every participating student intellectually, physically, and emotionally. 2. Include school staff members in each assembly so they can support student commitments beyond the i2i experience. 3. Break down walls, labels, and student misconceptions through experiential activities and meaningful small group discussions. 4. Use humor, fun activities, and laughter to help students experience and embrace program content in memorable and meaningful ways. 5. Close each student assembly with students verbalizing what they learned and how they are going to apply those lessons beyond the session. Projected Outcomes: 1. IDFY facilitators will personally engage and inspire 7500+ teenagers across Idaho in i2i Student Assemblies within the 2015/2016 school year. 2. Students will become more compassionate and understanding of the struggles and issues that their peers face, which enhances peer support. 3. Students will learn to seek help for their challenges rather than turning to alcohol and drugs for relief. 4. Students will learn and experience the caring nature of school staff and become more connected to the school. 5. Students will help each other live out their commitments and challenge each other to make positive changes in the school and their lifestyles. 6. School environments will become more positive. Bullying, victimizing, and hurtful behaviors will be countered with empathy, caring and peer support. 7. Students will make personal commitments to be substance free and communicate them at the conclusion of each i2i Student Assembly. 21 Matters Print , Social Media, and Billboard Campaign: With the use of print media we will counter the alcohol advertising's influence for community members who do not attend 21 Matters Presentations . We will use newspaper inserts, press releases, community posters, flyers and postcards delivered by IDFY Chapter students in their communities, as well as a compelling and socially relevant social media strategy. Billboards will be used in # of counties to led the general public to the 21 Matters website where they can gain access to further education and presentation locations. 21 Matters Campaign Goal: 1. Provide educational material and messaging that is compelling and relevant and helps Idaho residents understand and respond to the need to reduce underage drinking. 21 Matters Campaign Objectives: 1. Establish relationships with community partners to deliver 21 Matters Campaign materials into the homes of community members. 2. Use newspaper press releases promote 21 Matters presentations and messaging. 3. Create attractive billboard messaging that compels community members to action. 4. Create partnerships with Community Coalitions and community minded organizations to host 21 Matters Presentations Projected Outcomes: 1. 21 Matters will reach a large audience through the print media and the social media influence. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 7 of 12 MFGRANTFY16 -IDFY 2. Idaho community members will be exposed to the 21 Matters Campaign and will redefine their commitment to the legal drinking age and the need to prevent underage drinking. 21 Matters Take Home Materials: Each 21 Matters participant will receive materials to use for their own educational recall and purposes following the 21 Matters Presentation. 21 Matters Take Home Materials Goal: 1. Empower presentation attendees to share the 21 Matters materials with friends and community members. 21 Matters Take Home Materials Objectives: 1. Create compelling and easy to use materials for participants to share. 2. Ensure that every participant who attends a 21 Matters presentation receives and knows how to use the program materials. 3. Persuade and challenges attendees to list out friends and neighbors with whom they will share the 21 Matters materials. Projected Outcomes: 1. 21 Matters participants will appreciate the education they receive and evaluate those in their lives who need to hear that information. 2. Adults will appreciate the value of the legal drinking age and expose their friends and neighbors to the information. IDFY i2i and 21 Matters Facilitator Certification: IDFY will train and mobilize additional facilitators that are certified by IDFY to facilitate and present the i2i Program. This training will be conducted in two phases: the First phase will provide prospective facilitators with skills to connect with one's audience, present meaningful and relevant content in an effective manner that motivates learning, and processing techniques to help participants reflect and apply the intended lessons. The second phase will expose facilitators to live i2i Student Assembly and 21 Matters audiences where they will have the chance to practice their skills under the supervision of IDFY's Director of Outreach. Facilitators will become certified when they have effectively facilitated each component of the i2i Program. Once certified, IDFY Facilitators will serve as contractors to provide leadership for i2i Programs across the state. Facilitator Certification Goals: 1. Expand the IDFY Facilitation Team. 2. Increase the number of i2i Programs that can be scheduled through the state. 3. Increase the number of students who can be engaged through i2i in 2015-2016 to 7500. Facilitator Certification Objectives: 1. To increase the number of i2i Student Assemblies and 21 Matters Presentations that IDFY is able to facilitate with a goal of at least 45 schools throughout the state. 2. To facilitate 80% of the i2i Programs before the end of November when the ability to impact school connectedness is most effectual. 3. Directly engage 7500 students in 2015-2016. Projected Outcomes: 1. School officials will appreciate that IDFY is able to schedule their i2i Program closer to the beginning of the school year. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 8 of 12 MFGRANTFY16 -IDFY 2. Schools will benefit from a more positive climate, drug prevention messaging, and established social norms earlier than previous years. 3. The 21 Matters message will become a well known brand that peaks the curiosity of the general public. 4. The general public will engage with and be inspired to join in the 21 Matters message. The new 21 Matters format combines IDFY's current practices with a new method that recruits and mobilizes teams of students to be prevention advocates in their own communities. The goal is to increase the number of audiences that hear the 21 Matters message, which will subsequently increase the number of participants who attend. 21 Matters will be seen in elementary schools, community forums (PTO/PTA organizations, civic groups, etc), as well as youth groups such as 4H or Boy/Girl Scout Troops. The success of each component will be measured through program evaluation. A 15 question survey will help us to know how successful we were in educating participants, and will also measure how effective the promotion methods were in compelling community members to attend. Student participant in an i2i Student Assembly will receive an i2i Survey to be completed with parental assistance following the program and submitted to IDFY physically, or electronically through our website. We will add incentive for students to submit their surveys by entering them in a drawing to win a full Idaho Youth Summit registration. The survey will help us know what students learned as a result of their i2i experience, and how to improve the program's effectiveness. VI. Grant Management Idaho Drug Free Youth is a solid contributor to Idaho's prevention efforts. As a 501c3 non-profit since 1991 , IDFY has provided and deliver ed po werful youth programs and experiences through IDFY Chapters in over 70 Idaho schools, leadership retreats, state-wide youth conferences (Idaho Yo uth Summit), school based leadership and mentoring programs (VOICE Student to Student Mentoring Program), and i2i Programs. Our 12-member board of directors includes community leaders in health, banking, law, education, counseling, insurance, and law enforcement. IDFY's Board provides input and support to guide the organization and its programs. Each year youth from each of Idaho's seven regions apply and are selected to IDFY's Youth Advisory Board (YAB). The YAB members provide valuable input for IDFY's programming and serve as ambassadors to their region 's Chapters. There are more than 3,000 middle and high school students who are active IDFY card carrying members statewide. We empower these students to organize and present drug, alcohol and tobacco prevention programs in their schools and communities. Our statewide office in Coeur d'Alene is currently staffed by 3 full time staff, and two part time staff. This staff oversees all operations statewide including implementation of all programs and managing over 100 volunteers. IDFY's Executive Director Greg Sommers will provide the primary management of this grant. Greg will supervise all staff who work on Millennium grant-funded programs. Greg joined the IDFY staff in August of 2009 as the Director of Outreach and has been a key factor in helping create, revise, and deliver all i2i Program components. Greg earned a B.S. in Social Work at Lewis & Clark State College. Idaho Drug Free Youth's Director of Marketing and Promotions, Kelsey Wood, earned her B.S. in psychology at University of Idaho. In high school she was a member of an Idaho Drug Free Youth Chapter. Kelsey oversees promoting i2i and working with schools and advisors to develop and grow IDFY's Chapter Program. She also manages all outside communication and social media campaigning. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 9 of 12 MFGRANTFY16 -IDFY She will coordinate and oversee i2i direct marketing, print and program materials, event logistics, and manage our media campaign. IDFY's Director of Outreach, Mindy Meyer earned her Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration from the University of Idaho. She is the primary contact with schools to schedule, manage, coordinate, and facilitate i2i School Assemblies and 21 Matters Trainings and Presentations. Mindy serves as the IDFY Lead Facilitator and will manage and coordinate IDFY Facilitators. Mindy works with the Administrative Assistant to ensure that \u00ed2i Program r equests are responded to quickly and efficiently. Corey Crownhart is IDFY's Program Director. His primary responsibilities include planning and overseeing IDFY's leadership training retreats, the Idaho Youth Summit, and fund raising means to grow and sustai n IDFY's funding base. He will utilize his program analysis experience and long-term program strategy skills to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the i2i Program. Corey earned a BS in Political Science from Boise State University. Karen Ashenbrenner is IDFY's Administrative Assistant who will be the first point of contact who receives and responds to initial requests as she hands off the program details to the Director of Outreach. Staff time: Greg Sommers = 0.20 , Mindy Meyer = 0.85, Kelsey Wood = 0.75, Corey Crownhart = 0.20 Administrative Assistant = .15 VII. Evaluation Plan Each participant will complete a 15 question pre/post survey at each 21 Matters Presentation. This survey will include a Likert scale measuring system with \"1\" valued low, and \"5\" valued high, along with open- ended questions to measure understanding on key program elements. We specifically want to know: - What part of tonight's presentation did you find most meaningful/helpful? - After attending this program, do you feel prepared to discuss difficult topics, such as alcohol use, with family members? - Do you plan to change any of your current behaviors based on the program's message? If yes, what will be different? o Responses in the past have been: \"Really talking about how they are exposed to alcohol ads and such. I will talk more about the consequences.\" \"I will help my kids \"talk back\" to alcohol advertisements.\" \"I will tell my friends to stop using alcohol (from a 13 year old).\" \"My response to advertising. I didn't realize their impact.\" \"I won't drink with my kids anymore during camping trips.\" We expect to receive a high participation rate with the survey because participants are asked to complete their responses during the program and submit them as they exit. We will complete a statistical assessment of 21 Matters participants' pre and post program survey data to assess knowledge gains and behavior changes. Our goal is to compare our results to the research that has shown program effectiveness and look for commonalities and affirmation that the 21 Matters is producing the same or similar results. We want to ensure that i2i Student Assemblies and 21 Matters are meeting program goals and objectives. An evaluation analysis will help us assess the impact of 21 Matte rs as well as our media campaigning to help guide the efficient use of future resources to promote the i2i Program. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 10 of 12 MFGRANTFY16 -IDFY i2i Student Assembly effectiveness will be evaluated in two ways. 1. i2i School Coordinator feedback. 2. Student responses. i2i Student Assembly Coordinators will be asked the following: - In your opinion, was the program helpful for your students? Was it helpful for the school? o Responses include: The most recent response was from Marsh Valley High School, \"The i2i Program was... so beneficial for them. They saw students that they needed to get extra attention and make sure they ke ep their ears and eyes open for them in the halls. Plus many said wow, we now have more friends!\" o \"i2i was so great for our school. Students are taking care of each other and we have less bullying going on. Can't wait for next time.\" - What part of the program was especially helpful? o Selected responses are: \"Students are more compassionate and understanding of their peers.\" \"We saw walls break down between students.\" \"The team building component is particularly valuable. Rather than just talking about helping each other, they have to do it. That's when they get it.\" - Would you like to have i2i return to your school next year? o Selected responses are: \"Yes, if we have funding.\" \"Absolutely, we just want to do it sooner in the year.\" \"Without a doubt.\" In 2014/2015 we will ask students to respond to the following questions as part of our take home survey: - What did you learn during your i2i Student Assembly experience? - Will the i2i experience influence teens in your school to be alcohol and drug free? If yes, how so: - In your opinion, how will students in your school benefit from participating in the i2i? - What was the best part of the program? - What would you change about the program? VIII. Sustainability In 2007, Millennium Fund funding was originally requested to support an effort to educate Idaho parents of the consequences of underage drinking and the need to prevent it. Since then, the i2i Program has expanded and become a staple for schools due to its student empowerment piece, along with the underage drinking emphasis . The good news is that they want the program, the bad news is that in 20 09/2010 schools lost their lost their Safe and Drug Free Schools funds. Our attempt to find a way to sustain the program, while also addressing schools' budget restraints led to an effort last year create a rotating fee structure. The fee structure meets multiple goals by: 1. Directing the majority of the Millennium Fund funding to first year schools. 2. Increasing ownership on schools to invest in their own outcomes and purposes for i2i. 3. Stretching Millennium Fund funding to increase the number of i2i Programs each year.. 4. Keeping costs affordable for schools who are seeking dynamic and creative approaches to prevention. The i2i Fee Schedule is as follows: 1. First Year Schools: Receive the program at no cost. This allows them to schedule an i2i Program without the stress of seeking funding and they can focus on quality program implementation and serving their students and community. 2. Second Year Schools: Receive the program at for $950.00. This is 50% of regular program fee plus approximately 50% of the projected travel expenses. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 11 of 12 MFGRANTFY16 -IDFY 3. Third Year Schools: Receive the program at full price $1450.00 . We have already facilitated i2i Programs for third year schools, with more on the way. Multiple schools are currently in their second year. 4. Fourth Year Schools: Schools will reset and become a first year school again. While we want schools to believe in the program and take on more ownership, we also want to come alongside and offer as much assistance for these schools and students as possible. With this fee schedule layout, we hope to: - Grow the i2i Program throughout Idaho and reach new schools every year. - Sustain existing or returning schools and help them plan out their budgets in advance. - Allow schools who believe in the program to invest their own time, energy and resources into maintaining their i2i Program, which we believe enhance projected outcomes. The fee schedule is the perfect balance between sustaining our program over multiple years, and keeping costs low for schools and communities. If the Millennium Fund were to be absent, schools would undergo 100% of the burden to maintain their i2i Program on an already stressed budget. IDFY will always continue to offer the i2i Program as a service and also a small revenue stream for the organization. Still, with the Millennium Fund, we are able to reach further and deeper into the heart of Idaho communities, and we are confident that the i2i Program is a responsible and appropriate extension of these endowment funds. In partnership with the Millennium Fund Committee, and the faith of our Governor and Joint Finance Appropriations Committee, IDFY will continue to use this unique methodology to reduce teen substance abuse. IX. Evidence-Based Research 1. Challenging Alcohol Expectancies with Media Literacy as a Prevention Strategy & Wiveca Borjesson Holman, Ph.D 2010-2011 http://medialiteracy.net/pdf/Challenging_Expectancies_for_Prevention.pdf This article cites the empirical research that shows Media Literacy skills training is an effective method to prevent and reduce underage drinking. Additionally, researchers found that the risk of frequent exposure to persuasive media is moderated by parental reinforcement and counter-reinforcement of messages. This methodology has been shown to considerably prevent youth from engaging in behaviors that are depicted by the media. 2. Preventing Substance Abuse Problems Among Youth: A Literature Review and Recommendations Angela Paglia, Robin Room - Addiction Research Foundation Division Center for Addiction and Mental Health May, 1998 http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021302302085#page-1 With a goal of specifying effective programs to reduce tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug abuse among teens, this paper evaluates and distinguishes between multiple prevention strategies which are either deemed ineffective, somewhat effective, and those that are most promising. The researchers found that social influence methodologies that teach skills that counteract pressures and motivate students to resist them are most promising. It highlighted that establishing \"anti-drug social norms\" and \"non-use norms\" is an effective means to undermine popular beliefs that drug use is prevalent and acceptable. 3. Research-Based Practice - Connecting Students to Schools to support Their Emotional Well-Being and Academic Success Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 12 of 12 MFGRANTFY16 -IDFY Michael L. Sulkowski, Michelle K. Demaray, & Philip J. Lazarus, May 2012 http://www.nasponline.org/publications/cq/40/7/connecting-students.aspx This school psychology review of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health which included 36,000 youth asserts that school connectedness is the strongest protective factor for both girls and boys for decreasing drug and alcohol use, along with other risk behaviors. The review encourages programs that provide support for disconnected and marginalized youth as a means to foster the resiliency factors that contribute to adolescent health.

Rationale or Justification for Project: Alcohol use among teens is linked to the abuse of additional drugs, school problems and decreased academic pe rformance, unwanted/unprotected sexual activity, physical and sexual assault, bullying and fighting, and death. Each year the cost to Idaho residents for underage drinking caused issues exceeds $300 million. 90% of Americans who m eet the medical criteria for addiction started drinking, smoking, or using other drugs before the age of 18 http://www.casacolumbia.org/addiction-research . Teen substance use is a preventable public health issue but still poses an enormous danger for Idaho teens. Additionally, the long range conseque nces for the entire population are severe and expensive. Programs that are offered and inserted within the school environment that promote positive peer norms have shown evidence of decreasing alcohol and drug use, while increasing academic performance and school connectedness. Psychologists and educational experts have found that the guiding principles of se lf worth, engagement, and purpose lead to host of conditions that foster student success. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 2 MFREPORTFY14-IDFY Project Summary : The i2i Program is a unique multi-faceted approach to prevent teen substance use in Idaho, through: - Idaho Drug Free Youth i2i Student Assemblies that capture the attention students and inspire them to lead happy and healthy lives, be drug and al cohol free, and create caring school climates to increase positive peer influence. - Evening Presentations that are designed to educate Idaho students, parents, and influential adults on the primary reasons teens use and abus e alcohol. Participants learn the impact of media messages and how they influence and promote favorable expectancies toward alcohol, and how to shape accurate perceptions of the dangers of underage drinking. - A marketing campaign that promotes dates and locations of each i2i - True Confessions . Varied marketing elements include newspaper press releases, posters, and postcard invitations. Geographic Area Covered: The i2i Program is a statewide de liverable service fo r Idaho schools and communities.

Idaho Conference on Alcohol and Drug Dependency Background: Provided continuing education to substance abuse and prevention professionals, educators and recovery support for over thirty years. Stake holders represented on the ICADD Board of Directors: Treatment/prevention and managed care providers VA Medical Center, Boise Idaho Office of Drug Policy Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Idaho Department of Correction Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections Idaho Supreme Court The Foundation for ICADD is a professionally managed Idaho non-profit (501 c 3) which seeks to reinvest resources in the education of public and private substance abuse/prevention professionals throughout the State of Idaho. More information at: www.attendicadd.com Purpose of Grant Because of the increased emphasis on the use of evidence based practices in the treatment and prevention of substance use disorders (SUD), training and education are crucial needs for the SUD professional community. Historically, the Idaho Conference on Alcohol and Drug Dependency (ICADD) has addressed this need through an annual conference. This conference has been a primary vehicle in providing information about evidence based practices and the most current expertise in the design and delivery of effective services and prevention efforts. Over time, Idaho SUD treatment and recovery support service providers, as well as community prevention professionals and coalition members, have found it increasingly difficult to attend ICADD because of the cost. The purpose of this grant request is to fund scholarships, based on need, to enable providers and community members, particularly those from rural and frontier communities, to attend ICADD. Grant Administration Grant management, who benefits and evidence based foundation of training program. 1. ICADD will offer stipends to include cost of the conference, travel, and lodging for substance abuse/prevention providers in rural Idaho 2. Rural providers and the individual, families and communities they serve 3. ICADD offers a wide range of Evidenced Based Trainings (EBT's) including; Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Wellness Recovery Action Plan, Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) and Motivational Interviewing 4. Over the past few years ICADD has placed a greater emphasis on prevention/trauma and how it relates addiction, pain management, and prescription abuse (both from a prevention and treatment perspective), and treating Veterans. 5. On an annual basis, ICADD is a recognized continuing education provider by the Idaho Bureau Of Occupational Licenses (IBOL). Outcomes of Grant An expanding base of knowledge for SUD/Tobacco treatment and prevention providers throughout the State of Idaho. 1. Tobacco Cessation; all participants that attend ICADD will be able to attend a breakout session on Medication Assisted treatment. In this training they will learn different nicotine replacement therapies. 2. Substance Abuse Prevention; Over the past three years ICADD has placed a greater emphasis on substance abuse prevention. We now have representatives from the prevention community as part of our board and planning committee this includes the Governors Director of Drug Policy. We are able to have national speakers present the latest research in prevention. We are also able to have subject matter experts present on how other states are affected by the passing of medical marijuana laws, as well as the latest substances young people are abusing. 3. Substance Abuse Treatment; This is what we do best. Historically we have national keynote speakers attend our conference to present the latest research in substance abuse. The conference provides 24 continuing education hours on an annual basis. These speakers are a combination of national, regional, and local subject matter experts. Our conference offers a wide range of breakout sessions so each individual participant can individualize their conference to meet their needs and the needs of the community they serve. Each year we have breakouts on relapse prevention, suicide prevention, and ethics training. Thank you Joint Millennium Fund Committee members for the opportunity to present this grant proposal.

We have sponsored and organized an annual conference since 1984. The conference is att ended by providers, volunteer community coalition members and state agency staff who work with those who receive state-funded SUD services. II. Grant Proposal Summary Meets One or More of the Following Criteria : (Indicate Yes Where Applicable) 1. Tobacco Cessation or Prevention 2. Substance Abuse Cessation or Prevention Yes 3. Tobacco or Substance Abuse Treatment Yes Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 6 ICADD GRANT PROPOSAL FINAL Purpose of Grant : Because of the increased emphasis on the use of evidence based practices in the treatment and prevention of substance use disorders (SUD), tr aining and education are crucial needs for the SUD professional community. Historically, the Idaho Conference on Alcohol and Drug Dependency (ICADD) has addressed this need through an annual conference. This conference has been a primary vehicle in providing information about evidence based practices and the most current expertise in the design and delivery of effective services and prevention efforts. Over time, Idaho SUD treatment and recovery support service providers, as well as community pr evention professionals and coalition members, have found it increasing difficult to attend ICADD because of the cost. The purpose of this grant request is to fund scholarships, based on need, to enable provider s and community members, particularly those from rural and frontier communities, to attend ICADD. Grant Amount Requested (should tie to budget table) : $77,500 III.

IV. Statement of Need To achieve the most positive outcomes from treat ment for substance use disorders and the greatest impact from community-based efforts to reduce the harmf ul effects of the misuse of alcohol and use of illegal drugs, it is increasingl y understood that well-researched, evidence-based practices must be utilized. These practices, to achieve their potential benefits, must be delivered with high fidelity to the methods developed and evaluated as being effective. Such fidelity requires a high level of education and training. This training is often only available from national experts. The annual Idaho Conference on Alcohol and Drug Dependency is Idaho's premier training venue for the I daho network of 95 approved treatment providers and 33 recovery support provider agencies and more than 50 prevention professionals. These professionals, many working in rural and frontier communities, are highly motivated to employ the most effective methods of treatment but often lack access to quality training and education in these evidence-based practices. At the same ti me Idaho's small non-profit treatment agencies are only able to produce revenues to support operations when t heir staff members are act ually delivering services to clients. Time away from the agency to attend training is time that is unreimbursed. That revenue loss, added to the costs of conference travel and attendance, is increasingly preventing many Idaho professionals from obtaining the education and trai ning they need. Reaching even 100 treatment and prevention professionals with the most up-to-date information and opportunity for skill development in delivering evidence-based practices will result in significantly improved outcomes and an enhanced return from Idaho's substantial investment in substance use disorder treatment services and prevention efforts. These 100 professionals would also have the opportunity to bring their new knowledge and training back to their agencies to share with other professional s who may not have been able to attend, increasing the return on investment even more. In turn, these im proved outcomes will achieve many positive social and community benefits including improved community safety and livability, reunited families, reduced welfare and child welfare costs, and reduced crime and victimization. V. Project Design Funding provided through this grant will be administe red by The Foundation for the Idaho Conference on Alcohol and Drug Dependency, Inc. Providers will be invited to apply for scholarships for the annual conference which will be held for four days in Boise in May 2016. The scholarship will cover the necessary cost of conference registration and lo dging, meals and a stipend for travel expense, where required. Applicants will be asked which evidence-b ased practices they are planning to implement or strengthen in their practice. Applic ants for scholarships will be asked to submit their applications through their Regional Behavioral Health Boards (RBHB). It will be the RBHBs responsibility to ensure those applicants being forwarded to the ICADD Foundation Board meet a SUD service need in their regions. The ICADD Foundation Board will make the final decisions regarding who receive scholarships to attend the conference. VI. Grant Management The grant will be managed by the Foundation Board of Directors, under the leadership of Chairman Thomas Hogan and the Executive Director of the Foundation, Chris Daniel. The Foundation is a federally recognized 501 (c) (3) nonprofit corporation which produces the annual conference. Board members meet frequently to review expenditures (through repo rts prepared by the Exec utive Director and the Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 ICADD GRANT PROPOSAL FINAL Board Chief Financial Officer) and to approve an annual budget and ongoing expenditures. Scholarships will be provided through pre-payment of conference regi stration cost and a check to the recipient for the related travel expenses. Conference participants complete a post conference evaluation form and the evaluations will be compiled by the Ex ecutive Director for Board review. The Board will receive reports on the scholarship application process and be directly in volved in the selection of recipients. The funds allocated to the scholarships and their expenditure wi ll be closely monitored by the Board and the Board Chief Financial Officer. VII. Evaluation Plan The ICADD Foundation Board Strategic Plan for 2014- 2019 contains specific goals to increase the number of attendees to the conference (Goal 1) and to increase the number of attendees who are able to complete at least one certification while attending a c onference (Goal 2). A very specific plan has been created to evaluate performance on meeting these goals. Funding of this grant will clearly play a huge part in achieving these goals for the 2016 conference. All those attending the conference on funding from this grant would be required to do a conference evaluation. This info rmation will be used to ensure that the conference is meeting the needs of SUD prof essionals and help the board make any changes that are needed to establish the conference as a worthwhile in vestment for future attendance, when this specific funding is not available. The ICADD Stra tegic Plan is included under Addendums. VIII. Sustainability Goal 4 for the ICADD Strategic Plan (see Addendums) is to increase funding for the conference from sources other than conference registration fees. Fund ing for this proposal will give the Board substantial time before the 2017 conference to work on funding from other sources. It is felt that the conference provides sufficient value to those in the field that t he case can be made to a broad spectrum of healthcare entities that their financial support is a good inve stment. Substance use disorders are increasingly being seen as drivers of high healthcare costs. Idaho has a number of large healthcare providers who are increasingly affected when quality SUD services are not available within an integrated healthcare system. We also believe that by bringing 100 additional attendees to the conference for one year, we will be creating a new attendee base for future conferences. IX. Evidence-Based Research Evidence Based Practices: The proposed conference scholarship project will enable participants to learn approaches to implementing multiple evidence-based tr eatment approaches including: Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Dialectical Behavioral Th erapy (DBT) is increasingly being u tilized in substance use disorder treatment. Evidence for its efficacy is demonstrated by, among other studies, t wo randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DBT, supported by gr ants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Drug Abuse. These studies, representing the \"gold standard\" of effectiveness evaluation, have indicated that DBT is more effective than Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) in treatment of BPD and treatment of BP D and co-morbid diagnosis of substance abuse (Linehan, Armstrong, Suarez,Allmon & Heard, 1991; Linehan, Schmidt, Dimeff, Craft, Kanter & Comtois, 1999). Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 6 ICADD GRANT PROPOSAL FINAL DBT- Dialectical Behavior Therapy http://behavioraltech.org/resources/whatisdbt.cfm Motivational Interviewing Motivational Interviewing is increasingly being used in a wide variety of treatment and prevention settings to elicit the individual's inherent positive motiv ation to change or to embrace healthy lifestyle choices including substance us e - alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco. The two studies below have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach and the approach has found wide application in Idaho among those who will be the target audience for this scholarship program.

The Community Coalitions of Idaho (CCI) is a statewide organization that was founded in 2009. CCI is comprised of over 30 coalitions across Idaho, working to reduce substance abuse among youth through media campaigns, emphasis patrols, mentoring programs, trainings, victim's panels and other environmental strategies. The coalitions are comprised of law enforcement, sc hool officials, business owners, mental health services, various community non-profits, youth services and other community members. CCI reaches all demographics from the far northern counties to the south eastern counties in both urban and rural areas. CCI's proposal for funding would reach those communities throughout the state, both rural and urban and most importantly, would provide the 'best bang for your buck'. It would have statewide impact in youth substance prevention. CCI is requesting funding to support the growth of subs tance abuse prevention coalitions in communities across the State of Idaho. Funds will cover the cost of statewide trainings, website an d social media outreach, substance abuse educational resources and the administrative cost for an Executive Director to oversee prevention activities and coalition sustainability. Funds will also help cover the costs of travel for the Executive Director to provide support and development for coalitions in communities throughout the state. We appreciate your consideration in funding our organization and investing in a healthy, substance free future for our youth.

Representatives fr om coalitions across the state determined the need for an organizational structure that woul d support networking, information sharing, technical support, training opportunities and advocacy for all participants. Participating coalitions represent large and small, urban and rural communities across Idaho. Members prov ide support to one another while sharing ideas, strengths, information, resources and enthusiasm for healthy communities. Working with partners at the local, state and national level, CCI strives to facilitate collabora tion and address issues with a united voice. CCI's current network includes more than 30 community coalitions and partner agencies with representation in all seven Idaho Departm ent of Health and Welfare regions. CCI is governed by an Executive Board, which consists of a representative from each of the seven IDHW Regions, an Executive Director who answers to the Executive Board, and two committees; the Advocacy Committee and the Capa city Committee. Decisions are ma de by the Executive Board and presented to the general members for a formal vote. The Executive Board officers include a Chair, Vice- Chair, Secretary and Treasurer. Some of our prevention partners include: loca l and state police departments, Juvenile Justice and Corrections, Alcohol Beverage Control, Idaho Liquor Division, Department of Health and Welfare, Regional Behavioral Health Boards, Elks, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Idaho Drug Free Youth, and many more. CCI's purpose is to: provide a forum for communi ty coalitions to come together to promote prevention efforts and share ideas; establish a Strate gic Prevention Plan; devel op a state level framework for community coalitions; seek funding that w ill accomplish coalition goal s; increase stakeholder involvement of prevention coalitions of Idaho; increase the number of pr evention coalitions in the state; Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16 APP increase capacity of community coalitions to implement environmental strategies; and maintain representation of diverse prevent ion coalitions and partners. CCI meets in-person three times per year, in different Regions of the State, in an effort to make the meetings accessible to all coalition members. CC I also meets via conference call monthly, as does the Executive Committee. CCI has developed strategies to support the logic model for developing more community coalitions across the state, and assi sts with existing coalitions in maintaining active members, creating necessary coalition documents (bylaws, policy and procedures, etc.) and creat ing successful drug and alcohol prevention strategies. Coalitions are the dr iving force in our communities to ensure our youth lead healthy and productive lives, free of substance abuse. II. Grant Proposal Summary Meets One or More of the Following Criteria : (Indicate Yes Where Applicable) 1. Tobacco Cessation or Prevention Yes 2. Substance Abuse Cessation or Prevention Yes 3.

Mi sc. fees will cover the cost of 1 working lunch per training at the government rate of $10.50 x approximately 90 attendees per training. IV. Statement of Need In the past, CCI has received funding from t he Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws (EUDL). These funds have covered all trainings, meetings, tr avel scholarships, as well as the salary for the Executive Director. Because of this funding s ource, we have been able to implement some very successful trainings and activities, and have creat ed valuable partnerships with local and state law enforcement, juvenile justice, and others. In March of 2014, we held the very first joint training for law enforcement and coalition members, Enforcement and Prevention - Working Together for our Communities. Speakers presented topics on underage drinking, collaboration, gambling issues, prescription drug use and other enforcement and prevention strategies. As mentioned, CCI holds face to face training/ meetings three times per year. At the meeting portions of these trainings, members have the oppor tunity to participate in goal setting and problem solving activities. Logic Models and Problem Statements have been created at those meetings and the results are as follows: Problem- 1. Lack of Coalition Development and Sustainability. Why? Lack of funding available for trainings, lack of knowledge regarding available resources, community and cultural differences, reduction in funding and community resources. Problem 2. Lack of strong coalitions in ever y community. Why? Lack of education and/or concern by citizens, lack of a model to follow or fr amework and mentoring, lack of funding, not aware of evidence showing positive effects of strong community coalitions. Problem 3. Increasing substance use rates among youth as evidenced by y outh surveys. Why? Lack of positive protective factors for youth, increa se in youth risk factors, lack of active community coalitions working to increase awareness and education in communities, lack of substance free activities and environmental strategies implemented by community coalitions. Alcohol continues to be the number one substanc e used by youth but synthetic and prescription drugs are increasing in popularity. Additionally, with the legalization of marijuana in neighboring states, we are seeing an increase in youth marijuana use. With the perception that it is legal, therefore safe, we expect to see those rates continue to rise over the y ears. Community coalitions can address these issues on a local level and with continued funding for CCI, we can support those coalitions and have a better impact on a reduction of those rates. As of September 2014, EUDL funding has ended fo r us, but with the opportunity for Millennium funding, we will be able to sustain our statewide coa lition, continue to offer training opportunities, and support and increase the number of community coalit ions around the State of Idaho. We feel that by funding CCI, you will in turn be assisting our statew ide partner and member coalitions and receive a 'bigger bang for your buck'. Millennium funds will have a bigger impact, both on a statewide level, as well as on a community level, in each of the seven IDHW Regions. V. Project Design Goals to address Problem 1: Continue to offe r education, trainings and coalition support. Objectives: Offer tri-annual trainings for coalitions and partners. Trainings will be offered on coalition development and sustainability, collaboration with local agencies (law enforcement, legislators, schools, businesses, parents, local tribes, etc.), setting goals and obj ectives, evaluation, strategic Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16 APP and environmental strategies and other prevention t opics. This will be accomplished by the CCI Executive Director (ED), Executive Board (EB), and partner organizations; Provide educational materials regarding underage drinking, tobacco, e-cigarettes, prescription and synthetic drugs and marijuana to coalitions fo r distribution to parent s, youth, schools, and community organizations. This will be accomplished by the ED and EB; Continue to provide updates and information via social media and the CCI website. This will be the responsibility of the ED. Goals to address Problem 2: Increase in stro ng and active coalitions in every community. Objectives: Continue to offer coalition education and support. This will be the responsibility of the ED and will include direct support through personal one-on- one visits, telephone, email correspondence, networking, and other online support and trainings; Information dissemination to community member s on the effectiveness of creating and supporting local coalitions. This will be the respon sibility of the ED, EB and Capacity Committee; Assist local coalitions with grant writing traini ngs, grant opportunities and grant submissions. This will be the responsibility of the ED and EB. Goals to address Problem 3: Decrease substance use rates as evidenced by youth surveys. Objectives: Educate coalitions, partner members and communiti es of the importance of increasing protective factors, reducing risk factors, and the importa nce of staying involved and current on trends and youth activities. This will be the responsib ility of the EB, ED, and the Capacity Committee; Continue to train and educate community coalitio ns of how to implement effective and evidence based prevention activities. These activities may include environmental strategies, enforcement strategies, education and training opportunities for youth and community, leadership trainings, etc. This will be the responsibility of the ED, EB and general members; Educate coalition members on advocacy issues, laws and legislation regarding substance use among youth, and research on the effects of these substances on the underdeveloped brain. This will be the responsibility of the ED, EB and Advocacy Committee. Desired outcomes of these implemented strategies will be: Increase the number of active coalitions in Idaho by 10% (estimated increase of 3). This will be measured by a comparison of number of coalitions in existence as of 01/2015 to those in 01/2016; Increase in territory and population covered by a coalition by 10% (estimated increase of 1,000). This will be measured by a comparison of size of territory and population covered by a coalition ass of 01/2015 to one year later; Number of training events held and number of people trained in building substance use prevention community coalitions by 5% (estimated increase of 2). This will be measured by sign in sheets at coalition trainings; Increased education and knowledge of current community coalition members by hosting tri- annual trainings. This will be measured by an increase in knowledge on pre and post training evaluations; Increased media output by distribu ting media materials in at least 5 new locations. This will be measured by the quantity and type of media output from CCI and its members, outreach efforts to the public and legislature; Increased outreach efforts by increasing communication with a least 3 communities currently without a coalition. This will be measured by the number of emails sent, phone calls, materials distributed, and/or on-site visits; Decrease or maintain current rates of yout h substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, prescription and synthetic drugs, marijuana and ot her illegal substances. This will be evaluated by statewide youth surveys, arrest and hospital reports, juvenile justice reports, and other data on youth substance use rates. VI. Grant Management Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16 APP CCI is comprised of community coalition director s and staff from across the State of Idaho, as well as many leaders from state agencies such as Juv enile Justice, Department of Education, Idaho State Police, and Health and Welfare. The majority of current CCI participants have vast experience administering federal, state and local grants. The CCI Executive Director has been involved with community coalition leadership for nearly twenty y ears, is a Certified Prevention Specialist, and has served as the Regional Advisory Council (RAC) Ch air for Region 1. She has served as the State Representative on the ICSA Committee and is currently serving as a coalition representative on the Idaho State Behavioral Health Council. The CCI Executive Committee consists of seven members, one from each Idaho Department of Health and Welfare R egion: Chair- Alisha Passey, Bonneville Youth Development Council, Vice Chair- Michael David, Blaine County Community Drug Coalition, and Treasurer- Cindy Schille r, Treasure Valley Anti-Drug Coalition. The Chair of our Advocacy Committee is Nancy Lopez from EUDL, (Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws), and the Chair for our Capacity Committee is Darin Burrell from the Fremont County coalition. The combined knowledge and experience of these committee chairs, as well as our other Executive B oard members, is excepti onal. Many of these board members have been involved with CCI since its incepti on, back in 2009. The Executive Director answers directly to the Executive Board. The Executive Board is responsible for all major decision and presents discussion topics to the general membership for voting. CCI represents and supports all member coalitions and works hard to involve members in all decisions regarding CCI's focus, goals and objectives. They also work to bring in new coalition members in an effort to increase and strengthen CCI's voice for substance prevention for youth. VII. Evaluation Plan Our main objectives are to strengthen existing coa litions, and mentor new coalitions, and create an advocacy networks to educate the public and lawm akers on issues related to underage drinking, tobacco and other drug use. Our activities will include: 1. Solicit input from the Office of Drug Policy, DHW, Dept. of Ed., and other agencies on where they see the community need fo r a coalition; 2. Review substance use statistics to identify communities in greatest need of coalitio ns; 3. Engage recruited members of CCI and partner organizations and assist them with developing and im plementing substance abuse prevention strategies; 4. Provide necessary education, trainings, resource distribution, and most current updates on new drug and alcohol trends to all coalitions throughout the state; 5. Continue to nurture relationships with partner agencies in an effort to fully address all substance abuse issues in all Idaho youth. Evaluation methods will in clude: 1. Comparison of number of coalitions in existence as of July 2015 to those in July of 2014; 2. Comparison of size of territory and populations covered by a coalition as of July 2014 to one year later; 3. Attendance of trai ning events for strengtheni ng coalitions; 4. Survey style evaluations at training events to determine e ffectiveness; 5. Quality and type of media output from CCI and its members, outreach efforts to the public and legislature. Some of the primary evaluation questions will include: Past 30 day use rate s of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs (ATOD), age of onset ATOD, lifetime us e of ATOD and perception of risk associated with use of these substances. In addition to this prev iously mentioned evaluation methods, CCI will also review youth survey results as well as other data. CCI has established good working relationships with the Department of Education, Juv enile Justice, Health and Welfare, and law enforcement. We will use data collected by these agencies to determine if our coalitions are being effective in: (a) reduction in substance use rates among youth; (b) increase in t he perception of risk of youth substance use; (c) reduction in the age of onset of first use of tobac co, alcohol and other substances; (d) increase in protective factors that help youth to lead drug free lives. By using these evaluation methods and monitoring the collected data, CCI will be able to determine what coalition prevention methods are worki ng, if they are working, and what we need to change or continue to implement in order to best address youth substance use in Idaho. VIII. Sustainability Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16 APP Although funding is extremely limited for our coalition, we have still managed to maintain and recruit active coalition members. We feel we offer a unique service to our members and can provide resources to assist them in the coalitions. When our coalition initially started in 2009, we had no funding, just the desire for coalitions to connect statewide, and provide resources and expert ise to our members. We held monthly telephone conference calls and shared ideas, re sources and strategic plans. We feel that regardless of funding, our coalition will remain strong and active. The funding we received in 2013 has helped us to continue the work that was started back in 2009, and expand on t he documents and plans that were initiated from the beginning. With the help of our ED and Executiv e Board, we have been able to draft Policies and Procedures, Goals and Objective and a Strategic Plan fo r our organization. We also have developed and implemented a Code of Ethics, Mission and Vision we follow, as well as other working documents that help guide our organization. We also feel we have something even more important, community and statewide 'buy in'. The CCI name is becoming more and more rec ognized throughout the state and we will continue to remain current in address substance abuse through environment approaches and provide the necessary support and trainings for coalition throug hout the State of Idaho. We have been actively seeking funding assistance through a variety of grant applications, online donations, membership fees, as well as online charitable gifting. CCI also has a very strong volunteer membership base. One of these members is from the Idaho National Guard Counterdrug Support Program. Janie Ramos has been valuable to us and has administered the Kaizen Survey to our coalition members. This survey was given at one of our trainings/meetings that was held in Boise in October of 2013. We have used the results of this survey to better meet the needs of our coalition members and a ddress any areas of concern. This survey will again be administered in 1 year and the results will help us continue to keep our coalition relevant and attentive to members wants, needs and concerns. By insuring me mber satisfaction, it will help to insure coalition sustainability. Without the support of Millennium funding or othe r grant sources, CCI will not be able to continue the high quality training and education we currently o ffer our members. We feel this is extremely important in being able to continue to best addres s the needs of our youth and community members. New trends are emerging daily and without the knowledge and support that CCI currently offers, many of our coalitions will not be equipped to address these issues. We sincerely hope the Millennium Fund Committee will see CCI as an important asset to our Idaho prevention coalitions, as well as our youth, and approve our request for funding. IX.

Idaho Legislative Services Office Addendum State of Idaho Office of Drug Policy Executive Office of the Governor October 8, 2014 Joint Millennium Fund Committee Room C305, State Capitol Boise, Idaho 83720 Dear Committee Members, I am pleased to lend support to the Community Coalitions of Idaho's (CCI) Millennium Fund request. I have the good fortune of being a past member of CCI and I am keenly aware of the vital work community coalitions do throughout our great state. If granted, CCI's request will allow them to continue their work in supporting community coalitions throughout the state, as well as developing new coalitions. These organizations are powerful prevention partners and CCI has become an invaluable resource to them. The statewide organization works to educate, support, and provide resources to coalitions, as well as connecting them with each other to collaborate and benefit from shared experiences. At the Office of Drug Policy (ODP), we know t hat the type of prevention work done by community coalitions is often the most successful in producing sustainab le change. When ODP needs to know what is happening in an individual community, who the relevant stakeholders are, or how we can best work in a community, coalitions are our first contact . Without them, \"boots on the ground\" prevention work would not get done. Therefore, I encourage the Joint Millennium Fund Committee to grant CCI's request for funding. Warm regards , Elisha Figueroa Administrator, Office of Drug Policy C.L. \"Butch\" Otter Governor Elisha Figueroa Administrator 304 N 8th Street, Room 455 Boise, ID 83702 208-854-3042 208-854-3041 To: Millennium Fund Committee R e: Local Importance December 1, 2014 My name is Kevin Pettingill and I've been invited to share my feelings with regards to our local coalition here in Bonneville County, the Bonneville Youth Development Council. I have served my community for 26 years as a police officer and just retired August 1st of this year. Ea rly in my career, I watched as different organizations would strive to do their specific jobs and for the most part do them well. Many organizations didn't know how to bring everyone to the same table to become a healthy and more complete community, so time and time again small and vital parts would be overlooked. Then several visionary leaders figured out that if all these pieces could start to come together, a wide variety of very positive benefits would begin to form for e veryone involved. Part of that included becoming members of the Community Coalitions of I daho (CCI). This group helped connect our coalition with other coalitions and helped members to understand the role law enforcement could have. As I was involved, positive events started taking place. Our communications improved with the other members. Many of our local events that either required or could be enhanced by law enforcement were discussed with other local leaders. Because of the coalition's work, positive a nd enlightened ideas helped to strengthen our community and our community started to bloss om. The youth jumped on board and have given hundreds of hours of service and now have a strong voice in our community. Law enforcement started to work with other groups to help make our community safer, including partnering with Idaho State Police Alcohol Beverage Control. We started doing more regular and consistent compliance checks and helping with se rver trainings. The coalition has held trainings for law enforcement and now has a taskforce subcommittee to look specifically at substance abuse system issues. This kept underage drinking and now other substance abuse issues on the fore thought of our minds. As for Law Enforcement, our coalition has been a unique, positive gift to help us not only be a stronger part of our community, but also to better serve our citizens. I know money is as tight as e ver, but whatever you could give will definitely help in many levels of making our community, along with others throughout the state stronger and better. This i s definitely the right time in our history for more of these coalitions all over our great State of Idaho and I support our local coalition, as well as the Community Coalitions of Idaho and its e fforts to reduce substance abuse across Idaho.

Darin Burrell, Capacity Building Committee Chair Nancy Lopez, Advocacy Committee Chair Meetings __________________________________________________________ CCI holds monthly conference calls the first Wednesday of each month and monthly board meeting c onference calls the last Wednesday of the month. In additional, CCI holds three in-person meetings per year. These meetings provide information unique to our state, trainings for coalitions and subst ance abuse prevention education. The purpose of these meetings is to provide education and training, including a knowledge base for effective prevention strategies and networking and sharing among community coalitions and partners. Many community coalitions do not have funding for training. CCI knows and understands these needs and allows funding for scholarships to our me etings. These scholarships are provided on a first come first serve basis. Expenses are prioritized by first travel expenses, then hotel and then meals based on available funds. Members a re asked to car pool and share rooms where appropriate. The CCI Board is very conscious about using our funds very efficiently and yet being flexible to best serve the coalitions. In-person meeting agendas are set by members and partners based on the needs of our state and loca l communities, as well as current trends. Also, CCI plans our in-person meetings around other conferences and trainings in an effort to be most effective with our training funds and coalition members and partners time. For example, last year we partnered with the Idaho Conference on Alcohol and Drug Dependence (ICADD). CCI met the day after the conference and we had a National Speaker from CADCA (Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America). Because this speaker was already here we only had to pay for an extra night at the hotel and their extra preparation time. COMMUNITY COALITIONS OF IDAHO (CCI) Mission : Support community coalition's efforts to prevent substance abuse in Idaho Vision : Safe and healthy Idaho communities free of substance abuse About Us___________________________________ Community Coalitions of Idaho (CCI) is a statewide coalition of community coalitions that was organized in early 2009 to strengthen advocacy efforts for substance abuse prevention in Idaho.

The Boys & Girls Clubs in Idaho have actively sought to enrich the lives of girls and boys whom other youth agencies have had difficulty in reaching. We have a history of and are dedicated to ensuring that our community's most disadvantaged have access to high quality afterschool and summer programs and services that will enhance and support academic, social and economic success for themselves and their families. Boys & Girls Clubs provide the most comprehensive safety net for children at risk in our state - at little to no direct cost to our members. The Boys & Girls Clubs in Idaho are part of a nationwide affiliation of local, autonomous organizations chartered by Boys & Girls Clubs of America to help youth of all backgrounds develop the qualities needed to become responsible citizens and leaders. We offer quality afterschool and summer programs that benefit Idaho children and their working families. We believe that every child deserves a great future!

II. Grant Proposal Summary Meets One or More of the Following Criteria : (Indicate Yes Where Applicable) 1. Tobacco Cessation or Prevention Yes 2. Substance Abuse Cessation or Prevention Yes 3. Tobacco or Substance Abuse Treatment Purpose of Grant : The needs of teens are significantly different from that of their younger counterparts. As such, Boys & Girls Clubs have developed a number of programs that respond to the challenge of being a teenager - engaging them in interactive and fun ways, while providing them with a high level of autonomy, opportunities for influence and leadership, a breadth of activities to participate in, and opportunities to socialize with their peers. The cornerstones of the Teen Empowerment Program are our Boys & Girls Club teen leadership programs: Torch Club, Keystone Club, Youth of the Year TORCH & KEYSTONE CLUBS: These programs provide teens unique opportunities to grow, prepare for the future and become leaders in their Clubs and in their communities, They feature: dedicated programming space for teen activities; activities based on the assessed needs and interests of local teens; teen-specific programming in all core program areas; teen homework support, opportunities for leadership and influence, including Junior Staff programs; and opportunities to participate in planning and implementing Club activities. Torch Clubs , targeting \"tweens\" and teens ages 11- 13, are chartered small-group leadership and service clubs. Mentored by Club staff and volunteers, Torch Club members learn to work together to plan and implement activities in four areas: service to Club and community; education; health and fitness; and social recreation. As part of their service activities, Torch Club members identify Club and community needs, and create projects to address them. Torch Club activities also provide experience in the democratic process, as members elect officers and utilize group decision-making processes. Above all, Torch Club gives young people a chance to contribute something of value to others. Torch Club members also take part in educational activities that focus on personal development. These activities develop skills in problem-solving, communications, goal setting and decision-making. Keystone Club , which targets teens ages 14-18, promotes character and leadership among teens by providing them with opportunities to create, direct and participate in activities in three areas: academics, career preparation and community service. At the heart of the Keystone Club experience is character and leadership development. Through Club and community service projects, members learn first-hand the importance of cultivating and exercising the virtues of compassion, tolerance, responsibility and citizenship. Keystone Club is a unique character development experience that gives young people a chance to act on their humanitarian ideals while building self-respect and strong attachments to family and community. Under the caring and supportive guidance of an advisor, Keystone Club members participate in self-governance Idaho Legislative Services Offic e Page 3 of 7 MILLENNIUM 2016 GRANT by planning, coordinating and participating in youth-initiated projects and activities. Keystone members also serve as important role models for younger members and can be involved in recruiting new teen members for their Boys & Girls Club. While benefits to the Club and community service can be translated to a monetary figure, the benefits reaped by the young people offering their service have a positive impact on them personally - both immediate and into the future. According to recent studies by the University of Nevada: 1. Youth who volunteer just one hour or more a week are 50% less likely to abuse alcohol, cigarettes, become pregnant, or engage other destructive behavior. 2. Teens say the benefits received from volunteering are: Learning to respect others; learning to be helpful and kind; learning to understand people who are different; developing leadership skills, becoming more patient, and better understanding of citizenshi p. 3. Youth who volunteer are more likely to do well in school, graduate and vote. Beyond the personal benefits, young people as a whole are rewarded in our society when they volunteer. Many adults hold negative beliefs about young people in general. They look odd and dress wildly. They travel in large groups and engage in rowdy behavior while playing loud music. The media portrays negative images of youth who get into trouble and commit crimes, for example. Sixty-one percent of American adults are convinced that today's youth face a crisis in their values and morals, look at teenagers with misgiving, and view them as undisciplined, disrespectful and unfriendly. Young people perceive these negative beliefs. Only 20% of young people perceive that adults in the community value them. When presented with images of young people doing community service, the opinion of adults tend to be changed. Volunteer opportunities provide an environment for people of different generations to work together for a common goal, as well as offer an opportunity for mutual understanding. Funding of these programs through the Millennium Fund will provide staffing, supplies, incentives, field trips, transportation etc. that will allow us to expand our Torch and Keystone Clubs to serve a minimum of 600 Idaho youth, ages 11-18. It will also allow for up to 4 outstanding teens and 2 staff from each club site the opportunity to attend the National Keystone Conference, where they will receive recognition for their achievements, learn and engage on all matters pertaining to teens, and network with peer leaders from across the country. YOUTH OF THE YEAR Becoming a Club's Youth of the Year is the highest honor a Boys & Girls Club member can receive and recognizes the recipient's outstanding contributions to family, school, community and the Boys & Girls Club while overcoming significant personal challenges and obstacles. The Youth of the Year program provides youth, ages 6-18, with an opportunity to achieve the following: Develop healthy attitudes toward home, community, school and Club; Recognize the importance of patriotism and good character, and demonstrate them in all aspects of their daily lives through civic engagement; Strengthen their moral values; Build positive self-concepts; Achieve personal growth; Improve writing, listening and speaking skills; Identify with positive role models; and Develop leadership skills. This program helps drive positive outcomes for youth in the Good Character & Citizenship area by recognizing and honoring youth who serve as positive role models, peer tutors and homework helpers, and foster outstanding character, leadership and service skills. The Club Youth of the Year serves as a spokesperson for media events and as an ambassador on the local and state levels. Idaho Legislative Services Offic e Page 4 of 7 MILLENNIUM 2016 GRANT Because the Youth of the Year initiative involves the entire Club, it serves as an environment to promote Good Character & Citizenship, civic engagement, and academic excellence through educational enrichment activities and programs and group leadership clubs. The Youth of the Year program is a mainstay of the Boys & Girls Club experience, and gives young people a voice and a path to showcase personal development. The program provides young people with the opportunity to show their Club, their community, their state, their region and the entire United States that they have developed into model citizens. Through essays and speeches, Youth of the Year candidates illustrate how they have turned their aspirations into actions and overcome personal obstacles to achieve success. Funding of this program by the Millennium Fund will allow us to expand the Youth of the Year Program at each Club level by allowing Club's to conduct a Youth of Month program, recognizing outstanding youth of all ages on a monthly basis (thereby creating a feeder program into Youth of the Year.) It will also provide additional funds for staffing, awards, program supplies and incentives, field trips and transportation, etc. related to the Youth of the Year Program.

Statement of Need According to the Substance Abuse Prevention Needs Assessment conducted by Prevention Idaho, Idaho residents use a number of different illicit substances. For Idaho's minor population, these substances include alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, depressants, tranquilizers, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamines, ecstasy, steroids, over-the-counter and prescription medications. According to the Idaho Substance Use, Safety, and School Climate Surveys administered by the Safe and Drug Free School office of the Idaho Department of Education from 2002/2003 - 2008/2009 (\"S&DFS survey\"), the three most common substances used by Idaho's minors are alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. Of the more than 15,000 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th grade respondents to the S&DFS survey in the most recent year for which data are available: 24.1% reported consuming alcohol in the 30 days prior to the survey. 11.9% reported using tobacco in the prior 30 days 9.9% indicated they had used marijuana in the same time period. Nearly 11% of the respondents reported using two substances in the 30 days prior to the survey. When multiple substances were reported, the common combinations always involved alcohol. The percentages of respondents, ages 11-18 , reporting 30-day use of the most common substances are shown in Table below. Because of alcohol's popularity among Idaho's minors and because it was almost always involved if more than one drug was reported, it was used as the primary indicator of substance use and substance abuse prevention ne ed. Alcohol 24.14% Tobacco 11.91% Marijuana 9.90% Ecstasy 2.12% Cocaine 1.53% Methamphetamines 0.90% It should be noted that the percentages for alcohol and tobacco use by high school age youth specifically are nearly double to those shown above. According to the CDC, following are influences that have been demonstrated to affect tobacco use among young people: o Low socioeconomic status o Lack of skills to resist influences to tobacco use o Lack of parental support or involvement o Accessibility, availability, and price of tobacco products o Low levels of academic achievement o Low self-image or self-esteem o Exposure to tobacco advertising Because of youth demographics and prevention-based programming at the Boys & Girls Clubs, we are uniquely positioned to positively impact the kids who are most vulnerable in our community. The Boys & Girls Club's Teen Empower Program is a multi-faceted approach to reducing the likelihood of abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs by at-risk \"tweens\" and Teens, ages 11 through 18, who are served by Boys & Girls Clubs in Idaho. With a focus instilling good character and citizenship through Club and Community service, reinforcing positive behaviors through a strong recognition process, and developing positive relationships with adults and peers, the Teen Empowerment Program offers an evidence-based approach to prevention. V. Project Design Each of the 11 Club sites throughout Idaho will offer components of the Torch Club, Keystone Club and the Youth of Year Program year-round, with a goal of serving a total of 600 youth throughout the grant period. At a minimum, Torch Club and Keystone Club members will meet monthly with the goal of planning, implementing and participating in at least one Club or Community Service Project each month. All Clubs will recognize outstanding youth of all ages Idaho Legislative Services Offic e Page 6 of 7 MILLENNIUM 2016 GRANT through the Youth of the Month Program, and will advance one youth from their organization (age 14 to 16) to Idaho Youth of the Year Competition in February 2016 . VI. Grant Management The Clubs in Idaho are well organized, financially stable, and positioned to do even more for the young people in Idaho. Building on the skills that our professional staff have developed through years of experience and training working with high risk youth, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Idaho proposes a 12 month project that will take place in 10 Idaho communities. Club staff, volunteers, youth peer leaders, Club members and their parents will work as a team to plan and implement the various components of the Teen Empowerment Program. To accomplish our goals each Boys & Girls Club organization will hire, train and/or assign qualified staff member(s) to plan and implement the Teen Empowerment Program. The responsibilities of the Teen Empower Program staff will be to manage all aspects of the program including: Recruiting participants Scheduling and facilitating programs Serve as a staff advisor in the planning and implementing of Club/community events Record-keeping Evaluation of the program and compilation of year-end report. The Teen Empowerment staff will be supervised by the Program Director, and will be responsible for mentoring youth and implementing programs. The Executive Directors from each Boys & Girls Club organization will be responsible for the oversight of the Teen Empowerment Program and will actively monitor the progress and achievements under this grant. The staff and Board of Directors from each Club will be responsible for raising matching funds and funds to sustain this program beyond the grant period. VII. Evaluation Plan As the world becomes even more interconnected, it is more critical than ever for our young people to develop the skills needed to compete in a global economy. By implementing the Teen Empowerment Program, we have the ability to reach 600 Idaho youth, ages 11-18, to provide them with the skills to: Demonstrate good character through civic engagement experiences and giving. Build partnerships with peers, parents and other community agencies to identify and combat risk behaviors. Promote positive peer- to-peer leadership and mentoring skills in the Club and community. Resist being involved in risky behaviors such as tobacco, alcohol drugs, etc. As part of Boys & Girls Clubs of America's National Youth Outcomes Initiative, an online survey tool has been developed to assist clubs in assessing the impact we are having on the youth we serve. The survey provides critical data as to the progress we are making to help kids avoid risky behaviors, improving academic achievement, encouraging healthy lifestyles and developing them into caring adults who make giving back a priority. At the end of the grant period, a minimum of 150 Club youth , ages 13 through 18 will be surveyed and data will be gathered to determine: % of youth who have abstained from smoking in the past year (goal 85%) % of youth who have abstained from drugs in the past year (goal 90%) % of youth who have abstained from alcohol in the past year (goal 80 %) % of youth who have participated in Club or Community Service at least once per month (goal: 50%) Idaho Legislative Services Offic e Page 7 of 7 MILLENNIUM 2016 GRANT VIII. Sustainability Very few organizations are as effective at leveraging support from the private sector as the Boys & Girls Clubs. Armed with research, p roven results, and strong brand awareness, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Idaho will seek additional support from individual investors, corporations, and foundations to continue serving the kids who need us most. The Idaho Clubs have an annual combined budget of $5,786,710, over 80% of which is raised through community support. IX.

Box 738 Boise, ID 83701 www.IdahoMethProject.org October 17, 2014 JOINT MILLENNIUM FUND COMMITTEE Room C305, State Capitol Boise, Idaho 83720 Dear Joint Millennium Fund Committee: It is my pleasure to submit a grant application for funding for the Idaho Meth Project through the Millennium Fund. Please find the required materials included wi th this cover letter. On behalf of the Idaho Meth Project staff and board, we appreciate your consider ation of our application. The Idaho Meth Project is a larg escale, statewide prevention p rogram aimed at preventing and reducing teen Meth use through public service messaging, education and c ommunity outreach. The centerpiece of the program is researchbased advertising that graphically comm unicates the risks of Meth use. The program is based on the Meth Pro ject model, which was first imp lemented in Montana in 2005 and is currently running in six states. The goal of the Project is to ensure that Idaho's youth are aware of the dangers of methamphetamine use by emphasizing the NOT EVEN ONCE message. By reaching teens before they ever try the drug, we can significantly impact Meth 's destructive effects on our state. The Idaho Meth Project reach es teens in Idaho through: Digital advertising that targets teens where they live today - online. This includes virtual billboards, video and audio ads, clickable calls to action and games. Over 200 free school and community presentations utilizing the information available at MethProject.org, as well as pers onal stories from former Meth a ddicts. Over 60 community events like \"No t Even Once Nights\" at local f airs, driveins, pools, and other places where teens can congregate in a safe and drug free envir onment Training teachers to utilize the resources and lesson plans ava ilable at MethProject.org. As a small statewide nonprofit, it is a challenge to continue o ur aggressive outreach efforts while also responding to the growing needs and requests of parents, teachers, members of law enforcement, and other community members. To assist in our efforts and grow them even further, we are requesting $343,700 to support the following: 1. Extend Idaho Meth Project's efforts in community and school edu cation programs. This includes: a. strengthening our relapse prevention efforts, b. extending the Idaho Meth Project s' message in Idaho's smaller, more rural areas by implementing a shortterm contractor program, and c. fulfilling the existing persiste ntly increasing demand the Meth Prevention Lesson and resource in Idaho secondary schools. 2. Supplement our digital media efforts by expanding our radio cam paign to keep Meth prevention in the forefront of family dinner conversations. 3. Create the state's fir st coordinated teen facing prescription d rug campaign. Idaho Meth Project 1.888.331.2060 P.O. Box 738 Boise, ID 83701 www.IdahoMethProject.org As a statewide substance abuse p revention organization with a s trong prevention strategy, well recognized branding, respect amo ng teens, and solid relationshi ps throughout the state of Idaho, we believe we can continue to not only keep Meth use low despite a rising supply of the drug, but we can use our strengths to help address the growing prescription drug issue. Millennium Fund support is crucia l in demonstrating to our priv ate partners that the State of Idaho is behind our efforts. Both public and private funding sources wor k in tandem to help ensure that Idaho continues to recognize the impor tance of substance abuse preven tion and take action to support it. Thank you again for your thought ful consideration of our reques t. We appreciate all you do for Idaho.

We also launched an interactive website that has helped demystify the information Idaho's youth have about Meth. FY 2013 Report Project Outcomes Over 16,500 students and 77 schools were educated by the Meth Prevention Lesson (MPL) 52% of school presentations were conducted in rural communities Sent the MPL to secondary school in Idaho We reached an extensive amount of Idaho teens: Display: 7,581,710 Impressions/Clicks Facebook aided visits to MethProject.org FY 2015 Request The Idaho Meth Project Requests $343,700 to Support: 1.Extending our efforts in community and school education programs 2.Supplementing our digital media efforts by expanding our radio campaign to keep Meth prevention in the forefront of family dinner conversations 3.Creating the state's first coordinated teen -facing prescription drug campaign Wakefield Study: Prevalence Rates Idaho teens are most likely to try drugs when they are 14 or 15. But experimentation with some of the more accessible drugs - like OTC cough medicine - can happen as early as age 10 or younger. 86% of teens in Idaho recognize there is at least moderate risk in trying meth just once or twice, but only 77% believe there's great risk. This means that nearly a quarter of Idaho teens (23%) don't see great risk in trying meth. Even more so than meth, 40% of Idaho teens think it's easy to get prescription drugs without a prescription. Teens know these pills can be found in any medicine cabinet in any home. They'll always be easy to get. And if taken from someone's medicine cabinet, they're free . Over half (54%) of Idaho teens know where to go to get meth if they wanted it. And 24% think they can get it from a friend. 10% of teens say their friends have used meth. And even more (29%) say their friends have taken prescription drugs without a prescription. Wakefield Study: Teen Perceptions 86% of teens in Idaho recognize there is at least moderate risk in trying meth just once or twice, but only 77% believe there's great risk. This means that nearly a quarter of Idaho teens (23%) don't see great risk in trying meth. In Idaho, most parents (87%) have discussed drugs with their teens. But the focus of these conversations is never meth, prescription drugs, or other very serious drugs. They're usually only about alcohol (84%) and marijuana (74%). 66% of parents have discussed meth with their teens, and 54% have talked to them about the risks of taking prescription pills without a prescription. These may seem like substantial numbers, but they aren't big enough . Wakefield Study: Teen Perceptions Idaho teens don't believe most of the more common effects of using meth, but some effects are more believable than others: 34% of Idaho teens believe meth helps you lose weight 28% of Idaho teens believe meth makes you feel euphoric or very happy 28% of Idaho teens believe meth gives you energy 22% of Idaho teens believe meth helps you deal with boredom 14% of Idaho teens believe meth helps you escape your problems Wakefield Study: Gauging Awareness Nearly every teen in Idaho (95%) has seen or heard of \"Not Even Once\" anti-meth ads. The most prevalent places students view our message are in school (77%) or on TV (75%), and the internet (62%). Almost all Idaho teens aware of \"Not Even Once\" anti -meth ads say they make them less likely to try or use meth (94%). This proves the ads are working. To reach more teens, we must run the ads more frequently. 15% of Idaho teens have not heard of the Idaho Meth Project. This shows a clear opportunity to increase our outreach efforts, and develop creative ways to reach even more teens - especially when you consider that nearly all teens who've heard of the Idaho Meth Project feel it's had an impact on them. 44% of teens who've heard of the Idaho Meth Project have not seen a presentation about it in school. About one-quarter (23%) of Idaho teens have visited methproject.org.

Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 7 IDAHOMETHPROJECT MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 IV. Statement of Need The face of meth is changing in Idaho. Most of the meth in Idaho is now trafficked in by way of the Mexican drug cartels. While there are many benefits to having fewer \"meth houses,\" importing it now means that meth is more potent, more available, and more affordable than ever. It is not uncommon to find 2 grams of methamphetamine (approximately 20 hits to the new meth user) for $10-50 in Idaho. In order for us to continue to see the downward trajectory Idaho has enjoyed since the creation of the Idaho Meth Project, it is imperative now more than ever that we continue to spread the important Not Even Once message. In order to gauge the efficacy of the Idaho Meth Project and to measure drug attitudes in Idaho, we worked with Partnership at DrugFree.org and Wakefield to complete a survey in May of this year. The findings are staggering: Idaho teens are most likely to try drugs when they are 14 or 15. Over half (54%) of Idaho teens know where to go to get meth if they wanted it. And 24% think they can get it from a friend. 40% of Idaho teens think it's easy to get prescription drugs without a prescription. 77% of students heard our \"Not Even Once\" me ssage at school, more than any other source. o This means that our presence in Idaho schools is imperative to the mission of the Idaho Meth Project. Our school presentations are in high demand, and we have turned down twelve schools during the 2013-2014 school year. An astounding 15% of teens have not heard of the Idaho Meth Project, however nearly all teens (93%) who've heard of the Idaho Meth Project feel it's had an impact on them and 66% of them say it has helped them understand you can't try meth - not even once. o While not exclusively a barrier for the Idaho Meth Project, we struggle to reach students in the most rural parts of Idaho. We have done substantial school outreach to our less populated areas, however we know that the Not Even Once message resonates the loudest when it is part of a comprehen sive media, school, and community outreach campaign. While there have been substantial outreach and media campaigns for parents, healthcare workers, and law enforcement agencies from our substance abus e prevention partners, t here has been little to no message directly to teens about the dangers of prescription drug abuse. Moreover, almost all of the schools that we are currently partner ing with have asked us to present about this growing problem. Additionally, members of law enforcement have indicated to us that where one drug is found (Meth or prescription drugs), the other is usually also found. As the only substance abuse prevention nonprofit in Idaho that is working with principals and health teachers throughout the state, we are in the best position to help address this issue. V. Project Design To address these needs, the Idaho Meth Project will utilize Millennium Fund dollars to: 1. Extend our efforts in community and school education programs. Our community and school education programs are categorized into three goals: Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 7 IDAHOMETHPROJECT MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 Strengthen our relapse prevention efforts. This year, we have seen significant success in reaching out to the juvenile detention centers and youth drug courts. While many of these student s have missed our Not Even Once message the first time, presenting them with the Meth Preventi on Lesson gives these young people a framework and understanding to resist meth use once they have bee n released. This is key because many of these students are returning to little to no support from their parents. Goals and Objectives: This year, we were able to pres ent to four juvenile detention centers. Because of our existing relationships with law enforcement, we are confident we have the ability to increase to ten. In addition, we have been asked to present to both of the Idaho Youth ChalleNGe Academy (IDYCA) graduating classes. And lastly, we are going to organize four events for alternative high schools or students in the drug court program. We have found tremendous success in working with these students, since most end-of-s chool activities are focused on students in the traditional school setting. Measurement and Desired Outcome: We know that our message makes a significant impact on the students who encounter it. Once we are able to esta blish a history of presenting for multiple years and continuing to build relationships with the students and law enforcement agencies, we will be able to access whether students are reentering the system after they have heard the Meth Prevention Lesson. Extend the Idaho Meth Project's message in Idaho's smaller, more rural areas by implementing a short-term contractor program. Goals and Objectives: Working first with our local colleges and universities, we will contract with local contractors that places an Idaho Meth Project representative right in the communities of our seven districts. Each representative will be responsible for thirty community events during their contract. Measurement and Desired Outcome: This program give s us the reach into the most remote parts of Idaho to ensure that every student regardless of wh at their zip code is has the opportunity to hear the Not Even Once message. This program w ill result in a presence at 210 events. Fulfill the existing and persistently increasing dem and for the Meth Prevention Lesson and resources in Idaho secondary schools. Goals and Objectives: With these funds, we will be ab le to present the Meth Prevention Lesson to the current 12 schools we have had to turn down. We already have the infrastructure and man-power to fulfill these requests, we simply do not have the funds available. Measurement and Desired Outcome: We will measure success on the number of Meth Prevention Lessons we are able to present. More often than not, these requests come from our larger school district health classes. We will see the number of students we have been able to reach increase due to this appropriation. 2. Supplement our digital medi a efforts by expanding our radio campaign to keep Meth prevention in the forefront of family dinner conversations. While we know we are reaching a significant amount of Idaho teens through our digital media campaign, Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 7 IDAHOMETHPROJECT MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 we also recognize the need to supplement with additional traditional media. We hear stories from all over Idaho that it is our traditional media outreach that creates opportunities fo r parents to talk to their teens, where a digital \"impression\" is typically made in isolation. While many of our teens have moved away from televi sion and print media, we know the vast majority of them are still consuming radio. According to the Tapscan Spring 2014 Arbitron Survey, 86.2% of teens between the ages of 12-17 in the Boise market are regular listeners of radio. Goals and Objectives: We will conduct a radio campaign to saturate each of the seven markets with our Not Even Once message. These radio spots are already produced, so the funds will be used solely for placement. We will also use our Teen Advisory Counc il as a focus group to ens ure the ads are \"fresh\" and still applicable to today's youth. Measurement and Desired Outcome: We will gauge success by the number of ads we are able to place. We will rely on reports from each vendor to determine if we are getting the desired statewide saturation based on our targeted demographics. 3. Create the state's first coordinate d teen-facing prescription drug campaign. Goals and Objectives: In response to the overwhel ming demand from local teachers, administrators, and parents, and in partnership with other substance abus e organizations, the Idaho Meth Project will create a two-pronged approach to the prescription drug abuse epidemic in Idaho. First, in response to local request, we will launch a school and community outreach campaign, modeled after the Idaho Meth Project approach. This will include production of an interactive school present ation, recruitment of compelling speakers, and a visible, statewide, teen initiated outreach event, similar to the \"Paint the State\" campaign. Second, we know school and community outreach cam paigns become exponentially more effective when wrapped with a well-developed media campaign. Fo llowing the Montana example, we will produce a radio campaign with statewide saturation using indivi duals who are coping with former prescription drug addiction. We will also provide a website who will serve as a valuable clearinghouse of resources for teens and parents. Measurement and Desired Outcome: We will measure our success by student pre- and post-presentation evaluations of their attitudes on various harms associ ated with drug abuse and increase the overall belief of \"great risk\" to over 85%. We also want to see a significant participation in our statewide teen event to over 30 youth groups participating. We can track this through the use of hashtags on our social media outlets. We will rely on reports from each of our ra dio vendors to determine if we are getting the desired statewide saturation based on our targeted demographics. VI. Grant Management The Idaho Meth Project's Executive Director provides the overall leadership, guidance, and management of the Idaho Meth Project to ensure fulfillment of t he project's mission and effective implementation of its community action programs. The Exec utive Director works collaboratively with staff, contract employees, the Board and Advisory Council, and community stakeh olders. The Executive Director is responsible for administrative, financial, and programmatic managem ent of the Idaho Meth Project, and will ultimately be Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 7 IDAHOMETHPROJECT MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 responsible for the appropriate usage of Millennium Fund grant dollars. In addition to the Executive Director, the Idaho Meth Project has two full-time employees - a Director of Education and Development and a Program Coordinator. The Director of Education will schedule 100% of all school presentations, and will conduct about 50% of them herself. She will also train teachers to utilize our available materials (e xisting Meth Prevention Lesson and new prescrip tion drug abuse materials). The Program Coordinator will schedule community event participati on, supervise community outreach contractors, and will ensure that peer-to-pee r conversations about Meth and prescription drug abuse are the primary goal of these events. Both em ployees work to recruit and train volunteers that assist with school presentat ions and community events. Finally, the Executive Director has direct access to the leadership skills, expertise, and guidance provided by our Board and Advisory Council members. Thos e private and public sector professionals are: Board of Directors: Debbie Field (Board President), First Lady Lori O tter, Steve Pasierb,(CEO of the Partnership at DrugFree.org), James Adamson (CEO of Mountain View Hospital), and Darrell Calton (Market General Manager for Boise's Impact Radio Group) Advisory Council: Representative Kelly Packer , Mayor Tammy de Weerd, Shawna West, Heidi Otto, Ben Wolfinger VII. Evaluation Plan We will continue to evaluate our success through t he Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the School Climate Survey, and through our own survey methods. We recently worked with the Partnership at DrugFree.org and partnered with Wakefield to conduct an extensive evaluation survey of the Idaho Meth Project which has been referenced throughout this application. We will continue to work with Wakefield to gauge the effectiveness of our work. VIII. Sustainability As the only nonprofit in Idaho dedicated to Me th education and prevention, and one of the few organizations with direct access to teens in schools, the Idaho Meth Project fills a very important need in Idaho. The Millennium Fund is a crucial component to this Project, but have a proven track record of finding and maintaining outside sources of income. We never rely solely on Millennium Fund dollars, however they have become an incredible asset in helpi ng the Idaho Meth Project continue to grow and adapt to the needs of Idahoans. The Idaho Meth Project's Board and Advisory Council me mbership include leaders at the highest level of the public and private sectors of our state. These individuals are familiar with the effect this drug has on families and the communities they serve and live in; and they have committed their time, talent, and treasure toward the success of the Idaho Meth Projec t. As the Idaho Meth Project continues to evolve through new messaging and communication strategies driven by enhanced technologies, we will continue to provide educational services for as long as there are teens in Idaho who could fall prey to the crippling effects of methamphetamine use and prescription drug abuse.

As of the due date for this application, the survey results have not been released, how ever they will be released to the public prior to the Millennium Fund Committee presentations. An ex tensive summary will be provided to the Committee at the presentation. The Idaho Meth Project and our anti-meth adverti sements like \"Not Even Once\" are working and are reaching teens. That's why teens are w illing to acknowledge that our programs have helped them see the dangers of meth. However, we must continue to search for new and creative ways to reach teens - so every teen has an opportunity to learn just how dangerous meth and prescription drug abuse can be. National Institute on Drug Abuse (2003). Prevention Principles. In Preventing Drug Use among Children and Adolescents (In Brief). http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications /preventing-drug-abuse-among- children-adolescents-in-brief/prevention-principles (Full study can be found at http://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/redbook_0.pdf ) This paper outlines sixteen principles of prevent ion drug use in teens. Of particular interest are the sections referring to school and community programs and prevention program delivery. Idaho Legislative Services Office Addendum WAKEFIELD STUDY SUMMARY Overview Since 2007, Idaho has seen a 56% decrease in teen methamphetamine use. Idaho teens are most likely to try drugs when they are 14 or 15. But experimentation with some of the more accessible drugs - like OTC cough medicine - can happen as early as age 10 or younger. When it comes to teaching kids about the risks of drugs, parents can be a big help. In Idaho, most parents have talked to their teens about drugs. But those conversations tend to focus on alcohol and marijuana. Virtually every teen who's seen these ads says they make them less likely to try meth - so we know they are working. Just about all Idaho teens have heard of the Idaho Meth Pro ject. And, similar to the \"Not Even Once\" ads, those who are familiar say it's had an impact on them. For example, Idaho teens say the ads have made them more aware of the risks of using meth. In spite of these positive signs, there are still some teens yet to be exposed to the Idaho Meth Project. Prevalence Rates for Teen Substance Abuse Nearly half of teens (49%) have been offered drugs. But only 6% have been offered meth. Even though we know half of those who have been offered meth have tried it, this is still a small number. That said, 21% of Idaho teens think it's easy to find meth. And as long as half of teens who are being offered the drug are trying it, this is a concern. 86% of teens in Idaho recognize there is at least moderate risk in trying meth just once or twice, but only 77% believe there's great risk. This means that nearly a quarter of Idaho teens (23%) don't see great risk in trying meth. Even more so than meth, 40% of Idaho teens think it's easy to get prescription drugs without a prescription. Teens know these pills can be found in any medicine cabinet in any home. They'll always be easy to get. And if taken from someone's medicine cabinet, they're free. Over half (54%) of Idaho teens know where to go to get meth if they wanted it. And 24 % think they can get it from a friend. 10% of teens say their friends have used meth. And even more (29%) say their friends have taken prescription drugs without a prescription. Teen Perceptions Regarding Substance Abuse 86% of teens in Idaho recognize there is at least moderate risk in trying meth just once or twice, b ut only 77% believe there's great risk. This means that nearly a quarter of Idaho teens (23%) don't see great risk in trying meth. In Idaho, most parents (87%) have discussed drugs with their teens. But the focus of these conversations is never meth, prescription drugs, or other very serious drugs. They're usually only about alcohol (84%) and marijuana (74%). 66% of parents have discussed meth with their teens, and 54% have talked to them about the risks of taking prescription pills without a prescription. These may seem like substantial numbers, but they aren't big enough. Idaho teens don't believe most of the more common effects of u sing meth, but some effects are more believable than others: o 34% of Idaho teens believe meth helps you lose weight o 28% of Idaho teens believe meth makes you feel euphoric or very happy o 28% of Idaho teens believe meth gives you energy o 22% of Idaho teens believe meth helps you deal with boredom o 14% of Idaho teens believe meth helps you escape your problems Gauging Awareness Nearly every teen in Idaho (95%) has seen or heard of \"Not Even Once\" anti -meth ads. The most prevalent places students view our message are in school (77%) or on TV (75%), and the internet (62%). Additionally, 66% of Idaho teens who've heard of the Idaho Meth Project say it has helped them understand you can't try meth - even once. Almost all Idaho teens aware of \"Not Even Once\" anti -meth ads say they make them less likely to try or use meth (94%). This proves the ads are working. To reach more teens, we must run the ads more frequently. 15% of Idaho teens have not heard of the Idaho Meth Project. This shows a clear opportunity to increase our outreach efforts, and develop creative ways to reach even more teens - especially when you consider that nearly all teens who've heard of the Idaho Meth Project feel it's had an impact on them (93%). 44% of teens who've heard of the Idaho Meth Project have not seen a presentation about it in school. We know this project has left an impact on nearly every teen who has heard of it - so by sharing the program's message in more schools, we can influence even more teens. About o ne-quarter (23%) of Idaho teens have visited methproject.org. Methodological Notes The Partnership at Drugfree.org survey was conducted by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com) between February 18th and April 2nd among 2401 teenagers, ages 12-17, from Georgia and Idaho. This document includes the results among the 600 teens from Idaho only. Interviews were collected using a phone recruit and an online survey. The margin of error for this study is +/- 4.0 percentage points.

Rationale or Justification for Project: The Idaho Meth Project made tremendous strides in changing attitudes about the dangers of Meth among Idaho's yout h. Since the launch of the Project, teen Meth use declined dramatically in Idaho. Between 2007 and 2009, teen Meth use in Idaho declined by 52% and continued to remain low according to the CDC's 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) despite a rise in supply of the drug, predominantly from Mexico. Based on our 2010 Idaho Meth Use & Attitudes Survey: 65% of teens saw \"great risk\" in tr ying Meth; 65% of teens took action by telling their friends not to use Meth; and 92% of teens would have wanted a friend or sibling to see or hear an Idaho Meth Project advertisement if they were thinking about trying Meth. Project Summary : The Idaho Meth Project's request for a Millennium Fund grant was two-fold: First, in keeping with Idaho Health Education Standards, the Idaho Meth Project piloted an online Meth Prevention Lesson for the Classroom that focused on educating our primary target age group (12 to 17) on the consequences of Meth use. The Meth Prevent ion Lesson was developed with the help of school curriculum experts and is currently was piloted by middle and high school teachers. The premise of the Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 3 IDAHOMETHPROJECT MILLENNIUMFUND _REPORTFY14 online Meth Prevention Lesson was two-fold: (1) to elicit students' prior knowledge of Meth use; and (2) to set a purpose for learning. In November 2011, the Idaho Meth Project launched an interactive website that has helped demystify the information Idaho's youth have about Meth. It enables si te visitors to post their impressions, knowledge, and experiences with the drug, as well as engage in di scussions with their peers . And it is a definitive source of information about the dangers and risks of methamphetamine use. The site shows specific ways teens can \"Speak Up,\" \"Take Action,\" and \"Share\" their own ideas with other teens. Geographic Area Covered: Millennium Fund dollars helped the Idaho Meth Project reach Idaho teens across the state. In 2013, 52% of school present ations were conducted in rural communities. Project Outputs: With the assistance from the Millennium Fund, we were able to reach teens by: Display: 7,581,710 Impressions/Clicks Facebook developed and produced the Meth Prevention le sson which was sent to every health teacher in the state of Idaho. In 2013, 16,380 students and over 70 schools were educated by the Meth Prevention Lesson. Project Outcomes : According to YRBS data released this year, teen Meth use in Idaho has declined 56% since 2007. Additionally, our media camp aign drove 54,791 Idahoans to learn more at MethProject.org.

This was done to reflect the same time period in which the grant was used. The slight budget variance over 5% is due to the guidelines we have from our federal grant. We have strict limits on where those grant dollars can be spent, even down to what vendors we can use for each service. Because we cannot use federal dollars on community and school outreach, for example, a small variance can occur between our revenue and our expenses.

Pl ease consider our application and review some of our innovativ e ideas on how to empower the at-risk youth in our state. The primary goal of the Canyon Springs Youth C ourt is to act as a pilot program for all interested high schools to implement Youth/P eer Courts and Self Discovery Internship within their own schools. We st rive to use positive peer pr essure to ensure that young people who have committed minor offenses pay back the community and receive the help they need to avoid further involvement in the justice system. The youth court also seeks to provide a reliable and fa ir diversion option for the justice system agencies that participate with cases referred to the progr am. We also believe that when you empower youth to make decisions and give them tools to begin to understand what their personal strengths are, you begin to shape a future that makes sense and sets them up for success after high school.

According to the Federal Government (USA): 93% of youth justice programs in the U.S. require youth to admit guilt prior to participating in youth court. In the 7% of youth justice programs that allow youth to plead \"not guilty\", if a youth chooses to plead \"not guilty\", the progra m conducts a hearing to determine guilt or innocence. If the defendant is found \"guilty,\" then an appropriate disposition is re ndered by the youth justice program. When defendants successfully complete a youth justice program, 63% of youth justice programs dismiss the charges. 27% immediately expunge the defendant's record.

IV. Statement of Need Canyon Springs High School is the lowest one start school in the state of Idaho. As we work to restructure our programs we have analyzed the needs of the school in a variety of ways. Our students come to us with a variety of issues that caused them to not be successful in traditional school settings. The most common reason students are labeled at risk in our community is they have issues with substance abuse and gang activity. We are a very at risk population that is in need of additional resources that will provide students with additional education, treatment options, and outlets to prevent abuse. As a school we recognize the need for more resources that target the basic needs of our students so that they are able to ta ke advantage of a safe environment at school and learn. In order for a student to reach self-actualization their basic needs must be met. With a high level of poverty and a prevalent culture of drug use and abuse, many of our students are lacking the basic needs an individual requires to be successful in a school setting. Thro ugh the implementation of this program we intend to attach resources to individuals with a focus on getti ng our students in a position that they are able to attend and glean from the education that we are prov iding them at Canyon Springs High School. Quick Stats: In a random poll at Canyon Spring s High School the following question were asked. Have you ever smoked marijuana? 84% yes Have you ever drank alcohol? 78% yes Have you ever tried meth? 54% yes Has anyone in your immediate family ever gone to prison or jail? 100% yes Do you know anyone who is dealing right now? 78% yes Has anyone in your immediate family died from drugs, suicide or gang violence? 78% yes If you had the opportunity to deal drugs one time for $1000 dollars would you do it? 84% yes Do you think Self Discovery and a game plan for your future would help you get out of your current situation? 90% yes V. Project Design Youth court model Youth judge: Youth court members assume the roles of jurors, judge and advocates. In this model, the advocates conduct the questioning of respondents (similar to a conventional court). Jurors listen to the testimony, deliberate and assign sanction(s). This model allows for use of a larger jury pool of youth court participants who are not fully trained members, and requires a smaller number of fully trained members to be present at each hearing. The model also allows jury duty to be one of the sanctions for respondents. Referrals and cases School-based youth courts hear cases of disciplinar y violations that would otherwise result in detention, suspension, or other sanctions; cases can be referred by the vice principal, counselor, school safety officer. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Goals Canyon Springs Youth Court serves as both early intervention for young people charged with low-level offenses (\"respondents\") and as leadership development programs for the youths who serve on the court (\"members\"). The primary goal of the Canyon Springs Youth Court is to use positive peer pressure to ensure that young people who have committed minor offenses pay back the community and receive the help they Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16 need to avoid further involvement in the justice system . The youth court also seeks to provide a reliable and fair diversion option for the justice system agenci es that participate with cases referred to the program. We work to achieve this goal through the following: Service For Members and Jurors : Our goal is to teach the value of civic duty through volunteering and service to our community. For Respondents: We ask respondents to repair the harm done to the community through service projects. We work closely with our pa rtners to ensure that young people are exposed to the value of volunteering and the importanc e of voluntary service to one's community. Accountability Our goal is to teach respondents the importance of accepting one's role in a situation; of accepting the things within one's control; and of being accountable to the community and to themselves. The focus is on reflection and choice. Professionalism Our goal is to teach members job readiness skills such as interviewing skills , performance reviews, conduct at a workplace, public speaking, and notice (re: conflicts, absences, etc.). Leadership For Respondents: Our goal is to assist respondents in making better choices for themselves in the future. Every interaction with a respondent emphasizes ownership of choice and opportunity for reflection. For Members: Our goal is to develop leadership skills in the young people we work with through a bi-annual training program and on-going develop ment efforts such as giving and receiving constructive feedback among peers. Community Partners Government agencies: Canyon County Juvenile Probation, Canyon County Juvenile Prosecutor, City of Caldwell Prosecutor, Caldwell School District #132, Caldwell Police Department Sanctions (Depending on offense) N-O-T on Tobacco - A state of the art program specifically designed for teenagers who want to stop smoking. N-O-T helps teens stop smok ing or reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke. Drug and Alcohol Counseling/Child/Parent - Offered at Canyon Springs High School by A Fresh Start Counseling Services as well as NNU master's program students. Community Service Hours - In conjunction with Canyon County Juvenile Probation. Family Advocates Home Visits - for student parents who need extra help with preparing for a baby or support at home. Grief Counseling - Many of our students have one or more parents who are deceased. This causes many underlying issues that until dealt with will continue to deter students. Provided by A Fresh Start Counseling Service at Canyon Springs High School. Anger Management - Offered by NNU master's program students at Canyon Springs High School after school hours. Essays : Ex: Future behavior, victim apologies, where the want to go to college? Peer Mentoring: Each respondent is designated a \"Peer Mentor\" who meets with them weekly on behavior, attendance, grades and sanctions completed. Self Discovery Internship- The Self-Discovery Internship is a revolutionary so lution for those making major educational and career decisions that will set the pace for their futures. T he virtual internship teaches participants what they need to know before they take that first promising coll ege scholarship, internship or job, helping them avoid distractions and misguided efforts that would draw them away from where their true abilities lie. Applied within a school setting, the internship will instill edu cational institutions with competitive advantages that will translate into enhanced engagement from students leading to higher graduation rates.

Evaluation Plan Operational data: We use two Excel spreadsheets to track program data Referrals, cases and respondents: This file include s all case data, including referral sources, type of offense, sanctions assigned, and sanction m onitoring. It is updated after every referral and intake; immediately post-hearing when sanctions are assigned; and as sanctions are completed. Members: This file includes information about trainees as well as members. Once trainees become members, it is used to track their attendance and lateness, role assignments and community service hours. Evaluation data: The Canyon Springs Youth Court uses the following evaluation tools: Member survey: We administer this survey the fi rst day of training and the last day of training. It takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The survey tracks changes in members' attitudes about the police, the court system, and laws, as well as in measures of civic engagement and feelings of efficacy. Respondent and Parent/Guardian surveys: The respondent and parent/guardian surveys immediately following hearings and collected befor e they leave. The surveys are designed to measure whether respondents and parents/guardia ns thought the process and sanctions were fair, whether they understood the process, and w hether they would recommend youth court to other young people and families. Reporting requirements: Canyon Springs Youth Court has the following repo rting requirements to our community partners: Canyon County Juvenile Probation: Every quarte r CSYC provides the following data: number of cases broken out by case type and referral sour ce, number of completed community service hours, number of members, and completion rate. Canyon County Juvenile Prosecutors Office: Annually, CSYC provides the following data upon request to this source the number of cases br oken out by case type, number of completed community service hours, and completion rate. VIII. Sustainability At the conclusion of the grant perio d schools that have been part of the pilot project will have all of the tools in place to sustain Peer Court. Through pr ogramming, training, and the solidifying of community partnerships this program is sustainable with a mi nimal amount of funding that can and should be picked Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 6 MILLENNIUMFUND_GRANTFY16 up by local LEA's. The benefit of this program to the schools that are selected will be valuable enough that they will and can sustain the program without further funding. IX. Evidence-Based Research http://www.youthcourt.net Program Effectiveness According to the Urban Institute's Evaluatio n of Teen Courts Project , which was based on four teen court programs studied in four different states (Alaska, Maryland, Arizona, and Missouri), the six-month recidivism figures among the programs ranged from 6% to 9%. http://www.globalyouthjustice.org/STATISTICS.html Youth Justice Program Functions The primary function of most youth justice programs is to determine a fair and restorat ive sentence or disposition for the youth respondent. According to the Federal Government (USA): o 93% of youth justice programs in the U.S. require youth to admit gu ilt prior to participating in youth court. o In the 7% of youth justice programs that allow yo uth to plead \"not guilty\", if a youth chooses to plead \"not guilty\", the program conducts a hearing to determine guilt or innocence. If the defendant is found \"guilty,\" then an appropriate dispositi on is rendered by the youth justice program. o When defendants successfully complete a youth just ice program, 63% of youth justice programs dismiss the charges. 27% immediatel y expunge the defendant's record.

The virtual internship teaches participants what they need to know before they take that fir st promising college scholarship, internship or job, helping them avoid distractions and misguided efforts that would draw them away from where their true abilities lie. Applied within a school setting, the internship will instill educational institutions with competitive advantages that will translate into enhanced engagement from students lea ding to higher graduation rates. 1 Current Situation The Self-Discovery Internship provides schools an easier and less time intensive solution to help their students identify what they are good at, boost motivation, increase optimism, build confidence, find a sense of direction and become more aware of their potential for excellence. With minimal opportunities for 15 to 18 year olds to gain valuable work experience when they need it the most, it is critical schools introduce a solution that will help students take advantage of the invisible window of opportunity found by Tim Judge and Charlice Hurst during their 2008 study at the University of Florida. They found a small window to boost confidence and increase job satisfaction for life (14-23 yrs old). The result of hitting the window is increased income and physical health over a lifetime. The long list of data related to our youth missing this window is well-documented, and includes the waste and loss of precious time, limited resources, and valuable capital. Each statistic carries daunting burdens economically and emotionally, affecting each of us in our homes and communities, in every State around the country. Unfortunately the trends continue to show a moving target between what employers expect, what colleges promise, and what the next generation of students will accep t: Colleges turn from self-discovery to job preparation . Millennials want more than just a paycheck; they crave meaningful and fulfilling careers , maybe even a chance to change the world. The summer internship used to be an opportunity to dabble and see what you like; but, if you don't get that summer internship, it can be much harder to line up a position at graduation; it's a \" try before you buy \" method of hiring. The aim is the creation of a richer chan nel set and pool of potential students / interns / employees for organizations. Many organizations complain that the hiring process is too open and labor intensive. The Self - Discovery Internship is positioned to help organizations more quickly identify the most driven, talented, and qualified cand idates for internships and jobs by making the students and employees more savvy. Copyright 2014 HSCI, LLC Self-Discovery Internship Oct/2014 Page 4 of 8 2 Solution The Self-Discovery Internship helps students get better prepared to make the transition into the real world. Implementing the internships short daily lessons over a school year will teach participants how to ignite their passion, activate their potential, and leverage their talents to benefit their futures. They possess great potential value to the local economy and to the organizations that will employ them, a nd the internship will train them on how to uncover their potential, and to apply it within real world circumstances . Doing so will empower them to navigate their way through the roadblocks that have so many people stuck, disengaged, and dissatisfied with their circumstances. Ultimately, the internship can change the outcome of a student's future by getting them more prepared for the realities of the world we live in: Over hal f of the young American students (53%) surveyed in 2010 (aged 10 -18) are hopeful, possessing numerous ideas and abundant energy for the future. The remaining students are stuck (31%) or discouraged (16%), lacking the ideas and energy they need to navigate problems and reach goals (Gallup, 2010). About 23% of s tudents are not engaged \u2014 going through the motions at school. Those students who are actively disengaged (14%) are likely undermining the teaching and learning process for themselves and others (Gallup, 2010) 42% of the American popula tion say they are 'struggling' (Gallup, 2014). According to Gallup (2008) , the vast majority of people around the world do not have \"the opportunity to do what they do best every day\" in their current job ( America 32%, China 14 %). Only 13% of employees worldwide are engaged at work, according to Gallup's new 142 -country study on the State of the Global Workplace (Gallup, 2013). As of 2014, there are rough ly 22,000,000 unemployed people in America (7%). As of 2014, there are roughly 52,000,000 people (1 out of every 6) seeking a change in employment annually in America due to separation from their companies. As of 2014, roughly 17% of the American workforce (49,000,000) declare themselves as underemployed. Copyright 2014 HSCI, LLC Self-Discovery Internship Oct/2014 Page 5 of 8 2.1 Objectives The competition is fierce as the roadblocks are stunting the growth of people, of all ages, all over the world. Knowing these obstacles lie ahead for students, the internships objectives are to help students: Objective 1: Discover the core components of identity , Objective 2: Put a language to their talents, Objective 3: Encourage them to plan their education and career around their talents, Objective 4: Teach them how to apply their talents in core employment functions, Objective 5: Teach them how to navigate through common talent inhibitors, and Objective 6: Teach them how to multiply and then leverage their talents to benefit their communities. The curriculum is a very select compilation of modern day literature, programs, and technology from today's most regarded thought leaders, professional speakers and coaches (including the likes of Stedman Graham, George Gallup, and many others who have dedicated their lives to simplifying a way for people to achieve their full potential and make valuable contributions to society). 2.2 Approach The Self-Discovery Internship can be implemented in many ways to meet the needs of a school district (e.g., in class, summer school). At the present time the program is being implemented during a portion of the 'Home Room' time allotted at the beginning of each day. Schools can select to have teachers trained to lead a group discussion of the daily lessons and quizzes, or simply have the students take the internship on their own. The Superintendent or Principal may have a preference on the approach so teachers should follow their lead to ensure consistency. The internship takes advantage of the advancements in technology by permitting each student to participate using computers or i pads . All the lessons are accessible online so the students progress is tracked with ease. Workbooks are used for the student to record the information they learn about themselves throughout the internship (online versions coming soon). The workbooks become a valuable reference tool for them (and their career counselors) into the future as they pursue their careers. Additionally, teachers can show parents glimpses of what their student is learning during Parent Teacher Conferences by referencing these workbooks. This will help build the parents trust in their students ability to make decisions about their future. At the end of the day the Self-Discovery Internship has the potential to turn teachers and career counselors into world class mentors. Plus, the data gathered from students will empower the school, local universities, and community officials to better support students into the future beyond graduation. Copyright 2014 HSCI, LLC Self-Discovery Internship Oct/2014 Page 6 of 8 2.3 Benefits The Self-Discovery Internship instills students with competitive advantages that translate into: An increased understanding of their own unique value as individuals (enhanced motivation, optimism, confidence, direction), Enhanced ability to sell their value to prospective employers, Better career selections to match their talents (more productivity, less sick days, and less job turnover), Increased performance during future internships/jobs, Enhanced quality of relationships with future employers and colleagues, More long-term stability in careers, and Savings in time, money, and energy. The Self-Discovery Internship instills schools with competitive advantages that translate into: Resultant advancements in training of students and staff, Increased understanding of, and respect between staff and students, Improved daily engagement from students , Expanded insights and increased efficiency with academic advising and career planning, and Higher graduation rates (see what higher graduation rates will mean to your community by visiting www.all4ed.org. They impact: income, new jobs, spending, home sales, auto sales, local and state tax revenue. Here is the link to access specifics: http://impact.all4ed.org/#potential/income/united- states/all-students/) 3 Teacher Contribution According to Gallup research , the following tactics will help you r teachers better lead and support their students throughout the Self- Discovery Internship. 3.1 Trust Students are very gifted. The Gallup organizations research validates that the students talent simply \"needs to be uncovered rather than discovered ( StrengthsQuest , 2006, p. 241). \" The primary role of the teacher is to encourage students to complete the Self- Discovery Internship curriculum. However what is learned will mean much more to the student s, if they can TRUST that the teacher (and their parents/guardians) believes in them, and the bright future that awaits them as they discover more about their innate potential and Copyright 2014 HSCI, LLC Self-Discovery Internship Oct/2014 Page 7 of 8 how to apply it in their educational planning and career preparation . Listening and learning about their students talents, and how they can be applied to bring value to the world, will help teachers build a genuine and strong relationship with students at this critical point in their quest to form their own identity. 3.2 Hope As students contemplate their futures many educational/career possibilities will cross their minds. During the internship students will be pushed to narrow their focus as they consider further education and career opportunities. The teacher (and parents/guardians) have the power to extinguish the HOPE they are working so hard to put inside them, by simply criticizing a student's aspirations. The teachers (and parents/guardians) should not criticize, rather they should observe , and the internship process will help the students come to a responsible and valued conclusion regarding the contribution they can make to the world. People have been known to come from all walks of life to achieve great heights. There is no reason why these students cannot defy the odds and accomplish great things that they can be proud of as well. 3.3 Stability As students move on and act on the findings surrounding their talents they need to know they have their teachers (and parents/guardians) support no matter what . STABILITY is central to their confidence building . When they make a decision to apply for a job, an internship, or to a given institution of learning it is critical that teachers be willing to offer those who deserve it, letters of recommendation (leaving any personal bias out of the process). Doing so will empower students to learn to lead and manage their own lives around their own unique talents, and to do it with confidence. The Self-Discovery Internship will teach them about their talents and the process of securing opportunities for themselves. If teachers (and parents/guardians) want them to become responsible and valued citizens they need to learn to do the research, make decisions, and live with the consequences (positive or negative). That is tough for students to do if their teachers (and parents/guardians) are always making decisions for them, voicing their own opinions strongly without being asked, or vocally criticizing/judging their students decisions. 3.4 Compassion Students will run into challenging times regardless of the educational/career decisions they make. They need to maintain the confidence that their talents will direct them toward an opportunity that they will find to be rewarding and satisfying, both financially and emotionally. When things go great, teachers (and parents/guardians) need to be there for them to celebrate. When things get tou gh, they need to be there for them and support them through it by showing genuine COMPASSION . Students need to know that their teachers (and parents/guardians) support is unconditional and not tied to them getting accepted to prestigious universities, securing scholarships, winning awards, making a ton of money, or their possession of \"We know we can enhance hope in a way that makes that bump stable, so it's not just giving you a little hope bump and then two days later you're bummed out again. \" Shane Lopez, Research Director Clifton Strengths Institute / Senior scientist in residence at Gallup \"What universities traditi onally do is a mistake. Instead of developing for [students'] a sense of, what's your purpose in life and how are you going to achieve it, they just de velop this big knowledge base.... The reason you lose a lot of kids is they kind of give up hope on themselves...For me, the whole university is based around this notion that we're not just trying to teach kids a lot of facts and how to analyze those facts, but how to create meaningful lives.\" Robert J. Sternberg, Psychologist / P rovost / Senior Vice President at Oklahoma State LLC Self-Discovery Internship Oct/2014 Page 8 of 8 tangible items. The students future success and happiness in life should be the teachers (and parents/guardians) greatest accomplishment. Their talents are awaiting the privilege to shine. Teachers should pick their current, past, and future students up when they are down and get them back on track as fast as they can because with every day that goes by opportunities will be missed. 4 Conclusion High schools and cities cannot afford to think like how corporations and institutions of higher learning do when it comes to people. These organizations reject applicants with ease and send them off with no reason as to why they are being turned down. That, matched with the reality that almost any employee is disposable and can be terminated the minute their value to a company decreases, showcases the precise importance as to how critical this window of opportunity found by Tim Judge and Charlice Hurst during their 2008 study at the University of Florida, really is . During this window (the high school/college years) students must become more savvy when it comes to understanding their own unique value as individuals, their ability to sell their value to prospective employers, and their ability to make bette r educational and career selections to match their talents. If not, the trends of wasting precious time, limited resources, and valuable capit al will continue, leaving even greater economic and emotional burdens for the next generation to manage. As a superintendent or principal considering implementation of the Self-Discovery Internship for students/teachers, rest assured you now hold in your hands the ability to more powerfully impact their futures than ever before. You can honor them and their gifts most by helping students learn what they are made of, find where they fit in, and prepare them to make their unique contribution to the world; and as you do, you, your school(s), and your city will be rewarded as well.

Statement of Need The 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) indicated that one third of Idaho students had tried smoking before age 18 and that 12.2% of high school students smoked a cigarette one or more times in the past 30 days. YRBS data also indicates that an additional 5.6% of high school students used chewing tobacco, snuff or dip one or more times in the past 30 days. 1 This survey did not include youth no t in school, so actual use rate in this age group may be higher . If only 50% of these students become r egular tobacco users, they significantly increase their chances of developing cancer, heart problems or lung disease, and almost one third of them will die prematurely . A national study conducted by researchers at Ohio State University, indicates that smoker absenteeism, lost productivity, smoke breaks and health care, costs an employ er an average of $5,8 00 annually more , than of an employee who never s moked. 2 According to the Centers for Disease Control, $97,000,000 of Idaho Medicaid funds were used to cover the cost of smoking-related health services in 2004. 3 All of the these costs are preventable. A comprehensive tobacco program includes not only youth and parent education and cessation services, but also addresses youth access. The Idaho Prevention of Minor's Access to Tobacco statute (Title 39, Chapter 57) recognized that need and established a tobacco retailer permitting and compliance system to prevent youth access to tobacco products. Prior to the passage of this legislation, there was no statewide system to prevention youth access. This funding will ensure Idaho conducts a sufficient number of inspections to keep retailers focused on preventing tobacco sales to minors. It will also enable Idaho to comply with the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant requirements to ensure continued funding for substance use disorder prevention and treatment services. 1. 2013 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey A Health Look at Idaho Youth, Idaho Department of Education (http://www.sde.idaho.gov/site/csh/docs/YRBS%202013%20FINAL.pdf ) 2.

Armour, Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, \"State-Level Medicaid Expenditures Attributable to Smoking, http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2009/jul/08_0153.htm V. Project Design The goal of this project is to reduce youth access to tobacco products. The tobacco retailer violation rate wi ll be used to evaluate the goal. Each year a new generation of children experiment with tobacco use , tobacco inspections encourage retailers to remain alert to minors attempting to purchase tobacco products. Tobacco sellers and owners change over time, this provides an ongoing opportunity to deliver ed ucation and technical assistance to prevent youth access to tobacco products. All Idaho retailer tobacco permits expire on December 31st of each calendar year. The annual renewal of permits provides owners with the opportunity to update the ir business information and facilitates the identification of permittees who have changed ownership or closed during the year. This process reduces the cost of sending inspectors to closed businesses and ensures the correct owner is notified of inspection outcomes . The Idaho T obacco Project will conduct random unannounced permittee inspections based on the formula established in the Prevention of Minors' Access to Tobacco statute. The number of inspections Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 16 ISP MILLENNIUM FUND APPLICATION to be conducted will equal to the number of permittees multiplied by the violation rate of the previous calendar year violation rate multiplied by a factor of ten (10). Upon determination of the number of inspections to be conducted for the calendar year, an automated process will be used to establish the random order which inspections will occur and determine the gender of the minor who will conduct the inspection. This process will eliminate the potential for bias in the survey. Inspection teams will be c omposed of an adult inspector, an adult chaperone and a male and a female minor. The chaperone will ensure no minor is left unattended. Inspectors will be required to have law enforcement or military experience and participate in classroom and field training. Chaperones will receive a training as well. All adults will have to successfully complete a criminal history check prior to initiation of inspections. Minors will also participate in written and field training. When an inspector receives a list of permittees to be inspected , he/she establishes dates and times the team will conduct them . An adult inspector, only, will c onduct retail sales minor exempt permittees inspections. The inspection focuses on compliance with tobacco product placement, any minors in the establishment and vending machine use. All other inspections will be conducted by having the adult inspector enter the facility first and place him/herself in a position to view and overhear the minor's purchase attempt. The minor follows after a short period of time and ask to purchase the tobacco product. ( typically Marlboro or Camel the most popular youth brands) After the inspection, the minor leaves the building followed shortly by the adult. If a sale occurs, the product is immediately taken from the minor and tagged. The adult inspector completes the standard inspection forms and returns to the building to cite the clerk and the permittee. If no sale occurs, the adult inspector completes the inspection report and the team heads to the next site. The requested monies will cover the cost of eight hundred forty-eight ( 848) tobacco retailer compliance inspections. The chart below, depicts inspections to be conducted and months when the inspections will occur. The inspection numbers and months are highlighted.

Grant Management The Idaho Tobacco Project is a partnership between the Idaho State Police (ISP) and The Department of Health and Welfare (DHW). The ISP provides technical consult, inspection team safety and funding. DHW also provides funding as indicated in the budget notes. DHW also provides project staff, tobacco project websites, inspector and retailer education, and federal reports. This partnership has created an effective and efficient program to prevent minor's access to tobacco products. Lt. Colonel Kedrick Wills , Idaho State Police and Terry Pappin, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare share oversight of this project. The Idaho Tobacco Project is located within the Department of Health and Welfare in Boise. For this grant, the Idaho Tobacco Project will be responsible for the conduct of tobacco inspections and expenditure of grant funds. DHW will establish a contract agreement with an Idaho research firm to conduct inspections, train inspection teams, ensure inspections are conducted in compliance with Idaho protocols, ensure inspection reports are complete and certify permittee records are accurate. Tobacco Project staff are also responsible for retailer or clerk appeals using the Department of Health and Welfare's Administrative Hearing process. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 6 16 ISP MILLENNIUM FUND APPLICATION VII. Evaluation Plan This funding request will enable the Idaho Tobacco Project to conduct compliance inspections in all communities in Idaho. The tobacco retailer inspection data will be used to evaluate this project. Inspection teams will provide four types of data to Idaho Tobacco Project staff. They will verify the accuracy of retailer locations and ownership, document the conduct of the inspection including any anomalies in the inspection, document location, date, time and type of tobacco product purchased by the underage inspector and any other violation of the Prevention of Minors' Access to Tobacco statute. This data will be used to evaluate youth access to tobacco products statewide to determine the need for greater or lesser enforcement activities. The data will also be used to to evaluate the effectiveness of current retailer/clerk education resources and retailer technical assistance needs. This data will be used to revise current or develop new materials. Finally, the data will be used to identify retailer types more l ikely to sell tobacco products. This information will be used to develop targeted education and point of sale materials. This information will enable the Idaho Tobacco Project to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of the services delivered. Below is a chart depicting inspection outcomes for the past thirteen (13) years. Idaho Tobacco Retailer Compliance Rates VIII. Sustainability Idaho has been conducting statewide compliance inspections for fourteen ( 14) years. Continuing to support tobacco retailer inspections will ensure Idaho complies with the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant tobacco access requirements . Idaho's block grant award can be r educe up to 40% if the tobacco retailer violation rate is higher than 20%. Currently, an amount up to $3,390.1 69. These funds cover 100% of the state's community-based substance abuse prevention services and provide a significant portion of the Department of Health 's Welfare's substance use disorders treatment services budget. Under the Prevention of Minors' Access to Tobacco statute, permits are issued at no cost to the retailer. In addition, the current low violation rate has resulted in a significant drop in tobacco fine receipts. Thus, the Tobacco Project receipts are insufficient to sustain the progr am. In order to meet the statute requirements, the Tobacco Project has used Millennium grant f unds as well as general and substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant funds to support the cost of tobacco compliance inspections. Idaho Tobacco Project staff continue to search for funding sources to cover all the tasks included in the system. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 6 16 ISP MILLENNIUM FUND APPLICATION IX. Evidence-Based Research 1. Diemert, Dubray, Babayan and Schwartz of the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit state that programs which prevent tobacco sales to minors have been proven to reduce youth smoking rates. They indicate that legislation preventing sales to minors is necessary but insufficient to reduce sales. What is needed is a comprehensive program which includes enforcement was well as effective retailer education and community involvement. (Strategies Affecting Tobacco Vendor Compliance with Youth Access Laws, October 2013, http://otru.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/special_vendor_compliance.pdf ) 2.

This report requires Idaho to provide statistically valid data on retailer compliance rates. In 1997, the first year of the survey, Idaho's compliance rate was 43.8%. The rate reported in Idaho's 2014 Synar report is 93.1%. Curt Braun, PhD, supervises the conduct of the survey and conducted the statistical analyses required for this report. The current report may be found on the internet at http://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/Portals/0/Medical/SUD/FFY2014AnnualSynarReport.pdf . (Braun, Idaho Synar Report 42 U.S.C. 300x-42 OMB No 0930-0222 FFY 2014 State: Idaho) 3. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Services reported to Congress that research indicates that r etailer compliance checks and penalties for retailers who sell to minors led to significant reductions in sales to minors.

This was accomplished by conducting random tobacco retailer compliance inspections. Rationale or Justification for Project : Research has proven that programs which prevent tobacco sales to minors reduce youth smoking rates. The requirement to conduct of tobacco retailer compliance inspections is established in the Idaho Prevention of Minors' Access to Tobacco statute. (Title 39, Chapter 57) The request for Millennium Funds was made to ensure compliance with the aforementioned statute. The funds were also needed to meet a requirement established in the Synar Amendment to the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant code. States failing to have a law preventing minors' access to tobacco and reasonably enforce the law are subject to a reduction of the grant up to 40%. These funds ensured compliance with state and federal laws. Project Summary : The millennium funds were used to cover the cost of 848 retailer compliance i nspections. Two types of inspections were conducted. Minor exempt inspections were conducted at retailers whose revenue from the sale of alcohol for onsite consumption equaled at least 55% of their income or at businesses whose services were primarily X-rated.. For all other retailers, the minor inspector attempted to purchase tobacco product from the retailer as a part of the inspection. The Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 2 ISP 14 REPORT Millennium funded inspections comprised 38% of the total number of inspections conducted in FY 2014. (Total was 2500) Geographic Area Covered : The tobacco retailer inspections covered the state of Idaho. P roject Outputs : The funding covered the cost of 848 tobacco retailer compliance inspections P roject Outcomes : The outcome of the inspections was a retailer compliance rate of 91 .5%. This rate enabled the Idaho Tobacco Project to meet the goal established in the 2014 application.

Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 6 FY16 IDJC MILLENNIUM GRANT APPLICATION IV. Statement of Need In 2013, over 65% of youth booked into juvenile detention facilities who were screened by clinicians had a mental health problem, substance abuse problem, or both. Furthermore, 73% of these youth had been diagnosed with a mental health or substance abuse problem before coming to the detention facility.1 Similar results were observed in four previous years of the Detention Clinician Program administered by IDJC. These data reveal that substance abuse and mental health issues affecting youth are known before their behavior leads to confinement in a detention facility. Many youth experience both conditions simultaneously, often referred to as co-occurring disorders. Research indicates individuals with attention an d emotional problems continue to smoke at high rates while overall usage declines.2 The phenomenon of self-medication may explain the prevalence of youth entering the juvenile justice system with co- occurring mental health and substance abuse issues. The continuum of care for juveniles in regard to tobacco use and substance abuse starts with prevention programs and strategies that serve youth in the community at large such as those administered through the Office of Drug Policy. Juveniles that come to the attention of the juvenile justice system require individualized responses. Juveniles who demonstrate a need for outpatient or residential treatme nt program can access this level of care through the substance use disorder (SUD) funding administered by IDJC. This proposal targets those youth who have come to the attention of the juvenile justice system due to some type of offense but whose assessment scores do not warrant treatment through the IDJC SUD program. Judges and practitioners in Idaho report a critical gap in services for low level offenders who have used substances or are at risk of substance abuse. There were 228 juvenile status offenders ordered to juvenile detention facilities because of violations of valid court orders. Another 23 juvenile status offenders were held in detention over 24 hours before appropriate placements could be made. Addressing the issues of youth committing status offenses, or other low level offenses, through the use of secure confinement can often lead to negative outcomes and further involvement in the juvenile justice system.3 The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (JJDP Act) includes a protection f or youth committing status offenses to restrict secure confinement based on the notion that these youth are not \"criminal thinkers\" but are affected by complex familial, health, and community dynamics. Furthermore, inappropriate treatment of low risk juvenile offenders can lead to traumatic or adverse experiences for those youth. The Center for Disease Control studies on Adverse Childhood Experiences exposed clear links between adverse experiences and substance abuse.4 The same was noted for smoking.5 Youth entering the juvenile justice system who have committed tobacco violations, substance abuse, or status offenses require specialized treatment to help them develop into responsible citizens. Early intervention through accurate assessment and effective programming are core principles of this application. 1 McDonald, T. W., Begic, S., Gazieva, K & Lindsay, S. (2014).

Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 6 FY16 IDJC MILLENNIUM GRANT APPLICATION V. Project Design The Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections (IDJC) intends to continue the FY15 project to encourage communities, when appropriate, to intervene when a youthful offender engages in tobacco use or substance abuse. The strategy is to focus on early intervention with low-level offender s including status offenders and first time substance use offender s. IDJC will continue to fund community-based programs throughout the state . IDJC re- awarded 14 programs previously overseen by the Courts and newly-awarded 12 Restorative Justice Practices programs in FY15 . As indicated in the FY15 application, IDJC intends to fund these programs over a five y ear period based on continued funding and program outcomes. Current programs provide a range of services such as restorative justice conferencing, family-group decision making, tobacco and alcohol diversion services aimed at cessation and prevention (e.g., Not on Tobacco, Thinking for a Change, Towards No Drugs), youth courts, and various types of status offender services. New projects will be solicited on a competitive basis for community-based approaches to continue filling gaps in services for juvenile offenders. The Idaho Juvenile Justice Commission will oversee the sub- granti ng process. Programs follow best practice principles including: diversion from court, use of validated assessment tools, immediate responses, effective services, family engagement, and internal assessment. IDJC provides ongoing technical assistance to each program to support continuous improvement and help program managers network and share effective practices. IDJC will continue to empower the Idaho Juvenile Justice Commission and eight local Juvenile Justice Councils to serve as the planning and oversight bodies for grant activities. Each Council drafts an Action Plan that is used by the Commission to develop a statewide Juvenile Justice Plan. This structure allows IDJC to identify and meet local needs to effectively address tobacco and substance use by juvenile offenders while keeping them at home in the community. Goal 1: Prevent and reduce tobacco and substance use by juvenile status offenders and low-risk de linquent offenders . OBJECTIVES: 1. Support evidence-based restorative justice projects focused on status offenders. 2. Achieve a 90% program completion rate for youth served. 3. Document a reduction in risk for tobacco and/or substance use for juveniles served. Goal 2: Enhance collaboration within the juvenile justice system to address status offenses. O BJECTIVES: 1. Establish District and Tribal Councils as the oversight bodies for status offender services. 2. Support judicial leadership by allocating funds specifically for court programs. 3. Encourage membership on Councils by Trial Court Administrators and Magistrate Judges. 4. Develop and implement District and Tribal Juvenile Justice Council Action Plans. 5. Support the Idaho Juvenile Justice Commission to develop and oversee a state juvenile justice plan based on common themes of Council Action Plans. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 6 FY16 IDJC MILLENNIUM GRANT APPLICATION VI. Grant Management The Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections will administer this program through its Grants Bureau. Other grants managed by IDJC include programs of the Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) such as: Title II State Formula Grant and the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant. The Idaho Juvenile Justice Commission will provide planning and oversight for grant activities. The Commission serves as the State Advisory Board for OJJDP grant programs and has over 20 years of history managing state plans and grant funds. The Commission and Department work in partnership to provide resources to local communities. IDJC employs a structured process for solicitation, review, award, management, and evaluation of grant funded projects. The Grants Bureau supports sub-grantee organizations and collects financial and performance data quarterly. The Fiscal Bureau provides oversight of financial expenditures and ensures segregation of duties. IDJC has experienced no findings in annual audits for several years and strives to maintain absolute integrity with funds entrusted to it. VII. Evaluation Plan IDJC will continue to contract with the Boise State University Center for Health Policy to foster a robust evaluation of all activities and programs in this project. The FY15 evaluation is focused on process- evaluation which will allow the evaluation team to turn its attention to outcome-focused evaluation in FY16 and beyond. The evaluation team plans to use logic models developed during the FY15 cycle to inform the specific outcomes by which each program's performance will be measured. Primary goals for all programs are to reduce risk for new or continued use of tobacco and other substances by juvenile offenders and to prevent or limit involvement in the formal juvenile justice system for youth committing tobacco, substance use, and other status offenses . The evaluation team expects to be able to answer: ( 1) whether the funded programs are evidence-based and implemented with fidelity; and (2) to what extent these strategies lead to changes in knowledge and attitudes about tobacco and substance use, decreased recidivism among youth served, decreased referrals to the juvenile justice system, and decreased formal petitions. The assessment methods and strategies involve screening every youth served for tobacco and substance use issues, implementing a consistent data collection and analysis strategy, key informant interviews, on- site observations and visits and other activities designed to answer the evaluation questions. Data gathered through these means will be shared with funded programs to facilitate continuous quality improvement and increase model fidelity and use of best practices. Stakeholder involvement will continue to be heavily emphasized. This emphasis is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that the evaluation team intends to tailor the evaluation to each individual program because the methods used by each program vary somewhat depending on their local needs and goals . Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 6 FY16 IDJC MILLENNIUM GRANT APPLICATION VIII. Sustainability IDJC approaches sustainability on two primary levels: supporting evidence-based programs and encouragi ng local support. First, using methods and techniques proven to be effective allow sub- grantees to focus on implementation and model fidelity with the expectation that desired results will be realized. Second, programs must be supported locally to be sustained. Thus, IDJC will assist program managers with identifying, collecting, and reporting relevant data to stakeholders. IDJC will also work wi th each program to identify potential funding sources to build a comprehensive sustainability plan , complete with timelines and benchmarks. IX. Evidence-Based Research IDJC's methodology is to intervene with juvenile offenders at the earliest point possible in the least restrictive means and provide effective services in a cost effective manner. IDJC pursues this methodology by employing principles for best practices in juvenile justice including risk assessment, needs assessment, and case planning. The article referenced below describes the principles and evidence to support IDJC's approach: http://cjjr.georgetown.edu/pdfs/ebp/ebppaper.pdf . In order to address the needs of juvenile offenders at the earliest point possible, IDJC supports local community-based agencies and organizations to implement programs. Because the problems and needs within communities vary, the specific programs needed also vary. The evidence to support individual programs funded through IDJC's Millennium Grant may be found in multiple websites including federally sponsored registries such as: SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/Search.aspx . This site includes programs currently implemented by agencies receiving Millennium Grant funds from IDJC: Active Parenting of Teens (Volunteers of America) Life Skills Training (Ada County, Learning Life Inc.) Not on Tobacco (Madison County, 5th Judicial District) Project Towards No Drug Abuse (5th Judicial District) Project Alert (Boise County) Utilization of restorative programs such as Restorative Conferencing and incorporation of Restorative Practices in other programs addressing substance abuse are discussed in the following article: Bringing Restorative Justice to Adolescent Substance Abuse, Youth and Society http://www.sagepub.com/upm- data/2997_12ys01.pdf A more detailed listing of websites with outcome evaluation data for programs funded through IDJC's Millennium Grant is included as Appendix A to this application.

According to a report commissioned by tobacco company Brown and Williamson, \"The use of marijuana...has important implica t ions for the tobacco industry in terms of an alternative product line. [We] have the land to grow it, the machines to roll it and package it, the distribution to market it.\" Further troubling news comes from the Philip Morris parent company, Altria, which has purchased the following Web dom ain names: \"AltriaCannabis.com\" and \"AltriaMarijuana.com.\" This is just a hint of what is to come as states legalize marijuana; a drug that time and again has been proven through valid scientific research to cause significant physical, mental, and social harms. The pro marijuana lobby has spent millions of dollars to persuade individu als that use of this drug is no big deal, and there has been virtually no messaging countering these claims. Without balanced information about the increasing dangers of marijuana, increasing numbers of Idaho youth report that they do not see marijuana use as wrong or risky. This is to be expecte d , as prevention science has demonstrated that as social norms change and people begin perceiving the risk of drug use as low, their use of drugs will increase. This increased drug use is a clear danger to public health and safety. In response, the Office of Drug Policy is requesting f unding from the Joint Millennium Fund to develop and implement a statewide multimedia campaign to inform Idahoans regarding the dangers of marijuana use. For more information about this funding request or issues related to marijuana, please contact the Office of Drug Policy at (208)8543040.

Up in Smoke: The Truth About Marijuana Joint Millennium Fund Committee Elisha Figueroa, Administrator Idaho Office of Drug Policy December 12, 2014 Current State of Affairs As of November 4, 2014, Alaska , Colorado , Washington , Oregon , and Washington D.C. have legalized recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. Big Marijuana: The New Big Tobacco Since 1970, tobacco companies such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company have been researching opportunities to expand their companies to include marijuana sales.2 The tobacco industry's experience uniquely positions it to enter the market where it stands to gain financially for increasing the use of the drug.2 Marley Natural, the \"world's first global brand of marijuana launched [in November 2014] with the support of $50 million dollars in private equity and the same marketing machine that took Starbucks to the masses\".9 Follow the Money From 1970 - early 2014 , $80 million was spent by special interest groups to legalize medical and recreational marijuana at the state-level.25 2014 spending on legalization in Alaska, Oregon, and D.C.24 Marijuana Proponents- AK, OR, DC Marijuana Opponents- AK, OR, DC$400,000 \u00ac $9,000,000 Message Manipulation Messaging & Policy Impacts Research has shown that the perception of risk for marijuana use is predictive of whether people will use marijuana.11,13,18 0.001.002.003.004.005.006.007.008.00 2002-2003 2010-2011Percentage of Individuals Reporting Past Month Marijuana Usage 27 National Idaho 01020304050 2002-2003 2010-2011Percentage of Individuals Who Believe Smoking Marijuana Once a Month Poses a Great Risk 27 National IdahoMessaging & Policy Impacts 38.06 2010-2011Idaho Trends in Risk Perception and Usage 27 Risk of Smoking Marijuana Past Year Usage Past Month UsageRisks to Public Health & Safety Marijuana use has been associated with an increased risk for developing depressive disorders .17 Marijuana use is a risk factor for development of psychosis .1,29 Risks to Public Health & Safety Marijuana is the most prevalent illegal drug detected in impaired drivers, fatally injured drivers, and motor crash victims.22 From 1999-2010, marijuana prevalence nearly tripled in fatally injured drivers.6 Smoking marijuana results in 5X carbon monoxide concentration, 3X the tar , and the retention of one-third more tar in the respiratory tract than tobacco smoke.4,20,28,30 Unintended Consequences Up in Smoke: Project Design Statewide exposure to comprehensive media campaign.

Idaho Code Section 67-821 governs ODP whose mission is to lead Idaho's substance abuse policy and prevention efforts by developing and implementing strategic action plans and collaborative partnerships to reduce drug use and related crime, thereby improving the health and safety of all Idahoans. ODP is administered by Elisha Figueroa and includes five additional staff members and a federal prevention fellow. ODP is committed to partnering with local communities and additional public and private stakeholders in improving the effectiveness and accessibility of prevention services across all 44 of Idaho's counties. ODP collaborates with the Department of Health and Welfare and the Department of Juvenile Corrections on the Be The Parents underage drinking prevention campaign, coordinates the Lock Your Meds Idaho campaign to educate Idahoans on the risks of prescription drug abuse, works closely with community coalitions throughout the state, and is building strong partnerships with Idaho law enforcement agencies. In addition, ODP continues to work with its partners to reduce substance abuse through policy change. II. Grant Proposal Summary Meets One or More of the Following Criteria : (Indicate Yes Where Applicable) 1. Tobacco Cessation or Prevention 2. Substance Abuse Cessation or Prevention YES 3. Tobacco or Substance Abuse Treatment Purpose of Grant : The Office of Drug Policy (ODP) is applying for Millennium funds to implement a statewide educational campaign designed to inform Idahoans regarding the facts about marijuana. ODP Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 8 and members of its Marijuana Workgroup have attempted to identify high quality, education al marijuana campai gns; however, none fit Idaho's needs. As a result, Idaho will need to develop a media message that both resonates with and informs Idahoans on this important issue. In addition to campaign development, grant funds will be used to purchase airtime for public service announcements, social media, printing, shipping, and space for billboards and bus advertisements . Costs as sociated with hiring an outside, professional evaluator are also included in this request; thus, allowing ODP to evaluate the effectiveness of this campaign in changing Idahoans' knowledge and perception s regarding marijuana. If awarded, it is ODP's intention to partner with other like-minded states interested in delivering a similar message. This may allow us to share the campaign development costs and could result in the message reaching a broad er audience. Grant Amount Requested : $995,000 III.

Statement of Need Big Marijuana as the New Big Tobacco As marijuana legalization has been passed in Washington and Colorado, it is important to understand the parallels between tobacco and marijuana companies. Tobacco companies such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company have been making plans to expand their companies to incorporate marijuana sales since the 1970's1. An easy transition can be made between tobacco and marijuana sales, and the tobacco industry has loyal consumers and the funds to develop a marijuana monopoly. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 8 As states face the possibility of legalizing medical marijuana, it is appropriate to remember that in the 1950's tobacco companies attempted to enter the pharmaceutical industry, stating that tobacco helped relieve psychiatric symptoms1. Lack of Educational Resources As of October 1, 2014, there are 23 medical marijuana states, 2 states that have legalized recreational marijuana, and voters in Washington DC, Alaska, and Oregon will decide this fall whether or not to legalize recreational marijuana. The well-funded, strategically organized, pro-marijuana movement in the United States has successfully convinced many that there are no negative impacts to marijuana use. Estimates show that from 1970-2013, as money was invested into the pro-marijuana movement, legalization support increased over 100%28. In an effort to legalize medical as well as recreational marijuana at the state-level, $80 million has been spent by special interest groups to craft messaging that equates marijuana to a consequence-free indulgence28. According to Gil Kerlikowske, former director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), almost no federal funding has gone to counter the pro-marijuana campaigns21. ODP recognizes the necessity of providing factual, scientific evidence to inform Idaho citizens about marijuana to counter the pro-drug messaging currently saturating the media. Risks to Public Health and Safety As a result of the pro-marijuana lobby, many Americans and Idahoans are becoming convinced that marijuana is harmless. However, the implications are very serious. Marijuana is now the most prevalent illegal drug detected in impaired drivers, fatally injured drivers, and motor crash victims24 Smoking marijuana results in approximately 5 times the carbon monoxide concentration, 3 times the tar, and the retention of one-third more tar in the respiratory tract than tobacco smoke 3,22,30,31 Marijuana use is linked to depression, schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts, and paranoia20 Marijuana has been shown to significantly impact brain structure. People who smoke marijuana recreationally, meaning fewer than once a week, develop differences in the shape of brain structures responsible for learning, reward, fear, addiction, decision-making, and emotional reactions13 Marijuana use has been linked to testicular cancer17 The THC concentrations in seized marijuana have almost doubled from 1999 to 20097 Usage Researchers have shown that the perception of risk for marijuana use is predictive of whether people will use marijuana12,15,19, and Idaho data gives cause for concern. More than 1 in 5 Idaho high school seniors believe that smoking marijuana once or twice a week poses no risk at all9 22% of Idaho high school seniors believe that it is not at all wrong for someone their age to smoke marijuana9 In Idaho, on average, 30% of all high school students have tried marijuana at least once in their lives8 and just over 15% of the same population has used marijuana at least once in the past 30 days8 Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the United States13,18,25. Additionally, marijuana legalization increases marijuana use in the state's legal population, youth, and among residents of other states. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 8 Average past month use among youth aged 12-17 has increased by 25% after marijuana legalization27 Although marijuana usage among youth has increased nationwide (from 6.75% in 2006 to 7.55% in 2012), the gap between usage in Colorado compared to the Nation is rapidly increasing, with it being 2.92% in 201227 Media Campaign Effectiveness Media campaigns have been shown to effectively and positively change attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors 4-6,12,14,16,29,21,23,26. However, all media campaigns are not created equal. Campaigns that are educational an d that capitalize on society's ability to choose their own behaviors are much more successful. The truth\u00ae campaign, an educational campaign to reduce tobacco use among Americans, significantly increased anti-smoking attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors for 12-17 year olds. Americans aged 18-24 were also positively influenced by the truth\u00ae campaign26. In fact, the truth\u00ae campaign was responsible for a 22% nationwide decrease in youth smoking in a matter of 3 years10. In addition to the truth\u00ae campaign being highly effective in improving anti-tobacco related behaviors, it was determined to be a major cost saving effort; the money invested in the truth\u00ae campaign yielded more than 5.8 times the invested amount in savings in three years14. Quality of life and ability to contribute to society are invaluable benefits of such a campaign that cannot be associated with a dollar amount, but surely added to the value of the campaign. Although there are a limited number of anti-marijuana media campaigns, and therefore limited research, anti-marijuana media campaigns have been shown to positively influence attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Researchers have found that adult exposure to anti-marijuana messages increased perceived risk of marijuana use and decreased the intention to use marijuana and actual marijuana usage2. Additionally, another group of researchers found that increased anti-marijuana media messages significantly increased the frequency of parent-child marijuana related conversations16. Parent-child communication can lead to a change in the child's attitudes and intentions to use marijuana16. V. Project Design Up in Smoke: The Truth About Marijuana will be a multi-media campaign designed to reduce marijuana use by educating Idahoans about the dangers associated with marijuana use and legalization. ODP will develop a campaign message based on empowerment messaging, Social Norms Theory, and the Social Ecological Model, which are all evidence-based processes. The message will be personally relevant to Idahoans, will provide marijuana use prevalence information, educate Idahoans regarding the true costs of marijuana use, and increase awareness about the realities of marijuana legalization. Media will be distributed throughout Idaho with ODP adopting innovative methods to ensure the message reaches rural, frontier, and tribal communities. ODP will also ensure that materials are produced in Spanish for Idaho's Latino population. The campaign will consist of billboards, bus advertisements, TV and radio PSA's, print materials, and social media outreach, all presenting a cohesive message throughout the state. Project Goal : Protect public health and safety by preventing an increase in marijuana use in Idaho. With this goal in mind, pre and post-surveys will be used to collect data from Idaho citizens in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the project in meeting the following stated objectives: 1) Increase the perception of risk associated with marijuana use 2) Increase knowledge regarding the dangers of marijuana use 3) Increase knowledge about the consequences of marijuana legalization. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 8 Timeline: VI. Grant Management Idaho Code 67-821 places responsibility with the Office of Drug Policy to \"coordinate public and private entities to develop, create and promote statewide campaigns to reduce or eliminate substance abuse.\" ODP is well equipped to do this and will perform all duties associated with the grant management process including oversight of all contracts, campaign development, and media buys. ODP has demonstrated its ability to establish and monitor these contracts and processes through past campaigns such as the Lock Your Meds Idaho prescription drug campaign and the Be The Parents underage drinking campaign. ODP staff members are highly skilled at managing grant funds. Currently, ODP administers the prevention portion of Idaho's Substance Abuse Block Grant as well as the Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In addition, ODP is adept at bringing stakeholders and other private and public partners together to implement change. This is evident by the ongoing work of ODP's Strategic State Prevention Planning Committee which has prioritized Idaho's substance abuse issues as : Underage drinking, marijuana use, an d prescription drug abuse. Members of the committee and its associated workgroups consist of stakeholders from throughout the state collaborating to prevent substance abuse. These members are in support of the requested campaign and are excited to assist in its implementation, which will contribute to ODP's ability to successfully launch and complete this project. VII. Evaluation Plan The overall goal of this educational campaign is to protect the public 's health and safety by preventing an increase in marijuana use in Idaho, as well as the associated negative health and public safety outcomes. ODP will work with a professional evaluator to develop an evaluation plan to gather data and measure outcomes. During the development of the project, stakeholders will be invited to participate in focus groups to identify a message that clearly resonates with adult Idahoans. Stakeholders will also have the opportunity to provide feedback about the campaign via survey methods. ODP will use this data to inform Resources Millennium Fund dollars Office of Drug Policy (ODP) Staff ODP Marijuana Workgroup Support from stakeholders Comparable goals to other states regarding marijuana Familiarity with the RFP process Organizational interest in public health Activities Develop partnerships with like -minded states RFP and hire a creative and innovative marketing firm to meet our needs Aid in the development of an anti-marijuana multimedia campaign RFP and hire a qualified evaluator to meet our needs Deliver the campaign Disseminate evaluation findings Outputs Well -designed multimedia campaign Shared development costs for a large campaign Partnerships with other states Evaluation report Campaign survey Template for others to follow for marijuana related media campaigns Short -Term Outcomes Provide factual use prevalance information Educate Idahoans regarding the costs of marijuana use Develop a campaign message that is personally relevant to Idahoans Increase awareness about the realities of marijuana legalization Medium -Term Outcomes Increase the perception of risk associated with marijuana use Increase knowledge regarding the dangers of marijuana use Increase knowledge about the consequences of marijuana legislation Long -Term Outcome Prevent increase in marijuana use for Media Firm & Evaluator Awarded Campaign Development/Focus Groups/Baseline Survey Media Development Campaign Launch Post Campaign Survey and RecommendationsPreparation Preimplementation Implementation Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 8 delivery and messaging of the campaign. The final evaluation of the campaign will determine if the following outcomes were produced: 1) Did the campaign increase the perception of risk associated with marijuana use? 2) Did the campaign increase knowledge regarding the dangers of marijuana use? 3) Did the campaign increase knowledge about the consequences of marijuana legalization? These questions will be measured by conducting a baseline survey prior to the launch of the campaign and a post survey upon completion of the campaign to measure the difference in Idahoans' knowledge and perception as a result of the project. Additionally, ODP will triangulate the data with the Idaho Youth Prevention Survey and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey regarding similar self-reported variables such as risk perception and marijuana use behaviors. VIII. Sustainability ODP expects that the evaluation results from the campaign will demonstrate that it had a positive effect on Idahoans' knowledge and perception of risk regarding marijuana. At that point, ODP will seek funding to continue this campaign through grant opportunities focused on decreasing marijuana use including federal grant programs through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the SAMHSA. Other funding options ODP may pursue include partnering with local community coalitions to set aside part of their budgets to continue addressing marijuana use. However, if evaluation results do not demonstrate the anticipated positive results, the campaign will either be discontinued or altered extensively in order to achieve the desired results. IX.

R., Wunderink, K. A., Vallone, D. M. & Healton, C. G. Publication Date: 2009 Using methods in accordance with the U.S. Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health Medicine, researchers found that a national anti-smoking media campaign saved $1.9 billion in three years in medical costs averted with an initial investment of $324 million dollars which included development, implementation, evaluation, and litigation costs. For every dollar spent on the campaign, the nation saved $5.86.

Publication Date: 2012 In this study, researchers found that adults' increased exposure to anti-marijuana media campaigns has a significant, positive, unidirectional, direct association with an increase in perceived societal risk of marijuana use and perceived personal risk of marijuana use as well as a significant, negative, unidirectional, direct association with marijuana use in the last year. Additionally, increased exposure to anti-marijuana media campaigns has a significant, negative, unidirectional, indirect association with intention to use marijuana and attitudes toward marijuana use.

Publication Date: 2014 Researchers found that parental exposure t o anti-marijuana ads was associated with a decrease in youth intention to use marijuana within one year. The reason for the decrease in youth marijuana use intention can be attributed to the ads affecting parents' initiation of drug communication with their teen and changes in parental normative beliefs regarding marijuana.

The Association of Idaho Cities has had the good fortune of partnering with the Office of Drug Policy on substance abuse issues vital to the health and safety of Idahoans, specifically the harms of marijuana. Their work is stellar and their approach to drug issues is innovative. The Offi ce of Drug Policy's request focuses on the development and implementation of an educational campaign regarding the harms of marijuana. As neighboring states choose to legalize this drug, it is vital that citizens in Idaho be fully informed about the dangers of marijuana use. The Office of Drug Policy will provide Idaho communities with the necessary data and research to empower them in making decisions that will ensure their public health and safety. With neighboring states succumbing to the influence of the pro-marijuana lobby and saturating media with pro- drug messages, I am excited about the Office's plans to provide Idahoans with counter messaging to allow Idahoans to make well informed decisions. Idaho needs more attention brought to this issue and the Office of Drug Policy has demonstrated their ability to educate the public regarding drug issues.

In 2010, seven million individuals age 12 or older were current nonmedical users of prescription drugs and Idaho has experienced a 250% increase in drug induced deaths since 2000 (Idaho Vital Statistics, 2010). Idaho treatment centers have witnessed a seven fold increase in admissions for opioid abuse in the last ten years (Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, 2011) and over 20% of Idaho high school students reported taking a prescription drug without a doctor's prescription. These youth overwhelmingly reported that they obtained these drugs from family members or friends. In response, the Office of Drug Policy launched a statewide media campaign to educate Idahoans about the dangers of prescription abuse. Project Summary : Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 3 MILLENNIUMFUND_REPORTFY14 \"Lock Your Meds\" (LYM) was a multi-media campaign designed to reduce prescription drug abuse by making adults aware that they are the \"unwitting suppliers\" of prescription medications being used in unintended ways, especially by young people. The campaign launched in October 2013 during National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month, and ran through June 2014. Media methods consist ed of a mix of television, radio, digital, bus, billboards, and print campaign materials, all presenting a cohesive communication throughout the state. The simple message was \"Be aware. Don't share.\" Geographic Area Covered : T he level of funding provided by the Legislature was enough to support a statewide multimedia campaign designed to reach all regions of Idaho. Project Outputs : Well designed, Idaho specific, statewide multimedia campaign including: Television ads Radio ads Digital ads Bus ads Billboards Print ads Independent campaign evaluation report by G2 Strategies Ongoing campaign presence via Facebook, Twitter, and www.lockyourmedsidaho.org Project Outcomes : The Office of Drug Policy awarded a contract to CLM Marketing and Advertising to deliver the statewide campaign and G2 Public Strategies was hired to evaluate the effectiveness of the LYM campaign. A baseline survey was conducted in October 2013 prior to the launch of the campaign and a post-campaign survey was conducted in April 2014 with N=400 Idahoans, age 35+ and a margin of error +/- 4.9%. Evaluation results showed: Overall 6 6.3% of Idahoans said they had heard the message Of these, 80% saw television ads, 15% hear d radio ads, and 15% s aw billboard ads 16% of people reported they would change their storage habits as a result of the campaign (statistically significant) When in possession of leftover medications: 30% of Idahoans keep it , 20% dispose of it at a disposal site , 17% throw it in the trash, 13% flush it Parents of teenagers showed a statistically significant increase in concern that their teen may access their medications Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 3 MILLENNIUMFUND_REPORTFY14 Financial Statement: Description Amount Total Revenue Millennium Fund Grant $627,602 Other Fund Sources $0 In-Kind Match $283,230 Total Revenue $910,832 Expenses Personnel $0 Transfer $900,108 Dollar Variance $10,724 Percent Variance 1.2% Budget Notes : The remaining $10,724 was reverted back to the State of Idaho.

Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 3 of 7 PROJECT FILTER MF APPLICATION FINAL IV. Statement of Need The Cost Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disability, disease, and death in the United States, unnecessarily straining health systems and imposing enormous financial costs.1 Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke are responsible for 4 80,000 deaths - one of every five deaths - each year in the United States.1 Though two-thirds of current Idaho smokers have attempted to quit, an estimated 1,8 00 Idahoans will die each year from smoking-related diseases.2,3 One out of eight (12.2%) of Idaho high school students smoke cigarettes, or approximately 11,100 students statewid e.4 If current patterns of smoking behavior persist, an estimated 30,200 Idaho youth are projected to die prematurely from smoking. 3 The economic burden of cigarette use in Idaho remains substantial. Productivity losses due to smoking are estimated at $358 million annually, while smoking-attributable healthcare costs in Idaho are estimated at $508 million annually.3,5 Idaho's Medicaid program covers $83 million in smoking-related healthcare costs.5 Despite the significant health and economic burden of tobacco use, Idaho's 2012 adult smoking rate (16.4%) remains below the national median of 19.6%.6 As the sole comprehensive, statewide tobacco prevention and control program, Project Filter is uniquely positioned to combat tobacco use. Tobacco prevention and control programs that receive consistent funding have been proven to reduce smoking and healthcare costs related to tobacco use.1, 3 Rationale The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recognizes smoking cessation services as one of the top services for both preventing health consequences of cigarette use and for cost effectiveness.7 Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) medications are a way to deliver nicotine into the bloodstream to stop or reduce the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal while a person tries to quit smoking or using smokeless tobacco. NRT, combined with behavioral support screening and counseling, can increase the likelihood of a person successfully quitting smoking by 70 to 100 percent when compared with just behavioral counseling alone.7 Project Filter offers both NRT and behavioral support through the Idaho Quitline and online cessation resources. The effectiveness of quitlines offering proactive telephone counseling and NRT is well established.1,3,7 Individual-based resources, while effective, are not intended to address the social consequences of tobacco use. Tobacco companies spend over $118,000 a day to market tobacco products to Idaho citizens.5 This effort, to establish brand identity and normalize tobacco use, has been ongoing for decades. Counter-marketing is an effective method to counter pro-tobacco influences through the use of commercial marketing tactics.1,3 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Best Practices, counter-marketing activities play a critical role in increasing smoking cessation and decreasing youth initiation of tobacco products in Idaho.3 Project Filter regularly contracts with independent evaluators to assess the effectiveness of its counter-marketing efforts. An evaluation conducted in 2014 found:8 92% of Idaho adults think it's a good idea for Project Filter to use TV, newspaper and radio ads to remind people about the dangers of tobacco. 90% of Idaho adults think it's a good idea for Project Filter to offer internet and telephone services such as Idaho's QuitLine, to help smokers who are trying to quit using tobacco. Best Practices Evaluations performed on other states' counter-marketing programs have concluded that well-funded, consistent, and frequent messaging works to decrease tobacco use. CDC has provided guidance and recommendations for counter-marketing programs conducted by state public health agencies.3,9 Counter- marketing programs must be: Long term and evaluated routinely. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 7 PROJECT FILTER MF APPLICATION FINAL Integrated, multi-component programs that use a variety of available techniques and components at different times and in different combinations. Integrated into the larger tobacco control program along with educational efforts, cessation initiatives, and enforcement and policy campaigns. Culturally competent; it must address every segment of the program's priority populations. Adequately funded because tobacco advertising and promotion activities appear to both stimulate adult tobacco consumption and increase risk of youth initiation of tobacco use. V. Project Design Description of Project Counter-marketing: The Department of Health and Human Services defines counter-marketing as a s trategy that attempts to counter pro-tobacco influences and increase pro-health messages and influences throughout a state, region, or community. Project Filter uses a targeted, segmented-audience approach to address tobacco prevention in populations that have the highest rates of tobacco use in Idaho. Project Filter collaborates and contracts with internal program partners, local public health districts and local community members and organizations to expand its reach and reinforce its marketing campaigns. Project Filter's counter-marketing program consists of earned and paid media, including TV, radio, print, social media, grassroots marketing, and other activities such as sponsorships and community outreach. Cessation Services: Project Filter continues to offer a free telephonic and web-based cessation service to Idaho residents wishing to quit tobacco use. Project Filter contracts with a nationally recognized cessation service vendor that provides up to five free counseling sessions with a trained cessation coach, printed and online self-guided materials, and free NRT upon request. The cessation service incorporates evidence-based recommendations in a participatory model of care that enables individuals to develop the skills and confidence to quit tobacco use and remain tobacco free. The program is tailored to the individual's needs based on readiness to quit, level of addiction, and his/her support system. The cessation service contractor provides Project Filter with monthly reports including, but not limited to, call volume, demographics of callers, referral sources and number of NRT orders. The cessation service also provides evaluation data from a seven-month follow-up survey to past participants. The cessation service follows the nationally accepted Minimum Data Set (MDS) standards on all follow-up surveys. Goals Decrease smoking prevalence among Idaho adults and youth Reduce smokeless tobacco use among Idaho adults and youth Increase awareness of Project Filter's free cessation services and resources Increase recall of tobacco-related health messages Decrease likelihood that people will begin smoking Change the perception that commercial tobacco use is an accepted part of American culture Increase smoking quit attempts by Idaho adults VI. Grant Management Project Filter's location within the Division of Public Health, Department of Health and Welfare provides the program with added resources to manage Millennium Fund grants. Project Filter is required to meet quarterly with a Budget Analyst from the Department's Bureau of Financial Services to review program budgets and monitor expenditures. Project Filter is also supported by the Department's Contracting and Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 7 PROJECT FILTER MF APPLICATION FINAL Procurement Services Unit which ensures all contracts are legal, binding and meet Department standards. These services, coupled with federal funds, allow Project Filter to dedicate all Millennium Funds to direct services and not personnel or indirect costs. Project Filter is primarily funded through a cooperative agreement with the Office of Smoking and Health (OSH) through CDC. Grant funding covers all personnel costs, contracts with the seven local public health districts, dedicated funding to supplement cessation services costs and other small local grantee work. Project Filter employs four full-time staff and four part-time bureau support staff using federal funding. Full-Time Staff: Ivie Smart, MHE, Program Manager (FT): Ms. Smart oversees the day- to-day operations of Project Filter, manages the budget, and determines the focus and direction of program activities. Casey Suter, MA, Program Specialist (FT): Mr. Suter assists in the delivery of the program goals and manages the cessation services contract and serves as the program evaluation specialist. Corby Goade, BS - Program Specialist (FT): Assists in the delivery of the program goals, conducts research to support message development and program reporting, and coordinates and manages events and sponsorships. Jean Calomeni, MS, Senior Health Education Specialist (FT): Ms. Calomeni conducts research to support message development and promotion of services and coordinates and manages social marketing campaigns. Part-time Bureau Support Staff: Kelly Knoblock, Administrative Assistant (PT): Ms. Knoblock assists the Program Manager with budget monitoring. Kara Stevens, BA, Section Manager (PT): Ms. Stevens assists the Program Manager to ensure coordination and integration of contracts and grants and oversees management of fiscal resources. Jamie Delavan, BA, Health Equity Program Specialist (PT): Ms. Delavan assists with communication and community outreach to disparate populations affected by tobacco use. Robert Graff, PhD, Chronic Disease Epidemiologist (PT): Dr. Graff identifies, collects and correlates data from disparate sources to assess the burden of chronic disease, identifies trends along with causal risk factors, and identifies gaps and enhances the utility of existing data. VII. Evaluation Plan Project Filter will conduct regular evaluations to determine whether its counter-marketing initiatives and tactics have an impact on its outcomes as reported in Section V. The program wants to determine which methods and tactics have the greatest impact on its outcomes. Process: Project Filter will conduct a variety of counter-marketing tactics throughout the grant period, enlisting external partners and stakeholders for statewide reach. The program will contract with an external evaluator to measure the effectiveness (e.g., reach, behavior change, attitude change) of our counter-marketing efforts. Evaluation of the cessation services will be conducted through the Alere Wellbeing cessation services contract. Primary Evaluation Questions Do specific counter-marketing campaigns result in increased registrants and enrollments to cessation services and increased orders for NRT? Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 7 PROJECT FILTER MF APPLICATION FINAL Does the frequency of counter-marketing efforts (print ads, TV spots, radio) have an impact on use of Project Filter's free cessation services? Do initiatives conducted by Project Filter have an impact on the traffic sources to the free cessation services? What is the return on investment for specific counter-marketing campaigns and tactics? Assessment Methods and Strategies Analysis of cessation reports Eve nt-specific surveys Annual counter-marketing evaluation Use of other third-party analytics to evaluate the effectiveness of specific tactics (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Insights) The above information will enable Project Filter to develop more focus ed and meaningful messaging, direct its resources to those most in need of them, and identify ways to extend its outreach in cost- effective and efficient ways. The program will collaborate with other chronic disease programs within the Department of Health and Welfare and with external agencies and organizations to maximize its goals. VIII. Sustainability Project Filter will continue to supplement its counter-marketing program with funds from other sources (CDC, other grants), but will continue to rely on Millennium Funds as a means to offer cessation services. Purchasing larger media and print buys helps to make optimal use of the program's resources and reach. The program will collaborate with other chronic disease programs within the Department of Health and Welfare, with the seven Idaho local public health districts, and other local organizations to keep costs minimized and to widen its reach. Project Filter routinely makes its print materials available at no cost to other organizations. The program's sponsorship of and presence at community events help ensure that its media efforts achieve greater recall and return on investment. IX. Evidence-Based Research 1.

Our mission is to promote a safer Idaho by reducing recidivism . A three-member panel, called the Board of Correction, oversees IDOC. The governor appoints the members to serve six-year terms. In turn, they hire a director who directs all aspects of the department's operations. Brent D. Reinke has served as director since January 2007. IDOC is comprised of four divisions; 1) Education, Treatment and Reentry, 2) Probation and Parole, 3) Operations, and 4) Management Services. Each division is led by a chief who is named by the director. IDOC supervises inmates in ten prisons, four community work centers and at numerous probation and parole offices in Idaho. The department employs 1,960 staff. Most of them are correctional officers and probation and parole officers. IDOC also employs a variety of non-uniform staff. They include teachers, mental health clinicians and drug and alcohol rehabilitation specialists. II.

Statement of Need The US Justice Department shows two-thirds of drug offenders leaving state prisons will be re-arrested within three years and nearly half of released drug offenders will be returned to prison either through a technical violation or on a new sentence. In Idaho, the historic recidivism rate for parolees is 50% and for probationers is 31%. As of June 2014, 32% of offenders are on probation or parole for drug crimes and 16.4% for an alcohol offense. Based on an analysis of Level of Service Inventory (LSI) scores, approximately 40% of probationers and 70% of inmates have a current drug/ alcohol problem. This equates to 4798 probationers and 2464 parolees as of June 2014, for a total of 7262 offenders who would potentially benefit from substance abuse or recovery support services. In FY14, through combined Millennium Funding and state general funding, 4236 offenders received treatment through the provider network. Without Millennium Funding, the existing number of private provider referrals would be unsustainable and a significant portion of IDOC offenders would lose access to SUD services. V. Project Design With SUD funding, the IDOC implemented effective risk reduction strategies that combined the best portions of the public and private sectors to maximize outcomes for all stakeholders. The court system benefits from the timely delivery of accurate substance abuse assessments and offender treatment referrals, the offender benefits from a cohesive IDOC clinical intake that coordinates state funded services, the probation officer benefits from having on-site IDOC clinical staff to assist with offender programming recommendations and referrals, community providers benefit from a consistent referral system allowing for a sustainable business model, and the public benefits from a decrease in recidivism via the effective use of tax payer dollars. In allocating IDOC these state funds, the legislative guidance for the department was the implementation of a public/private managed care system that 1) increased offender access 2) was fiscally sustainable 3) set in place verifiable outcome measures and 4) reduced recidivism. 1) Increased Access In FY12, the first year of IDOC managed SUD services, 3546 offenders were served with state SUD dollars, an increase of 855 unique offenders from the previous state SUD model. In FY13, the second year of IDOC managed SUD services, 3553 unique offenders were served with state SUD dollars, comparable to FY12. In FY14, the third year of IDOC managed SUD services, 4236 unique offenders were served with state SUD dollars, an increase of 683 offenders from FY13 . Separate from Millennium Funds, state general funds support IDOC clinical staff in all seven districts. As one of their job duties, IDOC clinical staff deliver SUD aftercare treatment to reentering offenders as part of the IDOC continuum of care. From October 2013 through October 2014, IDOC clinical staff delivered reentry aftercare services to approximately 2428 additional offenders. Between SUD funding allocated to the private provider network and the personnel funding allocated for IDOC SUD staff, the majority of IDOC offenders now receive some form of SUD funded service. 2) Fiscal Sustainability In FY14, the IDOC was appropriated $1,859,200 in Millennium Funds and $5,276,400 in state General Funds for SUD services (excludes $1,083,400 allocated to the Bonneville County Wood Pilot Project). IDOC has managed the SUD budget to maintain fiscal discipline, permit immediate offender access to Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 8 FINAL MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 care and allow the private provider network access to a steady funding source to maintain their business model. 3) Outcome Measures Via utilization of the Level of Service Inventory- Revised (LSI-R), IDOC will measure the reduction in overall criminogenic risk levels, reduction in criminal attitudes and orientation, and reduction in assessed substance abuse need. Additionally, IDOC is implementing offender treatment \"Pathways\" for community supervision. \"Pathways\" is short for the IDOC Correctional Program Pathways, which is an evidence based approach to address criminogenic risk and needs in a systematic, timely and comprehensive manner. Based on assessed risk, assessed need, offender behavior and legal requirements, offenders are assigned an appropriate Treatment Pathway in the community. All Pathway information will be stored in the IDOC's electronic Offender Management Database to measure Pathway outcome effectiveness. Initial implementation of the IDOC Pathways is projected to be Spring 2015. Cost Data: Treatment c ost per unique SUD client (FY14) $1345 ($5,698,015 /4236) Community -based Supervision per Offender (annual) $1438 Average Incarceration Cost per Inmate (annual) $20,972 In FY14 the Idaho prison population decreased by 1.2% from the previous fiscal year. 4) Reduce Recidivism To measure recidivism, the SUD program will use the standard IDOC recidivism measurement as determined by the Board of Correction. The Board chose a three year window for recidivism analyses. As the IDOC SUD service matrix was implemented on September 1, 2011, initial program participants are now reaching the three year window required to qualify for recidivism analysis. To gauge preliminary recidivism outcomes, IDOC compared offenders with a likely substance use problem who received \u00a719-2524 SUD funded treatment against offenders with a likely substance use problem who did not participate in \u00a719-2524 SUD funded treatment. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 8 FINAL MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 Preliminary outcomes show a 4% higher rate of probation success for the \u00a719-2524 SUD participants, though a longer time frame for data collection is necessary to draw reliable conclusions. Further analysis is also required to determine the impact of specific variables on probation success, such as timely offender access to services, effective supervision practices, housing stability, employment stability and access to mental health services. Initial outcome measures are not available at this time for the reentry and risk to revocate populations. VI. Grant Management The grant will serve felony offenders who will benefit from substance use disorder treatment delivered by private community providers rather than through incarceration in a state facility. Millennium Funds are used only for direct client care as outlined in the IDOC Service Matrix (attached addendum). The IDOC SUD direct service budget of $7,186,600 (FY15) is allocated for drug & alcohol treatment services (assessments, outpatient and intensive outpatient care) and recovery support services (case management, drug testing, safe/sober housing, life skills and transportation). Based on clinical necessity and funding availability, eligible offenders receive up to 200 days of treatment services in a full treatment episode. A drug and alcohol treatment episode can include up to 60 days of initial pre-treatment, followed by a 90 day Stage I and a 90 day Stage II treatment service. Corresponding recovery support services are also available in each treatment stage, with an exception of safe & sober housing, which has a maximum benefit of 90 days. Based on clinical need and budgetary demands, offenders on occasion are authorized services beyond the standard service matrix. Flow of offenders through probation and substance abuse treatment 7760 Number of total PSI Intakes March 2012 - March 2014 4656 Went from Pre-Sentence to Probation 1118 Program 709 1466 73.4% 69.4%966 2112Diagnosed with a Substance Abuse Problem defined as .4 or higher on Substance Abuse Domain on LSI Remained on Probation Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 6 of 8 FINAL MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 Every business needs an infrastructure to make it successful. To manage the program, there is 1 substance abuse director , 2 clinical supervisors , 3 program coordinators and 2 IT staff. There are seven District Clinical Teams, one for each main probation and parole office. Each clinical team is comprised of a Licensed Clinician, who supervises at least one Drug & Alcohol Rehabilitation Specialist. Their responsibility is to meet court and legislative mandates, as well as implement best clinical and correctional treatment practices. The primary roles of the clinical teams are: 1) Administer court mandated \u00a719-2524 pre-sentence GAIN-I assessments; 2) Submission of SUD service requests via WITS for priority populations; 3) Evidence based program delivery; 4) Assign and/or ensure appropriate assignment to the IDOC Treatment Pathway; 5) Stakeholder resource. VII. Evaluation Plan 1. Primary evaluation questions to answer The IDOC will evaluate performance and outcome measures of the SUD Program. Specifically, the Department will track and evaluate the following: program completion rates; assessed need of program participants; length of time to complete the program; cost per offender per service received; risk reduction measures as a result of program participation; and recidivism rates for program participants. 2. The assessment methods/strategies to be used The IDOC will use the following strategies and/or standardized measures to track outcomes: GAIN-I assessment results administered through Idaho's Web Infrastructure for Treatment Demographic data received from WITS Services as reported in the Correctional Integration System (CIS) Program completions tracked in discharge reports from the managed service contractor Costs of program participation by service type Reduction in criminogenic risk level as measured by overall Level of Service Inventory- Revised (LSI-R) score Reduction in criminal attitudes and orientation via administration of the Level of Service Inventory- Revised (LSI- R) Reduction in assessed substance abuse need via administration of the Level of Service Inventory- Revised (LSI-R) Probation/parole revocations and/or other reoffending behavior tracked in IDOC's offender management and tracking system VIII. Sustainability Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 7 of 8 FINAL MILLENNIUMFUND _GRANTFY16 1. How other resources will be secured The aspiration is to receive sustainable funding through state general fund dollars. 2. How the organization will support the project in the future The design and implementation of the Justice Reinvestment Act will guide IDOC system enhancements in the coming years. IDOC will follow the analysis, policy development and outcome performance recommendations of this special legislative committee. One early impact from the committee was support for an increase to the IDOC SUD budget to permit service expansion to reentering parolees. IX.

Additional goals include the maintenance of a public/private managed care system that increases offender access, is fiscally sustainable and reduces recidivism. Rationale or Justification for Project : The US Justice Department shows two-thirds of drug offenders l eaving state prisons will be re-arrested within three years and nearly half of released drug offenders will be returned to prison either through a technical violation or on a new sentence. In Idaho, the historic recidivism rate for parolees is 50% and for probationers is 31%. Though lower than the national numbers, it remains an area needing improvement. As of June 2014, 32% of offenders are on probation or parole for drug crimes and 16.4% for an alco hol offense. Based on an analysis of Level of Service Inventory (LSI) scores, approximately 40% of probationers and 70% of inmates have a current drug/ alcohol problem. This equates to 4798 probationers and 2464 parolees as of June 2014, for a total of 7262 offenders who would potentially benefit from substance abuse or recovery support services. In FY14, through combined Millennium Funding and state general funding, 4236 offenders received treatment through the provider network. Without Millennium Funding, the existing number of private Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 5 FINAL IDOC MILLENNIUMFUND_REPORT FY14 29SEP2014 provider referrals would be unsustainable and a significant portion of IDOC offenders would lose access to SUD services. Project Summary : This project coordinates for felony offenders the delivery of community based s ubstance use disorder treatment and recovery support services, rather than service delivery through incarceration in a state facility. By delivering evidence-based treatment via a public/private partnership , offenders accessing services are at a reduced risk to reoffend with corresponding cost avoidance to the state in reduced incarceration rates. The network consists of skilled clinicians that utilize best practices in the treatment of addictions. Community based treatment and recovery support providers are granted facility approval by Department of Health and Welfare and are contracted through the current Managed Services Contractor (MSC) to treat the offender population. To manage the provider network, the IDOC partners with the state Management Services Contractor (MSC) to maintain service deliverables, fiscal accountability and oversee provider quality assurance. Offenders must meet an intake eligibility criteria consisting of clinical need, criminogenic risk and judicial mandates . The priority population is court ordered \u00a7 19-2524 cases mandating state funded assessment and treatment. The secondary service population is 1) offenders who are reentering the community from a period of incarceration and 2) offenders on community supervision who present a risk to revocate due to continued drug/alcohol usage. Service eligibility and client referral is determined and conducted by IDOC clinical teams comprised of 2- 6 staff in each judicial district. The IDOC clinical teams also manage pre-sentence GAIN-I Administration, conduct offender intakes, programmatic pathway assignment, deliver correctional programs, serve as a clinical resource to probation and parole officers, and act as a district liaison to the provider network. Geographic Area Covered : Statewide throughout the seven judicial districts. E ach judicial district contains at least one urban county served, plus a mixture of rural and frontier counties. Project Outputs : See Project Outcomes P roject Outcomes : In allocating IDOC these state funds, the legislative guidance for the department was the implementation of a public/private managed care system that 1) increased offender access 2) was fiscally sustainable 3) set in place verifiable outcome measures and 4) reduced recidivism. 1) Increased Access In FY12, the first year of IDOC managed SUD services, 3546 offenders were served via the private provider network with state SUD dollars, an increase of 855 unique offenders from the previous state SUD model. In FY13, the second year of IDOC managed SUD services, 3553 unique offenders were served via the private provider network with state SUD dollars, comparable to FY12. In FY14, the third year of IDOC managed SUD services, 4236 unique offenders were served with via the private provider network with state SUD dollars, an increase of 683 offenders from FY13. Separate from Millennium Funds, state general funds support IDOC clinical staff in all seven districts. As one of their job duties, IDOC clinical staff deliver SUD aftercare treatment to reentering offenders as part of the IDOC continuum of care. From October 2013 through October 2014, IDOC clinical staff delivered reentry aftercare services to approximately 2428 additional offenders. Between SUD funding allocated to the private provider network and the personnel funding allocated for IDOC SUD staff, the majority of IDOC offenders now receive some form of SUD funded service.

IDOC has managed the SUD budget to maintain fiscal discipline, permit immediate offender access to care and allow the private provider network access to a steady funding source to maintain their business model. 3) Outcome Measures Via utilization of the Level of Service Inventory- Revised (LSI-R), IDOC will measure the reduction in overall criminogenic risk levels, reduction in criminal attitudes and orientation, and reduction in assessed substance abuse need. Additionally, IDOC is implementing offender treatment \"pathways\" for community supervision. \"Pathways\" is short for the IDOC Correctional Program Pathways, which is an evidence based approach to address criminogenic risk and needs in a systematic, timely and comprehensive manner. Based on assessed risk, assessed need, offender behavior and legal requirements, offenders are assigned an appropriate Treatment Pathway in the community. All Pathway information will be stored in the IDOC's electronic Offender Management Database to measure Pathway outcome effectiveness. Initial implementation of the IDOC Pathways is projected to be Spring 2015. Cost Data: FY14 t reatment cost per unique SUD client (provider delivered services ) $1345 ($5,698,015/4236) Community -based supervision cost per o ffender (annual) $1438 Average incarceration cost per i nmate (annual) $20,972 In FY14 the Idaho prison population decreased by 1.2% from the previous fiscal year. 4) Reduce Recidivism To measure recidivism, the SUD program will use the standard IDOC recidivism measurement as determined by the Board of Correction.

Many mental health professionals are not adequately trained in substance abuse (Cardoso et al., 2006; Carroll, 2000). Many substance abuse counselors are not trained in evidence-based practices (Miller et al., 2006). Statement of Need \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 6 Similar to national trends, Idaho's counselors are in need of specialized training in EBPs for substance use disorders. According to a recent statewide survey conducted by Boise State faculty , only one third of LCPs and LCPCs in Idaho report formal training in substance abuse screening, assessment, and treatment (Esp & Lee, 2011). Statement of Need Screening Assessment Treatment 32% 35% 27% *N = 204; 75% female; mean age = 49 \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 7 Statement of Need The RADAR Center has had numerous requests for materials and resources that support EBPs for tobacco and substance abuse prevention and intervention. The current RADAR library includes only a few EBP resources. Expansion of EBPs would greatly increase RADAR's capacity to serve practitioners statewide. Example of EBP Library Expansion Relapse Prevention Family Matters The Drinker's Check Up Parenting Wisely Seeking Safety Keep a Clear Mind BASICS 12-Step Facilitation \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 8 Most EBPs for substance abuse do not easily find their way into practice (Miller et al., 2006). Disseminating therapist manuals and one-time workshops are common practice in exposing practitioners to EBPs, but supervision enhances proficiency (Miller et al., 2006). Thus, a multi- tiered approach including providing resources, specialized training, and individual supervision is required to effectively disseminate EBPs and enhance practitioner adoption and use. Statement of Need \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 9 Goals and Objectives Goal: Increase the number of practitioners in Idaho who have access to resources, specialized training, and supervision in EBPs for tobacco and substance use disorders prevention, cessation, and treatment to increase adoption and use of these practices. Objective 1 Disseminate EBP resources in substance abuse prevention, cessation, and treatment to Idaho practitioners and agencies. Objective 2 Provide trainings and supervision in EBPs in substance abuse screening, assessment, brief intervention, and referral. \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 10 Millennium funding would allow the Institute to follow the evidence- based multi-tiered dissemination approach including: Program Activities Tier Program Activity Number Served Statewide Resources Disseminate EBP resources in tobacco and substance abuse prevention and treatment to Idaho practitioners and agencies. > 1500 residents and professionals Training Provide 12 EPB one -day trainings, online training, and a pre -conference workshop at ICADD. > 400 professionals Supervision Provide individual supervision in EBPs to enhance proficiency. 100 hours \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 11 Activities: Resource Dissemination Add EBPs to online catalog of resources (>1900 products) Add links to online resources for EBPs Post training and events Update RADAR Website Conferences State Prevention & Support Conference Idaho Conference on Alcohol and Drug Dependency Social Media Facebook, Twitter, Newsletter Provide Outreach \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 12 Activities: Training and Supervision Basic and advanced-level in-person trainings will be developed and provided to practitioners statewide.

Motivational Interviewing (MI) MI is an evidence-based clinical approach that helps people with mental health and substance use disorders make positive behavioral changes. \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 14 Activities: Training and Supervision We selected SBIRT and MI for the following reasons: Screening, assessment, brief intervention, and referral are fundamental skills needed to work with clients to reduce tobacco and other substance use. Both mental health and substance abuse practitioners should be competent in both SBIRT and MI. Proficiency in SBIRT and MI meets the SAMHSA \"No Wrong Door\" standard. SBIRT and MI are cost-effective relative to other types of treatments. \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 15 Evidence for SBIRT and MI Brief interventions, including SBIRT and MI, are as effective as extended treatment conditions for substance abuse (Moyer et al., 2002). SBIRT is associated with significant reductions in heavy alcohol use and drug use across a range of health care settings and a range of patients (Madras et al., 2009). Brief MI is effective in the treatment of excessive alcohol use (Vasilaki et al., 2006) as well as a broad range of behavioral problems and diseases (Rubak et al., 2005). \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 16 Criteria for Submission This grant request meets all three criteria required for submission -1) Tobacco Prevention and Cessation -2) Substance Abuse Cessation or Prevention -3) Tobacco or Substance Abuse Treatment RA DAR will disseminate EBP resources for tobacco and substance abuse prevention, cessation, and treatment. The ISA team will train and supervise practitioners in SBIRT and MI which research shows are effective treatments for the reduction or cessation for tobacco and substance abuse. \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 17 Grant Management Boise State's Division of Research and Economic Development will provide oversight and support for grant administration through its Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP). OSP staff are trained in best practices in research administration at institutions of higher education. OSP staff will work closely with the Institute and RADAR Directors who will directly oversee accounting and tracking of project funds. Both Directors have significant experience in federal grant management and contract management. \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 18 Budget Budget $60,551 Personnel Support $20,940 Personnel Fringe $13,381 Materials and Supplies $2,000 Travel $19,374 Indirect Costs (20%) $116,246 Total Request FY16 \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 19 Maximization of Funding Funds will be maximized through - Systematic program evaluation: -Development of EBP resource base and trainings available for future dissemination. -Capacity building through providing resources, training, and supervision to practitioners and agencies that adopt and implement EBPs. Process Measures Outcome Measures Number of resources distributed Increased EBP knowledge Number of trainings offered Increased EBP skills Participant satisfaction Increased adoption of EBPs \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 20 Summary Only one third of Idaho LPCs and LCPCs surveyed have received formal training or preparation in substance abuse screening, assessment, and treatment. Effective dissemination of EBPs requires a multi-tiered app roach including providing resources, trainings, and supervision. This project will use this evidence-based approach to disseminate EBPs that are effective in preventing and reducing tobacco and substance use. We respectfully request funding to support this project. \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 21 THANK YOU Diana Doumas, Director Boise State University Institute for the Study of Addiction Email dianadoumas@boisestate.edu \u00a9 2012 Boise State University 22 References Carroll, J.

ISA is housed within the College of Education and the College of Health Sciences. ISA Leadership Team includes 3 faculty members, Drs. Doumas, Esp, and Miller and the Director of The Idaho Regional Alcohol Drug Awareness Resource (RADAR) Center, Ms. Carrigan. ISA also employs 2 additional staff and 2 student workers. ISA Leadership Team members engage in an active program of research focusing on prevention and intervention of substance abuse, dissemination of addictions-related material to the community, and coordinating and providing addiction courses and addiction trainings for students and practitioners in the community and statewide. ISA collaborates with community partners through the Boise's Drug Free Communities Coalition including the local school district, city and county government, law enforcement, and community businesses and organizations. In addition, the Director has collaborated with the coalition for the past nine years to deliver and evaluate the efficacy of substance abuse prevention and intervention programs throughout the state. The RADAR Center is a sponsored program under ISA. The mission of the RADAR Center is to provide no-cost substance abuse prevention and addiction treatment resources to Idahoans. The RADAR Center is Idaho's only resource referral center for substance abuse information, holding the unique position of being a resource hub for institutions, agencies, and community members throughout the state.

Statement of Need This project aims to decrease substance use disorders in the state of Idaho by disseminating evidence- based practices (EBPs) to mental health and substance abuse practitioners through providing educational resources, specialized trainings, and individual supervision in EBPs . SAMHSA's \"no wrong door\" policy states that effective systems must ensure that an individual needing substance abuse treatment will be identified, assessed and receive services, either directly or through appropriate referral, no matter where treatment is entered. Research, however, indicates many mental health professionals do not receive adequate training in substance abuse (Cardoso, Pr uett, Chan, & Tansey, 2006 ; Carroll, 2000). Researchers have also found that counselors who have specialty training i n treating substance abuse are clinically more effective than those who have not received the same specialized education (Carroll, 2000). Boise State faculty recently conducted a study to determine the competency of licensed professional counselors (LPCs) and licensed clinical professional counselors (LCPCs) to screen, assess, treat and refer substance abuse clients. Of the 1741 LPCs and LCPCs in Idaho, 204 (75% female; mean age = 49) responded to a mailed survey. Although 60% of the participants indicated they have received formal training in how to refer a client with substance abuse, only one third indicated they were trained to screen (32%), assess (35%), and treat (27%) these clients. Additionally, t he RADAR Center has had numerous requests for materials and resources that support EBPs for both prevention and intervention. Thus, Idaho's counselors are in need of both resources and specialized training in EBPs for screening, assessment, and treatment for clients with substance use disorders. Unfortunately, most EBPs for substance abuse do not easily find their way into practice (Miller, Sorensen, Selzer, & Brigham, 2006 ). Thus, methods for effectively disseminating EBPs are crucial. According to Miller and colleagues, although disseminating therapist manuals and one-time workshops are common practice in exposing practitioners to EBPs, proficiency is enhanced through individual performance feedback and coaching (e.g. supervision) . Incentives may also be needed to encourage providers to adopt new approaches. Based on these recommendations, Millennium grant funding would enable ISA to 1) disseminate substance use/abuse prevention and treatment EBP resources across the state of Idaho, 2) provide specialized trainings (in-person and online) in EBPs to mental health and substance abuse practitioners across the state, 3 ) provide supervision of EBPs to practitioners to enhance proficiency, and 4) incentivize providers by providing resources, training, and supervision at minimal or no cost. The mission of ISA is statewide dissemination of substance use/abuse prevention and treatment resources, including tobacco use prevention and cessation, and enhancement of opportunities for addictions-related training. The RADAR Center has received verbal acknowledgement from the state Office of Drug Policy (ODP) and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Tobacco Program that they will provide level funding for the center in FY2016. Although these funds provide a solid base for operation, they are insufficient to fully operate the center and these sources of support do not focus specifically on the dissemination of EBPs . Millennium funding would allow the RADAR Center to expand the range of EBP resources offered across the state of Idaho. ISA currently provides 1-3 trainings per year in Boise for a fee. Millennium funding would allow ISA to provide 12 one-day trainings, an online training, and one p re-conference workshop at ICADD at no cost, serving up to 400 practitioners in Idaho. We have selected Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI) for this grant as mental health and substance Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 4 of 8 MILLENNIUMFUND ISA FY16 abuse practitioners should be competent in these EBPs as they are fundamental to screening, assessment, brief intervention, and referral. Further, research indicates brief interventions, including SBRT and MI, are more effective than control conditions and are as effective as extended treatment conditions for substance abuse (Moyer, Finney, Swearingen, & Vergun, 2002). Researchers have also found SBIRT is associated with significant reductions in illicit drug use and heavy alcohol use, as well as functional domain improvement, across a range of health care settings and a range of patients (Madras, Comptom, Avula, Stegbauer, Stein, & Clark, 2009). Similarly, brief MI is effective in the treatment of excessive alcohol use (Vasilaki, Hosier, & Cox, 2006), as well as a broad range of behavioral problems and diseases (Rubak, Sandbaek, Lauritzen, & Christensen, 2005). We request Millennium Funds for this project for the following reasons: 1 ) many practitioners statewide depend on RADAR Center substance abuse prevention and treatment resources to enhance their work - over the last five years, the RADAR Center served patrons from all 44 Idaho counties, processed 9,380 orders, disseminated 640,000 pieces of print material and made 12,258 video loans and 2) only one third of LPCs and LCPCs in Idaho indicate they have received formal training or preparation in substance abuse screening, assessment, and treatment, and thus, require training and supervision in EBPs. V. Project Design The project goal, objectives and activities are listed in Table 1. Goal: Increase the number of p ractitioners in Idaho who hav e access to resources, specialized training, and supervision in evidence -based practices for substance use disorders Objective 1: Disseminate EBP resources in substance abuse prevention and treatment to Idaho practitioners and agencies. Objective 2: Provide trainings and supervision in EBPs in substance abuse screening, assessment, brief intervention , and referral. Activity 1 : Keep resources that support EBP from federal partners (e.g. SAMHSA, NIDA, NIAAA, CDC) in stock. Activity 1 : Develop and provide 6 one day in - person basic trainings in the EBP screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT). Activity 2 : Obtain print materia ls and videos that support EBP. Activity 2 : Develop and provide 6 one-day in - person trainings in the EBP Motivational Interviewing (MI). Activity 3 : Develop resources that support the dissemination of EBPs, including fact sheets, non - proprietary worksheets etc. Activity 3 : Develop and provide a 7 hour online training i n EPBs SBIRT and MI. Activity 4 : Maintain a listserv of patrons who wish to receive updates from RADAR electronically. Activity 4 : Offer a pre -conference one da y workshop on EBPs at ICADD. Activity 5 : Promote webinars on EBP by federal partners (e.g. ATTCs, PIRE, OJJDP, NAADAC, MCTFTC) by posting information on the RADAR website. Activity 5 : Provide one-on-one supervision of EBPs to practitioners in Idaho. Activity 6 : Promote and support local Idaho training of EBP by suppl ying materials to trainers as requested including the ATTCs, BPA, ISPSC, ICADD, IDHW and Idaho colleges and universities. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 5 of 8 MILLENNIUMFUND ISA FY16 The project's success or failure will be measure through the evaluation plan detailed in the next section. The evaluation will include both process measures (e.g. number of resources distributed, number of trainings offered, and participant satisfaction) as well as outcome measures (e.g. increased knowledge among RADAR patrons and training and supervision participants). This project follows evidence-based practice by disseminating EBPs through resources, specialized trainings and individual supervision. VI. Grant Management Boise State University's Division of Research and Economic Development provides oversight and support for grant administration through its Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP).

Evaluation Plan The goal of the project is to decrease substance use disorders in Idaho by increasing the number of practitioners utilizing EBPs. We are most interested in 1) which EBP resources, trainings, and supervision are most requested and 2) do resources, trainings, and supervision increase knowledge, skills, and use of EBPs statewide . The evaluation plan includes both process and outcome measures (see table below). IS A and RADAR Center will track the process measures and surveys will be used to assess RADAR patron and training and supervision participant satisfaction and changes in knowledge, skills, and use of EBPs. Stakeholders will be involved in the evaluation process through survey participation and information will be use to guide resource purchase, training content, and type of supervision provided. Resource Dissemination Specialized Training and Supervision PROCESS MEASURES Number and types of EBP resources ordered and disseminated/loaned Number of EBP factsheets and worksheets developed and disseminated Number of patrons and the number of emails promoting EBP sent through the RADAR listserv Number of webinars on EBP that are promoted through the RADAR websi te and social media platforms Number of materials provided to partner organizations training on EBP Participant satisfaction with EBP resources OUTCOME MEASURES RADAR patron knowledge of and skills in EBPs increased RADAR patron use of EBPs increased PROC ESS MEASURES Number of SBIRT and MI trainings provided Number of SBIRT and MI training participants Online training developed and provided Number of online training participants Number of supervision sessions provided Number of practitioners receiving supervision Participant satisfaction with in -person trainings, online trainings, and supervision OUTCOME MEASURES Practitioner knowledge of and skills in EBPs increased Practitioner use of EBPs increased VIII. Sustainability ISA will continue to provide trainings in EBP as part of its mission to enhance opportunities for statewide addictions-related training. Developing a low cost online training and partnering with ICADD to offer free pre-conference trainings are part of the plan to sustain low cost trainings statewide. ISA will continue to seek funding to provide these trainings at low to no cost. The Office of Drug Policy and IDHW Tobacco Prevention programs have committed to support the RADAR Center to research and disseminate substance abuse prevention and treatment resources as long as their funding continues. The Center will work toward developing other partnerships and seek out grant or foundation support when needed to remain fully operational. A Boise State Foundation acc ount has been established for the Center and efforts will be expanded to reach potential donors. Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 7 of 8 MILLENNIUMFUND ISA FY16 IX.

Idaho Legislative Services Office This Page Intentionally Left Blank Millennium Income Fund FY 2016 Grant Request Evaluation Process The grant evaluation process allows the Joint Millennium Fund Committee to give thorough and fair consideration to an ever-growing number of grant proposals. Ahead of the December Joint Millennium Fund Committee meeting, staff will make all grant proposals, presentations, and supporting materials available to its members electronically. Every grant proposal should be read and evaluated by each committee member prior to the December meeting. Prior to the December meeting, or during the hearing process itself, each committee member should rank every grant proposal a funding priority of high, medium, low or none. Additionally, if a member thinks an alternative funding amount should be provided, then that amount should be noted. Once completed, committee members should return their ratings to legislative staff, who will assign a numerical score of three, two, one, or zero respectively, to the funding priority ratings of high, medium, low or none. As a result of this process, each grant request will have a score of between thirty and zero. Staff will then prepare a list of the grants, ranked in order of funding priority score starting with the highest score. The prioritized list will be made available to all committee members during, or just prior to the next scheduled meeting. The Joint Millennium Fund Committee will make a recommendation on an amount to be awarded for each grant proposal, if any, until the desired funding level has been achieved, or all funds have been exhausted. By law, the committee is required to present its recommendations annually to the Legislature. To accomplish this, staff will prepare a written report of the committee's recommendations, and the co - chairs of the Joint Millennium Fund Committee will make formal presentations to the Joint Senate Finance - House Appropriations Committee for its consideration. The final report will be made available online.

At the discretion of the judge, these cases c an be handled in the adult or juvenile syst em. National research indicates that early age use of these substances by adolescents affe cts their development, increases their potential for probable addiction and recovery from addiction, as well as, increase propensity for future law violations Project Summary : There are two Tobacco/Alcohol Court Diversion projects . This was the third year of the project in the 7 th District. The 7th District coordinator meets with the cour ts, county commissioners, police and others to discuss how better to address underage tobacco an d alcohol offenders in their communities. Most counties in the 7th District now screen all underage offenders wi th the GAIN SS instrument to determine if Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 2 further evaluations are necessary to address substance used issues. Each county is making a commitment within their capability to use the proper co mbination of probation, courts, and treatment in addressing the risk/needs of underage tobacco/alcohol offenders. The Fifth District TAC has been in effect for several year s. The process in the Fifth allows police officers to cite underage Alcohol and Tobacco offenders directly into the juvenile court. The juveniles and their families next appear before the judge who will order t he youth to complete the evidence-based program after a plea or trial. A Gain SS evaluation is required for alcohol violators to assure education and treatment is appropriate. Violators are ordered to complete the Toward No Drugs program, a best practice program, as well as, community service and pay penalties or costs. Family members may also be ordered into education or treatment programs. If the juvenile successfully completes the program, usually within ninety days, their case will be dismissed. A number of juvenile probation offices and judges at tended ICADD in May to learn from Dr. Ed Latessa on, \"What Works with Youthful Off enders: The Principles of Effective Intervention,\" and \"What Works with Youthful Offenders: The Characteristics of E ffective Programs and the Barriers to Effective Implementation.\" Geographic Area Covered : The entire 7th District is currently covered by the TAC in that region. In the 5th District currently, Twin Falls, Jerome and Gooding Counties are participating. Minidoka and Cassia Counties are using some of the enhancements of this approach to address their cases. Project Outputs : The Millennium Funds are used to pay for coordinators salaries. Project Outcomes : A total of 122 participants enrolled in tobacco and alcohol diversions in the 5th and 7th Judicial Districts. Most participants (71%) were male and most (78%) between the ages of 15 and 18. The other 22% of participants were between the ages of 10 and 14. Th e TAC has been successful in engaging parents. Most parents (92%) participated with youth at a high level. Of the 122 participants who completed their particip ation in fiscal year 201 4, 117 (96%) successfully completed all requirements. In one year of follow-up, 19% of the participants who co mpleted 5th district or 7th district tobacco and alcohol diversion programs in 2013 recidivated.

Intervention is different from prevention because a behavior has occurred that has been br ought to the attention of police or other legal authority and is case specific. Substance abuse assessments can be used to assess and evaluate juv eniles being considered for intervention. Prevention effort s target general populations. Rationale or Justification for Project : Under Idaho law, underage tobacco and alcohol cases are considered misdemeanors. At the discretion of the judge, these cases c an be handled in the adult or juvenile syst em. National research indicates that early age use of these substances by adolescents affe cts their development, increases their potential for probable addiction and recovery from addiction, as we ll as, increase propensity for future law violations. Project Summary : When a juvenile has committed an act bringing the juv enile to the attention of police or other legal authority, under the Juvenile Correction Act of 1995, appropriate cases can be diverted from further Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 2 judicial process by utilizing Youth Courts. Appropria tely, addressing youthful offenders who smoke, use substances, or engage in status offenses can prevent future law violations, which is the ultimate goal. Geographic Area Covered : Youth Courts partially funded by Millennium Funds ar e located in several 3rd District counties, Ada County, Bannock County, Bingham Co unty and Bonneville County. Project Outputs : Millennium Funds are used to compensate Youth Cour t Coordinators and for some operating expenses. There are five Youth Court Coordinators. Project Outcomes : In total 329 children participated in Youth Courts in fi scal year 2014. Most of the participants (72%) were 15 years or older when referred. The remaining part icipants (28%) were between the ages of 10 and 14. Youth Courts have been successful in engaging parents. Parents' initial cooperation was rated high for nearly all participants (99%). Youth court is run by student vo lunteers who are supervised and assi sted by adult volunteers. During fiscal year 2014, 983 students and 42 adults voluntee red over 4100 hours to run youth courts, averaging about 4 hours of volunteer time per person. Youth were required to complete a variety of intervent ions, treatments, or other requirements. One of the most common requirements was community servic e. During the year, 316 (28%) of participants completed 1111 hours of community service. Another common requirement was writing essays, 27% of youth were required to complete essays. Some parti cipants engaged in other interventions such as individual or drug and alcohol counseling, tobacco ce ssation, school contract s, behavior contracts, or other interventions. Youth courts had a high success rate with 89% of participants successfully completing youth court. In one year of follow-up, only 14% of offenders who completed youth court in 2013 recidivated.

Intervention is different fr om prevention because a behavior has occurred that has been brought to the attention of police or other le gal authority and is case s pecific. Substance abuse assessments can be used to assess an d evaluate juveniles being consider ed for intervention. Prevention efforts target general populations. Rationale or Justification for Project : Status offenses traditionally, tr uancy, curfew, incorrigible, runawa y, and tobacco and substance abuse, have been referred to as \"gateway cr imes.\" Nationally reports show, the majority of juveniles who are involved in serious criminal behaviors usually began by committing these \"gateway crimes. All status offender programs are expected to use evidence-bas ed practices to address and treat offenders. Project Summary : When a juvenile has committed an act bringing the juv enile to the attention of police or other legal authority, under the Juvenile Correction Act of 1995, appropriate cases can be diverted from further judicial process by utilizing diversion programs such as the Youth Courts and Status Offender programs Idaho Legislative Services Office Page 2 of 2 or the Tobacco and Alcohol Diversion Court. Approp riately, addressing youthf ul offenders who smoke, use substances, or engage in status offenses can prev ent future law violations, which is the ultimate goal. Geographic Area Covered : Status Offense Programs exist in Ada, Twin Falls, Jerome, Gooding, Blaine, Lincoln, Camas, Minidoka, Cassia, Bannock, Teton, Le mhi and Madison Counties. Project Outputs : County juvenile probation staff or contract staff pr ovide direct services and case management for Status Offenders deemed appropriate to divert to status offenders programs. Status offender programs vary but generally consist of: mental health and substance abuse assessments and treatment, tracking, mediation, mentoring, family training and counseling, indivi dual counseling, drug and alcohol counseling, anger management, in-home services, behavior and school contacts, smoking and substance abuse cessation classes, cognitive thinking classes and test ing for tobacco, alcohol, and substance use. Project Outcomes : A total of 252 participants enrolled in status offender programs in fiscal year 2014. Participants were mostly male (62%). Very few participants (fewer t han 3%) were younger than 7 years old or older than 17 years old. The median age of participants was 14 years old. Status offender programs have been successful in engaging parents. T he parent(s) of 98% of participants took part in programing. Status offender programs required offenders to engage in one or more intervention strategies during participation. Strategies include community service, m ediation, psychosocial rehab ilitation, writing essays, in-home services, family, individual, or drug and alcohol counseling, anger management, behavior contracts, school contracts and prog rams, detention tours, or \"other\" interventions. The most common interventions required were community service (33% ), individual counseling (21%), school contracts and programs (13%), behavior contracts (12% ) and \"other\" interventions (20%). In fiscal year 2014, Status Offender programs required 84 offenders to complete 1614 hours of community service.
