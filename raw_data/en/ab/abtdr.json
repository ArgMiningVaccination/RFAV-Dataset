The General Anthroposophical Society's 2022 annual meeting took place this past weekend at the Goetheanum, with much of it live-streamed in four languages including English. The theme, which is also announced as a new theme or motif for the year, is \"Moving in the in-between: wanting society - shaping the future.\" At the AGM Dr. Constanza Kaliks was affirmed for a second, seven-year service on the Goetheanum Executive Council. Treasurer Justus Wittich was able to report that a serious shortfall for 2020 had been overcome by a surplus in 2021, including pandemic help given voluntarily by the Solothurn regional government. Our own Nathaniel Williams, who will become international Youth Section leader next year, made a short appearance by Zoom. Country Representatives and General Secretaries were introduced. The Calendar of the Soul. We are happy as in years past to be able to offer [suggested dates from Herbert Hagens](https://www.anthroposophy.org/the-calendar-of-the-soul) for the use of this amazing resource created by Rudolf Steiner in 1912. There is a brand-new book on the Calendar from The Kolisko Institute, as well as a webinar recording. \"To contemplate the destinies of human beings with reverence and awe, that is something our times demand of us.\" \u2014 Rudolf Steiner The new issue of being human which members have just received includes a number of articles about the social healing needed after two years of the pandemic and other stresses. The most destructive fires in Colorado history last December spread throughout Boulder County with winds up to 100 mph, and destroyed more than 1,000 homes. To help children release the shock of this experience, occupational therapist Ana do Valle and friends Christine Summerfield, Tom Altgelt and Kathleen Thompson created a ten-minute interactive e-book and video. Eugene Schwartz has been providing online trainings since long before the pandemic. He recently offered \"Does Waldorf Still Matter\" and now in April is tackling the topic of \"Gender and Identity: The Dilemma of the Divided Soul.\" As spring takes over from winter, much of the country will find bees coming out of hibernation\u2014a few of them at least. The well-being of the bees is a lynch-pin of ecological health. We are so fortunate to have the Spikenard Bee Sanctuary and to see it expanding programs and trainings. The Biodynamic Demeter Alliance is the result of several years' work to unify the Biodynamic Association and Demeter USA; and now a development director is being sought. A 2020 statement said, \"Our conscious intention is to infuse an understanding and application of Rudolf Steiner's social threefolding throughout the structure and work of the Biodynamic Demeter Association, with balanced effort in the spheres of culture, rights, and economy.\" Peter Selg on \"Anthroposophy as resurrection science\": \"As the festival of the commemoration of Christ's earthly death and resurrection, Easter marks a turning-point of time. But the earth continues to be a place of war and destruction, of suffering, need and hardship. The human heart is at the center of this conflict, as the organ of empathy and of hope, of trust in the future.\" [View the full text, images, and live links...](https://secure.anthroposophy.org/neonPage.jsp?pageId=90&) [March 27, 2022](https://secure.anthroposophy.org/neonPage.jsp?pageId=87&) Images include details with links to the full images of three new works by Patrick Stolfo: \"Divine Sophia,\" in cast crea-stone with amber patina; in wood a \"Winged Being\"; and then a \"Fallen Figure\" carved in cherry wood. COMPASSIONATE ACTION Serguei Krissiouk is an anthroposophically trained physician currently involved in research and therapeutic work with chronically ill children, as well as a clinical homeopathic practitioner, translator, and musician. He has been involved at the New York Branch for many years and last Thursday night gave a talk and Zoom presentation on the spiritual and historical dimensions of the \"War in Ukraine,\" his country of birth. The forthcoming print being human features an article by Karine Munk Finser, MEd, about the new Kairos Institute sponsored by the Center for Anthroposophy in New Hampshire in collaboration with the Transdisciplinary Healing Education Program at Antioch University New England. ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE IN ACTION We also have a link to a YouTube recording of a lecture at the Rudolf Steiner Haus Stuttgart featuring Philipp Busche, a specialist in internal medicine and gastroenterology, and head of the internal medicine and medical training of the anthroposophic Arlesheim Clinic near the Goetheanum, on their work with Covid. The Anthroposophic Health Association is having a conference, \"The Mysteries of Healing: Realizing AnthropoSophia,\" July 19-22 in Kimberton, Pennsylvania. Keynote speakers are three MDs: Ursula Flatters, James Dyson, and Marion Debus. Coming up very soon is a three day seminar from the Association for Anthroposophic Psychology. James Dyson from the UK and Simon Kuttner from Israel are the lecturers for \"Soul Matters: The Journey So Far.\" HEALING, FREEDOM, CHILDREN \"Leadership in Transformation\" (LiT) is a project of the World Social Initiative Forum, an international network of spiritually-inspired grassroots initiatives addressing poverty, marginalization and social injustice. It started March 22 with a talk by Aonghus Gordon, \"Freedom in Culture: From limitation to potentiality (The 'I as I').\" Next up, on April 6th, is Carrie Schuchardt, MEd, of the House of Peace, who has lived and worked with refugees since 1980. Re:Generation Education has been working on \"trauma-informed education\" in the Middle East for many years now. Co-founder Shepha Schneirsohn Vainstein, a long-time Waldorf parent and advocate, was the keynote speaker at our 2017 fall conference in Phoenix, Arizona. Their latest newsletter begins with the sobering observation that \"When war breaks out, children are the least responsible \u2014 but suffer the greatest consequences.\" ARTS IN ACTION The IVAA is the international federation of anthroposophic medical associations. They recently offered a series of four short videos, to view or download here, on arts therapies, in German with English subtitles. a mini-documentary series with four distinct episodes focused on the therapeutic areas of painting, music, modelling and speech. The M.C. Richards Program at FreeColumbia is named for a notable poet, potter, essayist, painter, and teacher, involved in the Camphill movement. \"The program is one contribution toward her question: 'What are some practices to strengthen and enliven living images, in contrast to mechanical and life-destroying images? And how may thinking itself be taught in ways that promote life, rather than estrange us from it?'\" Applications for the 2022-2023 cohort are being accepted. Next weekend (April 1-3), Lightforms Art Center is hosting Urban First Aid from the Circles for a Renewal of Culture. The lineup is remarkable.

REFLECTION: THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE A look at last month's email from John Bloom, with the central questions of reincarnation and karma. RUDOLF STEINER: SUFFERING & SOPHIA From his lectures on February 13, 1923, soon after the burning of the First Goetheanum.

VISUAL ELEMENTS... this time are details from the sculpture and drawing of well-known artist and teacher Patrick Stolfo; his work will be featured on the cover and in the gallery of our winter-spring being human print edition. HOLY NIGHTS The grand idea of an \"evolution of consciousness\" is important for understanding why anthroposophy speaks of spirit and spirituality and religious figures like the Christ and the Buddha and of theological subjects like higher intelligences\u2014but is not a religion... but has been reawakening and deepening the meaning of this season. IMPROV: Actress and teacher Laurie Portocarrero shared a holiday story of events transforming themselves this year. [View the full text, images, and live links...](https://secure.anthroposophy.org/neonPage.jsp?pageId=78&) [December 13, 2021](https://secure.anthroposophy.org/neonPage.jsp?pageId=75&) The HOLY NIGHTS offering from the ASA will be a reading of the ancient Sumerian saga \"The Epic of Gilgamesh.\" GOETHEANUM TALKS online in December include Peter Selg on \"Hope and trust in the future,\" and Constanza Kaliks addressing \"World becoming - the seed meditation.\" The remarkable HAWTHORNE VALLEY ASSOCIATION has a podcast \"Roots to Renewal,\" launched as part of its fiftieth anniversary celebrations. Our own John Bloom, whose involvement with HVA goes back many years, was a guest on episode #6, speaking with executive director Martin Ping. SPIKENARD FARM HONEYBEE SANCTUARY is a well-organized and inspiring entryway into the bee world. Let's salute WELEDA, the healthcare company inspired by anthroposophy that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. LITERARY ARTS AND EPIGRAMS John Urban shared several one-line poems on the theme of \"Building the Temple of the Heart.\" The website theliteraryarts.com continues to be a outstanding exposition of the life of the Section for the Literary Arts and Humanities. MUSIC OUT OF CONFINEMENT Mark McAlister introduced us to pianist Ben Cruchley, who has created an online lecture-recital featuring piano sonatas by two prominent composers of the Terez\u00ecn Concentration Camp, anthroposophist Viktor Ullmann and Gideon Klein. MUCH WAS EXPECTED at the beginning of the 20th century. Along with greatness of many kinds, it gave us terrible demonstrations of Rudolf Steiner's warning, that without the new vision of human nature and potential that is anthroposophy we would soon face the \"grave of all civilization,\" and that our goal must be to create new culture and a \"future worthy of the human being.\" Pope Francis seemed to speak from the same insights recently. \"Let us stop this shipwreck of civilization,\" he said, visiting a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. \"Let us stop ignoring reality,\" Francis said. \"How many conditions exist that are unworthy of human beings? How many hotspots [are there] where migrants and refugees live in borderline conditions, without glimpsing solutions on the horizon?\" The Advent season prepares us for the joy of new birth. Today it is up to all of us to make the new birth of humane civilization happen. It is good to be able to report on many bright spots.

Some fine observations linger from the October conference, including from Dr. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler's keynote. \"Biography work is heart research.\" The photos this time remind us of the busy lives of insects. HYBRID Our fall conference was successful in weaving a good number of face-to-face gatherings into a larger and very satisfying digital package. How can we do this at all levels. META The \"battle for reality\" is intensifying. From 2010 social media stepped squarely into the middle of individuals' relations with each other. Making extraordinary profits, these apps opened this intimate zone of human relations to access by influencers and advertisers and governments and corporations. Those with funds learned to manage it all with machine intelligence that was trained over vast fields of personal data gather by the same social media... Now comes the metaverse, or omniverse, or comprehensive artificial reality. It sounds and looks too boring to bother with, but it will get better, shaped by our own reactions to it, and its purpose is to contain and exert maximum influence over our consciousnesses. Are there any human beings who might be qualified to manage such a project? NATURE INSTITUTE It is both confounding and inspiring to behold this tiny team in Ghent, New York, working with such care and penetration to awaken us to the sublimity of nature, maya, at just the moment when a corporation worth a thousand billion dollars and hosting two billion customers, and controlled by one man, has turned to summon us into an artificial replacement for nature. Do spend some time at www.natureinstitute.org STEINER ONLINE It is surprising to learn at his retirement from the RSArchive and e.Lib that Jim Stewart began this internet project before the World Wide Web and browsers were invented in 1989-90. Learn about the new e.Librarian... IN BRIEF A new Waldorf Education eNews arrived ten days ago from Rebecca Moskowitz, Executive Director, Advancement, of AWSNA, and it is full of valuable content including an hour video conversation with young alums for current students. Accreditation is an important and difficult challenge for higher education organizations. Gradalis Waldorf Consulting & Services in Colorado (their Gradalis Teacher Education offerings are advertised in our print being human) received the good news of a five-year continuation of accreditation from ACCET, the Accreditating Council for Continuing Education & Training. It's important to the movement that Antioch University offers a Master of Education degree in Waldorf Education, through AU New England. While the world situation is challenging in many ways, it is hard not to be impressed with the quality and relevance of anthroposophical initiatives. Can we learn how to communicate that these many parts are an outline for building a global culture that will serves all of us and the Earth?

AAC 2021-2022 The experience offered by the new year of the Applied Anthroposophy Course (AAC) seems really quite extraordinary. A wonderful recent email from the AAC team, Tess Parker, Angela Foster, and Jordan Walker, named the first semester \"seed series\" guides: Brian Gray, Laura Summer, Seth Jordan, Julia Porter, Alex Tuchman, Chris Burke, Anne de Wild, Megan Durney \u2014 and linked further to a faculty page that adds Bastiaan Baan, Lisa Romero, Patrick Kennedy, S\u00e9amus Maynard, Jaimen McMillan, Orland Bishop, and Sea-Anna Vasilas, with still more to come.

Virginia Woolf spoke of a couching operation performed by great literature, using the old term for removal from the eye of lenses clouded by cataracts. John Keats: first stanza of his ode \"To Autumn\": Samuel Taylor Coleridge: \"To the Autumnal Moon\" DR. SELG TO DR. PAGE Christiane Marks translated and shared with us some time ago a May entry in the German-language magazine Das Goetheanum. In it Peter Selg greeted Dr. Traute Page on her 102nd birthday, offering in salute a 1924 birthday poem by Rilke, Handinneres (\"Palm of the Hand\") also ably brought over into English by Christiane Marks. [https://anthroposophy.org/in-honor-of-your-birthday/](https://anthroposophy.org/in-honor-of-your-birthday/) EURYTHMY UPDATE The movement art of eurythmy has been strongly affected by the pandemic, and it is good to see it coming back into real space as well as online. THE NEW FIVE COLLECTIVE Cedarwood Waldorf School in Portland, Oregon, has been creating and perfecting an exhibit space for visual arts, The Art Hall. The New Five Collective were exhibiting when the pandemic closed the space, and it is open again now through Oct 2nd with a new show by these artists: MJ Connors Davison, Robin Lieberman, Patricia Homan Lynch, Jannebeth R\u00f6ell, and Jenny Siegel. CHANGES AFOOT Council Chair Helen-Ann Ireland has [a new blog post](https://anthroposophy.org/changes-afoot-council-chairs-update/) detailing changes in the ASA General Council, whose volunteer members represent the three regions, serve as a board of directors for the ASA as a non-profit organization, and through study and conversation carry consciousness for the life of anthroposophy across the USA. SILLY? A certain number of bumper stickers saying \"anthroposophy\" with the lemniscate (a.k.a. infinity symbol) have been given out at conferences. Margaret Runyon sent in a picture of her bumper and suggested we solicit others \u2014 \"Just a summer fun suggestion!\" If you have such a sticker, send a photo, perhaps with a summer travel background, or a bit of a story. THE OCTOBER CONFERENCE Our \"hybrid\" national conference, co-produced with the Central Regional Council, is a rich and imaginative and interactive presentation. It is also a bit more complicated, offering access for all online with added face-to-face gatherings in at least six locations. You should do a little planning now!

We link to conversations by Lynn Jericho recorded shortly after: Ground Zero & The Human Soul: The Search for The New Ordinary Life. Informed by anthroposophy, they \"move the listener from the individual to the global, from the present to the future.\" We also link to T.H. Meyer's Reality, Truth, and Evil (2005, Temple Lodge) and to America's Global Responsibility: Individuation, Initiation and Threefolding, by Yeshayahu (Jesaiah) Ben-Aharon. SKETCHES, VIRTUES In Santa Cruz, CA, an exhibit of pen and ink drawings recalls the late art historian and anthroposophist Johannes Gaertner (at the R. Blitzer Gallery). He is known today for Worldly Virtues, an elegant collection of reflections on the great classic virtues by which we may endeavor to live our lives. TACT\u2014 Implies the awareness of another person's feelings, the anticipation of his reactions, and the adroit removal or avoidance of psychological difficulties and social frictions. Tact is less a function of feeling then one of intelligence. If women are said to be more tactful than men, it is because they are more intelligent, particularly with regard to human relations. (Baby girls smile earlier than baby boys.) Tact requires what Rudolf Steiner called \"moral fantasy.\" One must be able not only to see but to feel the world as another might, thus not merely refraining from saying the wrong thing but sometimes actually not saying or doing the right thing. Tact is the courtesy of the heart. INNER FIRE Beatrice Birch of the Inner Fire initiative in Vermont shared a link to a story by Amy Biancolli, published on the website Mad in America - Science, Psychiatry, and Social Justice. \"Inner Fire: Where Seekers Have a Choice \u2014 A Vermont residential community program helps people taper or stay off medications with holistic care embedded in a pastoral setting.\" IN BRIEF Some events don't fit the posting requirements of our calendar: A new series of five MysTech Study Groups are starting this week of September 13th.

It's a lovely statement, and it deepens quickly when set beside Goethe's statement that Colors are the deeds and suffering of light-sufferings?-and his view of color emerging from between darkness and light. It becomes something worth pondering.
