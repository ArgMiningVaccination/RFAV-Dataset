However do not, I repeat, do not see Dr Clay. She had no idea what she's doing and complains if you ask her to do something different or to not do something she would normally do. She rolled her eyes when I asked her not to do something that had previously popped two of my ribs out and caused major headaches. She is not patient friendly. She also could not adjust my neck which has never happened to me before. Chiropractors who work only weekends probably just shouldn't be working. - Renae W. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Amazing patient! - Christopher Frank The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 1 5 1 Don't go to the one at 245 East Bell Rd. Ste 5, in Phoenix! DON'T SIGN UP FOR THE WELLNESS PLAN!! This place is a RIP OFF!!! You better be ready to go at least 6 times in 2 months! They charged me $158.00 for adjustments/treatment I never received. They force you to sign a \"contract\" when you're in pain and are willing to sign anything to feel better. I was told it's a $108.00 plan with the option to cancel if I didn't need future adjustments and just make the $45 office fee if I needed future treatment. It was $29 original visit and $79.00 for two more visits after that. This is NOT the case. After my initial treatment, it was determined my problems were with soft tissues and not a Spinal injury. Therefor I didn't require any additional treatment. They kept all the original $108.00 on March 20th when I first went in. I'm okay with that because it was an emergency and on a Sunday. But then charged my account again a month later for another $79.00 on April 20th. When I called the office to resolve this matter, \"Jennifer\" just kept telling me I signed a \"contract\" and it's for two months. If I had known the real and actual numbers, I would not have agreed to $258.00 worth of Chiropractic adjustment that I really never needed. ~ It doesn't matter that there never was any appointments made, and/or cancelled, and they lost revenue, such as a Doctor or Dentist office. This is a walk-in practice ,therefore they never lost money because of negligence on my part. To the credit of the Doctor who helped me, he did a good job. Was friendly and helpful. - Jen B The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 1 5 1 We did a walk in visit at 2:50 they close at 5pm and we were told they could not see us because they had 1 appointment at 3pm and 1 Dr. just came in for an adjustment but the front desk clerk seemed as If he didn't want to bother doing the paperwork. Said \"I could ask the Dr but I pretty much know what he's going to say\"...I said don't bother if he's going to say no, we just drove from Buckeye, not that matters. We won't be returning. I'm not begging a business to take my money. - jane K The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Dr Nick is great and is a chiropractor that listens and is adjusts me to keep me mostly pain free, despite low back issues. I highly recommend this soc. - Rebekah Stevens The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Dr Kenny is very patient and open to listening to your situation. I have a severe back so it's difficult for me to find chiropractors who can work with my situation and Dr Kenny can effectively. - Jan J. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I prefer getting an adjustment to getting put on pills that just mask the problem and then actually no improvement and a much longer process. Dr. Nick in the Glendale office has helped me do that. He knows what my body needs for that adjustment to keep me feeling better which makes life so much more enjoyable. I couldn't do it without him. I would highly recommend him to everyone if you want to enjoy your life more and feel better. - Janus L. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Dr. Martin is probably the best doctor I have ever had at the Joint. Explains everything he does and is very thorough. - Audrey S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I have been attending the Joint for many years in several coties. Today's visit was the most personalized and detailed evaluation I have experienced. Dr. Martin took the time to review my history and examine my current health health. I look forward to returning when he is in. Thank you so much! - Andrew W. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Dr. Nick and his staff are exemplary in their customer service and services provided. Thank you Dr. Nick and staff for a happy back! - Brenda K. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Dr. Nick @ The Joint Arrowhead Ranch office is intuitive with his adjustments. He is personable and truly cares. - Kyle S.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Joann fixed problems I was not even aware of! She was incredibly personal, kind, and gentle. She genuinely cared, not only about my adjustment, but about my health needs as a whole person. I will definitely be back. - Hanako S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I seeked out chiropractic care because most of my life I have suffered from neck/back pain. I didn't like using Tylenol on a daily basis because a lot of the time it didn't help with the pain. Ever since coming to the joint; it has helped my neck/back pain tremendously. I am always satisfied with the adjustment. I would highly recommend the joint because they know how to keep your body aligned. - Laura D. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I've been getting my neck adjusted on and off at The Joint for about a year, 59th & 101 finally fixed me! 12/18 sessions Dr. Nick - I said I'm tired of hurting, I'm coming twice a week. He said ok - he adjusted me. I was laying in the bed with a pillow between my knees and the muscles at L4 - L5 released for the first time in 20 years! I am PAIN FREE! Stick with treatments. YOU are worth it and so am I! Thanks Dr. Nick, my quality of living has increased drastically! - Gina L.

I know the moment I need an adjustment because life just doesn't feel right without the joint. - Tracey C. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Dr. Nick is one of the best chiropractors I have ever been to. He adjusts me quite well and has helped with a number of aches & pains. He always greets me by name and with a smile and listens to any questions or pains I may have. His bedside manner is superb and I enjoy our weekly visits, and miss him when he's gone! - Lynn S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Dr. Nick is awesome! I have been coming to see him for over a year and couldn't be happier.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I have chronic pain from several accidents and need chiro care 2-3, sometimes 4x, a week.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I had some pinched nerves and after I got that all straighten out, I continued chiropractic because I feel better afterwards. I used to get massages and chiropractic is better in my opinion. Dr.Nick is awesome some doctors personalities make things awkward but he makes me feel very comfortable and I go out of my way to see him at this location. - Terri C.

Even sometimes when my body doesn't want to cooperate. As a paramedic with past - concussive syndrome, chiropractic is vital to my healing. I'm glad I found The Joint! - Lori G. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I came into the Joint when I moved to Arizona the summer of 2018. I had been a chiropractic for years and I'm a true believer in regular chiropractic care. After having hip problems just before my move, I was eager to find a good chiropractor when I moved. I was so blessed to find Dr.Martin. He not only diagnosed my hip issue. adjusted me, but he continued to keep me in great mechanic condition.I had been to orthopedic doctors who could not diagnose or treat me. I went from limping to returning to running trails in 45 days. That I didn't expect! Chiropractic care works and is my first line of defense for all ailments. - Beverly R. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Since finding The Joint Chiropractic last year, I have felt better little by little. After visiting Dr.Nick a few times my back/hip pain became really non-existent. I had some pain/tightness in my neck that would not go away. Dr. Martin was able to adjust my neck very delicately one day when i was in a lot of pain. He taught me some stretches and after about 5 visits my neck pain/tightness is almost gone. I highly recommend The Joint Chiropractic. These doctors work with you closely to pinpoint the source of the pain. I felt better than I have in years!!! - Nathan M. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I have suffered from a bad back my entire life. I have been to numerous chiropractors throughout the years, and have found The Joint to be the answer. The ability to stop in for a quick weeks adjustment without an appointment is a lifesaver. Dr.Nick is by far one of the best; his attention to detail keeps me in-line and feeling good. - Erin M. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I suffer from chronic headaches. I learned that my neck being out of place was the source of my persistent headaches. With an active lifestyle, regular visits to The Joint keep the headaches manageable. I am a firm believer that chiropractic care should be part of a regular wellness plan. - Zoe R. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I am a Dental Student, So between studying and working all day, my neck and back ache.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Dr.Nick was informative and explained the process in way that made me feel comfortable, as I was a little nervous.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I have never seen a chiropractor before coming to the joint off the 101 and 59th ave and let me just tell you, this is the most comfortable physically I have ever been. I'm on the wellness plan which makes my visits super affordable and the hours make it easier to get here on my days off and it's super quick and convenient for a regular adjustment. Thank you guys for being awesome! ! - John H. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 Great healthcare resource.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I started coming here a few months ago. I was having neck, back and leg aches for years and I tried all sorts of \"quick fixes\". Ever since I've been coming to The Joint, I've felt more balanced, my neck has felt looser and more flexible than I have in years! I also love that I never have to make an appointment and the monthly program works for my budget. - Alysia D. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I have a shoulder injury that affects the surrounding areas, as well as a desk job. While they can't do anything about the shoulder injury, they do relieve the pain and discomfort. They also get my lower back/hips back into alignment after a week spent on my butt. The difference they make in my pain management can't be described! - Autumn B. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (623) 455-5748 20280 N. 59th Avenue, Suite #107 Glendale, AZ 85308 5 5 1 I was experiencing a lot of migraines and headaches.
