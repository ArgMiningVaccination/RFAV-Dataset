[What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. This supplement has been used in connection with the following health conditions: |Used for||Why| | | 2 Stars Pumpkin Seed Oil Refer to label instructions | | Pumpkin seed oil has been shown to relieve BPH symptoms, possibly because it improves bladder and urethra function. In many parts of Europe, herbal supplements are considered standard medical treatment for BPH. Although herbs for BPH are available without prescription, men wishing to take them should be monitored by a physician. Pumpkin seed oil has been used in combination with saw palmetto in two double-blind human studies to effectively reduce symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Only one group of researchers has evaluated the effectiveness of pumpkin seed oil alone for BPH, but the results of their large preliminary trials have been favorable. Researchers have suggested the zinc, free fatty acid, or plant sterol content of pumpkin seeds may account for their benefit in men with BPH, but this has not been confirmed. Animal studies have shown that pumpkin seed extracts may improve the function of the bladder and urethra; this might partially account for BPH symptom relief. | | 1 Star Depression Refer to label instructions | | Pumpkin seeds contain L-tryptophan, and for this reason have been suggested to help remedy depression. Pumpkin seeds contain L-tryptophan, and for this reason have been suggested to help remedy depression. However, research is needed before pumpkin seeds can be considered for this purpose. It is unlikely the level of L-tryptophan in pumpkin seeds would be sufficient to relieve depression. | | 1 Star Kidney Stones Refer to label instructions | | Two trials from Thailand reported that eating pumpkin seeds reduces urinary risk factors for forming kidney stones. Two trials from Thailand reported that eating pumpkin seeds reduces urinary risk factors for forming kidney stones. One of those trials, which studied the effects of pumpkin seeds on indicators of the risk of stone formation in children, used 60 mg per 2.2 pounds of body weight\u2014the equivalent of only a fraction of an ounce per day for an adult. The active constituents of pumpkin seeds responsible for this action have not been identified. | | 1 Star Parasites Refer to label instructions | | Pumpkin seeds have purported effects against tapeworms. Given their safety, they are often recommended as an addition to other, more reliable therapies. Pumpkin seeds (Cucurbita pepo) have purported effects against tapeworms. Given their safety, they are often recommended as an addition to other, more reliable therapies. In Germany, 200-400 grams are commonly ground and taken with milk and honey, followed by castor oil two hours later. Tapeworms can cause severe illness and should be treated only with medical supervision. In China, pumpkin seeds have been shown to effectively treat acute schistosomiasis, a severe parasitic disease occurring primarily in Asia and Africa that is transmitted by snails. The assistance of a physician is required to help diagnose and treat any suspected intestinal parasite infection. Traditional Use (May Not Be Supported by Scientific Studies) Native Americans used pumpkin flesh and seeds for food. Their use of the seeds for the treatment of intestinal infections eventually led the United States Pharmacopoeia to list pumpkin seeds as an official medicine for [ parasite ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1243003#hn-1243003-need-to-know) elimination from 1863 to 1936.1 Native Americans also commonly used pumpkin seeds to treat a variety of kidney problems. The flowers were used topically to soothe minor injuries.2 Eclectic physicians (doctors who recommended herbal medicine) at the end of the 19th century used pumpkin seeds to treat [ urinary tract ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1283006#hn-1283006-need-to-know) problems and [ gastritis ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1217004#hn-1217004-need-to-know), and to remove tapeworms and roundworms from the intestines.3 [] How It Works How It Works Pumpkin seeds contain several major groups of active constituents: essential fatty acids, [ amino acids ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2800002#hn-2800002-uses), phytosterols (e.g. beta-sitosterol) minerals, and vitamins. Other major constituents include mucilaginous carbohydrates and minerals. Pumpkin seed oil has been used in combination with [ saw palmetto ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2161003#hn-2161003-uses) in two double-blind trials to effectively reduce symptoms of [ benign prostatic hyperplasia ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1169004#hn-1169004-need-to-know) (BPH).4 , 5 Only one open label trial evaluated the effectiveness of pumpkin seed oil alone for BPH.6 Animal studies have shown that pumpkin seed extracts can improve the function of the bladder and urethra. This might partially account for BPH symptom relief.7 Curcurbitin is a constituent in pumpkin seeds that has shown anti-parasitic activity in the test tube.8 Human trials conducted in China have shown pumpkin seeds to be helpful for people with acute schistosomiasis, a severe parasitic disease occurring primarily in Asia and Africa that is transmitted through snails.9 Preliminary human research conducted in China and Russia has shown pumpkin seeds may also help resolve tapeworm infestations.10 , 11 The assistance of a physician is required to help diagnose and treat any suspected intestinal [ parasite ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1243003#hn-1243003-need-to-know) infections. Two trials in Thailand have reportedly found that eating pumpkin seeds as a snack can help prevent the most common type of [ kidney stone ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1228000#hn-1228000-need-to-know).12 , 13 Pumpkin seeds appear to both reduce levels of substances that promote stone formation in the urine and increase levels of substances that inhibit stone formation. The active constituents of pumpkin seeds responsible for this action have not been identified. How to Use It Pumpkin seed oil extracts standardized for fatty acid content have been used in BPH trials. Men with BPH have used 160 mg three times per day with meals.14 Approximately 5-10 grams per day of pumpkin seeds may be needed for kidney stone prevention.15 As a treatment for parasites, 200-400 grams are ground and taken with milk and honey, followed by castor oil two hours later. This treatment, however, should not be attempted unless under medical supervision. [] Interactions Interactions with Supplements, Foods, & Other Compounds Interactions with Medicines [] Side Effects Side Effects Pumpkin seeds may cause an upset stomach, but are otherwise extremely safe. There is no reason to believe pumpkin seeds should be avoided during [ pregnancy ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1251000#hn-1251000-need-to-know) or breast-feeding as they are commonly consumed as food during these times without any indication of harm.
