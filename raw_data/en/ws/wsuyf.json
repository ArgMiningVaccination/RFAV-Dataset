When used correctly, holistic treatments offer advantages over traditional addiction treatment. Additionally, they give people tools to use in their daily life that help them avoid relapse. What is Holistic Drug Detox? Traditional addiction detox focuses mainly on treating the physical effects of drug withdrawal. In contrast, holistic detox, in turn, expands focus to the entire person. This means that it addresses the issues that are affecting them emotionally, mentally, and spiritually to encourage healing for their body, mind, and spirit. Additionally, holistic detox is very effective in helping people in addiction treatment experience positive and longer-lasting recoveries. It also allows individuals to gain a better understanding of their own identity and become more confident in themselves. Holistic drug detox programs in Nashville do this in a few different ways. They focus on all-natural methods for pain and stress relief, boost immunity, teaching ways to build a more balanced lifestyle, and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Lastly, this results in an improvement in their physical and mental health as a whole. Holistic Drug Detox vs Medical Drug Detox Holistic drug detox and [medical detox](https://brentwoodspringsdetox.com/programs/medical-detox/) both have their places in addiction treatment. However, there are differences. Holistic drug detox focuses on natural, drug-free ways to heal a person. It can include nutritional counseling. People who have spent a lot of time addicted to drugs or alcohol often have poor eating habits. Doctors can help address the damage already done by this. Holistic therapy helps keep any more damage from developing. The person learns how to eat healthy for their unique needs. They learn how to plan nutritional and delicious meals that support their physical health. Medical detox helps a person deal with emotional damage done by addiction. A person who stops abusing substances often finds the first days and weeks emotionally taxing. They may experience depression, anxiety, and other mood-related symptoms. Medical detox can include medications that help ease those symptoms. Nevertheless, holistic detox approaches these same symptoms by addressing them both now and in the future. Medical detox methods are temporary and happen during the initial treatment. Holistic therapy like yoga, massage, and meditation can continue long after detox. Furthermore, many people who have been in recovery for a long time rely on these methods. Practicing these and other types of holistic therapy regularly can help in two ways. They can ease emotional symptoms that occur during and after detox. They can also help prevent them from developing again. Holistic treatment does not include [medication-assisted treatment](https://brentwoodspringsdetox.com/services/medication-assisted-treatment/), unlike medical detox.

First, detox facilities assess a person to determine which treatments are best for each individual. The most common holistic detox options include: Acupuncture For thousands of years, traditional Chinese medicine has used acupuncture during healing practices.
