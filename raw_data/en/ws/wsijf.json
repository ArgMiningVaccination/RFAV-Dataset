Treatment options typically consist of nutrition recommendations, nutraceuticals, lifestyle changes, and/or hormones. A follow-up appointment is usually scheduled in one to three months to discuss effectiveness of current treatment strategies, retest and review labs and determine whether changes to the treatment approach need to be made. An initial TCM consultation typically ranges from 30-90 minutes. The visit begins with a thirty minute consultation about the patient's current concerns and goals. The provider will then recommend one or several TCM modalities such as, acupuncture, nutritional recommendations, herbal therapy, and/or meditation. If acupuncture is recommended/requested, the length of the visit will be 60-90 minutes, with 30 minutes spent resting with needles in place. Follow up visits are generally 45-60 minutes. The number of sessions necessary varies on severity and duration of the condition. Acute, less severe issues may only take one session. Chronic and/or severe conditions may take 3-12 sessions. "}
