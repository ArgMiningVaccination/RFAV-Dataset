In addition to feeling better physically, mentally, and emotionally, we are less likely to develop illnesses and have a better quality of life. The lungs might not immediately spring to mind as one of the components of our health essential, but they also age and degenerate with time. Besides aging, other factors such as smoking, illnesses, chemical or pollutants exposure, and poor dietary habits, can also play a role in influencing lung health. Those who eat fewer fruits, vegetables, and nuts have a speedy decline in lung functioning capacity. These food products contain antioxidants, plant-based phytochemicals, and anti-inflammatory properties, which reduce inflammation in our lungs and improve lung functions. According to various studies, lifestyle modifications with nutrient-rich diet intake can help protect the lungs from chronic inflammation and reduce symptoms of lung diseases and conditions. Best food to improve lung health It is essential to consume a nutrient-rich diet to improve overall health. But certain foods may help protect your lungs and prevent lung diseases progression, such as: - Turmeric Curcumin, a bioactive compound of turmeric, is a natural antioxidant and possesses antibacterial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. It helps protect us from various health conditions, such as eye, skin, heart, brain, and lung diseases. Curcumin improves respiratory health and repairs lung damage. - Tomatoes Tomatoes and tomato products contain lycopene (a carotenoid antioxidant), which reduces airway inflammation in people who are chronic smokers or have asthma. Tomatoes also contain vitamin C, which also reduces inflammation and fights against free radicals. According to various studies, our body absorbs lycopene better when we consume cooked tomatoes. - Beetroot Beetroots and greens are rich in nitrates, which relax blood vessels and reduce elevated blood pressure levels, improving lung functions in people with pulmonary hypertension and COPD. In addition to nitrates, beetroot and greens contain vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and carotenoid antioxidant, which improve immunity and lung health. - Leafy greens Leafy greens, such as kale, spinach, and beet greens, contain various vitamins, antioxidants, and plant-based phytochemicals that reduce inflammation and decrease the risk of lung cancers. - Apple It is a famous saying regular apple consumption keeps a doctor away. Well, it's true. Apples are rich in quercetin (a phytonutrient) helps reduce asthma risk and COPD complications. Apples also have an anti-inflammatory property that reduces airway inflammation and reduce oxidative stress.
