Laura Howell, MD, Komal Kochhar, MBBS, MHA, Robert Koehler, PharmD, Christina Mandzuk, BSE,Brittany Sutton, MPH, Javier Sevilla-Martir, MD, and Deborah Allen, MD Purpose: This study measured the knowledge and use of herbs among Hispanics and assessed their ex- periences when discussing herb use with their physician. Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were collected from 620 Hispanic patients seeking treat- ment in urban health centers. Results: Most (80.3%) reported using herbs. Herb users were more comfortable speaking Spanish (91.9% vs 80.2%) and had been in the United States less than 5 years (47.0% vs 29.4%). More users considered herbs as drugs (60.5% vs 39.6%). Users were more aware that herbs could harm a baby iftaken during pregnancy (56.4% vs 36.0%). The majority did not know the English name for 23 of the 25herbs. A majority indicated their physician was unaware of their herb use. Few (17.4%) responded thattheir physicians asked about herb use. Only 41.6% thought their physician would understand their herbuse, and 1.8% believed their physician would encourage continued use. There were no signicant differ-ences between herb users and nonusers in their perception of patient-physician communication levels. Conclusion: Primary care physicians need to be aware that most Hispanic patients are likely to use herbs. It is important to initiate and encourage discussion of their patient's interest in and use of thesetherapies. (J Am Board Fam Med 2006;19:566 -78.) The use of complementary and alternative medical therapies (CAM) has dramatically increased in theUnited States over the past 2 decades. The percent-age of Americans using CAM increased from33.8% to 42.1% from 1990 to 1997, 1,2and it is believed that the percentage has since increased.Most patients consider herbal remedies to be as safeand effective as patented medicines and continue touse various types of CAM. 3 The sale of herbal medicines is growing by ap- proximately 20% per year and is the largest growtharea in retail pharmacy, far exceeding conventionalmedicine. 4Educated, young to middle-aged, non-black, and nancially well-off women are more likely to use CAM.1-3,5-8Of those regularly taking prescription medicines, nearly 20% concurrentlytake at least one herb, a high-dose multivitamin, or both. 2,9Patients generally report using CAM to augment their conventional medical care ratherthan as a result of their dissatisfaction with main-stream medicine. 5,10 Herbal remedies are generally marketed in the United States as dietary supplements and are reg-ulated as such under the 1994 Dietary SupplementHealth and Education Act. 9In contrast to conven- tional drugs, herbal remedies do not undergo rig-orous clinical trials and postapproval surveillance todene their effectiveness and relative safety. Con-sequently, clinical practitioners generally do nothave available to them the scientic data needed toweigh the risks and benets of herbal remedies asthey do for conventional pharmaceutical medica-tions. 4There is evidence to suggest that herbal remedies may contain ingredients that can worsenmedical problems and interact with specic pre-scription medications.

Downloaded from probably under-recognized and under-reported.4,12 Oral use of herbs constitutes a greater potential for signicant health risk than non-ingested treatmentmodalities because many herbs may be therapeuticat a low dose but toxic at higher doses. In addition,interactions between herbs and drugs may increaseor decrease the pharmacological or toxicologicaleffects of either component in addition to the syn-ergistic therapeutic effects that may complicate thedosing of long-term medications. 13 Effective physician-patient communication is vi- tal to reduce the dangers of herb-drug interactions.Physicians with an open mind to CAM may bemore likely to hear from their patients about theirherb use as studies show that as many as one half totwo thirds of patients do not tell their physiciansabout their use of herbs. 1,3Knowledge and mutual respect are the foundations of negotiating conflictsthat arise from approaching an illness from 2 dif-ferent belief and value systems. 14Recent literature suggests the importance of providing training inCAM to medical students and residents and en-couraging them to communicate these issues withpatients. 4,8,15One study shows that physicians' ex - hibit better question-asking skills with non-His-panic white patients, compared with Hispanic pa-tients, and that patient ethnicity did not influencepatient reported use or physician-patient commu-nication about CAM. 8It was also observed that resident physicians with less clinical experiencewere more likely to ask patients one or more ques-tions about their use of CAM. 8 Even though herb use has increased over the past decade, the number of US pharmacy schoolsoffering courses addressing their use has de-clined. 15According to one study, only 9 of 77 pharmacy colleges maintain pharmacognosy as acourse in their curricula. 15,16As a result, today's pharmacy school graduates may not be adequatelyequipped to respond to their patients' request forinformation on herbs. 15Over one-half (52.0%) of the patients purchased their herbs in drugstores orgroceries, where pharmacists would be available,but none of them received any herb informationfrom the pharmacist. 17Another study found that more practicing pharmacists, compared with phar-macy students, felt that pharmacists should notbecome practitioners of CAM (26.6% vs 0.0%). 18 This underscores the need for physicians to recog-nize an even greater responsibility to provide theirpatients with reliable information about herbs andto be particularly cognizant of the need to do so fortheir Hispanic population. Given the potential for adverse reactions and interactions associated with herbs, it is important toidentify the prevalence of herb use in specic pop-ulations and whether herb users routinely informtheir primary care physician of such use. Severalstudies have indicated that the Hispanic popula-tion, as an ethnic group, exhibits high usage ofCAM. 7,19One study revealed that Mexican-Amer - ican women were 3 times more likely to use herbsthan the general population. 19Another study in New Mexico showed that 77% of surveyed Hispanicsused herbs, compared with 47% of non-Hispanicwhites. 7Specic reasons why Hispanics may be more likely to use herbs are not clearly understood. Ferguson and Candib20concluded that minority patients, especially those not procient in English,were less likely to establish rapport with physicians,less likely to receive sufcient medical information,and less likely to be encouraged to participate inmedical decision making. Elder et al 3suggested that patients seek CAM because they cannot affordtraditional medications. A distrust of physicians orphysicians' negative responses to herb use has alsobeen identied as a reason Hispanic patients' turnto herbs. 5Studies have also found that some pa - tients believe that herb use, when combined withtraditional therapy, may result in more optimalhealth outcomes. 3 Numerous researchers14,17,21-28have examined the unique cultural health beliefs of Hispanic pa-tients, including the use of folk healing or herbs.However, few studies 17,19,29,30have actually sur - veyed Hispanic patients regarding their attitudesabout herbs and their comfort level when discuss-ing such remedies with their physicians. No studieshave been conducted in Indiana, a Midwestern statewith a rapidly growing Hispanic population. Thegoals of this study were to 1) assess Hispanic pa-tients' knowledge about herbs, 2) explore the un-derlying reasons why these patients may be morelikely to use herbs than the general population, 3)examine patients' comfort levels with discussingtheir herb use with their physicians, and 4) deter-mine the extent to which physicians inquire abouttheir patients' herb use. Methods A patient survey was conducted between October2003 and February 2004 at 5 urban health centers http://www.jabfm.org Use of Herbal Remedies by Hispanic Patients 567 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from in Indianapolis, IN, that treat high numbers of Hispanic patients. The patients were approached inthe waiting room of health clinics by bilingual re-search assistants. The research assistants identiedthe Hispanic patients visually by their ethnic ap-pearance and asked each of them (if older than 18years of age) to participate. At no time did theresearch assistants examine patients' medicalrecords or ask medical staff the ethnicity of pa-tients. It is not known how many patients refused toparticipate. All self-identied Hispanic patientsover the age of 18, who visited the study clinic sitesduring the data collection period were asked bybilingual research assistants to complete a survey asthey waited to see their physician. The survey in-strument included questions about the patient's de-mographic information, familiarity with variousspecic herbs, attitudes toward and beliefs aboutherbs, and the patient's comfort level when discuss-ing herb use with their physician. The survey in-strument was initially created in English, and thentranslated into Spanish by an individual with amedical background whose rst language wasSpanish. It was then given to another medicallyexperienced individual fluent in Spanish who trans-lated it into English to ensure concept equivalency.The Spanish version of the survey instrument wasalso examined by numerous members of the Indi-anapolis Hispanic community to ensure that ques-tions were asked appropriately and with culturalsensitivity. Research assistants interviewed patientsif they were unable to read the survey instrument.Survey completion was voluntary, no incentiveswere provided, and the subjects were assured thattheir responses would be kept condential. Thestudy received Indiana University Institutional Re-view Board approval in May 2003. Completed questionnaires were scanned into an electronic data le, veried by a research assistantand analyzed using SPSS version 12.0.1. Descrip-tive statistics including mean, median, and fre-quency distribution were calculated. /H9273 2tests were performed to determine signicant statistical dif-ferences. Values of Pless than .05 were considered statistically signicant. Results Demographic and Clinical CharacteristicsA total of 620 Hispanic individuals completed theherb use questionnaire. The herbs used in the sur-vey instrument were chosen by a consensus of nu-merous Hispanic individuals interviewed in thecommunity as to what were the most commonherbs used. Most often, the respondents were fe-male (78.7%), unemployed (56.8%), uninsured(69.7%) and had lived in the United States for lessthan 5 years (43.9%). One half (58.9%) of therespondents were in their 20s, whereas approxi-mately one tenth (12.2%) were over age 40. Morethan one half (53.0%) did not have a high schooldegree, and nearly one half (48.8%) lived with theirspouse. More than one fourth (25.4%) had at leastone child living in their household with a meanhousehold size of 4.16. More than four fths(89.2% and 89.9%, respectively) were most com-fortable reading and speaking Spanish rather thanEnglish. Less than one third (29.8%) had not seena physician in the past year, whereas more than onethird (35.5%) had seen a physician at least 3 timesin the past year. A majority (90.1%) had not seen acurandero or hierbero in the past year. Use of Herbal RemediesFour fths (80.3%) responded that they were cur-rently taking or had taken an oral herbal remedy inthe past. Two thirds (59.6%) had taken between 6and 15 different herbs during their lifetime. Onethird (30.7%) indicated they obtained their herbsfrom a Hispanic grocery store. Some indicated thatherbs were most often used to treat cough (26.3%),stomach pain (24.9%), sore throat (20.3%), men-strual cramps (19.1%), headache (8.8%), and chestpain (7.2%). Participants were asked about their use and knowledge of the English names for 25 commonlyused herbs for treatment purposes (not as foodseasonings) and whether their physicians wereaware of their use, as shown in Table 1. More thanhalf of the respondents reported that they had usedat least 1 of 10 herbs among the 25 listed. The 10most commonly used herbs were cinnamon, cloves,cumin, chamomile, garlic, onion, grass syrup, aloevera, oregano, and lemon. The majority of respon-dents did not know the English name for 23 of the25 herbs on the list. The 2 herbs for which themajority knew the English name were spider milk-weed and bitter gourd. A vast majority of the re-spondents indicated that their doctors were un-aware of their herb use. Table 2 presents the demographic characteris- tics of the herb users and non-users.

Downloaded from variables included in the analysis, only 2\u2014language and duration of residence in the United States\u2014were signicantly different between the 2 groups.Herb users were more comfortable speaking Span- ish than English (91.9% vs 80.2%) and more oftenlived in the United States for less than 5 years(47.0% vs 29.4%). The remaining 6 characteristics:gender, age, education level, employment status,health insurance coverage, and number of physi-cian visits in the past year were not signicantlydifferent between the herb users and nonusers.Two multiple logistic regression models weredeveloped to determine the extent to which de-mographic characteristics explain the use ofherbal remedies and whether or not the individ-ual informed their physician of their herb use.None of the ndings were found to be statisti-cally signicant.Knowledge and Use of Herbs Table 3 shows that the overall knowledge aboutherbs was lacking among the participants. Morethan half of the respondents felt that herbs were drugs (58.2%) and that some herbs could harm ababy if taken during pregnancy (54.3%). Herb us-ers were signicantly more likely than nonusers toknow that herbs are drugs (60.5% vs 39.6%) andthat herbs could harm a baby if taken during preg-nancy (56.4% vs 36.0%). One third believed thatsome herbs could interact with prescription medi-cations (35.1%) and that herbs were not safe to useduring pregnancy, compared with prescription orover-the-counter drugs (35.3%).

The fact that many did not know the En- glish term for the herbs they use is further evidenceof the existence of a barrier to achieving appropri-ate communications with their physician. Gordon 14 found that newly arrived Hispanics who were pri-marily from rural areas were more likely to holdtraditional beliefs and values, whereas US-bornHispanics were likely to have more assimilated at-titudes, which may explain the higher rate of herbuse in recent immigrants. Elder et al 3pointed out that the main reason given for using herbs, alone or in combination withprescribed medications, was a belief that herbswould be effective. Many of those who communi-cated with their physician spoke of acceptance andcontrol, but those who did not communicate withtheir physician mentioned traditional medicine'slimitations and the narrow-mindedness of theirphysicians. 3Patients who chose to reveal details about their herb use did so because they perceivedtheir physician would be respectful, open-minded,and willing to listen to them. 31Patients found it easier to discuss their use of CAM when they be-lieved that their physician expected them to beusing herbs. 31On the other hand, patients who chose not to reveal their herb use with their phy-sician gave several reasons for their decision, suchas the impression that their physician would bedisinterested in their herb use; the anticipation of anegative response; the conviction that their physi-cian would be unwilling or unable to contributeuseful information; and the impression that theirphysician perceives herbs to be irrelevant in thebiomedical treatment course. 31In addition, pa - tients may feel intimidated by their physicians andperceive a sense of disapproval with regard to theirphysician's views on their use of CAM. 35Similar concerns were expressed by participants in thisstudy. The majority of respondents noted that theirphysician would not know what the herbs wereused for, and one fourth felt that their physicianwould ridicule them for using herbs. Eisenberg et al 1noted that 70% of patients do not reveal their herb use to their allopathic practi-tioners. The current study indicated that for someherbs, this percentage may be much higher, as only15% indicated that they would tell their doctorabout all the herbs they use whereas three fourthsreplied that they could \"tell their doctor anything.\"Providing herb use information to ones' physicianwas not considered important to the patient; onlyone third of the respondents were aware that herbscould interact with prescription medication. Re-gardless of whether patients plan to inform theirprovider about herb use or not, the onus is onproviders to ask the question of their patients. 36 This study presents the ndings of a survey and is subject to the limitations of self-reported data.Most of the survey items were value neutral. How-ever, undoubtedly the respondents would want toappear to be knowledgeable and may have mis-stated their actual herb use. In addition, becausethis survey was administered in health care clinics,the responses to items relating to physician com-munication may have over-represented the level ofcommunication between providers and patients. Approximately one fourth of the participants who answered the rst few pages of the survey didnot complete the last part. There are at least 2plausible reasons for the dropoff in response. Therespondents may have tired of answering the ques-tions and quit. Secondly, some questions in the lastpart dealt with their perspective of the physician'sattitude about herb use; thus, the respondents maynot have wanted to answer these questions for fearthat their responses may become known to theirphysician. Consequently, the proportion who feltthat their physician will not support their herb usemay actually be higher. Because this study surveyeda convenience sample of Hispanics, the responsesof these subjects may not be representative of thegeneral population of Hispanics in Indiana. Thosewho attend health clinics may be less likely to useherbs, thus the estimates of prevalence in this studymay be conservative. Primary care practitioners need to understand the extent and patterns of herbal use by their mul-tiethnic patients and efforts to elicit informationfrom patients about herbal use maybe warranted. 37 It is important to initiate and encourage open,honest discussion about their patients' interest in oruse of herbs. Assessments should start with a thor-ough drug history, which should include inquiryinto the use of dietary supplements including herbs.Pharmacists should strive to provide informationroutinely on the potential intrinsic effects and in-teractions of herbs with prescribed medications.Therefore, more continuing education programsand drug information resources about herbal med-ications must be made available to pharmacists asconsumer use continues to escalate. 38In addition, therapy guidelines should be clearly dened as in- 576JABFM November-December 2006 Vol. 19 No. 6 http://www.jabfm.org on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from creased knowledge of these adverse factors can help design safer pharmacologic and herbal regimens forindividual patients, thus minimizing adverse reac-tions and promoting good health. Lastly, physi-cians and consumers are encouraged to report sus-pected adverse effects of herbal products throughthe Food and Drug Administration Medwatchsystem (www.fda.gov or 1-800-FDA-1088) 4,9and available at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/ /H11011dms/ supplmnt.html. is an obligation of clinicians to elicit informa- tion on the use of herbs that may influence theirpatients' health and to provide information on safeand effective treatment options. It is paramount forclinicians to be aware of known or potential herb-drug interactions to adequately treat their patients.Both physicians and consumers must become moreeducated about the safe and effective use of herbs.Asking patients about supplement use during aninitial history should be made a central componentof patient care and medication use monitoring. 35 References 1.
