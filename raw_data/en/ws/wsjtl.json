Introduction Section 1942(a) of Title XIX, Part B, Subpart III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300x- 52(a)) requires the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), to determine the extent to which states1 have implemented the State P lan for the preceding fiscal year. Th e purpose of the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG) Annual Report is to provide information to assist the Secretary in making this determination. States are requir ed to prepare and submit an annual report that includes expenditur e summaries for (1) the s tate fiscal year (SFY) immediately preceding the federal fiscal year for which the state is applying for funds; and (2) the obligation and expenditure period of the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG) Notice of Award (NoA) subject to CSAT compliance review (Compliance Award), in the format provided in this guidance. The SABG Annual Report will address the purposes for which the SABG funds were expended, the SABG sub -recipients, and the authorized activities and services purchased with such funds. Particular attention should be given to the progress made toward accomplishing the goals and performanc e indicators identified in the s tates' a nd jurisdictions' plans. All s tates are required to prepare and submit t heir respective SABG Annual Reports utilizing SAMHSA's Web Block Grant Appl ication System (BGAS).

This may include a state or states that were previously considered \"designated states\" during any of the thr ee prior federal fiscal years for which a state was applying for a grant. See EI S/HIV policy change in SABG Annual Report instruction s SABG Table 5a - Primary Prevention Expenditures The s tate or jurisdiction must complete SABG Table 5a . There are six primary prevention strategies typically funded by principal agencies administering the SA BG. Expenditures within each of the six strategies or Institute of Medicine Model (IOM) should be directly associated with the cost of completing the activity or task. For example, information dissemination may include the cost of developing pamphlets, the time of participating staff and/or the cost of public service announcements, etc. If a state plans to use strategies not covered by these six categories or the state is unable to calculate expenditures by strategy, please report them under \"Other\" in Table 5a. The state or jurisdiction must complete SABG Table 5a Other Strategy if it chooses to report SUD primary prevention activities utilizing the IOM Model of Universal, Selective, and Indicated. Indicate how much funding supported each of the IOM cl assifications of Universal Direct, Universal Indirect , Selective, or Indicated without specifying the prevention strategy. Include all funding sources (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Block Grant, foundations). For detailed instructions, refer to those in the Block Grant Application System (BGAS). Section 1926 (Synar) - Tobacco: Costs associated with the Synar Program. Pursuant to the January 19, 1996 federal regulation \"Tobacco Regulation for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grants, Final Rule\" (45 CFR \u00a7 96.130) a state may not use the SABG to fund the enforcement of its statute, except that it may expend funds from its primary prevention set aside of its Block Grant allotment under 45 CFR \u00a7 96.124(b)(1) for carrying out the administrative aspects of the requirements, such as the development of the sample design and the conducting of the inspections. States should include any non-SABG funds* that were allotted for Synar activities in the appropriate columns under 7 below. Public Law 116-94, signed on December 20, 2019 supersedes this legislation and increased the minimum age for tobacco sales from 18 to 21. SAMHSA revised its guidance to clarify that the prevention set aside may be used to fund revisions to s tates' Synar program to comply with PL 116-94. These funds should be reported in the appropriate columns under 7 below. In most cases the total SABG amounts should equal the amounts reported on Plan Table 4, Row 2, Primary Substance Use Disorder Prevention. The one exception is if the state chooses to use a portion of the primary prevention set-aside to fund Non- Direct Services/System Development activities. The total on the Table 6 prevention column combined with the total on Table 5a should equal to expenditure Table 4, Row 2 in most instances. Institute of Medicine Classification: Universal, Selective, and Indicated: Prevention strategies may be classified using the IOM Model of Universal, Selective, and Indicated, which classifies preventive interventions by the population targeted. Definitions for these categories appear below: Universal : Activities targeted to the public or a whole population group that have not been identified based on individual risk. Universal Direct : Row 1 - Interventions directly serve an identifiable group of participants who have not been identified on the basis of individual risk (e.g., school curriculum, after-school program, parenting class). This also could include interventions involving int erpersonal and ongoing/repeated contact (e.g., coalitions). Universal Indirect : Row 2 - Interventions support population-based programs and environmental strategies (e.g., establishing, Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drugs ( ATOD) policies, modifying ATOD advertising practices). This also could include interventions involving programs and policies implemented by coalitions. Selective: Activities targeted to individuals or a subgroup of the population whose risk of developing a disorder is significantly higher than average. Indicated: Activities targeted to individuals in high -risk environments, identified as having minimal but detectable signs or symptoms foreshadowing disorder or having biological markers indicating predisposition for disorder but not meeting diagnostic levels (Adapted from The Institute of Medicine). States that can report on both the strategy type and the population served (universal, selective, or indicated) should do so. If planned expenditure information is only available by strategy type, then the state should report planned expenditures in the row titled Unspecified (for example, Information Dissemination Unspecified). Primary Substance Use Disorder Prevention Strategies Defined : Information Dissemination - This strategy provides knowledge and increases awareness of the nature and extent of alcohol and other drug use, abuse, and addiction, as well as their effects on individuals, families, and communities. It also provides knowledge and increases awareness of available prevention and treatment programs and services. It is characterized by one- way communication from the source to the audience, with limited contact between the two. Education - This strategy builds skills through structured learning processes. Critical life and social skills include decision making, peer resistance, coping with stress, problem solving, interpersonal communication, and systematic and judgmental abilities. There is more interaction between facilitators and participants than in the information strategy. Alternatives - This strategy provides participation in activities that exclude alcohol and other drugs. The purpose is to meet the needs filled by alcohol and other drugs with healthy activities and to discourage the use of alcohol and drugs through these activities. Problem Identification and Referral to Education - This strategy aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age -inappropriate us e of tobacco or alcohol and those individuals who have indulged in the first use of illicit drugs in order to assess if their behavior can be reversed through education. It should be noted, however, that this strategy does not incl ude any activity designed to determine if a person needs treatment. Community -based Process -This strategy provides ongoing networking activities and technical assistance to community groups or agencies. It encompasses neighborhood-based, grassroots empowerment models using action planning and collaborative systems planning. Environmental - This strategy establishes or changes written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes; thereby, influencing alcohol and other drug use by the general population. Other - States that plan their primary prevention expenditures using the IOM model of universal, selective, and indicated should use Table 5a to list their FFY 2022 and FFY 2023 SABG planned expenditures in each of these categories. -SABG Primary Prevention Expenditures SABG Table 5a State Identifier: Report Period From: To: Strategy A.

The purpose of the second table is to identify each special population the s tate or jurisdiction selected as a priority for p rimary prevention set -aside expenditures. Targeted Substances SABG Award Alcohol ? Tobacco ? Marijuana ? Prescription Drugs ? Cocaine ? Heroin ? Inhalants ? Methamphetamine ? Synthetic Drugs (i.e. Bath salts, Spice, K2) ? Targeted Populations SABG Award Students in College ? Military Families ? LGBTQ+ ? American Indians/Alaska Natives ? African American ? Hispanic ? Homeless ? Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders ? Asian ? Rural ? Other Underserved Racial and Ethnic Minorities ? OMB No. 0930- 0168 Categories for Expenditures for System Development/Non -Direct -Service Activities Expenditures in the following categories of activities may involve the time of s tate or sub -state personnel, or may be funded through contracts, grants, or agreements with other entities. Expenditures may come from the administrative funds and/or program funds (but may not include the HIV set -aside funds). Please utilize the following categories to describe the types of expenditures your state supports with Block Grant funds, and if the preponderance of the activity fits within a category. We understan d that a particular activity may cross categories but try to identify the primary purpose or goal of the activity. For example, a state may utilize B lock G rant funds to train personnel to conduct fidelity assessments of evidence- based practices. While th is could fall under either training/education and/or quality assurance/improvement - the primary purpose is to assure the implementation of evidence based practices (EBP), so that expenditure would most likely be captured under quality assurance/improvement. Information S ystems - This includes collecting and analyzing treatment data as well as prevention data under the SABG to monitor performance and outcomes. Costs for electronic health records and other health information technology also fall under this category. Infrastructure Support - This includes activities that provide the infrastructure to support services but for which there are no individual servi ces delivered. Examples include the development and maintenance of a crisis-response capacity, including hotlines, mobile crisis teams, web-based check -in groups (for medication, treatment, re- entry follow -up), drop- in centers, and respite services. Partnerships, Community Outreach, and N eeds Assessment - This includes s tate, regional, and local personnel salaries prorated for time and materials to support planning meetings, information collection, analysis, and travel. It also includes the support for partnerships across state and local agencies, and tribal governments. Community/network development activities, such as marketing, communication, and public education, and including the planning and coordination of services, fall into this category, as do needs- assessment projects to identify the scope and magnitude of the problem, resources available, gaps in services, and strategies to close those gaps.

Per the instructions, the standard SABG expenditures are for the state planned expenditure period of July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2023, for most states. 2 The expenditure period for The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) supplemental funding is September 1, 2021 - September 30, 2025, which is different from the expenditure period for the \"standard\" MHBG/SABG. Per the instructions, the planning period for standard MHBG/SABG expenditures is July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2023. 3 In FY 2020 SAMHSA modified the \"Level of Treatment,\" Reports, the LOC was entitled \"Opioid Replacement Therapy\" and the Type of Treatment Service/Setting included \"Opioid Replacement Therapy,\" Row 9 and \"ORT Outpatient,\" Row 10. The changes inadvertently created a barrier for data analysis as one-to -one mapping of the data submitted in the FY 2020 Table 10 to the data submitted in prior Reports is not possible. In the current and future SABG Reports, the LOC is \"OUD Medication Assisted Treatment\" and the Types of Treatment Service/Setting will include \"OUD Medication -Assisted Treatment Detoxification,\" Row 9 and \"OUD Medication Assisted Treatment Outpatient,\" Row 10. OUD Medication Assisted Treatment Detoxification includes hospital detoxification, residential detoxification, or ambulatory detoxification services/settings AND Opioid Medic ation -Assisted Treatm ent. OUD Medication Treatment Outpatient includes outpatient services/settings AND Opioid Medication -Assisted Treatment. The change was made to better align with language that reflects not all medications used to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) ar e opioid -based and more importantly convey that medications do not merely substitute one drug for another. -SABG Table 11a - Unduplicated Count of Persons Served for Alcohol and Other Drug Use This table provides an aggregate profile of the unduplicated number of admissions and persons for services funded through the SABG.

Please note that the correct reporting period for Tables 31 -34 is the Calendar Year (CY) which coincides with the reporting period for the pre- populated prevention NOMs in Tables 21 -30. We understand that some states have reported on the state fiscal year (SFY) or federal fiscal year (FFY) for these tables in past SABG Reports. If your state is unable to report on the calendar year, please indicate in this footnote why you are unable to report on the calendar year and the steps the state intends to take to make calendar year reporting possible in future years. Note that the correct reporting period for Table 35 is the SABG compliance period that coincides with the reporting period for Tables 4, 5a, 5b, 6 and 7. Rows 1 through 5 each correspond to a single form in the current year application among the following five tables: 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35. Column A: Enter the reporting period start date . Column B: Enter the reporting period end date . The date format to be entered in columns A and B should be month/day/year, as follows. Month: enter 2 digits (e.g. January = 01; December = 12) Day: enter 2 digits (e.g. 1st of the month = 01; 15th of the month = 15) 55 Year: enter all 4 digits (e.g. 2012, 2013) Reporting Period Start and End Dates for Information Reported on SABG Tables 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 Please indicate the reporting period for each of the following NOMS.

Question 2: Describe how your State's data collection and reporting processes record a participant's race, specifically for participants who are more than one race. Indicate whether the State added those participants to the number for each applicable racial category or whether the State added all those participants to the More Than One Race subcategory. 56 SABG Table 31 - P rimary Substance Use Disorder Prevention Individual -Based Programs and Strategies - Number of Persons Served by Age, Gender, Race, and Ethnicity Category Total A.
