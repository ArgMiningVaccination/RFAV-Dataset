Last updated on Nov 22, 2022. Clinical Overview Use Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects have been described for burdock whole root extract, as well as for its individual chemical constituents. Diabetes, CNS conditions, gastric ulcer, and colitis are under investigation for possible therapeutic use; however, not enough clinical evidence is available to recommend burdock for any condition. Dosing There is limited clinical evidence to guide burdock dosing. Dosages reported include 6 g/day of burdock root tea, and 12 g/day of a burdock fruit extract for advanced refractory pancreatic cancer. Burdock leaves have also been used and studied as non-stick bandages in wound care. Contraindications Contraindications have not yet been identified. Pregnancy/Lactation Avoid use. Documented adverse effects. Interactions None well documented. Burdock may enhance the hypoglycemic effect of hypoglycemia-associated agents. Adverse Reactions Allergic dermatitis and anaphylaxis have been reported. Toxicology Burdock is generally considered a safe and edible food product, but toxicology studies are lacking. Scientific Family - Asteraceae (daisy) Botany Burdock is native to Europe and northern Asia and is naturalized in the United States. Six species of the Arctium genus are recognized in the United States, including greater (A. lappa L.) and lesser (Arctium minus Bernh.) burdock. A synonym for burdock is L. major Gaertn. The plant is a perennial or biennial herb that grows up to 3 m (about 9 feet). It has large, ovate, acuminate leaves and broad pinkish flowers made up of reddish-violet tubular florets surrounded by many involucral bracts ending in a stiff, spiny, or hooked tip. The root pieces, used in teas, are hard, minimally fibrous, longitudinally wrinkled, and [USDA 2014](#USDA.2014) History Burdock has been recognized as a traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years, and its use as a detoxifying agent is documented in the Compendium of Materia Medica (1578). In traditional medicine, burdock fruits, seeds, roots, and leaves have been used as decoctions or teas for a wide variety of ailments, including colds, catarrh, gout, rheumatism, stomach ailments, and cancer, as well as use as a diuretic, diaphoretic, and laxative. It has also been promoted as an aphrodisiac and used topically for various skin problems. Burdock root is commonly used as food in Asia. Some US health stores carry fresh burdock root for sale as a [Duke 2003](#Duke.2003) Chemistry Burdock root yields a variety of compounds on analysis, including inulin (up to 50%), tannins, polyphenolic acids crystalline plant hormone, gamma-guanidino-n-butyric acid. A xyloglucan has been isolated and characterized from the 24% potassium hydroxide extract of edible burdock. Fructooligosaccharides have been determined as well. The leaves contain triterpenoids, while the root contains vitamins A, B1, B2, and C, as well as minerals including calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, sodium, zinc, and copper. Burdock seeds yield 15% to 30% fixed oils, a bitter glycoside arctiin, 2 lignans (lappaol A and B), chlorogenic acid, and a germacranolide. Other studies have isolated from burdock fruit constituents, the fruit pulp (pomace), which contains 11% proteins, 19% lipids, and 34% [Jaiswal 2011](#21773587), [Lou 2012](#22284874) Uses and Pharmacology Anti-inflammatory Animal data In vitro and animal studies have attempted to elucidate a mechanism of action for the anti-inflammatory effect of burdock. Inhibition of proinflammatory mediators and antioxidant action, and suppression of nitric oxide production have been demonstrated.( [Chan 2011](#20981575)) Chemical constituents thought to be responsible for this activity include lappaol a small randomized controlled trial (n=36) investigating burdock on inflammatory markers showed a significant improvement compared to baseline (but not compared to placebo) in serum interleukin (IL-6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein in older adults with knee osteoarthritis who consumed 6 g/day of burdock root tea for 6 weeks (P=0.002 and P=0.003, respectively). No harmful effects were observed.( [Maghsoumi-Norouzabad 2016](#25350500)) The American College of Rheumatology's guidelines (2012) on the management of gout listed burdock as an inappropriate complementary therapy for treatment of a short-term attack of gout. The new guideline (2020) based on additional evidence regarding the management of gout no longer included a statement regarding the use of burdock.( [Fitzgerald 2020](#32391934), [Khanna 2012](#23024029)) Antimicrobial In vitro data In vitro studies report activity of burdock extracts against human pathogens, including bacteria (eg, Bacillus subtilis, trial (n=36) investigated the effect of burdock on oxidative stress indicators in older adults with knee osteoarthritis. After 6 weeks of burdock root tea (6 g/day), a significant improvement was documented compared to baseline in malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase (P=0.009), Additionally, significant improvements were seen with burdock tea compared to controls in glutathione (P=0.003), malondialdehyde (P=0.021), and total antioxidant capacity (P=0.004). No effects were seen.( [Maghsoumi-Norouzabad 2016](#25350500)) Aphrodisiac Animal data Burdock has been used as a natural aphrodisiac. However, an experiment in rats found less enhancement of male sexual behavior than with the comparator, sildenafil, but increased serum testosterone levels.( [JianFeng 2012](#22296876)) Cancer Animal data The root, leaves, dried fruit, arctigenin, and lappaol have been evaluated for activity against human cancer cell lines. Elucidated mechanisms of action include induction of apoptosis, intracellular adenosine triphosphate depletion, interference with signaling pathways, and direct action on tyrosinase and melanin. Limited experiments have been conducted in animals, with lappaol inhibiting tumor growth in mice in pancreatic cancer refractory to gemcitabine were enrolled in a phase I, open-label, single-arm study (n=15) to determine the maximum tolerable dose of GBS-01, a burdock fruit extract. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed at any of the 3 doses tested (3, 7.5, and 12 g/day) and adverse events were extremely mild. After this 28-day intervention, the recommended dose of GBS-01 was determined to be 12 g/day (approximately 4 g burdock fruit extract). Of the 15 patients, 1 exhibited a partial response and 4 had stable disease. The response rate and disease control rate were deemed to be 6.7% and 33.3%, respectively, whereas the median progression-free and overall survival times were 1.1 months and 5.7 months, respectively.( [Ikeda 2016](#27685612)) CNS Animal data In a rodent model of brain injury due to ischemia, arctigenin suppressed microglial activation; reduced interleukin and tumor necrosis factor expression, resulting in a lower neural deficit score; and decreased infarct volume when compared with no intervention.( [Fan 2012](#22972486)) Inhibition of beta-amyloid production, decreased senile plaques, and decreased memory impairment was shown in mice administered arctigenin. The mechanism of action proposed by the researchers includes suppression of enzymes and signaling pathways.( [Zhu 2013](#23926267)) Dermatology In vitro data Whole root extract restored canine dermal fibroblast integrity following peroxide damage in 1 experiment.( [Pomari 2013](#24192279)) Clinical data An uncontrolled observational interventional study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of a homeopathic preparation of Lappa (Arctium lappa) in the treatment of acne vulgaris in young adults. The 34 participants were treated with Lappa 6c for 7 days followed by placebo, the regimen was repeated if recurrence occurred. By the end of the 6-month follow-up, significant improvements were reported in total lesion count, types of lesions, and quality of life scores (P<0.001 each). Patients with a negative family history responded better (P<0.002) as did those who were ambithermal or chilly compared to those whose thermal reaction was hot (P<0.041).( [Miglani 2014](#24931753)) Diabetes Animal data Experiments have been conducted in mice and rats. Proposed mechanisms of action include an inhibitory effect on alpha-glucosidase by sitosterol and an effect by inulin on plasma glucose levels.( [Chan 2011](#20981575)) Other arctiin, arctignan) and individual stimulation of insulin secretion, enhanced regeneration 2014](#24269245)) An experiment, however, found a lack of effect of burdock in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model.( [Swanston-Flatt 1989](#2743711)) In addition, in rats with induced diabetic nephropathy, arctiin reduced albinuria and glomerular filtration damage, as evaluated by histology.( [Ma 2013](#23147865)) Following a study examining arctigenin's effect on increased physical endurance and time to fatigue in mice, a role in diabetes was postulated,( [Tang 2011](#21887385)) while positive effects on cholesterol efflux suggest the chemical may contribute to managing associated hyperlipidemia.( [Xu 2013](#24140409)) Clinical data A 1999 clinical study on traditional Chinese medicine found a \"satisfactory\" reduction in hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes with burdock.( [Xu 2014](#24269245)) GI tract Animal data In rodents, arctigenin and the lactone onopordopicrin have been shown to reduce the extent of induced colitis.( [de Almeida 2013](#23313393), [Hyam 2013](#23375938)) Onopordopicrin extracted from A. lappa leaves has also been evaluated for its antisecretory effect on gastrin in gastric ulcers and induced lesions in rat studies. In these studies, an increase in somatotropin was documented with no increase in mucus production. Histological examination of tissues showed a decrease in the size of gastric lesions and enhanced regeneration of tissues.( [da Silva 2013](#23036453), [de Almeida 2012](#22191571)) Clinical data There are no clinical data regarding the use of burdock for gastric ulcers or colitis, despite its use for these conditions in traditional medicine. Gout Clinical data The American College of Rheumatology guidelines on the management of gout (2012) voted that the use of various oral complementary agents, including burdock, was inappropriate for the treatment of an acute attack of gout.( [Khanna 2012](#23024029)) Metabolic effects Clinical data A number of metabolic risk factors were shown to be reduced when burdock root extract was combined with aquatic exercise for 16 weeks. In elderly women with metabolic syndrome, the effect of burdock root extract on body composition and serum sex hormones was investigated in South Korea in a small double-blind, randomized, controlled trial (N=24). Intervention groups were burdock root extract (300 mL/day) or aquatic exercise alone and in combination. The control group parameters were undefined except that they were encouraged to maintain their usual lifestyle. Compared to controls, aquatic exercise alone and combined with burdock root extract significantly reduced waist circumference (P=0.005 and P=0.007, respectively) as well as increased serum testosterone and P=0.025, respectively) respectively). Meanwhile, burdock root extract (P=0.011) or aquatic exercise alone (P=0.002), but not exercise plus extract, resulted in significantly greater increases in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) compared to controls. Significant correlations were found between changes in sex hormones and body composition parameters, such that changes in testosterone were positively correlated with changes in lean body mass and skeletal muscle mass, and negatively correlated with changes in percent body fat, percent abdominal fat, and waist circumference. Additionally, a change in SHBG was negatively correlated with changes in percent body fat. No correlations were found between changes in estradiol or DHEA-S levels and body composition parameters. No other intergroup comparisons, such as between burdock root extract with and without aquatic exercise, were reported.( [Ha 2021](#33664334)) Wound dressing/bandage Clinical data Burdock leaves have historically been used by the Amish and other cultures as a non-stick bandage for burns (less than 25% of body surface area) and other wounds in order to reduce the need for analgesics during dressing changes. The use of burdock leaves as a bandage was evaluated in a prospective case series pilot study within a community-based participatory research framework. A total of 5 Amish patients were enrolled who ranged in age from 3 to 56 years and presented with first- and second-degree burns that covered 1.5% to 4% of their bodies. The leaves were wild-crafted, first-year growth. An herbal burn and wound ointment was applied to the wound, which was then wrapped in a layer of burdock leaves. The average treatment duration was 8.2 days, whereas the mean healing time was 13.8 days (range, 5 to 23 days) with only 1 of the 5 participants using analgesics. None of the burn wounds became infected.( [Amish Burn Study Group 2014](#24668061)) Other uses Older reports exist for the use of burdock in the treatment of urolithiasis( [Grases 1994](#7860196)) and for antagonism of platelet activating factor.( [Iwakami 1992](#1394633)) Dosing There is limited clinical evidence to guide burdock dosing. Dosages reported include 6 g/day of [Maghsoumi-Norouzabad 2016](#25350500) A 28-day phase dose-determination trial conducted in patients with advanced refractory pancreatic cancer recommended 12 g/day.
