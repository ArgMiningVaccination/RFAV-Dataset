What Clients Say United States Mental Health Experts Over the years, I've tried nearly a dozen therapists. Meeting with Yakov was different than any of them. I could never get anything past him and he always seemed to understand what was going on for me in a way that no one else did. From my work with Yakov, I am finally now able to trust myself and feel connected to my body in a way that I never was before. Daniel I am so grateful to Mordecai for creating a safe space for my son. My son really enjoys meeting with him and has been doing so much better since they started meeting. Sarah Etty clearly has an expert grasp on the nature of eating disorders. She had a wealth of knowledge and experience that I benefited from. I'm very happy I met with her. "}
