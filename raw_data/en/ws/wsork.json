Opinion concurring -in-part and dissenting -in-part filed by Circuit Judge REYNA . MOORE , Circuit Judge . Natural Alternatives International, Inc., appeals a de- cision of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California granting Creative Compounds, LLC's motion for judgment on the pleadings that the asserted claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,965,5 96, 7,825,084, 7,504,376, 8,993,610, 8,470,86 5, and RE45,947 are not patent eligible. Because Creative Compounds has failed to demonstrate under Natural Alternatives' proposed claim construction s that the claims are not patent eligible, we reverse and re- mand. BACKGROUND Natural Alternatives owns a n umber of patents that re- late to dietary supplements containing beta -alanine and have substa ntially similar specification s. Beta -alanine is NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 3 an amino acid. Together with histidine, another amino acid, it can form dipeptides that are found in muscles. E.g. , '596 patent 1:59- 64. The dipeptides are involved in the regulation of intra -cellular pH during muscle contraction and development of fatigue, and variations in dipeptide concentrations affect the anaerobic work capacity of indi-vidual athletes. Id. at 4:58-62, 5:1- 3. O ne of these dipep- tides is carnosine, which contributes to hydronium ion buffering. Id. at 2:11 During certain sustained exer- cise, hydronium ions and lactate can accumulate reduce intracellular pH. Id. at 1:50 -54. The reduced pH interferes with the creatine -phosphorylcrea- tine system, a part of the process by which energy is gener- ated in cells, particularly muscle cells. Id. at 1:31 -43, 1:54-55. The claimed patents generally relat e to the use of beta- alanine in a dieta ry supplement to \"increas[e] the an- aerobic working capacity of muscle and other tissue.\" Id. at 2:16- 18. Natural Alternatives has asserted its patents in multi- ple suits in the Southern District of California. Creative Compounds moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the district court granted. Applying the two -part test from Alice Corp. P arty Ltd. v. CLS Bank International , 573 U.S. 208, 217 (2014) , it held all of the asserted claims were di- rected to patent ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 and lacked an inventive concept sufficient to render them patent eligible . The district court granted judgment in favor of Creative Compounds, and Natural Alternatives timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1). L EGAL STANDARDS Section 101 of the Patent Act provides that \"[w] hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the condit ions and requirements of this title. \" NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 4 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The term \"process\" \" includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material. \" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 100(b). The Supreme Court has explained that under \u00a7 101, patent protection does not extend to the patent ineligible concepts of laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas, which are \"building blocks of human in genuity .\" Alice, 573 U.S. at 216-17. We must therefore distinguish between claims to patent ineligi ble subject matter and those that \"integrate the building blocks into something more.\" Id. at 217. In doing so, we first determine whether the claims at issue are \" directed to\" a patent ineligible concept. Id. As the Supreme Court has cautioned, we must be careful in this analysis as \"too broad an interpretation of this exclu- sionary principle could eviscerate patent law. For all in- ventions at some level embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas.\" May o Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 71 (2012) . If we determine that the claims are directed to a patent ineligible concept , \"we con- sider the elements of each claim both individually and 'as an ordered combination' to determine whether additional elements 'transform the nature of the claim' into a patent - eligible application,\" i.e., whether there is an \"inventive concept.\" Al ice, 573 U.S. at 217 ( quoting Mayo , 566 U.S. at 78-79). Eligibility under \u00a7 101 is a question of law based on un- derlying facts that, ultimately, we review de novo. SAP Am. v. InvestPic, LLC , 898 F.3d 1161, 1166 (Fed. Cir. 2018). It may be resolved on a m otion to dismiss where \"there are no factual allegations that, taken as true, pre-vent resolving the eligibility question as a matter of law.\" Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc. , 882 F.3d 1121, 1125 (Fed. Cir. 2018). NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 5 DISCUSSION The district court held that the claims at issue are not patent eligible and dismissed . We review a district court's Rule 12(c) dismissal for judgment on the pleadings under the law of the regional circuit. Amdocs (Isr. ) Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc. , 841 F.3d 1288, 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The Ninth Circuit reviews a court's grant of judgment on the pleadings de novo. Newton v. Parker Drilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. , 881 F.3d is \"functionally identical\" to the s tandard for deciding a motion to dismiss. Cafasso v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc., 637 F.3d 1047, 1055 n.4 (9th Cir Inc. , 867 F.2d 1188, 1192 (9th Cir. 1989)). In doing so, the court \"inquire[s] whether the complaint's factual allegations, together with all reasona- ble inferences, state a plausible claim for relief.\" Id. at 1055. In the Ninth Circuit, a court deciding a motion under Rule 12 may consider \"material which is properly submit- ted as part of the compla int,\" including documents that are not physically attached to the complaint , if their authentic- ity is not contested and the complaint necessarily relies on them, and it may take judicial notice of matters of public record. See Lee v. City of L.A. , 250 F.3 d 668, 688 -89 (9th Cir. 2001). The district court stated that in performing its eligibil- ity analysis, it accepted Natural Alternative s' proposed claim constructions. J.A. 7 n.3. This was proper given the stage of the litigation . Applying the proposed claim con- structions, we hold that the complaint's factual allegations, together with all reasonable inferences, plausibly establish the eligibility of the representative claims . 1 1 Though the dissent suggests disagreement with those constructions , we note that n either party argued for NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 6 I. Several of the asserted patents claim methods of treat- ment using beta -alanin e (\"the Method Claims\"). C laim 1 of the '596 patent and claim 1 of the '865 patent have been treated as representative of the claims in those patents. Claim 1 of the '596 patent recites: a different construct ion on appeal. The dissent's primary criticism is that the \"effective\" limitation \"is not disclosed in the plain language of the claims and is only present by virtue of the proposed claim construction.\" Dissent at 5. Respectfully, this is not factually accurate as nearly all of the claims of four of the patents at issue contain express limitations requiring effectiveness. See '865 patent 22:56 - 23:29 (all claims requir e the amount administered be \"ef- fective to increase beta -alanylhistidine dipeptide synthesis '596 patent 14:66- 15:6 (all claims requir e the amount administered be \"effective to increase beta - alanylhistidine dipeptide synthesis in \"); '084 pa- 23:1- 24:3 (claims 13 -14 and 16- 18 requir e the claimed method \" increase beta -alanylhistidine dipep- tide synthesis in a tissue\" and \"the anaerobic of the '610 22:24- 23:5 \"increase [] beta- alanyl histidine levels in muscle tissue sufficient to delay the on-set of fatigue in the human\"). The dissent also suggest s the \"dietary supplement\" limitation may not be a limitation be- cause it only appears in the prea mble of the claims. Dis- sent at 6. Again, that is not correct with regard to the claims at issue, many of which expressly include the die-tary supplement limitation in the body. See '865 patent 22:56- (all claims); '610 patent the \"dietary supplement\" lan- guage in the preamble provides a clear antecedent basis for language in the body of the claims. See '084 patent 22:25- 38 (claims 1 -4). NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 7 1. A method of regulating hydronium ion concen- trations in a human tissue comprising: providing an amount of beta -alanine to blood or blood plasma effective to increase beta- alanylhisti- dine dipeptide synthesis in the human tissue; and exposing the tissue to the blood or blood plasma, whereby the concentration of beta -alanylhistidine is increased in the human tissue. Claim 1 of the '865 patent recites: 1. A method of increasing anaerobic working capac- ity in a human subject, the method comprising: a) providing to the human subject an amount of an amino acid to blood or blood plasma effective to in- crease beta- alanylhistidine dipeptide synthesis in the tissue, wherein said amino acid is at least one of: i) beta -alanine that is not part of a dipep- tide, polypeptide or oligopeptide; ii) an ester of beta -alanine that is not p art of a dipeptide, polypeptide or oligopeptide; or iii) an amide of beta -alanine that is not part of a dipeptide, polypeptide or oligopeptide; and b) exposing the tissue to the blood or blood plasma, whereby the concentration of beta -alanylhistidine is increased in the tissue, wherein the amino acid is provided through a die- tary supplement . Natural Alternatives' proposed construction of the \"effec- tive\" limitations is to \"elevates beta -alanine above natural NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 8 levels to cause an increase in the synthesis of beta -alanyl- histidine dipeptide in the \"dietary supplement\" as \"an addition to the human diet, which is not a natural or conventional food, which effec- tively increases athletic performance when administered to the human over a period of time.\" J.A . 581. It also defines \"increasing anaerobic working capacity\" as \"increasing the amount of work performed by a muscle under lactate pro-ducing conditions.\" J.A. 580. The district court held both claims are directed to nat- ural laws. It held claim 1 of the '865 patent is directed to the natural law that \"ingesting certain levels of beta -ala- nine, a natural substance, will increase the carnosine con- centration in human tissue and, thereby, increa se the anaerobic working capacity in a human.\" J.A. 22. It held claim 1 of the '596 patent is directed to the natural law that \"ingesting certain levels of beta -alanine, a natural sub- stance, will increase the carnosine concentration in human tissue and, thereby, aid in regulating hydronium ion con-centration in the tissue. \" J.A. 21. We do not agree. Administering certain quantities of beta -alanine to a human subject alters that subject's natural state. Specifi- cally, homeostasis is overcome, and the subj ect's body will produce greater levels of creatine. See '596 patent 5:27- 35. This, in turn, results in specific physiological benefits for athletes engaged in certain intensive exercise. See '596 pa- tent 5:21 -23. The claims not only embody this discovery, they require that an infringer actually administer the dos-age form claimed in the manner claimed, altering the ath-lete's physiology to provide the described benefits. These are treatment claims and as such they are patent eligible. As we explained in Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. West -Ward Pharmaceuticals International Ltd. , 887 F.3d 1117, 1134 -36 (Fed. Cir. 2018), claims that are directed to particular methods of tre atment are patent eligible. The claims in Vanda involved a method of treating patients NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 9 with schizophrenia that first required performing a genetic test to determine if a patient was a CYPD2D6 performer. Id. at 1121. Based on the results of that test, a particular dose of iloperidone was selected and i nternally adminis- tered. Id. As a result, the risk of QTc prolongation, a dan- gerous side effect , was decreased . Id. at 1121 & n.2. We held that the claims were not directed to a natural relation- ship between iloperidone, CYP2D6 metabolism, and QT c prolon gation. Id. at 1134. While we acknowledged that the inventors had recognized the underlying relationships, we explained that those were not what was claimed. Id. at 1135. Instead , the claims were directed to a patent -eligible method of using iloperidone to treat schizophrenia , \"a spe- cific method of treatment for specific patients using a spe- cific compound at specific doses to achieve a specific outcome.\" Id. at 1136. Unlike the claims held ineligible in Mayo , which re- quired only the observation of a natural law, the Vanda claims required a doctor to affirmatively administer a drug to alter a patient's condition from their natural state. Id. at 1135. In Mayo , the discovery underlying the claims was that when blood levels were above a certai n level harmful effects were more likely and when they were below another level the drug's beneficial effects w ere lost. Nothing in the claim required any application of that discovery beyond the \"steps that must be taken in order to apply the laws in question .\" Mayo , 566 U.S. at 82. The claims at issue in Mayo involved administering a prior art drug to a subject and determining the level of drug metabolite in that sub-ject. Id. at 74 -75. The claims further provided that partic- ular levels of measured metabolite indicated a need to increase or decrease the amount of drug subsequently ad- ministered to the subject. Id. at 75. The claims did not, however, require any actual action be taken based on the measured level of metabolite. Id. at 75 -76. The claim, therefore, \"was not a treatment claim,\" because \"it was 'not limited to instances in which the doctor actually decreases NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 10 (or increases) the dosage level.'\" Vanda, 887 F.3d at 11 36 (quoting Mayo , 566 U.S. at 76). This was expressly recog- nized in Mayo , which distinguished the Mayo claim from \"a typical patent on a new drug or a new way of using an ex- isting drug ,\" because the Mayo claim did not \"confine [its] reach to particular applications\" of the natural laws relied upon. 566 U.S. at 87 (emphasis added). Such claims rely on the relationship between the administration of the drug and the physiological effects in the patient. The fact that the human body responds to the treatment through bio- chemical processes does not convert the claim into an inel- igible one. As we explained in Rapid Litigation Management Ltd. v. CellzDirect , Inc. , 827 F.3d 1042, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2016), the \"natural abili ty of the subject matter to undergo the process does not make the claim 'directed to' that natural ability.\" The Method Claims are directed to patent eligible new ways of using an existing product , beta -alanine , they are treatment claims . This falls cle arly within the scope of \u00a7 101, which allows for patents on \"any new and useful pro- cess,\" including \"a new use of a known . . composition of matter, or material.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 100(b), 101. As the Su- preme Court explained in Mayo , such patents on a new use of an existing drug are \"typical.\" 566 U.S. at 87. While the Method Claims have similarities to the claims found ineligible in Mayo, as they utilize an underly- ing natural law, this is not sufficient to establish that they are directed to that law. In Mayo , the Court held the claims did not do significantly more than simply describe the nat- ural \"relationships between concentrations of certain me- tabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a thiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause h arm.\" Id. at 77. The Method Claims similarly rely on the relation- ships between the administration of beta -alanine and beta- alanylhistidine dipeptide synthesis, but under Natural Al- ternatives' constructions, the Method Claims require spe- cific steps be tak en in order to bring about a change in a NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 11 subject, altering the subject's natural state. Unlike the claims in Mayo , the Method Claims at issue are treatment claims. Like the claims in Vanda, the Method Claims contain specific elements that clearly establish they are doing more than simply reciting a natural law. Like the Vanda claims, which specify a patient population to be treated, the Method Claims specify particular results to be obtained by practicing the method. Claim 1 of the '596 patent is di- recte d to a \"method of regulating hydronium ion concentra- tions in a human ti ssue,\" and claim 1 of the '865 patent is directed to a \" method of increasing anaerobic working ca- pacity in a human subject .\" Similarly, both the Vanda claims and the Method Claims specify a compound to be administered to achieve the claimed result. Claim 1 of the '596 patent achieves the result through the administration of the specific compound beta- alanine , and claim 1 of the '865 patent requires use of one of the three specified forms of beta -alanine. The claims in Vanda further specified the dosages of the compound to be administer ed. The M ethod Claims likewise contain a dosage limitation by virtue of the \"effective\" limitation. As we looked to th e specification in Vanda to determine the significance of the dosing ranges, 887 F.3d at 1135, here, the specification provides a method for calculating dosage based on a subject's weight, '596 pa-tent 5:48 -50. This goes far beyond merely stating a law of nature , and instead sets forth a particular method of treat- ment . Similarly, t he fact that the active ingredient in the sup- plement is a molecule that occurs in nature and is con- sumed as part of the human diet also does not alter our analysis. 2 Creative Com pounds argue s that, if it were dis- covered that beta -alanine or another natural compound 2 The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has adopted NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 12 can be used to treat or cure Alzheimer's or some other dis- ease, the method for doing so would not be patent eligible. Appellee Br. 28 -29; Oral Arg. at 15:10- 35. That is not the case before us. That flies in the face of the Patent Act, which expressly permit s patenting a new use of an existing product. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 100(b), 101. The Supreme Court has also rejected the idea that claims to methods making use of natural products are equivalent to claims to the natural products themselves. See Ass'n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. , 569 U.S. 576, 595 (2013) (distin- guishing between method claims for manipulating genes and claims to the genes); Funk Br others Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co. , 333 U.S. 127, 130 (1948) (\"We do not have presented the question whether the methods of selecting and testing the non- inhibitive strains are patentable. We have here only product claims.\"). Moreover, while beta -al- anine may exist in nature, Natural Alternatives has ar- gued that the quantities being administered do not , and that the claimed consumption greatly exceeds natural lev- els. See J.A. 580-81 (providing a construction of the \"effec- tive\" limitation in each of the Method Claims to mean guidance on how ex aminers should determine whether a claim is eligible under \u00a7 101 and provided examples of eli- gible and ineligible claims. Under these guidelines, a claim to a practical application of a natural product to treat a particular disease is patent eligible. Th e parties dispute the persuasiveness of this document and the weight we should afford it under Skidmore v. Swift & Co. , 323 U.S. 134 (1944). The issue before us is a matter of law and the result is clear, thus this is not a case in which Skidmore deferenc e would affect the outcome. NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 13 \"elevates beta -alanine above natural levels to cause an in- crease in the synthesis of beta -alanylhistidine in the tis- sue\" (emphasis added)).3 The Method Claims at issue are treatment claims. They cover using a natural product in unnatural quantities to alter a patient's natural state, to treat a patient with specific dosages outlined in the patents. We hold, there-fore, that the Method Claims are not directed to i neligible subject matter. Moreover, at step two, factual impediments exist to re- solving the case at this stage. Cl aim 1 of the '865 patent requires \"the amino acid is provided through a dietary sup- plement ,\" with the dietary supplement limitation con- strued as \"an addition to the human diet, which is not a natural or conventional food.\" J.A. 581 (emphasis added). Creative Compounds argues that the \"inventors admitted in the '865 patent, and all of the patents -on-appeal, that placing a natural substance int o a dietary supplement for administration to a human, in order to increase the func-tion of tissues is a conventional, well -known activity .\" Ap- pellee Br. 37 (citing '865 patent 1:41- 44). The language it cites, however, does not stand for that proposition. In- stead, the patent states \"[n]atural food supplements are typically designed to compensate for reduced levels of nu- trients in the modern human and animal diet. In particu- lar, useful supplements increase the function of tissues when consumed.\" '865 pat ent 1:41- 44. At most, this lan- guage shows that the prior art contained food supplements containing natural products, and typically those were used to compensate for reduced levels of nutrients. It does not establish that the dietary supplement in the claims, which 3 Indeed , the record contains an expert declaration stating that \"one 3.2 gram daily supplement of beta -ala- nine is the equivalent to eating at least 109 Big Macs per day.\" J.A. 914. NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 14 provides a dose well in excess of the normal levels of beta - alanine, would have been well -understood, routine, and conventional . While a fact -finder may ultimately deter- mine that the dietary supplement limitation was well- un- derstood, routine, and conventiona l, absent a clear statement to that effect in the specification, complaint, or other material properly before the court, when disputed such a determination may not be made on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Under Natural Alternatives' proposed claim construc- tions, the Method Claims are not directed to an exception to \u00a7 101 under the first step of the Alice test. Therefore, judgment on the pleadings was inappropriate. II. The district court also considered the patent eligibility of a number of cla ims to dietary supplements (\"the Product Claims\"). The parties and the district court treated claim 6 of the '376 patent and claim 1 of the '084 patent as repre- sentative of the claims in those patents. C laim 6 of the '376 patent depends on claims 1 and 5 . In its opinion, the dis- trict court also held representative claim 34 of the '947 pa- tent ineligible. Representative claim 34 of the '947 patent recites : 34. A human dietary supplement for increasing hu-man muscle tissue strength comprising a mixture of creatine, a carbohydrate and free amino acid beta- alanine that is not part of a dipeptide, poly- peptide or an oligopeptide, wherein the human di-etary supplement does not contain a free amino acid L -histidine, wherein the free amino acid beta - alanine is in a n amount that is from 0.4 g to 16.0 g per daily dose, wherein the amount increases the muscle tissue strength in the human, and wherein the human dietary supplement is formulated for one or more doses per day for at least 14 days. NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 15 Although Natural Alternatives argued that claim 34 is eli- gible as it is a treatment claim with a very specific dosing regimen contained within the claim itself, at oral argument Natural Alternatives acknowledged that this patent was not asserted against Cr eative Compounds. Oral Arg. 0:52 - 1:20. Though rendered ineligible in the same district court opinion as the other patents at issue in this appeal, t he '947 patent was not asserted against Creative Compounds.4 Claims not asserted in this litigation against this appellee, Creative Compounds, are not properly before this court in this appeal. This does not prejudice the patentee's ability to defend the eligibility of the '947 patent in future proceed-ings. Turning to the Product Claims before us, c laim 6 of the '376 patent depends on claims 1 and 5. 1. A composition, comprising: glycine ; and a) an amino acid selected from the group consisting of a beta -alanine, an ester of a beta- alanine, and an amide of a beta- ala- nine, or b) a di -peptide selected from the group con- sisting of a beta -alanine di- peptide and a beta- alanylhistidine di- peptide. 5. The composition of claim 1, wherein the compo-sition is a dietary supplement or a sports drink. 4 The ' 947 patent was asserted in a related litigation against Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. At the time of oral argument, that case was stayed. That case against th at defendant is not part of the present appeal. NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 16 6. The composition of claim 5, wherein the dietary supplement or sports drink is a supplement for hu- mans. Claim 1 of the '084 patent recites: 1. A human dietary supplement , comprising a beta - alanine in a unit dosage of between about 0.4 grams to 16 grams, wherein the supplement pro- vides a unit dosage of beta -alanine. Natural A lternatives proposed construing \"dietary supplement\" in the '084 patent to mean \"an addition to the human diet, which is not a natural or conventional food, which effec-tively increases athletic performance and is manufactured to be used over a period of time.\" J.A. 572, 574. The district court held that the Product Claims are di- rected to ineligible subject matter. It held claim 6 of the '376 patent is directed to the natural phenom ena of beta - alanine and g lycine and claim 1 of the '084 patent is di- rected to the natural phenomenon of beta -alanine . We do not agree. Although beta -alanine is a natural product, the Prod- uct Claims are not directed to beta -alanine. A claim to a manufacture or com position of matter made from a natural product is not directed to the natural product where it has different characteristics and \" the potential for significant utility. \" See Diamond v. Chakrabarty , 447 U.S. 303, 310 (1980). Just as the Method Claims are directed to specific methods of treatment that employ a natural law, the Prod-uct Claims are directed to specific treatment formulations that incorporate natural products , but they have different characteristics and can be used in a manner that beta -ala- nine as it appea rs in nature cannot . In the Product Claims, beta -alanine and glycine are in- corporated into particular dosage form s. Claim 6 of the '376 patent is directed to a \"dietary supplement or sports NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 17 drink\" that uses a combination of glycine and one of the specified forms of beta -alanine. Under Natural Alterna- tives' claim constructions, the quantity of beta -alanine must be sufficient to \"effectively increase[] athletic perfor-mance,\" and the specification provides a method for deter- mining such an amount. Si milarly, the \"dietary supplement\" in claim 1 of the '084 patent uses the product beta- alanine at a dosage of \"between about 0.4 grams to 16 grams \" to \"effectively increase[] athletic performance.\" In each case , the natural products have been isolated and then incorporated into a dosage form with particular char- acteristics . At this stage in the litigation, it has been suf- ficiently alleged that these characteristics provide significant utility , as the claimed dosage forms can be used to increase athletic pe rformance in a way that naturally occurring beta -alanine cannot. Accordingly, neither claim is directed to ineligible subject matter. Moreover, even though claim 6 contains a combination of glycine and beta -alanine, both of which are natural prod- ucts, tha t is not necessarily sufficient to establish that the claimed combination is \"directed to \" ineligible subject mat- ter. The Court's decision in Funk Brothers does not stand for the proposition that any combination of ineligible sub- ject matter is itself inel igible. In Funk Brothers, the Court held that claims to a mixture of two naturally occurring bacteria were not patent eligible where each bacteria spe- cies in the claimed combination \"ha[d] the same effect it always had,\" and the \"combination of species produce[d] . . . no enlargement of the range of their utility.\" 333 U.S. at 131. The combination of the bacteria into the same pack-age did \"not improve in any way their natural function.\" Id. Here, as Creative Compounds ' counsel acknowledged at oral ar gument, the record indicates that the claimed combination of glycine and beta -alanine could have syner- gistic effects allowing for outcomes that the individual com- ponents could not have. Oral Arg. 24:45 -51, ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 18 Given that this is the pleading sta ge, w e would have to ac- cept this statement as true even if it were just an allegation in the pleadings. Instead, what we have goes far beyond that, including a statement in an article attached to an ex- pert report explaining that \"one of insulin's effects is to in-crease amino acid (such as beta -alanine ) into our cells,\" J.A. 1063, a statement in the specification that \"[i]t may be that glycine enhances insulin sensitivity,\" ' 376 patent at 6:3-5, and an expert declaration explaining that direct sup- plementati on of a different amino acid had no effect unless \"co-supplemented with glucose or other compounds in- creasing the concentration of insulin in circulation,\" J.A. 1132. All of these suggest that when combined the beta- alanine and glycine have effects that a re greater than the sum of the parts. At a minimum, there are sufficient factual allegations to render judgment on the pleadings in- appropriate. Accordingly, given the factual allegations , these claims would still survive a motion for judgment on the plea dings at the first step of the Alice test. Finally, e ven if the Product Claims were directed to in- eligible subject matter, judgment on the pleadings would still be inappropriate under step two . Like claim 1 of the '865 patent, the Product Claims contain a dietary supple- ment limitation , with the same proposed construction . See J.A. 572, 574. As we explained with regard to the Method Claims, the specification does not contain language sup- porting the idea that this limitation was well- understood, routine, and conventional . The language in the specifica- tion does not support this proposition, and patentee's claim construction contradicts Creative Compound s' position , so such a determination may not be made on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. III. The parties and the district court have treated claim 1 of the '610 patent as representative of the claims in that patent (\"the Manufacturing Claims\") . It recites: NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 19 1. Use of beta -alanine in manufacturing a human dietary supplement for oral consumption; suppl ying the beta -alanine, which is not part of a dipeptide, polypeptide or oligopeptide, as a single ingredient in a manufacturing step of the human dietary supplement or mixing the beta -alanine, which is not part of a di- peptide, polypeptide or oligopeptide, in combina-tion with at least one other ingredient for the manufacture of the human dietary supplement , whereby the manufactured human dietary supple-ment is for oral consumption of the human dietary supplement in doses over a period of time increases beta-a lanyl histidine levels in muscle tissue suffi- cient to delay the onset of fatigue in the human. Natural Alternatives proposed construing \"[u]se of beta -al- anine in manufacturing a human dietary supplement\" to mean \"making an addition to the human diet using beta- alanine, which is not a natural or conventional food, to be administered over a period of time and that effectively in- creases athletic performance.\" J.A. 574. It proposed con- struing \"supplying the beta which is not part of a dipeptide , polypeptide or oligopeptide , as a single ingredi- ent in a manufacturing step of the human dietary supple- ment\" to mean \"providing th e free amino acid beta -alanine, an ester of beta -alanine or an amide of beta- alanine in a step of making an addition to the human diet using beta - alanine as the only active ingredient, which is not a natural or conventional food, which effectively increases athletic performance when administered to a human over a period of time.\" J.A. 575. It propose d construing \"mixing the beta- alanin e, which is not part of a dipeptide, polypeptide or oligopeptide, in combination with at least one other in-gredient for the manufacture of the human dietary supple-ment\" to mean \"making an addition to the human diet, NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 20 which is not a natural or conv entional food, and which ef- fectively increases athletic performance when adminis- tered to a human over a period of time, using the free amino acid beta -alanine, an ester of beta -alanine or an amide of beta- alanine and at least one other ingredient.\" J.A. 575. The district court held claim 1 of the '610 patent is di- rected to \"the natural phenomenon beta alanine and the natural law that ingesting certain levels of beta -alanine will increase the carnosine concentration in human tissue.\" J.A. 24. We do not agree. The M anufacturing Claims are not directed to the natural law or product of nature, but instead are an application of the law and new use of that product. Claim 1 of the '610 patent is even further removed from the natural law and product of nature a t issue in the Method Claims and Product Claims , respectively . It is di- rected to the manufacture of a human dietary supplement with certain characteristics. The supplement is not a prod- uct of nature and the use of the supplement to achieve a given result is not directed to a law of nature. We do not see, therefore, how a claim to the manufacture of a non- natural supplement would be directed to the law of nature or natural product. C ONCLUSION The claims at issue are not directed to ineligible subject matter under step one of the Alice test. We live in the nat- ural world, and all inventions are constrained by the laws of nature. As the Supreme Court has warned, we must be careful not to overly abstract claims when perform ing the Alice analysis. For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's decision that the claims are directed to inel-igible subject matter, and we remand for further proceed- ings consistent with this opinion. REVERSED AND REMANDED United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ______________________ NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTERNATIONAL, INC., Plaintiff- Appellant v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS, LLC, Defendant -Appellee DOES 1 -100, CORE SUP PLEMENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC., HONEY BADGER, LLC, MYOPHARMA, INC., Defendants ______________________ 2018- 1295 ______________________ Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Californi a in No. 3:16- cv-02146-H- AGS, Judge Marilyn L. Huff. ______________________ REYNA , Circuit Judge , concurring -in-part, dissenting -in- part. reverses the district court's grant of Cre- ative Compounds' motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), which alleged that the asserted patents claim patent ineligible subject matter under 3 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, and remand s the case for further proceeding s. I dissent from my colleagues' broad NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 2 stroke of eligibility , primarily because I conclude that the majority 's \u00a7 101 analysis relies on an erroneous claim con- struction . I concur, however, in the result reached by the majority to remand for further proceedings , which I expect permits the district court to revisit the \u00a7 101 question un- der a proper claim construction.1 DISCUSSION In construing claims, we give words the ordinary and customary meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc). In some cases, the ordinary meaning \"may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly un derstood words.\" Id. at 1314. This is such a case . For example, applying ordinary and customary meaning to the terms of claim 1 of the '0 84 patent, I would conclude as a matter of law that the claim is ineligible un- der \u00a7 101. Claim 1 of the '084 patent recites: 1. A human dietary supplement, comprising a beta - alanine in a unit dosage of between about 0.4 grams to 16 grams, wherein the supplement pro-vides a unit dosage of beta -alanine. 1 See O2 Micro Int 'l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., 521 F.3d 1351, 1362 -63 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\"When the parties present a fundamental dispute regarding the scope of a claim term, it is the court's duty to resolve it. Because we determine that the district court is in the best position to determine the proper construction of this claim term in the first instance, we remand for further proceedings con- sistent with this opinion.\") . NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 3 '084 p atent col. 22 ll. 26- 29. Claim 1 is directed to what is undis putedly a naturally occurring substance , beta -ala- nine. See id. ; Appellant Br . 4. This natural substance is applied by wholly conventional and natural means , adding it to a human's diet. Claim 1 disclose s nothing else. In particular, the c laim disclose s no basis to argue that the claimed beta -alanine is transformed into something other than beta -alanine. Claim 1, therefore, recites patent ineli- gible subject matter. The majority conclude s that claim 1 is patent eligible . My main concern with its anal ysis is that it relies on a claim construction that improperly import s limitations into the claims and is contradicted by the written description. This may be an unavoidable result given the lack of claim construction in this case. Natural Alternatives argued that the district court should construe the claims before resolving the motion for judgment on the pleadings . Creative Compounds asserted that, for purposes of the m otion, the claims were ineligible both under its proposed construction and Natural Alterna- tives' proposed construction. The district court did not construe the claims, nor did it conclusively adopt either party's proposed claim con- struction. Instead, the court determined that , for purposes of the motion, it would review the claims under Natural Alternatives' proposed claim construction , an approach that, in the district court's view, would obviate the need to defer deciding the m otion until after it conducted claim construction.2 2 The majority points out that neither party argued for a different construction on appeal. But I believe that is only a reflection of the procedural posture of this case. This appeal concerns the district court's grant of a Rule 12(c) motion, where the court adopted Natural Alternatives' NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 4 On appeal, Natural Alternatives argues that the dis- trict court ignored its proposed claim construction. Appel- lant Br. 19 -20. Natural Alternatives asserts that we should adopt its proposed construction and \"remand the case back to the District Court to engage in the proper pro- cedure directed by Markman .\" Appellant Br. 2. As to c laim 1 of the '08 4 patent, Natural Alternatives proposed the following c laim construction to the district court : (1) \"human dietary supplement \" be construed as \"an addition to the human di et, ingested as a pill, capsule, powder or liquid, which is not a natu- ral or conventional food, meat or food flavoring or extract, or pharmaceutical product which effec- tively increases the function of a tissue when ad- ministered to the human over a period of time\" J.A. 14 n.8 . (2) \"dietary supplement \" be construed as \" an addition to the human diet, which is not a natural or conventional food, which effectively increases athletic performance and is manufactured to be used over a period of time. \" J.A. 14 n.8 . Creative Compounds proposed that \"dietary supple- ment\" be construed as: \"An ingredient such as a vitamin, mineral, herb, am ino acid, concentrate, or extract intended for ingestion, which adds further nutritional value to the diet by increasing tissue fu nction .\" J.A. 586. proposed construction to evaluate patent eligibility in plaintiff's favor . Because of that, the appeal was premised under Natural Alternatives' construction. On remand, however, I do not read the majority's decision as one that precludes claim construction. NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 5 I find that Natural Alternatives' construction of \"hu- man dietary supplement\" and \"dietary supplement\" im- properly imports limitation s into the claims , incorporates a defi nition that is contrary to the plain meaning of the terms , and is flawed because it is contradicted by the writ- ten description . For example, t he construction imports the limitation that beta- alanine \"effectively increases the function of a tissue when administered to the human over a period of time.\" 3 This limitation is not disclosed in the plain lan- guage of the claims and is only present by virtue of the pro- posed claim construction.4 3 Likewise, for claim 6 of the '376 patent, the added limitation is that it \" effectively increases athletic perfor- mance when administered to the human over a period of time.\" 4 The majority states that it is not accurate to criti- cize the claims on the basis that the \"effective\" limitation does not appear i n the plain language of the claims. I dis- agree. First, w hile some of the asserted claims use the word \"effective,\" not all do. Claim 1 of the '084 patent is independent and does not include any reference to effec- tiveness. T he majority's citations to ot her claims within the '084 patent do not detract from my basic point that \"di- etary supplement\" or \"human dietary supplement\" do not, alone, import an effectiveness component as the proposed construction requires. Likewise, none of the asserted claims of t he '376 patent include any reference to effective- ness. Second, if \"dietary supplement,\" as a term, included an effectiveness component, this would undermine the ne- cessity for claim 1 of the '865 patent to use the term \"effec- tive.\" In other words, the fac t that some claims use \"effective\" to reflect that limitation undercuts a construc- tion that such limitation exists within the definition of \"di-etary supplement\" or \"human dietary supplement.\" Lastly, NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 6 Natural Alternatives' proposed c onstruction are also contradicted by the written description . For example, the proposed construction of \"human dietary supplement\" lim- its the claim in the '084 patent to dietary supplements that are: (1) ingested in pill, capsule, powder, or liquid form; (2) not meat or food flavoring or extract, or a pharmaceutical product; (3) effective to increase the function of tissues over time; and (4) not natural or conventional food. Appellant Br. 20; J.A. 14 n.8. Yet the specification notes that \"[t] he compositions of the invention can be used for the prepara- tion of a dietary supplement (including , e.g., drinks, gels, foods) or pharmaceutical composition s for humans or ani- mals. \" '084 patent col. 5 ll. 13- 16. O n the one hand , the construction exclude s pharmaceutical products and foods , while on the other hand , the specification expressly in- clude s foods within the definition of \" dietary supplement\" and expands the scope of the invention to include \"pharma- ceutical compositions\" for humans or animals. Interestingly, the District of Delaware, in evaluating a related patent , declined to construe \"dietary supplement,\" holding that the term was not a limitation. Natural Alter-natives Int'l Inc. v. Vital Pharm. Inc., No. 1:09 -CV-00626, Dkt. No. 125 at 2 (D. Del. May 31, 2011) (\"Delaware Or- der\") . The court noted that \"dietary su pplement\" appeared only in the preamble of the claims and that the specifica-tions did not demonstrate that the term was a necessary aspect of the invention. 5 Id. even for the claims that use \"effective,\" that limitati on still depends on Natural Alternatives' proposed claim construc-tion of \"effective\" as \"elevat[ing] beta -alanine above natural levels to cause an increase in the synthesis of beta -alanyl- histidine dipeptide in the tissue.\" J.A. 579 -81 (emphasis added). 5 The majority contends that, through this citation, I am incorrectly suggesting that \"dietary supplement\" may NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 7 Natural Alternative s' construction also defin es \"human dietary supplement\" to \"effective ly increase []\" the function of a tissue over time.6 J.A. 14 n.8. This definition is not be a limitation. To be clear, that is what the District of Delaware held, and I raise that holding to underscore the complexities about the pr oposed construction, particularly because one of the patents at issue in the Delaware case (U.S. Patent. No. 6,426,361) had similar claims as those here. For example, claims 1 and 5 of the '361 patent recite: 1. A composition comprising a mixture of a creatine and a composition comprising an amino acid or an active derivative thereof s elected from the group consisting of a beta -alanine, an ester of a beta -ala- nine beta- alanine. . . . . 5. A dietary supplement comprising a mixture of a creatine and a composition comprising an amino acid or an active derivative thereof selected from the group consisting of a beta -alanine, an ester of a beta- alanine and an amide of a beta- alanine. '361 patent col. 15 ll. 17- 21, 30- 34. In concluding that \"di- etary supplement\" was not a limitation, the court pointed out that \"the specification simply notes that the claimed 'composition can be a dietary supplement.'\" Delaware Or- der at 2 (citing '361 patent col. 3 l. 41 (emphasis in origi- nal)). The claims implic ated in this case are similar to those in the Delaware Order, and the written descriptions likewise include this permissive \u2014yet non -restrictive \u2014lan- guage. E.g. , '569 patent '376 patent col. 6 l. 48; '084 patent col. 6 l. 52; '865 patent col. 6 l. 53; '610 patent col. 6 l. 54. 6 For the '376 patent the construction defines \"die- tary supplement\" to effectively athletic perfor-mance. J.A. NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 8 contrary to t he plain meaning of the term : \"a product taken orally that contains one or more ingredients which are in- tended to supplement one' s diet and are not considered food.\"7 Nor is this a case where the patentee has acted as its own lexicographer. Thorner v. Sony Entm 't Am. F.3d 1362, 2012) . To do so, \"a patentee must ' clearly set forth a definition of the dis- puted claim term ' other than its plain and ordinary mean- ing.\" Id. (quoting CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp. , 288 F.3d 1359, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ). Nowhere does the pa- tentee set forth such a definition.8 This court i s hesitant to construe claims for the first time on appea l. Meyer Intellectual Prop s. Ltd. v. Bodum, Inc., 690 F.3d 1354, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2012) . This tendency reflects a concern to avoid conflating de novo review with 7 Dietary supplement , Merriam -Webster Una- bridged, http://unabridged.merriam , 415 F.3d at 1314 (general purpose dictionaries are helpful when con-struction involves widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words); Optical Disc Corp. v. Del Mar Avionics, 208 F.3d 1324, 1334 -35 (Fed . Cir. 2000) (\"Without evidence in the patent specification of an express intent to impart an innovative meaning to a claim term, the term takes on its ordinary meaning. For such ordinary meaning, we turn to the dictionary definition of the term.\" (intern al citations omitted)). 8 Notably, t he definitions of \"dietary supplement\" set out by the Food and Drug Administration , J.A. 590, and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, 21 U.S.C . \u00a7 321(ff), also do not reflect a functional/effectiveness com- ponent within the meaning of the term. That is, these def-initions do not support a finding that the effective increase of athletic performance or tissue function is embedded within the meaning of \"dietary supplement .\" NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v. CREATIVE COMPOUNDS , LLC 9 an independent analysis in the first instance. See Wavetro- nix LLC v. EIS Elec. Integrated Sys. , 1343, 1355 (Fed. 2009) (noting this court's review of claim con- struction without deference is not an independent analysis in the first instance (citing Nazomi Commc'ns, Inc. v. Arm Holdings, PLC , 403 F.3d 1364, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2005))) . Construing on appeal , however, is proper under lim- ited circumstances, particularly when the record is suffi- ciently developed to enable constru ction. 573 F.3d at 1355. I do not see such a record in this case. Apparently, the majority agrees because it too d id not construe the claim s, but rather choose to rely on the construction proposed by Natural Al- ternative s. If anything, this appeal w as pre -ordained to result in a remand. The district court decided the Rule 12(c) motion at the pleading stage while acknowledging that it c ould de- fer its decision until after it conducted claim construction . On appeal, Natural Alternative s argue s that th e district court erred when it decided not to conduct claim construc- tion before deciding the m otion. T he majority remands to the district court for further proceedings , which I take to mean could include a formal claim construction and a po- tential revisit of the \u00a7 101 issue. I would remand because I believe the district court and the majority relied on an erroneous claim construction. So, the question is whether anything meaningful has been achieved in these circumstances . This case , and the gen- eral de velopment of the law concerning \u00a7 101 analysis at the pleading stage , cause s me to ask whether the time has come for this court to reconsider whether a Rule 12(c) mo- tion based on \u00a7 101 should be decided before claim con- struction. See Bancorp Servs., L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assur. Canada (U.S.) 687 F.3d 1266, 1273 -74 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (\"[I]t will ordinarily be desirable \u2014and often necessary \u2014to resolve claim construction disputes prior to a \u00a7 101 analy- sis, for the determination of patent eligibility requires a full NATURAL ALTERNATIVES INTL . v.
