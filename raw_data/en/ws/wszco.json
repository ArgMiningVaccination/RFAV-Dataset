Chemical and Biological Exposures Utilize this Comprehensive Epidemiologic Data Resource Most of CEDR's holdings are derived from epidemiologic studies of DOE workers at many large nuclear weapons plants, such as Hanford, Los Alamos, the Oak Ridge reservation, Savannah River Site, and Rocky Flats. These studies have primarily used death certificate information to identify excess deaths and patterns of disease among workers to determine what factors contribute to the risk of developing cancer and other illnesses. In addition, many of these studies have radiation exposure measurements on individual workers. CompTox Chemicals Dashboard The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs DoD's Environmental Exposures Environmental Impact Review at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) performs an essential public health task by making sure that safe and effective drugs are available to improve the health of people in the United States. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires all Federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of their actions and to ensure that the interested and affected public is informed of the environmental analyses. FDA considers the environmental impacts of its actions as an integral part of its regulatory process. FDA regulations at 21 CFR Part 25 (\"Environmental Impact Considerations\") specify that environmental assessments (EAs) must be submitted as part of certain new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), applications for marketing approval for biological product, supplements to such applications, investigational new drug applications (INDs) and for various other actions, unless the action qualifies for a categorical exclusion.
