Learn more here. [wolfberry](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/wellness-and-nutrition/natural-wellness/goji-berry-health-benefits/) would be among the A-list stars. Though tiny, its size belies the impressive list of wolfberry benefits. This fruit was first mentioned as a powerhouse herb around 200 BCE in the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing (), one of the definitive texts in [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/traditional-chinese-medicine/). These early reports described this fruit as a medicine typically included in mild tonics, tinctures, and powders. The berries have also been consumed as [tea](https://www.euyansang.com.my/en_MY/pai-du-ming-mu-tea-955616070144.html), juice, wine, or liqueur. The shrub that wolfberry grows can be found between Southeast Europe and Southwest Asia. However, the north-central and western regions of China, specifically Ningxia, Gansu, and Xinjiang, are regarded as the native home of the fruit as medicine. As word of its benefits spread, cultivation expanded outside China into other Asian countries early in the 21st century. Today, the global wolfberry market also includes Italy, Portugal, Greece, and several other European nations. Find out how [wolfberry](https://www.euyansang.com.my/en_MY/everyday-botanica-goji-berries-955616020122.html), also known as [goji berry](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/glossary/goji-berry/), can benefit your health. 7 Wolfberry Benefits According to TCM and Western Medicine The following are evidence-based benefits of the fruit, which has been used as a medicinal health food for at least 2,000 years. 1. Wolfberry is a powerful antioxidant In TCM, the wolfberry is considered a sweet herb with a calm nature. Thousands of years of carefully documented observation within TCM revealed that sweet herbs like wolfberry temper acute reactions within the body, ridding it of harmful free radicals. TCM believes this antioxidant activity has a tonic effect on the [Liver](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/health-and-balance/internal-health/maintain-healthy-liver-function/) and [Kidney](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/health-and-balance/internal-health/kidney-function/), replenishing qi (vital life force) and blood. Research also confirms goji berry's antioxidant activity. A 2015 study in the Journal of Functional Foods found that wolfberry is a \"rich source of antioxidant compounds.\" It is in cinnamic acids, catechins (flavonoids), organic acids, lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamin A and vitamin C \u2014 all correlated to strong antioxidant properties that help fight free radicals in the body. 2. Wolfberry can help boost your immune response Research suggests that goji berry can help increase the efficacy of the flu vaccine among the elderly even after getting the flu, as illustrated in a study among mice. A 2013 study in The Journal of Nutrition demonstrated that aged male mice caught the virus after being fed a 5% wolfberry diet for 30 days and vaccinated against [influenza](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/health-and-balance/energy-and-immunity/influenza-symptoms/) afterwards had higher antibodies in their blood. These mice also had milder symptoms compared to those that were vaccinated alone. 3. It helps protect against ageing-related vision loss Another wolfberry benefit is its ability to improve [eyesight](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/wellness-and-nutrition/natural-wellness/do-away-with-eye-floaters/), especially in older age. Wolfberry falls in the category of tonic herbs for a [vision](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/health-and-balance/internal-health/blurred-vision/) In a 2021 study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers found that wolfberry increased the levels of carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin in the retina. On the other hand, there was no increase in these pigments in the group that was given a commercial eye supplement. These carotenoids protect against macular degeneration, which manifests as loss of central vision. 4. It is great for the skin Wolfberry's ability to fight radicals also extends to the berry's power in wound healing and fighting ageing skin. Animal models showed that ingested wolfberry juice could protect the skin from sun damage. Studies on human skin samples also shower that wolfberry's bioactive compounds stimulate the production of [collagen](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/health-and-balance/muscles-and-bones/collagen-peptides-benefits/) - the protein that gives your skin its youthful bounce. 5. It may help protect against Alzheimer's In TCM, the Kidneys regulate the urinary system but also play a role in the reproductive system, including growth and ageing. Meanwhile, the Liver regulates the movement of qi and body fluids to balance your emotions. And because wolfberry is helpful for the Kidneys and Liver, according to TCM, it can rein in ageing processes and slow down the onset of [dementia](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/health-and-balance/healthy-ageing/dementia-treatment/). Researchers from the Institute of Biophysics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences also found that wolfberry can break down the amyloid-beta protein plaques in the brain believed to cause Alzheimer's disease. 6. Wolfberry can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease A 2017 study in Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity investigated the effects of goji berry on patients with metabolic syndrome, a combination of conditions that raises your risk of [heart disease](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/health-and-balance/internal-health/ways-to-prevent-heart-disease/), type 2 diabetes, stroke, and related health problems. In this experiment, a group of patients were given 14 grams of natural goji berry on top of their healthy diet for 45 days. The patients in a control group were only given a healthy diet. The researchers found that the patients given goji berries had reduced waistline circumference compared to the control group. This suggests that goji berries can be used as dietary supplements for those at risk of cardiovascular diseases. 7. It can help manage diabetes Wolfberry has hypoglycaemic properties, as shown in a study published in the International Organization of Scientific Research Journal of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences. In the experiment, researchers induced [diabetes](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-my/health-and-balance/internal-health/diabetes-mellitus/) among male rats. The diabetic rats that were given dry wolfberry fruit powder for four weeks had lower fasting blood glucose compared to diabetic rats fed with a normal diet. Wolfberry also helped treat the diabetic rats' damaged tissues in the kidneys and pancreas. Who Shouldn't Take Wolfberry? The fruit is mainly non-toxic. Only a handful of allergic reactions have been reported for the past decade. However, a 2015 study in the journal Lycium Barbarum and Human Health reports that new allergic reactions to wolfberry are becoming more frequent. These cases range from mild localised reactions in the oral cavity to anaphylactic reactions, including urticaria and rhinitis. There are also risks of possible drug interactions, especially among those who are on blood thinners like warfarin. A 2015 study in the journal Toxicology Reports showed a possible association between high doses of The benefits of [wolfberry](https://www.euyansang.com.my/en_MY/everyday-botanica-qi-zi-wang-955616020162.html) have made it a superstar in the realm of superfoods. These berries work best when incorporated into a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Speak to a TCM physician if you want to add wolfberries to your diet for their benefits.
