I'm a board-certified acupuncturist and traditional Chinese herbalist. I discovered this profound medicine while going through my own healing journey. Along the way, I realized I had a knack for listening and helping others also navigate their chronic illness, anxiety, and stress. Flash forward 5 years and my process is now a refined, zen-inducing machine that leaves both me and my clients on Cloud 9. Curious? Of course you are! I think you landed here for a reason. \"My goal is to help you reconnect with the part of yourself that already knows the way towards healing. Sometimes our bodies just need a little reminder \" Jess Mkrtchyan Your Acupuncturist It's called acupuncture, baby Look it up It's called acupuncture, baby Look it up It's called acupuncture, baby Look it up It's called acupuncture, baby Look it up It's called acupuncture, baby Look it up Rituals How far we go is totally up to you. Acupuncture You're ready to do The Work. My acupuncture treatments are completely customized to your specific needs & wellness goals. My approach combines both traditional and modern modalities to target the root cause of your symptoms so that they go away - for good. Facial Rejuvenation & Gua Sha Get ready to GLOW Facial rejuvenation treatments are intended to release facial tension (the true culprit for advanced aging patterns). Fine needles encourage oxygenated blood flow to the skin's surface to naturally boost collagen production, reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. Fire Cupping If you like massage...you will LOVE cupping Fire cupping is a non-invasive massage alternative that is designed to relieve muscle tension, calm the nervous system, and detoxify the tissues via the lymphatic system. Herbal Medicine My tonics, elixirs, & infusions are hand-selected to complement your acupuncture treatment protocol. There is a reason Chinese herbal medicine has been around for thousands of years...it really works wonders!
