TCM offers an unique perspective on the nature of health & illness that is different from that of the western perspective. TCM utilises the body's own healing abilities. It holds the human body in great reverence, respecting & promoting its endless capacity for rejuvenation & recovery. TCM is a complete medical system that has been used to diagnose, treat, and prevent illnesses for more than 5,000 years. TCM is based on a belief in yin and yang - defined as opposing energies, such as earth and heaven, winter and summer, happiness and sadness. When yin and yang are in balance, you feel relaxed and energized. When out of balance, yin and yang negatively affect your health. TCM believes that there is a life force or energy in everybody known as qi (pronounced \"chee\"). In order for yin and yang to be balanced and for the body to be healthy, qi must be balanced and flowing freely. When there's too little or too much qi in one of the body's energy pathways (called meridians), or when the flow of qi is blocked, illness results. The ultimate goal of TCM treatment is to balance the yin and yang in our lives by promoting the natural flow of qi. At present one quarter of the world's population makes use of TCM therapies.
