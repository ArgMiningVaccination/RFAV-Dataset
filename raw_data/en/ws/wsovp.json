While Apple considers compliance with this Standard to be the minimum a Supplier must do to remain in Apple's supply chain, a Supplier should seek to go beyond the minimum and apply any relevant best practices wherever possible. Apple anticipates that in the future, only Suppliers exceeding minimum requirements and operating at the best practices level are likely to remain in Apple's supply chain. Supplier Code of Conduct Requirements Suppliers shall exercise due diligence on Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials in their Supply Chain. Suppliers shall develop particular due diligence policies and management systems in order to identify applicable risks and take appropriate steps to mitigate them. Due diligence shall be conducted to the material processing level in order to determine whether relevant materials originate from High Risk Regions, including areas associated with conflict, the worst forms of child labor, forced labor and human trafficking, gross human rights violations such as widespread sexual violence, or other reasonably objective high risk activities, including severe health and safety risks and negative environmental impacts. Supplier Responsibility Standards 1. Due Diligence System, Policy, and Use of Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials 1.1 Supplier Due Diligence Management System Suppliers shall develop an appropriate management system to conduct due diligence in accordance with the standards set out in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (the \"OECD Guidance\") and other applicable international standards, as described in this Standard (see Section 6 of this Standard). For Suppliers using Relevant Materials, see also the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains (the \"OECD-FAO Guidance\"). A due diligence management system shall include: Risk identification Risk prevention and mitigation Responsible Sourcing of Materials Version: 4.8 Effective date: January 1, 2022Definitions Supply Chain The path of a supply from a point of origin, such as a mine for mined materials, a farm for biologically grown materials, or a point of collection for recycled materials, to Apple, which for a Supplier may include owned, operated, direct and/or indirect sourcing through a Subcontractor, Supplier, Processor, Mining Company or other source from which a Relevant Material may be mined, biologically grown, processed, traded, recycled, compounded, refined, or manufactured into Goods used by the Supplier in Apple products. Processors Any entity that smelts or refines Relevant Materials or the point at which the Relevant Materials are first processed. For minerals, this would constitute processing from ore into refined metal or the re-processing of scrap or other waste into recycled or re-used content (typically a smelter, refiner, or recycler). For other materials, such as Bio-materials, this would constitute processing from farmed commodity into a refined or isolated byproduct (such as a mill or tannery), a precursor or a compound. Additionally, if the Processor sources materials from a trader or exchange, the Processor should ensure that those intermediaries have policies to the primary production level, the original source of primary ore at the mining level, or the agricultural commodity at the farm level. Processor and/or Trader Includes those who process or recycle Relevant Materials, recycled materials, or perform aggregation of relevant materials.Supplier Responsibility Standard118Third Party verifications or audits of Supply Chain due diligence A mechanism for reporting applicable risks. 1.2 Supplier Policy Requirements Suppliers shall have a due diligence policy that is consistent with OECD Guidance and/or the OECD-FAO Guidance (as applicable), and this Standard. The policy shall also require Processors in the Supplier's Supply Chain to have corresponding due diligence policies down to the level of the Source or Origin, which includes the level of Mining Companies, farms, collection points of Recyclable Waste, or the original source of primary ore at the mining level. Suppliers shall ensure that their facilities and suppliers comply with the obligations and requirements of this Standard. 1.3 Supplier Policy Distribution For Relevant Minerals, Suppliers shall distribute their policies to: All subcontractors and suppliers that produce Goods for use in Apple's products Supplier procurement personnel and factory management. For Relevant Materials, Suppliers shall distribute their policies to Apple. As appropriate, Apple may require a Supplier to distribute their policies further. 1.4 Use of Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials Suppliers shall not use Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials in any Goods produced for use in Apple's products if a Supplier cannot reasonably demonstrate that it has a due diligence management system and has performed the required due diligence activities, as outlined below. To the extent that a Supplier seeks only to implement a due diligence management system and perform required due diligence activities with respect to specific Apple-related supply lines, Apple may require, as appropriate, such Supplier to (i) demonstrate to Apple a reasonably comprehensive system to segregate Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials for use in Apple's products from Relevant Materials or Relevant Materials used in other parties' products and (ii) undergo a Third Party verification or audit of such a segregation system. In addition to the requirements pertaining to Relevant Materials, the following use restrictions apply to the use of leather in Goods: Only domesticated bovines (limited to cow, steer, bull, calf, or oxen) raised for food production may be used. Leather originating from wild bovines (including but not limited to bison, water or cape buffalo), exotic species (including but not limited to shark, crocodile, or snake), or bovines raised only for their skin or hide (i.e., non-food sourced) are not permitted. No Endangered or Threatened Species (defined as species listed on the red list by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) shall be used. No leathers from animals raised or slaughtered in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India or Morocco shall be used. Animals in the production of leather, including at the farm, in transport, or at any other point in the Supply Chain shall not be treated inhumanely. Responsible Sourcing of Materials Version: 4.8 Effective date: January 1, 2022Definitions Mining Companies Any entity that mines or manages mining operations of Relevant Minerals and produces primary ore.
