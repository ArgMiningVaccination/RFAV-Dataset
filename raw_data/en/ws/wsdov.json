Once the tissue has been identified I will work with your body via the chiropractic adjustment and other physical therapy modalities to help the healing process. Born and raised in Lawrence Kansas, Dr. Tyler Campbell is excited to provide chiropractic care to his hometown. He graduated from Cleveland University-Kansas City with a Bachelor degree in Human Biology and a Doctorate in Chiropractic. In his childhood he had headaches almost daily. Luckily, his mom cleaned for Dr. James Dray who provided chiropractic care to Tyler. He spent many nights amazed by the posters of the different body systems while cleaning Dr. Dray's office with his mom and brothers. From then on Tyler has always been fascinated by the human body and has been headache free. "}
