It actually allows one to gain a healthy perspective about life through improving self-awareness. Meditation can help lower stress, improve focus, understand your pain, and improve brain function. Mind set is one of the most powerful tools available to us as humans. Meditation is very simple but can be more difficult than most may think. Here are some steps to follow to ensure a good meditation session: - Find a calm and quiet place to site - Set a timer for 5 or 10 minutes if you're a beginner - Pay attention to your body. Make sure you are sitting comfortably in a position you can stay in for a while. Some actually choose to lie down. - Focus on your breathing. Pay attention to how breathing in and out feels. - Notice when your mind begins to wander away from your focused breathing. - Don't get mad at yourself if your mind wanders. Just focus back on your breathing. - When you are ready to end your session. Slowly open your eyes if you had them closed and slowly start to notice your environment, how your body feels, your thoughts, and your emotions.
