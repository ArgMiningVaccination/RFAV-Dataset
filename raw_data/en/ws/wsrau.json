Surprising things happen to your body when you quit smoking. By: Dr. [Thiviyanath Sellathurai](https://providers.geisinger.org/provider/Thiviyanath+Sellathurai/1328556), family medicine doctor at [Geisinger's Phillipsburg clinic](https://locations.geisinger.org/details.cfm?id=101) Are you thinking about quitting smoking? You'll get big benefits from head to toe. And whether you're a new smoker or you've been smoking for years, it's never too late to quit. What happens when you quit smoking? After you smoke your last cigarette, your body begins to change. In fact, you'll start to get the benefits of quitting smoking within minutes. 1. Your blood pressure goes down. The nicotine in cigarettes can increase your blood pressure, raising your risk of [heart attack](/patient-care/conditions-treatments-specialty/heart-attack) or stroke. But 20 minutes after your last cigarette, your blood pressure starts to normalize. 2. Your oxygen levels rise. Within just 8 hours of quitting smoking, your body's oxygen levels increase. And your lung function will begin to improve. As your lungs start to heal, you may: - Feel less short of breath - Cough less - Breathe easier - Have more stamina, especially during exercise 3. Your risk of developing cancer decreases. After you take that final puff, your risk of [developing lung cancer](/health-and-wellness/wellness-articles/2020/12/14/20/01/do-you-need-a-lung-cancer-screening) is cut in half. Your risk for developing esophageal, bladder and [pancreatic](/health-and-wellness/wellness-articles/2019/03/21/18/20/5-factors-that-increase-your-risk-of-pancreatic-cancer) cancers decreases, too. 4. Your skin, hair and nails look better. Smoking stains your teeth and nails with a yellow film. It can also dull your skin and make your hair brittle. Quitting improves blood flow, making your skin look more radiant. Your smile will look brighter after you take that final drag, too. 5. Your sense of taste and smell improves. Smoking deadens nerve endings in your mouth and nose, which dulls your sense of taste and smell. But when you stop smoking, these nerve endings start to regenerate. And your sense of taste and smell reawaken. With your tastebuds back to life, you may find a whole new appreciation for your favorite foods.
