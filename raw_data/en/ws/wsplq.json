The Professional Standards Authority (PSA) said on Thursday that it would be renewing its accreditation of the Society of Homeopaths on the condition it could no longer claim to treat certain conditions. In a statement on the PSA website it said the society must make clear that members must not practice or advertise therapies for autism. \"Specific reference must be made to the society's position forbidding the practice of CEASE and dietary/nutritional supplements,\" it said. CEASE stands for Complete Elimination of Austistic Spectrum Expression and was invented by a Dutch doctor called Tinus Smits who died of cancer in 2010. The therapy reportedly involves \"detoxing children of the vaccines and antibiotics\" held responsible for the condition through extremely high doses of Vitamin C and dietary changes. Numerous studies, including one of 650,000 children in 2018, have conclusively stated that the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine does not cause autism. As well as forbidding the use of CEASE therapy, the PSA said homeopaths should stop advising on vaccinations or suggesting homeopathy is a substitute for vaccines. Instead homeopaths should refer all patients to the NHS for further guidance on this matter. Homeopathy isn't widely available on the NHS and in 2017 NHS England recommended GPs and other prescribers stop providing it to patients.

Rex Features 16 male celebrities who have spoken about mental health Rob Delaney Catastrophe actor and comedian Rob Delaney, who lost his son Henry to brain cancer in January 2018, said he has long struggled with depression and encouraged others in the same position to seek help. \"Asking for help is strong because it leads directly to staying alive,\" he says. \"Not asking for help is as fear-based a decision as a human being can make and can lead you swiftly in a bad direction. It's not exaggerating to say that path can end in death.\" Rex Features 16 male celebrities who have spoken about mental health Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Dwayne Johnson has spoken on numerous occasions about mental health.

Regardless of who you are or what you do for a living or where you come from, it doesn't discriminate, we all kind of go through it. If I could share a little bit of it and if I could help somebody, I'm happy to do it.\" Rex Features 16 male celebrities who have spoken about mental health Ryan Reynolds \"I have anxiety, I've always had anxiety,\" the Deadpool actor told the New York Times in 2018. \"Both in the lighthearted 'I'm anxious about this' kind of thing, and I've been to the depths of the darker end of the spectrum, which is not fun.\" Reynolds said he went through a period of partying to try and make himself \"vanish\" in some way and would frequently suffer with anxiety-related insomnia. Rex Features 16 male celebrities who have spoken about mental health Bruce Springsteen Bruce 'The Boss' Springsteen told Esquire magazine in 2018 that although he wouldn't describe himself as being mentally unwell, he has \"come close enough\" and takes medication to cope. \"I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and the wheels can come off a little bit.\" Rex Features 16 male celebrities who have spoken about mental health Prince Harry Prince Harry has been a vocal supporter of mental health campaigns like 'Time To Talk'.

Rex Features Homeopathy is a \"treatment\" based on the use of highly diluted substances, which practitioners claim can cause the body to heal itself, according to the NHS. A 2010 House of Commons committee report on homeopathy concluded homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebo treatments. A 2018 study found people who use homeopathy as part of their cancer treatment are, on average, twice as likely to die from the disease as those who use conventional treatment only. The PSA has faced a legal challenge over its decision to accredit the Society of Homeopaths and in October Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, demanded the accreditation was revoked. Emily Buttrum, chief executive of the Society of Homeopaths, said: \"Accreditation by the PSA ensures that patients can choose to see a homeopath belonging to a register that upholds robust standards. The PSA oversees medical professions, reviewing bodies such as the General Medical Council. "}
